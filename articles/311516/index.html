They can revive and kill, throw and lower to the bottom.  All the daily activities that we perform on the machine are habits.  They control us: affect mood, development and health.  The introduction of good habits, as an investment in a profitable project, brings dividends day after day with virtually no participation.  You just have to eliminate bad habits, select useful ones and see how the world around you is changing. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  All my achievements: personal, professional and financial, were the result of making small changes in life, which over time brought results. <br><br>  Over the past three years I have managed to work as a web developer, author of articles for a men's magazine, and chief product designer.  I visited two countries, moved from a hostel to a comfortable apartment and continue to work with habits, as one of the most important development tools.

      These 10 habits have changed my life: <br><br><h3>  Fear </h3><br>  At the age of 18, I first went on stage to present the project.  It has been more than a day of continuous work.  I was the youngest in the team, but they sent me to submit the project.  It was scary.  In the dark, I was blinded by a bright light, and I saw almost no one.  Representatives of large IT companies asked questions, and I tried to answer them.  It was scary, but I knew that this opportunity should not be missed.  Several years have passed since then, and that moment remains one of the most memorable in my life. <br><br>  <u>Why overcome fear?</u> <br><br>  Each exit from the comfort zone proves that we are capable of more.  This gives confidence that all obstacles are surmountable.  After all, it is, but to develop the habit of ignoring fear is not easy. <br><br>  <u>How to start?</u> <br><br>  Fear is a signal that it's time to act.  Two days ago, I met a famous artist and immediately approached him.  We talked a couple of minutes and broke up.  Nothing complicated.  Saw a beautiful girl / man?  Come on.  I had a crazy idea to wake up at dawn and go for a run?  Get up!  Without doing this, you will regret.  Over time, self-pity will become a habit, and dreams will remain dreams.  What would you like?  To write a book?  Open a company?  Never mind.  Take action. <br><br>  <u>Important</u> <br>  - Understand that fear almost everything.  This is normal. <br>  - To realize that fear is a common feeling.  Overcome it and discomfort will stop bothering you. <br><br><h3>  Early rise </h3><br>  Two years ago, I began experimenting with early awakening.  Then I studied at the institute, worked as a project manager, wrote articles and studied English.  There was little time, so I started to wake up at 5:30, so that before I left for the institute I would have time to go to the gym and study a foreign language.  I didn‚Äôt endure long, because falling asleep in a hostel before 11 o'clock in the evening is as easy as climbing with the dawn.  Then I had to change the schedule, but this summer I woke up a few days a week when the sun was just beginning to heat, go out, did 10 sprints, came back, prepared meals for the day, sometimes read a book and went to work. <br><br>  <u>Why wake up early?</u> <br><br>  When one thing is done, the second is easier.  Waking up early, doing a jog or a simple task, you will become like a player who scored a goal at the beginning of a match and filled with confidence that he will score more. <br><br>  <u>How to learn to get up early</u> <br><br>  You can list dozens of tips that will help you get up earlier, but none of them can compare with the presence of a goal that is so strong and conscious that it will be stronger than the desire to lie for another hour.  Why do you think students wake up classes?  Maybe because they do not see sense in their studies?  It may well be.  But sadly is not it.  Many adults wake up work for the same reason. <br><br>  <u>Important</u> <br>  - Have a plan for what you do in the morning.  Without this, it is better not to wake up.  It will be more useful. <br>  - To lie down at least 6.5 hours (and preferably 7-8) before climbing. <br>  - Eat intelligently.  Errors in nutrition strongly affect the tone (more on that below). <br>  - To understand that early recovery is not a guarantee of success.  As a result, everyone has 24 hours a day. <br><br><h3>  Fitness </h3><br>  At 16, I weighed 84 kg.  I was fat.  By the end of school, my weight dropped to 62 kg, and after two years I reached a healthy 80-84 with a percentage of subcutaneous fat of 10-12% (this is like Daniel Craig in the films of bondians).  Fitness is not only a healthy body.  He disciplines, makes overcome difficulties and achieve new goals.  These qualities are transferred to all areas of life. <br><br>  <u>Why a healthy lifestyle?</u> <br><br>  Discipline, self-confidence, emotional, mental and physical stability.  And most importantly - the core of life. <br><br>  <u>How to improve health?</u> <br><br>  Everyone knows this: eat right, get enough sleep, move. <br><br>  <u>Important</u> <br>  - Stick to a moderate training regimen.  Do not overwork. <br>  - Allocate time to rest.  There was a time when I trained 7-8 hours a week.  This is permissible at a certain stage, but it will have a bad effect in the long run. <br>  - Carefully refers to every movement.  This will help avoid injuries and speed up growth. <br>  - Progress, give each other a workout and set new goals. <br><br><h3>  Smart power </h3><br>  I have not eaten sweets and pastries for more than two years.  They say to me, "How can you limit yourself so much ?!"  And I do not limit.  I eat what I want.  After all, it is not a diet.  Smart food is a way of life. <br><br>  <u>What for?</u> <br><br>  The level of your energy depends on what you eat.  Take a break and think about how you feel?  Feel sleepy, tired or cheerful?  And now remember what we ate all day. <br><br>  A sprinter needs energy to run no less than you need to complete a task.  It becomes obvious that a healthy diet is the key to success.  Of course, you can swallow a croissant, drink it frappuccino and get the necessary energy vypis.  This will work a couple of times, but in the long term will have a negative impact on health.  Excess sugar, caffeine, fat does not lead to anything good. <br><br>  <u>How to eat smart?</u> <br><br>  Imagine a fire.  It burns while branches are thrown into it.  If you throw a lot at once, it will go out.  If a little he dies.  Similarly, the body needs to be fed from fats, proteins and carbohydrates.  Morning food intake allows you to wake up the body (make a fire), and several meals during the day keep it in the right state.  To eat intelligently, you need to know what foods contain the main components: proteins, fats and carbohydrates. <br><br>  <u>Important</u> <br>  - Understand what products contain empty energy, and what - useful.  Plain sugar is a useless thing, but fruit is not. <br>  - Eat enough protein.  It is the building material of your body. <br>  - Drink at least 2 liters of water per day (I drink several times more).  Without water, everything dies. <br><br><h3>  Goals </h3><br>  I began to set goals at 18. I remember how in the ‚ÄúTarget‚Äù column of the MyKrug service I wrote ‚ÄúBecome a project manager‚Äù.  Bumping into a forgotten resume a year later, I just smiled, since the goal was achieved.  Writing down the goal, the probability of achieving it increases significantly.  She ceases to loom in my head, and you have the opportunity to do business. <br><br>  <u>What for?</u> <br><br>  Goals - life reference points.  They indicate the direction of development and help avoid confusion and stagnation. <br><br>  <u>How to work with goals</u> <br><br>  Now I use a paper notebook.  One page - one week.  I divide the tasks into categories.  I define the priority with a point. <br><br>  Six months ago I used Todoist.  Great app that includes the technique of David Allen GTD.  You have the ability to distribute tasks across projects, filter and set reminders and much more. <br><br>  It is worth paying attention to the <a href="https://smartprogress.do/">SmartProgress</a> service.  This is a complete system for achieving goals.  In addition to the rating that motivates you to accomplish, you can join the group and achieve goals together. <br><br> <a href="https://smartprogress.do/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/623/b96/75d/623b9675d4be4ad69974a661aae30321.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  <u>Important</u> <br>  - To understand that reaching the goal, you will not become happy.  You can be happy just now.  The goal gives an impulse to your life, and it is precisely in the movement towards something ambitious that you feel happy and successful. <br>  - Refuse targets if they have lost their relevance.  This happens with long-term goals. <br><br><h3>  Focus </h3><br>  The return of Steve Jobs to the position of Apple CEO is my favorite moment in his biography.  Returning, Jobs reduced the product line to 4 devices.  What happened next you know yourself. <br><br>  In an interview with Chinese television, the founder of Apple said that in order to create a breakthrough product, you need to focus on one idea and bring it to the ideal. <br><br>  <u>What for?</u> <br><br>  Multitasking is relevant only when performing simple tasks, like talking on the phone while making coffee or imperceptibly looking at girls during a workout.  More complex tasks require greater mental strength.  It is like juggling.  The more balls, the harder.  Now imagine that one ball (a big task) weighs 20 kg.  To throw only one ball you need to concentrate all the forces on it.  The same with tasks. <br><br>  <u>How to concentrate?</u> <br><br>  If you want to achieve something in the selected case, you need to turn off social notifications.  networks, close unnecessary tabs and, if possible, retire.  Work sprints, not marathons.  I have a handy Pomodoro Timer on my laptop.  I use it constantly.  If you are disturbed by external sounds, use the Noisli service. <br><br>  <u>Important</u> <br>  - Remember that the world is changed by people who can focus. <br><br><h3>  Experiments </h3><br>  I experiment with food, workouts, regimen and every month I discover something new and better recognize my body.  Do not stop finding a good solution.  Everything can be improved. <br><br>  <u>What for?</u> <br><br>  Experiments are movement, openness to new things and self-knowledge.  Experiments with coffee helped me to identify the required dose and time of consumption, which will allow you to sleep for 6 hours a day and work productively.  Having tried various products, I know how to increase the energy level without harm to the figure. <br><br>  <u>How to start</u> <br><br>  Change the time of waking up or going to bed.  Transfer training for the morning or evening.  Remove or add some foods from your diet. <br><br>  <u>Important</u> <br>  - Follow the state of health, physical fitness and tone.  Focus on these indicators.  I add new products and see how they affect my shape and tone.  Due to this, I find the best products for each time of day. <br><br><h3>  Communication skills </h3><br>  Yesterday I met a famous actor, a week ago with the writer Dan Waldshmidt, six months ago with Igor Mann.  Each conference, a read book or an interesting article is a reason to make acquaintance. <br><br>  <u>What for?</u> <br><br>  I am familiar with the employees of the largest Russian publishing houses, art directors of leading IT companies, writers, and just interesting people.  Thanks to this, I can get an authoritative answer to the question of interest within a few minutes.  In addition, the higher your social circle, the better you become. <br><br>  <u>How to start</u> <br><br>  Like the book?  Find the author's contacts and contact him.  It will take no more than 15 minutes.  Listened to an interesting speaker?  Come and ask a question.  Find interesting people on the Internet.  Now it is very easy and fast. <br><br>  <u>Important</u> <br>  - Do not get the person.  Contact only in the case and with an interesting question. <br>  - Be open to any communication.  It does not matter that the waiter or a famous writer. <br><br><h3>  Reading </h3><br>  A year and a half ago, I conducted a study.  Every idea that came to mind was recorded with the lesson during which it appeared.  With a three-fold margin, reading has become the most productive way to get ideas. <br><br>  <u>Why read</u> <br><br>  New ideas, the ability to distract, concentrate, gain new skills, gain motivation ... <br><br>  <u>How to start</u> <br><br>  Find the three most popular books in your industry and read them.  Read on the book a week.  It is not difficult.  Imagine that in each book you will find at least one idea.  As a result, you get 52 ideas for the year.  One of them can dramatically change your life. <br><br>  Find out your favorite books of interesting people and make a list to read. <br><br>  <u>Important</u> <br>  - Do not aim for quantity.  A year and a half ago, I accepted the challenge and read 50 books in six months.  The experiment is interesting, but I reread some of the books again. <br>  - Make notes.  Most of the time I read in iBooks.  From there it is easy to export notes to mail.  After reading, I process them and enter them into the knowledge base. <br>  - Implement ideas! <br><br><h3>  Useful books </h3><br>  <u>Productivity</u> <br>  How to put things in order.  The Art of Stress-Free Productivity - David Allen <br>  How to work four hours a week - Timothy Ferris <br><br>  <u>Speech and Negotiation</u> <br>  Turn on the charm by the method of special services - Jack Schafer, Marvin Carlins <br>  Argue this!

So I fixed the habit and it worked.  You can take my method, or use the already mentioned <a href="https://smartprogress.do/"><b>SmartProgress</b></a> service. <br><br>  You will not wake up successful in one morning.  The habit of becoming a part of your life at the moment when you forget about its existence.  And it takes time. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/311516/">https://habr.com/ru/post/311516/</a></p>
