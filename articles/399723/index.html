  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Great features in a compact package, or Video Bridge from Dadzhet</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> For a long time they were not going to the house by a large company: either there was no reason, or just a mood that did not work out this autumn.  But recently, relatives arrived - an excellent occasion for gatherings: the whole family gathered at a large table, sat down, drank vodka, recalled the past.  Naturally, it was not without viewing photos and home vidos.  Recently photos I print rarely. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5ff/9d6/2eb/5ff9d62eb9204b5e8a8947b4473eae2d.jpg"><br><br>  First of all, there are a lot of good photos in the phone, everything is expensive to print, and there‚Äôs no need for anything.  Secondly, I simply do not have time to select what can be printed.  Thirdly, it is much easier to show a photo on a smartphone screen than to carry a photo album with you (and even if you don‚Äôt have to wear it, where to store such a bunch of photo albums at home?). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  When sat down for pictures, it was natural to watch everyone at once was uncomfortable.  Here, relatives and surprised.  They brought with them an excellent thing called a video bridge.  Of course, I saw different sticks and chrome cages, but I never showed any interest in these devices.

      The thing really turned out to be cool.  I liked it very much.  It looks like a flash card or USB modem, but it is not connected to the USB connector, but to HDMI without any adapters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a30/e14/79a/a30e1479a6354965b79b858299e208f3.jpg"><br><br>  On the one hand, we have an HDMI plug with which we connect the video bridge to a free port on the TV. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e1d/36c/32a/e1d36c32a86d481cb5609f6fe5579692.jpg"><br><br>  On one side there is a connector for powering the device, and on the other is an antenna that can be easily lowered and raised.  I did not notice any changes from the position of the antenna. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/947/1e4/bd0/9471e4bd010f4e4d88ba185489492a0a.jpg"><br><br>  There are very small ventilation holes on the inside and outside of the Video Bridge. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c16/ca1/3ae/c16ca13aec5843e68f530cbdc8dd1957.jpg"><br><br>  For power you will need to connect and USB-cable.  We connected to the TV and synced the iPhone with the new device and calmly watched all the pictures on the big screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bea/efa/97a/beaefa97aba048d092fc7b3595c098c4.jpg"><br><br>  In fact, everything that is displayed on the smartphone screen is displayed: you can watch videos and play games.  In general, we spent several hours with a video bridge.  I liked everything, especially my nephew, so I decided to look for this ‚Äúmiracle‚Äù on sale.  I found it from Dadzhet and took a friend to the test to know for sure if it‚Äôs the right thing, or just play for a week. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fef/2a9/46b/fef2a946bab74dbeb3084675596a109c.jpg"><br><br>  The video link is packaged in a small white branded box.  It is informative and visually neutral.  Brief technical information is sufficient so that you can become familiar with the capabilities of the device.  In addition to the device itself, there is a USB cable included in the manual. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bf7/23a/22a/bf723a22ae0b49df96849cd5d1338568.jpg"><br><br>  <b>What's inside</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d80/6be/f14/d806bef14b8e4998911ddd2bd07de981.jpg"><br><br>  Open the two halves of the plastic case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/454/aa8/218/454aa8218ff8426686582b295fa9453f.jpg"><br><br>  The multilayer PCB contains a Toshiba chip, also Samsung, Realtek and a strapping. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/605/fa6/0b8/605fa60b8d8f4f74abbc6b21664e4f1e.jpg"><br><br>  The installation was done with sufficient quality, without blots. <br><br>  <b>The main plus</b> <br><br>  This is an opportunity to work with a huge number of devices and operating systems.  The same "Mirakast" works only with Android, and Video Bridge with similar technology supports synchronization with iOS, Mac, Windows and most popular standards for the transmission of multimedia signals, namely: AirPlay, Miracast, DLNA. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/70f/47b/f42/70f47bf42e724a3b8c6ad3e8381f4b8c.jpg"><br><br>  To work with the video bridge, you must install the application in advance.  The device works through a Wi-Fi network. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fa1/0e0/cb5/fa10e0cb57494236ac059d4f9bfcc24a.jpg"><br><br>  After completing all the necessary settings, we connect to the desired network from an iPhone or any other device, and everything can work.  Next, go to the application and select the desired mode.  Through the video bridge, you can view files from your phone, use TV speakers as a sound source, and also broadcast presentations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dd9/60f/b7e/dd960fb7eb4b47ba993d359ebeb8e629.jpg"><br><br>  You can watch YouTube without any problems (even from an application or a browser from a phone, even from a computer).  AirPay without brakes works with both the iPhone and Mac.  To test with Windows and Android was not possible. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f17/418/07d/f1741807da864fae97366da6d6622d5c.jpg"><br><br>  When I first began to play stored files, photos and videos, then this nostalgia swept over.  I reviewed photos taken on trips and meetings with friends.  Photos are transmitted in excellent quality, as, indeed, and video. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/51b/47f/6da/51b47f6dac4d4eba8e7dc6e97a90b255.jpg"><br><br>  The second option, when the TV is used as speakers, that is, in fact acts as an amplifier.  In this case, there is no picture on the TV screen.  I think that such an interesting feature will be primarily lovers of mobile games or music.  The sound is much louder than from the phone, which is logical, but I didn‚Äôt like the mode itself, I‚Äôm unlikely to use it often. <br><br>  The presentation is more suitable for businessmen.  I started this mode only a couple of times.  Slides are displayed clearly and brightly, it may come in handy someday, or maybe not, but the fact that this function is already good.  In addition, you can go on the Internet and broadcast the browser window, listen to music and radio using a TV and use the camera.  Another video bridge allows you to open files from various cloud storages and watch videos online.  To do this, you need to connect to a network with Internet access. <br><br>  Settings and modes are easy to choose, no need to be a genius.  All settings are made using a smartphone or tablet.  This video bridge is much more interesting than analogs.  Formats ‚Äúknows‚Äù very much, and the price is pleasant. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f2b/c5a/b81/f2bc5ab81706418f812977b519d96fc7.jpg"><br><br>  It is a lot of settings, and that all to try it is necessary to spend a little time.  But if someone comes across this for the first time, then there will be no problems, because everything is written in an accessible language in the operating instructions, even a junior school student and a pensioner will understand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/533/90d/02a/53390d02aff54579bd5d8ec4c057badf.jpg"><br><br>  I tried this device a week and decided to buy myself.  Now I carry with me, I have repeatedly looked at photos from friends.  Video bridge is compact, in a bag or in a pocket does not interfere. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tNsR7_NpFKo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Now you can more often write a video and watch it on the big screen.  Fortunately, the camera in the iPhone is good, even the TV does not always pull, you will probably have to change it to a new one, maybe someone will want to donate a new TV in order to use the device completely. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/edb/f75/429/edbf7542970943e5b7f4e0b97dbc7530.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Well, a brief conclusion</b> <br>  Video bridge is a simple device for those who want to watch video 570 - 720 lines, as well as photos from a smartphone, listen to music from a TV.  I did not dwell on the hardware characteristics.  The main thing is that the device works as stated and performs all the functions assigned to it. <br><br>  <b>Who exactly is not suitable</b> <br>  Owners of Full HD and 4K TVs can say that at high resolutions and powerful video streams the device will slow down.  It is not for that.  Please take this into account. <br><br>  <b>Want to buy?</b> <br>  And if you write the word GEEKT-VM as a promotional code, you can purchase Video Bridge with a 10% discount <a href="https://dadget.ru/katalog/multimedia/videomost/%3Futm_referrer%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_term%3Dvideomost%26utm_content%3Dvideomost%26utm_campaign%3Dvideomost_403">on the</a> Dadget <a href="https://dadget.ru/katalog/multimedia/videomost/%3Futm_referrer%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_term%3Dvideomost%26utm_content%3Dvideomost%26utm_campaign%3Dvideomost_403">page</a> .
