  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The crisis of the genre</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, there has been an acute shortage of competent specialists in the Russian Internet.  In large companies, there is a clear lack of adequate human resources.  Yes, programmers (or rather, for the most part, coders) still lack high qualifications in Runet, but a little bit of a difficult task or project with high loads, and it becomes difficult to find performers.  The level is not the same. <br><br>  It turns out that the influx of new high-quality personnel into the industry is gradually decreasing. <br>  And there is more and more migration of personnel: <br>  Rambler ‚Üí RBC <br>  Mail ‚Üí Yandex and so on. <br>  Such a migration only leads to an increase in the salaries of web developers. <br>  After all, an additional $ 100-200 per month will not make the weather, and you need to poach with more substantial offers. <br>  And this is where the problem arises - good specialists are dragging the market up, and people are rushing to it, who, for their meager knowledge, want to get quite large sums. <br><br>  A fresh example on Habr√© is a vacancy from A &amp; P for 60‚Äì90 thousand a month <b>for two years of experience</b> .  What can you learn in two years?

      For me it is a mystery why there are no new specialists. <br>  It would seem that nowadays those who in the early to mid-90s faced computers in schools and then at home are graduating from universities.  In theory, the general level of computer literacy is growing ... If I‚Äôve seen a computer at 12 only at my father‚Äôs work on major holidays (because of access control), then today's youth at 12‚Äì15 years old already have a lot of experience with computers.  But, apparently, just as with an entertainment tool.  It's a pity. <br><br>  Without an influx of new personnel, the industry will become less investment-attractive - all the resources on the account, for new projects they are not.  Or there is, but for big money. <br><br>  In a good way, it would be necessary to develop a system of personnel training - to organize advanced training courses in which to talk about problem-solving techniques, design scalable systems, conduct seminars, give lectures in universities, and so on.  Well, the school would also be affected.  Let it be optional, even from simple things, but you can start preparing future personnel right from the upper grades of schools.  Yes, this is not a lesson for an informatics teacher, but why not share the experience with those who already have it?  Yes, the process is too long - from school grade 8 to work for at least 5-7 years, but you can.  And people who get 2-3 years of independent experience before work are better than those who do not get such experience at all. <br><br>  So I think about gradually systematizing my knowledge, writing a training course and trying to read it in some local school or in the first courses of some university ... Only more such people would like ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/3782/">https://habr.com/ru/post/3782/</a></p>
