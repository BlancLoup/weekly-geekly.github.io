First, this application will be tested in the United States at the Coppell Independent School District (ISD).  The authors of the project claim that the application will provide teachers with the opportunity to take their work to a new level, allowing them to conduct training with an individual approach. <br><br>  ISD is one of the most successful school districts in Texas.  It includes several settlements with a total of 1,200 students and 750 teachers.  The need for good teachers is becoming increasingly significant in all countries of the world.  In the US, for example, about a third of students need extra classes with tutors after they finish school and go to college.  The quality of education received at school is not too high.  One can argue about the reasons for this state of affairs, but we need to correct the situation now. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And the facts speak for themselves.  Thus, the level of student achievement in the United States is now below the required national level.  Accordingly, the needs of enterprises for qualified employees are only partially met.  Watson Element will help students learn more effectively, and teachers - to find and find an individual approach to their wards.

      ‚ÄúFor decades, IBM has provided its resources and the opportunity to improve the education and training system for children and adolescents, our future leaders,‚Äù said Harriet Green, head of commerce and education at IBM Watson IoT, ‚ÄúIBM and Apple launch Watson Element to help teachers improve the quality of student learning, taking into account their preferences and interests. ‚Äù  This, according to Harriet Green, can help shape an individual approach to the training of specific students and pupils. <br><br>  Teachers will be able to track the progress of their students, as well as quickly understand what the student is interested in.  IBM Watson Element helps you keep track of each student‚Äôs achievements and plans.  In addition, the teacher will be able to enter notes if one of the students goes to a football match from his school, someone wants to become a politician and participates in school debates, and someone else has received an excellent mark for his scientific project in chemistry . <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WV3xuGXeYN4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  One of the functions in IBM Watson Element allows the teacher to get the results of the analysis of the preferences and hobbies of the student.  Also, the service will help monitor the progress of each student.  If necessary, it will be possible to form interest groups from schoolchildren whose members would be interested in spending time with each other, gaining additional knowledge on the subject of interest. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWorking with IBM and Apple, we are developing original solutions to improve the quality of education with regard to student interests, and we can also use the information we receive about the sensitivity of each student,‚Äù said Marily Denison, a representative from the ISD school district in Texas. <br><br>  Watson Enlight can help plan classes, and the service provides the teacher with instructional materials during the preparation of the next lesson.  For example, if a student has problems with mastering algebra, the teacher will receive additional materials that will help explain the student an incomprehensible term or action.  The service will be able to collect scattered information on a specific topic throughout the Internet, presenting the entire package of collected documents to the teacher. <br><br>  According to the district representative, Watson Enlight is an application that will help rethink the educational process by adding the ability to track students' interests and hobbies. <br><br>  The application is developed in the framework of the <a href="http://www.ibm.com/mobilefirst/">MobileFirst</a> project.  IBM and Apple have already developed dozens of applications for this project.  IBM MobileFirst enterprise mobility solutions contain applications, infrastructure, and communication methods designed specifically for mobile users.  This means that all interactions can be made personalized based on data that is safely processed on the endpoints and provided through a convenient user interface. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/399341/">https://habr.com/ru/post/399341/</a></p>
