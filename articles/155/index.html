  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"Phenomenon" rpod.ru</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The word "phenomenon" I deliberately take in quotes.  Not by malice, but by confusion.  Imagine there is a <a href="http://rpod.ru/">website, there is a community</a> .  People there are not engaged in fashionable business in Russia yet - podcasting, but this is not the case at all.  The community, as it is supposed to be a party of about 500 people, has its own honest, army laws.  There is a sergeant - Vasily, an amazing person in charisma and professionalism.  There are grandfathers, "old" podcasters, who are on the site from the very beginning.  And there are young people, tusnyak, who comes to the site and podcasting to chat and chat.  Everything seems to be good, the ecosystem is not closed, the number of people is constantly growing.  But here the creators of the site, which until then had been as simple as three rubles, are under the cloak of the reins.  And a brand new, web2.0 version of the engine is born. <br><br>  And now the result: <br>  * half of the grandfathers makes a sharp movement of the head and lubricates the skis in the direction of English-speaking hosts and sites.  We already have a settled audience, our regular listeners and this ayaks with vebdvanolom we have not rested. <br>  * the second half continues its business on the site, but <i>dramatically</i> reduces activity.  I do not want hasty conclusions, but it seems that some of the "grandfathers" simply could not figure out the new site.  What is also clear, we are all human. <br>  * Our younger generation, young people and teenagers, also did not really understand the charm of all innovations, the concept of tags and content separation for them an empty sound.  But the feeling of movement on the site led to the revitalization of those who do not really like to write.  Ie a lot of new podcasts, but most often this is the first and only podcast by this author.  Which of course affected the quality of the content, unfortunately not in the best direction. <br><br>  And how I love - morality: if a small change in the engine is done <i>only</i> for the purpose of changing the engine - do not do it.  If a change in the engine leads to a drastic change in service, never do it.  The power of web2.0, whatever we put into this concept, above all not in technology, but in people.  And the most valuable of the people are content producers, because it is for their web sites that visitors come to the site.  Of all the visitors, the most valuable are those that come to the site regularly, because the regular reader not only reads himself, but also shows them to friends.  Of all the friends, the most valuable are like-minded people, because losing them is the worst of all.

      Of course, it’s not for me to judge, I’m rather a developer, not a manager, but remember the admonition “how things should be wrong, Kolobok said, slowly chewing on Fox.”  Such is the mathematics of Web 2.0, although sometimes it seems that it would be worth writing Web / 2.0. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/155/">https://habr.com/ru/post/155/</a></p>
