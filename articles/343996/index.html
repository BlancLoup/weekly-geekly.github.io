Under it means placing advertising with opinion leaders (vlogerov, bloggers) and in popular public on platforms with different content formats: YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, Twitch, and the like.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  Influencing marketing is a relatively new way of attracting an audience that best of all shows itself at a low return or ‚Äúburning out‚Äù of the usual sources of traffic on CPI or CPA models like myTarget, Facebook or Google. <br><br>  The specificity of promotion through leaders is that they talk about the product (application or game) of the initially loyal audience. <br><br>  This information is more credible, because subscribers tend to rely in their choice on the recommendations of national experts.  Another advantage of marketing influence is that in such a format it is easier for users to reveal complex products with unobvious functions or non-standard mechanics. <br><br>  For example, this is what we know about the statistics on the use of YouTube in Russia: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4f/jk/c1/4fjkc1d0s5yahrmqxccl6utfvk4.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>Sources: HubSpot 2017 open reports and Google 2016</i> <br><br><h2>  Task and budget </h2><br>  <a href="http://smartsearchapp.com/%3Ffrom%3Dzorkacase">Smart Search</a> is a mobile browser that helps you quickly find information in various sources: Yandex, Google, YouTube, Wikipedia, and others.  The application allows you to quickly switch between them to compare the results. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yu/aa/dw/yuaadwkuafdz3kdyazmcpud6rga.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  At first glance, this is an offer with high competition: the market is already divided between major players like Chrome, Yandex Browser and Opera. <br><br>  It was necessary to find a non-standard entry to the audience, which would allow to bring a unique sales proposition of the product, attract as many quality installations with high conversion to the target action as possible and keep within the reasonable CPI rate. <br><br>  Our introduction looked like this: <br><br><ul><li>  Geography - Russia and the CIS </li><li>  Budget - $ 10,355 </li><li>  Platforms - iOS and Android </li><li>  The campaign period is from October 27 to November 3rd. </li></ul><br><h2>  Advertising campaign </h2><br>  From the base of more than a thousand positions, our internal influence marketing department formed a media plan that took into account all the nuances of the task.  It is based on large channels with a large number of video views (over 200 thousand) on specific topics: tops (‚ÄúTop 5 films of 2017‚Äù, ‚ÄúTop 10 best pranks‚Äù and the like), DIY, lifehacks, movies, experiments and equipment. <br><br>  We will not mention the real names of the channels, but we can honestly indicate the cost of accommodation for each vlogera. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/i_/hv/pk/i_hvpkpyrajkf5bcgdzdxim80hi.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  When the advertiser approved the media plan, the main phase of the campaign began: negotiations with opinion leaders, approval of creatives, production control and execution of tasks on time.  The result of these works are the product integration Smart Search. <br><br>  Here are some movie clips from different vlogger. <br><br><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GJZwBezIKYw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>Fragment of the release of Jgeek |</i>  <i>J &amp; greg channel</i> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nmxxmopwDrc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>Fragment release SokoL [off] TV</i> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jmeNUq4HLQA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>Fragment of the release of Andro-news.com</i> <br><br><h2>  Campaign results </h2><br><h3>  Paid traffic </h3><br>  The number of given installations for tracking links: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-m/hu/gc/-mhugcfiu0k7rbvuz3kqdn5phe4.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  For each Android user who installed the application, there were nine key events (in our case, the search request).  According to the advertiser, for an audience drawn from AdWords, this figure is five.  Each new iOS user averaged 6.57 searches. <br><br>  The percentage of loyal users who logged into the mobile application more than three times was 66.7% and 49.4% on Android and iOS, respectively. <br><br><h3>  Organic traffic </h3><br>  Analysis of incoming traffic during campaigns on influencer marketing is hampered by the fact that some installations pass by tracking links posted under YouTube videos.  They unpredictably mingle with the rest of the organic. <br><br>  To level this factor, we considered the results using a special formula. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ud/-f/86/ud-f86lcnurlbp3eo3if2d8h5ig.png" alt="image"><br><br>  And that's what happened with us: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9p/wn/-e/9pwn-egizjg2kcx9b97x3finv64.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  When calculating the CPI, we summarized the traffic on the tracking links and the traffic that passed by them and got into organic.  By adding the number of organic and inorganic plants and considering the final CPI rate, we obtained the following results: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/om/et/xa/ometxanoophl3w7p844259ida2a.png" alt="image"><br><h3>  Additional data </h3><br>  The user return rate on Android was an impressive 50.90% for the first day and 22% for the seventh, while the iOS metrics were about the same. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kl/4w/p6/kl4wp6jqucdvcowvbmda1xqusku.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>The rate of return of Android users to the application, 1-7 days, AppMetrica</i> <br><br>  On the day of the launch of the advertising campaign (October 27), the application was at the 66th position among those free in the Communication category on Google Play.  As we see, in two days it rose to the 15th place.  There was an additional influx of organic matter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0v/tb/xj/0vtbxjiof4f64bn5r7oxe8gcgww.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Application positions in the Google Play Market in the period from 10.22 to 11.11</i> <br><br>  In the App Store, the application has risen from the 24th position to the fourth among those free in the Reference category. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/p8/pd/2v/p8pd2vyx_cbo8tay1jfy5sj5iyq.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Application positions in the App Store in the period from 10.22 to 11.11</i> <br><br><h2>  What we learned </h2><br>  Despite the trend to automate the purchase of placements from the opinion leaders, not all tasks can be solved through the purchasing platform.  Finding an effective balance between dispersing the budget for small opinion leaders and purchasing publications from a couple of ‚Äústars‚Äù is not an easy task that requires a professional approach. <br><br>  Many vlogery, looking at more successful colleagues, begin to behave like full-fledged media with the appropriate price.  The most effective way in this situation is to find a niche of popular opinion leaders with an optimal amount of views and not spoiled by frequent integrations with advertisers. <br><br>  If you are looking for a fresh source of quality traffic for mobile platforms - these are opinion leaders.  They lead a motivated, loyal audience with an understanding of what and why you need your product. <br><br>  The reverse side of the coin: quite a lot of resources are spent on selection and communication with opinion leaders.  And without the experience of placement you can easily drop even $ 50 thousand with a mediocre result. <br><br>  Influencer marketing is not a panacea, but a balanced advertising campaign with a correct understanding of the product and its audience can bring unexpectedly high results. <br><cut></cut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/343996/">https://habr.com/ru/post/343996/</a></p>
