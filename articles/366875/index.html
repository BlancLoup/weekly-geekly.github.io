    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7f3/82e/2f7/7f382e2f734343c881be2fa47a1a9adc.png"><br><br>  The Sonochromatic Music Scale or logarithmic scale was first introduced in 2003 and allows you to distinguish visible colors from the color wheel. <br><br>  The Pure Sonochromatic Scale (2005) is a linear scale that allows you to ‚Äúhear‚Äù colors that are invisible to the human eye, such as infrared or ultraviolet. <br><br>  The first prototype of Eyeborg was created in 2003, then expanded by the dependence of the volume of the sound on the brightness of the color.  The neuroimplant was finally osteointegrated into the occipital bone in 2013 by a doctor, who remained anonymous, due to the ban on such operations by the Committee on Neuroethics. <br>  At this point, the author will allow himself to express a subjective condemnation of this discipline, which in my opinion rather strongly inhibits the development of cyborgization. <br><br><h4>  Activity </h4><br>  He actively advocates for the rights of cyborg, the creator of the <a href="http://www.cyborgfoundation.com/">Cyborg Foundation</a> , where he is fighting for the opportunity to consider extended parts as part of the human body. <br><br>  In 2004, when the photo with the antenna was not accepted for passport documents, Neil began to write letters to the passport office, claiming that the antenna was his ‚Äúnew authority‚Äù.  He was supported by the attending physician, friends and colleagues, and after several weeks of correspondence, the photo was taken. <br><br>  I highly recommend watching his performance on TedTalks <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/neil_harbisson_i_listen_to_color">‚ÄúI listen to color‚Äù</a> .  Russian subtitles are available. <br><br><h4>  Cyborg scientist </h4><br>  Kevin Warrick, probably known to many here, was born on February 9, 1954, professor, author of a large number of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref%3Ddp_byline_sr_book_1%3Fie%3DUTF8%26field-author%3DKevin%2BWarwick%26search-alias%3Dbooks-uk%26text%3DKevin%2BWarwick%26sort%3Drelevancerank">books on cybernetics and artificial intelligence</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2bb/b8a/eb3/2bbb8aeb3e744905be0575c88671a7a6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  What is implanted </h4><br>  Warwick made the first improvement of his body back in 1998, which allows him to be considered one of the first cyborgs.  Then he was implanted with a transponder (RFID tag) in the forearm.  Chip allowed the computer to track Warrick's movement in the cybernetics department ‚Äî a computer, for example, welcomed the scientist in the mornings when he came to work.  The same professor could control the doors, lights, heaters "without raising a finger." <br><br>  The second stage of the Cyborg 2.0 experiment began in 2002.  Its main goal was to achieve feedback with the implanted device.  In March, an <a href="http://www.kevinwarwick.com/the_neural_interface.htm">array of one hundred electrodes</a> was implanted in the median nerve, the incision was made just below the fold of the left arm, the whole operation lasted just over two hours.  As a result of the experiment, Warrick was able to control a specially created robotic arm and receive feedback using stimulation of nerve fibers in his hand with an implant.  This bidirectional functionality was later demonstrated with the help of Kevin's wife, Irena, who also underwent a similar operation with a slightly simplified implant ‚Äî he could sense when someone touched his wife's arm. <br>  One of the important aspects of Kevin's work was monitoring the condition of the hand after implantation of the electrodes - it was feared that direct interaction with the nervous system could cause damage or decrease in the performance of the hand.  But the assumption was not confirmed. <br><br><h4>  Activity </h4><br>  Warrick is also known as a judge and organizer of competitions for passing the Turing Test, he was also one of the people who considered <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2596%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%258F_%25D0%2593%25D1%2583%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD">Zhenya Gustman</a> , who convinced a third of the judges in his ‚Äúhumanity‚Äù who passed the Turing test;  He is a consultant and researcher for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_brain_stimulation">deep brain stimulation</a> project used to control and suppress the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.  At the University of Reading, a professor led a team dealing with neuroethics and the dilemmas associated with it, since many of his experiments are questionable from the point of view of modern bioethics. <br><br><h4>  Cyborg-DIY </h4><br>  <i>‚ÄúI don't want to go to space in a spaceship.</i>  <i>I want to be a spaceship</i> <br>  Tim Kennon - programmer, entrepreneur, biohacker - born September 11, 1979.  He started his modifications with a more traditional piercing, and then decided that there was no point in exchanging small things. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7a1/a9f/298/7a1a9f2988e946748db4cc1785e5fbb3.jpg"><br><br><h4>  What is implanted </h4><br>  Circadia is a rather limited embedded analogue of fitness bracelets.  Able to record body indicators and transfer them via bluetooth to Android smartphone.  LEDs are also built into it, which can highlight the Cannon tattoo. <br>  By the way, the device is positioned as open-source, <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bf3/fcc/2e6/bf3fcc2e6f9f445694f92abf37bd8d9f.jpg"><br>  Thermosensor, pulse meter (data diverge, whether it was included in 1.0), LEDs <br><br>  Since no certified surgeon would have agreed to such an operation, Tim turned for help to a tattoo parlor found with the help of participants in a conference on body modification. <br>  ‚ÄúThe procedure took about 10 minutes, it took about 10 stitches, ice was used as a balancing agent‚Äù - in any case, this is stated in many interviews. <br>  At this point, the author again allows himself to recall the notorious bioethics, which provokes the spread of such basement operations, which are more likely to receive various complications. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Not the most accurate implantation, because, just in case, under the spoiler</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/034/0c3/636/0340c3636fae4e7089b969aff4042270.jpg"><br></div></div><br><br>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D_R3hxcgvOTw">Video of</a> the charging process, if anyone is interested. <br><br><h4>  Activity </h4><br>  <a href="http://grindhousewetware.com/">Grindhouse Wetware,</a> founded in 2012, is working on projects such as a hat that generates low voltage current to stimulate the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for memory and concentration;  sonar gloves that capture ultraviolet rays, Wi-FI signal, which could help blind people to move using echolocation. <br>  The ‚Äúoffice‚Äù of Greenhouse, located in the basement, fully corresponds to the name - concrete walls, wooden beams, dim light and a washing machine with a load of dirty linen, standing in the corner. <br>  Kennon himself calls his laboratory "half a cyberpunk scientific dungeon, half electronic and biological experimental center." <br>  At the moment, as far as I know, Circadia 1.0 is extracted from the body of Kennon, the experiment was considered successful.  The next version should be able to measure the pulse, pressure, blood sugar, and be smaller. <br><br>  And finally. <br><br>  If, after reading this publication, you suddenly become imbued with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãimplanting foreign devices into your own body, but you do not have friends of brilliant surgeons, cybernetics professors or other people who are ready to help you, then for example, such a whale exists for you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2f3/897/a51/2f3897a51ee14d75a74c59513a92f693.png"><br><br>  Which can be purchased here: <a href="https://dangerousthings.com/gear/">dangerousthings.com/gear</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/366875/">https://habr.com/ru/post/366875/</a></p>
