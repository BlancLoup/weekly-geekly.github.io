  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Microsoft will have to make changes to the operating system Vista</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A few days ago, <a href="http://feache.habrahabr.ru/">Feache</a> published a note <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/blog/google/17315.html">on a monopoly case against Google, which was instigated by Google against Microsoft</a> . <br>  Lawyers involved in the process yesterday reported that Microsoft agreed to make changes to the Vista operating system. <br>  State prosecutors, the US Department of Justice and Microsoft have reached an agreement that allows you to avoid further litigation over Google‚Äôs complaint. <br>  Google claims that Vista is deliberately designed to slow down the process of searching for files on your hard disk when using search systems other than Microsoft‚Äôs built-in search system. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Google filed this complaint confidentially in accordance with the Microsoft anti-competitive behavior monitoring procedure established five years ago. <br>  The federal government and the states plan in the near future to submit a joint report, on the content of which an agreement in principle has been reached.  Some differences of opinion remain on the wording.  This report should list the changes Microsoft is required to make to the Vista software.  The differences are due to the different positions held by the Ministry of Justice, which supported Microsoft, and by some states that vigorously supported Google and insisted on tougher measures. <br>  According to the lawyers involved in the process, the changes made in Vista will allow users to decide which program to search for files on the computer to use, and the choice to search for programs from other manufacturers will not slow down the computer, as is happening now.  Microsoft will also inform computer users how they can change the default search application.  But the agreement does not include all the changes that were originally included in the requirements of Google. <br>  Google claims that the work of its file search program, which can be downloaded and installed for free, is slowing down due to the internal design of a similar program included in Vista.  In this case, Google and Microsoft programs will be indexed in parallel, which significantly slows down the computer.  Therefore, Google accuses Microsoft of violating the antitrust agreement of 2002, which directly prohibits Microsoft from designing the operating system in such a way as to restrict the freedom of choice of users. <br>  Microsoft claims that Vista has been carefully designed to meet the requirements of this agreement, and that many of the changes that Google is talking about have already been made.  Microsoft lawyer Bradford L. Smith said that Vista was thoroughly tested for compatibility with other companies' software, and that a special independent committee of experts spent years testing Vista for potential violations of antitrust laws before it was released for sale. <br>  PS Note  trans.  The translation is abbreviated; a detailed explanation of the relationship between the different US legal structures and their position in this dispute is omitted.  All this can be read in the original article. </div>
