  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The story of how life was born on the gift of the gift, or the significance of the advanced communities of Runet and their inhabitants</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On September 22, 2008, we launched the <a href="http://darudar.org/">darudar.org</a> project, a website through which people donate their belongings, their capabilities and their time, free of charge, free of charge, without requiring anything in return.  And after exactly 10 days, we became involuntary witnesses to a spontaneous and unexpected experiment that unfolded right on our website and told us something about the advanced communities of the RuNet and their inhabitants. <br><br>  The site was at that moment in closed alpha testing; only those who received the invitation and registered could see it.  Invitations were distributed very carefully - only friends and close acquaintances.  And here, after only 10 days from the date of birth of the site, completely different people begin to publicly distribute invites to Daru ~ a gift - almost simultaneously in three major social networks. <br><br>  September 30 - at <a title="lepra.ru" href="http://leprosorium.ru/comments/440310">lepra.ru</a> , October 1 - at <a title="habr.ru" href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/invites/41358/">habr.ru</a> , and October 2 - at <a title="dirty.ru" href="http://dirty.ru/comments/241062">dirty.ru</a> .  The message text is about the same: a brief description of the resource and a proposal to give your invites to all those interested.  The users of the three aforementioned communities found themselves in exactly the same situation: there is practically no information about the gift, you can‚Äôt look at the site without registering. <a name="habracut"></a>

      And here, google analitics gives the following pictures. <br><br><h3>  Number of visits </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a0/844/816/3a084481605379fb9001e7ab7a6a6cf0.gif" alt="stat_1.gif"><br>  Here you can see the dynamics of visits from the three above-mentioned sites in the 10-day period after the distribution of invites.  The splash at the very end is so cleverly displayed the accumulated sum of visits for each of the resources.  In numbers, this amount looks like this: <br><ul><li>  lepra.ru - 914 visits </li><li>  habr.ru - 2442 </li><li>  dirty.ru - 2792 </li></ul><br><h3>  Quality of visits </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/edc/116/ff6/edc116ff62b650e669b0d3a7a56dc88c.gif" alt="stat.gif"><br>  The first three columns: pages to visit;  time spent on the site;  The failure rate is just slightly modified data from Google analytics.  The number of registrations from sites is a hypothetical speculative calculation.  I proceeded from the fact that it is proportional to the number of "remaining on the site" and simply multiplied the total number of visits by the percentage of "remaining" (for leprosy it will be 914 * 6/10). <br><br><h3>  Observation results </h3><br>  It is interesting to see how different the audience of the three sites is.  Lepryan (a closed resource with its own unique ethics) is very loyal to the new resource recommended by him, Habra people (news thematic resource) also carefully consider a new project heard, but dert people look (entertaining and educational resource) and immediately leave. <br><br>  Lepra does not act instantly and does not have a very large audience, but keeps the interest for the new longer.  Durty gives the most massive user visits, but it works for only one day and shows little interest.  But Habr is somewhere in between: a lot of visits on the first day of the news, but the interest is much more stable than the pull. <br><br>  Daru ~ daru managed to survive simultaneously in three-dimensional lepro-habro-derti effect.  For three days of distribution of invitations, the number of visits was 12,000 (On the day of maximum load, 5,000).  During this time, about 1,000 people registered on a completely closed and not ready site.  Since then, the fate of Dara ~ Dara has changed dramatically: the time of friendly testing has ended, strangers came to each other and just started living here.  So life was born on the gift of gift. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/45108/">https://habr.com/ru/post/45108/</a></p>
