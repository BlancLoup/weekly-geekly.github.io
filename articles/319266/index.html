I went on about the readers and still changed the order of the chapters.  So all fans of UnityScript will have to wait a little longer. <br><br>  And by the way, how does this photo relate to the Dark Forester? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7b0/8a4/490/7b08a449005fa5c0c5225e841737ad2a.png" alt="image">

      <br>
      So, let's go further. <br><br>  Woe to the developer found himself at the parents with his wife and child, in the same room at thirty-plus years, not living, with his parents with 18.  The main computer is broken, the Unity engine is expired, a lot of debt and unemployment. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Went a series of interviews.  Maybe it was time to leave the dry world of Java and these stupid banking applications and try to find a job on Unity3d!  My thoughts were slipping, but I still applied for work in all possible offices. <br><br>  Dark Forester on the incentive played a role.  Applications for work on Unity3d were answered within a few hours.  As you understand, the usual applications for work had to wait at least several days, or even several weeks. <br><br>  The first offer was in Leiptsyg, a young start-up with a good team of 50 people made games for small children.  Well, this is not Blizzard, not Nival, but at least Unity3d. <br><br>  Six hours by train and negotiation.  Everything is going fine, they are ready to take me, but it comes to salary, to my request, quite simple by the standards of Bavaria, they tell me that even the creators of the start-ups do not receive such money.  As a result, I have to refuse myself. <br><br>  Then there are several more offers from the same former GDR, but the salaries are even lower there and I understand that Unity3d does not have close wages like for Java Developer.  I get one refusal from Ubisoft D√ºsseldorf and I‚Äôm probably the most miserable telephone interview in my life with Gameforge from Karlsruhe.  Have you ever passed it with five developers around the conference?  ‚ÄúHere I am after the occasion if I ever had the chance to hang up.‚Äù <br><br>  And in Ubisoft, and Gameforge, programmers with knowledge of C # were required, and not Unity3d and UnityScript - I did not have this knowledge. <br><br><h3>  All under the same sky </h3><br>  As I said, there was a parallel search for a job in Java.  I will not go into much detail as a result of the rumors diverge quickly, Dark Forester helped me more than once and the first 10 minutes of the interview were talking about him, for the first time I really felt that almost two and a half years of development were lost not for nothing - I made an investment for life  But I was not hired because of the Dark Forester. <br><br>  People with whom I worked on the former job advised me to their employers.  As a result, I was invited to two companies and what was my surprise already in the telephone conversation to find out what they know about me from somewhere.  In the end, both there and there they offered me a normal salary, much more than in the previous office.  One company was located in Dresden, and the other in Munich - the choice was obvious. <br><br><h3>  What not kill you makes you stronger </h3><br>  A month passes, the first money finally comes from work, as the lifestyle of recent years makes itself felt again.  I spend an absolutely normal working day, I just want to get up ... <br><br>  But 16 o'clock seats per day knock on my door!  Feeling that my legs were detached from my back, the next morning I can crawl to the toilet with a bum.  Diagnosis - pinching hernia of two vertebral discs.  I drop out of work for three weeks, and in the first six months I can be fired without giving a reason within two weeks. <br><br>  They don't fire me from work, but it's time to return with a new force to the sport.  If the last two years I got up at five in the morning and went to work, now I got up at five in the morning and went to the gym, spending three hours there. <br><br><h3>  Court for the right to work on the game </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/faa/614/321/faa6143213d8e35f268fd511a9f7c104.png" alt="image"><br><br>  At the very beginning, when all this porridge was brewed, I called Russian lawyers a couple of times to consult.  But, I was immediately told, you should not have quit, if you were fired, then we would have won this case, and so useless. <br><br>  To be honest, I was still sure that I would win the case, if the court in a ‚Äúdemocratic‚Äù country works, as I used to in the Hollywood films, then I had to decompose them with the usual logic.  The other side wrote absolutely wild accusations against me, but the whole joke was that they wrote about a topic in which they were not at all in the topic. <br><br>  As a result, my accusations reached twenty pages of German scribbling and all I needed to win was only the logical thinking of a programmer. <br><br>  What were the 4 points on which I accused the former employer? <br><br>  Point one: Climbing into private life, the court should have annulled the Abmahnung. <br><br>  Point two: The court was to annul ‚ÄúErmahnung‚Äù, where the professional honor of the developer was affected.  In the accusation, I used the word ‚Äúmadness‚Äù several times - comparing a couple of responses on the forum to a stim, lying on the bed with a laptop, with the ability to work a full day at the office during pneumonia was just wild. <br><br>  Point three: I had to write a paper in which the real state of things would stand, how I worked in the company and what I did.  And I note that I wrote several times, not excellent paper, but exactly what I actually did.  The paper was detained by me at that time for more than three months. <br><br>  The fourth point, which is eventually canceled, but still my former employer will be forced to pay: This is to pay me compensation for my dismissal from work.  About 15.000 euros. <br><br>  I was in Germany, so what should I do to win the first point?  Yes, just to put pressure on the word ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù, if, after shouting a word ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù a couple of times, you can bombard someone, you won‚Äôt be able to win anything that‚Äôs legal in your free time. <br><br>  Point two was even easier.  I had a conclusion from the doctor, well, and most importantly, pictures of the second and fifth weeks that showed pneumonia. <br><br>  There were two hearings, the first and second.  At the first hearing, we were invited to go to a peaceful and simply hush up case.  At first I, and then the accused side refused.  But, I still won one point automatically - point three.  I asked the court how I should look for a job if I wasn‚Äôt written from my former job, what I did and it looks suspicious to future employers.  The paper was sent to me in a week, everything that I did and did not do was in it, which was quite funny. <br><br>  Point four was canceled, according to the law of Germany, if you yourself quit, then there is no point on which I could demand money from a former employer.  But, since I won the court on three points, it was nevertheless my former office that had to fork out for a larger sum for losing the case, because it would be better not to go to court in Germany. <br><br>  Of course, it would be possible to write separate chapters about the court like any other part of this story, but the main thing I legitimized, now no one could tell me that the development of the game in my spare time is prohibited. <br><br>  Yes, I won the trial, but I was prescribed in the contract the right to work on games outside of work even before the end of the trial, but what's the use if I dropped out of the work on the Dark Forester already for a couple of months?  There had to be a way out and it dawned on me, until I had money for the engine and computer repair, I would do what I had to do for a long time, I would start writing a two-dimensional game in C # and I do not need Unity Pro for it.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe game that came to my mind was brilliant, I am still sure that this idea is much cooler than the Dark Forester, and when I finish with it one day, I‚Äôll continue where I‚Äôll find out now.  This idea was born for Habr fans and those who spend days on stackoverflow. <br><br><h3>  Programming war </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/70e/ebd/d67/70eebdd6720b76c54254e2d75950a8ec.png" alt="image"><br><br>  A two-dimensional game in which programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãfight against each other.  No, I did not want to write some kind of logical hard to understand game style.  This was supposed to be an arcade RPG-Action strategy in which not only programming fans could play, but people who are absolutely far from it.  Well, fans of programming would naturally expect surprises at every step. <br><br>  For example, the HTML character had at its disposal 'br' - something like bombs that broke through the bad code down, and 'hr' was ulti, he shot all the code in a line.  The virus had at its disposal bugs, errors, trojans and fatal errors.  And the JS functions didn‚Äôt fight with anyone at all, but modified the battlefield. <br><br>  I quickly came up with such a bunch of things.  Like the Repository, Levels Bosses NullPointerException, InputException, OutputException and OutOfBoundsArrayException. <br>  The game initially had 4 programming languages ‚Äã‚ÄãHTML, CSS, JS and Virus (please do not write in the comments that HTML and CSS are not programming languages), then C # and Java were added. <br><br>  Each character had a satellite, and the virus had a Trojan that could handle one of three types of resources: code, matrix, and functions.  All had skills in the form of familiar syntax.  The game also introduced a couple of factions and character characteristics, so I introduced 5 types of programmers: Dartanyan, Heisenberg, Pinkman, ‚ÄúOld Boy‚Äù and Hughes. <br><br>  Here is an example of Heisenberg: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/deb/0b8/af3/deb0b8af39e913f22affdfaaae47a2a8.png" alt="image"><br><br>  And, of course, the story I made up for the full program (the graphics in the video is outdated): <br>  <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/%3Fid%3D674557243">Greenlight link.</a>  . <br><br>  I introduced a bunch of factions, from pseudo aliens - ‚ÄúAn‚Äù, to Freedomus - I think it is clear to whom a hint ... <br><br>  And finally, in all this, I decided to shove a journalistic investigation, like a puzzle, which gradually reveals the secrets of the factions and how everything that happens in the game really happened.  And without MMO, there is no kind of MMO - all people would play as a matter of fact in a single-player game, but at one gate, apart from the main progress and levels, there would be global advances, each level passed by one person would be summed up and it would be reclaimed IP addresses. <br><br>  As a result, I didn‚Äôt change myself, it was the fourth year without going ‚Äúabroad‚Äù, at sea and on the first vacation, I spent all two weeks programming the day and night of Programming War, I quickly scored on Greenlight and stopped throwing out advances, I had There was complete confidence in the super idea, I changed the models a bit, updated the graphics, added a bunch of functions, and I was also very pleased that, unlike Dark Forester, there were no bugs in the game. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cd7/398/877/cd73988775bc3ea678869d5bdf3c677e.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Of course, as you can see from the pictures, I am clearly not endowed with work in Photoshop, but nevertheless I managed to do many things myself, unfortunately you will not see updated screenshots here, I decided to keep the further development of the game under a veil of secrecy.  So I began to introduce gradually a dark design, like what is now often used in IDE Unity or Intellij. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/07e/d2c/9f5/07ed2c9f50ab3b9943bae91e00a5c2f8.png" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Back to the future </h3><br>  But the time has come to postpone Programming War on the shelf, half a year of work has passed, finally, on the debt for the engine, almost $ 700 was able to pay, buy a new motherboard and processor.  I returned;  during that time, the subscription to Unity has changed, and Unity 5 has already been released. I immediately decided that I needed to transfer the entire project to a new version, since a couple of excellent forest assets appeared in the store.  Unfortunately, I still will not painlessly switch to Unity 5, but I will refuse new assets. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c86/a71/7ad/c86a717ad80d9f2987d3b12f2f244fdd.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Time without development was not in vain.  I had time to analyze, as I mentioned, I had to get back in shape - I began to live and work using the old formula, sports in the first place, until I practice, I don‚Äôt go to work - quality should take so much time as needed  Plus I added cold water to my life, I don‚Äôt even know if I believe in them.  I only know that I get up vigorous and that this is part of a crusade.  Yes, I'm a damn thing, every day I don't want to do this - but in order to finish off the Dark Forester, I have to win myself every day. <br><br>  <b>And a man, a man provides.</b>  <b>And he doesn‚Äôt even when he's not appreciated, or respected, or even loved.</b>  <b>He just bears up and he does it.</b>  <b>Because he's a man.</b> <br><br>  Slow vylaz of debt.  With such a salary, we only went to McDonalds twice a year.  Almost the fifth year of holidays - the fifth year without the sea, just programming.  Slow entry into the form, cold shower, third red bull, sleep for five hours - but, I played a long distance in plus. <br><br>  The Dark Forester, having slightly recovered, went out in the Bethke, where, nevertheless, a lot of work remained.  If I ever need to look for a job, I know that the graph in the biography of the Dark Forester and the Program Wars (maybe brought to mind by that time) will play not a small role, as well as experience in Java. <br><br>  I gave a private loan and a huge part of other government loans.  The day before the new year 2017, we finally moved to a new apartment in a good area of ‚Äã‚ÄãMunich.  And yes, I can go to McDonald‚Äôs again every day.  The story does not end there; it is still only its beginning, well, and you will hear the continuation only when the released mark appears in the Dark Forester column. <br><br>  I hope I managed to motivate at least someone.  Yes, we live without the ‚ÄúLoad‚Äù and ‚ÄúRestart‚Äù buttons, but all the failures aimed at doing this do not give you a sickly Experience, and this experience is not in the third Diablo, but in your own life, in the best RPG that you can play. <br><br>  And I'll finish with the words from Breaking Bad and Batman, I do all this for my daughter, yes ... <br>  but, nevertheless, I do it all for myself. <br><br>  And, I believe that each of you sitting on the other side of the monitor may be doing more than just a man! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6d2/5f1/d78/6d25f1d78ddfbdd1980ecc6ab76df519.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/319266/">https://habr.com/ru/post/319266/</a></p>
