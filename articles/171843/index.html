  <section class="page js-page"><h1>CeBIT 2013. Day two. Intel Extreme Masters, ASRock, Enermax</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> The second day at CeBIT 2013 did not foreshadow new discoveries.  Traditionally, the huge Intel Extreme Masters Pavilion beckoned gamers from all over Germany and offered a glimpse of the game to the best starcrafters and other masters of eSports art.  In the halls where component manufacturers were exhibited, there was an atmosphere of calm and constancy.  ASRock (with the help of a nitrogen-game show) and Enermax (with the help of a competition for the coolest photo with promoters) actively tried to entertain the visitors. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/55f/585/e7f/55f585e7f1c3dee7012824ded9932916.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Intel Extreme Masters</b> <br>  For those who want to play, Intel has set up the "modest" configuration boards.  Really why not?  Gamers - people are impressionable, like the process - will buy a new computer.  On the other hand, if you don‚Äôt demonstrate the best, then why plan an exhibition at all. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/aba/4f1/e20/aba4f1e209dcaf665c5882130120adb1.jpg"><br>  Despite the fact that the official release of StarCraft II: Heart Of Swarm is scheduled for March 12, the championship is already underway and the real masters have mastered the addition long before the release.  Mikhail Gaida (Kas) from Team.Empire and Artem Garavtsov (sLivko) from Virtus.Pro are among Russian-speaking players.  I wish the guys every success in their difficult struggle with European and Asian gamers. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c1d/61a/3f3/c1d61a3f34f64d1e6d7afc8246b06c3b.jpg"><br>  For those who have little understanding in games (like me, for example), Intel installed simulators of racing cars similar to Formula 1.  Those interested could sit in the cockpit and drive on virtual tracks.  The line to the attraction exceeded in size the analog directed to the buffet. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c9f/bec/e82/c9fbece82f084a0de1201cdea299238f.jpg"><br>  But this was a real surprise for me.  Of course, one should not underestimate the popularity of World Of Tanks in Russia, but it was nice to meet a big stand in Hanover.  Wargaming.net put not only test boards, but also erected a stage where professionals showed their skills in tank battles.  If the trend continues, most likely next year the world championship will be held on a par with StarCraft II in the discipline of World Of Tanks. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9a3/ea4/d6a/9a3ea4d6a9f57dea38a7a5825d9e0ee1.jpg"><br><br>  <b>ASRock</b> <br><br>  One of the largest exhibition stands is owned by ASRock.  The exposition included the old series of motherboards based on Intel Z77 and Intel X79 chipsets, but at the same time the company demonstrated its preparations for the release of Haswell processors - ASRock Z87 Extreme6 and ASRock H87 Pro4.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/aad/448/d20/aad448d20be67228813139ed6bce5c8a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3d1/51b/128/3d151b128895b68da22c379820fdaccd.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bc5/511/f5c/bc5511f5cf9eb412f6c81d840dd7441b.jpg"><br><br>  Three stars of the overclocking community were invited to conduct a nitrogen show and demonstrate the overclocking capabilities of ASRock motherboards - a huge redhead Finnish SF3D (in the world of Petri Korhonen, a physical therapist by profession), Yugoslav Perica_barii (Dusan Nikosevic) and Nick_Shih from Taiwanese (he is Nick‚Äôs Nick_Shih). , not married).  And while the legend of the European overclock worked on the stand, pouring nitrogen from the hybrid processor from AMD, his Taiwanese counterpart with passion threw on a racing simulator at a nearby exposition =). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/50f/979/8cf/50f9798cfbe186aa5628340ec27d2323.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/738/cad/b8a/738cadb8ae538a48ad0007cf7c509ce0.jpg"><br><br>  And this is a joke of the week.  Well, consider me conservative, harmful and even biased, but the server from ASRock is just ridiculous.  A company that has been a low-cost airline all its life and is associated with budget solutions has suddenly climbed into a segment where a reputation for stable and reliable technology is needed.  I do not know about you, but I‚Äôll buy an ASRock production server as a last resort. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3bf/f59/f30/3bff59f30a3c09d272b5fddbaab5245a.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Enermax</b> <br><br>  Who holds the brand is Enermax - every year the stand is beautifully decorated and pleases the eye on the background of white boxes with Chinese handicrafts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b24/714/459/b247144598a1a86bb097ebdefa2840bd.jpg"><br>  Of the amazing gizmos this time showed 180 mm fans with protection against water.  Why, I do not really understand, but everything works.  From the small pool, the water evaporated directly to the fan, which ‚Äúwithout steaming‚Äù let the moisture through the blades and threw it out. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bba/1f0/81a/bba1f081acda33822bf484296796ec01.jpg"><br>  The system of liquid cooling of unattended type has been demonstrated for a long time, but it really went on sale only in the first quarter.  According to representatives of the company, the first batches of goods scattered in just 2 weeks and now there is a shortage of goods in warehouses. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/44b/e74/b09/44be74b098bd06e50e20a98727c9d433.jpg"><br>  New supports for massive laptops (apparently, such as in yesterday's report from the MSI stand) also do not look very logical against the background of universal hysteria on ultrabooks.  Nevertheless, the product is of high quality and pleasantly made, which, again, plus the German manufacturer. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/399/ebe/fa6/399ebefa64993fc722842313294ba940.jpg"><br>  A fanless power unit with a certificate of 80 Plus Platinum is the result of an arms race with other manufacturers.  The power of 650 watts seems redundant, but it's cool when the computer gets one 120 or 140 mm fan less, the noise level drops, although frankly, to enthusiasts the noise level has never been a hindrance. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9ca/77a/a6a/9ca77aa6a140a74e33b95ab82df564b0.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Other and Microsoft</b> <br>  At the beginning of the first report, I warned that there were few top brands at the exhibition, so it was time to embrace "brothers in different ways."  The Chinese brought kayfovye environmentally friendly bamboo keyboard, mice and calculators.  It looks very cool, fingers are nice to knock on wood, only a variety of colors can not be expected.  Maybe in the future, there will be rosewood or sandalwood keyboard?  Why not? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2a3/f6a/205/2a3f6a20513c683a02a9a4083b999069.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3ce/754/c6f/3ce754c6f697a812341523e38d0a2afd.jpg"><br><br>  Well now jokes.  Below on the photo booth of Microsoft.  Large, with a bunch of demonstrations and a lot of advertising (sarcasm).  Looks like selling Windows 8 completely knocked down the industry giant.  I have no other explanation for what happened. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0ed/bf1/997/0edbf199784daadcfc0b81624c211519.jpg"><br><br>  But this is also fun.  They say that the organizers wanted to close half of the 17th hall due to the lack of tenants and it would be better to close it.  What does acupuncture have to do with the IT industry remains to guess.  Of course, the version that this is the best way to fix the sick admin visited my head, but not at the exhibition ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e75/517/d23/e75517d23108957ffe17f004fcaa60a6.jpg"><br><br>  Young ladies :) Here you have a small portion of female smiles from the exhibition <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/063/148/8f5/0631488f58028304dc7b2bb4ad8a79e1.jpg"><br><br>  Stay in touch.  Tomorrow I'll look for some more miraculous gizmos.  I'm going to walk in the Sino-Hong Kong-Korean-Malaysian sector.  The main thing is not to eat me there, like Captain Cook =) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/171843/">https://habr.com/ru/post/171843/</a></p>
