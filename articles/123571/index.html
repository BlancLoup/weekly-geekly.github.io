  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Amazon Kindle warranty replacement instructions</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>Habr√© already had <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/ebooks/105945/">an article about the Amazon Kindle warranty return</a> , but I want to expand it a bit and add it, so this will be the second version.</i> <br><br>  For those who do not know, I explain that Amazon is carrying out a warranty free replacement of its famous reader, even if it is damaged due to your fault (most often, a reckless fall and a broken screen as a result).  You could buy a reading room directly in Amazon, and could in any other store - this does not change matters.  However, there are difficulties: free replacement is carried out only in the USA and Europe, so if you are a resident of other neighborhoods, welcome to <a name="habracut"></a>  habrakat. <br><br><h4>  1. We will get an address in the USA. </h4><br>  First we need a postal address in the United States.  To do this, use the well-known service <a href="http://www.shipito.com/">Shipito</a> .  When registering, we need to pay $ 8.5 for finding the mailing address.  It will be valid for a month and you can send yourself one post through it. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <b>Total:</b> $ 8.5 ‚âà 238 rubles. <br><br><h5>  1.1 Payment. </h5><br>  Possible payment options - by credit card or via PayPal.  If your bank card is not suitable for this (or you do not have it at all), it is very convenient to use the MasterCard Prepaid card from the Yandex.Money service.  To do this, we register on <a href="https://money.yandex.ru/">Yandex.Money</a> , replenish the account in any convenient way and <a href="">order a virtual bank card</a> .  When ordering a card, we set the amount that we put on the card balance, for the brave, uncheck the SMS alerts and - voila!  It is necessary to add that we will not be given a $ 8.5 card, so it makes sense to calculate in advance all costs and immediately put the necessary amount.  The card is still useful to us. <br><br>  <b>Costs:</b> 2% for the service ‚âà 5 rubles. <br>  <b>Total</b> 243 rubles. <br><br><h4>  2. Register a reader on Amazon.com </h4><br>  If you have not registered it yet, it's time to do it.  Go to the Amazon site, <a href="http%253A%252F%252Fspecs.openid.net%252Fauth%252F2.0%252Fidentifier_select">register</a> .  In your personal account we <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/css/account/cards/view.html/ref%3Dya_30%3Fie%3DUTF8%26viewID%3DaddCard">add information about a bank card in the Add a Credit or Debit Card section</a> (we need this).  In the Add a New Address section, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/css/account/address/view.html%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dya_60%26viewID%3DnewAddress">add information about the address we received in Shipito</a> .  Next, go <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/digital/fiona/manage%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dya_kindle_sb_myk_button_css">to the Manage Your Kindle page</a> and select Register a Kindle in the left column.  To register, you need the serial number of the device.  If you have a second-generation Kindle, it is listed on the back of the device.  If the third one, then it can be found either through <i>Settings</i> ‚Üí <i>Device Information</i> or on the original packaging.  If you have no packaging left, no information about the serial number in the store receipt, the screen does not work and you have not registered your Kindle before, then I have bad news - I don‚Äôt know how to register your device. <br><br>  Therefore, if your Kindle is not broken yet, register it now! <br><br>  By the way!  Do not forget to transfer the library from the reader to the local computer - despite the fact that the screen is broken, the device works fine via USB. <br><br><h4>  3. Call an Amazon operator </h4><br>  You need to call straight to Amazon.  In theory, you can give them your phone number and they will call back themselves so as not to plunge you into the next expenses.  But, unfortunately, they don‚Äôt call Russia, so I‚Äôll have to take this labor upon myself.  We call by phone +1 866 321-8851.  Skype allows you to call this phone for free.  You will have to call in English the e-mail box to which your account is registered on Amazon and call the postal address you provided.  You will be identified and asked what happened to the reader.  Feel free to say that you dropped it and the screen crashed. <br><br>  After finding out the details, they will send you a link to a special image with bar codes and simply codes, which, if we lived in the US, it would be enough to stick it on the package and send it to an encrypted address.  This is not going to work out for us, so ask for the real mailing address directly in the telephone conversation.  If you still send only a picture with a barcode, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/contact-us/kindle-help.html/ref%3Dhp_kindle_cu_kh_%3Fie%3DUTF8%26nodeId%3D200144510">write in support</a> , indicating the Order ID, which will be in the incoming letter. <br><br>  Interestingly, in the Amazon I was asked to send them information about how much it cost to send a broken device to them.  If we used the above barcode, the postage would cost us nothing - their cost is paid by Amazon.  They promised to return the money I spent on postal services on the card (they could not do it - MasterCard Prepaid does not allow replenishing the account).  Another surprise was that they send a new reading room, not waiting for a broken one to come to them.  This is already something fantastic by Russian standards.  If within a month from the moment of the conversation nothing has come to them, the amount equal to the cost of the new reader is deducted from your card, so we don‚Äôt postpone the case, go to the post office. <br><br><h4>  4. Departure of a broken Kindle </h4><br>  We pack the reader in the original packaging (I took it from friends), take the printed picture with bar codes (it identifies what the return is from you) and go to the international post office.  In Moscow, the only place where you can send an electronic device (even a broken one) to the United States is the <a href="http://maps.yandex.ru/%3Fol%3Dbiz%26oid%3D1001204025">international post office at Nagatinskaya</a> . <br><br>  <b>The cost of departure from Moscow</b> - 319.90 rubles.  (simple air) <br>  <b>Total:</b> 561.90 rubles. <br><br><h4>  5. Registration of delivery in Russia </h4><br>  Three days later, Shipito received a notification: the parcel arrived at your address (even the photograph of the parcel is attached).  In the personal account we indicate the address of delivery to Russia.  Fill out the customs declaration at the link Customs Declaration.  Choose a shipping method.  I recommend USPS Priority Mail - in this case, you will receive a notification in your (real) mailbox with which you can go to the post office at your place of residence.  USPS Express Mail provides delivery directly to the address. <br><br>  Our shipment is small in mass - so a cheaper delivery is available to us - the USPS Priority Mail Flat-Rate Envelope.  Its cost does not include insurance.  Googling about the successful experiences of obtaining insurance with the USPS did not give anything, quite the contrary - the forums are full of messages that it is impossible to get insurance for electronic devices.  Therefore, fingers crossed, choose USPS Priority Mail Flat-Rate Envelope. <br><br>  Comment on insurance from <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/kalobok/" class="user_link">Kalobok</a> : It <i>may be problematic to get insurance itself, but there is still such a moment: without insurance, you will not even start looking for a missing package.</i>  <i>And with the insurance, the sender can make a request about the loss (it seems that at least one month should pass from the moment of sending).</i>  <i>My experience shows that at such a request the parcel is usually located (approximately another month) and is delivered.</i>  <i>True, the request must be done by the sender, that is, as I understand it, Shipito.</i>  <i>I do not know if they are doing this.</i> <br><br>  <b>Expenses:</b> <br>  Departure: $ 13.95 ‚âà 391 rub. <br>  2% for using MasterCard: $ 0.7 ‚âà 8 rubles. <br><br>  <b>Total:</b> 961 rubles. <br><br><h4>  6. Getting a new Kindle </h4><br>  After 20 days (in my case), a notification appeared in the mailbox with a request to enter the mail.  Take the passport and go.  At the post office, be sure to check if the package has been broken and the weight indicated is correct before signing the receipt. <br><br>  As a result, about 1000 rubles, and for a certain number of steps taken, you will receive a new Kindle instead of a broken one.  Good luck! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/123571/">https://habr.com/ru/post/123571/</a></p>
