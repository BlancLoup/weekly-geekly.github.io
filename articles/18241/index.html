  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mobile 2.0 Man-number</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The biggest problem that is now associated with the abundance of cellular operators is the phone number by which you can find a person.  Suppose if your friend has 4 phone numbers for each of the operators and in order to find him you call all these numbers in order in order of increasing the cost of a call to the operator‚Äôs network. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Recently, there has been a trend in the world with the provision of a full number service when changing a full operator, there is in the sense that the code of the former cellular operator remains in the number.  only here you are already in another network.  Such a system is very convenient for the implementation of the principle of one person one number.  That is, it does not matter which operator he maintains, it‚Äôs enough for you to know his number and you will always find him. <br><br>  Another implementation of the principle of a person, not a number, is no longer through a telecom operator, but the capabilities of the phone and the software for it in the phone are several numbers from different operators per person.  When calling a subscriber, the phone determines which network your phone is on and which of the numbers it is more profitable to call, however, you can choose the list of priority numbers yourself, that is, the phone itself will automatically cycle through the subscriber‚Äôs contact numbers in descending order of the probability of finding the subscriber on this number call cost.  Also, if the phone allows the simultaneous presence of several SIM cards of different operators, the software automatically determined which SIM card to call to which of the numbers of the called subscriber. <br><br>  However, a more interesting situation is possible when there is a certain service, a sort of ‚Äúsubscriber number identification service‚Äù, something like the DNS system in the modern Internet.  After all, in fact, the phone number is the same ip address, for example, the subscriber‚Äôs name is a kind of alphabetic site address, and when the subscriber receives the subscriber‚Äôs name, he will automatically call the number that is assigned to him now or is considered active, or simply goes through all the numbers which are following the subscriber in order of decreasing some criteria.  On this topic, you can think of a lot of things, but this I describe just the general essence of the idea.

      There is a man tag idea.  that is, if many people put the number in contacts and called him Vasya Pupkin, then when you call Vasya Pupkin, this number will be called (well, or the list of the most relevant numbers will be displayed, therefore the tag), something like a search by tag is obtained)) but again In the previous case, there should be a service strip between the phone and the cellular networks, which will choose which number to send the call to. <br><br>  The main problem with these solutions is that it is not completely clear how much you will pay for the call to the subscriber, because the operator will be hidden.  Of course, you can put all this on the shoulders of the services so that they determine the profitability of the call, show the estimated price for the call. <br><br><br>  origanal written by <strong>me here</strong> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/18241/">https://habr.com/ru/post/18241/</a></p>
