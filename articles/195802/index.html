When will the top 10 and search traffic?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/c02/1ec/f0c/c021ecf0c531e2995137ae9efdc33b05.jpg" align="left">  Search engines increasingly complicate the rules of the game.  In July, Yandex launched a beta version of the ‚ÄúIslands‚Äù, last Friday, on its 15th anniversary, Google announced a new search algorithm, Hummingbird, which would ‚Äúhumanize‚Äù the search.  Given the context of the search query, the location of the user and the construction of the phrase search engine will be able to understand the meaning of the query, and not just recognize the search words.  The search is getting closer to the user, but further from the optimizer?  Not really, today it is important to work not so much with links, as with the resource itself.  In this article we will talk about an effective SEO strategy for young sites. <br><br><h2>  What prevents the newly minted site to get into the TOP-10 </h2><br>  When ranking websites, search engines take into account many different factors, including age, subject, resource quality and other indicators. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The competition in the subject has a significant impact - the more sites presently present in this topic, the more difficult it is to get into the TOP.  Search engines are trying to show users not only relevant, but also ‚Äúreliable‚Äù sources - old sites of old companies that have been working in the market for several years and providing quality services.  Therefore, in search engines there is a filter that does not allow young and new sites to get to the first page of issue, especially for high-frequency queries - you first need to earn the trust of both users and search engines. <br><br><h2>  Effective SEO strategy </h2><br>  If the resource is young and has not yet gained enough weight for search engines, first of all its development and internal optimization are necessary: <br><ul><li>  Start with competitor analysis.  No wonder they say that the enemy always needs to know in person.  Pay attention to how competitors have a site structure, what are the sections, how goods or services are described.  The created site should be at least as good as the TOP competitors, and as a maximum - exceed them at the time of launch. </li><li>  Collect and analyze the maximum possible list of key requests (including high and low frequencies) and plan landing pages.  This work is very important to do at the stage of creating the site, thus preventing many common mistakes (such as the wrong structure of the resource).  Keep in mind that this is a key stage, on the basis of which all further progress will be built, so you should not independently engage in collecting requests and optimizing the stickiness of boarding, it is best to entrust this to professionals. </li><li>  Actively support the new site, especially during the first year after launch.  It is not enough just to start the site and forget, you need to constantly add new materials, update product descriptions, monitor the relevance of the posted and posted information.  This should be a permanent item of your work.  The site must evolve, and the search engines see that the project is alive and capable of giving users answers to their search queries. </li><li>  And only after the search traffic goes to the site with confidence, can you connect promotion.  Such a strategy will ensure the most natural traffic and the growth of the site positions. </li></ul><br><h2>  How do the indicators of the ‚Äúyoung‚Äù website change as you progress </h2><br><h3>  Links </h3><br>  For new sites, the purchase of links should be made slowly and gradually, so as not to fall under the sanctions of search engines.  The increase in the volume of the external link environment should look natural for search engines.

    <h3>  TIC and PR </h3><br>  While the site is young, no one knows it yet and there is no confidence in it, PR (characterizes the ‚Äúimportance‚Äù of the web page) is growing very slowly - by 1-2 units in a year or two.  TIC shows the authoritativeness of the site in the Yandex catalog is growing more actively, but in general, this indicator is not particularly informative for users. <br><br><h3>  Traffic growth proportional to content </h3><br>  The more interesting content, the better for site traffic!  This applies to resources of any age.  Younger sites in the first place it will give traffic on low frequency requests.  How many visitors will come to you after adding a new article on the site is difficult to say, it all depends on the subject matter and competition, as well as on the quality of the content itself.  For example, for online stores, constantly updating the content on the product card is an effective way to attract additional traffic.  A great example from our practice is the case of the Frisbee online store.  Thanks to competent work with content, the traffic of a young resource doubled every month. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/07f/e45/985/07fe4598592d71d368c8f41b39c500aa.png"><br><br>  Another example is the Avtovzglyad information resource, owned by the Moskovsky Komsomolets holding company.  Thanks to the creation of pages with useful thematic information, the traffic of the resource was increased three times in one and a half years of promotion. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/eca/898/c4d/eca898c4d35d63c065594207e7e86d75.png"><br><br><h2>  Do not forget about the benefits of advertising </h2><br>  At the stage of "growing up" the site will help any additional sources of advertising, because  they attract users.  As a result, the resource becomes more well-known, and if everything is still in order with content and usability, the behavioral factor grows, which indirectly affects the position in the search results and the trust of the search engine to the site. <br><br><h2>  Measure performance </h2><br>  Constantly analyze and evaluate search traffic: <br><br><ul><li>  From where, by what words and to which pages go to the site; </li><li>  How many of these requests users spend time on the site; </li><li>  Whether it is targeted requests or not; </li><li>  Is it possible to change something on the landing pages to improve the main indicators: failures, time spent by users on the page and the number of pages viewed; </li><li>  Set goals and monitor conversions, this information is sure to come in handy later when reporting. </li></ul><br><br><h2>  How long to wait for the top 10? </h2><br>  Much depends on the quality of the information provided on the site.  If it is stingy, there are no photos and there is no useful information for the user as a whole on the site, then waiting for the TOP-10 even by low-frequency queries can take a very long time, up to several months.  If the project is well thought out and started taking into account the interests of users, then the first low-frequency traffic will go two or three months after the start, and over time will only accumulate.  To achieve the top 10 for very high-frequency and competitive inquiries sometimes requires years of hard work as webmasters and content editors, and optimizers. <br><br>  You will definitely get to the top 10 search results if your site: <br><ul><li>  convenient; </li><li>  with quality content; </li><li>  working fast; </li><li>  regularly updated and improved. </li></ul><br>  Work on it and search engines will love you! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/195802/">https://habr.com/ru/post/195802/</a></p>
