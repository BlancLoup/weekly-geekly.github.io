  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Opera Software goes to BarCamp Central Asia 2010</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://files.myopera.com/IlyaShpankov/files/both-logo.png" alt="image"></div><br><br>  Summer is the time for BarCamp.  It is a fact.  But in Central Asia, summer in the usual sense comes to us a little earlier, and this is also a fact.  Therefore, it is not surprising that <a href="http://www.barcampkz.net/">BarCamp Central Asia 2010</a> , which will already be held in Almaty, Kazakhstan, from April 16 to 18, became the first sign of the 2010 season.  Also, the Kazakhstan Institute of Management, Economics and Forecasting (KIMEP) is a very modern educational institution, both in terms of external (architectural) and internal (selected by faculties), as the traditional venue for this, perhaps, the most interesting "IT" event in the Central Asian region. and specialties).  And it‚Äôs certainly not by chance that Opera Software has once again actively participated in both the organization and the program of this unique annual event. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For those who are not yet in the know (I hope there are not so many already) I will briefly explain what BarCamp is and how it differs from any other event connected with the sudden appearance of an impressive number of Internet users at a certain time in a certain place.  Without going into <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp">history</a> , this event can be called in one word - non-conference.  In contrast to the boring and pompous traditional "meetings", everything here is based on the principle of self-regulation: each participant makes a feasible contribution to the organization and technical equipment, draws up platforms for speeches and discussions and, of course, forms the theme of both individual sections and the whole event generally.  Therefore, despite the general understanding of the specifics of the audience and the BarCamp focus, no one can 100% predict what presentations and discussions will take place during several days of non-conference work.  Everything is born right here and right now, in real-time, while the person on the first day of the event who came only to ‚Äúlisten-watch‚Äù, on the last day can already present the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhis own startup, finding both like-minded people and investors. <br><br>  In general, as you have already understood, Opera Software simply cannot afford to miss such an interesting and useful event - the temptation of live communication with the audience of web developers and Internet users is too great: it allows you to be aware of everything that happens among young and very active Internet users - after all, they will dictate web fashion in a year or two.  In addition, Kazakhstan shows very good results in terms of growing the audience of Opera browser users, which is also important for us.  Here, for example, a few numbers. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      By the number of users of the desktop version of Opera, Kazakhstan ranks 10th in the world and 4th among the CIS countries, second only to Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, and over the past year the growth in the number of users amounted to almost 60% - this is one of the highest rates in the world.  According to Opera Mini, the results are even better: with a similar position in the ranking of countries by the number of users, the audience growth was more than 180% per year.  It is worth noting that these figures in Kazakhstan are significantly, several times higher than, for example, in countries such as the USA, Germany or Japan. <br><br>  This time, Opera Software is not only a participant, but also a partner of BarCamp Central Asia, receiving the status of ‚ÄúGolden‚Äù.  In addition to the traditional presentations, telling about new technologies and the company's plans for their implementation, there will be lively communication with the participants of the event, for which, in fact, we are going.  Already, the number of people willing to take part in this non-conference has exceeded 450, and this is far from the limit - representatives from other countries of the near and far abroad are planning to be at BarCamp.  Details can be read <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/barcamps/89973/">here</a> or on the <a href="http://www.barcampkz.net/">official website of the event</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/90679/">https://habr.com/ru/post/90679/</a></p>
