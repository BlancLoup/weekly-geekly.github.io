  <section class="page js-page"><h1>New service Payoneer: First of all cards, and partners only then ...</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Gone are the many New Year and Christmas holidays, and as a gift, Payoneer presents to all its users a new, long-awaited way of receiving the money earned. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Let us remind the respected community: the main purpose of the Payoneer service is to organize payroll projects for international companies. <br>  Today we are launching a new service that allows all recipients of payments to directly open an account with Payoneer, instead of registering with an existing partner, as it was before.  This is the first time that Payoneer provides a direct link to registration, using the new program ‚ÄúPayoneer-Affiliates". <br><br>  Maybe a little explanation is required of what ‚Äúaffiliate‚Äù is: according to the Wiki "... Affiliate program or Affiliate - a form of business cooperation between the seller and partners when selling a product or providing services" is for example , a website builder who recommends products from other companies or services.  He gets a bonus for sending customers to the merchant‚Äôs website.

      Our Virtual US Bank Account service, already <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/pay_system/95045/">mentioned</a> here, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/pay_system/95045/">was</a> selectively offered to Payoneer cardholders, which allowed them to receive payments from US companies (such as Paypal, Amazon, Google Checkout, Clickbank, etc.) directly to Payoneer MasterCard. <br>  So, meet - this service has changed its name, now it's ‚ÄúPayoneer US Payment Service‚Äù;  its tariffs are halved;  and it became available to everyone on its new website - <a href="http://www.payoneer-affiliates.com/%3Futm_source%3DCommunity%26utm_medium%3DLinks%26utm_campaign%3Dhabrahabr.ru">www.payoneer-affiliates.com</a> <br><br>  <i>What is the new Payoneer US Payment Service?</i>  ‚ÄúIt's simple: the Payoneer cardholder can get a virtual bank account tied to his card.  A bank transfer to this account will lead to instant replenishment of the balance on the card.  This account can be used only to replenish the card and only for local transfers (ACH, only in the USA). <br><br>  The new service will be useful to freelancers working with US exchanges, not making payments to Payoneer cards.  Photographers who collaborate with photo stocks that do not pay on our cards will finally be able to receive fees on the cards.  Finally, programmers who sell their software through registrars who are not directly connected to Payoneer will be able to receive their earnings on the card. <br>  <i>How does this service differ from what has been provided so far?</i>  - Now you do not have to wait until your employer starts working with Payoneer, if he makes payments to accounts in American banks, then you can automatically receive a payment to the card. <br><br>  <i>What you need to get started with a new card?</i>  - Fill out the registration form at <a href="http://www.payoneer-affiliates.com/%3Futm_source%3DCommunity%26utm_medium%3DLinks%26utm_campaign%3Dhabrahabr">www.payoneer-affiliates.com</a> , select the company from which you will receive payments and, after the mandatory verification, Payoneer US Payment Service will be enabled for you.  Detailed instructions for using the service will be available in the <a href="https://myaccount.payoneer.com/Login/Login.aspx">Personal Area</a> .  If the company from which you receive payments is not a Payoneer partner - please contact us at <a href="http://sales%40payoneer.ru/">sales (a) payoneer.ru</a> and we will turn to it with an offer to become our partner. <br><br>  <a href="http://community.payoneer.com/topic/759-new-virtual-account-policy/page__st__60">The list of companies</a> ( <i>replenished</i> ), from which it is now possible to receive payments directly to the card using the US Payment Service. <br>  And finally, another gift - everyone who signs up for the US Payment Service in January is exempt from the annual fee for 2012 ($ 20 value). <br><br>  Traditionally we recall the address of the Russian-speaking support: <a href="http://www.payoneer.com/contactUs.aspx">support (a) payoneer.ru</a> and the service of working with Russian partners: <a href="http://www.payoneer.com/becomeAPartner.aspx">sales (a) payoneer.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/136494/">https://habr.com/ru/post/136494/</a></p>
