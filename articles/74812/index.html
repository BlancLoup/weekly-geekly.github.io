  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Common mistakes when filing a tax return and how to avoid them</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The tips listed below apply to personal income tax declarations filed by individuals.  I summarize what citizens most appeal to, but unfortunately after the fact, after the declaration is submitted, the contract is concluded, and the average Russian does not even think about the tax consequences.  Vanity begins only after the tax payment request comes. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So, <b>typical mistakes when filing a personal income tax declaration:</b> <br><br>  <u>Error 1:</u> a tax deduction on personal income tax claimed a deduction and a tax on the sale of an apartment in one year (for example, 2008) and a deduction from the purchase of a new apartment, which was acquired in the new year (for example, 2009). <br>  How to do it: different tax returns are submitted, in the above case - for the sale for 2008, and for the purchase for 2009, tax deductions and tax payments are distributed accordingly. 
      <br>

        </script>
      <br>
      <u>Error 2:</u> filing a personal income tax declaration with a statement of the deduction from the sale of an apartment (house), which was owned for more than 3 years (provided in the amount of the apartment (house) value), when actually the apartment (house) was owned by a person for less than 3 years, for example, the apartment was privatized only 2 years ago, or the house was reconstructed, and as a result a new certificate of ownership was received. <br>  It is right: the dates of transfer of ownership of the property are checked, since at the time of filing the declaration, usually, the money already diverges and in case of ‚Äúunexpected‚Äù payments on taxes, it becomes problematic to find money to pay personal income tax. <br><br>  <u>Error 3:</u> filing a personal income tax declaration in which a tax deduction from the sale of 1/2 apartment (house) owned for less than three years for the full amount of the tax deduction ie  for 1 million rubles. <br>  How correctly: if half of the apartment (house) is sold ¬Ω tax deduction is provided - i.e.  put a deduction in the amount of 500 thousand rubles. <br><br>  <u>Error 4:</u> selling a house with a land plot that has been owned for less than three years in the amount of, for example, 500 thousand for a house and 1 million.  for the land (incorrect distribution of tax payments).  Which leads to an increase in the amount of taxes paid. <br>  How correctly: A tax deduction for a house that has been owned for less than three years is 1 million rubles, and a tax deduction for a land plot that has been owned for less than three years is 125 thousand rubles, therefore, in the example above, with a total amount of the purchase agreement - sales of land and houses of 1.5 million. The distribution should be as follows: 1 million - a house, 500 thousand land, then the amount of personal income tax will not be calculated from 875 thousand rubles, but from 375 thousand. <br><br>  <b>Causes of tax disputes:</b> <br>  1. a person filed a declaration without prior consultation with a tax lawyer, although he himself does not understand anything in taxes and in tax relations; <br>  2. a transaction was made, the consequences of which were not calculated by the tax legal relations. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/74812/">https://habr.com/ru/post/74812/</a></p>
