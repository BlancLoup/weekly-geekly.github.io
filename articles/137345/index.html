See it.  We are waiting for your comments. ‚Äù  I would kill. <br><br>  Such a manager, in fact, breaks the whole buzz.  He looks like a waiter who, instead of effectively tearing the lid off the silver dish and arranging the promised fire show, unceremoniously bangs the tray on the tablecloth and throws matches next to it.  Like, then sort it out yourself.  And in his eyes, it reads unequivocally: "You stifle the damn thing." <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cac/089/a04/cac089a041fa60e7a4d39c7c0751feaf.jpg"></div><br><h2>  - It's outrageous!  And that's why: </h2><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>First, the</b> client is waiting for not just a good result.  He is waiting for his demonstration.  The show, it seems, is not included in the contract, and your manager was not ‚Äúhired by a clown,‚Äù but a good presentation is half the success of the work.

      <b>Secondly, the</b> manager sends the work for which the designer has spent several hours, or even the best days of his life.  Just so take and "throwing" his work by mail - well, at least, disrespect for the work of others. <br><br>  <b>Thirdly, the</b> client may receive a letter in a fucking mood or at the wrong time, which means that the layout, no matter how good it is, will be perceived as ‚Äúyou have sent a picture ... so what?‚Äù. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f32/91e/838/f3291e83825af6095e75f1f9b6f57fa1.jpg"></div><br><br>  <b>Fourth, by</b> sending a mock-up by mail (or even a few options, with the posting ‚Äúcomment‚Äù), you ask the client to become a harsh critic.  He will gladly write to you detailed reviews that ‚Äúblack is not good,‚Äù ‚Äúnot the same rling‚Äù and ‚Äútoo much empty space on the layout of the site.‚Äù  And it will be much more difficult to convince him ‚Äúlater‚Äù - after all, the client has already strengthened his arguments. <br><br>  <b>Fifth, the</b> manager does not control the course of negotiations on the layout - as a result, does not receive feedback, does not hear the first emotions of the client.  (Your call is very important to us!) As a result, PM loses its ability to influence the course of events in-real-time, and this is 50% of the file. <br><br><h2>  - But then what to do?  Tell me, captain obvious! </h2><br><br>  So, here are a few simple steps to keep your presentation of the layout, which help to effectively display the layout - remotely.  Suppose a personal meeting does not work, because the client is in Vladivostok, and you are in Moscow.  Therefore, the presentation will be on Skype. <br><br>  <b>Arrange for a specific time.</b>  Usually I need a layout from 12 to 14 minutes.  Agree on the start time of the call and its duration.  It is important to agree on the duration, because in this case it becomes clear to the client that you have experience in the presentation of mock-ups, and therefore you will not waste your precious time on nonsense.  An hour and a half before the call - agree that everything is valid. <br><br>  <b>Do not send layouts beforehand, before calling.</b> <br>  The client should see the layout with you, you should receive instant feedback, so you need to send the layouts at the time of the negotiations.  You can - on Skype.  In this case - a slow channel will be your plus, because it stirs the customer's impatience. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/795/e22/d30/795e22d30f0dde66d17fdb3cbcc816ec.png"></div><br><br>  <b>Begin presentation.</b>  <b>Customize the customer in a friendly way.</b> <br>  As a rule, while working on a project (design), we have internal fights for certain elements of the models with the designer or art director.  We are trying out some ideas, some of them are rejected, some of them are recycled.  In this case, we may well deviate slightly from the initial sketch or TK. <br><br>  As a result, in the folder with the project - it is formed from 3 or more intermediate layouts, and the designer may like one option, the manager - the second, the art director - the third.  This is normal.  But we promised the client to show only one option.  Therefore, you tell him that inside your company there were quite serious battles for the layout and interface, you literally scuffled with the art director, but in the end, everyone remained with his. <br><br>  Now the client gets at the disposal instead of one layout - two or three of which he can choose.  But, nevertheless, I, as a project manager, will defend, for example, a lighter one, since it is he who best solves the client‚Äôs business problems. <br><br><h2>  - Why does the client like when he tickles his tum? </h2><br><br>  <b>Indeed, why do so is good:</b> <br><br>  <b>First,</b> the client has a choice, although the contract provides only one version of the layout.  The task of the manager in this case is to unobtrusively ‚Äúpush‚Äù the client to the choice of the final version of the layout. <br><br>  <b>Secondly, the</b> client sees that his project is not indifferent to your team.  No, well, it's true - you are also interested in giving the best solution. <br><br>  <b>Thirdly,</b> you, as a project manager, take the side of the project‚Äôs interests.  And you begin to protect them, first of all, from the client.  Because he may have his own, rather specific ideas about design, advertising, the Internet, etc.  This should not harm the mission of the project. <br><br>  <b>Fourth,</b> make a presentation to the person who makes the decision.  This item is sometimes very difficult to implement, but it is 99% success.  It makes no sense to make a good presentation to the middle manager, who then sends a letter with a layout to his director with a postscript: ‚ÄúHere, we have drawn.  Criticize! <br><br><h2>  - How about the presentation? </h2><br><br>  Personally, I prefer to send layouts via Skype in turn. <br><br>  Remind the customer how the pencil sketch looked like.  Which layout to send first - the one that you think is best, or start from the weakest (in your opinion) - depends on many factors, then you need to act according to circumstances.  I usually tell a story, as we went from the first version to the ‚Äúmost successful‚Äù. <br><br>  While the mockup ‚Äúflies‚Äù to the client - briefly tell with words what exactly will be drawn on the picture, what objects and colors are used and why they are solving the business problem.  As soon as the client received the layout and began to view it - answer questions in a friendly way, tell how the navigation will be arranged, what animation effects are planned and further on in the list. <br><br>  Show the remaining layouts, also at the time of sending - tell me why you decided to change something and why these changes more closely correspond to the goals of the project. <br><br>  In any case, the client will need time to think and digest what he saw.  Do not force him to make a decision immediately, but try to collect as much feedback as possible. <br><br>  Yes, end the conversation on a good note.  And agree on the next conversation. <br><br>  <b>I summarize:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  No layouts by e-mail.  Only a personal presentation or a skype presentation for 12‚Äì14 minutes. </li><li>  Friendly attitude.  Your words should smile. </li><li>  Tell a true story of the work on the layout.  Justify your ideas.  Show intermediate sketches.  Tell us about the course of your thoughts and team work on the project. </li><li>  Tell us about the conflict within the team (if it was) or about the unanimity (if it was), in general, tell us more truth and details about the progress of the work. </li><li>  Submit layouts one at a time. </li><li>  Let the client understand what he saw alone and make a decision. </li><li>  Ask questions.  Get feedback. </li><li>  Make a demonstration to the right people. </li></ul><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2a9/fda/bae/2a9fdabaef14a9d5814f99eeeebf1539.png"></div><br><br>  This is my personal experience.  If you have something to add / argue, or you know some chips that help you with the delivery of layouts - please share in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/137345/">https://habr.com/ru/post/137345/</a></p>
