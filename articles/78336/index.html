  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Modern office communications: MS Exchange</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In life, I am very interested in all the new communication technologies and I regularly buy new communication toys when new technologies or ideas appear in them.  But most people buy the same toys, even without representing their real potential.  This text is about how to unleash this potential. <br>  In principle, all ‚Äúcommunications‚Äù are primitive and easily decomposed into several areas: text, voice, video.  With the "video" is good only on computers, everything else is implemented in most phones. <br>  In the "voice" I will tell you about: VoIP / SIP in mobile phones WM5-6, Nokia N and E, Android, Fring and OCS, Asterisk.  I myself used everything in my work and docked with Cisco CME, gateways, SER, and sipnet. <br>  In the video, there is nothing to talk about: Skype already knows everything, except for MS OCS and Tsiskovsky video. <br><br>  For the transfer of the test, three classes of technologies are used - SMS, e-mail, instant messengers.  Moreover, SMS operators are absolutely not real money (in terms of traffic, you get at least $ 260 for ONE MB), from the other minuses - it is impossible to read, except from the phone;  limited message size;  periodically, monstrous roaming.  Of the benefits - even the most retirees know how to use it, at least read it, and in general there is no need for settings. <br><br>  E-mail is for ALL phones without exception (released less than 10 years ago), it costs on GPRS Internet tariffs on mobile phones and free of charge on Wi-Fi / WiMAX.  Can encapsulate ANY content, from plain text to video files.  Subspecies of mobile e-mail: normal smtp / pop3;  IMAP;  MS Exchange. <br>  I do not think that there will be a Habrchanin who does not know about smtp-pop3-imap, t.ch.  I'll tell you only about MS Exchange, which is often perceived as a wonder. <br>  Basic ideas that are embedded in Exchange: everything works through a single authorized encrypted connection to the server;  on the server "lies" everything, and all clients are only synchronized;  synchronized data - mail folders, contacts, tasks, calendar.  In all Windows Mobile devices there is a built-in client, and on Nokia it is necessary to install a native client: <a href="http://europe.nokia.com/support/download-software/mail-for-exchange/compatibility-and-download">europe.nokia.com/support/download-software/mail-for-exchange/compatibility-and-download</a> . <br>  Examples of settings for Mobile can be viewed on the website <a href="http://hosting-exchange.ru/setup">hosting-exchange.ru/setup</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a>  By the way, in the same place, you can take on ready-made service: they give you a full service within an hour and do not require money, but after a couple of weeks you subscribe or refuse. <br>  The main "chips", because of which all my mail on ekschendzhah: <br>  1. calendar synchronization on a mobile phone.  It is very convenient when colleagues make an appointment, sending it to everyone in the office, and after a minute it is displayed as ‚Äúnext event‚Äù on the display of mobile phones in standby mode). <br>  2. access to mail / contacts / calendar via the web-interface, looks exactly like a regular Outlook.  OWA is called.  And connect to it through an honest encrypted HTTPS, which I still believe. <br>  3. synchronization of mail with a mobile phone - one joy to clean spam and read letters when you kill time while waiting for your turn in some institution.  Then you open it on a beech - and there everything is already read, everything unnecessary has been deleted.  I used to go through my pop3 mail to a mobile phone, I read / delete everything two times - it strained. <br>  4. The speed and privacy of walking messages from a mobile phone to a mobile phone is free of SMS sores, faster than SMS, also costs many orders of magnitude cheaper ... and is not recorded or analyzed by any authorities (only the most naive believe in the secret of communication through cellular operators).  I often used sms before, and now I send 2-3 per month, because  all who spoke already on ekschendzha transplanted.  You want no one to read your mail - or from each device, raise the VPN - it is terrible, or use strong encryption in the same SSL / HTTPS.  I have few places where I stayed because  most only close the mail and it was necessary.

      How much is and how to sell.  There are three typical options for deploying a service: <br>  <b>1. Independently and place in his office.</b> <br>  To do this: a reliable server with a performance proportional to the number of users, about the organization of external backups and reliable storage system - I don‚Äôt even speak, and this is understandable.  Reliable hardware traffic filtering system (as a separate device in front of a refreshment, such as a Cisco PIX, or a Linux server, but certainly not a Zyxel / d-link). <br>  Knowledge / competence, the option ‚Äúleave everything by default‚Äù - from the evil one, will result in a large downtime and huge maintenance costs.  Competence on eskchendzhu must necessarily be accompanied by a very good level of network security and a clear understanding of where the data is going to fly - without this, it is simply impossible to release Windows on the Internet, and Windows with all contacts and mail - all the more.  There are no holes and errors in technology, they are only in specific implementations, in the form of errors of specific people ... and more often the errors of administrators are more terrible than of programmers. <br>  Software licenses.  Licenses required: Windows Server, Exchange, CAL licenses, account for several thousand bucks.  At the same time, the lifetime of the software (from version to version) is about 2 years. <br>  <b>2. Deploy yourself in a data center.</b>  Rent a VPS (for example, in e-StyleISP) In this case, you can get a ready-made VPS with a pre-installed Windows Server and licenses.  This solution is much more reliable than a hardware server, since  VPS runs on failover clusters and data is stored in reliable storage areas, all hardware and channels are reserved.  Licenses in the form of SaaS (e-StyleISP Microsoft Gold Partner, SPLA provider) are cheaper and more convenient than just buying software (total costs for a product‚Äôs lifetime are less). <br>  According to the required competence - the requirements are slightly lower only for network security.  In your data center, at your request, with a large camera operator, you will be filtered out of everything you ask for, and specifically in e-StyleISP they will also advise you on what to filter for Exchange sevris, because  know and are able to. <br>  <b>3. Take hosted Exchange service.</b>  <b>Only four companies in Russia provide a full-fledged Hosted Exchange (e-StyleISP is one of them, read more at <a href="http://hosting-exchange.ru/">hosting-exchange.ru</a> )</b> .  Exchange service is deployed on a separate rack of new powerful servers, which are looked for by highly qualified specialists.  Servers are in a reliable data center.  It all looks very simple: they give a login / password to the control panel, where you can administer accounts of your users, kill domains, manage DNS and in general everything you need, but at the same time all users are completely isolated between themselves.  In general, it is necessary to test, just do not describe everything.  We have a secretary in general in one of the companies of the ‚Äúadministrator‚Äù account, just 20 minutes of explanations was enough for the panel to be mastered ... since then, only two times addressed the admins. <br>  Of interesting, e-StyleISP has an agent and WhiteLabel program, according to which you can resell the service under your brand, and e-StyleISP acts as an invisible OEM manufacturer.  So many hosters are already working ... deploying your Exchange hosting is monstrously long and expensive, so hosters get hooked.  An agent program is more likely for admins of multiple users, instead of deploying everything for each office of a dozen people, they are connected to the hosted service.  On the one hand, they are empowered to manage the whole economy and receive money, but on the other hand, everything always works and there is no need to waste your time.  For the money, usually for the year runs up more than you can one-time for the "default setting" shake. <br><br>  The following text will be about the voice, it will be more interesting, read. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/78336/">https://habr.com/ru/post/78336/</a></p>
