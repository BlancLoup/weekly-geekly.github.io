  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Five major trends in the development of the Internet of Things in 2018</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The past 2017 was another important year for the Internet of Things (IoT).  Consumers continued to buy all new connected devices, and as a result, virtual digital assistants with speech recognition became one of the most popular New Year gifts in many countries.  In addition, last year the first official launch of the services and products of Narrow Band IoT (NB-IoT) took place, and finally, according to statistics, today there are more IoT devices in the world than smartphones or PCs. <br><br>  What does the new 2018 bring with it for the Internet of Things?  We are discovering five major trends that we believe will determine the coming year. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nt/yl/zx/ntylzxfs5so8ndi4wncvkeuosl4.jpeg" width="100%"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>1. Even more connected devices and more connectivity.</b>

      In 2017, we observed an increase in the number of all kinds of devices and ways to connect them, and this trend will continue in 2018.  In particular, we will see further development of networks based on Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN), such as NB-IoT, Sigfox and LoRaWAN.  These technologies make it possible to increase the autonomous service time of devices that must operate without recharging for up to several years, and at the same time provide reliable connection over long distances. <br><br>  We expect that the widespread introduction of such devices will lead to real social change - for example, it will improve environmental monitoring to address the problem of global climate change.  The development of home automation services will make our life much easier and easier.  In addition, the era of intelligent production.  Given the whole wave of pilot projects and a number of pilot launches in 2017, we expect that in the coming year we will see a number of important initiatives in this direction.  According <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20171207005963/en/IDC-Forecasts-Worldwide-Spending-Internet-Things-Reach">to IDC forecasts</a> , in 2018 alone, $ 189 billion will be spent on smart manufacturing projects. <br><br>  More and more companies will start their own projects for the Internet of Things, and they will need recommendations for connecting, storing data, remote monitoring, etc. <br><br>  <b>2. The development of peripheral computing with the ability to monitor in real time</b> <br><br>  With the increasing number of IoT projects, especially in the industrial sphere, where devices can be installed on geographically separated objects, at a considerable distance from each other, we will see more active use of real-time data at the periphery (that is, on the connected devices themselves).  In addition to reducing the cost of data transmission and storage, this approach will allow for instant data analysis, providing the opportunity for making more operational and more informed decisions. <br><br>  According to IDC, by 2019, 40% of all data generated by the Internet of Things will be stored and analyzed on the network edge. <br><br>  <b>3. The development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology and machine learning</b> <br><br>  We will see further development of machine learning technologies that will help make devices for the Internet of Things even more effective, and move from a rule-based approach to a more serious, planned-preventive approach.  In particular, devices will be able to more effectively identify potential attacks before these attacks start causing damage. <br><br>  Providers of IoT services and devices will be able to offer new recognition services (matching services), which will be based on in-depth analysis of the specifics of user tasks ‚Äî the IoT device will be able to independently study how end users interact with the service or product.  In large-scale implementations, when it comes to hundreds or thousands of IoT devices, artificial intelligence technologies will play a special role - without them, connecting devices into a network and collecting data will be a very difficult task. <br><br>  Today we see active discussions that artificial intelligence will crowd out people in the workplace, but we believe there are not so many reasons for these fears.  Technologies will perform the tasks for which artificial intelligence is ‚Äúsharpened‚Äù, allowing people to focus on fundamentally new, more creative tasks. <br><br>  <b>4. Expansion of the regulatory framework, the emergence of new safety standards</b> <br><br>  The need for more advanced and reliable security technologies for the Internet of Things will grow.  We will witness all new attacks, as a result of which we will more often discuss security problems for the Internet of things, as well as the potential damage from such attacks.  According to the results of <a href="https://www.gemalto.com/press/Pages/Gemalto-survey-confirms-that-Consumers-lack-confidence-in-IoT-device-security-.aspx">our survey last year</a> , most organizations and consumers consider it necessary to create a new regulatory framework for the security of the Internet of Things, and they would like the government to take part in forming these standards. <br><br>  As companies work to improve the security of their services and products, the practice of creating partnerships with external experts in the field of the Internet of Things will become more common.  This includes working with ‚Äúwhite hackers‚Äù, experts on the security of the Internet of Things, as well as establishing awards for the discovered vulnerabilities, which will allow testing the existing infrastructure, identifying possible vulnerabilities and making the necessary improvements. <br><br>  <b>5. Development of comprehensive, universal platforms for the Internet of Things</b> <br><br>  Especially in demand from manufacturers will use the platform for the Internet of things, which would provide at once the full range of necessary technologies.  And the best here will be such platforms that are able to meet all the needs of the manufacturer or service provider - including from the point of view of connection organization, support for all connection protocols, security, scalability, remote monitoring, secure data storage capabilities, and which would provide API support for the largest cloud service providers (AWS, IBM, Microsoft, etc.). <br><br>  These competitive platforms for the Internet of Things will enable IoT service providers to develop their products even faster and easier, while ensuring an adequate level of security. <br><br>  Of course, by the end of the year we will see other important events and unexpected surprises, but whatever they may be, we will no doubt be in for another exciting year. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/347230/">https://habr.com/ru/post/347230/</a></p>
