In fact, now and here will be funny.  Well, let the peculiar humor on Habr√©. <br>  The article was written by me around 2000.  at the age of 13.  At that time I was familiar with the Internet for no more than 2-3 months. <br>  Go! <br><br>  The life path of a hacker. <br><br>  Before you start laying out the steps of a person‚Äôs life ‚Äúfrom a mere mortal to hackers‚Äù, I want to immediately explain (so that there are no unnecessary quibbles, because the literate people have gone) that in this article (I emphasize IN THIS), some kind of reasonable -thinking in computers, networks, etc.  etc.  being.  Here I do not break these people up into smaller groups, but simply say HACKER, but put the meaning of words in this word, such as hacker, cracker (cracker), phreaker, spammer, etc. ... I think it‚Äôs simple and clear . <br>  Well, we figured out, you can proceed:

      <b>Stage 0 ///</b> People live for themselves and live, occasionally go to a friend to play on an old Sega Mega Drive in MORTAL KOMBAT and do not even suspect the existence of DOOM, not to mention PENTIUMs and similar "modern things." . <br><br>  <b>The first step ///</b> This person, by some miracle, learns about the whole enta and buys the ‚Äúnew‚Äù Pentium 166MMX 32RAM, thereby becoming a user.  Not very cool - you say.  Indeed, but this is only the beginning !!!  Further more! <br><br>  <b>2nd step, direction A - deadlock ///</b> Immediately after the purchase, playing sappers a couple of times, solitaire, changing the desktop background, design, color scheme, screen resolution, sounds with each action, the user leaves the computer gather dust in an old vacuum cleaner box. <br><br>  <b>The second step, direction B, is the correct ///</b> Having tried all of the above, the user does not cast his ‚ÄúBeast‚Äù, but rather becomes attached to it.  He understands the meaning of SAPER deeper, drives the arrow faster and faster across the screen, and more and more often buys compacts with toys. <br><br>  <b>3rd step ///</b> User begins to study all sorts of work, utility programs.  Now he already understands that MS WINDOWS is not needed without MS OFFICE, although these names still reproduce with difficulty.  More and more places are occupied by hard programs on hard drives, such as Photoshop, WinRar, WinAmp, etc. <br><br>  <b>The 4th step, direction A, is a dead end ///</b> Now this dude is already a fairly competent user, BUT no more ... And why? ... - he doesn't need anything more. <br><br>  <b>The fourth step, direction B, is the right /// A</b> person has already thoroughly studied Windy, he is no longer so attracted by the sidyuk racks in stores, I want something new ... ... And then the user decides to connect to the INTERNET ... <br><br>  <b>Fifth step ///</b> Having made such a decision, he realizes that his old Pentium 166MMX is no good at all and needs to be upgraded ......., but then he learns that MOM will not get along with his 20GB hard drive, and the video card with a memory of more than 8MB, fuck is not needed, with 32MB of RAM and 3GB on the hard disk.  Need to buy a new comp!  - he decides, and having saved up about 800 greens, he buys a Pent III 1.1GHz 256RAM.  Everything is ready, now you can start surfing Net's virtual spaces. <br><br>  <b>The 6th step, direction A, is a dead end ///</b> And now - A new, cool computer has access to the Internet.  Here is the degradation of the user.  He is only busy with sitting in chat rooms, conferences, watching porn and ... ... That's it !!!  Thus, he becomes Lamer, who is online, like the Chinese in China.  He thinks.  That he is cool, he can do everything, that he is INDEPENDENCE, but he doesn‚Äôt even suspect that if a competent guy needs to spoil him, he will do it without any problems ... <br><br>  <b>6th step, direction B - correct ///</b> Pretty (2-3 months) after sitting in chat rooms, conferences, entertainment portals, he begins to be interested in the topic of HAC, starts to go to Hack sites, read all sorts of hack documentation, order a freebie ( hacker + freeloader = brothers).  On theory, he begins to understand quite a lot ... but not in practice. <br><br>  <b>7th step ///</b> This, already quite reasonable user opens his own website.  Let a little unsightly, but yours !!!  And on this step, he begins to practice hacker art.  As a rule, many start with ‚Äújokes‚Äù in chat rooms, and then everything develops into something more, for example, unauthorized access to a neighbor‚Äôs computer, etc.  Starting from this stage, you can call him a hacker, although if there was a diminutive pet word from the word hacker, then at this stage I would call our hero exactly that way. <br><br>  <b>The eighth step, the final ///</b> Having a lot of training on chats, neighbors, a favorite university, our hero decides that besides pleasure it would be nice to get stable (if not stable, then good) profit from all this heroism.  And then he organizes himself or enters a really serious hack club.  After that, big things start ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/21625/">https://habr.com/ru/post/21625/</a></p>
