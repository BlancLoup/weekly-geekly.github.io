Next, I will tell just about how much we pay and give a brief instruction on registration in the referral program. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For those who are not yet familiar with our service, I will write: we are engaged in exporting company profiles from the 2GIS directory in CRM: 1C-Bitrix24 (‚ÄúCorporate Portal‚Äù), Bitrix24 and Megaplan.  Users of the <a href="https://www.lead4crm.ru/">Lead4CRM</a> service (‚ÄúLead Generator‚Äù) do not need to conclude a separate contract, provide for a method of instant payments, as well as users independently choose what information they want to receive at any time, and there is even no minimum package limit, i.e.  There is no need to purchase any tariff plan. <br><br>  So, it is possible to make money on our service through deductions from payments of attracted customers.  We pay 10% of the amount of all payments from attracted customers.  We make payments on requests either to a personal account for further use of the Lead4CRM service, or to a bank account.  In the case of a payment to a personal account, then there are no restrictions on the amount, in the case of a payment on the account, the minimum amount is set at 10,000 rubles.  That is, you can immediately receive a payment in the amount of 12,500 rubles from the 1st attracted customer, if he pays for the MAX Company tariff plan for 25,000 company profiles, and this I will tell you not so much.

      <strong>I will give an example:</strong> <br><br><ol><li>  Our company is engaged in the wholesale of spare parts for foreign cars, we know our market segment, so we will start searching for potential customers. </li><li>  Having found everyone who is engaged in retail sales of auto parts for foreign cars in the city of Moscow, we will receive a list of 2,000 companies. </li><li>  But we are selling not only in one city, we are interested in all such companies throughout Russia, which means we‚Äôll see how many similar auto shops in other, smaller cities.  Looking at the result of the issue, we can safely say that in each small city there are at least 500 such auto shops, which means that we can easily calculate the required number of profiles we need: 500 * 91 (large cities - Moscow) = 45,500 + 2,000 (Moscow) = 47,500 Company profiles we need to build a database of potential customers. </li><li>  Since our company is clearly working with someone, we do not need to obtain absolutely all company profiles, and therefore we will reduce the required number of profiles hypothetically by 1/3 and we will get 31,660 profiles. </li><li>  Looking at the tariff plans on the site <a href="https://www.lead4crm.ru/price/">Lead4CRM.ru</a> we find out what the ‚ÄúCompany MAX‚Äù tariff is suitable for us, but only 25,000 profiles are provided there, but we will finish up to 31,600 just with money, because  each profile above the tariff plan package will be considered at the price of 5 rubles per profile. </li><li>  As a result, we obtain the final cost of this information: 31,600 - 25,000 = 6,600 profiles outside the package at a price of 5 rubles per 1 = 33,000 rubles.  + 125 000 rub.  (cost of the tariff) = <strong>158 000 rub.</strong> </li></ol><br>  Having calculated the cost of data for the 1st attracted client, you can safely say that you will earn <strong>15,800 rubles</strong> on such a client <strong>.</strong> <br><br>  It turns out that if you have an information resource that is designed for a B2B audience with sufficient attendance, then by placing information about the Lead4CRM service you will have a passive income of at least <strong>30,000 rubles.</strong>  while not putting any effort. <br><br><h2>  Connection instructions </h2><br>  <em>I want to notice in advance the fact that we do not work with individuals, so even if you decide, but you do not have a legal entity, I recommend to get it, but I think most of the information resources are already registered as a legal entity.</em> <br><br><h3>  First step </h3><br>  Go to the website <a href="https://www.lead4crm.ru/">Lead4CRM.ru</a> and log in. <br><br>  How do you find yourself in your personal account, scroll down to the list of tabs and open the ‚ÄúReferral program‚Äù tab. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/064/eda/4c9/064eda4c98f34773a7f8f7cdeaa50af0.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In the opened tab there will be a short registration form in which you need to specify the minimum information about your company with which the contract will be concluded. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c1c/787/da0/c1c787da0be04879ac7396fd9d7c57c4.png" alt="image"><br><br>  When you fill out this form and send a request, the manager will process your data, enter the remaining legal details and you will receive a notification email that your service allowed you to receive at the first authorization using any of the social accounts. <br><br>  In the event that it turned out that you were not allowed to receive an email address at the first authorization, then you need to specify this address in advance.  This can be done in another tab: "Notifications".  There you need to find the section ‚ÄúE-mail‚Äù and in the empty line ‚ÄúE-mail‚Äù enter the e-mail address and click save, thus you will add the e-mail. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/829/bb0/f32/829bb0f3245e47c699f57af402a36413.png" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Second step </h3><br>  After receiving the notification of the completion of the processing of your data, you need to confirm the specified data and accept the agreement agreement. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/203/19a/c3d/20319ac3df1e41a6bb074279c216350b.png" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Third step </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4f7/4ce/cc5/4f74cecc558d4283a493d2f96fad9c54.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Now everything is ready to work with the referral program, however, there is an interesting point - you can use the standard referral link and place it on your resource (standard), or you can provide links to materials about our service, and in published materials just make regular links to Our resource without a referral component, for this you need: <br><br><ol><li>  Add a link to the material. </li><li>  Open this material and follow one of the links to our site. </li><li>  Wait until the moderator checks and approves your link. </li></ol><br>  This is a long process, but in some cases it gives its advantage, since  Sometimes someone does not want to click on the referral link so that no one earns on it - nonsense, but there is a precedent. <br><br><h2>  Epilogue </h2><br>  The program is completely ready, all the moments seem to be thought out, but still the question remains as to what you would like, write your suggestions in the comments or you can write directly to the email: <a href="">help@lead4crm.ru</a> . <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299140/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299140/</a></p>
