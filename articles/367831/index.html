The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow to make parking interesting was suggested by the room itself - it strongly resembles the Half-Life setting.  Without thinking twice, we decided to pay tribute to our beloved game, and as a result we had a wonderful neighbor.  For us, he is not some kind of decor element, but a childhood friend is not the kindest, but damn charming.  Today we will talk about his "inner world", the method of attachment to the ceiling and why he does not have tongue and mucus. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Our domesticated alien weighs about 15 kilograms, its length is almost a meter.  Determining its dimensions, they were repelled by the ratio of the dimensions of the barnacle and Dr. Kleiner in the game.  For greater safety, the parking visitor who was left behind had to deprive the representative of the fauna of the world Zen.  Language is also missing for the greater ergonomics of this art object, because a tentacle hanging from the ceiling at the turn of the parking would interfere with movement. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1ac/633/633/1ac633633fda4351b36638d9b0cb7df0.jpg">

      Barnacle is made of polyester resin and fiberglass.  Ceramic powder was added to the resin for added strength.  The basis for the predator was a block of foam, which was gradually cut off and burned to create the form and study the internal space.  Then the foam stuck to the clay, which was held on a frame of wooden slats and cables.  After removing the form and creating the texture of the skin, the form was removed from the sculpture with the help of silicone - it took quite a lot.  The rigidity of the form provided a gypsum casing with fiberglass. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/589/e78/e79/589e78e797f342eca3ec3df6315c6279.JPG"><br><br>  To create a dummy alien had to stock an abandoned factory: workshop owners feared toxic materials and refused to provide the room.  We know that after styrene leaves the resin base, the casting becomes completely inert.  Only dust that was everywhere during grinding was toxic: even seemingly harmless working with gypsum without respiratory protection could cause asthma. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4ff/a8a/e41/4ffa8ae417e84cc99aabb30c649cf40e.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/85f/845/a5d/85f845a5d3c44c80808554be78daa9b5.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/42b/aa8/bdc/42baa8bdcd0e43379828acc6f9c24df5.JPG"><br><br>  Silicone clots could add balsam and glitter to the barnacle, but they quickly collect dust and in time would look like gray jelly.  In the manufacture of mucus is nothing complicated, but it would be out of place in the parking lot. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/562/1bb/a1b/5621bba1b9894b02a259c2d649238971.jpg"><br><br>  Matt acrylic was used for painting, because a barnacle in gloss would hardly look natural.  Perhaps after painting it was worth making a couple of accents with a spray paint, but we love barnacle for what it is. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9cb/bf1/4dc/9cbbf14dc7e941fea37503163b3e0306.jpg"><br><br>  In the depressions on the sides of the predator there are attachment points.  In order to fix the barnacle on the ceiling, 4 studs were hammered into the concrete overlap of the parking lot, so that such happiness would not fall on anyone's head. <br><br>  Beginners with unaccustomed look around to avoid catching the eye of the tentaklu or bulskvidu.  Particularly impressionable visitors can arm themselves with a special crowbar - yes, we save ammunition.  I am glad that no one has used a crowbar for its intended purpose. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4a7/769/e75/4a7769e756d74e769afe109264b7e89e.jpg"><br><br>  Not a single barnacle, we pay tribute to the Half-Life series of games.  The parking lot also has the logo of the Black Mesa research complex and an interactive medbox.  If you approach it, it emits characteristic sounds and gives out a bottle of mineral water. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a84/388/3e9/a843883e9b954493ba7e558f02c091a2.jpg"><br><br>  We, of course, cannot arrange a bowling with barnacles - the stranger in the parking spends time in proud solitude.  But we have a headcrab named Zhora, but that's another story. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/367831/">https://habr.com/ru/post/367831/</a></p>
