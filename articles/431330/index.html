We have a free online broadcast of some reports, so that on a day off, you can open YouTube on any suitable device (for example, to authenticate on a smartphone that you use in development) and learn something useful without leaving your favorite sofa. <br><br>  What kind of reports got into the open to all part?  And what will happen at the conference such that the broadcast will not fall?  All descriptions and treasured link - under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The broadcast will be broadcast live all Saturday (opening at 9:45, the last report ends at 19:30).  After the end, it will remain available on YouTube as a record, so you can watch it later.  Consider only one caveat: after completing the long hours of broadcasting, youtube for a couple of days only gives you a look at the first few hours of it, and only then it will have more and more access.  So if you want to share the pleasure between Saturday and Sunday, leave the morning reports on Sunday.

      Here is the <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/onlinefree/">link</a> , but what reports from this link can be seen: <br><br><hr><br>  <b>10:30</b> <br><h2>  Fast and beautiful: Modern image delivery techniques </h2><br>  <b>Doug sillars</b> <br>  <b>iOS / Android</b> <br><br>  Doug Sillars is known as the author of the book ‚ÄúHigh Performance Android Apps‚Äù, but this opening English-speaking speech is intended for all conference viewers, so there will be no attachment to Android (the word ‚Äúweb‚Äù appears in the description of the report).  Probably, users of your service upload images, and everything seems to be working.  But does this mean that there is nothing to strive for?  Mobile Internet is still far from perfect, and images still make up the majority of mobile traffic - how can you optimize their delivery? <br><br><hr><br>  <b>12:00</b> <br><h2>  Lord of the modules </h2><br>  <b>Alexander Blinov</b> <br>  <b>Android</b> <br><br>  And here the binding to the platform is already there.  Many Android developers are well aware of Alexander‚Äôs voice: he is one of the leading Android Dev Podcasts.  And here you can see it with reports on the modules.  In conditions when a team of a popular application can grow by an order of magnitude over time, the need to divide it becomes very acute - how exactly do this? <br><br>  At the previous Mobius there was already a report ‚ÄúMulti-Modular Architecture of the Project‚Äù, but this one will be different both meaningfully (less affected parties will be covered) and stylistically: Alexander is going to start from the ‚ÄúLord of the Rings‚Äù. <br><br><hr><br>  <b>13:30</b> <br><h2>  Android builds at Lyft </h2><br>  <b>Artyom Zinnatullin</b> <br>  <b>Android</b> <br><br>  Another notable android podcaster: Artyom is known from the Context podcast and from many other things (for example, at the recent Android Dev Summit, his question <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/9y807z/stephanie_cuthbertson_how_many_people_would_be/e9zmoha/">initiated a</a> Google discussion on whether to publish AndroidX on GitHub).  So it makes sense to connect regardless of how much you are interested in assembly issues - it is interesting to listen to Artyom by itself (of course, conference visitors are in an advantageous position who can ask him about other topics, but the report is better than nothing). <br><br>  However, the topic is also interesting, because it is based on personal experience in Lyft - and not every one of us works on an application of this magnitude. <br><br><hr><br>  <b>3:30 pm</b> <br><h2>  Squeeze your swift </h2><br>  <b>Paul Hudson</b> <br>  <b>iOS</b> <br><br>  And now a holiday on Yabloneva street.  And here again, as in the opening speech will be discussed about "doing something better than now."  If you are not working on iOS in some terrible law, then you probably already write on Swift, and in general, the tasks are performed - but do you write on it as well as you could?  Is it possible to make your code smarter and more reliable by limiting yourself? <br><br>  Paul Hudson believes that yes, and intends to share this.  And who knows about this, as not the creator of the site Hacking with Swift and the author of a number of books on iOS development? <br><br><hr><br>  <b>5:00 pm</b> <br><h2>  Make mobile apps fast again </h2><br>  <b>Ilya Bogin</b> <br>  <b>iOS / Android</b> <br><br>  Performance characteristics are such a thing that you cannot just work on them once and how to optimize everything, and then forget about it forever.  Any subsequent update of the application can take and spoil the picture, and it is not always obvious that ‚Äúeverything began to slow down like hell‚Äù: will you notice an increase in energy consumption?  In general, if in general, these characteristics concern you, then you need to constantly monitor that they do not subside.  How then to embed it in CI, and what difficulties will you encounter on the path of tracking regressions?  Thanks to work on a mobile Yandex Browser, Ilya Bogin knows - and now you can also find out. <br><br><hr><br>  <b>18:30</b> <br><h2>  Kotlin puzzlers, vol.  2 </h2><br>  <b>Anton Keks</b> <br>  <b>Android / iOS</b> <br><br>  Although iOS developers do not really care about Kotlin, I would like to advise them too.  First, it is partly entertaining.  Secondly, since Kotlin and Swift sometimes overlap, it will be possible to equalize their behavior in similar situations.  And thirdly, Kotlin / Native is gradually developing and is going to declare itself on iOS, so do not blame Kotlin! <br><br>  Puzzle players are cases where a language behaves in a non-intuitive way, and you can have a great time trying to understand what will happen in a particular case.  Last year, Anton has already spoken on Mobius with a set of Kotlin-puzzlers, and now it's time for the second part - you can still watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DmKnY_uI3Z9Q">first one</a> and decide. <br><br><hr><br>  Between presentations we have long breaks when the audience of the conference can properly ask the speakers in the discussion areas.  And what to do in the breaks to those who watch the broadcast?  For them we are going to interview speakers. <br><br><hr><br>  For all of the above, it may seem "Why bother to go to the conference at all if you can see interesting reports at home in real time, at least in the record."  Therefore, after listing what is in the program, we also mention what is not in it: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>All other reports</b> .  In an open broadcast, one day and one hall, and only two days at the conference and three halls, so the content is many times more.  If you want to get all this, but do not want to get up from the couch, there are <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/registration/">tickets</a> to the paid version of the broadcast with access to everything at once. </li><li>  <b>Discussion areas</b> .  After his report, each speaker does not just answer questions from the audience for five minutes, but moves to where he can ask more details (and not necessarily on the topic of the report). </li><li>  <b>Stands of companies</b> .  There is a lot of its movement - small tech talks, contests, communication with the developers of these companies. </li><li>  <b>BOF session</b> .  At the end of the first day, two lively discussions will take place in parallel with the participation of speakers and all interested spectators.  One is about work / life balance and burnout, the other is about job interviews.  In general, when after a full day of reports it will be difficult to understand technical terms, it will be possible to properly discuss less technical, but also important. </li><li>  <b>Party</b>  Even at the end of the first day, there will be music, beer and desktops - so even those who find it difficult to initiate a conversation in a more formal setting will be able to communicate. </li></ul><br>  I want to end with the word ‚Äúsee you‚Äù, but if you watch the broadcast, we will not see you, only you will see us.  Well, it means, show up! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/431330/">https://habr.com/ru/post/431330/</a></p>
