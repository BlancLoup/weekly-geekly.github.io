However, the days pass, and the attendance still strives for minus infinity.  What to do? <br><br>  <strong>Who participates in the communities?</strong>

      Any community consists of three categories of users.  Some create (or publish) content, others comment on the posts of other users, and still others do not bother themselves with either the other, but they read the posts and comments already left.  In addition, there is a fourth subcategory - the creators of the resource (Higher Forces). <br><br>  According to rough estimates, in ordinary thematic communities the first category (who writes posts) is 0.1% of the target audience of the resource, the second (writes comments) - 1% and the third (the most useless - only reads) - 98.9%.  Consequently, in order for a new resource to appear and expand, constant communication is necessary either to attract a large number of target audiences at a time, or to make part of the passive audience take notes and leave comments.  How to make the audience communicate? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>1. The leader of opinions.</strong> <br><br>  The path that many communities take is to engage a leader of opinions.  Minus the way - serious financial costs.  The advantage of the method is that the famous person guarantees the attraction of the target audience, communication in his posts and wide pr-fame in runet.  Examples include ‚ÄúThe Secret of the Firm‚Äù with a Chichvarkin column, sports sites that attract the commentator Utkin, etc. Many people like the effect of the work of famous people, but I don‚Äôt want to pay money.  Then the project creators decide to take the user for a fool, agree to write posts on his behalf with a star and get scandal and outflow of the audience in response. <br><br>  <strong>2. Freebie</strong> <br><br>  One of the reflex functions of the human body is a pathological desire for freebies.  What a blessing for you that you can easily give users a little of this substance!  Some kind of prize (possible and not monetary, for example, acquaintance with the beauty-sister of the author of the project :)) - and users will do whatever they want to get it.  It is better if the prize is difficult to reach (for example, a supernovae cell phone model that is not yet sold in Russia (I haven't hinted at anything). <br><br>  <strong>3. Power</strong> <br><br>  After a freebie, people love power and a sense of self-worth most of all.  The community has the power to give them what they need.  The introduction of the rating and its increase for any action on the site will increase communication at times.  Most of all, rating should be influenced by writing posts, comments are in second place, and profile fill factor is in third place.  You can also give fractions of rating points for navigating through pages or clicking on contextual advertising links to return at least part of the funds or recoup your own contextual advertising (but it's not fair :(). And if you assign a serious prize for achieving a certain number of rankings, then the effect will be increased at times. <br><br>  For example, in Ya.ru, the one who scores 100 rating points is promised to give the opportunity to correct the posts of other users.  It is clear, however, that it will be simply impossible to score 100 rating points, or a Yandex employee will be the first to score them. <br><br>  Power is also expressed in enabling the user to actually participate in the project.  For example, change the site based on user voting, organize contests for the best improvement for the project, etc. <br><br>  <strong>4. Disputes</strong> <br><br>  After freebies and power, the main thing for a person in the community is his unsurpassed mind.  A person loves his own brain and himself personally more than anyone in the world.  And it is very bad when others are not aware of its greatness.  In your power to give a person a chance to express themselves.  The key to fueling controversy is the initial content.  This should be a thoughtful, subjective, written by you note on a sore subject relevant to the target audience of your project.  It is desirable that supporters and opponents of your "opinion" was exactly 50:50.  Then the disputes in this post (provided that it is possible to receive answers to the user's message by email) will not be silenced for years. <br><br>  Let us return to the examples from the previous post about the community for young mothers or women who are going to give birth and try to come up with several headlines for such topics.  Oh yes: when creating a creation of scandalous topics in the community, forget about the concept of morality.  And to calm your conscience, end the discussion with a ‚Äúvictory‚Äù of the ‚Äúright‚Äù part of the audience.  In the end, do not forget that you are working for users;  for their good and pleasure :) <br><br>  <strong>A community of young moms or women who will soon become moms.</strong> <br><br>  1. I want a child, but my husband does not want.  What to do? <br><br>  2. We have three children, we want a fourth, and we live on two scholarships of 500 rubles.  each <br><br>  3. Hire a nanny or stay at home? <br><br>  <strong>Winter sports community:</strong> <br><br>  1. Help with the choice!  Which is better, ski or snowboard? <br><br>  <strong>Motorists community:</strong> <br><br>  1. What to buy?  New fret or second-hand "Japanese"?  (The example is not entirely good, because everything is clear already). <br><br>  <strong>Politics community</strong> (another real example: discussions are still ongoing, although the post was published in 2004): <br><br>  1. In Moscow, wages are 10 times more than in Russia! <br><br><br>  These are just some of the strategic measures that will help you in creating a community for communication (and not for taking up space on the Internet).  Unfortunately, these measures are almost never dispensed with, although some methods may seem unnecessary or controversial. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/20335/">https://habr.com/ru/post/20335/</a></p>
