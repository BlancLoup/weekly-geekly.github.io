Preparing for the delivery of the third group of electrical safety</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I continue to publish materials on the category of electrical safety.  This article is a continuation of my <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/176219/">previous post</a> , where the surrender to group II was considered. <br>  As it turned out, the materials for the surrender of group III are slightly supplemented materials for the surrender of group II.  All admission groups are based on the same regulatory documents, questions and manuals.  In order not to duplicate information, in this article I cite only what is necessary for putting on group III, and what was not in the previous article.  Under a cat regulatory documents, it is a little about preparation and questions with the correct answers.  To prepare for surrender to group III, you need to familiarize yourself not only with this article, but also with the previous one.  You need to take it as an addition.  Ducks are present, but few. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6ae/dc5/3f1/6aedc53f14cd587064d26408961a70ca.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Regulations </h4><br>  Let's look at the legal framework.

The instruction was approved by the Department of Research and Educational Medical Institutions of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation and recommended for training persons who do not have medical education, but are obliged to be able to provide first emergency medical assistance (letter N 16-16 / 68 dated June 28, 1999). <br></div></div><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f84/595/1f4/f845951f4f8ae6c298d04a677274364c.jpg"><br><br>  Obviously, they are supplemented or revised extremely rarely. <br><br><h4>  How to prepare, the process of putting </h4><br>  At enterprises where the Labor Code of the Russian Federation is observed, personnel working with various electrical installations (computer in particular) will have to take the group, at least II. <br>  I'm getting ready on the system <div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Anti-advertising.</b>  <b class="spoiler_title">I do not blame anyone, but ...</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  OLIMPOX </div></div>  The process of preparation is reduced to the resolution of exam questions.  If the answer is incorrect, the reference to the explanation leads straight to the huge regulatory documents (listed in the previous paragraph, there is no navigation, of course, no references; neither are there any brief references).  At enterprises, such systems are needed <s>(are they needed?)</s> To automate the delivery and accounting of ‚Äúpassed / not passed‚Äù.  Given the above, and its cost for large companies - in my humble opinion, the system is useless.  Documents and free can be read. <br>  Delivery takes place in two stages - testing on any system (even on the on-line service, there are free, recently found paid), or in writing, and an oral conversation with the engineer on TB.  The conversation is not always held. <br><br>  The problem of studying for a group is that there are several huge documents that are required to learn (and it is convenient to sleep only for them), and a formal approach to passing.  Testing does not cover everything you need to know, does not structure knowledge.  In addition, the employer is sometimes interested in having the employee start work as soon as possible, and the EB team is required for the employee to be allowed to do this work. <br>  The real benefits of this approach are few. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0dd/d9a/47b/0ddd9a47bc85020880175e46011ef9fd.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Questions ticket with the correct answers.  Split on 7 themes in spoilers </h4><br>  There were 151 questions for the surrender of group II 113, and 151 for the surrender of group III. Many questions (but not all) from group II moved to the surrender of group III.  Many new ones have been added.  As before, the questions are harsh, similar to the EGE, but occasionally there is useful information. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Topic 1.
