The company has compiled lists of the most downloaded and earning apps and companies. <br><br>  Interesting data in Russia, because all the games after a change in exchange rates experienced a drop in revenues.  Top most earned games in the AppStore and Google Play looks like this:

      1.Clash of Clans <br>  2.Game of War <br>  3.World of Tanks <br><br>  Most downloaded applications: <br><br>  1.VK <br>  2.Talking Tom <br>  3.Viber <br><br>  See the full index, you can <a href="http://www.appannie.com/indexes/all-stores/rank/overall/%3Fmonth%3D2014-12-01%26country%3DRU">link</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  New rules for Google Play </h4><br>  Google added to the application naming rules with a clarification that the name should not begin with a foreign brand.  That is, for Hyundai Turnlights Conserver (the idea for the original application from the future, full of applications for cars, does not allow you to turn on the blinkers) can be punished, and for Turnlights Conserver for Hyundai will not be. <br><br>  The original explanation can be seen <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/2985717">here</a> when opening the item.  The introduction of this change is explained by the fact that with a quick superficial reading of the program name from a third-party developer, a false association may arise that the application is original for the specified brand.  In addition, they say that most of the time a foreign brand in the name of sin applications for social networks, and here and close to phishing. <br><br><br><h4>  Apple patents a joystick iPhone </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b11/9b6/6ef/b119b66ef4d340dfbc70dcce0cb2c54b.jpg"><br><br>  The other day it became <a href="http://kanobu.ru/news/apple-zapatentovala-iphone-so-vstroennyim-dzhojstikom-375334/">known</a> that the Coopertin company patented a telephone with an integrated joystick.  The patent has been pending since July 2013, and only recently has the bureau registered the patent. <br><br>  As you can see in the image, another mode will appear at the Home button - it will be able to rise above the body and thus serve as a rather familiar and familiar stick for all gamers. <br><br>  Already more than once, companies have taken attempts to make management on smartphones more functional, and one cannot say that their attempts are unsuccessful.  There are many options for special joysticks-adapters for tablets and phones that you can buy, but these solutions do not differ in elegance, compactness and obviously will not be able to conquer the mass market.  But Apple, apparently, has every chance. <br><br>  This solution will make it possible for many players to get a way to control in the usual configuration of the phone and allow them to fully enjoy the games.  Also, with the mass availability of such a solution, it can be stated that the core and hardcore games on the mobile platform will receive new fans for themselves, it remains to wait for announcements and see how the camp of Android phone manufacturers will respond to this. <br><br><br><h4>  The shelf of publishers has arrived. </h4><br>  Almost simultaneously, two Russian companies <a href="http://app2top.ru/industry/nekki-zapuskaet-novuyu-indi-intsiativu-i-anonsiruet-pervy-j-proekt-49897.html">Nekki</a> and <a href="http://app2top.ru/industry/zeptolab-stanovitsya-izdatelem-50074.html">Zeptolab</a> announced that they would try their hand at publishing.  The decision on their part is quite logical: both companies have a sufficient amount of traffic, on which you can earn good money.  If you believe the statements of Nekki, then they will not only pump up traffic, but also help with the development of the game itself, but also very thoughtful about the choice of projects for publication. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want to be strongly dispersed - we have plans to work with two or three projects for 2015.  We do not plan to collect a huge portfolio of projects.  Lower the entry bar - too.  If we do not understand the game shown or do not like the genre (that is, we are unlikely to give useful advice to the developers), then we simply won‚Äôt take it, ‚Äùsaid Sergey Babayev, development director at Nekki. <br><br>  There are no details about Zeptolab‚Äôs plans, but I think they will be similar to Nekki‚Äôs comments. <br>  Friends, this is a good chance for everyone who makes their game, but is afraid to enter the market on their own! <br><br><br><h4>  Roskomnadzor VS Steam </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ee5/e0a/147/ee5e0a14760043518a37d28d0bce5f27.jpg"><br><br>  What everyone was so afraid of was <a href="http://kanobu.ru/news/roskomnadzor-vnes-steam-v-reestr-zapreschennyih-sajtov-375402/">nearly fulfilled</a> , but apparently it was a joke.  I'd like to hope that it will remain a joke. <br><br>  ‚ÄúDue to the spread of information about drugs, the well-known digital distribution service of computer games and Steam programs has got into the single register of prohibited sites.‚Äù  Such text was published on the Roskomnadzor page on VKontakte. <br><br>  The writing style is somewhat puzzling, especially the part where they offer everyone to help Roskomnadzor to connect with Steam.  On the RKN Steam website, the lists are not listed, and so far everything is working. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/249155/">https://habr.com/ru/post/249155/</a></p>
