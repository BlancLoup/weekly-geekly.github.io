  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Announcement: Veeam Backup & Replication 9.5 (and beyond) new features</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In this quarter, Veeam plans to release Update 3 for the version of Veeam Backup &amp; Replication 9.5, and then its anniversary, 10th version will follow.  This is our well-known flagship product for protecting data in a virtual environment, but recently, solutions for physical machines are also gaining popularity: the Veeam Agent for Microsoft Windows and the Veeam Agent for Linux. <br><br>  Naturally, the number of users who want to work with backups of virtual and physical machines is growing using a single console.  Therefore, our engineers decided to implement this feature in Veeam Backup &amp; Replication, without delaying them, and I will tell you about it today.  For details, welcome under cat. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/db/b6/59dbb6252ba60664395698.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I'll start with the look.  Since Veeam Backup &amp; Replication will now work with both virtual and physical machines, it was decided to bring the <b>Inventory</b> section that previously lived in the <b>VMs view</b> into a separate view.  It will display all machines protected by Veeam, whether it is Veeam Backup &amp; Replication or any of the Veeam Agents.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/dc/af/59dcaf8f05db2857031945.png"><br><br><h1>  Logical Containers Protection Groups </h1><br>  In order to provide the ability to control and configure protection through the console, you need to create the appropriate logical containers - the so-called <b>Protection Groups</b> - and then the necessary objects will be placed there. <br><br>  First of all, we deal with the type of objects for which we will configure protection.  In the <b>Type</b> step of the wizard to create a protective group, there are several options: <br><br><ol><li>  If we want to place individual computers into a container (group), we assign the type of <b>Individual computers to a</b> group.  We get a static association (the changes are not picked up on the fly), in which computers can be added by specifying their IP address or domain name.  Such groups are recommended to be used for small infrastructures where the Active Directory domain is not configured. </li><li>  If we want to have a dynamic group where we will place Microsoft Active Directory objects - we assign the group the type <b>Microsoft Active Directory objects</b> .  This is a container of a dynamic type, where objects will automatically fall after being enabled, for example, in the Active Directory OU or security group.  It is recommended to use such groups for infrastructures of any size working with Active Directory. </li><li>  If you have a rather large infrastructure, but you do not use Active Directory, or you have set up integration with CMDB, it is recommended to use protective groups that are replenished through the list of computers imported from a CSV file - <b>Computers from CSV file</b> . </li></ol><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/db/b6/59dbb624cb769594673384.png"><br><br>  Since organizations most likely will use groups for Active Directory objects, we‚Äôll focus on them in more detail first. <br><br>  If you selected the type of <b>Microsoft Active Directory objects</b> protection group, Veeam Backup &amp; Replication server will automatically request information about the Active Directory structure of your home domain and display it. <br><br>  <i>Note:</i> You can change the default setting and display as a selection area, for example, a subdomain or another domain in general.  You can also exclude individual objects from the selection area ‚Äî for example, you can exclude computer counts that were turned off during the last month, or you can exclude an entire OU. <br><br>  So, we have indicated what area of ‚Äã‚Äãchoice our AD objects will be from.  Veeam will install the <i><b>Veeam Agent</b></i> executable on these objects, which, in fact, will perform backups.  Of course, to install agents, the Veeam Backup Service account must have appropriate permissions. <br><br>  Then you need to specify how often we want to scan our selection area - this entity is dynamic, that is, as soon as new objects are found during the next scan, they will immediately be included in their protective group. <br><br>  In the scan options (Step <b>Options</b> ) for a group of any type, you can choose whether we want the Veeam Agent to be automatically placed on the newly discovered objects - if we want, then we check the <b>Install backup agent automatically (recommended)</b> checkbox: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/db/b6/59dbb624bbda3319698121.png"><br><br><h1>  Backup </h1><br>  After we have properly grouped our computers, we set up a backup for them using an agent.  To do this, select the desired protective group and create a new task for it (or include it in an existing one). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/db/b6/59dbb6252ba60664395698.png"><br><br><h3>  Job type </h3><br>  Depending on what machines we want to process, choose the type of task.  It may be: <br><br><ul><li>  Working page - then choose the option <b>Workstation</b> </li><li>  Server - choose, of course, <b>Server</b> </li><li>  And - by popular demand of the user audience!  - <b>Failover Cluster</b> </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/db/b6/59dbb6256770f319588575.png"><br><br><h3>  Job control mode </h3><br>  At the same step, it is necessary to decide in which mode the agent responsible for backup will work.  Depending on which type of protected machine was selected, either both or one of two options will be available: <br><br><ul><li>  Centralized control from the server side Veeam backup ( <b>Managed by backup server</b> ). <br>  If this mode was chosen, then a lightweight version of the Veeam Agent will be installed on the machines - without a GUI, without a local configuration database.  All settings will need to be done on the server Veeam backup server. <br><br>  In this embodiment, the server monitors all work, including remote start and stop the job, view statistics, etc. <br><br>  This mode is convenient for backup machines that are always connected to the infrastructure.  It will always be assigned for the backup of clusters, and will also be an option for the backup of servers. </li><li>  Control over the task is performed by the agent ( <b>Managed by agent</b> ). <br>  If you select this mode, then the full version of the Veeam Agent will be installed on the machines. <br>  All schedule settings and task management are performed on the side of the agent itself. <br>  This mode is convenient for backup machines, for which it is not always possible to provide a permanent connection to the infrastructure via a good channel, but for which, nevertheless, it is necessary to fulfill the RPO requirements.  He will always be assigned to the backup of workstations, and will also be an option for the backup of servers. </li></ul><br><h3>  Create a backup with running applications </h3><br>  At the <b>Guest Processing</b> step, you can specify that the backup should be created taking into account applications running on the machine (application consistency).  The following applications are supported: <br><br><ul><li>  SQL Server, including support for Always-On Groups, </li><li>  Oracle </li><li>  Exchange, including DAG support </li><li>  Active Directory </li><li>  SharePoint </li></ul><br>  To restore the objects of these applications from the backup, you can use the tools from the line of Veeam Explorers. <br><br>  For SQL and Oracle databases, transaction log backups will be supported - to be able to recover to the selected point in time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/db/b6/59dbb624f0c8d674756888.png"><br><br><br><h1>  Invitation to VeeamON Forum Russia 2017 </h1><br>  Yes, yes, this year we invite our readers and all those interested in participating in the <a href="https://go.veeam.com/veeamon-forum-russia">VeeamON Forum 2017 Russia</a> forum dedicated to the issues of data accessibility.
