For example, I ‚Äúgot caught‚Äù and decided that Shareaza had just undergone a lot of changes ... <br><br>  So, since December 2007, the <a href="http://shareaza.com/">shareaza.com</a> site <a href="http://shareaza.com/">is</a> no longer the official site of the well-known file-sharing client Shareaza.  At the moment, the site is a fake for the client‚Äôs site, which is familiar to users.  The counterfeit is so reliable that the inexperienced user decides that an easy redesign has taken place on the site, and the program itself has just slightly changed its functionality. <br><br>  The site offers to download the <b>Shareaza4</b> client, which has nothing to do with the original client and does not even have functions for working with p2p networks (eDonkey, Gnutella, BitTorrent).  Moreover, the program is aimed at the commercial provision of services; you will be prompted to enter a credit card number in order to subsequently pay for some of the functions of the ‚Äúnew‚Äù service.

      The original Shareaza is now located at: <a href="http://shareaza.sourceforge.net/">http://shareaza.sourceforge.net/</a> <br><br>  Everyone is recommended to upgrade to Shareaza version 2.3.1.0, since previous versions are being updated from the site shareaza.com, which no longer belongs to the creators of shareware.  Upgrading previous versions may lead to the fact that you end up with a completely different client. <br><br>  And yet, what happened to the shareaza.com domain? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Initially, the domain belonged to Shareaza p2p client creator Michael Stokes.  At the time of the creation of this client, he was unemployed.  After he declared himself, releasing Shareazu, he was offered a job.  In this regard, he was forced to leave Shareaza and put it in open access (open source), transferring the domain to a person trustworthy in his opinion - Jonathan Nelson. <br><br>  Nelson managed the domain for several years.  However, he later became the only one who could be held accountable (and had to be responsible) for the activities of Shareaza in the face of the SPPF (La Societe Des Producteurs De Phonogrammes En France - Society of Record Producers of France).  After that, Jonathan Nelson "went to the bottom", stopping all communication with the team of Shareazy.  Nelson has now lost all ties with the Shareaz development team and is not part of it and will not be such in the future (the developers believe). <br><br>  It was further reported that the shareaza.com domain was ‚Äúhijacked‚Äù and is no longer controlled by Jonathan Nelson.  Now the domain is controlled by MusicLab, which miraculously is an SPPF partner.  Nelson neither confirms nor denies that the domain has been sold, but it is rumored that the sale of the domain to MusicLab could have taken place after reaching an agreement with the prosecution that the case against Nelson would be discontinued. <br><br>  MusicLab also gained control over the resource of another file-sharing client, BearShare.  Those.  There is evidence that MusicLab aims to gain control over some P2P resources. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/21119/">https://habr.com/ru/post/21119/</a></p>
