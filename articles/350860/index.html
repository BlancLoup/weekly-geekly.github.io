Usually, under such devices, we imagine portable electronic devices, home appliances and audiovisual equipment.  However, car manufacturers have entered the game, and now they are using the market for their own purposes. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Wi-Fi, which captured the automotive field, has opened up completely new possibilities - the machines use a direct internet connection to navigate through GPS, access email and listen to music online.  According to the analyst‚Äôs report on the market for connected cars, by 2020 the cost of services in this area will be about $ 40 billion a year.

      What is included in these services?  This is a huge range of services, which includes information and entertainment systems, navigation, transport logistics, remote diagnostics, automatic accident notifications, enhanced security capabilities, usage-based insurance (that is, based on a real analysis of vehicle use), management traffic and finally autopilot.  The foundation for all these applications is Big Data.  The whole process begins with the fact that more and more data is collected from remote sensors, and then this information is interpreted and used to transform the automotive industry into a sphere using two A: automation and autonomy. <br><br><h4>  Big data and connected cars </h4><br>  In fact, implementing big data in the automotive industry is easy and does not take much time.  This is due to the fact that many modern cars already use advanced technologies that include numerous sensors, embedded computing tools and processors.  The only difference is that at the moment information is generated and stored locally, and in connected cars, the Internet will guarantee the timely update of all applications and transfer of information to the right place. <br><br>  The main feature of course will be that car manufacturers will be able to remotely update the software of the car, taking into account all the characteristics of the car.  For example, if the car has time to change the oil or the fluid in the radiator is running out, the manufacturer will be able to inform the driver about this remotely.  The execution of personal files is also noticeably simpler: on the way home from work, you will be able to answer emails, check online banking and pay bills. <br><br>  Since big data is information gathered from multiple data sources, it is possible to make a conclusion about consumer behavior based on their analysis.  For example, it is possible to establish whether there is a link between the musical preferences of users and frequently visited restaurants.  In turn, data analysis can significantly affect the distribution of advertising resources and budget.  We can safely say that the information collected from connected cars is invaluable for commercial purposes. <br><br>  Let's talk about logistics.  The use of connected cars and big data (their analysis and aggregation) will allow you to manage a huge number of vehicles.  Sensors will inform stakeholders about the speed, methods of braking, routes, and, taking into account all these data, we can make informed decisions, which will then be transferred to drivers.  And if a car with the help of intelligent sensory algorithm will be able to independently propose solutions and the best solutions to situations, then this will generally be an ideal option. <br><br>  Change and approach the maintenance of vehicles - to the forefront rather preventive measures rather than measures to respond to the situation.  Monitoring of all systems will allow identifying and fixing possible problems before they lead to breakdown. <br><br>  A huge amount of information comes from connected highways in the United States of America and other countries.  Based on the analysis of the data obtained, especially data on the construction and reconstruction of roads, accidents and intersections, the connected car will be able to navigate more efficiently, and engineers can use this data to design roads and road logistics in accordance with real traffic.  As a result, we will get more efficient and safer roads. <br><br>  A huge array of big data can be extremely useful for insurance companies, and they are ready to apply this information in practice.  Using data from smart sensors about driver behavior and car use, insurers can benefit from custom customized insurance plans and offers.  Already, insurance companies offer discounts based on the analysis of driving their client.  And thanks to the large data, the disclosure of not only the fact, but also the essence of the accident will become more accurate and subjective, since it will be possible to reproduce the details on the basis of the data obtained.  Plus, data collection and subsequent analysis will force customers to drive more carefully and, therefore, again we are talking about improving road safety.  And it will be a great result of the application of new technologies, because  safety is paramount. <br><br><h4>  Big data and drones </h4><br>  Using autopilot is undoubtedly an excellent prospect.  According to analysts, the use of autopilot can make our roads even safer.  Indeed, according to statistics, 90 percent of accidents on fatal roads are associated with human error.  But in order for the prospect to become a reality, an array of data, big data is needed.  Vehicles will be equipped with sensors that measure all parameters: from location, speed, driving direction and braking, to traffic lights and nearby cars, pedestrian traffic and dangerous situations.  Using this data, the car can make the correct decision and take the appropriate action, which will be deprived of the human factor. <br><br>  The foundation has already been laid for an autonomous vehicle with the possibility of collision warnings, steering, braking assistance and speed control.  The use of information in real time affects the quality of driving.  The ability to control their own driving behavior together with preventive measures to prevent mechanical problems will help prevent all sorts of failures and predict the necessary maintenance in advance, and this in turn will help drivers save both time and money.  To provide analytics of this and storage of large amounts of data will allow <a href="https://vps.house/">VPS Windows</a> server on <b>VPS.house</b> , with the possibility of disk expansion up to 60TB.  In addition, cars will be able to adapt to their surroundings and conditions, as well as synchronize quickly with any changes in conditions. <br><br>  As the market for unmanned vehicle control grows, big data will increase and accumulate.  And this in turn serves as the basis for further progress in the automotive industry - after all, the more accumulated data, the greater the potential for autonomous technologies. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/350860/">https://habr.com/ru/post/350860/</a></p>
