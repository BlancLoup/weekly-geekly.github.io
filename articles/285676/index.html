It has passed.  Had time to drink a little more, the tragedy is inevitable. <br><br>  Common situation?  You are long and hard looking for a presenter at the corporate party, carefully describe the situation and the audience, discuss all the nuances of the performance, and he settles the village wedding.  Well, this is when everyone has to dance under Serdyuchka, hand over an oranges with his chin, get into the bottle with a pencil and feel each other blindfolded. <br><br>  This is how we celebrated March 8 a couple of years ago.  After that they decided that henceforth we will prepare the entertainment program only by ourselves.  And last New Year, the lot fell on me.  At that time I had to work hard and it would be extremely wrong for me not to share the experience I had gained.

      So, if you are in a similar situation now - this post is just for you.  Under the cut, the story of what I was preparing contests, and how the holiday was held as a result. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So.  There are 50 people.  Almost everyone from 25 to 30. Programmers, testers, designers, plus some analysts and managers.  All young, fun, educated and in due measure giknutnye.  Not the audience that hit the drunk "trickle of wallpaper." <br><br>  Unfortunately, finding a leader who shares this opinion is almost impossible.  Yes, and the Internet is replete with mostly similar scenarios.  So, I had to seriously scratch my turnips.  As a result, three thoughts were born about what should be the New Year's corporate in an IT company. <br><ul><li>  First, it is necessary to focus on the intellectual component of the competitions, to enable people to shine with resourcefulness and erudition, as well as to work with teams to solve various problems. </li><li>  Secondly, it is necessary, if possible, to use an IT theme, after all, we are all professionals in one area. </li><li>  And thirdly, it is necessary to arrange it so that by the middle of the evening the public will properly sound.  Then it will be a real jolly. </li></ul><br><br>  To implement my plan, I had to actively redo, adapt, and sometimes just invent contests myself.  And here is my recipe. <br><br><h3>  A and B </h3><br>  <b>Description:</b> The essence is simple - the leader pronounces a greeting phrase on the letter ‚ÄúA‚Äù.  Say, "And today I congratulate you on the New Year" and transmits the microphone to someone sitting next to him.  He should say congratulations on the letter "B".  For example, "Moreover, not just with the new, but with the year 2015!".  And so on.  It is recommended to persuade the next person after him in advance, and then the people themselves will figure it out. <br><br>  <b>Impressions:</b> I had this very first warm-up contest.  Immediately after the official congratulations of the leadership and the first toast.  The goal is not so much to entertain, how to warm up the audience, relieve stiffness and tension, set the tone for the whole subsequent party. <br><br>  I was surprised how well this topic went.  Even the most reserved guys who had never participated in anything before, gladly thought out their options. <br><br><h3>  Alcohol drink </h3><br>  <b>Description:</b> Depending on the size of the room, we take from 2 to 5 office chairs on wheels.  At the other end of the hall we put the appropriate number of bottles of beer / wine / vodka.  On each chair for two people.  One is sitting, the other is pushing.  The task of the first participant is to bring the second one to the bottle, pour two glasses and DO NOT SPLASH to take the glasses to the start, where they drink both a glass, change places and go further.  The winner is the team that quickly empties the bottle. <br><br>  <b>Impressions:</b> After the first contest, you can get a little distracted.  In our case, it was the presentation of certificates of honor for the past year.  Well, then it's time to drink a little.  And alcohol for this approach as any better. <br><br>  Unfortunately, I do not remember exactly what we played.  It seems to be a beer so that participants do not fall out of place on the drunk.  But I remember that everyone enjoyed driving on chairs so much that they asked to repeat the competition several more times. <br><br><h3>  Game of the program </h3><br>  <b>Description:</b> It's like a game in the city, but instead of the names of cities you need to use the names of computer programs.  Limitations: <br><ul><li>  Only software under DOS / Windows - otherwise the most endorsed Linux user will win </li><li>  Only with GUI - otherwise the admin who knows 2000 command line utilities will win </li><li>  Only in English - otherwise confusion will be </li><li>  Numbers are not part of the name - for the same reason. </li><li>  Version number or revision name is excluded from the title - for the same reason. </li><li>  Developer brand is ignored - that is, not Microsoft Office, but simply Office </li></ul><br>  Everybody plays.  Who lasted the longest, he won. <br><br>  <b>Impressions:</b> After the race you need to rest.  In general, it is better to alternate intensive contests with calm, alcoholic and intellectual contests and do not forget that there are tasks not just for volunteer teams, but for the entire hall as a whole.  The game of the program - just like that.  It was fun. <br><br><h3>  Alcodarts </h3><br>  <b>Description:</b> We take a couple of bottles of whiskey, or another strong alcohol, we buy alcodarts, hang them on the wall, and everyone is playing.  I note that shop alcodarts are usually on magnets, and this is not at all cool.  Therefore, I drew my own and stuck it on a dart target of the present. <br><br>  <b>Impressions:</b> This is a very cool contest, because it can last from 30 minutes to an hour, and all this time the leader is resting.  A company of 5 people plays by itself, another 5-10 people are watching.  The others eat, communicate with each other, listen to music, etc. Full relaxation. <br><br>  And according to the results, we have 5 more people thoroughly podshofe, plus the same after alcohol, which means the degree is steadily growing, and the audience is preparing for this annealing. <br><br>  We played darts all evening in parallel to the main program. <br><br><h3>  IT Alias </h3><br>  <b>Description:</b> Everyone knows Alias, right?  Take turns playing teams of 5-7 people.  The team has one explanation, the rest are deciphering.  Each is given a stack of cards with words.  Explaining takes a card, reads the word and explains it to the team, observing the rules.  The team guesses.  The tour lasts 3 minutes, then the next team.  In the end, we consider who solved the most cards. <br>  The difference between my alias was that all the words were from our subject area - server, ip-address, hyperlink, database, etc. <br><br>  <b>Impressions:</b> According to my impressions, it turned out to be one of the most successful contests.  The participants were already under a degree, stammered and forgot the previously familiar words.  It is very funny to see how a well-worn, bearded programmer tries to explain what RSS is.  The audience actually fell from laughter. <br><br><h3>  Sayings </h3><br>  <b>Description:</b> 3-5 people, each sheet of drawing paper and a bright marker, as well as a card with a famous saying.  In five minutes, players must portray the meaning of their sayings without using words and letters.  Then each artist presents his masterpiece to the hall, and all those present guess. <br><br>  <b>Impressions:</b> Calm relaxed competition.  The beauty is that viewers who guess the pictures also get their share of pleasure. <br><br><h3>  Who drinks vodka </h3><br>  <b>Description:</b> Choose from 4 to 6 people.  We take out transparent glasses, each has 100 grams (or 50 depending on the team) and a straw.  We announce that there is vodka in one glass and water in the rest.  The task of the participant of the competition is to drink the contents through a straw without showing emotions, i.e.  Do not let viewers understand that he is drinking.  The task of the audience is to guess which of the participants drank vodka. <br>  The trick is that in fact everyone has poured vodka. <br><br>  <b>Impressions:</b> As I recall, it went so-so. <br><br><h3>  Inverted phrases </h3><br>  <b>Description:</b> The leader of the evening calls proverbs and sayings in which each word is replaced by a word with the opposite meaning, and the people guess who is faster.  Examples: The new enemy is worse than the old three, The last pancakes are even, Happiness moves in heaps ... <br><br>  <b>Impressions:</b> Another warm-up game for all those present, just in case someone got bored. <br><br><h3>  Twister </h3><br>  <b>Description:</b> You just need to buy a twister.  You can beat the team, you can just play everything.  Fun. <br><br>  <b>Impressions:</b> By this time, the people are already completely warmed up and ready to anneal.  And the twister is the first annealing.  Next will be more fun.  We really liked, asked for more. <br><br><h3>  Russian roulette </h3><br>  <b>Description:</b> We take a few people, a plate and 6 eggs.  The host announces that the players must take turns breaking one egg on their foreheads, but one of them is raw, the rest are boiled, although in fact all boiled eggs are.  Tension increases with each next egg.  But it is desirable that there should be no more than five participants (they begin to guess that the eggs are all boiled). <br><br>  <b>Impressions:</b> It should have been very funny, but our first participant knocked over a plate with eggs. <br><br><h3>  Battle eggs </h3><br>  <b>Description:</b> Two participants enter the arena, a rope is hung on each belt, a bag is tied to a rope, and there are raw eggs in a bag.  The task of each - to break the opponent's eggs  You can not touch each other, you can only beat with bags of eggs. <br><br>  <b>Impressions:</b> This is our traditional annealing, tested many times. <br><br><h3>  Guess the frame </h3><br>  <b>Description:</b> Need a projector and screen.  We go to the film search, choose any rating of the best films, select and copy a more or less recognizable frame from each film.  Then we take 3-5 participants and arrange a quiz - who will be the first to name the movie.  The rest of the rules are at your discretion. <br><br>  <b>Impressions:</b> This contest was final for me when people are already tired and want to do something calm.  However, it was much more fun than I expected.  The hall is actively involved in the game and prompted the players. <br><br>  And finally - <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/56736877/alias.xlsx">here you have a file</a> with my cards for Alias ‚Äã‚Äãand proverbs for inverted phrases. <br><br>  Happy New Year! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285676/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285676/</a></p>
