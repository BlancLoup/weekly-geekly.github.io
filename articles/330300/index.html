      This is true: many providers default to 99.95% when it comes to accessibility.  But what needs to be done to get true numbers? <br><br>  Look at it this way: great advertising pushed you to buy a car, but when you make a deal you find a small asterisk next to the interest rate, obliging you to make a huge down payment.  The same thing happens with cloud SLAs. <br><br>  For example, the cloud provider ‚ÄúA‚Äù can have an SLA of 99.95%, but when you figure out the whole story, it turns out that this SLA corresponds to this level only if you perform certain actions.  For example, you may have to enter into contracts with provider "A" only in a few accessibility zones or buy them in certain aspects of your decision (by the way, both conditions increase your costs).  This is normal only if you planned to do so. <br><br>  On the other hand, the cloud provider ‚ÄúB‚Äù can give you an SLA of 99.95% without reference to the text: you just have an SLA of 99.95% for each virtual machine, and the period is clearly defined in the contract.  The SLA is fully responsible for them, and you don‚Äôt need to worry about changing the architecture of your system to be covered by the SLA. <br><br>  Therefore, if someone tells you that all cloud-based SLAs are the same, take out a magnifying glass, there may be an asterisk somewhere. <br><br>  <i>False # 2: Virtual machines (VMs) are much easier to use than physical servers.</i> <br><br>  As in any lie, there is some truth.  So, for example, a virtual machine is very easy to install, and you don‚Äôt have to go through this whole cycle with the purchase of servers and cabinets for them, installation and establishment of infrastructure for their activities.  And also, you can customize the operating system in an instant. <br><br>  However, the virtual machine is just an empty container.  After installing VM, the further work process is no different from working with a physical server.  You still have to deploy applications, set up your IT processes, and so on. <br><br>  <i>False # 3: Most companies move the entire data center to the cloud.</i> <br><br>  Small companies?  May be.  Medium and large companies?  Not.  They can move part of their data center to the cloud to make some IT operations more flexible and faster, but this very rarely happens with the entire data set. <br><br>  The reason is simple: the larger the company, the more factors hindering the transition to the cloud: it has many business units, outdated systems, mainframes, existing data centers, and third-party integration.  Some used applications may not work properly in the cloud.  Some data may be too secret to ever exist in a cloud environment.  As a result: a hybrid environment is a fact of life. <br><br>  <i>False # 4: You will save a lot of money in the long run with a cloud.</i> <br><br>  Can companies save money by going to the cloud?  Of course.  But cost savings are not the main reason why companies migrate to the cloud.  Companies can go there, because the cloud gives them greater flexibility, faster response response, as well as the ability to quickly move from capital to operating costs, thereby reducing the amount of costs required to start a project, and quickly enter the market.  Sometimes (I know, it sounds heretical!), The company's costs for the cloud will indeed increase.  In these cases, the company's goal is to weigh the costs and benefits that the cloud provides to see what is most valuable. <br><br>  <i>Lie # 5: We take care of everything!</i> <br><br>  Indeed?  In that case, will you deliver me coffee in the morning?  If you hear this line, immediately ask: ‚ÄúWhat do you mean by‚Äú everything ‚Äù?‚Äù When you have a clear explanation given to you in a documentary format, compare it with what you consider to be ‚Äúeverything‚Äù.  If they match, you can continue to cooperate.  If they are different, determine what should happen so that your ‚Äúeverything‚Äù interpretation is consistent with the cloud provider. <br><br>  If you blindly accept the statement ‚ÄúWe care about everything‚Äù, I can assure you that you have false expectations and that you will have bad experience working with a cloud service provider. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/330300/">https://habr.com/ru/post/330300/</a></p>
