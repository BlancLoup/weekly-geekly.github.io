They were offered five tasks, for each of which it was possible to get up to 100 points.  The winners were those who scored at least 485 points, there were 26 such people.  If you are interested in the conditions of the tasks or the results of the participants, you can familiarize yourself with them <a href="http://www.abbyy.ru/kafedra/olimpiada/">on the ABBYY website</a> . <br><br>  We invited all participants to visit us.  In total, we have visited 21 people and only 9 of them are students of Moscow universities.  Guys from Minsk, Izhevsk, Saratov, Simferopol, Sevastopol, Ivanovo, Orel came to us.  <a href="http://maps.yandex.ru/-/CBUqaP8m">The longest way to our office was</a> done by a participant from Tomsk (almost 3000 km one way).  But the real hero turned out to be a student of Kazan Federal University, who <a href="http://maps.google.ru/maps%3Fsaddr%3D%25D0%259C%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0,%2B%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%2B%25D0%259C%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0,%2B%25D0%259A%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9%2B%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%26daddr%3D%25D0%259C%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F%2B%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%258C,%2B%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%2B%25D0%2594%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D1%2583%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9,%2B%25D0%259F%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F%2B%25D1%2583%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D1%2586%25D0%25B0%26hl%3Dru%26ie%3DUTF8%26ll%3D55.852963,37.589722%26spn%3D0.175755,0.63652%26sll%3D55.85319,37.59565%26sspn%3D0.175753,0.63652%26geocode%3DFUALUwMd0J0-AimzIj2Xfkq1RjHKaxQCnLJgEA%253BFZBxVQMdzYU8AikdSwyTgDm1RjG-U7bi71fsww%26mra%3Dltm%26dirflg%3Dw%26z%3D11">walked</a> from the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthree railway stations (Komsomolskaya metro station) to Dolgoprudny (the winners lived in the MIPT hostel).

    <a name="habracut"></a>  When the guests gathered, we asked them to share their impressions of the Olympiad.  Since the Olympiad was held in the midst of the session, we heard many stories in the spirit of the guys: ‚ÄúI was preparing for the exam, but decided to digress a little, went to the Olympiad site and decided everything for a couple of hours.  There were other options: ‚ÄúI woke up on Sunday, unexpectedly early, came across the ABBYY Cup, quickly got everything in and left to sleep.‚Äù  Well, the most pleasant response was gratitude for the fact that we gave the person "to remember the programmer-olympiad youth."  In turn, we told the children <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/abbyy/blog/117041/">about our department at MIPT</a> , about the company itself, about how we relax together, and taught us to play <a href="http://www.mosigra.ru/Face/Show/boom/">‚ÄúBoom‚Äù</a> - this board game with us at ABBYY has been especially popular lately. <br><br>  The next day, our guests were awaited by an extensive introductory and educational program.  The first item of this program was a meeting with Valery E. Krivtsov, dean of the department of innovation and high technology at MIPT, on which our department is based.  He told the children a little about Physics and Technology, about the faculty and about our department.  This, in fact, the Physical and Technical Part of the day ended and the office part began. <br><br>  We brought the guys to the office in Otradny, where the vice-president of the company Aram Pakhchanyan (he's <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/aram_pakhchanian/" class="user_link">aram_pakhchanian</a> ) was already waiting for them.  He told them about the company's activities, high-tech developments, priority research directions, which are conducted in ABBYY.  The conversation took place in a rather informal atmosphere, which was indirectly confirmed by the ottomans in which the students settled down :) <br><br>  Then they waited for lunch, after which there was a small tour of the office. <br><br>  Large balcony on the top floor <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/546c611b/51555450/6c4b5d21/2d5ca273.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/aebc2916/bce59d5b/5cb0cc3f/a174a1f9.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/d4552f07/c5e5ebd2/63c12fe1/8d514f9d.jpg"><br><br>  "Sea" Hall <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/90cb38bd/cc51e5a7/60e54cde/eade7fe9.jpg"><br><br>  Hall "Provence" <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/ee88e540/c913ae4e/08a19fb1/1df29519.jpg"><br><br>  "Children's" hall (you can draw on the left wall) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/7139544e/65fc0924/5768b53a/d4e2654e.jpg"><br><br>  Compartments <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/a04de8ad/cd82c2d1/baad336b/dcca425d.jpg"><br><br>  Conference hall <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/489cafa0/18fe826e/95de5acc/1b076efa.jpg"><br><br>  The guys saw how our programmers and linguists work, what we do, so that our brains do not boil during the day, and how we communicate with each other.  After this, a meeting was held with our CEO, Sergey Andreev.  He told why it is good to work in ABBYY, and dedicated our guests to some of the subtleties of the development of our secret product not so long ago - ABBYY Compreno. <br><br>  For the winners of the ABBYY Cup, the results of the Olympiad were counted as entrance examinations for the selection to the department of "Image Recognition and Text Processing" at MIPT or for employment at ABBYY.  And a few guys are already successfully working in our company!  As for the prospects of ABBYY Cup, we can only say one thing: to be a competition :) If you are interested in ABBYY Cup, register <a href="http://www.abbyy.ru/kafedra/olimpiada/form/">here</a> - and we will send you an invitation to the next competition.  Good luck! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/33d66c53/102cae73/4431d540/417ce58e.jpg"><br><br>  <i>Dmitry Gritsan</i> <i><br></i>  <i>with the support of a group of educational projects</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/124199/">https://habr.com/ru/post/124199/</a></p>
