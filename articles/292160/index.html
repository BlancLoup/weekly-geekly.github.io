We went to a business breakfast with CallTouch</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On the 24th of November at Nevsky 8 ‚ÄúCallTouch‚Äù a business breakfast was held.  The speakers of Elama, CallTouch, ROIRS and Artillery Group offered coffee to the invited audience and talked about the eternal: ‚ÄúHow to make ROI higher, and the content more interesting?‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ece/16c/0df/ece16c0df6744bac973423797a7636b0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In order to stay in trend and do not stop in development, we try to attend events in the field of Internet marketing.  However, the time spent on free events also costs money.  Therefore, we would like to talk about how it was, where it was, what we heard and what conclusions we made so that you can form your opinion and decide whether to attend such events. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>About the place</b>

      In addition to the cozy cafe, the Artist's Shop is famous for selling various thematic literature and unusual items brought from exhibitions, galleries and museums in many countries of the world. <br>  In short, the atmosphere favored the perception of the beautiful. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cc5/58f/f15/cc558ff15d2b461ba0cf1f550eb63f49.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>About speeches</b> <br><br>  Arkady Yaparov, head of marketing at Elama, began his speech first.  Theme: ‚ÄúEffective contextual advertising.  Automation capabilities and practical advice. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/32a/824/e55/32a824e55b3b4c16baab9ddd07bb3c64.jpg"><br>  Arkady talked about the advantages of online advertising automation, examining examples of the influence of certain parameters on the clickability of ads.  It would seem that everyone knows the basics of promotion in the network, but to know and use different things.  The case of ‚ÄúElama‚Äù clearly showed how minor trifles, such as the absence of negative words, can slow down the conversion from the site. <br><br>  The main theses of the report: <br>  1. Specify the price of the goods in the advertisement. <br>  2. The title and ad text must contain keywords. <br>  3. Are there discounts and promotions?  Mention them in the ad text. <br>  4. Use negative keywords. <br>  5. Constantly adjust the campaign.  Remove non-target words with a low CTR. <br><br>  Alexey Avdeev, Sales Director of Calltouch, spoke with the topic: ‚ÄúMarketing optimization based on analytics of referral sources.  We monitor calls and requests, we increase the effectiveness of advertising by 2 times, ‚Äùwhich immediately attracted our attention.  The specifics of our business is very similar. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/da7/ef8/ad6/da7ef8ad6df64849b9a05b2b69108b3b.jpg"><br>  Alexey explained to the audience the advantages of the call source tracking system, using the substitution of numbers on the site.  As an example, mentioning the case of the company "Sparta". <br><br>  The main theses of the report: <br>  1.70% of orders are carried out by phone, but Yandex Metric does not track them. <br>  2. The system allows you to track the visitor's actions (when he called, on contact with which advertising campaign, how many times he made the call). <br>  3. The time of reserving a phone number for a client directly depends on the duration of the visit and the depth of viewing the site. <br>  4. The cost of the service depends on the time of reservation.  The minimum package of services from 4500 rubles.  500 site visitors will cost about 5,000 rubles. <br>  After the report, the speaker drowned in questions from the audience.  Hall could not understand how to control the advertising campaign and lead the client if the company number is constantly changing on the site.  A different experience with the calltracking system was voiced.  Alexey responded to a number of voiced problems, but still, the tool he proposed was not easy to understand. <br><br>  After a short break, Maksim Pichevsky, managing partner of ROI RS, spoke.  His performance ‚ÄúFrom clicks to ROI.  The real marketing automation case was the most memorable. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ddf/117/1b5/ddf1171b501f4aaa8313d27d8dad7fa5.jpg"><br>  The main message of the speech: it is difficult for marketing to work with voluminous statistics and reporting.  Therefore, a tool was created that, to the maximum, removes this burden from the creative professions, analyzing the costs of the organization using external resources. <br>  The presentations included questions to the audience and immediately provided answers to them, statistics, information about the marketing management system, as well as a case for working with a large client. <br><br>  The main theses of the report: <br>  1. The system integrates data from the PBX to process all applications. <br>  2. There is a detailed report on the operators, calls made and their sales, conversion of each employee.  ROI is calculated from each advertising campaign. <br>  4. Many marketers miscalculate ROI, because profits and investments are not the same.  To be sure, you need to divide profits into investments. <br>  5.The original data is integrated into the CRM report.  After the work done, recommendations are made on the work of the marketing department and budget allocation. <br>  After Maxim‚Äôs speech, there were only three questions: ‚ÄúAre there any other similar cases?‚Äù, ‚ÄúThis is more a system or consulting services‚Äù and ‚ÄúHow much does it cost?‚Äù. <br>  It turned out that there are cases.  This product is a system and consulting in one.  Its cost is 20 000 rubles per month. <br><br>  Alexander Kuzmin, managing partner of Artillery Group, spoke on the topic: ‚ÄúWeb analytics for b2b and b2c.  The nuances that will turn your picture of the world upside down (Internet marketing for sure). ‚Äù <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f0a/053/041/f0a053041faf4c53a6a3001c069f4477.jpg"><br>  The key point of the report was the end-to-end analytics, there was a lot of information about the work of the Google Analytics service.  In the first 5 minutes of the report, to be honest, there was a feeling that Alexander was working on Google :) <br><br>  The main theses of the report: <br>  1.Google Analytics is multichannel and multidepartmental analytics, customizable reports, connecting CRM and calltracking services through an API.  And the system is configured easier than it seems. <br>  2. Through analytics is an analysis of the effectiveness of advertising campaigns based on sales data. <br>  3.Google Analytics allows, depending on the advertising campaign, to give priority to different sources.  Thereby allowing to analyze in detail the expenditure budget for attracting each client. <br>  Speech by Alexander gave reason to think about the need to work with Google Analytics directly, and not through intermediaries. <br><br>  <b>About impressions</b> <br><br>  All expectations were met.  The nearest plans included: adding new indicators to marketing reports, working out keywords with a low CTR for an advertising campaign in Yandex Direct and adding a number of negative keywords, as well as developing a campaign in Google Analytics. <br><br>  <b>The main advantages of the past business breakfast:</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ A good venue for the event.  We were pleased with the friendly staff and cozy room design. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Speakers felt confident and correctly answered questions from the audience.  Theoretical knowledge was confirmed by cases. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Bonus, for the most hungry: endless coffee, juices and tea were backed up with cookies and fruit. <br>  <b>Among the shortcomings were only annoying, but minor trifles:</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ There was no microphone for the audience.  Some questions were not heard by the audience. <br>  ‚Ä¢ The seats of many chairs were loose. <br><br>  The general emotion of visiting a business breakfast was a pleasant boost in morale.  There were no disgruntled persons, but there were reflections.  So everything was not in vain. <br><br>  <b>Summing up.</b> <br><br>  If you are also looking for methods of analytics and business promotion, be sure to feel for all the options: <br>  1. <a href="http://elama.ru/">Elama</a> <br>  2. <a href="http://www.calltouch.ru/">CallTouch</a> <br>  3. <a href="https://roi.rs/">ROI RS</a> <br>  4. <a href="http://artilleria.ru/">Artilleria</a> <br>  5. <a href="http://cashmyvisit.com/%3Futm_source%3Dspark.ru%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3DCashMyVisit">Cashmyvisit</a> <a href="http://cashmyvisit.com/%3Futm_source%3Dspark.ru%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3DCashMyVisit"><br></a> <br><br>  Try and something will definitely work;) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292160/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292160/</a></p>
