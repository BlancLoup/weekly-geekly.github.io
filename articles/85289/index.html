Review</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A few months ago I published a small cycle of reviews of Russian-made devices ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/telecom/77693/">MLink</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/telecom/78589/">LANTASTIKA</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/telecom/81671/">qBRIDGE</a> ). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/44e/35c/fad/44e35cfadfdd062906c5bd174d3c24d2.jpg"><br><br>  In connection with the change of the place of my work, I will have to draw the final line now, despite the fact that the time has not yet come to end testing. <br>  The overall impression is difficult to express because of the fundamental difference of devices on the one hand and because of the specific nature of the problems on the other.

      Initially proved to be a good device.  He performed his functions, remote control via telnet (in Russian) was present (as well as the console).  Convenience was in the modular structure (the ability to install other boards) and the possibility of installation in a 19 "rack. <br>  In general, we were satisfied with everything in it (except, perhaps, the limitations of 2Mb, i.e. only 1 E1 stream).  But he hung up a few times.  It hung so tight that you had to go into place to reboot. <br><blockquote>  &lt;offtopic&gt; <br>  The following story is related to this problem: <br>  December 30th.  16:00 - the start time of the corporate party.  I am going to the office from vacation, and my colleagues are going home to leave cars and buy supplies.  Because of traffic jams, they are late for an hour.  While I wait for them, the Internet falls off.  30 minutes picking iron and butting with the provider and the Internet restored.  Then, after the colleagues return on the box from the radio-relay antenna, we will organize an improvised table and a Christmas tree from the LEDs.  It is time to sit down.  And here the sound of critical accidents breaks the pre-holiday atmosphere: 3 nodes are not available. <br>  So far, the point is - calling those who provide transportation, notification of the right persons - time is already 17:20.  It turns out that we have a problem.  The only guess is MLink at the other end of the city.  The building closes at 18:00, no one has cars anymore.  Five or six taxi companies are denied cars: "There are no free cars."  Two employees go to the place on the tram, warning the owners of the building about their late visit, I remain in the central hub to monitor.  After 10 minutes, the light is turned off throughout our building - an explosion at a nearby plant. <br>  Needless to say that the clock to 7 all the trouble ended with a reboot of this ill-fated device? <br>  &lt;/ offtopic&gt; <br></blockquote><br>  These annoying troubles (together with those already known from the review) spoil the overall good impression. <br><br><h5>  Summary </h5><br>  <b>What we liked:</b> it performs its function, remote control is possible, you can put it in a 19 "rack, fine tuning, detailed documentation. <br>  <b>What did not like:</b> soviet appearance (as if cut off with an ax), incompleteness of the command line interface, problems with ping and telnet (read the relevant article), <b>hang</b> , unreliable grounding and power cable, poorness of additional software. <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/telecom/77693/">More about MLink</a> <br><br><h4>  2. LANTASIKA </h4><br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/6d/75/88/2232559/0/6.jpg" alt="LANtastIKa"><br><br>  Our torment with this device is worthy of a separate article.  For more than five months, we are already the happy owners of this miracle in the amount of two pieces.  During this time we went to the setting six times.  It would be more if it were not for 30 degrees of frost and wind (one of them is installed on the roof of a 12-story building).  Useful work time ~ 5-7% of the total time.  In fact, the link fell 1-2 days after setup.  The first few times this was due to the fact that the signal was lost - adjustment was lost.  After an hour or two of turns (we caught the spot first with a glance, and then we spoke on the phone in which direction to move and followed the movement of the spot) and the settings everything started to work - the signal was full, the loss and fixed bytes were 0. Good.  But not for long. <br><br>  The situation was aggravated by the fact that on both sides the BOXES stood on metal structures and there was a height difference (a twelve-story building on one side and three meters above ground level on the other).  Because of this, snow fell on the lenses of the lower modem, which worsened the signal, and when it thawed it melted, turning into ice.  In LANTASTIK it is possible to configure auto-detect speed (10/100 Mb / s).  On the device itself, this is indicated by the color of the synchronization indicator.  In the test conditions, everything worked perfectly - the synchronization was successfully established at a speed of 100 Mb / s with a good signal level.  Accordingly, if the function works, it is a sin not to use it. <br><br>  But "in reality, everything turned out to be different."  Another fall, the next exit.  On the one hand, the signal level is in order, but there is no synchronization (the green indicator is flashing).  Neither local nor remote.  ‚ÄúThere is no synchronization, and the signal is good - it means that on the remote side, the modem most likely does not see the beam.  It is necessary to slightly correct "- such thoughts come to mind.  But no adjustments and turns have led to the appearance of synchronization.  We are going to the other side.  And there is a complete signal, but the sync indicator flashes red.  Two devices could not agree on speed. <br><br>  It should be noted that remote control is not supported, and local is not possible at the moment, because the port is in the wagon of another operator, but there are no keys.  We're going to set up the first modem at 10Mb / s (good, as long as it is no longer necessary) - everything rises and works.  Several days.  And falls again.  -25 ¬∞ C do not have to walk on roofs and snow fields.  After warming last week, it turned out that this time the wayward device chose 100 MB / s and was again out of sync. <br><br>  Further, after repair for two weeks, the breaks were only during heavy snowfalls.  One day, the link jerked 5 times. It was the longest working period.  But the new day brings new joys.  Work (just work, not to mention stable) was never achieved: the link often falls and periodically out of sync occurs.  At the same time, we have not yet seen the device in operation during fog and rain. <br><br>  After this, to assert that BOXES is a dead-end branch and is not suitable for operators is, of course, stupid.  But, having a sad experience behind us, we can hardly turn to this technology again.  It is impossible to use such an unstable link as the main channel.  It is also difficult to rely on it as a backup.  And considering the considerable cost of LANTASTIKI, one can also think about laying optics (at least in short intervals - we had ~ 500m). <br>  On the other hand, the issue of synchronization is most likely a software issue.  And if you install them on a rigid foundation, at one level approximately, then perhaps everything will work. <br><br><h5>  Summary </h5><br>  <b>What we liked:</b> horizontal or vertical mount, appearance (futuristic), support speed of 100 Mb / s, detailed documentation. <br>  <b>What did not like:</b> sensitivity to the movement of the base, the complexity of setting, incorrect auto-tuning speed, dependence on weather conditions. <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/telecom/78589/">Learn more about LANTASTIK</a> <br><br><h4>  3. qBRIDGE </h4><br> <a href=""><img src="http://img2.pict.com/a0/78/c3/2604812/0/qbridgebothsmall.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  This is a device that, in spite of all its simplicity, pleased me.  Since its testing and installation (about one and a half months) no problems have arisen.  The only inconvenience is the absence of both remote and local access, i.e.  There are no settings to change, you can also view the status only on the front panel indicators. <br><br><h5>  Summary </h5><br>  <b>What we liked:</b> two installation options (per shelf or 19 "rack), easy setup, the ability to combine multiple E1 streams into one channel. <br>  <b>What did not like: the</b> almost complete lack of control (with the exception of microswitches on the panel), the location of ports and power on the rear panel. <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/telecom/81671/">Read more about qBRIDGE</a> <br><br>  Everything. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/85289/">https://habr.com/ru/post/85289/</a></p>
