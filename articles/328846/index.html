Results of implementation of Cambium Elevate on networks of operators</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/16f/96c/edc/16f96cedc39b4ac0b6ffe8f22cb921f2.png"><br>  No matter how mobile operators propagandize 4G networks, and now the future 5G - the fixed wireless broadband market does not even think to decrease. <br>  As practice has shown, no matter how much G is in the cellular standard - it‚Äôs impossible to provide truly unlimited communication within the cellular technology, and even with new G-standards we still consider GB traffic, and the content is getting harder (thanks to 4K-cinema and abundance of heavy advertising). <br>  By the way, the content also affects the requests of customers of fixed radio networks.  If earlier they had enough speeds of 1-3 Mbit / s, now this is clearly not enough - we need tens and hundreds of megabits for everyone.  On the other hand, the road of extensive development (obtaining additional frequencies) is almost exhausted - the air is not rubber, and it is expensive.  Therefore, now, more than ever, there was a question about the efficiency of using the available frequency resource. <br>  Last year, Cambium offered the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãElevate - software for low-cost hardware that allows it (without changing subscribers) to work with Cambium base stations with all their advantages - frequency reuse and honest TDMA.  A few months passed, and here are the first practical results. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Today, we will look at two examples of networks that have achieved significant performance gains by replacing base stations with Cambium ePMP equipment and installing Elevate software on subscriber devices. <br>  Such a network upgrade scheme allows us not to change the numerous client devices that make up most of the cost of the sector. <br><br><h3>  Example 1: </h3><br>  Base station (BS) Rocket M5, Tx = 20 dBm, frequency 5,250 MHz, channel width 20 MHz, sector 90 degrees antenna with a gain of 17 dBi.  Subscriber stations (AU) Nanostation M5 in the amount of 27 pcs.  connected to the base at a distance of up to 2 km with a RSSI signal of at least -75 dBm.  AC output power is set to 18 dBm. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/044/dc7/389/044dc73897b74644b4ea8975c073f10d.png"><br>  Fig.  1 Scan air Rocket M5 <br><br>  The broadcast at the operating frequency of 5250 MHz is relatively clean.  Figure 2 shows a screen shot of the BS configuration and speaker settings. <br>  Signal levels of subscriber devices

Connection parameters of NS M5 Elevate clients <br><br>  <b>Result with 54 subscribers</b> <br>  As a result of the increase in the number of clients, the average traffic load of the ePMP1000 GPS Sync sector increased to 19 Mbps, and the maximum sector load was 44.59 Mbps. <br>  Figure 15 shows the delay between the ePMP1000 GPS Sync BS and the UBNT Elevate AC, as measured by the Ping utility at the maximum BS load. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/db8/5c1/bd8/db85c1bd825d4ccb88b16d668d9b7108.png"><br>  Fig.  15 The delay in the channel at the maximum load sector, 54 customers <br>  Test from one of the clients during peak hours of network load <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/adb/1ff/855/adb1ff85580a49fba759cac9a058c957.png"><br>  Fig.  16 Built-in client speed test Test MAC **** CE: 3B <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/53d/04c/4a1/53d04c4a16764d4d91f6793831444328.png"><br>  Fig.  17 OOKLA speedtest from test client <br><br>  <b>The effect after a twofold increase in the number of subscribers (from 27 to 54):</b> <br><ol><li>  The maximum capacity of the BS sector is still twice the same sector parameter on UBNT twice! </li><li>  Optimal tariff plans are still twice as high as with UBNT; </li><li>  Network latency remains within normal limits. </li></ol><br><br><h3>  Example 2 </h3><br>  It was - the base station (BS) Rocket M5 Titanium, the output power of 17 dBm, the frequency of 5300 MHz, the channel width of 20 MHz, the sector 90 degree antenna UBNT AM-M-V5G-Ti with a gain of 17 dBi. <br>  Subscriber stations - Nanobridge M5, Nanobeam M5, Powerbeam M5 (total 44 pcs.) - are located at distances from 2 to 7 km.  Tariffs: 2 Mbit / s (6% of customers), 4 Mbit / s (74%), 8 Mbit / s (20%). <br>  RSSI signals on all clients are good, below -70 dBm - units, high modulation, data rate are mostly 130/130, 130/117.

To provide him with a tariff of 8 Mbit / s is impossible. <br><br>  <b>Baseline data for modernization:</b> <br><ul><li>  The maximum daily load of the UBNT Rocket M5-Ti sector with 44 clients is 32.5 Mbps at 20 MHz; </li><li>  During peak hours, customers do not get speeds above 4 Mbps. </li></ul><br>  Re-use the budget option to upgrade ePMP1000 GPS sync.  In addition, we will add an additional 37 ‚Äúnative‚Äù subscriber modules to the sector (mix of ePMP ISM and Force180).  The total number of subscribers in the sector was 82: NanoBrige M5, NanoBeam M5, PowerBeam M5 with ePMP Elevate software in the amount of 45 pcs.  (range 2 ... 7 km) and AC ePMP ISM / Force 180 in the amount of 37 pcs.  (range 2 ... 4 km). <br>  Tariffs used: 2 Mbit / s (8% of customers), 4 Mbit / s (67%), 8 Mbit / s (25%).

Customers with a tariff of 8 Mbit / s began to receive their service at rush hour.  Service plans remained unchanged, but with twice the number of clients served; </li><li>  The network latency is reduced to more acceptable values: from avg / max 82/230 ms to avg / max 77/189 ms with twice the number of clients served and sector loading; </li><li>  Customers were able to view online video in HD quality. </li></ol><br><br><h3>  General conclusions: </h3><br><ul><li> The use of ePMP 1000 GPS sync allowed doubling the capacity of sectors by connections and almost doubling their bit capacity. </li><li>  The effect of replacing a base station is almost equivalent to obtaining a second set of frequencies, replacing antennas with narrowly directed ones, and installing new UBNT sectors. </li><li>  Using GPS synchronization will allow even more efficient use of frequencies, or receive less frequencies for the same subscriber and bit capacity. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/c9f/ea7/cbd/c9fea7cbdcb04d5098d88656c507f5b3.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/bf7/17c/e09/bf717ce09f824028b91d953b1bfc3c20.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/52b/d66/e1e/52bd66e1ebf54d67b595fc949c420fc3.png"><br>  Under radio interference conditions, it is recommended to use base stations of the 2000 series with an out-of-band interference filter and an adaptive receiving antenna. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e61/336/8e2/e613368e24834aa9b9f74678c7bb5063.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/8e3/e1c/438/8e3e1c4389b54b9db145eb8ac55cd7a2.jpg"><br>  PS Anyone who wants to test Cambium Elevate equipment on their network can be completely free of charge (that is, free) to get CompTek base stations ePMP 1000 GPS sync with 30 Elevate licenses for a period of 4-6 weeks. <br>  And those who already have a positive experience with Elevate can save a lot by purchasing ePMP base stations with donated (i.e. free) installed Elevate licenses: ePMP 1000 GPS sync with 10 licenses, ePMP 2000 with 20 licenses and ePMP 2000 with 30 licenses ( when purchasing an adaptive antenna). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/328846/">https://habr.com/ru/post/328846/</a></p>
