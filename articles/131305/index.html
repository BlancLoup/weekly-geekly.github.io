  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Almost perfect scheme of fraud using Webmoney</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I want to talk about the new scheme of fraud in the Russian Internet, which I almost got myself into. <br><br>  We thought with a friend to buy a site.  On a specialized forum we found a topic with an auction, liked the site, made a bid.  The author of the topic did not indicate any of his contacts, so it was assumed that further communication between the auction winner and the site seller would be carried out through personal messages of the forum.  It takes about 30 minutes and my site seller writes to my friend, specifying whether he really wants to buy a site for the amount mentioned in the topic.  Receives confirmation, after which he proposes to proceed with the actual transaction, without waiting for the result of the auction, because the money is needed urgently. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As they say in smart books - ‚Äúthe attentive reader probably already guessed‚Äù, what is the matter :) Yes, of course, the person who knocked on the ICQ has no relation to the site - he simply copied the seller's nickname, trying to pass for him and get money for the site .  Already here we guessed about the scheme of divorce, and when a search by ICQ number issued a forum topic about selling asechny numbers, where the lighted number was sold 3 days ago, then there was no doubt.  However, it was not desirable to let the fraudster go. <br><br>  Since the scammer intended to receive payment via webmoney, I decided to play along with him, find out the wallet number and make a purely symbolic payment, and then submit the application to arbitration in order to block his certificate.  The fraudster agreed, sent the wallet number.  When checking the certificate to which this wallet was attached, it turned out that its owner is quite an honest person - in any case, the registration in 2004 and a personal certificate with a high level of business activity (aka BL) were unequivocally spoken about this.  Why would a person with such a wmid throw someone, getting a passport lock for it?  Then there was a suspicion that the owner of the wallet was not in the business, but was being used by the fraudster in a more cunning scheme. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

      <br>
      Finding in the contact information wmid ICQ number, I turned to this person, describing in brief the situation.  As expected, he did not know about any sale of the site, and the ICQ number was unfamiliar to him.  I asked for help in bringing the fraudster to clean water and having received my consent, I began to act.  Interestingly, the scammer gave the number of the wallet that did not belong to him - which means that if we were led to his bait, he had to somehow withdraw money from him.  To clarify this mechanism, we decided to play along with the crook and beyond. <br><br>  After learning what amount would be suitable as a prepayment, a friend wrote to the fraudster that the transfer was made.  In fact, no money was transferred, but the owner of the wallet was warned about the money allegedly transferred to him.  What is interesting, the fraudster immediately confirmed the fact of receiving the money, after which he went offline. <br><br>  Then the second part begins - the owner of the wallet is writing from another ICQ that they would like to use his services.  After a brief discussion of the details, the fraudster writes that he accidentally transferred a larger amount than necessary (and many times greater), so he billed the wmid wallet owner for the amount that he allegedly overpaid.  According to the logic of the fraudster, the owner of the wallet in this case had to make concessions and pay the invoice, not even seeing what he paid at all for the wallet from which the money came originally. <br><br>  We blinked a bit at the scammer - when the wallet owner wrote that the money had not come, the scammer contacted us again and said that he had mixed up the payments, accepting money from his other client for the money that we transferred to him.  Having received the oath assurances that we sent the money exactly, and sent it to the purse indicated by him, he went offline again, and after a minute from another ICQ, he again asked the wallet owner to check whether the money had arrived. <br><br><h5>  Results </h5><br>  So what we managed to do.  The seller of the site received information that under his guise a fraudster is deceiving potential buyers of his site.  The purse owner has saved himself from potential problems with wmid arbitration, because all suspicions lead to him, which means he could well have been blocked by webmoney.  We, in turn, saved the money by catching a crook in time. <br><br>  Unfortunately, it is not possible to punish the fraudster in any way, since all the information about him is fake.  ICQ was bought on the forum, and wmid was registered 3 days ago without specifying personal information. <br><br><h5>  Deception scheme </h5><br>  So, once again the scheme of deception.  The fraudster is looking for offers to sell sites on the forums, sets up the purchased ICQ according to the data on site sellers.  Then with these icq he writes to those people who have expressed their interest in buying the site, offering not to pull the deal and sell for the amount they offered the same interest to their site.  Then a person with well-pumped wmid is searched, who in addition provides some services.  This person specifies the wallet number, which is then transferred to the site buyer.  After receiving a confirmation of the payment from the buyer, the fraudster writes to the wallet owner that he paid for the service, but he messed with numbers and asked to return the difference by paying the invoice.  Thus, the fraudster completely covers all his tracks and practically does not arouse suspicion on any of the participants in the transaction. <br><br><h5>  Morality </h5><br>  Dear friends, be careful when shopping online!  Very carefully check the people with whom you make deals.  Do not be lazy to check their contact information in search engines.  And of course, connect the logic. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/131305/">https://habr.com/ru/post/131305/</a></p>
