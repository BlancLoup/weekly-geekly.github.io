  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Free broadcast DotNext 2018 Moscow</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rw/ze/pr/rwzeprmrsolkozn4im5ajsnera0.png"><br></p><br><p>  Less than a week is left before the 2018 Moscow DotNext conference: it will be held in the congress park of the Radisson Royal Moscow Hotel on November 22-23. </p><br><p>  According to tradition, a <b>free online broadcast of the</b> first hall will be opened directly on YouTube (the link is hidden under the cut).  Between presentations, keynote speakers will be interviewed. </p><br><p>  Only the first day and the first hall will be broadcast. </p><br><p>  To get access to all the materials you need to either come live, or buy a ticket for the online broadcast.  For those who go live, I want to remind you a few extra chips. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  <a href="https://dotnext-moscow.ru/onlinefree/">Link to broadcast</a> </blockquote><br><h1 id="diskussionnye-zony">  Discussion areas </h1><br><p>  After each report, the speaker goes to a dedicated discussion area, where you can talk with him and ask your questions. </p><br><p>  Formally, this can be done in a break between reports.  Speakers are not required, but usually stay much longer - for example, for the duration of the next report.  Sometimes it makes sense to skip the report from the main program (if you bought a ticket, you still have records) and spend it on focused communication with an important expert. </p><br><p>  It is extremely important not to stand on the sidelines, but to participate in the discussion and ask your questions.  Popular speakers are often surrounded by a whole crowd of people who want to, so it makes sense to immediately ‚Äúcatch‚Äù the speaker, go into the discussion area with him, stand in the front row, and feel free to ask interesting questions. </p><br><p>  Communication is not limited to only the report that passes on DotNext.  If you have seen many speeches of a particular author, for example, at our other conferences or on YouTube, you can try to discuss these topics too. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zv/nj/5p/zvnj5ph-mnphazluuwrupu5mml0.jpeg"><br></p><br><h1 id="vystavochnaya-zona">  Exhibition area </h1><br><p>  Sponsors have come up with many interesting activities.  We will not spoil everything, but you can hint what to expect.  Almost everyone will be able to listen to their mini-reports in one way or another, or to talk with technical specialists on relevant topics: Alfa-Bank about modern banking development, Optimajet - about Business Process Management and so on.  All came up with some of their own chips.  For example, Alfa-Bank will have technical challenges with the main prize Lego Mindstorms.  Raiffeisenbank will have a quest created with VC.ru and a Sega battle.  In Dodo Pizza, a Telegram quest was written about a developer‚Äôs gembe adventure.  On the contrary, Futurice will have a full impromptu (if you participated in this last time, then remember that Futurice is not boring). </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4_/_u/gb/4__ugbkaykrev4qipgaj-nd79pe.jpeg"><br></p><br><h1 id="tri-bof-sessii">  Three BoF Sessions </h1><br><p>  Immediately after the end of the main program of the first day, three parallel BoF sessions await you. </p><br><p>  BoF is now a traditional format at our conferences.  Something like a round table or discussion group in which everyone can take part.  This format historically goes back to the first informal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_of_a_feather_(computing)">discussion groups of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)</a> . </p><br><p>  No division by speaker and participant: everyone is on a par.  This is important for at least two reasons: </p><br><ul><li>  The format of the report is very useful because of its focus on a specific topic and the lack of opportunity to be distracted.  Everyone is sitting and listening to the speaker.  The BoF session is suitable for full-fledged communication between all participants and allows you to cover a wide range of related topics. </li><li>  Among the participants are many cool specialists.  They do not have a report at this conference, but this in no way diminishes their coolness.  Often they are speakers at our other conferences or occupy leading positions in well-known companies. </li><li>  Not everyone has time to ask questions in the discussion area, even if they spent more than an hour with the speaker there. </li></ul><br><p>  Bofs start <strong>in parallel</strong> with the party.  Drinks and snacks can be enjoyed on the bauf.  Anyone who is not full can speak.  You can't talk with your mouth full :-) </p><br><p>  <a href="https://dotnext-moscow.ru/party/">Three topics are</a> currently planned: </p><br><ul><li>  ".NET Core" (in Russian) </li><li>  "Performance" (in English) </li><li>  "DDD" (in Russian) </li></ul><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1w/9h/a5/1w9ha5lf3eb1sbnk5kf2kq7bbn0.jpeg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/di/n_/sc/din_scynci_22soqaylirmfyajg.png"><br></p><br><h1 id="vecherinka-s-pivom-i-muzykoy">  Party with beer and music </h1><br><p>  In parallel with the BoFs, the party starts at the end of the first day.  Drinks, snacks, music - all at once.  You can chat in an informal setting and discuss everything. </p><br><p>  You can move from bof to party.  You can move from a party to a bof. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cc/4h/vt/cc4hvt7kuxp3rudlpvopckmp3a8.jpeg"><br></p><br><h1 id="vystuplenie-dilana-bitti-vagifa-abilova-vagifabilov-maksima-arshinova-marshinov">  Speech by Dylan Beatty, Vagif Abilov ( <a href="https://habr.com/users/vagifabilov/" class="user_link">VagifAbilov</a> ), Maxim Arshinov ( <a href="https://habr.com/users/marshinov/" class="user_link">marshinov</a> ) </h1><br><p>  Our speakers gathered again in a rock band and will play very good things right in the middle of the party.  Looks like it is becoming a tradition! </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/72/nu/f1/72nuf1tb90ydes_kfej_bhoc4t0.jpeg"><br><blockquote>  We remind you that the offline tickets for DotNext 2018 Moscow are over.  Want to see the reports and did not have time to buy a ticket?  Live webcast is still available <a href="https://dotnext-moscow.ru/buy/standard/">on the site</a> . </blockquote><br><h1 id="vstretimsya-na-dotnext">  See you on DotNext! </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6n/ql/in/6nqlins_e2hcjzf5q-ekwnggdeu.jpeg"></div>
