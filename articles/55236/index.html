  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Caravan, a universal telecom operator, becomes the leader of the Moscow telecommunications market in terms of connecting fixed-line services based on fiber optic links</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Since March 2009, the telecommunications company Karavan starts connecting communication services with the construction of fiber-optic lines within 35 business days as part of the special anti-crisis program ‚ÄúOptimum Time‚Äù.  Traditionally, the term of connection of such services in the capital market is 60 business days.  A significant reduction in the service connection time on the basis of the ‚ÄúKaravan‚Äù fiber optic link network is associated with the company's desire to reduce the time spent by its customers on the connection of communication services.  The target audience of the special offer "Caravan" is a company of small, medium and large businesses that need telephony services, Internet access, data transmission channels and physical hosting. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Stanislav Drugalev, General Director of Karavan: ‚ÄúIn a situation of economic crisis, the development of the IT infrastructure of companies inevitably becomes part of a short-term budget strategy, when the real need becomes not only the reduction of financial expenses, but also the optimization of time costs for the project.  Our special offer ‚ÄúCommunication services based on fiber optic links in 35 days‚Äù responds to these topical market requests with maximum flexibility and allows you to shorten the connection of communication services with the construction of ‚ÄúKaravan‚Äù fiber-optic lines to a minimum.  At the same time, the quality of services will remain consistently high.  The proposal, no doubt, will interest and companies that need the services of Colocation.  By placing their own corporate equipment on the high-tech Telehouse Caravan site, they are able to connect their equipment to communication services and corporate networks as soon as possible, which is especially important in a situation of economic instability, high inflation rates and an unpredictable growth of exchange rates. ‚Äù <br><br>  By connecting communication services on the basis of fiber optic links in the framework of the special offer ‚ÄúOptimum Time‚Äù, ‚ÄúKaravan‚Äù does not shift the costs of optimizing its services to the client.  The offer is distinguished by an individual approach to the needs of the customer and is developed taking into account the specifics of the corporate IT infrastructure.

      About the fiber-optic network of the company "Karavan": <br><br>  The company has its own basic fiber-optic data transmission network, fully covering the territory of Moscow.  When building the core network, a cellular structure was used, providing multiple redundancy of all critical routes and an increased level of fault tolerance.  The backbone network uses WDM optical sealing technology, which allows dozens of times to increase the capacity of highways on the existing cable infrastructure.  The Karavan data network was designed using two main technologies: Gigabit over Ethernet and SDH, while Cisco Systems and Nortel Networks equipment was used to build the network.  The use of various technologies allows to achieve an optimal result both in voice transmission and in building a VPN with ensuring quality of service.  The backbone network of Karavan has multiple redundant connections to the public telephone network and the Internet, organized in various geographically dispersed locations in Moscow, which allows Karavan to provide communication services with a guaranteed high level of quality. <br><br>  The operator has considerable experience in the implementation of complex projects related to the provision of communication services on the basis of its own fiber optic link as soon as possible.  The company has been implementing similar projects since 2003.  Since March 1, 2009, this optimized service has been part of the anti-crisis program ‚ÄúKaravan‚Äù ‚ÄúOptimal time‚Äù, aimed at optimizing the budget and time expenditures of customers. <br><br>  About Karavan: <br><br>  Telecommunication company "Karavan" was established in 1996 and is a universal telecommunications operator.  It provides data transfer services, leases of communication channels, telephone communication, Internet access, physical and virtual hosting, and registration of domain names.
