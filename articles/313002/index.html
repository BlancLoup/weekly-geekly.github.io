Violations and damage to data in large public and private organizations are described quite often, and they are, as they say, at the hearing of business leaders and security experts.  However, thousands of such events, unnoticed by the general public, occur daily at the level of small businesses and individual users.  This article provides one of the solutions to the problem. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b7c/55d/391/b7c55d391be5432dac07f35e7b7a20af.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Symantec: attacks on small businesses are increasing </h3><br>  It is no secret that the level of cybercrime is constantly increasing, and small and medium business (SMB) enterprises are increasingly becoming the target of hackers.  The latest data from the Symantec's 2016 Internet Security Threat Report show that the SMB sector is also becoming an attractive target for phishing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6af/34b/839/6af34b839ac54f2ba465aabd116e3963.png"><br>  <i>In 2015, phishing attacks against SMB enterprises took 43% of the time from attacks of all types.</i>  <i>This is 9% more than in 2014 and is very contrast compared to the 18% attacks on SMB, which were recorded in 2011.</i>

      A Symantec report shows that for the time being, approximately 1 out of 40 (2.5%) SMB enterprises are at risk of becoming a victim of ‚Äúcybercrime‚Äù.  At first glance, this seems insignificant compared to statistics for large enterprises, where the ratio is 1: 2, that is, every second enterprise in this segment is under attack. <br><br>  Another thing is important.  The report notes that hackers attack their victims without any particular analysis.  The wording is simple enough, and, at the same time, clarifies the meaning of the attacks. <br><br>  <i>It is not a question of who they are targeting.</i>  <i>It is a question of all of them targeting your money.</i>  <i>Phishing attacks are made on specific employees, mainly responsible for small business finance.</i> <br><br>  Malicious emails sent to such employees can ‚Äúhijack‚Äù financial information for the entire company and open access to corporate funds and personal information. <br><br>  Symantec notes that ransomware attacks have also become more frequent.  They are aimed not only at employees, but also at any devices that are in the network being cracked.  (The meaning of using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransomware">ransomware</a> is to block or disrupt the device. It will be available to the user again only after some payment to the attacker).  In 2015, Symantec recorded a lot of attacks on IoT, smartphones, and even smart watches and smart television. <br><br>  Symantec also shows a 55% increase in the number of targeted phishing attacks from 2014 to 2015, which are aimed at specific employees, regardless of the size of the company.  For reference, it should be noted that Symantec classifies small businesses as having up to 250 employees. <br><br><h3>  Be prepared to protect </h3><br>  What should small business owners do with the above information?  Simple advice - prepare to repel attacks.  It is clear that hackers will continue to increase phishing pressure on SMB businesses. <br><br>  Since such attacks are mainly aimed at certain employees, it would be reasonable to implement a proper training and information program within the company using phishing schemes. <br><br>  However, it is often difficult for an SMB sector company to organize such training, and employees often superficially relate to the knowledge they need to gain.  In addition, they should first of all deal with their direct responsibilities. <br><br>  It is also obvious that it is better to limit the number of employees' smartphones and IoT devices, however, for SMB, compliance with this policy is also associated with certain difficulties.  As a result, SMB enterprises prefer protection to be carried out automatically and with the highest possible quality.  One of the solutions to the problem is the use of specialized routers (routers). <br><br><h3>  Cisco RV320 and Cisco RV325 Routers </h3><br>  Cisco routers for small businesses (Cisco Small Business Routers, SBR) of RV320 and RV325 models with Web traffic filtering add a layer of reliable protection, preventing, among other things, access to potentially dangerous resources on the network. <br><br>  For small companies with limited budgets, where there are not enough resources to maintain full-time security experts, specialized routers for small businesses are well suited, such as the Cisco SBR. <br><br>  Cisco SBR is equipped with Web filtering tools that block access to hacker attacks.  There are almost an infinite number of websites that employees of small companies can visit without the knowledge of management.  At the same time, almost any connection can be a means of gaining access to internal systems and small business data. <br><br>  Using the recently introduced specialized Cisco routers, you can set the appropriate Web policy for your company within a few minutes - and be quite sure that it runs without additional expensive security measures and additional IT staff. <br><br>  Why SMB Enterprises Should Use Web Filtering?  The obvious answer is primarily because their employees are usually open online, and without filtering, they can access any site. <br><br>  In this regard, Cisco's RV320 and RV325 routers are among the best for SMB enterprises, allowing you to maintain good network health.  They keep users away from dangerous websites with their malicious applications and questionable content, while not reducing performance. <br><br>  Just a few settings in Web Filtering allow you to categorize sites, set appropriate levels of protection, indicate the reputation of certain sites, and schedule the security service (see the screenshot in the Software section). <br><br>  A Kaspersky Lab survey, the results of which were made public at the end of 2015, showed that SMB companies spend an average of $ 38,000 to ‚Äúrecover‚Äù after a single case of data breach ‚Äî and this amount does not include indirect costs and a deterioration in the company's reputation. .  The same survey also showed that the most attacks were associated with malware and phishing. <br><br>  Using a Web filter, small businesses can significantly reduce these types of attacks and damage from them.  It is important to note that Web filtering is different from antivirus software, and using one approach does not obviate the need for another. <br><br>  The Cisco RV320 and RV325 models stand out among the routers of the Cisco RVxxx family as the highest level and having the highest IPsec throughput.  The main difference between these models is that the RV320 has four LAN ports compared to the fourteen LAN ports on the RV325. <br><br><h3>  Cisco RV320 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Router </h3><br>  Cisco RV320 is defined as ‚ÄúPPTP / IPsec / SSL VPN router with Gigabit ports and USB WAN failover‚Äù.  Its main advantages include the presence of the Administrator GUI, automatic load balancing WAN, the presence of an easy-to-use firewall (firewall), as well as support for 3G / 4G USB modems. <br><br>  The RV320 is a desktop router that measures 8.1 x 1.7 x 5.2 inches (width, height, and depth, respectively).  The device has a metal case and an external power supply.  Does not create noise, because it uses passive cooling.  Control indicators are located on the front panel, RJ45 ports - on the back. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4f5/2e1/e37/4f52e1e376814dab99dd42b0ca07c53b.png"><br>  <i>Appearance of the front panel and comparative sizes of Cisco RV320</i> <br><br>  The device has two 10/100/1000 WAN ports and four 10/100/1000 LANs.  One of the WAN ports can be configured as either a WAN or DMZ. <br><br>  There are also two USB 2.0 ports, one on the front and the other on the back.  They are designed to connect 3G / 4G modems and / or download software from a flash disk.  Note that the router does not support USB storage devices and printers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e3d/a60/6cf/e3da606cfe434cdebfce70c3c924b57e.png"><br>  <i>The appearance of the back of the Cisco RV320</i> <br><br>  The body of the RV320 is slightly higher than that of other devices of the RVxxx family, which ensures good air circulation.  According to user reviews, during continuous operation, the RV320 is no more than ‚Äúslightly warm‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/00e/87d/4a8/00e87d4a80a04703954276b7da84000b.png"><br>  <i>View of the motherboard Cisco RV320</i> <br><br>  Under a fairly large radiator is a dual-core central processor Cavium CN5020, operating at a frequency of 300 MHz.  Onboard, the RV320 also has 256 MB of DDR2 RAM and 64 MB of flash memory. <br><br><h3>  Specifications of Cisco RV320 </h3><br>  <b>Router</b> <br>  - (4) 10/100/1000 LAN, (1) 10/100/1000 WAN, (1) 10/100/1000 DMZ / WAN <br>  - (2) USB 2.0 ports <br>  - 3G / 4G WWAN Support <br>  - 900 Mbps NAT throughput <br>  - Dual WAN failover and load balancing <br>  - Protocol based load balancing <br>  - RIPv1 / v2, RIPng <br>  - 802.1Q VLAN - Support for 7 VLAN IDs <br>  - IPv6 <br>  - QoS management tools <br><br>  <b>SPI Firewall</b> <br>  - DoS, ping of death, SYN flood, land attack, IP spoofing protection <br>  - 50 Schedule-based access rules <br>  - 30 Port Forwarding rules <br>  - 30 Port Triggering rules <br>  - Static URL or keyword blocking (content filtering) <br>  - DMZ port and DMZ host functionality <br><br>  <b>VPN</b> <br>  - IPsec - DES, 3DES, AES Encryption;  MD5, SHA1 Authentication <br>  - 50 IPsec Site to Site tunnels <br>  - 10 SSL tunnels <br>  - 10 PPTP tunnels <br>  - 100 Mbps IPsec throughput <br>  - 20 Mbps SSL throughput <br><br>  <b>Other</b> <br>  - SNMP <br>  - LLDP <br>  - 802.1X Authentication <br><br><h3>  Cisco RV325 </h3><br>  The Cisco RV325 is classified as a ‚ÄúDual Gigabit WAN VPN Router‚Äù.  This is the top model in the line of Cisco RV VPN Small Business Routers.  If you highlight its main features, then it is high speed, support for VPN and VLAN, as well as simple configuration of parameters typical of high-level routers. <br><br>  The device supports up to 50 IPSec tunnels, in site-to-site or client-to-site connections, with an IPSec bandwidth of about 100 Mbps.  PPTP and SSL VPN servers support up to 10 concurrent client-to-site tunnels. <br><br>  The package includes an Ethernet cable, external power supply, quick start guide and a CD with full documentation.  Also included are guides for mounting in a standard 19-inch rack. <br><br>  The overall dimensions of the device are 9.5 x 2 x 7 inches (width, height and depth, respectively. Typical hull coloring is ‚Äúgray metal‚Äù. <br><br>  On the back of the Cisco RV325 are only the power connector and switch.  Non-slip feet are typically installed on the underside of the case for placement on a table or shelf, along with holes for wall mounting. <br><br>  The front panel contains status indicators, 14 standard LAN ports, two WAN ports, and a reset button.  There is also one USB port on the front and another on the right side.  Both of them can be used for 3G Internet, or for service. <br><br><h3>  User Reviews </h3><br>  In general, <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/">www.networkworld.com</a> describes this router as a ‚Äúsolid product‚Äù with the most common features of a VPN router and the corresponding functionality.  It is also interesting to bring some user reviews on RV325 from <a href="http://www.newegg.com/">www.newegg.com</a> .  Most of them are categorically positive: <br><br>  - Has more features than you would expect from a router in this price range. <br><br>  - Great for small office or home use with a variety of devices - multiple desktops or laptops, other network devices, printers, TV, etc. <br><br>  - Sustainable, convenient and ideal for small businesses. <br><br>  - I am not a ‚Äúnetwork guy‚Äù, but this router is light enough for users with average IT knowledge. <br><br>  However, what you should pay attention to: <br><br>  - If you have an understanding of the principles of networking and router installation, then this is a good choice. <br><br>  - While this router is very easy to install, it is a professional-level device and requires some knowledge of network organization and how to use its features to your advantage. <br><br><h3>  Software </h3><br>  A detailed description of the Cisco RV320 and Cisco RV325 routers software is beyond the scope of this review.  We note only some of its characteristics. <br><br>  After logging in to the Web GUI, the user is taken to the Getting Started page with links to the Setup Wizard and other general pages.  The Setup Wizard allows you to configure the WAN ports and gives you access to the configuration of the firewall.  The software supports Cisco Easy VPN, which simplifies the configuration of remote VPN users. <br><br>  In order to get an overview of the GUI of these devices, we will take a screenshot of the screen.  In general, the Cisco RV320 / 325 routers GUI is well developed, detailed and, at the same time, quite understandable for those who have an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãworking with network devices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/929/eb9/e5b/929eb9e5b8ce4179bb4239f3bf96d088.png"><br>  <i>DHCP configuration</i> <br><br>  There is also <a href="https://www.cisco.com/assets/sol/sb/RV320_Emulators/RV320_Emulator-SB_v1-2-1-14/default.htm">a</a> Cisco RV320 Web Interface Emulator.  Below is a screenshot from the Web Filtering section. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3fd/946/634/3fd946634b2144149698192f5db4234d.png"><br>  <i>Setting the filtering level by content category</i> <br><br>  As a conclusion of this review, we will give another opinion of the user from the site <a href="http://www.newegg.com/">www.newegg.com</a> : <br><br>  - I have been working with Cisco equipment for a long time, and I must say that this is one of the best products.
