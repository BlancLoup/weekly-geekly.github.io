  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Switch notes</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I will start from afar, with the fact that I have been friends with computers for a very long time and Windows has been used since version 3.0, if memory serves me.  I always considered Windows to be an excellent operating system and was its ardent defender until last summer. <br>  Getting familiar with Apple began a year ago when I bought a 30 gigabyte iPod, which at least could not hold my entire music collection, but taught me how to use playlists on iTunes, and today I just don‚Äôt understand how to store and search for music in a different way. . <br>  In the beginning of summer, 2 photographers came to visit me, and they started to show me a new MacBook on <a href="http://www.apple.com/">www.apple.com</a> .  He, of course, was very pleased with me - both externally and internally.  A month later, as soon as the MacBook appeared in ReStore, I bought it. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Before that, I had an Acer TravellMate 3002, a great machine, a 12 "screen, light, fast, with a bunch of card readers and so on. The MacBook is much heavier, the screen is bigger, it‚Äôs best to wear in a backpack. BUT IT'S NOT IMPORTANT! <br>  I brought home a beautiful box, opened and turned it on.  As it turned out, Mac OS X is understandable at first glance (I have never seen it before), it is very visual and simple. <br>  My first surprise was when I decided to connect my Stream.  I inserted the usb-wire from the modem into the beech and entered the login and password.  AND EVERYTHING !!!  I went online!  Mom, remember how much I put the driver on my previous PC, how much I set up and ran with a tambourine to make it all work for the first time, I immediately had 3 minutes, of which 2 I was looking for a piece of paper with a login and password.  Exactly the same story happened when I connected the printer, I just inserted the wire and pressed Print, that's all. <br>  When buying in the car already has everything you need to work an office employee.  There is a monthly trial of Microsoft‚Äôs office (though it‚Äôs sooo slow for 512 RAMs, as it‚Äôs still going through Rosetta, adding another 512 solves all the problems with this).  I was immediately very pleased with Apple's office, their Keynote (to make presentations, much clearer and simpler than PowerPoint) and Pages (similar to Word, fewer functions, but I liked the choice of document styles. I need a letter for work - here you are, you need an invitation to wedding - here it is. Any image can be dragged wherever you want at once into the document, command + t in all programs causes font selection, size, etc.) <br>  In general, the menu in one place for all programs is very convenient, you always know what and where.  Very convenient to use Doc, all frequently used programs within one click. <br>  I absolutely do not understand people who say that for OS X there are few programs and they need somewhere to look for.  Is it easy for a PC to find a program?  Oh well.  Not only is their insane amount and you suffer with a choice, so they are all the shareware, then paid, then some more.  Now, if I need some kind of program, then I describe its properties in the community of Makolyubov in LJ and after 10 minutes I have a complete list of what suits me, advice on how to use it all and so on. <br>  After Winds it was difficult to get used to just two things: a comma and a dot in the Russian layout are not in the usual place at the bottom right, but in numbers 6 and 7;  the second is the lack of the Delete button, its functions are performed by fn + backspace.  But this is a matter of habit.) <br>  Computer freezes happen, but extremely rarely, several orders of magnitude less often than PCs. <br>  The photo storage scheme in iPhoto is very unusual, but what's the difference where they are stored, when all the controls are possible from iPhoto?  True memory, she eats oooo much, honestly. <br>  Now about Widgets from Dashboard.  Convenient, very convenient.  By pressing one key, you have a page where you have everything you need and often looks: a calculator, a dictionary, Wikipedia, a translator, the weather, a calendar, etc., etc.  Quick, easy and compact. <br>  At work, one problem arose, but the big one was corporate mail through Exchange.  Entourage can not cope, Makovsky exchange sees only letters.  I solved the issue by installing Parallels, now I have little Winds and a little outlook in there :) <br>  It's nice to hold a MacBook in my hands, after its touchpad I can't work with a mouse, why is it needed at all?  There are many little things in it, absolutely unnecessary, but the discovery of which pleases you all the time!  For example, magnets on top of the screen for the Apple Remote.  Built-in camera, which when you install a small program works as a security camera.  It is necessary to leave somewhere you press the button on the remote.  The car squeals as if you put it on the alarm, if someone compresses it, it will start yelling like a real alarm and take pictures of the person who has touched :) <br>  In the MacBook there is a motion sensor that disables hard when the machine drops from the table, for example.  Using this function, you can turn the beech by sound into a Jedi sword (very funny)). <br>  The power cord is not inserted into the machine, but is magnetised, so that if someone touches the wire, it simply comes unfastened and the machine remains intact. <br>  The car is warm enough, the sound, especially after the last update 10.4.9, is loud. <br>  You can talk a lot about each program, but I think I‚Äôll stop here.  The benefits are an incredible amount of times the drawbacks of getting used to another system, even for conservative users. </div>
