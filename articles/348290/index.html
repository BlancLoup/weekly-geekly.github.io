  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Timlides does not happen much</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  No, of course, there should be at least a little less bosses than employees.  But this is not what we are talking about, but that the <strong>search for a Timlide is long, expensive, and there are no guarantees</strong> .  In any case, an expert in the field of hiring employees, Alexander Ziza, <a href="http://teamleadconf.ru/2018/abstracts/3206">says</a> that competent specialists are in short supply. <br><br>  On the theme of the fact that there is no life in the position of the Timlid, that you can forget about working with your own hands and get ready for an avalanche of unexpected problems, we already chew <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/oleg-bunin/blog/346760/">here</a> .  It's not so scary, especially if you take over the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/oleg-bunin/blog/346808/">experience of colleagues</a> . <br><br>  And yet, managerial tasks are not limited to the need <strong>not to drown</strong> yourself and <strong>grow a shift for yourself</strong> (there were <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/oleg-bunin/blog/347060/">several reports</a> about this in HighLoad ++ too).

      At the end of this week, managers of different levels will discuss who is to blame and what to do, within the framework of <a href="http://teamleadconf.ru/">TeamLead Conf</a> .  For two days in two streams, everyone can be discussed, let's see what is in the <a href="http://teamleadconf.ru/2018/schedule.html">program</a> and if there is anything wrong with that. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/dp/as/xqdpasohgbrks-ifimogvlkigow.jpeg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Soooo, giants will begin </h2><br>  One of Badoo‚Äôs technical directors, <strong>Nikolai Krapivny,</strong> <a href="http://teamleadconf.ru/2018/abstracts/3178">will talk</a> about the challenges of <strong>scaling up</strong> from a startup to a hundred engineers.  In particular, we will talk about the processes and their change with the growth of the company, about the balance in the formation of departments, the scaling of teams deep into and in breadth, that is, excuse me, vertical and horizontal. <br><br>  Continuing the theme of the explosive growth in the number of employees, <strong>Georgiy Mogelashvili</strong> from Booking.com <a href="http://teamleadconf.ru/2018/abstracts/3168">will share the experience</a> that has accumulated while the company has gone from being involved in a closed caste, partially abandoning leads for some time in favor of autonomous teams, and returning to them under the new <strong>concept "Servant Leader"</strong> .  And he will tell you how IT-management in Booking.com as a whole is arranged. <br><br><h2>  Parallel stream enters the chorus of skills </h2><br>  <a href="http://teamleadconf.ru/2018/author/2308"><strong>Arthur Orlov</strong></a> from AvtoTransInfo, in the spirit of a master known to all, <a href="http://teamleadconf.ru/2018/abstracts/3212">recommends the</a> following <a href="http://teamleadconf.ru/2018/abstracts/3212">stratagems</a> : <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúGreat is an art - to lead people to a common goal, and even <strong>8 small receptions</strong> can be useful. <br><br>  They may seem simple at first glance, but they forget about them going by creating code .... " </blockquote><br>  <strong>Ivan Mikheyev</strong> of AGIMA does not have any illusions that during the report he will be able to reveal all the subtleties of the profession, but he <a href="http://teamleadconf.ru/2018/abstracts/3196">is going to present the</a> minimum knowledge necessary in his opinion. <br><br>  Not about own skills, but about the performance of the programmers under control will be a report by <strong>Alexander Kiselev</strong> and <strong>Sergey Semenov</strong> from GitLean.  They <a href="http://teamleadconf.ru/2018/abstracts/3155">believe</a> <br>  <strong>development</strong> is quite <strong>amenable to measurement</strong> , although it does not offer a universal metric. <br><br>  <strong>Andrew Minkin</strong> from Mad Devs, becoming a Tee Lead faced the fact that, here is a surprise, people <br>  lazy and decided <a href="http://teamleadconf.ru/2018/abstracts/3127">to fix it</a> .  First, <strong>he opened an internship</strong> , after passing which it was possible to turn from a complete zero into a junior, and second, he explored methods of positive and negative <strong>motivation</strong> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/524/c64/de4/524c64de44734248636fd1e254bbb3bd.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Distributed Team Management </h2><br>  There will be two reports about the topic of remote work that is relevant in our big country.  <a href="http://teamleadconf.ru/2018/abstracts/3201">Pyotr Mukhin</a> from Veeam Software and <a href="http://teamleadconf.ru/2018/abstracts/3205">Alexey Kataev</a> from Skyeng will each tell about their experience and examples of forming a remote team, building communications between the manager and the team and the participants among themselves and many other aspects.  It is possible that the opinions of our speakers will differ - you, in turn, will be able to learn different points of view and draw independent conclusions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/29d/e53/cbd/29de53cbd035241b0f98373d8c7a4b8c.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Planning and evaluation of tasks, retrospective </h2><br>  In this section, a report on the actual assessment of tasks from <strong>Dmitry Simonov</strong> .  It seems to estimate in mind, multiply by two and add two weeks, not his option - <a href="http://teamleadconf.ru/2018/abstracts/3169">in theses of</a> as many as 10 (ten !!) points, including the participation of testers, productologists, and God knows whom. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/945/b07/f49/945b07f49613de1c0ae315148c5d51ec.jpg"><br><br>  <a href="http://teamleadconf.ru/2018/author/2302"><strong>Peter Markov</strong></a> from CIAN, in turn, <a href="http://teamleadconf.ru/2018/abstracts/3202">will talk</a> about the technique of <strong>retrospectives in the style of Zen</strong> : how to prepare for a retrospective, how to draw the most important lessons, how not to drop the team spirit, and most importantly - how to benefit from the problems and prevent them from now on. <br><br>  The program will be <strong>closed by Evgeny Golev</strong> from Lamoda, where she managed to organize the process in such a way that the Timlids dragged the basic principles of feedback into their skills, ostensibly without blood and coercion.  <a href="http://teamleadconf.ru/2018/abstracts/3094">Her report is</a> for those who see the value and importance of <strong>positive and constructive feedback</strong> to the Timlid.  It describes how to create an environment in which this skill develops and consolidates, how much resistance you can encounter on the way and under what sauce it is best to give the main ideas of feedback to team leaders. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a35/e34/106/a35e34106e5f05582fa95851bb5dd161.jpg"><br><br><hr><br><h3>  See you soon! </h3><br>  If you missed the earlier stages of ticket distribution, but were interested in the program, check if there are more places on <a href="http://conf.ontico.ru/conference/join/tl2018.html%3Fpopup%3Dtl2018">the booking page</a> .  An order for individual or corporate broadcast is also available there. <br><br>  PS: Positive and constructive feedback is important not only to the management, but also to us.  Write in the comments all that you see fit. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/348290/">https://habr.com/ru/post/348290/</a></p>
