We have selected five little-known Altcoins, which at the beginning of 2018 look the most promising.  The selection criteria are simple - a multiple growth rate against the US dollar and a growing multi-billion dollar capitalization. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/acb/1c6/a4b/acb1c6a4b711bf8d7bb5fa8bcdb96a1f.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Ripple (XRP) </h3><br>  This is a whole cryptocurrency platform for payment systems, which is focused on foreign exchange transactions of non-refundable payments.  She started to work in 2012.  This platform supports tokens that represent so-called fiduciary money (Fiat), commodities, or any other elements that can be used to pay for goods or services, including miles or mobile phone minutes. <br><br>  Part of the platform's ecosystem is XRP, a network cryptocurrency that exists only within the framework of the Ripple system.  Initially, over 100 billion XRP was released without the possibility of additional emissions.  When registering on the network, you must purchase 20 XRP, which is explained by the creators, as protection against spam.

      The system cooperates with such companies as BBVA, Mizuho, ‚Äã‚ÄãUniCredit, UBS, Mitsubishi UFJ and Santander (mainly Spanish and Japanese banks).  Ripple investors are Accenture, Google Ventures, Seagate and Andreessen Horowitz. <br><br> <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/ru/%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0_%25D1%2586%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD/ripple/usd"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fb/7g/14/fb7g14ofundmhxagun9rkhah47g.png"></a> <br><br>  Since the beginning of 2017, Ripple has increased in price by 342 times.  Now cryptocurrency is in the top 5 coins by market capitalization (about $ 120 billion). <br><br><h3>  Iota </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a77/db9/215/a77db921538c0faff6308c0e07d97123.jpg"><br><br>  IOTA - cryptocurrency of the Internet of things.  It is much younger than Ripple, since it was created about two years ago.  Its basis is the distributed magazine Tangle, not the blockchain.  The log structure is a directed acyclic graph (DAG).  There are no fees for payments, and the network is completely autonomous and supports itself.  Transactions are supported by the users themselves, and there is no need to pay for it. <br><br>  There are no miners in the IOTA network, moreover, the participants of the system are not divided into users and validators.  The network bandwidth corresponds to the number of available nodes and their activity.  The task of any system node is to send and confirm transactions. <br><br> <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/iota"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kc/bh/ua/kcbhuaoak9iohoznitsky0m0lcw.png"><br></a> <br>  The creators of IOTA have cooperation agreements with Microsoft Azure and some other companies.  The promise of IOTA, according to the developers, is due to the great future of the ‚ÄúInternet of Things‚Äù itself. <br><br>  The course of the coin for the year has increased several times.  Now IOTA volatility is high and is in the range of $ 3-4 per coin.  But, most likely, the course will grow. <br><br><h3>  Factom </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/857/92c/f5f/85792cf5fac5c3a3fd4779d5584b4380.png"><br><br>  Factom, in itself, is a system for protecting millions of real-time entries in the blockchain with a single hash.  Companies and governments around the world can use Factom to streamline record management, capture business processes, and deal with security issues.  The basis of the network is blockchain. <br><br> <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/factom"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nf/ki/lh/nfkilh29xbjbvkmdyyo5ijgiq04.png"></a> <br><br>  The FCT token is gradually growing, and many investors are acquiring it.  The market capitalization of Factom is almost $ 668 million. Many cryptanalysts promise the project a great future, since they are interested in large companies, including Microsoft.  The latter plans to use the system infrastructure to store its databases. <br><br>  Well, since the popularity of the project increases, so does the rate of the token. <br><br><h3>  NEO </h3><br>  And this comes from China.  Cryptocurrency blockchain was launched in autumn 2016.  The organizational elements of the system are similar to other cryptocurrencies.  The dignity of the crypt is the absence of a single command and control center on the part of the state (at least for now). <br><br>  NEO has every chance of becoming one of the most sought-after cryptocurrencies, since the creators of the system plan to cooperate with the Chinese government.  It is known that officials from the Middle Kingdom consulted with the creator of NEO Da Ho Fei before the ICO ban.  He himself argues that there is a possibility that China will make this cryptocurrency and its blockchain main in the country.  However, for now this is only speculation. <br><br> <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/ru/%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0_%25D1%2586%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD/neo/usd"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ap/df/k9/apdfk9nri6eknur6sl6qc7lqovm.png"><br></a> <br>  Over the past few months, the NEO rate has grown more than five times, and capitalization exceeds $ 6 billion. As in previous cases, large technology companies are interested in NEO, which are investing in its infrastructure.  The growth rate of the coin is also influenced by the fact that the developers really agree on cooperation with the Chinese government. <br><br><h3>  Nem </h3><br>  The infrastructure of this cryptocurrency was launched on March 31, 2015.  Initially, it became popular in Japan, and then in other Asian countries. <br><br>  Its feature is the formation of the blockchain using the Proof-of-importance algorithm.  Miner's reward depends on three factors: the number of coins in the account, the number of transactions performed, the duration of the account.  It has an integrated encrypted messaging system. <br><br>  Transactions in this system take place almost instantly, and the waiting time is just a few seconds.  The system performance is about 4 thousand transactions per second.  The total issue of coins is 9 billion XEM and there will be no additional issue. <br><br> <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/ru/%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0_%25D1%2586%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD/nem/usd"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ts/je/17/tsje176rtqxza7shsuxrdiwgigs.png"></a> <br><br>  Like previous Altcoins, the NEM cryptocurrency has risen several times over the dollar against the dollar over the past few months.  Its capitalization is $ 14 billion. <br><br><h3>  Do not rush to sell bitcoins </h3><br>  However, a balanced cryptocurrency portfolio requires in addition to dark horses and reliable assets.  All familiar, time-tested and still promising Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dash must be on your wallets.  The current state of the course of these coins is best shown by graphs. <br><br>  <b>Bitcoin</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nu/h0/iu/nuh0iuenata2bptasdb3p5gtmgy.png"><br><br>  <b>Ethereum</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/vv/mh/xqvvmhnhhepruuzz33dlivcvopm.png"><br><br>  <b>DASH</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gu/oh/io/guohioiympp5qtqx20f2w3p8uds.png"><br><br>  In addition to the purchase, they can still be mined - and the higher the course, the more profitable the mining.  The rate of these cryptocurrencies is high enough to recoup the costs of electricity and equipment. <br><br> <a href="https://hashflare.io/%3Flang%3Drus%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3D293361"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/732/274/538/732274538fe84deaa2eb52b871365420.jpg"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/374155/">https://habr.com/ru/post/374155/</a></p>
