This is not a mansion of an industrialist or an office of a shipping company, this is a school.

And in our time, the building continues to perform its educational function - since 1992, a private secondary <a href="http://www.pls.international/">school named after M.V.</a>  <a href="http://www.pls.international/">Lomonosov</a> , also known as <a href="http://facebook.com/lomonosovschool">Private Lomonosov School</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qa/n6/oe/qan6oers6jtju3iz7ivrrtzsa0g.jpeg"><br><br>  This is an international school authorized by the International Baccalaureate Program for Primary and Secondary Education (International Baccalaureate - Primary Years Program, Middle Years Program), which teaches Russian and foreign language students. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8k/mp/vs/8kmpvs_gpwyc0w9mar3ivoa0ibu.jpeg"><br><br>  Training is conducted in Russian, with the active support of English by teachers-assistants and teachers of the native language for foreign schoolchildren. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4a/ks/yl/4aksyls8lgfdab1ld4rbzb-kji0.jpeg"><br><br>  The school is also accredited and licensed in the Russian education system and operates according to state standards of the new generation, actively using design technologies and modern equipment in training, including the <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/hercules-2018.html">Hercules</a> 3D printer purchased from <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/">Top 3D Shop</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dn/2g/am/dn2gamuh4gxo-0prnpunxrs1njw.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/hercules-2018.html">Hercules</a> </h3><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4b/s2/jy/4bs2jyh15ntlakpodeagv1rw6pu.jpeg"></div><br><h4>  Specifications </h4><br><ul><li>  Printing technology: FDM </li><li>  Layer thickness from: 20 microns </li><li>  Maximum temperature of the printing platform: 125 ¬∞ C </li><li>  Extruder maximum temperature: 260 ¬∞ C </li><li>  Heated table: yes, removable glass </li><li>  Working chamber: 200x200x210 mm </li><li>  Noise level: 48 dB </li><li>  Supported materials: ABS, PLA, Flex, Rubber, SBS, BF Bronze, Carbon, Nylon, HIPS, PETG </li><li>  Diameter of thread, mm: 1.75 </li><li>  The diameter of the nozzle, mm: 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.8, 1 </li><li>  Power Consumption: 500 W </li><li>  Productivity: 34-50 cm3 / h </li><li>  Dimensions, mm: 391x380x496 </li><li>  Weight, kg: 18.9 </li><li>  Body Material: Steel </li><li>  Software: Slic3r </li><li>  Country of manufacture: Russia </li><li>  File Formats: STL, OBJ </li><li>  Calibration: mechanical </li><li>  Interfaces: USB, SD </li><li>  Number of print heads: 1 </li><li>  Print speed: 100 mm / s </li><li>  Compatible operating systems: Windows, Linux, MacOS </li><li>  Price: <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/hercules-2018.html">104,000</a> rubles (approximate, current price, see the website) </li></ul><br><h3>  Why Hercules </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pv/ov/p-/pvovp-yv64oboazq-c2tfyoh3-k.jpeg"><br><br>  ‚ÄúThe equipment was recommended to us by Top 3D Shop specialists.  The site of the company was one of the first in the search, in a telephone conversation we managed to explain our tasks and select equipment.  The choice fell on the Imprinta Hercules 3D printer.  We consider the Russian ‚Äúcitizenship‚Äù of the printer a plus, and in the course of using it, we were several times convinced of the validity of this opinion. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cr/88/fx/cr88fxtip4ziwg24t1po-ysezhg.jpeg"><br><br>  For example, when we first tried to print, we often had questions, and we were able to promptly find a solution by phone and e-mail. <br><br>  Six months later, we had the first serious breakdown - the belt had worn out, but the staff of Top 3D Shop promptly sent out a new one, which we easily installed and continued to work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/t1/n-/fb/t1n-fbqdqcajmup6jxqkwgyh6sk.jpeg"><br><br>  At the first order, we asked Top 3D Shop employees to assemble a set of different types of filaments to try them in - along with <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/materiali/pla-plastik">PLA</a> and <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/materiali/abs-plastik">ABS,</a> we experienced <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/materiali/materiali-flex/">FLEX</a> , SBS <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/manufacturer-filamentarno.html">Filamentarno!</a>  and rubber-like rubber. <br><br><h3>  What did you like </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4h/_h/b4/4h_hb4xgxu1dkuow4gbvcziwm64.jpeg"><br><br>  This is our first experience using 3D printing and, thanks to this printer, we can safely say that 3D printing is inexpensive and easy.  The printer itself is safe, but we still made a protective box for it, since children from 6.5 years old are in school.  The printer has a good balance between open and closed elements - you can follow the printing process and understand the principles of its work. <br><br><h3>  What benefits did the 3D printer bring and for what tasks? </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mg/oy/sk/mgoysk7y67sxmhyy2n2fpzd2dhw.jpeg"><br><br>  With a 3D printer, we were able to greatly expand the capabilities of students in several areas at once.  For example: in the Middle Years, in the Design subject area, students need to find solutions to various problems. <br><br>  We consider the following experience to be the most successful example.  Most of the teachers use magnets in their work: they attach examples of work, tasks and visual aids to the board. <br><br>  Taking this situation as a basis, we offered the children the task of design: to invent prototype thematic magnets for teachers.  Such work organically combines several concepts at once: communication is work with clients, magnets ‚Äúspeak‚Äù for teachers, they are personalized;  shape - surface area and size of magnets;  Prospects for using prototypes. <br><br>  The students had to create these prototypes within two months of interacting with the ‚Äúcustomer‚Äù, accepting edits and making adjustments to the project, from sketches to the final products. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fd/_2/tr/fd_2tr88cooidsumbjsi2bpgb1c.jpeg"><br><br>  The students interviewed teachers, sketched, printed prototypes, gave them to use, received feedback and, after drawing conclusions, made changes to their models.  It was important for us to show students that 3D printing is one of the fastest ways to make a prototype and evaluate it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_-/09/6l/_-096lryqaiyprikvz2vdkbmeke.jpeg"><br><br>  In order to increase the participation of all students, the work with the printer was carried out as follows: the students themselves launched their own models for printing, and a webcam was installed on the printer, the online broadcast allowed the students of the whole school to observe the process. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/va/gj/qq/vagjqqi9rbnvjd9uglwvzabjwba.jpeg"><br><br>  From this example, it is clear that earlier, before the appearance of the printer, we would have had to limit ourselves to drawings or use a limited number of forms and materials. <br><br>  Having once completed a full cycle of working with a printer, students memorize the main advantages and disadvantages of printing further, in other subjects and other projects, use it: for example, printing small dinosaur skeletons for a geochronological scale diorama (Geography), or printing a refrigerator layout for demonstration of the Peltier element (physics). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/99/l6/np/99l6npud7l9hrkkgarjdu0hjmn0.jpeg"><br><br>  The presence of such a serious technology always gives several directions in research to children.  They can calculate the economic component of their prototypes.  They can analyze power consumption.  In the case of older students, the hand-printed exoskeleton printed on a 3D printer was a good starting point for exploring the Digital Health section in the graduation program Information Technologies in a Global Society. <br><br><h3>  Difficulties </h3><br>  From what we had to face: at school almost all computer equipment on MacOS and iOS.  Thus, we had to specifically purchase a Windows computer for the slicer.  Now this problem is fixed - how to set up Cura Imprinta experts told on the channel on YouTube, we just have to try.  Now the printer can work with MacOS. <br><br><h3>  Nuances </h3><br>  The size of the printed area: choosing equipment, we certainly focused on ensuring as large an area of ‚Äã‚Äãprinting as possible.  A year later we came to the conclusion that the area of ‚Äã‚Äã180x180x180 mm is quite enough to solve most problems.  Including printing several prototypes at once, which seriously saves time and gives additional tasks for students (for example, the layout of chess pieces). <br><br>  Adhesion: the simpler the material in print, the better.  In hard work, you have to save time, which is best obtained by printing PLA: <br><br><ul><li>  The adhesion agent applied to the platform lasts for a long time, up to two weeks. </li><li>  After 2-3 cycles of printing, it becomes easy to remove the model without waiting for the table to cool completely - even at 40 degrees you can delete the model and launch the next one. </li><li>  The table quickly comes to a working temperature of 65 degrees, for other materials it is higher. </li><li>  PLA is non-toxic, unlike many other plastics - students can look very closely at the printing process, literally at the same time and even without a protective box, without fear of inhaling fumes. ‚Äù </li></ul><br><h3>  findings </h3><br>  As practice shows, the presence of a 3D printer in an educational institution allows students to become more familiar not only with modern prototyping technologies, but also with other components of the production cycle. <br><br>  Such knowledge will be useful in further education, regardless of the chosen profession, as it covers a wide range of industries and positions, from managers and production engineers to designers and support staff. <br><br>  Experts of <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/">Top 3D Shop</a> will help you to choose a 3D printer for an educational institution, please contact us! <br><br>  Want more interesting news from the world of 3D technology? <br><br>  <b>Subscribe to us in the social.</b>  <b>networks:</b> <br><br> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/top3dshop/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b25/fce/eff/b25fceeffa904b06ba0818fdef351e77.png"></a> <a href="https://vk.com/top3dshop"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c76/ee9/037/c76ee903753346c29abaa49280dfd828.png"></a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/top3dshop/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f91/396/101/f91396101d2b4579bb273636bc6283fd.png"></a> <br> <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/925/e7a/3b7/925e7a3b7e02499e833866f3b09f7674.png"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/432086/">https://habr.com/ru/post/432086/</a></p>
