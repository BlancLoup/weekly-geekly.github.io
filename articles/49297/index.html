To deny this is to say that the other person has more rights to your life than you yourself.  Your life does not belong to any person or group of people, but the life of others does not belong to you. <br><br>  You exist in time: future, present and past.  This is expressed in your life, freedom and the results of your life and freedom.  Losing a life means losing the future.  Losing freedom means losing the present.  And to lose the result of your life and freedom is to lose a part of your past that produced it.

      The result of your life and freedom is your property.  Property is the fruit of your work, time, energy, and talent.  This is part of the energy that you have wrapped for good.  And this is the property of others, given to you in a voluntary exchange and mutual benefit.  Two people voluntarily exchanging property benefit from it, or they simply would not do it.  Only they can decide whether this is true. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  From time to time, some people use force or deception to take something from others without their consent.  The use of force to take away life - is murder, to take away freedom - is slavery, to take away property - there is theft.  And it remains true, regardless of whether such actions are taken by one person acting in their own interests, or by a mob dissatisfied with several people, or an ‚Äúimpartial‚Äù official. <br><br>  You have the right to protect your life, freedom and property from the aggressive aspirations of others.  And you can persuade someone to help you defend yourself.  But you do not have the right to use force against the life, freedom or property of others.  Also, you have no right to use force against others for your benefit. <br><br>  People have the right to choose their leaders, but they cannot appoint rulers for others.  Regardless of how officials are chosen, they are just people and they have no such rights or desires that would be higher than the rights or desires of other people.  Regardless of the level of their actions, such as punishment, military service, taxes, officials do not have the right to kill, enslave, steal.  You can‚Äôt give them rights you don‚Äôt have. <br><br>  Since your life belongs to you, you are responsible for it.  You do not rent your life from someone who demands your obedience.  You are also not the slave of someone who orders you to sacrifice yourself.  You choose your own goals.  And success and failure are necessary conditions for learning and growth.  Your actions in the name of others, or their actions in the name of you, are virtuous only when they occur with voluntary and mutual consent.  Virtue can exist only when there is free choice. <br><br>  This is the basis of a truly free society.  This is not just the most practical and humane, but also the most ethical basis. <br><br>  The world problems arising from the use of force by governments have a solution.  This decision is for people around the world to stop asking officials to use force on their behalf.  Evil is generated not only by evil people, but also by good people who put up with the use of force, if it meets their own goals.  In this way, good people gave power to evil people throughout the history of mankind. <br><br>  To be confident in a free society is to focus on the process of researching the value market, and not on some deceptive vision or goal.  Using the power of government to impose this vision on others is an intellectual laziness that usually leads to unintended perverse consequences.  Building a free society requires courage to think, speak and act - especially when you can do nothing at all. ‚Äù <br><br>  (c) The Adventures of Jonathan Gullible.
