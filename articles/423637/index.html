Players can fight against AI, but if possible we tried to motivate them to play against each other, sitting next to each other at different monitors. <br><br>  In general, before conducting this experiment, the main scheme and the presentation of information in our game were not absolutely terrible.  Experienced players and users familiar with the genre usually understood the game without any problems without our intervention.  But at such live events there are people who have never seen such games before, and these players help us a lot by showing those hidden oddities and assumptions that we made to the game design. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, without further ado, let's move on to our observations: 
      <br>

    <h1>  Problem 1: people do not read the text </h1><br>  I think most developers know this problem.  Surprisingly, a large proportion of players skip any text that you show them.  We found out that the overwhelming majority (&gt; 80%) of the players simply clicked on the instructions we added to the beginning of the demo, which described the basics of the gameplay: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a5/e8a/d62/3a5e8ad62446297a8fbf107ee3404477.gif"></div><br>  <i>Menu with instructions.</i>  <i>Only 20% of the players bother to read it (and 100% of them win the battle)</i> <br><br>  We also sin with this - to be honest, who reads the instructions when buying a new gadget?  We expect it to be user-friendly, and you can more or less learn how to use it with intuition and experimentation. <br><br>  We were waiting for this, the more serious problem was that <strong>even during the game many players missed on-screen prompts</strong> .  This most strongly influenced the user experience when they did not notice the instructions telling what to do next: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/873/a86/a9c/873a86a9ce2caaf40650f50c8286794f.gif"></div><br><h2>  Decision </h2><br>  We know that usually screen text is the last thing players tend to turn to when stuck.  Therefore, let's make it impossible to miss: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b91/6f0/6b2/b916f06b231be1bf854a5e7826e1a6ed.gif"></div><br>  We <strong>use motion to draw attention to the prompt</strong> when it appears, and then <strong>continue to animate it until the player follows the instructions</strong> . <br><br>  Previously, the text was difficult to notice.  By making the player pay attention to him, we practically got rid of the situations when the players asked: ‚Äúwhat should I do next?‚Äù. <br><br>  We could probably improve the system by animating the text and arranging it so that it draws attention to the tiles that you need to click on to select a position. <br><br><hr><br><h1>  Problem 2: Interactive objects should be visible </h1><br>  Omit the obvious: the buttons should look like buttons, and the player should be clear what options are available to him at any time. <br><br>  In Steamhounds, the player in his turn must choose an action from the menu (some ability, for example, ‚Äúattack from a distance‚Äù or ‚Äúdefensive counter‚Äù).  When this happens, a menu appears: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/55f/8b3/ba7/55f8b3ba7f1ded2d131490a083b27bf6.gif"></div><br>  This works great - a clear audio prompt and attention-grabbing animation of the rotation are reproduced as the menu expands to most of the screen.  No one had problems understanding how to click on one of these buttons.  The problem is that after selecting the action, the menu disappears, and the player must choose a place on the battlefield at which his ability should be aimed. <br><br>  We noticed that <strong>at this stage, some players get stuck searching the screen with the mouse for items to interact with</strong> : <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f77/8cc/e75/f778cce755c6fe8f6962960956194092.gif"></div><br>  <i>The player is looking for what you can click on the screen, and his irritation increases with every second</i> <br><br><h2>  Decision </h2><br>  Although we highlight the tiles that you can click on, they stand out rather weakly.  Worsening the situation and the fact that players before choosing actions often take a brief look at the enemy, not noticing that there is a selection of tiles.  Here is how we solved this problem: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6b4/f99/8a9/6b4f998a9d1305289633ccd40939f51a.gif"></div><br>  <i>Flickering tiles draw player attention</i> <br><br>  <strong>If the player for some time does not hover over a suitable tile, we turn on the flicker.</strong> <br><br>  This simple change had the desired effect - at the next playtests session we rarely had to inform the player that he needed to click on the tile to continue.  We again applied the well-known principle - <strong>to attract attention, you can use the movement / animation</strong> .  When the flicker attracts their attention, they inevitably hover the mouse over one of the tiles, and the subsequent selection makes its purpose evident. <br><br><hr><br><h1>  Problem 3: calls to action must be instant / contextual </h1><br>  Indie developers often talk about the idea of ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äúcalling to action‚Äù when marketing games - it‚Äôs necessary that users ‚Äúsubscribe to the newsletter‚Äù, ‚Äúadd the game to the wishlist!‚Äù Or ‚Äúwrite reviews on Steam!‚Äù.  But also in the game there are times when the player must make a choice or perform a certain action.  So why not apply some of these principles to make the next press or player's decision as clear as possible? <br><br>  Before the start of the battle in the Steamhounds players need to set the starting positions and racks ("formation") for their squad.  The process of setting the formation does not immediately become apparent to all players. <br><br>  Here's how the screen looked before: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/341/940/00e/34194000e073c8452bd561fe4c1c70e6.png"></div><br>  <i>Boring and verbose instructions for setting the squad formation</i> <br><br>  Although she tells the player everything they need to know to set the formation, a couple of problems arise - <strong>(a) players do not read the text</strong> and <strong>(b) the instructions are presented as a single block of text that is not at all like a clear call to action</strong> .  That's bad. <br><br><h2>  Decision </h2><br>  Since we have already implemented a beautiful, eye-catching text, why not use it to break this boring block of instructions? <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2df/e09/e5b/2dfe09e5bdc6e55105fd68a36b9c6339.gif"></div><br>  Now we direct the player step by step - first, he needs to ‚Äúclick on the character to set his rack‚Äù, then ‚Äúchoose the rack‚Äù, ‚Äúchoose the position‚Äù, etc. <br><br>  <strong>Use contextual clues that tell players what to do <em>right now</em></strong> .  Thus, they gradually go through the whole process and are not deterred by long sheets of instructions. <br><br><hr><br><h1>  Problem: short and technical terminology should be used in moderation </h1><br>  We studied game design and mastered a very specific language used to describe the rules of the game.  We know descriptions with keywords that can be found on Magic cards: the Gathering or in the rule book of the board game - <em>‚Äúattacks one creature‚Äù</em> , <em>‚Äúdiscard 3 cards‚Äù</em> , <em>‚Äúcauses damage to all neighboring characters‚Äù</em> .  If you are accustomed to such a language, then these instructions are absolutely clear and unambiguous for you.  But I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve played games with more casual players, who sometimes interpret the rules in a way that your designer brain considers completely unintended. <br><br>  In Steamhounds the main part of the text with long descriptions of the rules is in the tooltips that appear when choosing one of the abilities of the character.  Initially, we wanted to make these descriptions as brief and strict as possible - after all, we do not need these pop-up tips to contain huge multi-line text.  Therefore, we tried to reduce them to one, maximum two, brief sentences: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fea/3da/79b/fea3da79b3764f83e3d19820e5ecf6c2.png"></div><br>  <i>Pleasantly brief, but problematic description of the ability of ‚ÄúFocus‚Äù: ‚ÄúGives Focus‚Äù</i> <br><br>  Everything seems right, right?  But we noticed that <strong>players use this ability too rarely</strong> . <br><br><h2>  Decision </h2><br>  We thought that the main reason for the unpopularity of the Focus ability is as follows: <strong>players who have not read the rules carefully shown to them earlier simply do not have the context necessary to understand the importance or advantages of the ability</strong> .  Many players skip acquaintance with the rules, and hovering the cursor on this button, they first encounter the mention of the ‚ÄúFocus‚Äù mechanics.  Therefore, we made the following change: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b94/4b4/adf/b944b4adf6bf01771aa8e69d51cff450.png"></div><br>  <i>A slightly more detailed description: ‚ÄúGives focus.</i>  <i>Unlock your most powerful abilities. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  Yes, the description has become a bit more verbose.  But we noticed that the proportion of people using this ability has increased.  The new text simultaneously ‚Äúsells‚Äù the ability to the player, and provides additional context so that they can understand its importance from the tooltip itself, even if they did not read the rules. <br><br>  We learned a general principle from this problem: <strong>to describe things in a cool or attractive way, and to strive to make the main mechanic effects obvious to all players, not just to those who have already learned the information from somewhere else</strong> . <br><br><hr><br><h1>  Problem 5: people are biased about certain words </h1><br>  We made some interesting observations about how the language we use causes some players to interpret the rules in unexpected ways.  We felt that this was the result of deep-rooted associations with these words that they have. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a5b/7b9/b8f/a5b7b9b8f39f8a03626a729a973b0743.png"></div><br>  <i>The old description of ‚ÄúVigor Potion‚Äù: ‚ÄúChoose a target.</i>  <i>Her next attack will deal double damage. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  What is the problem here?  <strong>The word <em>"goal"</em> has an aggressive connotation</strong> . <br><br>  The word "goal" is often used in the text of the rules as a neutral term for everything that the ability is aimed at.  Experienced players may already get used to this, and understand that the ability described above is obviously an enhancement that you need to use on your own characters.  But the association between the word "target" and the attack was so strong that some players believed that this ability should be used on the enemy so that the next attack <em>would</em> cause additional damage. <br><br><h2>  Decision </h2><br>  It seemed that we would have to deviate from the use of such a technical language.  Here is how we solved the problem: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/678/a73/a53/678a73a53870131ed943cf54a11cc26a.png"></div><br>  Improved description: ‚ÄúStrengthens an ally.  His next attack will deal double damage. ‚Äù <br><br>  For the designer, this approach is quite painful - this description seems unnecessarily verbose.  However, we noticed that the new text essentially eliminated the misunderstanding about the effect of this ability, and the players stopped trying to send it to their enemies.  Developers should take into account the shades of meaning and target audience, and find a balance in what suits them.  Too long texts of the rules are definitely a problem, but easy redundancy makes it possible to emphasize the style and character of the game. <br><br>  Useful lesson: <strong>watch the playters to see if the choice of terminology leads to unexpected consequences</strong> .  Even among English-speaking users, this can be highly dependent on culture. <br><br><hr><br><h1>  Problem 6: people have associations with certain colors </h1><br>  This problem is similar to the previous topic about the connotation of words.  Colors are also associated with certain feelings or concepts.  We have already used this in the game, creating a highlight tiles to demonstrate the effects of abilities.  Red - aggression, green - support / protection, etc. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f60/2a8/4e1/f602a84e1b802b6d235d2878a158e5c8.gif"></div><br>  <i>Scary Red Tile Lights</i> <br><br>  In most cases it worked fine.  But there was one association that we could not foresee, and it confused a couple of players.  <strong>They associated red color not with <em>aggression</em> , but with the <em>wrong</em> action</strong> .  Therefore, when they hover over the target to attack it, they were confused - they thought that the game tells them that it is impossible to aim at this character (in fact, the game simply does not show the tile if it is not the right goal). <br><br><h2>  Decision </h2><br>  We tried to avoid ‚Äúintersections‚Äù of conflicting associations.  Our solution: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/611/cc8/e24/611cc8e2411ad45181f6fdb8850f82bd.gif"></div><br>  <i>Almost the same (but not quite) red-orange tile highlighting</i> <br><br>  We just shifted the red light closer to a slightly orange shade.  It remained to be seen if this really solved the problem (which in fact only affected a couple of players).  But the funny thing is that no one else is wrong in this way. <br><br>  Therefore, I repeat, <strong>make sure twice that your interpretation does not negatively affect associations existing in the minds of the players</strong> . <br><br><hr><br><h1>  Problem 7: extra clicks are evil </h1><br>  We were already aware of this, so we developed and configured the UI to eliminate unnecessary clicks.  The problem arose after the last-minute addition to the build of a game specifically designed for demonstration at events. <br><br>  At the end of the battle, the fanfare plays and a large message ‚ÄúVictory‚Äù or ‚ÄúDefeat‚Äù appears on the screen: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/052/bf5/5a2/052bf55a24f28da4854a5e64a5dd1795.png"></div><br>  The player can then click on any place on the screen to exit the battle and return to the main menu.  We changed the demo assembly so that after the player exits the battle, the mailing list subscription dialog is displayed. <br><br>  It seemed like a great idea, but she had one fatal flaw.  The moment the message ‚Äúvictory‚Äù or ‚Äúdefeat‚Äù appears on the screen is exactly the moment when players shake hands (or begin to quarrel) and get up from their seats.  The battle is over, and there is no point in sitting at the computer anymore.  Therefore, <strong>they left without even seeing the mailing dialog box</strong> . <br><br><h2>  Decision </h2><br>  <strong>The game should automatically in a couple of seconds display the subscription screen.</strong> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0a1/79c/361/0a179c361e72e5e3353b3f8602488d6b.gif"></div><br>  To be honest, we should have foreseen this in advance, but the function was added at the last moment.  However, a simple change ‚Äî the removal of an optional click ‚Äî increased the number of subscriptions to our newsletter <strong>threefold</strong> compared with the previous result.  <strong>To hell with these optional clicks!</strong> <br><br><hr><br><h1>  findings </h1><br><ul><li>  Use motion / animations to draw attention to text prompts. </li><li>  Make interactive UI elements obvious </li><li>  Think of clues as calls to action.  Make them instant and contextual. </li><li>  Do not bother with technical language and strive to convey context to help players understand their decisions. </li><li>  Check unexpected mental associations with colors, words, etc. </li><li>  Smooth UI movement, eliminating unnecessary clicks. </li></ul><br>  I hope the principles described in this article will be useful in your own game.  But most of all, we hope that we can convince you of the value of the standard approach: <strong>watch for new players, find moments when they get stuck or confused, and then derive the basic principles and apply them to the whole game.</strong> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1d3/279/56d/1d327956d4b1d8d9df3b772691ebd932.png"></div><br>  <i>Data and observations collected at PlayExpo London.</i>  <i>I love spreadsheets.</i> <br><br>  We added to the demo assembly a code for collecting metrics about the results of battles, the frequency of choosing each character and ability, and various information about the time of using the UI.  This definitely helped us and allowed us to come from a scientific point of view to measuring the impact of the changes we made.  But probably the main part of the lessons was received in the good old way "to watch the player from the side and keep handwritten notes." <br><br>  None of us was an expert in the UX (and unofficially this article was called ‚Äú7 mistakes in UX that we could avoid‚Äù).  Like most development teams that do not have a separate UI / UX specialist, we tried to follow common sense and follow the simplest recommendations.  But when you so deeply immerse yourself in your own project, it is difficult to objectively evaluate all of its roughness.  The fresh look of the new pleisters is incredibly valuable - use them as often as possible! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/423637/">https://habr.com/ru/post/423637/</a></p>
