The forecast itself was published in May, and in particular it was presented by the representative of 1C-Bitrix Maria Sysoykina at the Big Media-Communication Forum. <br><br>  Thus, according to the forecast, already by 2016, 2.71 million people will work remotely in Russia, of which 642,000 will use IT solutions: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bc4/62a/226/bc462a22647a4cc1a7cb794a0da83dec.jpg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a>

      The largest number of "remote" among programmers and employees of customer support departments: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/388/081/987/388081987ef7487f97f0003d7fdd32c7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And this is how the structure of the Russian remote work market looks like by area of ‚Äã‚Äãactivity: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8d1/153/871/8d115387173e4e4f96f5fcb1e12eb3fc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Moving away from the numbers, we can say that people who prefer to work remotely are the so-called ‚Äúgeneration Y‚Äù - people who were born after 1981 and used to use modern digital technologies for their entire adult life. <br><br>  Psychologists explain the tendency to work remotely, not so much economic as social aspects.  So, Dr. Larry Nilsson <a href="http://www.heraldextra.com/news/article_3db6743c-35bc-5e6a-a737-938b93f57ac3.html">writes</a> in his work that Generation Y is people who mature for a long time, more often stay with their parents and delay the transition into adulthood for as long as possible.  In the same place, Dr. Nilsson writes that generation Y has a bad example of their parents in front of their eyes when one or even both parents were rarely at home.  Based on all these factors, representatives of Generation Y are skeptical about the prospect of working in an office. <br><br>  According to <a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/health/wellness/story/2012-03-15/Millennials-might-not-be-so-special-after-all-study-finds/53552744/1">research</a> at the University of Michigan, generation Y was strongly influenced by the appearance of home consoles.  If the representatives of the previous generation, ‚Äúbaby boomers‚Äù, had to go outside to play or go to the hall of automata, then the generation of ‚Äúecho boomers‚Äù, as generation Y is called, could already be played at home.  Based on this, people who grew up with the NES, Sega or Sony Playstation are more prone to the tendency to work remotely. <br><br>  It may seem that all people of generation Y, who spent their childhood with a prefix, are sociopaths, and therefore prefer to work at home, but the American Association for the Advancement of Science <a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-08/asa-law080613.php">believes</a> this is not entirely true.  According to the research of this organization, only 2% of the generation Y can be attributed to sociopaths, since these people are characterized by ‚Äútrophy hunting‚Äù, which, in turn, is formed under the influence of consoles. <br><br>  This is also confirmed by Ron Alson in his work ‚ÄúThe Trophy Kids Grow Up: How Millennial Generation is Shaking Up the Workplace‚Äù, however, emphasizing that the emphasis is placed on the fact that ‚Äúthere are no losers - everyone, even the runner to the finish line, has your trophy. " <br><br>  In his other work, Ron Alson writes that it is quite natural that the generation after 1981 prefers to work in IT, often remotely, and also that they tailor the work to their life, unlike the previous generation, which did the opposite.  In the same place, Alson writes that it is common for such people to change jobs frequently. <br><br>  The Pew Research Center‚Äôs research on generation Y says that one of the first questions these people ask themselves when they see a phenomenon or object is ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt you do it remotely / think up how to do it with the help of technology? ".  An example is the story of Mark Zuckerberg, a prominent representative of this generation, who was born in 1984 and wondering, ‚ÄúIs it possible to transfer social connections to the Internet?‚Äù Created Facebook in his room. <br><br>  In conclusion, it is worth saying that according to forecasts, based on a survey of leaders at the Global Leadership Summit, by 2020 half of the jobs in the world will be occupied by representatives of generation Y. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/291820/">https://habr.com/ru/post/291820/</a></p>
