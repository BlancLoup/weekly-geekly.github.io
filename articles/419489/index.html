If it's with batteries</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7c9/01c/747/7c901c7476c336324bc26d09f401ecc0.jpg" alt="Trailers are our everything!"></p><br><p>  A lot of copies have already been broken on the Internet, in smoking rooms and in the press about the timeliness / environmental friendliness / cost-effectiveness of cars in electric.  I'll insert my five kopecks, and maybe the whole hryvnia. </p><br><p>  To begin with, on a regular car with a gasoline engine I go to the suburbs every weekend, to my dacha ~ 50-60km in one direction, the cruising flow rate is ~ 90km / h.  In principle, this is quite an accessible distance at both ends, say, for the most common first-generation Nissan Leaf, even without recharging, if it were not for one BUT. </p><br><p>  Periodically, the traffic flow is somewhat slowed down by a UAZ vehicle, motorcycles with a sidecar, and what do you think?  Right!  Electric cars!  It is good if it drives 80 km / h, but when the car at the last kilowatt is slowly moving along the side of the road at dusk and without dimensions - this is a violation of traffic rules and a threat to traffic safety. </p><br><p>  And so, once again overtaking such a "freak" on an electric car (they are not to blame in general - the batteries of cars that came to our country at the end of the resource), the thought flashed through my head - he still lacked a trailer as "Zaporozhtsu" </p><a name="habracut"></a><br>  - and then BINGO !!!  This is IT!  What you need! Let me explain my joy, meaning some well-known shortcomings of electric vehicles: <br><br>  1. Battery weight - the same Nissan Leaf 1st gen.  it is about 300 kg, which increases the load on the chassis and, accordingly, reduces its service life or leads to an increase in cost. <br>  2. Long (relative to fueling) charge time - in order to travel from Kiev to Odessa, a car with an internal combustion engine takes 500 km of track 5-6 hours, an electric vehicle - 10-12, and then subject to the availability of ‚Äúfast‚Äù posts at the required points on track. <br>  3. Cost - the ‚Äúbattery‚Äù itself with a capacity of 24kW pulls up to $ 10,000 and repacking / replacing is also not cheap - in the end, at the price of a used electric car, you can buy a used car and 10 cubic meters of liquefied gas in coupons, which is enough for 100 thousand km.  run <br><br>  All these items are generally solved by transferring some of the batteries to the trailer - in fact, a supercar for an electric vehicle (hereinafter, for simplicity, I will take the capacity and battery characteristics of the first Lif for the basis):

      Consider the concept of creating a national electric car, or to hell with lithium! <br><br>  Without going into details, approximately (with an accuracy of about 10%), a battery with a capacity of 24 kilowatts requires 33 common lead-acid batteries 12V of standard capacity 60 ampere-hours and a total weight of 460 kilograms (14kg each) - ~ $ 1,300 + car trailer ~ 400 $.  As a result, having placed a third of the batteries in the car, we do not overload the suspension and get a mileage of several tens of kilometers, which is enough for the city.  The remaining batteries - ~ 310 kg + 180 kg of the trailer itself do not exceed the allowed towed weight for cars weighing 1 ton and add about a hundred kilometers of run. <br><br>  At a price, let's say ‚ÄúSens‚Äù (Lanos with a Ukrainian engine) at $ 6000, for 10 kilo-packs you can get a car with two battery trailers - With one drive, the other is charging / working in the green house system (the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsome auto concerns).  And having finished the mileage of the base car up to 50 / 60km, you can offer a trailer as an extra.  options. <br><br>  In the limit, this technology can give additional bonuses to electric vehicles - in the intercity the user only pays for renting / depreciating the energy trailer and consumed kilowatts, thereby eliminating the need for long-term charging (the same automakers still struggle with the problem of fast battery replacement at gas stations). <br><br>  The trailer itself can be aerodynamic (although with the size of the battery, the main costs will be for the transmission, if you remove the sides), and having calculated its suspension for a fixed load, you can reduce energy consumption to a minimum. <br><br>  Turning to lithium and equipping it with its own braking system (to realize recuperation), one can easily step up to a run of 300-500 km on one charge.  By the way, the trailer itself will indeed turn out much more compact - 24 marked batteries are placed on one square meter against two squares of area for a standard passenger sample. <br><br>  By placing on the trailer a kilowatt "daisy" from solar panels, you can get an independent power system for the dacha and not wait for the arrival of eco-houses from Tesla, Nissan-a and BMW. <br><br>  Naturally, any medal has two sides, let's look at the shortcomings of the ‚Äúlead‚Äù energy trailers: <br><br>  1. Lead batteries have a greater weight per unit capacity (in theory, 4 times), almost as we see - in one and a half. <br>  2. The impossibility of ‚Äúfast‚Äù charging - a maximum of 20% with a current is 8 hours - and yes, 10% below the efficiency against lithium batteries, although nominally lithium is also desirable to charge slowly - the battery then accumulates more charge. <br>  3. The number of charge cycles - the theory is at variance with practice - in fact, 400 cycles for lead versus 1000 for lithium (think of your smartphone or laptop). <br><br>  Of course, manufacturers of electric vehicles in every way try to veil the conventional charge cycles after the battery life, but the economy should be economical (we remember;), so the cost of a 100km trip on electricity is: <br><br>  If we take even $ 1600 and 400 cycles for lead batteries - it turns out $ 4 per cycle, we add to this amount the cost of 30 kilowatts for the population (based on an efficiency of 80%) we get $ 6 per 150 kilometers.  Do you think Leaf is doing better?  Minimum price is new!  $ 5000 batteries, though the number of cycles is three times more, and even if we take the battery efficiency of 100%, <br>  profit will be 50 cent.  On the same money, "average economic" in terms of fuel consumption, the European Logan 1.2 on gasoline will pass just a hundred kilometers, on gas - the same distance. <br>  Accordingly, the electric car itself for the end customer should be no more expensive than a gasoline one.  In Europe, there are state subsidies for buyers, and India, for example <br>  released the $ 2500 electric Tata Nano - there are ways, we just don‚Äôt want to follow them. <br><br>  No, I do not agitate for transport with the engine, just comparing.  Now the issue of environmental pollution - even in developed countries, the battery packs that have not been used in cars are not disposed of, but are being offered to be used in eco-house systems, so far we only come to this, <br>  but recycling and disposal of lead-acid batteries is a well-known and working technology, in addition, there are ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù charge / discharge controllers and desulfation techniques that prolong their life. <br><br>  At the output, we have the advantage of lithium blocks only in weight. <br><br>  PS Again, in support of my words, I want to point out that we have everything (that is, it was) - confirmation of the fact that the Lanos Pick-UP is electrically powered - with a 15-kilowatt engine on eight lead-acid batteries. <br><br>  But AvtoZAZ curtailed the production of passenger cars - as usual, everything merged ... as the same brand that could have been our answer Tate was no longer producing in the pursuit of profit from the release of ZAZ Forza, the New Luaz 1301, already ready for production and past factory tests, the program turned to release the capacity under the assembly of the VAZ 2110 - now no Zhiguli, <br>  nor its SUV, the Kiev Motor Plant - well, yes, here as usual, BURGERS are to blame. <br>  What in the end?  There is no domestic automobile industry, and there is a tax to protect it, and it really increases the price even once for cars produced by us, and hence the wave of cars on Euroballs. <br><br>  Why produce non-competitive cars?  You ask, and I don‚Äôt call for this - let's do what we can and we can do - we have a lot of manufacturers of trailers and lead-acid batteries, just need to combine these two things into a power trailer, equip existing electric cars with towbars and corresponding connectors .  After all, the trailer is already a thing certified for road traffic, and what we carry in it is potatoes, cement or batteries ‚Äî it doesn't matter, the main thing is not to exceed the permissible 750kg of total weight, and yes, to get the necessary 400 Volt, all 33 batteries are needed which said at the beginning;) <br><br>  PS At the weekend, Testil Renault Kangoo on electric (stuffing Lif, only 44kW batteries) - more boring than a seventy-five petrol car, in this Ilon Musk is right - the electric car should be bright and dynamic, give emotions.  But the carrying capacity - 1200 kg - by loading the distance Kiev-Odessa with lead batteries (450 km), you can go on one charge! <br><br>  Thanks for attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/419489/">https://habr.com/ru/post/419489/</a></p>
