But collect information about the release of new albums, singles, movies, TV shows, etc.  from different sources, to put it mildly, is not very convenient.  You can say that there are thematic communities in LiveJournal and other social networks, specialized poster sites, Wikipedia finally.  But you really tried to use them?  Do you know when the new Madonna album will be released, for example, or how long to wait until the release of the new season of ‚ÄúDoctor House‚Äù? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Unfortunately, there is still no one convenient site that would allow you to quickly and easily get information about upcoming events in the world of cinema, TV, music, games, etc. Highly specialized portals, such as tracking new episodes of the series, do not count. <br><br>  Such a site should be served by several editors - experts in their fields, who would collect information from sites of publishing houses, film companies, production centers, sites of musicians, communities in social networks and any other sources. <br><br>  All information should be processed and laid out in a single format in a common tape.  It is possible that some rss feeds will be processed automatically, but it is impossible to do without the work of editors who will add related information and monitor the quality and accuracy of information.

      Independent musicians, filmmakers and other creative people can be given the opportunity to independently upload information about releases of their own works in a separate tape.  The most popular, according to visitors, from here will automatically fall into the general tape. <br><br>  Associated information should be published for each note: links to interesting reviews, articles in magazines, websites of creators, publishers, TV channels, excerpts of compositions, movie trailers, book chapters, links to stores where it could be easily purchased, etc. <br><br>  For each type of content, it is advisable to publish additional information about related releases.  For example, for a movie in addition to the release of the film itself, it is desirable to separately publish the output on dvd and blueray, the appearance of voice acting or subtitles. <br><br>  Users can customize the tape for themselves, specifying only what they like.  This will allow you to track the releases of your favorite authors. <br>  At the same time, analyzing the user's preferences, the system will offer him content that might interest him: musicians of the same styles and popularity, similar films, games of the same genres, series from the creators of this and that and so on. <br>  In the comments to the notes, people will be able to discuss releases. <br><br>  Visitors to the site will post their scores on releases along with expert editors.  The final assessment of the release will consist of several factors: the rating of the users of the site, the rating of the editors of the site, and some of the information gathered by the editors: ratings of independent experts, reviews of reviewers, ratings of people around the world (based on the amount of money earned by the release), etc. <br><br>  Here is a site for me, really not enough. <br>  If you know about the existence of such a project or are planning to develop something like this - write about it in the comments and attach a link.  Let's discuss.  Thank. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/97835/">https://habr.com/ru/post/97835/</a></p>
