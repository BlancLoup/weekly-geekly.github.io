  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A website with a domain name in five minutes. Those who want on their own and make a website for free</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We have long been looking for professionals in Russia to redesign our website <a href="http://www.rustalk.net/">www.RusTalk.net</a> .  I communicated with the simplest and cheapest designers on freelancing and with the most expensive in our beloved country - with the studio of Artemy Lebedev.  Here, too, guys are interesting.  Their website development starts with a number for which you can buy a one-room apartment in the Moscow region or Porsche Caen or a small villa in Cuba.  In general, gentlemen, I am fine with big numbers, but here it‚Äôs obviously overkill.  And I found a way to make a website for free, at a good level and very simple methods. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I needed to make a website for another business.  As usual, I started by registering a domain.  I usually register all domains on <a href="http://www.1and1.com/">www.1and1.com</a> .  The service is excellent, one of the leaders in this industry, everything is simple and cheap.  There are many additional options.  When registering my domain, I was offered a number of additional services, and I noticed a service called MyBusiness site.  In this service, you are offered 3 months of subscription for free and then you have to pay $ 9.99 per month.  The service includes the following <br><br>  Choose your design from optimized layouts for over 125 types of businesses <br><br>  Programming skills required! 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Your website is up-to-date. <br><br>  Unlimited pages, web space, and traffic <br><br>  FREE domain name and E-mail addresses included <br><br>  No hidden fees! <br><br>  I subscribed to this offer.  Quickly registered a domain name and moved to the part on the development of the site.  I just wanted to see, because I thought that it would take me more than one day.  And the technical aspects of the project are usually performed by assistants.  I started watching the site development service.  I was asked to choose the business sector in which I would do my project.  After choosing, I was offered several different options for the ‚Äúfish‚Äù of the site, I chose one option, clicked the ‚ÄúOK‚Äù button and immediately there appeared an almost ready site in front of me, with typed content, with the contacts I asked, with a page where we can write a letter.  Then, using the built-in CMS, for the uninitiated, this system controls various records and images on your website, edited some places.  Everything, as a first approximation, the site was ready.  Another company 1and1.com offers a site optimization service to host its search engines, but I left this part for later.  I wanted to do it after reading the book ‚ÄúSearch Engine Optimization‚Äù by Ivan Sevastyanov.  My goal has been achieved.  After one hour of sitting at the computer, I received a working website <a href="http://www.acteonservice.com/">www.acteonservice.com</a> , a working e-mail address for contacts, and all this was free for me.  I have one month to evaluate this service and if I don‚Äôt like it, I‚Äôll refuse to use it in the future.  I want to say to the respected website builders who poorly make and cheap websites in the Russian Federation: your time is coming to an end.  Soon the first grader will make the site itself in a class on labor education. <br>  Gentlemen, if you know such services, please write.  I think this will be useful information for many people.  The only question that remains open to me is: how can I put our system for online consulting <a href="http://www.rustalk.net/">www.RusTalk.net</a> on my website?  It is necessary to embed a couple of lines in the page, but here you need to ‚Äúget inside‚Äù the site.  But I will call my admin now, and he will do it in minutes. <br><br>  Follow the news on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/rustalk">www.twitter.com/rustalk</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/107708/">https://habr.com/ru/post/107708/</a></p>
