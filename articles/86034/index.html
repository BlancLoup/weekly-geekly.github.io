  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Opinion about the first conference of web developers in the Urals UWDC 2010</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Greetings to everyone, now, early in the morning at work, after 2.5 sleepless nights (I wrote yesterday), while I am still able to think, I decided to express my opinion on the past UWDC 2010 (First Ural Web Developer Conference).  I would like to tell you what was there.  And to make jealous of those who did not appear there) <a name="habracut"></a><br>  For starters, I wanted to express my gratitude to <i>Anton Rozhkov, aka Aneto</i> , for the help in registering a room and organizing such a magnificent event. I would also not like to forget other people who participated in organizing this event, but I cannot name everyone by name. <br>  So!  I was pleased with the Hotel Hollyday in Chelyabinsk, 4 stars - this is not for you in slippers ... ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ <br><br>  Very comfortable and pleasant hotel, with excellent service staff, if I travel through Chelyabinsk, I will only stay there.  ))) <br><br>  And now for the speakers.

      <b>Google, Mikhail Ovchinnikov</b> - told us about the services offered by Google, the presentation was at a decent level.  But the narrator surprised me, after the presentation of the report on the topic ‚ÄúAnalyzing the effectiveness of the site using Google Analytics‚Äù, being lost in response to my question: ‚ÄúWhat are the advantages of Google‚Äôs analytical services over their counterparts from Yandex‚Äù. <br>  Guys are not allowed!  You go to present, be prepared to answer any questions, the more obvious. <br><br>  <b>1.Ru, Sergey Efimov and Alexey Grachev.</b>  I liked the subject of the report very much, it was always interesting for me to see it live and hear the answers to the questions about how they came to such a life.  And also to listen how it is arranged inside, such a huge project as e1.ru.  Thank you very much it was very interesting! <br><br>  <b>UMI-CMS, Ignat Tolchanov</b> , at first another topic was stated, and it was very interesting for me to listen to the marketing calculations related to this cms, I even had some questions prepared, maybe I considered buying an online store on this cms.  But unfortunately the topic was changed to ‚ÄúHow easy it is to develop umi.cms‚Äù and, coupled with a rotten speaker, the presentation became unbearable and I could not wait for it to finish. <br><br>  <b>Comrades from Yandex!</b>  They are really good!  I would like to especially note the speeches of Anton Zabannykh and Andrei Karmatsky.  Everything was magnificently told, presented, and aroused great interest in products from Yandex, and not only me.  By the end of the presentation of the report on api Yandex maps, it seemed that everyone was silent, so as not to ‚Äúburn the topic‚Äù, but now they‚Äôll jerk at writing services based on Yandex Mep!  The story about Yandex widgets is also very much, although the topic is not complicated, but the guys have completely revealed everything. <br><br>  Slightly <b>saddened by the</b> report <b>74.Ru, Eduard Ivanov ‚ÄúOptimization of web applications for PHP‚Äù</b> .  The report was clearly "sucked from the finger" and did not reveal any secrets was a brief overview of optimization schemes, no more than 5 minutes.  Very sorry ( <br><br>  <b>Turbomilk</b> is a very interesting project idea, I've been watching you for a long time, but the presentation is below average.  ((Such a creative company must be able to represent itself. <br><br>  <b>Microsoft Gaidar Magdanurov</b> .  O Gaidar!  You are wonderful!  I have not met a more magnificent speaker!  This is not the first time I've attended a Microsoft product presentation, and they always delighted me.  But your reports are beyond praise.  It is a pity that you had only 3 reports.  Your presentations even inclined me to the dark side)).  Thank you very much.  Very high quality and interesting. <br><br>  There was another Jedi, he was not listed in the program and was the last to speak.  It is always nice to listen to people who know their business.  The report was on the topic of search engine optimization.  Let the secrets of the universe have not been disclosed, but to listen to a professional is always interesting, especially when you can ask a couple of questions. <br><br>  There were many other speakers and interesting topics, but I don‚Äôt even remember all of them.  All well done.  )) <br><br>  In general, I liked the Conference very much; developers from Moscow, St. Petersburg, Yekaterinburg, Orenburg, Magnitogorsk (myself from this glorious city), and a lot of small cities gathered for it. <br>  <b>There was a very good atmosphere,</b> good booze between the first and second day of the conference at the Holiday Hotel. <br>  There were people who found a new job.  Everything went very interesting, it is a pity that everything was already over!  <b>It is necessary to carry out such activities more often</b> . <br>  This greatly broadened my horizons, made it possible to see the developers umi.cms, netcat, e1.ru, 74.ru, as well as representatives of such companies Microsoft, yandex, google and others !!! <br>  There was an opportunity to communicate with the steep peppers, plowing the same field as me. <br><br><h4>  Many thanks to the organizers! </h4></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/86034/">https://habr.com/ru/post/86034/</a></p>
