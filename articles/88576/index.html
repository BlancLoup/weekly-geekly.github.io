      Well, to the point: we have successfully completed a little more than a month and are happy to talk about the results. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  First of all, it‚Äôs about the topical: we changed our office for a cheaper, but no less cool one.  Now we are sitting behind the wall of a local provider, so that we have a volatile and inexpensive Internet.  Albeit a twisted pair, but from the server, to which the 50-megabit channel clogged up to 20-30% to Samara, and there already there is nothing else - in short, the Internet flies with us and costs money like home Akado in Moscow. <br><br>  Secondly, about money: in a month we recaptured 20% of the funds invested in the development.  It seems that another month of such work and we will go to zero on costs (people-wheelbarrow-office-communication-Internet-advertising).  That is, it‚Äôs not yet going to fight back the previously invested, but the Upominator will also eat (the term ‚Äúoperating profit‚Äù is familiar to us, but not the fact that it is familiar to everyone :-)) exactly as much as it earns. <br><br>  As already mentioned in the previous issues of this blog - we (the project team) are sitting in the village, so the costs are completely incomparable with Moscow ones.  As a result - with the proper formulation of the case ... we feel that we will quickly become a city-forming enterprise, a desirable employer and all that jazz. <br><br>  <b>Other news:</b> <br>  1. Iron carry in Frankfurt.  SpaceWeb is a good provider, but it‚Äôs not ready to do the things we need.  In addition, the history of iFolder tells us: ‚Äúget out of here‚Äù.  Well, we piled up: the server (I <a href="http://www.fujitsu.com/global/services/computing/server/ia/rackserver/rx200_s2.html">‚Äôm not going to fuck Siemens with this word</a> ) and live 100 megabits to <a href="http://www.level3.com/">Level3</a> optics. <br><br>  2. Payment systems: contracts are in the process of signing, by the end of the second month of work we can pay ... but anything other than cash.  That is, any of the working and adequate payment systems of the RuNet will be connected to us by direct contract (without gaskets). <br><br>  3. Payments to the mentions: the entire first month of work, we made payments, without withdrawing our commissions, in order to please our new partners. <br><br>  4. Advertisers.  As we expected, our readiness to accept a white clearing settlement, as well as ZERO (unlike some of our colleagues), the replenishment commission led to several serious advertisers, some of which we will soon tell in more official press releases. <br><br>  5. Fighting inadequate.  First, funny advertisers.  They added their campaigns and got the audience represented by the mentions who offered their resources.  By this, they are organized.  To continue to exclude such a freebie, we prohibit the introduction of campaigns into the system at zero balance.  Secondly, ingenious reciters who immediately after receiving the money banged all the links on their resources.  Our quality control system is gaining momentum: it consists of 2 levels, the first is a machine that checks for links.  The second is people checking for references where the machine cannot verify them (podcasts, social networks, etc.).  A large purge is already beginning, the result of which is the blocking of the money earned, a ban on soap, the address of the resource, the purse number, in short, a complete obstruction. <br><br>  <b>Thanks:</b> <br>  Thanks for the tips and advice.  With them, we get better much faster. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/88576/">https://habr.com/ru/post/88576/</a></p>
