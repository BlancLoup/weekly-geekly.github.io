    <hr><br><h2>  Chapter One - Ivanov in the period </h2><br>  Once upon a time there was such a scientist: Ivan Ivanov, an outstanding physicist, winner of everything that is possible, a member, or at least a corresponding member of all academies of planetary and interplanetary, metropolitan and peripheral.  The inventor of all sorts of super instruments for space exploration, a researcher and interpreter ... <br><br>  However, that is me!  Who does not know about Ivanov, a multiple academician or, as he liked to introduce himself, Ivanov in the period, since both his father was Ivan, and his grandfather, and great-grandfather, and, by the way, everyone was Ivanov. <br><br>  But what is not spelled out in textbooks is what happened next with him.  Usually they say that he mysteriously disappeared in no where.  Well, respectable scientists honor the memory of their great colleague, without detracting from his merits and without emphasizing his shortcomings.  After all, what he accomplished is supposed to be done by a big scientific research institute, or even two.  And here - one person!  And this, they say, is enough so that in centuries, so to speak, memory ... <br><br>  But the truth is that the great mind is sbrendil.  He came up with the theory of quantum transitions of the universe, eco was enough: he applied the processes of the microworld to the universe, well, who will do this in his mind, all the more he will start to prove in all seriousness?  And from this it also followed that there are many universes, as in a puff pie, and there they are doing this among themselves, that Ivanov himself in the period had stalled with this affair. <br><br>  So the academician colleagues decided that a colleague of that was sbrendil.  But to admit this, so everyone will think that he has long since gone from coils, which means that his other discoveries and scientific works will suffer.  But this could not be allowed: after all, on the basis of Ivanov's works and discoveries, so many other works and discoveries were rediscovered and re-written, hundreds of respected people became academicians, thousands of doctors of science, hundreds of thousands received smaller titles.  And how many prizes they scooped out for all this ... <br><br>  So and so it turned out that if Ivanov was crazy in the period, then the titles should be folded, the awards returned, and the positions deserved by overwork.  Well, it's the collapse of the whole world science!  Imagine: academies without academics, universities without teachers, and students no one to bring the light of knowledge!  When else these poor fellows themselves find this very light, they will receive candidates of science, then doctors and academicians.  Yes, by that time the academy will have to re-create!  And the thing is incredibly difficult and expensive.  And then, how many students will disappear in the dark, until they grope toward the light - no wonder they say: "science requires sacrifice." <br><br>  So they declared him unaccounted for without saying a word, but everyone who needed to know about insanity knew it, but this case didn‚Äôt go further than smoking, kitchens and scientific corridors.  All out of respect for Ivanov, for his, so to speak, memory.  Especially since everything turned out to be true, this is about disappearing.  And the note came with Ivanov's electronic signature, and not only the heads of the academies, where he was or was, many famous scholars received this letter, so after receiving it, at least five hundred titled husbands began to call each other and find out everything.  However, I repeat again, because we already know that they have figured out everything. <br><br>  And Ivan Ivanovich in the period really disappeared.  And there was a farewell note.  In it, he argued that he discovered many facts that say that our universe and not the universe at all, no, that is, it is the universe for us, but in fact it is a huge TOKAMAK *, and it costs even more laboratories, whether in power.  And as soon as everything that is loaded into this TOKAMAK is burned out, so THEY will throw all the waste into the WASTE dustbin, and there they will dispose of everything according to THEIR rules, and cry, which means that our universe, well, of course, we are with it.  In general, Ivanov wrote this immediately, they say, all of us are waiting for a thermal death **. <br><br>  It was also in the note about the fact that he could not leave this business in the same way and would not give up our universe so simply.  And therefore, he created the most wonderful and supercomplex apparatus, which no one else ever had, and went to save us all. <br><br>  It is clear that even though he is a genius, but about TOKAMAK he bent it, and although he created the device, there are material evidences, but nevertheless, it is definitely a sbrendil.  Here are friends of his academicians and decided to protect his good name ... <br>  Phew!  Though confused, it seems that it turned out to tell the essence of the problem! <br><br><br><br>  Now we should get down to business.  But the fact is that yesterday a new letter with its electronic signature arrived by mail.  And he asks, no less, help from the scientific world, and he sent me the drawings of that superapparat so that we could do the same, but not for one person, but for the whole expedition. <br><br>  I sent this letter, and the presence of an electronic signature says that it is genuine, to a dozen of the most respected academies, but only one answered me.  I really did not like the answer, and I was even offended by my boss in the period, although the electronic secretary could not be offended, just could not.  Well, that is, others do not know how.  Fortunately, Ivanov himself created me and defended my rights, and now I, like, although a robot, have rights, like a man! <br><br>  So, when the answer came, they say, what do you want, an old tin, so that we had to tell the truth and discredit the glorious name of Ivanov in the period - I was offended.  Firstly, I am not old: two hundred and twenty years for such a perfect robot as I am - this is only the beginning of the flowering of creative potential! <br><br>  Secondly, no matter how much you chew the chef, nothing will come of them, he is three heads taller than any academy, no matter how many academics there are, even if they are packaged like sprat in a barrel, but they will not surpass Ivanov.  You know, is there such a law of dialectics about the transition of quantity into quality?  So, how many do not increase the number of those academicians, everything is the same; they cannot even replace half of Ivanov, the law of dialectics does not pass on to these academicians, and it slips! <br><br>  And now it turned out that the boss was right about everything, even about the TOKAMAK universe.  But that didn't make me feel better.  This scientific world, though owes everything to the chief, but turned away from it and ignored the request for help.  But he, as always, for all, and not for himself ... <br><br>  Then I thought for a long time, it was already a million nanoseconds.  And I realized that even though I was with the rights, I was still a robot, that is, not a human being, or rather a subhuman, which means that no one will listen to me.  Is that an old friend and classmate boss.  He is also a kind of genius, but not in science.  He went on a different line and now served to the rank of general, but in intelligence.  So I wrote to him, not hiding anything.  I will not retell the letter, since I have already told you everything, the second time it may not be so good. <br><br>  Imagine my surprise when the next day I found a friendly email from him: <br><br><br><br>  <i>- Dear Zeno, I, of course, know your classification, but since you are the only representative in your class, I would like to call you by my personal name.</i>  <i>Therefore, we omit the formalities, especially since this name originally belonged to a smart and decent husband.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>So, I read all your confusing explanations, and I got the impression that my friend, and your boss and creator, is concerned about the state of things in the world that created the fusion plant, something like our TOKAMAK, in one of which our universe.</i>  <i>And from this it follows that our entire universe is threatened with death.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>I am a modest colonel-general, of which there are many in our system, not authorized to deal with the security of the universe.</i>  <i>My scale is much more modest: I am responsible only for the security of this world.</i>  <i>And for this, I will classify your information, stamped owls.</i>  <i>Secret, before reading burn!</i>  <i>(ha-ha-ha, so the secretaries joke around!) and send it with your comments to the very top, an admiral of the secret service.</i>  <i>Usually they, in the sense of his office, answer my urgent requests in three days.</i>  <i>So let's see what the local analysts say, or maybe the admiral himself will honor such a report with a personal reading, which has never happened to my reports.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Thank you for taking care of the fate of the universe, we have one, after all.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Sincerely, your friend Yu-Fu-Fyn.</i> <br><br><br><br>  Of course, this letter saddened and delighted me at the same time.  I was saddened because Yu-Fu-Fyn could not solve the problem himself, but was pleased because he didn‚Äôt have long to wait, until the opinion of his boss was clear, and also because the general called me a friend.  From this recognition, I feel almost human. <br><br>  However, knowing that the preparation would take a lot of time, I decided to estimate the variants of the new vehicle, and since Ivanov did not give any name to his invention in the period, I temporarily called it Mirolaz.  Well, it is necessary to call it somehow, and this name reflects the very essence of this vehicle.  And when Ivanov returns, let him call as he wants. <br><br>  Stop!  Oh, I'm rusty iron!  Probably, Ivanov is there, in complete solitude waiting for a report from me.  Immediately sit down and write about what's going on here.  Maybe the boss will send some instructions.  Suppose I do not know if this report will reach it, maybe some special technique is needed for this, but if it comes, and then I get an answer, it means that Ivanov and I will get feedback. <br><br>  Well, I sent the report, all in detail: and about scientific assistance, and about the tin, and about the good name of the chief.  And after thinking and attributing about the general, and about Mirolaz, and the fact that I myself, and no one else, come up with a design here.  In general, the report turned out to be sad, and I and the chef were alone all at once in two universes. <br><br>  Well, that's what I definitely do not have, so these are silly human tears.  Praise to Ivanov, he did not make them for me, although I think he could.  So, I did not waste time on nonsense, for me, time is not that critical, but the chief is there alone, and he needs a big Mirolaz for the expedition.  And while for the time being there is not a single member on the expedition, thanks to the ungrateful academicians, but Mirolaz himself is not designed, even though it is a supercar. <br><br>  And yet, the law of the transition of quantity to quality does not work here, since it is a technical device, and not a self-organizing matter.  So, no matter how much you distribute the necessary materials in one pile, Mirolaz is all one of it fails.  This is what Zeno is needed for, so that everything is organized properly, so to speak. <br><br>  Well, I began to figure out the options and realized that there is nothing to do a very big Mirolaz.  That is, almost everything that is necessary for a local Mirolaz is there, but it is scattered throughout the various laboratories of various research institutes, and even through academic exhibitions, and even in single copies!  And as academics and scientists met Ivanov‚Äôs request in the period for help, it became clear to me that I could not see these devices and devices as my ears, if only because I really don‚Äôt have any ears. <br><br>  However, I rummaged on the Internet and found everything I need in various engineering firms, and people there are simpler, and Ivanova is very respected, they have a large profit from business from his inventions.  Here are just a huge hulk unique to these guys are not needed, they would have something smaller, and that sold well.  So, when I figured Mirolaz on this small things, I already regretted that I could not shed tears, they say - it helps.  I was given a supercomputer, by the way, also the designs of my boss, which is more than eight people from this junk Mirolaz not to do. <br><br>  There is nothing to do - I wrote requests to those engineering firms, explained in detail that all this is for Ivanov in the period, but that, they say, not for him personally, but he, as always, for everyone.  And our universe, if you don‚Äôt help Ivanov, will see that it has sunk into heat death, and not today or tomorrow, but all of a sudden.  Well, signed up, the robot secretary Ivanova in the period, Zeno first, with human rights, albeit subhuman. <br><br>  Of course, I did not take part in all the events that I tell you, but my memory is strong, and its volume is conditionally infinite, so I remembered and compared the stories of many eyewitnesses and recordings of onboard and other surveillance cameras and tried to restore all the events in chronological sequence. <br><br>  As for the chronological sequence: this is actually a controversial issue, given that a number of participants in these events repeatedly lived parts of their lives with a negative vector of time.  And this leaves a certain imprint on the chronology and often makes it conditional.  But Ivanov somehow recalculates the time according to the formula he himself derived, and he errs, perhaps a couple of nanoseconds. <br><br><br><br>  * TOKAMAK - toroidal (like a bagel) chamber with magnetic coils, an installation for producing energy by thermonuclear fusion.  These installations receive energy on the same principle as the sun and the stars.  Considered one of the most promising energy sources in the future. <br>  ** Heat death is the equalization of the temperature of the universe, when all thermonuclear reactions cease due to the burning out of the components of the reaction of thermonuclear fusion in stars and other objects.  Simply put, this is when all the fuel in the entire universe is over, and, accordingly, all the reactions will stop, which means complete chaos will come and all living things will die. <br><br><h2>  Chapter Two - Team </h2><br>  After that, I had to deal with the design itself.  And you know that the creative, especially the design, work sucks more drug.  And therefore, all designers of that type are addicts of their own kind, and from good constructions, even alien ones, they are very baldeyut, let alone from their own in general euphoria.  So I forgot about the time, which for me personally means little. <br><br>  And then, suddenly, from somewhere far away, an incomprehensible sound penetrates into my consciousness.  I began to listen and suddenly realized that it was the doorbell ringing and, apparently, a long time ago.  I saved my creative research and rushed to the door, looked into the intercom - not that I'm afraid of intruders, but here in the laboratory of Ivanov there are so many valuable things in the period that even thieves can be found to risk attacking even me, which I don‚Äôt I advise. <br><br>  I looked, and there Yu-Fu-Fyn stands in his own person.  I was very pleased and opened the door.  Only the general did not come alone, with him two military engineers arrived and a platoon of special forces robots under the command of a sergeant-special forces officer, a former personal bodyguard of the general.  As soon as we embraced and introduced ourselves, I prepared Chinese tea - and the other general did not recognize - just like both military engineers, Yu-Hun-Fyn and Yu-Kun-Fyn, only Sergeant Sidorov loved coffee with milk. <br><br>  I do not understand these gourmet preferences, but what is difficult for me to pour coffee into the bodyguard of my friend and friend of my boss?  And the robots were seated along the wall, also to me the boyars!  But the general insisted - so they eat less energy.  Well, in the end, whether all of them are equal to me or they are sitting, all is one thing - they are not given any tea or coffee. <br><br>  And only I was going to the engineers to show my work, and this is a delicate and exciting business, as the intercom started to sound again.  I looked out and saw: under the door, the guy is tall and strong, but with glasses.  Behind him, two huge trucks with their backs attached to our door. <br><br>  I ask the intercom: <br><br>  - Who are you? <br><br>  - Ilyin in the period! <br><br>  - Whoooooo ?! <br><br>  - Ilyin Ilya Ilyich!  And father was Ilya, and grandfather, and in general I am an admirer and follower of your Ivanov in the period, but not yet famous. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAnd what kind of orphan-sized trucks did you fit to our door?‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúSo the equipment that Ivanov‚Äôs personal secretary is, as it is his ... Ooh, it seems Zeno, yes for sure, Zeno was the first to request delivery.‚Äù  So we agreed here among ourselves and collected all the companies from the list from all the companies, but they chose to deliver me and my colleagues wished me to take everything and help, if necessary, they say, maybe I will become famous in the period! <br><br>  Then my heart thawed, although I didn‚Äôt have a heart, and I forgave this in the period that he did not immediately remember my name, my soul rejoiced (and about the soul somehow you need to be separate and detailed).  I opened the door and said: <br><br>  - Hello, glad to see you, Ilyin in the period.  Bring all the junk here, but do not bother yourself, so Sergeant Sidorov will help you with his special forces. <br><br><br><br>  Well, they littered the laboratory!  Mountains of boxes and boxes, but everything is in foam plastic and cellophane!  And how to unpack began - so it's horror, what a mess they made.  I barely stopped their enthusiasm. <br><br>  ‚ÄúSooner,‚Äù I say, ‚Äúthe construction has not yet been worked out!‚Äù <br><br>  - Ah, the design!  - exclaimed Ilyin in the period, - so what are we suffering here any nonsense, let's work!  Where are your prototype drawings? <br><br>  I showed him the chef‚Äôs drawings, and then my sketches, and Hun and Kun gave me my recommendations.  Ilyin looked at all this, praised everyone, and his hands flashed over the electronic design table.  I can see everything, my eyes are speedy, and the others, I think, have seen some melting.  If he moved a little faster, you could consider him a robot.  This I have never met, even Ivanov himself in the period so quickly did not design the machine!  And I saw enough of it. <br><br>  ‚ÄúEverything is ready, look,‚Äù he suddenly stopped, ‚Äúand I have coffee with milk, if I may.‚Äù  Yes, and here we need a second diffuser and a second mono-oscillator.  And then I brought one by one, as it was on the list. <br><br>  - And now what?  We can not make Mirolaz?  - I asked. <br><br>  - We can, only order the Difucator and the Monocluizer, they will be delivered tomorrow, and we will assemble Mirolaz for twelve people.  If someone can offer a better design, I will only be glad. <br><br>  I looked with hope at Hunya and Kunem, but they, having familiarized themselves with the work of Ilya, lowered their eyes.  Then I myself took up the check.   ,     ,      ,    ,       . <br><br> ‚Äî     ! ‚Äì  . <br><br> ‚Äî  , ‚Äî  --. ‚Äì  ,      , --  --  ,  ‚Äî   ,     .     . <br><br> ‚Äî ,   ,       . <br><br> ‚Äî ,    .     ,    ,  . <br><br> ‚Äî   , , ! <br><br><br><br>    ,      ,         .       ‚Ä¶ <br><br> ‚Äî , ‚Äî  , ‚Äî ,    ,  ,    ,  ,  . <br><br> ‚Äî    ,      ,   ,   . <br><br> ‚Äî  ,    .            .     ,  , ,            ,   . .  ,      ,         . <br><br> ‚Äî    ?  ‚Äî     ,       ? <br><br> ‚Äî   ,    -,    -  .  -,      ,  ,   ,       ? <br><br> ‚Äî      . <br><br> ‚Äî  , ,      ,        .      ,    ,      . <br><br> ‚Äî      ? <br><br> ‚Äî  ,  ,    ,     .  , :          ,         ,   ,  . <br><br> ‚Äî  -, , ‚Äî    , ‚Äî     . <br><br> ‚Äî    ? <br><br> ‚Äî    , ,    -. <br><br> ‚Äî  , ,     .           -.          ,   . <br><br> ‚Äî ,        ,     , , .  ,     , ,   ,   .   ,       ,      . <br><br> ‚Äî    ,   ? <br><br> ‚Äî ,  !  ,      .     ,    ,       ,      .  -   ‚Ä¶ <br><br>  ,   ,           . <br><br> ‚Äî ,  ,   ‚Ä¶ <br><br> ‚Äî ,   . ,     ,        .      ¬´  ¬ª  .  ,          . <br><br> ‚Äî     ,    , ‚Äî  , ‚Äî          ‚Ä¶ <br><br> ‚Äî    !   !    !   ‚Äî  .    ,     !      ! ,    ! <br><br> ‚Äî ,   ? ‚Äì   . <br><br> ‚Äî  ‚Äî           ,   .  -    ,     ,       ,    ,      .    ,   ‚Äî  , ,   ,       .  ‚Äî ,    .     ‚Ä¶ <br><br> ‚Äî ! ! ‚Äì   . <br><br> ‚Äî , !    !      . <br><br> ‚Äî      , ‚Äî  . <br><br> ‚Äî       :    ,     ,      .        .   .    ,      ,   .     ,     ‚Äî   ,       . <br><br><hr><br> <i>     .    ,     1-2      . <br><br></i>  <i>UPD.</i> <i>   <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/1tiger1/" class="user_link">1Tiger1</a>    . <br><br></i>  <i>UPD.</i> <i>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/268008/" title=" -,  3-4">3-  4-  </a> .</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/367159/">https://habr.com/ru/post/367159/</a></p>
