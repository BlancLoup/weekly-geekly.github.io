  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The first results of innos in the Russian market</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In anticipation of the start of sales of the innos D6000 smartphone, the official blog of our brand on Geektimes.ru published material with <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/innos/blog/270252/">exhaustive details about innos</a> , as well as the most eyestory <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/innos/blog/273450/">review of innos D6000</a> .  We talked in detail about the innos brand, the D6000 model and all of its features, both as a whole and related to ensuring long battery life.  It is the presence of a large number of these very chips that make the innos D6000 the most thoughtful smartphone with a large battery.  Then began the Russian sales of smart.  About one and a half months have passed since the official release.  Well, it's time to report back - what, how and why happened during this period. <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/innos/blog/277070/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/048/50c/055/04850c05596780e9929d4c045dc9135f.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First of all, I would like to apologize to all those who pre-order it even in winter, and who eventually had to wait for their device until mid-April.  Initially, we planned to ‚Äúrelease‚Äù innos D6000 in mid-February, then postponed the start of sales to mid-March, and then - alas and oh - and to April.  Yes, it turned out really bad, and we sincerely regret what happened.  Conclusions for the future are made. <br><br>  We explain why it all happened that way.  In the process of preparing the launch of the innos D6000 in Russia, a number of certain formal issues related to the design of the payment acceptance procedure and the logistics of our devices in the territory of the Russian Federation and the countries of the former USSR surfaced.  For example, it turned out that when accepting payments there are problems with some - and quite common - types of plastic cards.

      The second reason is the desire to ‚Äúlick‚Äù the firmware of a smartphone to such a state that they can be used without any complaints in the territory of Russia and neighboring countries.  Of course, we have been monitoring the branches of popular forums since the fall discussing Chinese versions of innos D6000.  The owners of these devices, who ordered them on some Aliexpress, are often unhappy with their devices.  And the complaints concern, first of all, the software - and this is actually normal, since such instances are designed to operate in the Middle Kingdom and are sharpened for local (Chinese) realities.  So we "peretachivali" software under the Russian realities.  For example, they added support for LTE Band 38 and Band 40 that are relevant in Russia, with which the ‚ÄúChinese‚Äù are not friendly.  And, judging by the reviews on the forums and in technical support, the users were generally satisfied with our software works. <br><br>  Actually, these are the <b>reasons for the delay</b> .  It's nice that, as it turned out, consumers really waited for our device.  This conclusion follows at least from the fact that the conversion on pre-orders (that is, the percentage of those who bought from the number of those who issued the pre-order) was more than 25%.  For comparison: according to unofficial data, a number of Korean world-class companies, which also often offer to pre-order their flagships a couple of months before the start of sales, the conversion is usually no more than 10-15%.  We had an even better result - and this despite the delay, which, to our great regret, scared away some people and made them buy other devices.  (At this point we will return below.) At the same time, we managed to sell off almost the entire D6000 batch.  But, of course, now the devices are available, as well as the entire "collection" of accessories.  You can place an order <a href="http://www.innos.com/ru/">here</a> . <br><br>  Next, I would like to talk about the calls to technical support and the most common <b>questions</b> .  First, some innos D6000 users face a marriage.  We admit it, believe me, this is quite normal, and there is nothing to hide.  Everyone has a marriage, including grandees like Apple and Samsung, not to mention smaller guys, like HTC or Lenovo.  For the market, a marriage rate of up to 5% is considered a good indicator; moreover, 7% is also a quite tolerable indicator that even many global manufacturers cannot achieve.  In the case of innos D6000, about 1.5% of buyers sent requests for warranty repairs.  Of course, this is not the limit, since many received their devices less than a month ago, and the official guarantee, we recall, is a year.  Nevertheless, the result, in our opinion, is still quite encouraging.  And here again I would like to remind you of our service policy.  In case of warranty, we call the courier directly to the client‚Äôs house and pick up the device for repair, and after repairing it, return it to the user with the help of the same courier (all this, we emphasize, is free of charge if the device is under warranty).  In this case, the owner of innos D6000 can live in any settlement in the territory of Russia.  For comparison: very, very many A-brands open authorized SOs only in large cities.  As a result, the owner of the device, say, from Rostov-on-Don will be able to hand over the device for warranty repair without any problems, and the owner of the device from the <i>Rostov region</i> must go to the city for the delivery of the device.  Himself.  At your expense.  And waste time.  Feel the difference between this and our trips? <br><br>  If we talk about other common reasons for contacting support, we can single out, for example, problems with LTE operation.  As a result, as a rule, it turns out that the user previously had a smartphone without LTE support, and the SIM card was purchased three to five to seven years ago.  A person is in a hurry to blame innos for everything, but suddenly it turns out that you should just go to the operator's service point and change the SIM card to a modern one.  And everything starts to work sharply. <br><br>  Another frequently encountered request is the inability to connect innos D6000 to a computer on Windows 10. Like, ‚ÄúWindows‚Äù requires installing some drivers, and they are not found on the official innos website or on the Internet.  However, in the process of communicating with the user, it turns out that he doesn‚Äôt have the official Windows 10, but some kind of fan "lightweight" assembly, from which the mass of components has been removed.  What is there to say?  Use legal software in versions from developers, and there will be no problems.  Because our smartphone easily and naturally connects to computers on the original licensed Windows 10 without any drivers. <br><br>  Finally, very often ask about new <b>firmware</b> .  It is believed that a separate category of modern users need new firmware just like air.  You ask their interest for the sake of - they say, but what in the current firmware does not suit you?  (Yes, we are aware that there is no limit to perfection, and the software should be constantly improved, which we actually do.) But the user doesn‚Äôt announce any minuses, he just needs a new firmware.  Point.  Well, open the cards: on May 17, an update of the firmware based on Android 5.1.1 Lollipop was released, in which the algorithm of energy consumption was changed.  It used to be like this: external ‚Äúacc‚Äù was discharged to 85%, then internal to 85%, then external to 1%, then internal also ‚Äúemptied‚Äù to 1%.  In the new firmware everything is different: first, the external battery is up to 85%, then the internal one to 85%, then the external one to 5%, then the internal one to 1%, then the external one to 1%.  Additional laboratory tests have shown that it is this algorithm that is optimal and allows the battery to last the longest.  The remaining innovations in the screenshot: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/80d/6e2/de9/80d6e2de95844e2abb0967fa9ccf2627.png"><br><br>  By the way, users had some difficulties - let's call them that, although these are more likely nuances - with installing the above-described new firmware.  They say that the boys in the forums write that someone has already arrived on OTA software, and in the curtain of notifications there was an offer to download it and install it.  But nothing concrete arrived from Apatity Vasya!  Horror, injustice, there are crooks working in innos!  There are several reasons for this state of affairs.  First, updates spread in waves.  That is, not all D6000 instances receive an update at one time.  This is normal when one instance receives it, for example, on May 20, and another - 21. Thus, the load on the servers that distribute the update is reduced, which allows people to receive the highest download speed (the update weighs several hundred megabytes - not a cat wept !)  Samsung, LG, HTC, Xiaomi and so on according to the list.  Why suddenly innos should be different in this respect from all the others - it is not entirely clear, but ‚ÄúVasya from Apatity‚Äù seems to know better. <br><br>  Towards the middle of the summer, the promised firmware release based on Android 6.0 Marshmallow will be released.  Its beta version is already there.  We test, improve, finish. <br><br>  Next, I would like to talk about which devices users buy <b>instead of innos D6000</b> .  During communication with pre-order users, we asked those who changed their mind to buy our product.  The table below shows the most common answers - most often, as an alternative to the D6000, they bought Meizu, Xiaomi, Huawei, Lenovo, Highscreen.  That is, smartphones with batteries, whose capacity, albeit only slightly, differs from the typical for the market indicator of 2,500 mAh.  Also, some users took top Samsung and Apple models instead of innos D6000. <br><br>  If you even glance at the table, you can make a simple conclusion: no other smartphone, for all its merits (metal in cases, AMOLED screens, sometimes better cameras), can be a full-fledged alternative to innos D6000 in terms of the main parameter - battery life.  In general, according to the overall reasonableness, for all the chips associated with the provision of this very long battery life.  Above, we already told about one of them - due to the presence of two batteries at once, it is possible to investigate the algorithms of their discharge and choose the best for the safety of batteries.  In addition, the possibility of hot-swap removable removable batteries allows you to purchase as many of these batteries in the company store (990 rubles apiece) and change them in turn.  In this case, the "kit" of Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 and 3 GB of RAM allowed us to get a productive, but at the same time, extremely economical hardware platform.  That is, the engineers managed to achieve the right balance between power and energy consumption.  (By the way, usually in devices on Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 only 2 GB of RAM, so they sometimes slow down.) <br><br>  And due to direct online sales without any markups of innos D6000 retail chains, it costs 15,990 rubles, winning in terms of performance with many devices even for 20-25 thousand.  Actually, if innos were sold in retail, it would cost about the same. <br><br>  Separately, I would like to compare innos D6000 with Highscreen Boost 3 Pro.  The latter comes with 2 batteries - 3,000 and 6,000 mAh.  Together they can not work.  That is, either one or the second.  Some people think that 9,000 mAh is better than 6,000 mAh for the D6000.  But let's count.  Highscreen Boost 3 Pro costs 22 thousand rubles.  innos D6000 - 16 thousand.  Add here one additional battery for 3 520 mAh for 990 rubles - and we get 17 thousand and a total capacity of 9 520 mAh.  Moreover, removable batteries can be changed without turning off the smartphone, and not to work with one or the other, as in the case of Highscreen Boost 3 Pro.  That's it! <br><br>  Actually, the table is a comparison of innos D6000 with smartphones that were bought instead: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cbd/778/c2f/cbd778c2f192e5c81dae4861b8d13d9a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/092/00b/21d/09200b21d268f964067962e88aee7c87.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f79/caf/a23/f79cafa2397b52a5d3c0a540c70c0a17.jpg"><br><br>  Finally - a couple of words about the <b>reasons</b> that buyers called when ordering exactly innos D6000.  The first and primary is the presence of batteries with a total capacity of 6,000 mAh in a relatively compact package.  It turned out that, according to consumers, to make a device with a battery of 4,000 mAh - it is not so difficult, any fool can.  And there are plenty of such models on the market.  But many 4,000 mAh trite little.  Plus, according to our data, many were bribed by the ratio of characteristics, battery power and price.  As one of the buyers put it, ‚ÄúI would have bought it for 20 thousand.  And for 25. There is still no alternative. ‚Äù  And it‚Äôs hard not to agree.  Moreover, innos D6000, in terms of its capabilities and characteristics, is in fact a smartphone from the 20-25 thousand rubles segment.  Because it is sold only in our online store <a href="http://innos.com/ru/">innos.com/ru</a> directly to the consumer, that is, without cheating retail chains that can reach today 40% of the final price.  Sell ‚Äã‚Äãyour D6000 in offline retail - and it would cost 22 with a thousand hooks.  Overtaking at the same time competitors from the camp of Meizu, Xiaomi, Oppo and other similar brands for reasonableness and, as a result, battery life is one and a half times, or even two times.  Well, with a price of 16 thousand rubles, the innos D6000 is Persic at all - there is nothing like this on the market. <br><br>  Of course, if you have questions regarding the innos D6000, our service policy, the new firmware, and generally our access to the Russian market, you can feel free to ask them in the comments.  We will respond as soon as possible. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/372355/">https://habr.com/ru/post/372355/</a></p>
