I started programming in 2003 [ <a href="https://github.com/noisy/MyFirstProgramsFrom2003">1</a> ], although at that time I did not even have the Internet.  I had the book <a href="http://www.ifj.edu.pl/~grebosz/symfonia_c%2B%2B_std_p.html">"Symfonia C ++"</a> and the old Borland 3.11 compiler. </p><br><p> <a href="https://www.livecoding.tv/noisy/videos/QqWkx-writing-an-article-about-lctv-for-steemitcom-2"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/69d/372/8be/69d3728be6a04d2f8e8f60fc703e2131.png"></a> </p><br><p>  Then I had a big problem every time I encountered an error.  As a beginner, I did not know how to debug the code effectively and my huge book could not help me with this.  But, fortunately, I did not give up. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Introduction </h2><br><p>  You must have heard about Twitch.  This strange platform where you can watch how other people play games.  Why do people do it?  Because they want to share experiences and they have a common passion for games.  I am not a player, but I am sure that it is interesting and in some way informative.  It was only a matter of time (and Internet bandwidth) before people realized that streaming could be used for various purposes. </p><br><p>  <i>‚ÄúYou spend too much time at the computer‚Äù</i> @ Mom </p><br><p>  But there are places where people understand why you ‚Äúspend‚Äù your time on writing meaningless code that ‚Äúdoes not do anything useful.‚Äù  In such places, people help each other because they understand how important this is for you.  For me, this place was <a href="https://www.livecoding.tv/">LiveCoding.tv</a> . </p><br><h2>  Debug aloud </h2><br><p>  In the world of programmers, there is a well-known phenomenon, which is that you can find a solution to a complex problem by simply describing it aloud. </p><br><p>  There is another theory where sometimes you don't even need a real interlocutor and you can get by with a rubber duck. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ffa/888/1c7/ffa8881c7b8b4175b338ab9b8ca7d6fc.png"></p><br><p>  It's true, no matter how silly it sounds.  But believe me, real people are smarter and give much better advice.  I am sincerely glad that I can find so many people who can help me. </p><br><h2>  Tips </h2><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f91/8a9/3a6/f918a93a60824e36b511ed78b31a7fcc.png"></p><br><p>  When other people watch you work, they may notice things that you have missed.  The sooner they tell you about the error, the less time you will spend later on debugging. </p><br><p>  I also noticed that when other people are watching my work, I try to write code better, test more and format better.  All because I want my viewers to be aware of what I am doing. </p><br><h2>  Feedback </h2><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b02/3d5/b30/b023d5b300c045a3856d7dbc97e1b8e9.png"></p><br><p>  We are not perfect, our decisions may not always be correct.  You may have a good idea, but brainstorming with other programmers will almost always have a positive effect.  Plus, you can always get a review about a particular thought or product. </p><br><h2>  Archive </h2><br><p>  You will have a complete archive of your product development process.  Do not misunderstand me, this will in no way be able to replace the project documentation. </p><br><p>  However, you will never be able to document your work and thoughts in more detail.  Maybe you will not need it, because you remember everything, but probably in the future you will not have enough time to support all projects.  And also, perhaps, someone wants to continue your project then they will have an explanation for <b>each of your decisions</b> that you made during the development process. </p><br><h2>  Evaluation of efforts and work </h2><br><p>  Evaluation of efforts - did you have a situation in which you did something significant, but no one understood how much time and effort you spent in order to ultimately create a quality product?  Been there, done that.  Is it their fault that you are bad at marketing?  No, it is not so! </p><br><p>  The truth is that for every big project, it is realized through countless hours of hard work, sweat and tears.  When people see hard work, they can really appreciate it, but first you have to give them a chance to see it! </p><br><p>  Job evaluation - there are employers who need guys like you, but sometimes you are in another part of the world.  Theoretically, they can hire you to work remotely, but there are so many problems with remote employees ... </p><br><p>  Your work will become completely transparent if you broadcast the development process and you can very easily prove that you work conscientiously. </p><br><p>  <i>‚ÄúBut wait ... someone can steal my project!‚Äù</i> </p><br><p>  No, do not steal.  Let's face it, the likelihood that you create a product that will blow up the world is small, and if you create it, you must remember that: <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-difference-between-dr_b_4951113">"the idea is 1% success and 99% realization</a> . <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-difference-between-dr_b_4951113">"</a> </p><br><p>  Most people understand that if they want to build something like this, they are more likely to want to help you or simply offer cooperation.  I have been developing my open source project Price Comparison Engine since April 1st.  I recorded over 150 hours of coding, with 7406 views, 116 subscribers and 20 stars on GitHub - this is insane!  Since I started streaming, I noticed that I can do more in less time and in a much better atmosphere.  And it motivates me a lot! </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d87/6f2/46b/d876f246b5c748809cefc65b582dc54f.png"></p><br><p>  Will this also work well for you?  I do not know, there is only one way to check ... </p><br><p>  This article was written in <a href="https://www.livecoding.tv/noisy/videos/QqWkx-writing-an-article-about-lctv-for-steemitcom-2">5 hours broadcast via Livecoding.tv</a> </p><br><p>  Posted by: <a href="https://www.livecoding.tv/noisy/">Noisy</a> , <a href="https://steemit.com/programming/%40noisy/how-to-increase-a-productivity-as-a-software-developer-part-i-livecoding">original</a> </p><br><p>  - The best service to promote Reddit: <a href="http://reddit-marketing.pro/">Reddit-marketing.pro</a> </p></div>
