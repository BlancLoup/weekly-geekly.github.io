Many people dream of working for Google, who decided to connect their lives with IT. <br><br>  Google is a giant company, one of the largest IT corporations.  Employees of such a company are constantly needed (new areas, staff turnover). <br><br>  Everything that is written below is based on personal experience, as well as the experience of those people whom I can trust.

    <h5>  Step 1 - summary. </h5><br>  Google has a special attitude to resume.  Receiving millions of applications per year, the company selects several hundred employees.  That is why an excellent resume is the first step to a dream job. <br>  What to write in the resume is necessary: <br><br><ul><li>  e-mail, telephone for communication </li><li>  all places of study (Universities), additional education </li><li>  Experience <b>*</b> </li><li>  Personal qualities (think of something more original than responsiveness, resistance to stress, sociability) </li><li>  Hobby </li><li>  Reference - people who can give you recommendations </li><li>  Knowledge of languages </li></ul><br>  * Experience in resume for Google (and in general for Western companies) is not only a position, a company, but also those successes and achievements that you have achieved in a position.  If you are a salesman - show the numbers.  If the programmer - how exactly your work improved the work of the company.  The work is recommended to specify the whole, and not only on the profile (if you worked at McDonald's, then even this should be indicated). <br><br>  What <b>you</b> do <b>not need</b> to write in your resume: <br><ul><li>  Date of birth, personal data </li><li>  Do you have a driver's license </li><li>  Family status </li><li>  Other "husks" that only distract the recruiter </li></ul><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Resume must be prepared in English.  It is advisable to draw up a resume, highlight it (but do not write it with a caps or make it too bright).  Photography is not a clear criterion of relevance, but I put it. <br><br>  Resume formats are listed on the site (pdf, doc, html).  The recommended format is .pdf. <br><br><h5>  Step 2 - Job Search </h5><br>  After you have written a great resume for a company, you should look for job openings for which you will apply.  For this, it is worth visiting google.com/jobs. <br>  You can make a choice both at the place of future work (all office vacancies will be shown) and by keywords (for example, if you want to work with a Russian-speaking audience, look for russian). <br>  In each vacancy there are minimum requirements for candidates.  Pay attention to them - if you do not fit at least one item, then it is worth considering.  The more you fit this block, the more likely you are to get an invitation for an interview. <br><br>  At Google, there is also an urgent need for candidates.  For such jobs in the search you need to drive "For immediate consideration".  You will see all the "last minute" job.  You will need to send your resume to e-mail, which is also listed on the page.  Notice what is written in the Important line. <br>  If you specify a subject line incorrectly, the letter will be rejected.  Unfortunately, people work in the company, not robots, so overlays happen that are slow but correcting (I sent a job 6 times for one vacancy, with exactly the specified topic, but it was rejected; after 3 weeks they fixed it). <br><br><h5>  Step 3 - sending a resume </h5><br>  It's all simple - fill out the form on the site, and wait.  Be sure to write a CV, it is really read by the staff, who will then conduct you the first interview. <br><br>  If you are sending a resume to an email address (a burning job), then it is recommended to send it in html. <br><br>  There is a small hint here that can influence the recruiter‚Äôs decision.  Hint is called "sending a resume by a Google employee."  Where to get or meet with such a person?  In social networks (LinkedIn, Professionals).  If you can negotiate and make friends, then with a successful outcome, you will get a job, and the adviser will receive a cash reward. <br><br><h5>  Step 4 - Preparing for the First Interview </h5><br>  If all three previous steps were performed well, then after a while (I had it 1-3 days) you will receive a letter from the recruiter, in which you will be shown the preliminary time of your interview (screening), as well as possible topics for discussion.  Do not be lazy to read the same about the company and its products. <br><br><h5>  Step 5 - Telephone Interview </h5><br>  In a telephone interview will ask simple questions, mainly on basic concepts and motivation.  However, these questions are asked by 90% of recruiters at the first stage of interviews.  Ask for expectations about previous work.  Do not be lazy, on the Internet there are collections of various questions for different vacancies, study them. <br><br><h5>  Step 6 - Technical Interview </h5><br>  If the recruiter considers that you can come to work in the company, they will write you a letter congratulating you on the next stage and set a date. <br>  What they say on those.  The interview is actually a secret, but some people who have not passed it, and have not heard about the NDA, post questions.  For different vacancies, they are different, mostly - on the knowledge of the subject area, but there may be logic and reasoning. <br><br><h5>  Step 7 ‚Äîon-site interview </h5><br>  If step 6 is completed and you are still arranging the company, you will be invited to an interview in the office.  At the same time, you will be paid for arrival at the company's office (either local or to the one where you plan to work).  Interviews are conducted by 4-5 Google employees, who figure out your competencies.  At your request, you can meet with the person who recommended you to work. <br><br><h5>  Step 8 - Getting a Job Offer </h5><br>  If all 5 candidates have responded about you as an excellent employee with a decent level of competence, the company offers you a job.  Job offer details, as well as interview questions are protected by NDA.  But when moving the company offers pleasant compensation packages, for the conditions of which you can bargain. <br><br><h5>  General information that may be helpful <br></h5><ol><li>  All communication and all the news tells you the recruiter.  Do not be afraid to write to him </li><li>  Do not violate the terms of the NDA </li><li>  Be confident in yourself, try not to worry about the interviews. </li><li>  Google‚Äôs language is English, so you should not only write with the help of a translator, but also speak it.  It is very important </li><li>  Decision time for each item is individual, but it will take you on average 1 month from sending a resume to getting a job if successful </li><li>  Google has a very high bounce rate (false-negative).  This is not a reason to get upset, but a reason to work on yourself. </li><li>  For the same job you can apply for a resume six months after the first attempt.  For another job - at any time </li><li>  At Google, all food is free. </li></ol><br><br>  Think, after all, only 8 steps separate you from the dream work of millions.  Perhaps it is your company that is missing!  Why not try? <br><br>  Successes. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/159955/">https://habr.com/ru/post/159955/</a></p>
