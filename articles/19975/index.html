Today, what the public has been waiting for so long!  Two newest firmware for ‚ÄúiPhones‚Äù, which were famous for their ‚Äúunbreakable‚Äù (especially 1.1.3, it wasn‚Äôt even taken by MultiSim and TurboSim) didn‚Äôt follow the hacker‚Äôs perseverance!  Thank for this is the well-known GeoHot (George Hotz), who is only 17 years old! <br><br>  Now, iPhones purchased with firmware 1.1.2 and 1.1.3 can be made to work with any SIM cards without a soldering iron, only after relatively simple manipulations with the software. <br><br>  Instructions for breaking into 1.1.2 and 1.1.3 from iPhones.ru: <a href="http://www.iphones.ru/iNotes/2156/">http://www.iphones.ru/iNotes/2156/</a> (don't be surprised if the site is ‚Äúlying‚Äù - after news of breaking in 1.1.3, crowds were thrown at him people, WordPress can not stand). <br>  Another good step by step instruction: <a href="http://f.macrostov.ru/viewtopic.php%3Ff%3D7%26t%3D27">http://f.macrostov.ru/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=27</a> <br>  The sites said, but I still warn you - be careful, the way of hacking is completely "fresh", it can be buggy.  But in any case, the "iPhone" is almost not killed.  Yes, and several acquaintances have already unsubscribed to me that they were ‚Äúunlocked‚Äù by the method of GeoHot successfully.

      In connection with the aforementioned significant event, the Russian iPhone hackers from <a href="http://ripdev.com/">RipDev</a> decided not to <a href="http://www.iphones.ru/iNotes/2061/">swear</a> that the ‚Äú <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/iphone/34849.html">jailbreak for 1.1.3 is</a> too crooked‚Äù, and released the full Russification package for ‚ÄúiPhones‚Äù with the latest firmware - <a href="http://russianiphone.ru/blog/2008/02/08/russian-project-105/">‚ÄúRussian project‚Äù version 1.0.5</a> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/945/939/985/945939985ba49d6c947293b96ab0cc24.png" width="256" height="256" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  In more detail about release from developers under a cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  * <strong>Added support for firmware 1.1.3</strong> - now the Russian Project is installed on this firmware without any shamanism and dances with tambourines.  The only requirement is the availability of Installer.app version not lower than 3.0.  We consider it our duty to note that we still do not recommend switching to this firmware yet, unless you have special techno-masochistic inclinations.  The current jailbreak options for 1.1.3 have improved significantly since their first release, but still suffer from numerous problems.  Therefore, we spent a lot of time testing the Russian Project under all the jailbreak options we know, and found its work satisfactory, but there are still a few problems that are either related to the jailbreak or with new firmware glitches made by Apple itself.  We warned you, yes?  :) <br>  * <strong>Radically accelerated work component Corr.</strong>  <strong>Formats</strong> - the SMS application now opens much faster, just fixed some errors that could cause departures from SMS. <br>  * <strong>Improved RiPInstall</strong> - now it can reboot the phone itself, as well as the internal logic of the installation of applications has been rewritten (in preparation for the release of Caterpillar). <br>  * <strong>Several changes have been made to the Russian localization</strong> (and, of course, support for 1.1.3 has been added). <br>  * <strong>Many small changes</strong> aimed at improving the performance of the package and the phone as a whole. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/72c/706/9a1/72c7069a173e68ca0e68751b5214e443.png" width="320" height="461" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  The update is available right now in Installer.app.  Here is a detailed guide on how to install the RP on your phone.  The update is free for all registered users.  You can purchase the ‚ÄúRussian project‚Äù for 500 rubles <a href="http://ripdev.com/click/buy/com.ripdev.ruproject/">on the developers page</a> or from the ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù itself during the installation process. <br><br>  <strong>Let me remind you of the main advantages of the ‚ÄúRussian project‚Äù</strong> (without which many ‚Äúdomestic‚Äù iPhone owners cannot live): <br>  - Full user interface translation <br>  - A strip with Russian letters in the contact list, facilitating their search <br>  - Russian keyboard <br>  - Colored logos of main telecom operators <br>  - Beautiful MarkerFelt font for the Notes program <br>  - Reduces phone numbers when dialing them to the usual Russian look format <br>  - Determines the region where they call you <br>  - Corrects minor bugs (such as constantly popping up signage about redirection). <br><br>  In general, I will go to bet, if it is very buggy, I will unsubscribe :).  The Russian keyboard for 1.1.3 (which came out separately before the whole package) is mercilessly buggy so far, often crashes, unfortunately. <br><br>  <strong>UPD</strong> .: RP immediately refused to be put.  It turned out that it was necessary to remove the Mobile Enhanser and the Russian keyboard, which was installed earlier.  After that established. <br><br>  <strong>Established.</strong>  <strong>Asked to restart and hung on the power icon!</strong>  <strong>I made him a reset (holding 2 buttons) and the phone went into mode recovery mode - that is, it does not turn on and asks for recovery via aytyuns!</strong>  <strong>That's how the new ‚ÄúRussian project‚Äù killed my phone!</strong>  <strong>Or rather, even two phones, we have two of them at home.</strong> <strong><br></strong>  Well ... we will recover ... <br><br>  P.S.  who put and works - accomplish your goal.  jailbreak 1.1.3 is still very curve and it could be that. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/19975/">https://habr.com/ru/post/19975/</a></p>
