Welcome under cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Prehistory </h2><br><br>  I am a laptop repairman and programmer.  Often dead laptops come to me that cannot be repaired (for the most part, these are repair costs more than the cost of a laptop) or those that are quick and easy to repair. <br>  From time to time I buy laptops.  So for half a year I have gathered a small collection. <br>  I eventually broke my own Acer Extensa 4230 laptop: both fastenings of the top cover broke.  Small metal fastenings were constructed that did not allow the lid to be closed.

There was no desire or money to buy a new one. <br>  And I decided to build a new laptop. <br><br><h2>  Fact </h2><br><br>  Having examined the ‚Äútrash‚Äù, I selected 3 laptops: my Acer Extensa 4230, MacBook Pro 13` and Toshiba Satellite A110-334. <br>  MacBook has a flooded keyboard.  Water penetrated inside and burned the motherboard.  It would be possible to buy a crashed MacBook on eBay, however, there was no desire and time to wait, so it was lying in the trash.  Toshiba had a broken screen that did not show the bottom half.  My Acer had plastic cut and there were no mounts. <br><br>  The smallest screen was on the MacBook, so I was not going to touch it.  From there were taken: the cooling system in the form of a fan, two dies of 1 GB of RAM, a hard disk of 320 GB. <br><br>  Acer had a 14.1 inch screen and a 2.2 GHz processor. <br><br>  On Toshiba, I replaced the processor with a fan and put the RAM.  Since its diagonal is 15.4 inches, the screen stubbornly left an extra distance.  Screw the display was impossible. <br><br>  Almost all the cables on the displays in laptops are the same, so plugging the display Acer'a, was not a problem.  The problem was to fill the remaining space. <br>  The substrate was taken from the box of the Asus motherboard and laid on the background.  Since it is black, it was not scary.  The main thing was to cut the middle to glue the display. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/644/911/d70/644911d70512b5f752a17f4fe513a59d.jpg" width="800" height="600"><br><br>  For gluing, I used liquid nails, because there was no normal glue at home, and there was no desire to run and buy.  To press the display so that it stuck, I used metal plugs from the system unit, which I had enough.  By bending the edges with pliers, I secured them along the edges.  The top was clamped with plastic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/541/ce0/92c/541ce092c50b43bb59a5b4eb85dbf93d.jpg" width="800" height="600"><br><br>  Having configured Windows 7 Ultimate, I made a performance assessment and was happy with the consequences.  Lose only graphics, especially Aero, but, as you know, it is always the case. <br>  So: <br>  Processor 5.5 <br>  Memory - 6.8 <br>  Aero Graphics - 2.0 <br>  Game Graphics - 3.0 <br>  Disk transfer rate - 5.2 (HDD encrypted with TrueCrypt) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/506/7f5/07b/5067f507b3c2bdd591859c66a1cb8dd2.jpg" width="800" height="600"><br><br>  Since I play only two games and then - on weekends, I tested League of Legends, the graphics of which improved, and GTA San Andreas, with the graphics of which also did not get worse.  Toshiba has an ATI Radeon Xpress 200m 256mb video card. <br><br>  It remains only to fill an empty space.  For this, I want to find a thick, opaque black film.  Where to buy - I do not know yet.  But you have to seal the edges. <br><br>  Pros: <br>  easy enough <br>  fast (according to my requests), <br>  good sound, <br>  Beautiful design, <br>  active cooling system. <br><br>  Minuses: <br>  bulky - still affects the size, <br>  the video would be better <br>  The gaps and the metallic edging of the display are not pleasing to the eye. <br><br>  Bottom line: I haven't completely figured out the function keys, however, I already like its features and sound (which means a lot to me).  The cover, of course, does not please with its Toshiba urban picture, however, it will be possible later to glue over the skin or draw some kind of drawing. <br><br>  Good luck in your creations. <br><br>  <b>UDP</b> : I haven't figured out the video yet.  It turns out you can expand to 512 MB. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/113711/">https://habr.com/ru/post/113711/</a></p>
