  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Predicates of informational hope</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Something new is born inside before the blood of haunted paths.  The trampled and watered cultural soil, from which, as it seems, all the air was blown out, is ready to fulfill what it does best - to put everything in its place on a motherly basis.  Beginning as an intellectual game of singles, taken up by historical necessity, having received the monetary blessing of the World Machine, something on its knee receives power and the right to a sociocultural, philosophical and technical voice, from that moment participating in solving key issues on the epochal scene.  Before us is a qualitatively new Being that has developed in the bosom of the old, woven into its flesh, which, however, joins the ranks of the Resistance in relation to its parent.  Taken away from all sides by those who, by their genetic purpose, see it as a means, the subject of our intention is fighting for the recognition of oneself as a goal, shaping our own sociocultural dignity.  We can only assume, more often - to dream, about what impact the new force will have on the picture of the future.  Now we are securing the word for him - a dream that has already become a reality through some of its manifestations. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Utopian thinkers, playfully theorizing, wrote wonderful pictures of the future: the third wave, the post-industrial society, and finally, the information society.  Much of what was recorded broke on the strong walls of the world's towers of Babel.  Utopia is an out-of-the-figurative invention, but we do not exhaust it only with this: the ideas of utopians do not tolerate total collapse - the new force does expose a number of traditional spiritual models of humanity in the 20th century to violent change. <br><br>  With intrinsic instrumental neutrality in itself, when meeting with Man in a particular historical arena, informatization brings advantages, just as it brings problems ‚Äî challenges ‚Äî to modernity.  Accepted and meticulously developed, these latter are out of current review.  Now we are interested in the first.  Performing one of its functions - to be a tool and unfold in relation to the external, the forces of informatization evolutionarily develop their internal component, with values ‚Äã‚Äãinherent only in it, ideology, mythology, archetypes, magic, in general, culture.  Here we find its intrinsic value.  Here we find the soil loose.  And here the slave canvas of the horizon of an illusive free game becomes thinner.  The information world is the result of almost artel production, whose members at the dawn of their journey, against the background of bright distancing from the outside, seizing it into the redundancy contour, inside their repressed circle, italics formed an extremely high density of foreign matter, deserving the image of urban madmen, becoming mocking and detached ( above) subculture. <br><br>  The sphere of informatization production is naturally subjected to the influence of external forces beyond its control ‚Äî some kind of almost uncontrollable machinery of production efficiency.  However, the internal structure, being uniquely folded, rooted in marginality, and, moreover, is by no means anarchic, is able to successfully find the strength to resist the fan, systemic subordination.  With her characteristic youthfulness, she conducts her affairs in the arena of large, almost planetary and, of course, historical decisions.  The traditional industrial culture of New Time, having groped for its unity, the center of its own, its own unique way, has grown and spread over several centuries, occupying more space, absorbing more land, using more peripheral resources of particular interest to it.  This culture is essentially a quantitative deployment.  Therefore, we call it quantitative culture.  The millstones of such a machine are twisted tightly, rotate quickly, and for a long time, by inertia, they will grind their fuel, including the person himself, turning everything into dust ‚Äî technical waste.  But our generation attracts a different production, a different person, a different culture ‚Äî a quality culture in which expansion is replaced by deepening, ‚Äúspiritualization.‚Äù  Developing the same soil, on the ground, where after the victorious march of past eras remained scorched earth, it builds its new Building, without blind hopes of domination over nature, but rather - more thoughtful (informatization) creating "live" connections.

      The tasks of the new culture are extremely complex, because it works with the legacy of past epochs - with the sociocultural crisis of the 20th century, generated in the depths of positivist (as some would later conclude - naively) programmed New Age, with attendant alienations: from the results of their work, from the working group, from social connections and many others.  Intellectual and spiritual charge is extremely closely related to the abundance of resources, the key of which is time: cultural layers of humanity take root here, both material and spiritual, which could develop only at those moments when questions of survival (both biological and sociocultural; physiological and mental) set aside.  Progress itself unfolds in an area free from elementary vital necessity. <br><br>  Not so long ago, contrasting classes that existed ‚Äî high carriers of spiritual energy ‚Äî constructively set the spiritual rhythm, spreading its vibrations into the external environment.  They were characterized by a certain idleness and "existential boredom", which, incidentally, is characteristic of the person of the XXI century.  The question is how to fight / deal with the inevitably pulsating sublimation dynamics.  The presence of superfluous heterogeneous resources has caused an excess in the biological sense of the word.  It, as a superstructure, is actually Human.  The tragedy is that the insignia served as the beginning of the process of the abolition of the abyss, which has continued abruptly in recent centuries.  And the person is forced to pay for it: now the abyss is not only in front of him, it is also inside him. <br><br>  The internal culture of the production processes of the information age is limited and feasible, but confidently enters into the struggle with the established models of the past.  The production specificity, by virtue of its natural youth, returns the concept of redundancy to the pragmatic and semantic use of a person, offering in practice (nostalgically) to get acquainted with his creative character.  There is an increase in the value of social relations within production processes.  The rusted mechanism of the centripetal clarification of the general is launched: the goals and objectives are really rare guests of the present (1).  The force of coercion to ‚Äúturn away to the wall‚Äù and ‚Äúbump into a point‚Äù weakens.  It becomes permissible to look around - time appears for this.  There is a "craftization" of production culture, which enters into the struggle with the awareness of the place occupied by the work processes, which, according to their temporal characteristics, occupy for the most part the forming role in the life-psychic schedule - the "home fortress" remains outside the current topos. <br><br>  (1) Some of us were even lucky enough to see something similar to the Ideal. <br><br>  In the 19th and 20th centuries, an understanding of home and work enters a highly conflict relationship - these are forces on opposite sides of the barricades, often reaching violent acts.  Through the sociocultural tricks available to him, a person cleans home space from any signs of the work process, so that nothing reminds of that particular, often acutely negative color of labor of the era of the formation and development of capitalism.  The time of home-work has passed, between the two fundamental social institutions - the family and the profession - a watershed, both territorial and psychological, is being formed. <br><br>  But human psychology is changing.  They - the changes - relate not only to the attitude to work, but also to what stands on the opposite scales of the scales, in painful attempts, and to confess - rarely, when successful, trying to balance a shaky person.  Changes relate to leisure.  A ritually bored person in the workplace (‚Äúa person who is bored‚Äù, ‚Äúan animal that is bored‚Äù), ‚Äúasubject‚Äù, with cosmically alienated necessity, driven here against his will, detached and confused, accumulates everyday boredom, waiting for ‚Äúall this will end ".  The closing circle, which keeps a person by stealing his redundancy - fuel development, is programmed so as not to seem a deceiver: a terrible week ends, the end of the penal servitude is near and the time of erect walking, the lungs fill with fresh air, and everything seems to be no longer so meaningless - an inner one appears Hope is ‚Äútoo human‚Äù not to be constituted in the flesh of what is necessary.  This charge is a charge of necessity, without being able to be distributed evenly, densely and forcibly concentrated in time, turning into a clot of motivation and will.  So, will it be unexpected that the situation is potentiated to places that go out of human control, going to extremes, objectified in radical, marginal forms of narcotic, alcoholic, fanatical, role intoxication?  We question the meaning, and, not finding it, we quickly replace it with surrogates, to the brim with our stuff-environment. <br><br>  Informatization production culture is the first force on the world stage over the past few centuries that challenges the deeply rooted modern labor culture.  Conducting internal filtering on youth, both mind and spirit, she is trying as much as she can to eliminate the influence of the embraces of the past - previous eras, as strong as jealous, doubtful, ossified, whispering manifestos about riches, heavy load on a person‚Äôs shoulders.  Youth is the cornerstone of information production, a knot that weaves a lot of what is mentally significant.  We can not avoid the frequent use of the word. <br><br>  A young intellect, not subject to the past, is not a debtor and obliged, as they try to present it.  A clever old man pulls his hands for a friendly hug filled with a hymn of erudition, but we know what stands behind it.  Hands off!  We will not be your next maid.  Young intellect young in spirit.  He finds himself among alike, among those who go near.  He values ‚Äã‚Äãconnections with people who are walking.  Communication is a value, if you have something to talk about.  Youth finds something to talk about.  Youth wants to speak. <br><br>  The young heart of informatization production fills with the life that for many years dried up the scorching sun of the positive feeling of Scientist knowledge, which requires continuous correspondence to the internal logic of productivity ‚Äî internal social connections.  Silence, isolation, detachment, estrangement are feasibly removed within the collectives.  The taste of human intercourse, living communication, which acquire their legal right to be at the top, albeit surrounded by surrogates, is returning.  Socialization smoothes the processes of a forced abandonment of a person into, as it were, alien, nonintimate, non-personalized, poorly controlled, and therefore frightening and fraught with many dangers territory.  The gap is thinning, the balance is groped, the extremes recede into darkness.  Work and home, work and leisure - are no longer located far from the conflict, opposite to each other, and the psychic energy is not cornered, acquiring the ability to resonate constructively. <br><br>  Art - our eternal barometer of sociocultural energy - offers us its argument - architectural and associated with it - environmental style with the euphonic name, as if deliberately extracted from the archetypical depths in order to build bridges between the two substances - "high-tech", challenging a long tradition delimitation of home and work spaces.  This phenomenon is not alien to the inner spirit of informatization production.  The reason is precisely what was said above: the reduction of the psychological chasm between the two institutions.  Work incorporates what was the prerogative of home comfort, the house finds effective use of tools for managing work processes (2).  Two artificially, but historically necessary divorced areas have something to learn from each other.  For the information age, as we see such interaction, interpenetration is a characteristic beginning. <br><br>  (2) We know that this trend should be considered multilaterally.  But such an analysis is not the task of this work.  Here, the argument is used to partially prove what is repeatedly underlined. <br><br>  The stated ‚Äúquality‚Äù of the informatization culture is realized in one more, not exclusive, but still peculiar project, already without reservations, radically completely overcoming the foreignness of the home and work spheres to each other - work in the home space.  Obediently obeying the requirements of production manifestos, a person no longer has to stand at the machine, like three centuries ago, or be present in the office, like a century ago.  Deep production and technical changes have led to the fact that the main object is subject to expedient activity along completely different energy highways, the entrance to which is no longer a cumbersome mechanical system, but a more compact other system - electronic, computer - freely fit in home space.  Characteristic of the handicraft industry of the past, the model described again acquires relevance on a qualitatively new, modern foundation, marking changes in human consciousness. <br><br>  The historical sociocultural background in which the force described by us unfolds is characterized by a crisis, with pronounced distrust in relation to the logic of knurled reductions: systematic, rational and, according to the current tradition, dehumanistic tricks are not always suitable for its description.  The crisis requires a different description, difficult to express in words, since it is impossible to clearly express a person ‚Äî that dynamic soil that serves as an identity to the word ‚Äúeverything‚Äù.  We will not repeat the gross mistakes of the past, and we will not deny ourselves in an attempt to give some explanation to the reader.  Our epoch is an era to the death of stuck masks, chimera-values, informational fermentation, revived controlled sporadic models and the eternal struggle for life.  This is the epoch in which, in rare moments of weakening of the machine's grip, we plunge into dreams of sun rays, courageously burning through hundred-year growths, formed from lash strikes, to the vital clean flesh of humanity.  The feeling of total corruption is one of the key dominants of modern intellectuals, who, by all adolescent and sometimes marginal rituals, entirely contradicted by structures, renounce such a label. <br><br>  Everything is for sale, everything is sold, also with big Sunday discounts.  The long-awaited, promised Sunset is about to come.  Socio-cultural mechanisms - beauty, art, creativity, personality - once called upon to participate in the Resistance, are now on the other side, inside glass counters, in which reflection is hidden, but the face of an intelligent old man is clearly visible.  The force on which enormous hopes were pinned for several centuries, which the strongest minds of mankind, which was designed to build and unite, had learned from concealment, became a selling lot available to a limited number of buyers.  We are talking about the mind. <br><br>  Mind, as the key force for solving both ontological, epistemological, and ethical-aesthetic problems, has not historically justified all the expectations placed on it, and in the end it turned out to be in timid subordination to the forces that had recently been friendly level with it.  It took a long investigation (3) to uncover the fundamental limits of the mind - the benefit of which he himself is the key assistants in this matter.  The result was the deepest doubt in the power of rational knowledge, sometimes reaching fanatical denial and militant uprising.  But man is a synonym for effort, effort, and hope.  And now, as has happened more than once, we are witnessing yet another ‚Äúhigh-tech‚Äù attempt to restore the creative status of mind on the basis of a new information age, which, according to our consideration, is sufficiently nutritious for intellectual shoots.  At the very least, it should be pointed out that informatization production is an intellectual production that warmly accepts rationality into its narrative (4).  Our hope is that the intellectual character of getting used to life and its experiences will not be alien to the man himself of this production.  The bottom line is the solid presence of prerequisites.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At that time, as throughout the history of mankind, various existential answers, solutions, systems and models, now not deleted from the pages of the human book, immanently contained in the future, are now thrown on the multidimensional scales. one more addition, one more counterbalance in the most complicated relationship system is offered Nothing will press the results (and someone will say - success) of the XX century, no one will "justify" and reverse the XVII century, no one will return in the X century. However, we are waiting for the rebirth of something that people already know. And, as it seems to us, the acquaintance is sad. We look forward to the hope that, being a supplement, a clarification, an explanation - fresh air - things will turn out differently. Our hope is that the mind, comfortably placed in the bosom of the internal information sphere,with a friendly grip will seize a man creeping into the extreme - into endless swamps of subconscious, irrational silhouettes.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">(3) It is noteworthy that the moment of the beginning of the investigation approximately coincides with the moment of the appearance of the phenomenon of science-centrism itself. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">(4) A kind of sign, and in combination - a catalyst - this process is the flowering of so-called popular science, in which the secrets of highbrow elite-scientific constructions are set out, albeit in an extremely simplified, but consistent with the spirit of the time form, which, however, does not interfere some people have come to the level of everyday knowledge in applying this knowledge.</font></font><br><br>  *** <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In our narrative experiments, we allot an important place to idealization, but in rare moments of apodictic despair, we are able and ready for the opposite ‚Äî to ‚Äúrealize‚Äù through traditional binary illusion. Having a clear idea that we live in an era characterized by a multilateral crisis, including a crisis of human dignity, it should be recognized that, being existentially inalienable, it is human dignity cannot remain in an empty state, that is, it is rapidly seeking self-fulfillment from any available artificial and natural cultural sources, in difficult times of crisis fermentation, overshadowing the qualitative issues, replacing them with quantitative ones. Dissolution, deconcentration of spiritual landmarks, more recently focused on social differentiation, transcendental,extraterrestrial forces, violation of the setting and adjustment of self-identification, which is once happening with the help of higher (ideal) samples - all this pushes a person to search for a new source of dignity. It is not surprising that it occupies an empty place, if you remember which economic system characterizes today. Our time is a time of money worth. He is more worthy, who is richer in cash. We, pushed towards realization through monetary identification, conclude: the informatization production feels comfortable in the model offered by the spirit of the time, concentrating in its luggage the high density of money material. The man of information production, at least, does not meet on his way to his own dignity insurmountable, tightly closed,office (in the spirit of Kafka) doors. Moreover, the entrance here is an event to which (at this stage) the exclusivity of a large social inheritance and great acquaintances is alien. We add that the spirit of informatization production is not characterized by the loss of connection with the earth, generated by dizzying, random (in the classical mental model) results that seem to be richly littered with modern socio-cultural soil. In this sense, it is the result of expedient activity in its classical sense - even if it is hidden, but here the Ideal is deployed.random (in the classical mental model) results that seem to be richly littered with modern socio-cultural soil.

In this sense, it is the result of expedient activity in its classical sense - even if it is hidden, but here the Ideal is deployed.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúQuality‚Äù is the most important characteristic of informatization production, which largely loosens the depth, to a lesser extent - the exciting area - while altering the classical German formula, undoubtedly, is not only a goal, but also a means. As a proposition, unfolding to the outside is the same vector to the phenomenological completeness. Industries that take on the role of users of the results of information production, are given the opportunity to get in touch with the inner spirit of global changes brought about by the fresh, electrified air of the enchanting information age. Like a skilled jeweler, an IT person manages previously rough, hastily captured lands, depriving them of their characteristic industrial, and at the same time cultural, roughness. The natural brilliance of shapes inherited by the logic of expansionit remains to be seen, but it is already clear that we are standing in front of a huge iceberg, the top of which does not contain answers to all our concerns and does not correspond to the challenge ‚Äî a man-made engineering project ‚Äî that throws time on the poor head of humanity.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now, entering the depths of the 21st century, we note the presence of a multitude of people freed from the industrial and production dictatorship of the past, whose spiritual path originates in the discursive field of informatization production, an area that seems to us to be a separate, folklore image and rules. You can read about how bad it is in a different place - today people have learned well to dig the ground in the backyard in search of the dead. We say: such people were less affected by the damage to the inhuman, medium-oriented dances of large stone statues. In particular, this is reflected in the breakdown of the hereditary relationship (advance) with the models of past epochs, the heart of which were directivity, fear and responsibility, dissolved in the team. Now we see wellthat tramps everywhere go in expensive costumes, lost ghosts, phantoms without a home, or rather, with a house that has remained in the past, no longer having an existential design, rejecting the spirit of youth as such. With all the determinism of the power that they inherited, they are trying to reach the living, quivering heart. But the repertoire has changed, a new story is being written.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The man of the epoch of crisis highlights his existence, asserts his own ‚ÄúI‚Äù, being inscribed in the conditions of the incessant battle, the subject of which is himself. He is forced to constantly fight for himself, for his self, his intrinsic value, for his irreducibility with the depersonalist forces, much superior to him - advertising, bureaucratic, television, political and other types of violence, generated by a motley bouquet of hidden and at the same time overt human dreamland, which account to become a sign of bad taste. Armed with an impressive arsenal of means, these militant forces aggressively and scientifically select a person from themselves, plunder his spirit, use it as a means for their uncomplicated goals, building up their psychological colonies within him. We know,that ‚Äúinformation shots‚Äù always hit the head, but they are not able to touch our heart. Our only hope is that a new person, developing in the bosom of information production, a new spiritual and magical power, picked up by the fresh wind of meta-changes, blessed by the World Spirit thirsting for progress, will not change itself in the end, will retain its life-giving roots and will not be corrupted under exceptionally heavy reductionist test. Inherent detachment, island nature, as we believe, will allow to break the bonds of discursive stereotypes developed by the Machine on a thorough scientific basis. At the same time, we are witnessing how, over the past decades, the initial socio-cultural drop-out movement, which allowed the first couples to keep the key avant-garde cultural reserve from, includingdissolved in the environment of a typed person, significantly decreased: the acute processes of misunderstanding of the new force, often characteristic of the immature human consciousness, were replaced by processes of effective interaction and mutual handshakes. We believe that, like a man once upon a time, taking the first steps towards narrowing the circle of survival, scooping up water not with his hands, but typing it into a sea shell, while receiving space outside this circle, where the excessive activity of drawings on the walls began to emerge caves and the manufacture of female figurines, and even now the redundancy, extracted from the ground-trodden ground by the force of qualitative changes, will allow us to put aside a fight, as we are told, with an outcome predetermined by nature, for a short time,turn away from surrogate-produced terrestrial surfaces and avant-garde look forward, to the horizon of a unique, unprecedented, unrecordable human life.</font></font></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/452060/">https://habr.com/ru/post/452060/</a></p>
