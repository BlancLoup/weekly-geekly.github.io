  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why the poor cannot be healthy</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs better to be poor but healthy than rich but sick‚Äù are the first words that come to mind of many of my patients, and these words have ceased to be relevant since 1946, when the statute of the World Health Organization was adopted. <br><br>  Since 1946, the poor man has ceased to be considered healthy.  Poverty has become just as bad as the lack of a part of the body or the presence of disability due to a chronic disease. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gp/x5/ni/gpx5ninedehvdatouazmhyph3dm.jpeg"><br>  There was a qualitative leap from understanding health, like the absence of diseases and injuries, to health, as a result of complete physical, mental and social <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2597%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D1%258C%25D0%25B5">well-being</a> .  Quality of life has become another measure of health.  To console myself with the fact that I do not get sick, because I do not really need wealth, it does not work anymore. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Medicine is a very conservative area of ‚Äã‚Äãactivity, and paradigm changes occur slowly and gradually.  The concept of the biomedical model of medicine, which dominates until the end of the Second World War, crystallizes into the <a href="http://www.strana-oz.ru/2006/2/biopsihosocialnaya-model-25-let-spustya">biopsychosocial</a> model of medicine only at the beginning of the third millennium. <br><br>  If the absence of illness or injury is enough for a biomedical model to consider a patient healthy, then for a biopsychosocial model of medicine, factors of quality of life (the lifestyle of both healthy and sick people) are also important.

      ‚ÄúHealthy lifestyle‚Äù, healthy lifestyles - the words that are found everywhere and, as usual, are understood in context: I went to the gym - ate salads and fruits.  About sleep and ecology recall less.  About the quality of workers, friendships and family relationships even less.  High-quality sex as a factor in healthy lifestyles emerges from memory sometimes.  But money as a factor in health is taboo. <br><br>  At the same time, physical, mental and social well-being depends on monetary prosperity.  The amount of money earned reflects poorly prosperity - everyone needs their own level of cash flow in order to live in prosperity.  Prosperity is a relative condition. <br><br>  Here is a sample list of questions you should ask yourself in order to understand whether you live in abundance: <br><br><ul><li>  What is the balance of expenses and incomes with you (is accumulation, live in debt or at zero)? </li><li>  Is there a financial ‚Äúsafety cushion‚Äù (cash accumulation allowing two months to live on them in normal mode of consumption)? </li><li>  Do you save on the quality of food, can you fully eat 2-3 times a day? </li><li>  Do you have a daily change of linen, a full set of clothes and shoes for the weather? </li><li>  Do you have a separate living space? </li><li>  How much free time do you have, besides work and driving from / to work? </li><li>  Do you have time to sleep? </li><li>  Can you afford to buy ‚Äúunnecessary‚Äù things? </li><li>  Do you have time and money to recover from work and leisure? </li><li>  How safe and confident do you feel financially in relationships (with family and friends, at work)? <br></li><li>  How many sources of income do you have? </li><li>  How many hundreds of items on the wish list do you have? </li></ul><br>  Poverty is quickly identified by a list of these questions.  Even well-earned people find in the list those awkward questions that put the question: ‚ÄúIf I am so successful, then why is it bad here and here?‚Äù. <br><br>  As soon as there is an understanding that prosperity involves not only the amount of money, but also the knowledge and skills to properly dispose of them, the biopsychosocial model of medicine comes on the scene.  The key role in this model is to learn how to find optimal behavioral patterns for human health, work independently on the quality of one‚Äôs life, and change the public worldview to improve public and personal health. <br><br>  An example of the introduction of new principles of understanding health can be the UN program for the elimination of poverty and poverty, the integration of people with disabilities into society, gender equality, decent work and sustainable growth, the maintenance of the environment ... <br><br>  National programs are good, but how to be specific to me?  This question is impossible to give a definite answer.  There are plenty of individual factors that only you and financial literacy programs can take into account to help you develop your own strategy for achieving wealth. <br><br>  UPD.  Not everyone was able to note references in the text to the official definition of the concept of "health" from the <a href="https://www.who.int/ru/about/who-we-are/constitution">WHO charter</a> : "Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, and not just the absence of diseases and physical defects." <br><br>  And a review article on the formation of a <a href="http://www.strana-oz.ru/2006/2/biopsihosocialnaya-model-25-let-spustya">biopsychosocial approach to medicine</a> . <br><br>  Health is more than just the absence of disease or injury, and one of the components of health is a state of wealth.  The topic is painful for many, I will be glad if the article will help in the awareness of the health problems of Habr's readers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/443450/">https://habr.com/ru/post/443450/</a></p>
