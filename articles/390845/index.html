Now bb-mobile Topol 'LTE has appeared on the market, which has got support for high-speed Internet, got a slot for another SIM-card and is running Android 5.1 Lollipop.  The updated gadget in its characteristics has become more powerful, more reliable and more modern.  The cost of the device is 14,990 rubles. It is interesting to see how the new Topol, named after the rocket complex, will manifest itself in games and other disciplines of the everyday user "sport": watching TV shows for survival, reading avidly and surfing the web. connection with reality.  A gaming eight-inch tablet with a good display and impressive cameras will be the hero of this review. <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/bb-mobile/blog/271650/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/148/7bd/e0f/1487bde0f23d63c8a29ee67424845866.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Contents of delivery </h2><br>  bb-mobile Topol 'LTE stands out not only for its durable metal body and technical characteristics, but also for its packaging design.  The complete box looks bright, attracts attention, is replete with many inscriptions and memorable details.  The package bundle turned out to be quite wide: here you can find an OTG cable, a USB cable, a wired stereo headset, and a device for recharging the device.  There is also a stylus and a cloth to keep the screen and case clean.  The permanent accessory closes the parade of accessories: instruction and warranty card. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e48/cec/c97/e48cecc973c36ff1d1aed2727395ca4a.jpg">

They have a common feature: in both models, the body is all-metal.  This has a good effect on the level of protection of the device from external damage, such as small bumps and scratches, and on cooling.  Metal copes well with the heating of the processor, dissipating the heat it emits.  As a result, playing on such a tablet is much more pleasant than on ‚Äúcompanions‚Äù in plastic cases, which begin to heat up significantly after passing through several game levels.  In the hand, the bb-mobile Topol 'LTE case feels like something pleasant, solid and reliable.  There are two color solutions for this model: a completely black case and a white front panel with a silver back. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/afb/ddb/f37/afbddbf37709e1b102ad99dbff3de702.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/113/31f/d8b/11331fd8bc6f0ce6fa443ac74def11cb.jpg"><br><br>  The device dimensions are 212 x 126 x 9.4 mm.  As you can see, the gadget came out not too thick - and this despite the "protective" back panel.  In this case, the hero of this material weighs a little more than the first bb-mobile Topol '. <br><br>  The front side is occupied by the screen, proximity sensor, earpiece and front 5-megapixel camera. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1ed/b53/f43/1edb53f43d7c625a4a608777ef61c42c.jpg"><br><br>  The headset input is on the top edge, next to it is a microUSB port. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/955/602/55b/95560255b3e62b6364f9c2a63342b6f3.jpg"><br><br>  The right side is reserved for the device on / off buttons and volume control swing.  Both per millimeter protrude above the end of the case, the neighborhood of the keys does not interfere without problems and to the touch to determine where and which of them is located. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/aeb/d58/a3d/aebd58a3dc80d29ea473f7fc8ec8dee6.jpg"><br><br>  The back of the device is occupied by the rear 8-megapixel camera and multimedia speaker grilles, slightly creaking at high volume, but quite loud. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b6c/af5/35a/b6caf535ac1fca55b6b91f2fdeebb305.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/64b/49c/337/64b49c337ba749d3c859d683ef338684.jpg"><br><br>  The plastic cover protects the slot for the slots of two SIM-cards of miniSIM + microSIM and MicroSD-cards with capacities up to 32 GB.  And here there is a difference from the first "Topol", in which the support of only one SIM card was implemented. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b11/0cd/71f/b110cd71fd413a010fc99f8127e86139.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a0d/716/58c/a0d71658cbdd6b7a0b7ffb0e6d405fa9.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Screen </h2><br>  As mentioned above, the gadget from the box gets to the user with a protective film already glued to the screen.  It is of high quality and almost not felt when pressed, removed easily, but the desire to disrupt it does not immediately arise. <br><br>  IPS-display with a diagonal of 8 inches has a resolution of 1280 x 800 pixels.  Playing on a tablet with such a screen is a pleasure: the good clarity of the picture, pixelation is almost not noticeable.  The widest viewing angles and vivid, vivid color reproduction - in general, there is something to praise the screen.  Illumination pleases with uniformity: no overexposure in the corners.  Working with bb-mobile Topol 'LTE in the direct rays of the sun is quite possible: the texts remain readable, except that the picture fades a bit.  At high tilt angles, the brightness level drops slightly, but there are no more sinners behind the display.  Touch multitouch supports up to five simultaneous touches.  All clicks are worked out normally, without delay. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bd6/05e/ff4/bd605eff4ed1cd080c70e07d364eab14.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1e2/e73/bbb/1e2e73bbba5f30c063ce78e9361bfe40.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/35e/6cc/d66/35e6ccd668c441e550094cc9c0659899.jpg"><br><br>  To adjust the color is a set of tools from the manufacturer of the chipset, namely the company MediaTek.  It is called MiraVision. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b76/285/7e2/b762857e2903405bc1f6d44821073ca7.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/58b/e47/b78/58be47b78c4ecb4c527a97be39bd38a6.png"><br><br>  If you hold the tablet in a vertical orientation, the thickness of the side frames is about six millimeters, and the top and bottom - about two centimeters.  In landscape orientation, it is convenient to grasp the thickened frames without touching the screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fcd/28f/11a/fcd28f11a4a63ee431b0448a96fbb52e.jpg"><br><br>  In general, bb-mobile Topol 'LTE gives the impression of a reliable fighter.  Here you have a solid solid case, which is pleasant to hold in your hands, and a screen, which does not tire of long work. <br><br><h2>  operating system </h2><br>  bb-mobile Topol 'LTE runs Android 5.1 Lollipop with a Material Design interface.  A lot of texts have already been written about him, therefore it is hardly worth repeating.  Supported updates by air.  The system runs smoothly and without fail. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d53/cec/67e/d53cec67e2e5a7b09227d81ca73f97cd.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/aef/0e7/a3f/aef0e7a3fde4f1a0440b44f5051ce5df.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/026/f93/658/026f9365833bad1f432fa147584fce2d.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24d/ca7/db0/24dca7db0b65a8fb12f5589caa56f108.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/263/f23/7d9/263f237d93725bdf85cdf19e907df5bd.png"><br><br><h2>  Performance </h2><br>  It's time to find out how bb-mobile Topol 'LTE is managed with games.  So, the system operates on the new 8-core chipset for tablets MediaTek MT8783.  Frequency - up to 1.3 GHz.  Used graphics accelerator Mali-T720MP3.  In the arsenal of the device 2 GB of RAM.  The file storage capacity is 16 GB.  With such characteristics on display with a resolution of 1280 x 800 dots, the absolute majority of gaming applications from the Play Market run smoothly.  And not ‚Äúquietly, barely and slightly moaning‚Äù goes, but on the graphics settings set to maximum.  Streaming video, too, does not sin "jumps" frames. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/985/b38/069/985b380696fbdf775cfd5c16dad26f35.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ca4/71c/265/ca471c265db712a19092b32ff5d04ac0.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f06/713/c96/f06713c96ecac210db529c8c4a35a2dc.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/33e/0d2/2a1/33e0d22a1b4b005ee4b5b6e3b389251e.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24d/aaf/d1f/24daafd1ffc76f67a264f384f2d7c836.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/65c/d01/e74/65cd01e7465a3122db018471e097a40d.png"><br><br>  AnTuTu synthetic tests give out 37,000 ‚Äúparrots‚Äù: a very good result for a mobile device.  In general, the positioning of bb-mobile Topol 'LTE as a gaming tablet is fully justified. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0b1/c4a/8f2/0b1c4a8f29688a31d7846288fda97b74.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/30c/2b6/210/30c2b62105db415c4ab457e7114c67f2.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/07d/480/f30/07d480f30c94a2914062dbe04e272e97.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/447/cc7/3df/447cc73df769e39d560d83b0dd5b3aa6.png"><br><br><h2>  Camera </h2><br>  Self-lovers and anyone who does not turn off the webcam during a video call, there is a reason to shout "Hurray!": The front camera with a resolution of 5 megapixels gives you the opportunity to present themselves to the world more often.  In comparison with competing models (not only Russian, but also foreign), whose front cameras often have a resolution of 2 megapixels, or even 0.3, bb-mobile Topol 'LTE takes a leading position.  It remains only to attend to good lighting. <br><br>  As for the rear camera, its resolution is 8 megapixels, and there is autofocus too.  The pictures come out of high-quality, much clearer than those of most middle-class tablets.  Moreover, bb-mobile Topol 'LTE is not positioned at all as a photo artist's tool.  Even small objects do not lose their shape in the frame.  In the fog and twilight, the objects in the photo are still distinguishable, the spectrum of transmission of shades is very good.  In addition, you can use the flash.  And, of course, especially pleased with the clarity of photos of the text.  And abstracts, and pages printed on a printer with a drying cartridge, are readable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6dd/ce0/29c/6ddce029c05268ed85769113271b89ff.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/27c/445/53a/27c44553a1cb164955b3595bd3323827.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/82f/34e/7f9/82f34e7f978ccd0d715883a920bacbd2.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/198/673/d23/198673d23aaafe2761014a621ab2e24e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/462/d09/94b/462d0994bb9a7f30de27d13f17a6a038.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/329/4e8/b5b/3294e8b5be9fd8ebc4fb6759a02457b5.jpg"><br><br>  The camera interface is typical for devices on MediaTek chipsets: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f16/e3a/913/f16e3a9139541d6f4ea98ecc9aaab95e.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fb0/09a/dc3/fb009adc3499228aaaa2f08d1913436e.png"><br><br><h2>  Communication and wireless modules </h2><br>  Support for two SIM-cards and voice communication allows the tablet to replace the smartphone.  Even if this option is not considered on an ongoing basis, it is convenient to travel outside the city without stuffing your backpack to capacity with all sorts of gadgets and chargers for them.  Thanks to the support of voice calls, you can talk without a headset.  Of course, if the diagonal of 8 inches and the weight of the device, amounting to 326 grams, will not interfere with communication.  If the long-lasting telephone conversations leaks hand, you can use a wired stereo headset.  Which, by the way, is of quite good quality as opposed to plastic "noise makers", which manufacturers often put in a set "so that everyone can."  Of course, there is a consistently well-working Bluetooth with Wi-Fi.  And also the ability to use bb-mobile Topol 'LTE as a GPS-navigator.  On a large, in comparison with a typical car navigator, the screen is convenient to navigate the terrain.  Signatures of geographical objects are placed on the screen, not merging and not overlapping each other. <br><br><h2>  Autonomous work </h2><br>  The battery with a capacity of 4,000 mAh does not ask for autonomy in the record book, but at the same time, you will not reproach it for extremely short periods of time either.  In average user mode, when there is time to watch a new 45-minute episode or two episodes of 25 minutes each, take several incoming calls, spend about an hour surfing the Internet and play a little, bb-mobile Topol 'LTE does without an outlet for about a day.  If you use the system's power more intensively, do not turn off the wireless modules and devote the maximum time to the games, the battery will be exhausted after four and a half hours.  In general, it is quite suitable gadget that allows you to get to work and have fun on the road, and during the day will not be appealing to squeak, hinting that it would be nice to "eat". <br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  It is safe to say that bb-mobile Topol 'has been successfully upgraded and rethought.  The new 8-inch bb-mobile Topol 'LTE is a great option for a gadget suitable for surfing the web, GPS navigation and a variety of current games that certainly won't hang and slow down here.  Rather powerful platform based on the eight-core processor for tablets MediaTek MT8783 gives good performance and speed.  This is confirmed by about 37,000 points scored in the synthetic texts of AnTuTu.  The device adds strength to the all-metal case, assembled, as they say, conscientiously.  The operating system Android 5.1 Lollipop is a good, not buggy "OS", which is easy to manage.  It is worth bb-mobile Topol 'LTE 14,990 rubles, this is quite a reasonable price.  Not so prohibitively cheap, but for this money, in addition to the advantages listed above, the buyer gets a good set of accessories, a high-quality eight-inch display on the IPS-matrix, as well as cool cameras that are not inferior in quality to the optics in modern middle-class smartphones. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/390845/">https://habr.com/ru/post/390845/</a></p>
