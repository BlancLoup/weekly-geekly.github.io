  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Future culture</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The horizons of the future are in no hurry to open so quickly.  And especially difficult was the understanding of the image of culture.  ‚ÄúThat's what, but everyone can say anything about culture,‚Äù I thought, and just as quickly this illusion melted in my eyes when I tried to grasp the experience of the past.  The more I tried to understand the past, the worse my position became - the focus was completely lost.  Attempts to ask Google about the future of culture have brought absolutely nothing (maybe not so asked?).  I had to give up reading everything I had written and proceed to the generation of the environment of the future, for a while abandoning the concept of culture. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5fc/da7/8c7/5fcda78c76999327a9d19b839d4a1586.jpg"><br>  Yes, and do not try to look at the definition of <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D1%2583%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2582%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0">culture</a> in the Russian wikipedia - suitable if only for the duty report.  But it is worth seeing in the English version - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture">culture</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  But first, a short word about the word <i>culture</i> , which originally in Latin means cultivation, processing, cultivation.  Hence the word <i>cultivation</i> , i.e.  cultivating something.  The word culture has been a long time associated with the concept of cultivating the land and with agriculture in general, and even now we continue to call plants cultivated :) <br>  And only with a gradual and long stage of the invention of new tools, mechanisms and skills: an ax, a hammer, a pickaxe, matygi, wheels, carts, millstones, mills, domestication of a horse, etc.  there were people who were engaged only in their business, and were no longer tied to the earth.  There was a natural need to transfer accumulated skills and knowledge.  It is here that culture begins to penetrate into the understanding of the word an element of learning, education - implying the initial 'cultivation, cultivation, cultivation', but already of a man! <br>  A modern understanding of culture as a space associated with creativity, art, art, music, spiritual, mental, inner, etc.  appeared relatively stone ax quite recently - in the era of the so-called.  New time.  Scientists have divided the entire history of culture in the 20th century into certain epochs: <br>  * Primitive culture (up to 4 thousand BC. E.); <br>  * The culture of the Ancient World (4 thousand BC - 5th century AD), which distinguishes the culture of the Ancient East and the culture of Antiquity; <br>  * Culture of the Middle Ages (V ‚Äî XIV centuries); <br>  * Culture of the Renaissance or the Renaissance (XIV-XVI centuries); <br>  * Culture of the New Time (r. XVI-XIX centuries); <br>  * Culture of Modern Time (r. XIX - present. Time). <br>  I specifically brought this periodization.  I will tell you more about it! <br><br>  I will return to my desire to look beyond the ramp :) <br>  For a start, I will define for myself the horizon of the future.  I will send my eyes not to the distant date 2050, but to closer dates - I will talk about dates 2020-2030.  And the date 2050 itself, however colorful it would not have seemed, is still a way of the distant future.  After all, after 40 years :) Come on, add to your age ... That's right! <br>  Further, in order to form the initial image of the future, I will obviously limit myself only to forecasts of the development of technologies in different areas and the new opportunities and spaces they open.  I understand that I will not be able to embrace all areas in one fell swoop, so if there are additions - welcome to the comments with your examples and images. <br><br>  the image of the <b>information space</b> can already be seen today - everything is very realistic and very close in time, i.e.  There is no doubt that this will be soon :) Here and here is Microsoft's future vision of the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D1VuQeR-N8nE">house</a> , <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DV35Kv6-ZNGA">health</a> , <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DE_fIAE78tt0">store</a> , <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dnq3EeZz-W3A">office</a> , and Nokia‚Äôs future vision, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DA4pDf7m2UPE">home and surroundings</a> , <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DrpJQNMBNtOo">environment</a> , <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DM3KouGR1aiA">Natal</a> project.  In addition to these technologies, add the capabilities of holograms.  Already today, artists are beginning to actively use holograms.  But will artists need it tomorrow? !!!  :) <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/jWQIyV2Grqc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiENPOZrXi_nGtpGQx2mm4LEB8FTw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Obviously, information technologies will qualitatively change the media space.

The connection of computer, communications and content happened about 20 years ago, and now it is booming and will continue to develop at a lower rate.  But it is already obvious that in theaters the question of 'live' productions and productions with replaced virtual characters - holograms will arise.

The concepts of buildings such as a theater, library, school, cinema hall will expand significantly to places of communication, creativity and new production.

If you have enough strength and patience to read this far, then it's time for me to formulate a thesis about the culture of the future :) <br>  And here is the place to remember the very periodization of the history of culture, which ends in modern times.  Only here the latest time is already over thirty years ago ... :) <br>  There is a reasonable question, but what now, and what is most important, further, in the future? <br>  I don‚Äôt have answers, but the following picture is clearly forming: I believe that <b>culture</b> should ask all sharp questions, stir up and provoke reasoning, push to rethink the current arrangement, turn to the essence of the relationship between nature and man, about the dangers and possibilities of the new person, about a possible world order and worldview ... It is culture that can reveal and clearly demonstrate the inconsistency of old axioms in an impending future world, show the conventionality of forms and structures, notice new horizons  Options in the evolution of personal needs, self-transformation, sensory perception of the spiritual world. <br>  In our post-digital era, the issue of transboundary space <s>will come to the first place,</s> will affect all areas of human activity and supplant all other issues.  Many prejudices of the past (now present) will go into oblivion.  for example, the so-called copyright, giving way to creative communities and social design. <br><br>  At the end of the video with a forecast of human development :) <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ybfol6TAYi4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjetZnT8U8hjWhMeDO83xfL9cuPmw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  If it became interesting, here's another <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DD6ZxwWsem88">forecast.</a> <br><br>  Source: <a href="http://atner.livejournal.com/48747.html">my blog</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/102484/">https://habr.com/ru/post/102484/</a></p>
