The very concept of IT tambourines is as old as Windows 98. The idea that formed the basis of a tambourine - the use of disks and floppy disks - lies on the surface.  Already after I released my first version, I was shown pictures of similar tambourines, which were made long before mine, so I consider the original idea to be a folk one. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Prototype </h4><br>  After another torture with a computer, my girlfriend tearfully asked me to give her a tambourine for dancing around the system unit.  A couple of days later I had an idea how a real IT tambourine should look like, in the evening I made it.  As spindles for rings, a combination of rods from ordinary and gel pens was used, holes in the disks were made with scissors, and spindles were soldered into these holes.  (Rings from diskettes, by the way, I collected from school) <br>  The build quality was so low that the tambourine did not last more than a week.  And then began the process of "debugging" tambourine.

    <h4>  Version 1. </h4><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f09/8b0/a66/f098b0a66b0c5b569ae071e14fb6811e.jpg"></a> <br><br>  First of all, the handle bars were replaced with metal screws.  In the process of experimenting with various types of discs, it was found that the DVD is actually dual-layer.  One of the layers - purple, transparent and thin - is ideal as a membrane for a tambourine: it looks cool and resonates well. <br>  I then was a second year student, I have not earned programming yet.  When I published photos in LiveJournal, there were people who wanted to purchase this product (mostly as a gift) - for me it was a small addition to the scholarship.  There were quite a few orders, and I realized that this was a project. <br>  At some point, an order came not from Moscow.  This tambourine should be open source and distributed freely.  The fact that I was too lazy to mess with the mail should not have been an obstacle to the dissemination of the idea.  As a result, I published instructions for assembling tambourines on the Internet. <br>  The first version had a number of flaws, which can be seen in the pictures.  The holes were made with scissors - the discs cracked, and the cracks grew from the vibrations, and the tambourines quickly collapsed. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f16/0a7/018/f160a70188a4b214b21fd6d4f8f1735a.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Gradually, the technology was improved: a drill was used to drill holes - small cracks disappeared.  Then dremel appeared, which makes it convenient to cut holes in plastic - the bezel began to look better.  At one time I even used the rotation, as on a potter's wheel - I pinched the spindle with the disk in the drill, turned on the turns and cut out an even bezel. <br><br><h4>  Version 2. </h4><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/240/b27/4b2/240b274b235168caaeb26c17317f2c38.jpg"></a> <br><br>  About a year later I had a labelflash drive.  Coupled with my departure from the first job, this served as an incentive for the release of the second version.  The membrane has acquired the hieroglyphs from the "Matrix", the bezel - Celtic patterns. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/90e/db8/67e/90edb867e9103c18afad2516a1dea0bf.jpg"></a> <br>  With the release of each new unit, the quality of the tambourine improved: the whole marriage went into the trash - that was a crucial moment. <br><br><h4>  Version 3. </h4><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/baa/216/ac1/baa216ac13a4831badcf4eb2ab0baa05.jpg"></a> <br><br>  In the second version of the tambourine, I did not like the fact that construction fasteners were used.  I could not think for a long time how to use computer screws.  Recently, a technological solution to this problem has been found - after a small refinement, you can use torx screws from hard drives and racks for boards.  Last week, I sat down and in a day I collected the third version of the tambourine.  Now there are no non-kosher components in it: only disks, rings from floppy disks, screws from hard disks, racks from motherboards are used. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ab1/dbb/1f3/ab1dbb1f37117792838b95c08a5a8fad.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3bd/7cd/ae9/3bd7cdae96dfec8fdb06ace8970e1628.jpg"><br><br>  <i>The photos show a tambourine after a crash test with very strong blows.</i>  <i>Crashtest passed successfully - a couple of small cracks appeared and that's all.</i>  <i>Under normal use, such loads do not exist.</i> <br><br><h4>  Version 4? </h4><br>  I have ideas on the continuation of the line of tambourines with two more models, but they are still in their infancy. <br><br><h4>  Links </h4><br><ul><li>  Tambourine made before me ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/dihalt/" class="user_link">dihalt</a> ): <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/ru_radio_electr/106855.html">community.livejournal.com/ru_radio_electr/106855.html</a> </li><li>  The ‚Äúsources‚Äù of the tambourine (instructions for making) were originally published in LiveJournal, but they went over the Internet from here: <a href="http://www.lobzik.pri.ee/modules/smartsection/item.php%3Fitemid%3D194">www.lobzik.pri.ee/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=194</a> .
