What is unusual about him?  Yes, probably nothing but support for LTE networks and a pleasant price / functionality ratio.  Interested?  :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f51/8f1/648/f518f164812c623162cf2d129def7804.jpg" alt="kCeSN.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Iron </h1><br>  The issue of the middle segment and the price / performance ratio is regularly revised.  A few years ago, LG Optimus One conquered the budget segment precisely because it offered for its money what the rest didn‚Äôt have: a normal screen with a good resolution, quite current hardware and a good case, convenient, simple and reliable.

A year and a half ago, some manufacturers installed similar iron in their flagships. <br><br>  It is not clear why the camera did not get a flash, when it is even in the budget LG L5.  I do not think that an extra hole in the case and a kopek LED in any way would affect the cost of the device, moreover, the prototype <b>had a</b> flash that was shown on MWC2013, so in this respect the Koreans did some strange garbage. <br><br><h1>  Performance </h1><br>  As I said, a year and a half ago, these pieces of hardware could have been found in the flagship and HI-End devices of other companies, and today they are in a regular smartphone.  Is iron sufficient for modern needs?  In my opinion - yes. <br><br>  Take any review of the LG F5 on the Internet, and make sure that the authors say the same thing in it.  LG's software is well-optimized and smartly runs even on a much less productive gland of low-end models, so the word ‚Äúslows down‚Äù can be ignored altogether.  Samsung's budget and MID-Range models with their very heavy TouchWiz never dreamed of it. <br><br>  If someone is interested in the results of benchmarks, then here they are: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bfc/a5d/aaa/bfca5daaae34cfd87fb80550bc829b32.png" alt="OgcbL1otZ.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2e9/4a7/9c6/2e94a79c6a4182fdcadb0bdd23d80b51.png" alt="vzhnaE.png"><br><br><h1>  Display </h1><br>  The second important factor in the smartphone, which is positioned both as inexpensive and practical, is the screen.  In the end, we simply have no other way to interact with the device.  The F5 has an IPS matrix with a resolution of 960x540 pixels.  For a diagonal of 4.3 inches - quite a normal figure.  Of course, there are models with a HD resolution of 4.3 inches of the screen, but the user does not receive any tangible bonuses with the transition to 720p, but the cost of such a matrix, the brightness of the subsystem and the load on the graphics subsystem grow significantly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b54/ccd/11f/b54ccd11f6a2a81c5bbf00afd420de6a.jpg" alt="VAp2a.jpg"><br>  <sup>In the photo, the brightness is set to ~ 30% of the maximum.</sup> <br><br>  Viewing angles, color reproduction and brightness with contrast are at a good level.  The colors are pleasant, perhaps the device is a little ‚Äúyellow‚Äù (a little!), But I would not call it a very big drawback - the warm picture does not burden the eyes as much as the cool blue and blue shades with a white balance. <br><br><h1>  Design and body </h1><br>  This time I lowered the design and appearance of the case to the third position, and not for the reason that it does not deserve attention, but only due to the fact that in the middle segment there are more important aspects than a stylish appearance. <br><br>  The design is a direct continuation of the L-ruler, except that plastic is more expensive, and the overall design looks more like quite good models in the older segment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9c3/90b/46c/9c390b46c04cf8a9f008e1b1aab006aa.jpg" alt="k6fNUS5DG.jpg"><br><br>  The classic lineup of controls, connectors and pleasant to the touch materials + honest glass on top of the screen.  In general, everything is visible in the photos anyway. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dc0/4a7/028/dc04a70283f5418110450b4b0c873a4c.jpg" alt="G5vNub7Zm.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c0e/773/4e0/c0e7734e0891b18975cb4fef0891acf6.jpg" alt="cX2MoT.jpg"><br><br><h1>  LTE </h1><br>  Frankly, the feelings are twofold.  On the one hand, the feature is interesting, and in the middle segment you will not find it in the afternoon.  On the other hand, the coverage map leaves much to be desired ... But there is one ‚Äúbut‚Äù.  As soon as we get into the fourth generation network coverage area, the Internet becomes difficult to distinguish from good Wi-Fi connectivity.  The speed in the region of 10 megabits (sometimes higher), fast connection, good latency - in general, maybe you don‚Äôt play much in BattleField, but you‚Äôre comfortable using the Internet, maps, watching videos or even connecting through TeamViewer for remote control - it's always welcome .  Moreover, the rest of the stuffing allows you to work quite comfortably with other applications, switch between several tasks and generally the tendency to ‚Äúdescend‚Äù hi end features in the MID segment is good news.  Today - LTE, and tomorrow, you see, stop the settling chambers in the middle segment shove.  Speaking of the camera ... <br><br><h1>  Camera </h1><br>  5 megapixel autofocus module with no flash.  On the one hand, it‚Äôs good that not 10 or 13 bloated MPxs are smaller than the size of photos, but there would still be as many details.  On the other - where the flash, and people do not understand why they did not put at least 8, which is in the same LG L7.  Personally, I didn‚Äôt work on the camera especially: the weather in Moscow was disgusting, there was nothing to shoot, and she wouldn‚Äôt provide anything interesting in any case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bd0/274/417/bd0274417b84bfcbc5c9171507e6ea76.jpg" alt="GMwvB.jpg"><br><br>  But the guys from Mobile Review drove the device to the tail and mane, and they also characterize the camera as ‚Äúaverage on all fronts‚Äù.  I hope the engineers at LG will reach the camera in the near future, rewrite all the software and find and punish the person who was in charge of the chamber JPG.  It seems that they are not small, they wrote an intelligent shell, the devices do quite good, even Goolge chose them as a supplier for Nexus-smartphones, and they won‚Äôt master the camera software. <br><br>  In general, here are a couple of my shots, some shots from the Internet, and then decide for yourself how many boots you should throw in the direction of the software development department for cameras in the LG office. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Hidden text</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aa0/a4a/bd6/aa0a4abd6753fbe7a50dc9844c875c08.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/19d/455/0d2/19d4550d25de851657ba90c5c94d8983.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/19d/f62/14c/19df6214c38d4b8cafe643e3f73aa872.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b67/274/7f7/b672747f7fe2caf98ac4c183e744042e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2f0/113/af2/2f0113af2823b52c6571ed9792f440e9.jpg"><br></div></div><br><br><h1>  Competitors </h1><br>  If we consider only PCT devices, then in this price range (from 10 to 12 thousand rubles), F5 has many competitors, on the one hand, and probably not on the other.  Hi-end smartphones two years ago live in such a price range, some mid-range devices of this and past years, and all of them are ‚Äúgood‚Äù in their own way.  Who shoved the HD-screen, and because of this, the smartphone has become a lag.  Somewhere dead battery somewhere foolish case, or, conversely, the screen is so-so.  Yes, and LTE is one and a half diggers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/79f/d2c/c6f/79fd2cc6f0ed7615231ec88d73955b4c.jpg" alt="SlMqIRG.jpg"><br><br>  Among the "gray" devices, the competition, of course, is intensifying, but let's be honest: can you imagine how much the "gray" F5 will cost?  :) <br><br><h1>  Instead of conclusion </h1><br>  LG turned out to be a good and strong middle one: normal glands, a good screen, a nice shell that doesn‚Äôt make the user cry with bloody tears due to clown decoration, brakes or strange decisions.  Plus LTE.  Samsung has won, not in all the fourth galaxies.  :) With autonomy, there are also no problems - the iron is not the most voracious, and the battery got from much more ‚Äúcharged‚Äù Optimus G. <br><br>  Not without drawbacks: so-so camera, no flash (for which flash something ?!), a glossy backdrop will turn into a scratched glossy backdrop after a year.  I miss the covers in the style of the Galaxy S II - from durable, flexible and corrugated plastic, without any hint of vulgar gloss. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7ab/948/bb3/7ab948bb3f628acce14c665fedb475c4.jpg" alt="angzsuU.jpg"><br><br>  If we take into account the price of the device and all the features offered by it - I would put 4 points out of 5 possible.  Matte case + flash - and all 6 out of 5 would be. Simple, fast, inexpensive, with a nice screen, and LTE can also (which means you can connect to a laptop, in which case, and not suffer from the ‚Äúquality‚Äù of 3G networks. What else is necessary for happiness, if you are not ready to give 20-30 thousand for a smartphone? :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/189562/">https://habr.com/ru/post/189562/</a></p>
