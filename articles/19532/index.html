  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Thinking out loud: about popularizing Jabber. Easy way [without brakes]</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Looking at the heated debates -&gt; about <a href="http://senlik.habrahabr.ru/blog/34877.html">ICQ</a> and <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/tag/jabber/">Jabber</a> , which often lead to ‚Äú <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/tag/skype">Skype taxis</a> ‚Äù, I ask myself: <s>would I be a jabb</s> ‚Äúand what would attract me so much to Jabber that it would allow me to switch to it as the main IM?‚Äù <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Historically, the "first IM-love" of those who live on the Internet for about 10 years or more, of course, ICQ.  Newly connected, as a rule, socially connected with old connected also chose ICQ.  As a result, in fact, the only reason for holding back changes is the reluctance to lose social ties when switching to a new IM, because often the majority of those who live <a href="http://vkontakte.ru/"><em>in the contact</em> list</a> are far from IT, often <a href="http://odnoklassniki.ru/">classmates</a> , <a href="http://moikrug.ru/">current and former colleagues</a> , and everyone. rational, at first glance, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/im/33878.html">agitation</a> based on the fact that, descade, this protocol is ‚Äúbetter‚Äù, ‚Äúfreer‚Äù - in the eyes of an ordinary person - is irrational and in general renders it religious. <br><br>  So the main reason is social connections.  And even the frequent glitches of third-party ICQ-clients associated with the change of the protocol are not able to discourage the desire to communicate through this service. <br><br>  <em>And if you pledge to a potential user that during the transition to Jabber, not only all of his old social connections will remain, but even those that seemed to have disappeared irretrievably?</em>

      Moreover, the prerequisites for this are. <br><br>  I will explain what I mean. <br><br>  It seems that the logical stage in the development of many social networks and <a href="http://livejournal.com/">services built on their basis</a> was the introduction into the system of some kind of personal mail (for example, ‚Äúu-mail‚Äù, in diary.ru, etc), and then IM (Instant Messaging) .  Moreover, if mail.ru followed the path of creating its own instant messaging tool, thereby aggravating network fragmentation, livejournal and google chose an existing one - jabber. <br><br>  Moreover, the advantages of such integration are obvious - the user, for the first time connecting to the IM service, finds himself in a friendly environment - into the network of social connections he has already created.  In the same livejournal - all friends are automatically added to the contact list. <br><br>  However, as it seems to me, in the case of livejournal, the attempt to introduce jabber by and large has failed.  The reason is in the properties and nature of the links in the Russian segment of the livejournal: ‚Äúfriends‚Äù are most often those who are interested in reading, and the whole need for communication is realized in the blog format.  In addition, the overlap of contacts in LJ and ICQ was often insignificant (for me it was about 15% - this is too little to switch to Jabber from LJ). <br><br>  It is quite another thing ‚Äúclean‚Äù social networks like Odnoklassniki, Vkontakte, Moykrug and others - these services provide limited functionality for communication, which I could compensate and compensate for the integrated Instant Messenger, the introduction of which on these portals, I think, is just a question of time. <br><br>  And now let's imagine how it would be possible to use Jabber, and what are its advantages.  Not much touching the technical side (firstly, because I am not familiar with it at the proper level, and secondly, it does not matter at this stage). <br><br>  Many of us are registered in all the above-mentioned services, and, obviously, if you add up all the connections that are in them and compare this base with your contact list in ICQ - I think the overlap will be more than half, or even more than two thirds is much more favorable for migration. <br><br>  All this, of course, would be possible only if: <br>  1) all of the above services have implemented Jabber, <br>  2) it would be possible to link accounts on different Jabber servers, either at the level of a meta server or a client.  (Of course, there‚Äôs another problem - duplication of contacts simultaneously existing in different services - one way or another, you have to explain that <em>Ivan Ivanov Ivangoe Ivan</em> from <em>VKontakte</em> is <em>Peter Peter Petrov</em> from classmates. Perhaps there are more elegant solutions. <br>  Question to XMPP connoisseurs - how to make it all beautiful?) <br><br>  In general, I understand what I mean?  =) <br><br>  In this situation, the phrase <em>‚Äúto promise the potential user that when switching to Jabber, not only all his old social ties will remain, but even those that seemed to have disappeared irretrievably‚Äù will</em> be restored, becomes more truthful, especially in the ‚Äúrestoration‚Äù part old friends will still fall on your head (and in contact and in classmates, etc., automatically appearing in the Jabber contact list). <br><br>  <strong>I summarize</strong> : the bright and cloudless future of the jabber, perhaps, in the hands of those explosively developing social networks (with their huge user bases) that will take it into service.  It remains only to convince them that they need it =) <br>  (Well, of course, a single integrated solution based on this (client, or meta-server + client), which allows you to combine contact databases and accounts.) <br><br>  Dear jabber-activists - this is probably a good point of application of effort =) <br><br>  PS Issues of spam, security and other things - I don‚Äôt touch, as this is a separate topic. <br>  PPS Most likely the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãchoosing just such an ‚Äúagitation‚Äù direction is not new.  It seemed to me obvious =) However, habrahabr, it seems, has not yet risen. <br><br>  <strong>Update:</strong> It seems more correct to reformulate the idea in the direction of a certain ‚ÄúJabber-OpenID‚Äù, since there are an incredible amount of social networks - potential suppliers of ‚Äúfriends‚Äù. <br><br><blockquote>  And it would be better not to force each of them to deploy via a Jabber server, and then reap the benefits of such segmentation, but simply give a mechanism by which a person would automatically receive donated confidential / correspondents (aka "friends") from a certain social service directly to jabber contact list. <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/im/34925.html">Read more...</a> </blockquote><br><br>  <strong>Update2:</strong> During the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/im/34925.html">discussion,</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/klaus/" class="user_link">klaus</a> Klaus ‚Äúdried‚Äù the idea and got a combination of <a href="http://futuri.us/2008/01/31/utopiya-pwn-73h-1n73rn375/">Jabber + OpenID + OAuth</a> .  I quote: <br><blockquote>  There is a certain site, provider OpenID, OAuth and Jabber. <br>  * OpenID - connects your profiles to different social networks <br>  * OAuth - allows Jabber server to get lists of friends and their contacts <br>  <a href="http://futuri.us/2008/01/31/utopiya-pwn-73h-1n73rn375/">Read more...</a> <br></blockquote><br>  <strong>Update3:</strong> Not really, but close -&gt; <a href="http://www.jabber.ru/node/261">www.jabber.ru/node/261</a> <br>  <a href="http://openid.xmpp.za.net/">openid.xmpp.za.net</a> - integration of XMPP and OpenID. <br><blockquote>  Many of you have heard about OpenID technology.  One of its uses is the ability to comment on many blogs without registration, for example, the famous Livejournal.  The underlying part of the implementation of this technology assumed the existence of its own blog site. <br><br>  However, if you are a Jabber user, then using the <a href="http://openid.xmpp.za.net/">openid.xmpp.za.net</a> service and your Jabber client, you can log in using OpenID without worrying about the need to remember hundreds of passwords.  Simply answer ‚ÄúOK‚Äù to a request to authorize a site in your Jabber client. <br></blockquote><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/19532/">https://habr.com/ru/post/19532/</a></p>
