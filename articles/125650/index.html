  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Evernote support on HTC Flyer</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="http://blog.evernote.com/ru/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/image09.jpg" title="image09" width="650" height="494"><br>  We always try to talk about products that are integrated with Evernote.  Today's story is a special one, since it will not be about the application, but about the device, the developers of which spent a lot of effort on integrating with Evernote.  It's about the tablet <strong>HTC Flyer</strong> .  This pleasant device with a 7-inch touchscreen running Android has a proprietary HTC Sense interface, comes bundled with a pen and HTC Scribe handwriting technology and features easy integration with Evernote right out of the box. <br><br>  HTC Flyer has a staffed application ‚ÄúNotes‚Äù that allows you to create text, graphic and audio notes, and also - and we like it most - to make handwritten notes on top of screenshots of web pages, photos and other images using a stylus.  And ‚ÄúNotes‚Äù, in fact, are a full-fledged Evernote client application.  However, first things first. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  application </h3>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      The ‚ÄúNotes‚Äù application can be launched by clicking on the corresponding icon on the home screen launch bar: <br><br><img src="http://blog.evernote.com/ru/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/home-screen.jpg" title="home screen" width="640" height="375"><br><br>  When you first start the application, you can configure the binding to your Evernote account (and those who do not have an account are invited to create it right there). <br><br><img src="http://blog.evernote.com/ru/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/acc.jpg" title="acc" width="400" height="373"><br><br>  After connecting, the program will offer to synchronize existing local notes with Evernote.  This may take some time, depending on the number of notes and the speed of Internet access, so we recommend doing the initial synchronization over a Wi-Fi connection.  In the future, the default synchronization will be carried out automatically and completely transparent to the user, but you can also start it manually from the main menu of the application. <br><br>  The menu is called by pressing the button of the same name on the bottom touch panel of the tablet and, in the note view, gives not only access to synchronization, but also allows you to search, create, delete notes, customize the display and sort, delete or rename notebooks (similar to ‚Äúnotebooks‚Äù in terminology). Evernote): <br><br><img src="http://blog.evernote.com/ru/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/main-menu.jpg" title="main menu" width="400" height="261"><br><br>  And in the upper left part of the ‚ÄúAll Notes‚Äù screen there is a button bar with the most important functions: working with notebooks, searching and creating a new note. <br><br><img src="http://blog.evernote.com/ru/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/all-notes.jpg" title="all notes" width="400" height="683"><br><br>  The first of these buttons allows you to create a new book or go to one of the existing ones.  By creating a notebook, you can clarify whether to leave it local or allow synchronization with Evernote (all as in ‚Äúadult‚Äù Evernote clients): <br><br><img src="http://blog.evernote.com/ru/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/choose-notebook.jpg" title="choose notebook" width="400" height="406"><br><br><h3>  Work with a note </h3><br><br>  To create a note, open the notebook in which you want to put a record, and click on the "+" icon.  If you create a record from the screen with all the notes, it will be placed in the default notebook. <br><br>  In the window for creating a note, you can set its title and, in fact, the text: <br><br><img src="http://blog.evernote.com/ru/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/new-note..jpg" title="new note." width="400" height="683"><br><br>  Using the button bar at the top of the screen, you can attach a snapshot from the camera, an arbitrary file, as well as an audio recording to the note. <br><br>  The camera button opens the shooting interface.  The tablet is equipped with two cameras - with the help of the 5-megapixel main camera you can take very decent pictures, and the 1.3-megapixel front-facing camera will allow you to take pictures of yourself from the history of yourself. <br><br>  The paperclip icon allows you to attach an image from previously saved images and photos, an existing audio file, video (you can either take it from an archive or take it specially for a note), a document (PDF or Microsoft Office file) and, finally, an arbitrary file. using the built-in file manager to select an object.  Here is the way to a <a href="http://www.evernote.com/about/intl/ru/premium/">premium subscription Evernote</a> , which, among other things, allows you to synchronize files of any type and increases the maximum size of one note from 25 to 50 megabytes. <br><br>  Further in the menu there is a separate button for recording a voice note, by clicking on which a voice recorder is turned on, and a timer bar appears below.  Recording is completed by pressing the button again.  The resulting audio note can be immediately played using the playback control buttons. <br><br><img src="http://blog.evernote.com/ru/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/audio.jpg" title="audio" width="400" height="121"><br><br>  Now one of the company's application chips is the ability to link an edited note to a specific event scheduled in the Calendar application.  To do this, click the corresponding icon in the panel and select an event from the list.  For example, you can make audio recordings of discussions devoted to launching a new project and immediately link them to the date of this launch in the calendar: <br><br><img src="http://blog.evernote.com/ru/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/calend..jpg" title="calend" width="400" height="309"><br><br>  Changes to the note are automatically saved after pressing the ‚ÄúBack‚Äù button in the tablet menu, but you can save the note manually. <br><br><h3>  Manuscripts that do not burn </h3><br><br>  We now turn to the main highlight of the tablet as a whole and ‚ÄúNotes‚Äù in particular - working with a pen. <br><br>  With it, it is convenient to take screenshots of applications and web pages.  Simply open the corresponding program or site, touch any part of the screen with a stylus, after which the tablet switches to the Outline mode and takes a picture.  To save it as a note right away, tap your finger on any part of the screen and select the appropriate action from the pop-up menu.  Well, and you can draw something on it before saving: <br><br><img src="http://blog.evernote.com/ru/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/overnote..jpg" title="overnote." width="400" height="471"><br><br>  To determine the color, thickness and type of pen, you need to click on the rightmost icon of the lower touchpad of the tablet to call the tool palette.  Here are the modes of the pencil, ballpoint pen, brush, calligraphic pen, marker, text highlighter and eraser.  It is worth noting that the pen has the physical buttons of the eraser and the text selector to quickly switch to the appropriate mode.  In addition to the above options, the menu allows you to undo / redo an action, show / hide all notes made by a pen and send draft notes to the basket. <br><br><img src="http://blog.evernote.com/ru/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/penmenu..jpg" title="penmenu." width="278" height="260"><br><br>  Working with sketches using the pen is implemented conveniently and naturally, you get used to the interface literally in the first minutes of use.  This mode opens wide possibilities for creating notes of any topic and orientation. <br><br>  First, it allows you to highlight significant areas of text in the screenshot of a web page or document underlined or circled, even in those applications that do not support text selection mode. <br><br>  Secondly, a separate category of the application of sketches is the ability to draw and add your notes over the saved image by hand.  So, you can indicate dubious moments right on the design layout, along the way schematically sketching how you would do it and adding a comment to it.  Then you can attach this note to a meeting with the designer, noted in the calendar, and also, using the collaboration options in Evernote, immediately open to colleagues access to their comments. <br><br>  Well and thirdly, all these notes come through <strong>the Evernote handwriting recognition system</strong> .  That is, after synchronizing the notes with Evernote, it can be found on the notes in the margins that you made. <br><br><img src="http://blog.evernote.com/ru/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/map1..jpg" title="map1." width="400" height="683"><br><br>  Photographed a diagram on the board during the meeting?  Menu in the restaurant?  Interesting building during the tour?  Go to the outline of the outline and immediately comment on the photo of your thoughts on the project, underline your favorite dish or sign the name of the building directly on top of the photo. <br><br>  Or, as in the previous screenshot, directly on the map, designate a route plan by circling key cities and required places to visit and adding the necessary information.  And in the same note, then you can enter or copy the detailed data on tickets, background information, such as opening hours of museums, or a list of traditional dishes of the region that you definitely need to try.  Have any thoughts on the go?  Add a voice comment to the note. <br><br><img src="http://blog.evernote.com/ru/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/maps2..jpg" title="maps2." width="400" height="683"><br><br>  The ability at any time to make a mark on the material being viewed drastically changes even the approach to web surfing.  It‚Äôs just amazing how quickly the habit of capturing your impressions and comments about what you see and read on the Internet right at the time of viewing the page. <br><br><img src="http://blog.evernote.com/ru/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/serf..jpg" title="serf." width="640" height="375"><br><br>  From the outline mode menu, you can save an image with your notes, send it to print (via Wi-Fi), send to another device via Bluetooth, send an e-mail or publish on social networks.  A note in Evernote will fall automatically during the next synchronization. <br><br>  Well, of course, you can use HTC Flyer as a traditional notebook in the classic sense of the word, writing down your thoughts, sketches and ideas with a pen.  Thanks to the mentioned ability of Evernote to recognize not only printed but also handwritten text, these notes will be searchable as well as others - typed on the keyboard - notes. <br><br><img src="http://blog.evernote.com/ru/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/handwrite.jpg" title="handwrite" width="640" height="480"><br><br>  Summing up, we can say that HTC gave us an example of extremely successful integration of the tablet with Evernote, which not only makes working with our service comfortable, but also opens up a wide range of new ways to use their additional memory for active users.  HTC Flyer has turned out to be a powerful tool for working with notes.  So if you are choosing a tablet now, then you should at least take a closer look at this device. <br><br>  <strong>***</strong> <br><br>  And now the announcement: soon one of our followers on Twitter will become the owner of this tablet.  <a href="http://twitter.com/evernote_ru">Join us</a> and follow the news. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/125650/">https://habr.com/ru/post/125650/</a></p>
