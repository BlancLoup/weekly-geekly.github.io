On that very day, when <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/kenobi/" class="user_link">kenobi</a> wrote his <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/web_2_0/26748/">article</a> on <a href="http://www.plurk.com/">Plurk</a> .  On the very day when I <a href="http://www.plurk.com/user/ognevsky">registered</a> there.  On that very day, when in one fell swoop I had an incredible number of <a href="http://www.plurk.com/Friends/showFriendsBasic%3Fuser_id%3D23232">friends</a> , many of whom still delight me with their presence in icq, jabber and other interesting places. <br><br>  It was summer, there was a vacation, and it was a carefree time: I spent several hours a day on Plurk (to tell the truth, I spent all my ‚Äúcomputer‚Äù time on it!).  Then time was sorely missed, and after some deliberation, I stopped reading other people's messages on Plurka: I wrote my own, read the answers.  A few days ago I wrote a message that I was leaving definitively.  I left, but I don‚Äôt regret the time I spent there. <br><br>  My alter ego <a href="http://twitter.com/ognevsky">moved</a> to <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> , since Plurk helped me add to my friends list. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Closer to the point </h4>  This morning I received an invite (from comrade <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/ainokaze/" class="user_link">ainokaze</a> ) for the next microblogging service - Kwippy.  In this article I will try to talk about what the developers wanted to achieve, and how they (in my humble opinion) did it.  So, meet: <a href="http://www.kwippy.com/">Kwippy</a> !

    <h4>  The essence </h4>  Registration on the site - by invitation.  But, interestingly, invitations can be sent to all registered (by the same invitation) users.  If you need invitations - leave your e-mail, I will <s>add it to my spam database, I</s> will try to send you an invite. <br><br>  Immediately after registration, you will be asked to enter your Twitter username / password (optional).  Interestingly, this data is not saved on the site, but is used only to compile a list of friends. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4a7/34a/e5a/4a734ae5ad03e21739c0363f5c7eb819.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Enter the data, click Submit, and get the following: <br><img src="http://www.picamatic.com/show/2008/10/22/08/25/1227259_640x403.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I still admire the guys, and for good reason!  On this form, all users are divided into 3 categories (only 2 are visible in the screenshot): those who have already registered, who have not yet received an invite (they are not in the screenshot), and who received an invite, but have not registered yet.  What did I like about this performance?  And the fact that one person will not receive 20 invites from his friends, maximum 1! <br><br><h4>  Twitter or Plurk? </h4>  What did Kwippi look like: Twitter or Plyuk?  Here's a picture for you, decide: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a3c/beb/a89/a3cbeba8908d09b1038dc4ea9b6a7dc9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  If you look at the functionality, it‚Äôs a mixture of Twitter and Plurk (something like Jaiku): you can write your own messages (in the manner of Twitter) and comment on them (in the manner of Plurk).  Typical such Jaiku, without the ability to insert rss tapes (although it is better not to insert them at all than the way Jaiku inserts them). <br><br>  As can be seen from the last picture - messages (so far!) Are added without any ajax, as is customary in the Internet lately. <br><br><h4>  Status message </h4>  A distinctive feature of Qippy is gtalk-bot, which will helpfully (along with, or instead of the mail) will inform you about new messages, changes and other crap happening on the site. <br><br>  In addition, if you suddenly decide to change the status message in gtalk'e - you will have a new message on the site (this can be seen at the very top of the last picture).  And Kvippy can be made friends with Facebook and Yahoo: then the "local" status will be transferred to Kvippy ( <i>not yet tried, naked theory!</i> ) <br><br><h4>  User Profile </h4>  If you want to see an advanced user profile, you will see it.  But I do not promise that you will immediately like it. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/365/928/aa6/365928aa605dd5bbb49c8fcaeac7732a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Of course, the designer and coder has a lot to strive for, but we will make a discount on the novelty of the project.  I think that by the common efforts of those who find this interesting, everything will be done in the near future. <br><br>  I think, for a short review, the text is already enough, for whom it is interesting - write in the comments, I will send an invite.  The project is worth a visit.  At least in order to understand how it is worth / not worth doing some things. <br><br>  That's all, until we meet again, gentlemen and comrades!  May the horse, the bucket and the Good, be with you! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/42951/">https://habr.com/ru/post/42951/</a></p>
