  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why Joomla Fails in Russia</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In this article I want to talk about CMS Joomla, leaving holivar behind, which CMS is better, I will tell you about why Joomla, with all its popularity in the west, is still not recognized in Russia. <br><br>  With all the advantages and disadvantages of Joomla, on the forums more often you can see the statements "Joomla sucks", etc.  As a rule, statements of such a plan are due to the ignorance of the person who writes such a review.  With the same confidence, a schoolchild can say that Yii or Drupal sucks just because they have never seen them or could not master them properly.  However, about Yii and Drupal there are not so many such statements, and in Habr√© they are respected.  So let's see what the problem is? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And so why CMS Joomla, perhaps, one of the most popular systems in the world, is not recognized in Russia? <br><br>  First, let's look at the story: It will be a short link to the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joomla">wiki</a> .

      Look, the whole Joomla story is <b>jumping from one branch to another</b> , since I found both mambo and joomla 1.0 and all subsequent branches, I can say that each jump from branch to branch was sifted out by a part of the Joomla community.  Forks were created, attempts to update the old branches, but all this led to nothing.  While the same WP almost all its history went smoothly and almost painlessly. <br><br>  I think that the most terrible thing for the Joomla community in Russia is exactly the transition from Joomla 1.0 to Joomla 1.5, then there was a very big split and the release of the Joostina fork, I think, they are still experiencing the consequences of this split.  Although the fork itself has actually died due to the fact that its developers have changed priorities. <br><br>  The next problem is the <b>lack of public activity at the community itself</b> .  If we say the Drupal community regularly shines on all sorts of conferences and has a fairly strong lobby, in every possible way PR has its own CMS, then the Joomla community has almost no such activity.  Ask why?  I will give you the answer, I do not know.  Given that there are enough strong studios that make websites using Joomla, they are not interested in promoting this system among businesses.  Rather, the approach reigns, the client should not think about what kind of cms it is worth.  The community itself is busy with its own problems and the release of the next webmaster group, with different qualifications.  And the promotion of CMS is almost not engaged. <br><br>  <b>Poor quality frames</b> is probably the cornerstone of Joomla's bad reputation.  In reality, the community, which thinks they can make websites, releases such a number of people that they simply marvel at it.  I have been creating websites for more than 10 years, I have mastered many tools for developing them, I don‚Äôt declare with such confidence that I can develop a mega-portal alone in a couple of weeks.  Unfortunately, every 2nd graduate of the Joomla community, either trying to make his mega-portal, or trying to sell their services to create such portals.  What we have as a result, the site is of mediocre quality, on a template (since the truth that you have to pay for everything, a person at this level of development cannot reach), with errors in structuring, in general, a typical hack on the knee, who for the first time made his ‚Äúhompage‚Äù.  Comments about what the person who ordered the site thinks, I think, will be superfluous. <br><br>  This problem implies the following: a <b>freebie, the opinion that Joomla is free</b> , but it excites schoolchildren, although it also does not leave adult uncles, but the opinion that everything should be free and in large quantities destroys the system for free.  The first is because people do not study using constructors, the second is because the abundance of ‚ÄúVarese‚Äù, which is often infected, affects sites' epidemics, people just don‚Äôt understand (due to low qualifications) that they will still pay something , or ‚Äúshell‚Äù, or at least a bunch of links on the site. <br><br>  Summing up, I want to say that Joomla is good enough, like a CMS, it is fairly balanced and can probably provide everything that you can imagine right now.  This is the native bootstrap, this is its own ‚Äúframework‚Äù, and a fairly wide and flexible API, and of course a lot of various extensions and integration, plus high security, code recognized as the best among open source CMS.  There is probably everything in it, but in Russia there is such a situation that: <br><ul><li>  The leaders do not want to convey the benefits of the system to the final business. </li><li>  Bottoms can not do this due to either limited resources or insufficient experience and other reasons. </li></ul><br><br>  I do not urge anyone to use CMS Joomla, I just think that this article will be interesting, both to people who have never used the system, and to people who use this CMS, but are pushing for alienation from business or colleagues in the creation shop sites. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/160389/">https://habr.com/ru/post/160389/</a></p>
