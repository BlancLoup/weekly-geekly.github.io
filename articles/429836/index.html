      If you look at the list of supported systems, the absence of MacOS in it immediately becomes noticeable.  However, this is so only until Chrome v72 is released. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0d1/11c/afb/0d111cafb21de81d02f7e02e228c723c.png"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Desktop PWA support on MacOS</font></i> <br><br>  It is important to note that although this feature is not enabled by default in MacOS, it can be activated using the appropriate flag.  To do this, open Chrome, go to <a href="">chrome: // flags</a> and find this flag there.  You can go directly to the flag by using the <a href="">chrome: // flags / # enable-desktop-pwas link</a> . <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">What are progressive web applications?</font> </h2><br>  We will not go into specific details regarding the PWA.  <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/">Here is a</a> section of Google documentation where you can read about them.  In order to see with your own eyes PWA and try them in action, open Chrome for Android or Safari in iOS (though not all PWA features are supported here) and see <a href="https://medium.com/%40the_manifest/11-examples-of-progressive-web-apps-944f6db25a5a">these</a> examples.  And <a href="https://youtu.be/NITk4kXMQDw">here</a> is a presentation on this topic with Google I / O '18. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">What is Electron?</font> </h2><br>  <a href="https://electronjs.org/">Electron</a> is a platform that allows developers to create cross-platform desktop applications using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.  It also uses some great JavaScript libraries and frameworks.  This makes it easier for web programmers to enter into the development of desktop applications.  Electron-based applications have gained immense popularity in recent years.  Within such projects as Slack, VS Code, Atom, Discord, considerable forces were invested in developing applications using Electron.  If these projects are not familiar to you, then you definitely should look at the relevant applications and services.  Traditional desktop applications often seemed clumsy, their interface elements looked like something outdated.  Electron definitely brought beauty and elegance to the world of desktop applications. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">What does the PWA?</font> </h2><br>  Although Electron applications are a growing and evolving phenomenon, and their implementation is close to the implementation of web applications, they still have some drawbacks.  First, such applications use their own instances of the Chromium browser.  Many people know about how much RAM you need to run Chrome.  Now, in order to assess the situation arising in the system while simultaneously running several Electron-applications, it is necessary to take their number and multiply by this amount of memory.  If interested, open up several Electron applications and see how much memory they consume. <br><br>  Excessive use of memory is not very good in itself, and here it is necessary to add that many Electron applications interact in a specific way with Node.js, without necessarily doing it the same way as the corresponding web applications. <br><br>  Using Electron adds difficulties associated with supporting old versions of programs and adjusting the process of updating applications. <br><br>  Now let's talk about desktop PWA.  Imagine applications that look like those written on Electron, with which it is also convenient to work, but at the same time installing them is as simple as they are, they are also updated without any problems, during the transfer of a single web application to the client.  There is a feeling that Chrome sets the standard for such a scenario of behavior in desktop PWA.  When a user working in Chrome visits a certain web page and the application submitted to it meets <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/checklist">this</a> set of criteria, the application developer will be able to suggest the user to install the application on his computer.  The invitation looks something like the one below. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/76f/303/1d1/76f3031d1e1224c727366652aa330797.png"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">PWA Installation Invitation</font></i> <br><br>  The developer can show this invitation only after the browser <code>beforeinstallprompt</code> <code>window</code> <code>beforeinstallprompt</code> event.  After installing the application on the desktop icon appears. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/99d/7b8/b91/99d7b8b91b8b76fef44c023113884c8c.png"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Icon to run PWA</font></i> <br><br>  After launching such an application, it opens in a browser window that is not equipped with the usual controls.  Such an application is perceived as a real desktop application. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d3b/1ce/31c/d3b1ce31c0d2b9d79205b4738b5b83eb.png"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Running PWA</font></i> <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">PWA Example</font> </h2><br>  <a href="https://www.desktop-pwas.com/">Here is</a> an example of a desktop PWA, the screenshots of which were used above as illustrations.  <a href="https://github.com/supercycle91/desktop-pwas">Here is</a> its repository on github.  In order to install this application, you need to enable the corresponding flag in Chrome and spend at least 30 seconds on the site. <br><br>  As already mentioned, a web application, in order to be considered a desktop PWA, must meet a specific set of <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/checklist">requirements</a> .  If you want to create and test your own desktop PWA, you can take <a href="https://github.com/supercycle91/desktop-pwas">this</a> repository as a basis and take into account the requirements.  If you make a brief summary of them, you get the following: <br><br><ul><li>  The application must be serviced by HTTPS. </li><li>  It must have an installed service worker with at least one <code>fetch</code> handler. </li><li>  It should contain a properly designed <code>manifest.json</code> file. </li><li>  Its pages should be designed using responsive design techniques. </li></ul><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Additional examples</font> </h2><br>  If you are working on MacOS, then PWA may find that you cannot install them, and will not show you an invitation to install them.  If you enable the appropriate flags and tinker with the developer console, you can get from PWA that they will display an invitation to install.  Here are some of the existing PWA, which managed to install on Mac. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñçStarbucks</font> </h3><br>  Starbucks has put a lot of effort into developing a great PWA.  Their desktop application turned out really impressive. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d87/d7b/77c/d87d7b77c73d5b3d922a274f5339cc6f.png"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">PWA Starbucks</font></i> <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">MapsGoogle Maps</font> </h3><br>  This is just a great app.  It does its job and does not particularly burden the system, featuring fast work and responsive design.  To install this application you need to fake and download the Google Maps mobile site. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4a4/795/187/4a4795187e738cc0ccdee4fe64e5dbbe.png"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">PWA google maps</font></i> <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">WitterTwitter</font> </h3><br>  Twitter has tried to develop mobile PWA, and the desktop version can be considered a worthy addition to the mobile application. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8ee/0ef/86c/8ee0ef86cc3b81e50f3f14ce23d2ec36.png"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">PWA Twitter</font></i> <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Results</font> </h2><br>  Despite the fact that a lot of noise has been raised around desktop PWA, you need to be aware that this technology is still in its infancy.  In particular, the following areas of desktop PWA development can be noted: <br><br><ul><li>  Deep links: links opened from Chrome invoke the installed application. </li><li>  Notifications on application icons: display notifications on launch icons for desktop applications, just as they do on mobile application icons. </li><li>  Hot key support: the ability to listen to keyboard events for use inside hot key applications. </li></ul><br>  After the development of desktop technology PWA sufficiently developed, these applications will become serious competitors of today's projects based on Electron. <br><br>  <b>Dear readers!</b>  Do you plan to develop desktop PWA? <br><br> <a href="https://ruvds.com/ru-rub/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1ba/550/d25/1ba550d25e8846ce8805de564da6aa63.png"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/429836/">https://habr.com/ru/post/429836/</a></p>
