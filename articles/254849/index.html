  <section class="page js-page"><h1>As we say</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The Russian language is rich and original, but we tirelessly fill it with new words from a field of knowledge in which either the terminology is poorly developed or the use of another language is much more convenient. <br>  The number of borrowings from English in the speech of the IT-employed population goes beyond all imaginable limits.  It is often easier to speak English, since only unions and excuses remain in the speech in Russian.  But here it is more convenient to whom.  Borrowing in a language is a natural and understandable process, and it seems to me that it is quite logical to assume that the borrowed word should conform to the rules of the Russian language and should not look completely alien in it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  However, one constantly hears around the use of words not just in borrowed, but in borrowed-distorted form.  And this is despite the fact that there is already a less distorted and alien to the ear version. <br><br>  I will give a few examples: <br>  1) ‚ÄúFix‚Äù - why use this word if there is a more familiar and popular ‚Äúfix‚Äù (156 000 against 5 580 in google search, and 228 000 against ~ 1000 in Yandex *)?  Moreover, the Russian "rule" is almost completely analogous to him: to rule - to fix, to rule - to fix, to rule - to fix, etc; <br>  2) "Testing" is beyond my comprehension.  Firstly, there is, again, the more familiar and widespread word ‚Äútest‚Äù (434,000 for google and 547,000 for Yandex versus ~ 2000 for both).  Secondly, there is even more remarkable "test".  Its disadvantage is only in size; <br>  3) ‚ÄúUpdate‚Äù seems to be the most innocuous, however, a foreign gut emerges in the conjugations: ‚Äúupdate‚Äù, ‚Äúupdate‚Äù do not sound our way.  And search engines completely agree with this - ‚Äúupdate‚Äù is unconditionally more popular; <br>  4) ‚ÄúBug‚Äù - a control shot on my small and, I am sure, incomplete list.  The word "bug" successfully entered the Russian language while preserving the masculine category.  Well, what other "bug"?  Because the "error" is feminine?  So this is all IT-jargon, and the "bug" remarkably corresponds to the jargon word "cant". <br><br>  I perfectly understand that it is difficult to impart any norms to IT-jargon.  In general, everyone is free to create their own dialect.  But the open-source rules of fidelity of the majority, such as in openstreetmap tags, would work well here - the rule of tagging that is used more often is considered correct.  Usually it is somehow justified and fixed.  In this case, the frequency indicator is the number of results in the search results.  It is easy and simple to make such a check if there is a doubt as to which word to use.  Of course, someone may not attach particular importance to everything that he hears, but someone, I know, from hearing this off, withers.

      Be literate, friends, and respect each other!  And I wish you less often to hear something like: ‚ÄúFix this bug quicker and proapdeytay, otherwise we cannot test‚Äù. <br><br>  <i>* - Your results may vary from mine.</i>  <i>The exact numbers in this case do not matter, since only the ratio was important.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/254849/">https://habr.com/ru/post/254849/</a></p>
