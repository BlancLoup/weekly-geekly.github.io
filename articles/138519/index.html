  <section class="page js-page"><h1>World of Tanks - something that is usually silent</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> World of Tanks or, for short, WOT is one of the most popular online games of the last year in the CIS.  Go to their website and there you can see the inscription in big letters: play for free.  And, indeed, for registration, client download and online battle with you will not require a penny.  And at first, you will probably even be delighted with such a simple, interesting and free game.  But, as soon as you get involved, then comes the understanding that free cheese is only in a mousetrap.  Who cares - read on about what is usually silent in connection with WOT. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, who knows what WOT - can skip the first couple of paragraphs, for the rest I will explain.  World of Tanks - online, i.e.  You can play only with a permanent Internet connection, the game is an arcade tank simulator.  Developers of the game is positioned as an MMO-action game with elements of role-playing, shooter and strategy.  You need to download and install an online client about 2.6 GB in size, register on the site by entering an email, username and password.  Then, when you start the game client, you must enter the e-mail and password for authorization. <br><br>  It is currently possible to play for five nations: USSR, Germany, France, USA, China.  Moreover, the division into nations refers only to the crews, in combat in one team, participation of tanks of any kind is possible, the division occurs only on the level of tanks, but it will not work to transplant the French crew to a US tank.  Two teams of 15 people each play on one of the cards chosen randomly.  (This all refers to the most common, so-called random mode, there are still clan battles, training mode, etc., but we will not talk about them).  Tanks are divided into classes, at the moment - from 1 to 10. Accordingly, tanks of level 10 are the most powerful.  Beginners are given a default of 4 tanks, one each from the USSR, USA, Germany, France, all level 1.  Choose a tank, press the "To Battle" button - and you are randomly assigned to one or another team.  Teams are formed depending on the level of the tank, beginners of the first level will never have to fight with tanks of the 10th, except for the battle mode in the platoon, but we will not talk about this either.  Management, gameplay - everything is simple to ugliness - perhaps even a young schoolchild can play, which also attracts beginners and attracts a large audience of schoolchildren.  Forward, backward, left, right, shot - this is enough to play.

      Tanks need to "pump".  And here begins the most interesting.  Depending on the outcome of the battle, the tank gets a certain amount of experience and credits.  Credits - game currency.  Accrue experience and credits for various successful actions, but mainly for causing damage to other tanks.  There are two types of experience: personal, for a specific tank and free.  Experience is needed to upgrade the tank ‚Äî installing improved engines, guns, radios, towers, tracks.  The better the components installed on the tank - so he is able to cause more damage to the enemy.  Personal experience of the tank can only be used to study the modules of the tank, free - to study the modules of any tank.  Where does free experience come from?  This is 5% of the "deductions" from the earned experience of each tank, plus you can transfer to a free extra personal tank experience, but ... for money.  No, not for game loans, but for real money.  And here we are approaching the moment that, it turns out, there are certain aspects in the game that push us to pay with real money.  To do this, there is a special currency "gold".  You can buy it only for real money by transferring funds to the account of the company Wargaming.net. <br>  In the game there are two types of game account - "basic" and "premium."  "Premium" can be bought for a specific period - from one day to one year only for gold, i.e.  for real money.  At the moment, one month is worth $ 10 equivalent, since gaming gold is pegged to the dollar. <br>  A ‚Äúpremium‚Äù account gives you an advantage over a ‚Äúbase‚Äù account - you are charged 50% more experience and credits for each battle.  And they are necessary, I remind you, in order to ‚Äúpump over‚Äù tanks gradually from the 1st to, ideally, the 10th level. <br><img src="http://imglink.ru/pictures/20-02-12/d6017d6bc8186380f39da67f55fd4520.jpg"><br>  For credits you buy improved modules for the tank and the tanks themselves, which you explore again for the experience.  Those.  the scheme is as follows: navoyat on the tank the necessary amount of experience, investigated the module - bought for loans, or accumulated experience and credits for the next tank in the hierarchy tree, spent experience and loans, etc.  And again here we meet the pitfalls, which, when playing on the initial tanks, are not shown to us prudently: it‚Äôs necessary to pay for loans to repair a broken tank, unlike the 4 basic ones.  At the beginning, up to the level of 6-7, these are insignificant amounts and the tank, as a rule, pays for itself, especially on a ‚Äúpremium‚Äù account.  In addition, each shell costs a certain amount of credits.  But starting from level 7 for heavy and medium tanks and higher (and the light tank T-50-2 of the fifth level is almost always unprofitable in general), the tank does not always bring credits more than necessary for repairs and ammunition, especially if This is a ‚Äúbasic‚Äù account.  And if you also got into an ally, then they will remove a part of both credits and experience.  Not enough credit for the maintenance of the tank or the purchase of a new one?  No problem!  Exchange gold for loans at a fixed rate, i.e.  buy for real money.  I will not bother with calculations, I will only say that a tank of the 7th level of the IS in terms of dollars will cost 14.5 green.  And, by the way, to upgrade to level 7, it will take you about three months if you are a born tanker, or even more.  This, of course, if you do not spend 12 hours a day in the game, and reasonably spend an hour or two on the game every day. <br><br>  By the way, the tanks are stored in the hangars.  Each tank needs a separate hangar.  By default, 5 hangars are given, you can buy additional ones only for gold, again - for real money.  Each hangar will cost you $ 1.2.  That is, if you want to collect a collection of tanks - pay.  Farther. <br>  There are so-called premium tanks, which can only be bought for gold.  The beauty is that there is no need to explore them, and they bring more experience and credit than a regular tank.  And for them, depending on their level, there are restrictions on the level of the opponent, they are often thrown ‚Äúto the top‚Äù, i.e.  they are the coolest on the map and, accordingly, the chance of winning is greater.  For example, a premium tank of the 8th level KV-5 costs $ 30.  There is money and you do not want to be pumped for months to level 8?  No problem!  Give 30 dollars and ride among the "cool"!  By the way, I tell you, really interesting battles are conducted precisely among tanks of 7-10 levels.  There is no money or you do not want to pay - then your path is long and thorny from kids, through schoolchildren, ‚Äúto the stars‚Äù. <br><img src="http://imglink.ru/pictures/20-02-12/9f831a8fb1f0c7c1bae18b56df55c48e.jpg"><br>  Suppose you spent half a year and got to the 8th level yourself, without a premium account, saved up for a long time and bought, for example, the IS-3.  Steep tank of 8th level.  In the "top", i.e.  the most advanced version, in the capable hands of the IS-3, is a formidable opponent even for tanks of 9-10 levels.  Only here not all hands are skillful and the fights are folded differently.  And not always repair + ammunition will be cheaper than the tank earned for the battle.  Quit so not to pay in gold?  There is a solution: to ride on medium tanks of 6-7 levels, they, as correctly profitable, and in a successful battle are well profitable.  So it turns out that when you got to the top, you either pay real money, or from time to time you go to the middle classes anyway to feed the tanks of the upper classes.  (If you are in a clan, then the situation is somewhat different there, but we agreed to consider only regular battles.) Here is a real example on the ‚Äúbasic‚Äù account for a level 7 IS tank: <br><br>  Defeat <br>  Combat: Mines February 11, 2012 14:58:07 <br>  Tank: IC <br>  Experience gained: 117 <br>  Credits received: 3,723 <br>  Repairs: <br>  Repair of tank IS completed successfully.  Credits spent: 7,319 <br>  Purchased: <br>  Ammunition on the tank IC successfully replenished.  Credits spent: 756 <br><br>  With a premium, there would be 5585 income credits.  And this is with a DT-10T gun which has relatively cheap projectiles.  For a 122 mm gun, only one armor-piercing shell costs more than 1000 credits and 10 shots per battle will give more than 10,000 loss credits. <br> <a href="http://imglink.ru/"><img src="http://imglink.ru/pictures/20-02-12/034ba5b5f992eaa8d591a1f82b36f18a.jpg"></a> <br>  For guns, there are three types of ammunition: armor-piercing, high-explosive and cumulative.  The first and second are bought for loans, cumulative - only for gold.  And the latter have the largest armor penetration.  There is even the expression ‚Äúshoot gold‚Äù in the game.  Again: do you want to inflict more damage to the enemy, even to someone who is above your level?  - shell out.  At 1 dollar on average, you can buy 25 shots of cumulative shells. <br><img src="http://imglink.ru/pictures/20-02-12/f86d6634666f7b09c835d5cc57046036.jpg"><br>  Few people are interested in playing on entry-level tanks, so various bots were written by smart people, allowing them to ‚Äúpump‚Äù tanks without user intervention.  But Wargaming.net is struggling with such users, having caught - the account should be blocked and it doesn‚Äôt matter how much money you put into the game.  IMHO, in itself, the tracking of such accounts - brute force. <br><br>  Further, according to the user agreement, it is forbidden to transfer your account to other people, respectively, resale of accounts is prohibited.  Have a conscience: you earn, give and earn money to someone.  Yes, I know what ‚Äúexcuse‚Äù - resale is one of the methods of fraud.  But let's not prevaricate - the main task of Wargaming.net in this case is to take care of its income, and only then, perhaps, about the users.  Want to avoid fraud - create an exchange of accounts.  No‚Ä¶ <br>  Go ahead.  Few people know that you can simply be trivially substitute.  There is a possibility, knowing the player's e-mail, to send him a certain amount of gold.  Send him the amount, he spends the gold, and then revoke your payment (there are such types of payment).  The player has a negative balance of funds and his account is blocked.  And not the fact that then proves that not a camel.  Yes, tell me, you need to monitor your account.  But those who are often replenished by friends, relatives or himself - may not attach importance to the next ‚Äúinfusion‚Äù.  And we all know that not everyone is attentive, especially in games. <br><br>  The text comes out to be voluminous, probably, it‚Äôs necessary to wrap it up, although I didn‚Äôt mention all aspects of ‚Äúfree‚Äù WOT.  For those that read, summarize. <br><br>  So, formally, the game is free.  But for the extra charms you need to pay real money.  And this is not talked about, but rather, they are silent at the initial stage of the game.  When you spend a lot of time and effort to get to the top, it suddenly turns out that playing on a ‚Äúbasic‚Äù account is not so pleasant, especially if you have ever tried ‚Äúpremium‚Äù.  And at first, the game delays its simplicity, gratuity, gaming capabilities.  The approach of Wargaming.net is like spreading you know what, when the first or second dose is ‚Äúcompletely free‚Äù, but then ... <br><br>  Everything in the game is set up in such a way that you can play without paying, but at every step you openly hint: pay and you will get even more pleasure.  And their strategy, I tell you, is quite justified.  More than a million players are playing, and if everyone spends at least a dollar a month ... So much for ‚Äúabsolutely free.‚Äù  No, of course, no one forces you to pay, but many are drawn in, some simply have a gambling addiction, others do not care where to spend the extra 10-20 dollars a month, and the third just feel sorry for throwing after hundreds of hours of pumping.  As a result, the "free" game turns into fixed costs.  And these expenses are more in perspective than that of Starcraft II, especially if you immediately buy a permanent license for the latter, but more than 1000 rubles at a time scare many.  But Blizzard honestly from the very beginning says: the game is paid. <br><br>  Whether this approach is correct Wargaming.net - everyone decides in his own way.  But, as for me, there is little honesty in it.  The main task is to lure the network and "cut down bablosika."  And how I want to, in this world, not those who only think how to earn money from you, but how, first of all, to give you something, without demanding anything in return and not holding a hook under the bait ... <br>  Those.  what we have: a competent, very competent business project, no more. <br><br>  PS <br>  Well, it is necessary to maintain a server for something, pay tech support, programmers, etc.?  - you ask.  I must answer.  But the money for this can be earned by advertising or by sponsoring the very same Gazprom.  Weak?  Call yourself "Zenith" :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/138519/">https://habr.com/ru/post/138519/</a></p>
