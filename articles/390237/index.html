I planned to test for 10-15 lamps per month, but it turned out quite differently.  Already 557 lamps have been tested (17 of them are fluorescent, 59 are incandescent, all the others are LED).  We managed to test such a large number of lamps thanks to successful popular fundraising (crowdfunding), which continues today. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/958/b0c/9d5/958b0c9d5df01bffd65e8d880ab19e7b.png"><br><br>  Today I will tell you why I started this project, what will happen with it further and ask you to answer questions, the answers to which will help determine how the project will develop.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  When I first encountered household LED lamps, I realized that they are not all good.  I, like many, thought then that in Chinese online stores, light bulbs are the same as they are sold in Russia, only cheaper.  After several orders, I began to understand: something is wrong here.  Chinese light bulbs unpleasantly flickered, gave a nasty greenish light and shone much dimmer than promised.  Then, I still did not know that the ripple of light from LED lamps depends on the electronic board driver hidden in the lamp base, the quality of light is largely determined by the color rendering index (CRI), which is very low in most lamps from Chinese online stores, but with real power and the brightness of the Chinese sellers can lie and two or three times. <br><br>  I began to look for information about the real parameters of LED lamps, but it was very little on the Internet: in order to measure the parameters of light, you need professional and very expensive equipment, which is only available in certified laboratories, and they have no right to share the results of their tests. <br><br>  Fortunately, in early 2014, fate brought me together with a company that had a device for testing the parameters of Viso LightSpion lamps.  The device they bought at the lighting exhibition in Singapore and in Russia, he seems to be the only one.  We discussed with the owners of the device how it would be great to start testing all the lamps that are sold and publish these honest results.  They offered to come to them once a month and test the light bulbs, which I started to do since February 2014.  At first, all the data was simply recorded in an Excel spreadsheet.  Then we started to think that it would be great to make a website with convenient filters for viewing results. <br><br>  A wonderful programmer from Nizhny Novgorod Sergey Andreev responded to my call for help, creating a fast, beautiful and user-friendly website LampTest.ru, which was launched on June 24, 2015. <br><br>  The device measured all the parameters of the lamp except one - the pulsation of light.  Fortunately, the developers of the domestic device Lupine provided our project with their device. <br><br>  Most recently, Andrey Karasyov joined the project team, which helps to process the results and bring them into the database. <br><br>  So, today tested 557 lamps.  I wanted to make an anniversary post after a five-hundredth bulb, but it didn't work out.  :) I have tested 56 LED brand lamps, and 30 brands of lamps have been tested for at least 5 types.  These brands are: artpole, ASD, Camelion, Diall, Ecola, Gauss, IEK, IKEA, Jazzway, Kreonix, Lexman, Madix, Navigator, OSRAM, Philips, REV, Robiton, Smartbuy, Supra, Thomson, Uniel, Wolta, X- Flash, Cosmos, Lisma, Nanosvet, Onlayt, Start, Housekeeper, Era. <br><br>  What next? <br><br>  Alas, it may happen that soon I will not be able to use Viso LightSpion, so now I try to test as many lamps as possible of the maximum number of brands.  I do not want to guess what will happen when I lose access to the device, I hope there will be a way out. <br><br>  I created project groups on Facebook <a href="">www.facebook.com/lamptest.ru</a> and VKontakte <a href="https://vk.com/lamptest">vk.com/lamptest</a> .  In groups I will talk about all the news of the project - what I am testing, what changes are taking place on the site, what interesting things have been found and many more interesting little things that go beyond the large articles on the blog.  Add in the social network where you prefer. <br><br>  I tried to test mainly the lamps with ‚Äúwarm‚Äù light of 2700-3000K, because I think that such light is more suitable for home.  I think it makes no sense to test low-power lamps.  It seems to me that it makes sense to test ordinary pear lamps for an E27 base with an equivalent of at least 60 watts, ‚Äúcandles‚Äù and ‚Äúballs‚Äù with an equivalent of at least 40 watts, and spotlights with an equivalent of at least 35 watts. <br><br>  Today I want to ask you which lamps you are interested in, in order to understand which lamps to buy for testing in the first place.  Please respond to polls at the end of this post. <br><br>  My second question is about brands.  In my immediate plans Comtech, Housekeeper and Tomic Lamp.  What other brands does it make sense to test? <br><br>  And of course, I accept all the wishes of the site.  I will immediately say that in the near future the overall rating system of the lamps will change, the equivalent of power will be more accurately considered and three new parameters will be added - R9, Power Factor and the warranty period of the lamp. <br><br>  I think I did not answer the main question: why do I do all this?  It's simple: I realized that with this project I can benefit a lot of people, and to benefit people is perhaps the main goal of my life.  Yes, I do not earn anything from it, well, I‚Äôm such a crazy enthusiast.  Money can not buy happiness.  :) <br><br>  ps By the way, if there are more enthusiasts who want to help the project, write.  There is work for everyone. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/390237/">https://habr.com/ru/post/390237/</a></p>
