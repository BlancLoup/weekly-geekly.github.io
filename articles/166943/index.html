  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Dell Latitude 10: Tablet Replacing Laptop</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> The story of the tablet computer Dell Latitude 10 should start with the history of its purchase.  In early December, I flew to Austin, Texas at Dell World.  This is such a great annual event, where Michael Dell performs with colleagues, as well as friendly celebrities.  In 2012, Bill Clinton (the same one) and the Linkin Park band, with many well-known Mike Shinoda, demonstrated how he mixes songs right on the touch screen of the Dell all-in-one. <br><br>  During the break, a young man approached me and turned out to be a reader with my considerable experience.  He used to live in Turkmenistan, and now in Austin.  He works at Dell, he misses his home, but he does not tear back.  After discussing the subtleties of writing interesting articles, the young man winked conspiratorially and offered to buy the newest 10-inch tablet.  Say, only 10 copies were allocated to all delegates, six have already dispersed, but one of the remaining four may be mine.  Issue price - $ 650.  At first, I confess, I took the offer with restraint.  After all, a tablet on Windows 8 ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/158613/">well, on RT</a> ) was already in the arsenal.  And although the Latitude 10 looked very nice, I didn‚Äôt want to spend money on one more ... All decided to visit the Dell site, where under the description of this model was: ‚ÄúEstimated delivery date - January 19, 2013‚Äù ‚Äã‚Äã(remember, the first decade of December was on the calendar).  To be one of the first owners of the device in the world and certainly the first in Russia?  What can be doubts, I take! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0a7/d49/f4f/0a7d49f4f2c776ee123d86fedab6947c.jpg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a>

      They wrote me in a plump notebook and promised to send an SMS when the tablets were brought to Austin.  And indeed a day later, in one of the Austin Convention Center centers, a branch of the Office Depot network opened for a short time, where I was sold a huge box.  Aside from the jokes - she was really huge by today's standards.  Previously, these were in video recorders.  Opening the box showed that I was lucky: a docking station and a branded case were put in the load on the tablet itself.  Both were packed in separate boxes made of brown cardboard, but even so, there was plenty of free space inside.  It was filled with cellophane blisters.  Against the background of the iPad mini tablet purchased for one of the colleagues, this whole ‚Äúcomposition‚Äù looked pretty monstrous.  But if you have ever bought a ThinkPad series of laptops, the box with the Latitude 10 will not scare, because it looks like two drops of water used by IBM / Lenovo.  There is nothing surprising in this: the tablet is designed for the business audience, and it will never show off on the shelves of ordinary stores.  But from the point of view of practicality and safety of the contents - the option is sensible. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/972/b04/652/972b04652345120f904d58ff579e6287.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>First meeting</i> <br><br>  After returning home, I wrote in a blog that I had acquired an interesting piece of iron, I was studying, I would soon sit down for a review.  And here an amazing thing happened.  It turns out that in the world at that time there were quite a few people who placed an order for the Latitude 10, but had not yet received their own copy.  My post was immediately translated into English, published in some forum and the citizens went to the blog with questions from the series ‚ÄúWell, what?  Well, how?  Like?  Is it hot? ‚ÄùEtc.  One Russian-speaking citizen even sent a detailed list of tests, which, in his opinion, I was obliged to immediately run on the tablet and report on the results. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/050/8d0/261/0508d0261f69beef0f01182412036723.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Official Latitude 10 Portrait</i> <br><br>  Due to the high workload at work and the habit of studying the experimental technique deep enough, I sat down for a review only a month after the purchase.  During this time, I managed to settle down properly, install the familiar set of software and bring the tablet to the master Levchenko for analysis.  And now, I hope, I can tell you something really useful. <br><br>  <i><b>On a surface</b></i> <br><br>  For a start - about the iron component.  The screen diagonal of the Dell Latitude 10 is 10 inches with a resolution of 1366x768 pixels.  An IPS type matrix was used, so the richness of the colors is excellent and the viewing angles are my homage.  On top, the screen is protected by Gorilla Glass aluminosilicate glass.  As a user, I am extremely pleased with the quality of the picture.  But a stern businessman carrying with him a lot of corporate secrets, wide-angle reviews can do a disservice.  Therefore, the mothers of paranoid should attend to the label of a special film that protects the screen from prying eyes.  The benefit of such films are inexpensive and available everywhere. <br><br>  The screen, of course, touch.  At the same time, ten finger presses are recognized.  There is support for the Wacom pen, but I haven‚Äôt had one in the collection, so I haven‚Äôt been able to verify this important functionality for many in the business.  Those interested can buy a stylus for $ 49 and try. <br><br>  The system works on the Intel Atom Z2760 processor with a peak frequency of 1.8 GHz.  This is the only (so far) Intel chip made specifically for tablet computers.  Two cores, four threads (thanks to Hyper-Threading), a second-level cache size of 1 megabyte, 64-bit instructions are not supported.  The amount of RAM is limited to 2 gigabytes, and it can work in dual channel mode.  The graphics core operates at a frequency of 533 MHz, and the entire chip is made using 32-nanometer technology.  The value of TDP is not reported, but, running a little ahead, I will say that it is very small. <br><br>  The onboard flash memory is 64 GB.  Unfortunately, 128-gigabyte and more versions of the Latitude 10 are not yet released, and the memory is one Sandisk chip soldered on the board, so the upgrade cannot be done.  This is partially compensated by the presence of a full-size SDXC card slot in the tablet, thanks to which the onboard memory can be doubled easily and inexpensively (remember, the 64 GB SD card now costs from 2000 rubles). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1b0/2a7/589/1b02a7589832809c86b892558c7aaab8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We list and other useful holes.  On the right, our hero has a full-sized USB 2.0 port to which you can connect anything you want - an external drive, printer, hub, keyboard, mouse, etc.  You can also recharge smaller mobile devices from it.  Next door is a mini-HDMI port.  For what it is necessary I will not specify. <br><br>  Below is a proprietary socket for the charger and the docking station.  Next to it, there is still a micro-USB port, but what it is for is not very clear.  The site says that ‚Äúfor charging,‚Äù but no matter how much I connected the chargers to it, the desired effect could not be achieved.  The tablet says that the connection sees, but does not want to charge.  Perhaps you need a more powerful source, but I can only offer a charger from the iPad 4 generation (12 watts). <br><br>  The Latitude case is made of magnesium alloy with a soft touch soft touch.  Weight with a standard battery is 658 grams (for the 4th generation iPad, let me remind you, 652 grams).  It is convenient to hold the tablet in your hands with one or both hands, and you don‚Äôt want to release it in the corporate case once again.  Seriously, a very good case turned out.  Dell does not recognize who its manufacturer is, but indirectly it is Belkin.  I apologize that I mention some kind of case on such a serious resource, but, apart from the jokes, it is almost impossible to use it without modern tablet PCs.  And the right case adds +25 to karma and usability. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/adb/459/608/adb4596089d3cc2b50edeecfa2d690cf.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>The main beauty of the tablet on Windows 8 is the ability to connect anything from the periphery to it.</i>  <i>In this case, he earned a great job with a keyboard from an ancient iMac and quite a rootless mouse.</i> <br><br>  The tablet works on a full-fledged, uncropped Windows 8 operating system. The default is ‚Äújust eight,‚Äù but my reader said that there is the possibility of a free upgrade to the Professional version.  However, when you try to ‚Äúget access to additional functions‚Äù, through the Control Panel, you are offered to add 2190 rubles to the cashier first.  Probably, you can get an upgrade by contacting the Dell support service, so far I do not see any valid reason to bother with this.  I personally on the tablet and without Professional well. <br><br>  Although - as well?  Everything that I wrote <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/158613/">about Windows RT</a> is easily transferred to the full version.  Two interfaces, weakly glued together;  the inability to manage a computer with your finger in Desktop mode is all there is.  But there is no problem with the software.  Launch everything your heart desires.  You can also install drivers, so I was finally able to set up my home Xerox printer on the tablet.  Of course, on my large computers I left the ‚Äúseven‚Äù and I'm not going anywhere from it yet.  But on the tablet it is unsuitable for use, which means it will have to get used to Windows 8. It‚Äôs already almost used to me - like a dog getting used to its fleas.  But I still think that Microsoft didn‚Äôt specifically finish a good idea. <br><br>  Now that we have walked through the exterior, it's time to look inside. <br><br>  <b><i>What are the tablets made of?</i></b> <br><br>  The first thing that pleasantly surprises is the removable battery.  We are even less likely to indulge us in laptops with ultrabooks, and in the tablet I see them for the first time.  The default battery comes with a capacity of 30 Wh, but you can buy twice as capacious.  True, I personally will not do this, because even from a standard tablet in read mode and with background synchronization over WiFi (mail, social networks) it works exactly 10 hours.  In the Battery Eater test (Classic mode), where the rendered battery in OpenGL constantly rotates on the screen, the operating time was 5 hours and 42 minutes.  It is worth clarifying that in both cases the setting was turned off when the 15% charge level was reached, so if necessary you can squeeze out from forty more minutes to an hour or more. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/549/d65/458/549d65458c1150b051aa750c9d3fa934.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In my usual ‚Äútablet‚Äù mode, when it is used for an hour and a half in the evenings, I charged Latitude once a week.  Just like an iPad.  Inside, by the way, is not ARM, which is considered the benchmark of energy efficiency, but the ‚Äúhorribly voracious‚Äù x86 architecture with large real Windows.  I do not know about you, but after these measurements, the template broke into small pieces.  By the way, the Standby mode of the Atom Z2760 is about the same as that of the future Haswell processors: it sleeps, it sleeps, but it performs basic tasks, like checking mail and receiving messages in the built-in Windows 8 messenger. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4bc/aaa/da7/4bcaaada75f1cf14e0c18324dbb71d6d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Under the battery hides data on energy consumption, country of manufacture (China, of course) and even the Rostest badge.  The back cover is mounted on two bolts, but to remove it, you need to cope with a few tricky snaps.  However, an experienced master coped with them without difficulty. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/185/961/4a3/1859614a3249c27aa149c4ae49f019d9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As usual, the electronic part occupies a very small part of the internal space of the tablet.  I had to look inside tablets on the previous generation Intel Atom before, but their motherboards were more like netbook ones.  The same components, the same fans.  The Dell Latitude 10 electronics layout is completely ‚Äútablet‚Äù.  Perhaps the board lacks the finesse peculiar to counterparts in Apple tablets, but compared to previous incarnations of Atom tablets, this is a giant step forward. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/adc/836/f28/adc836f2860804aa0ea15d4822134909.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>All electronic filling tablet.</i>  <i>Below are two cameras - the main (8 megapixels) and front (two megapixels).</i>  <i>The main one with good lighting shoots very well, no worse than the new iPad.</i>  <i>The front one starts to ‚Äúmake noise‚Äù even in a fairly bright room, but is quite suitable for communication via Skype.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/98d/d29/d9e/98dd29d9e747757231d599bcee4565bf.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Main board with screens removed</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4e1/810/470/4e18104708a7d53c37baeae9d5c154db.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>She's the back view.</i> <br><br>  In the photo, the board may seem rather large, and to understand its true size, look at how huge the SD card slot seems to be. <br><br>  Remove the protective screens, look for the processor ... and do not find it.  How so?  Where did he go? <br><br>  Unfortunately, we can not admire him.  Intel Atom Z2760 is so small and emits so little heat that the board developers decided to resort to a two-layer design.  Look closely at this photograph taken through the eyepiece of the microscope. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/edf/fc8/f6f/edffc8f6f4a9a2f56e5e558b94cccc06.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Before us is the Samsung K3PE0E000A-XGC2 - a dual-channel 16-gigabit (or 2-gigabyte) LPDDR2 module (by the way, it is also used in the American version of the Samsung Galaxy III smartphone running on a Qualcomm chip).  Considered?  See on the left CPU1?  So the processor is hidden under the memory module. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/27b/619/efb/27b619efb3918ab2d3ecc2de092aa34f.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>The salad-colored edge at the bottom is the edge of the Atom board</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7fb/39f/954/7fb39f9544847c1373a17984b91d574f.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>In this picture you can see that the design is not even double-layered, but three-layered - there was a place between the processor and the memory chip.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/628/44b/584/62844b5848964787cdf37af39c3be995.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>SD card seems gigantic</i> <br><br>  Interesting, right?  I used to see this only in mobile phones and smartphones, where engineers go for a variety of tricks to save space.  I don‚Äôt know if it was so critical to save it in this case, but the fact that a 2-core processor with x86 architecture can not only not be supplied with a radiator, but also be unsoldered under the RAM module, it was not without difficulty in my head.  He really doesn‚Äôt need cooling: the system withstood a long time at 100% load without sticking, and the back cover remained slightly warm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/24f/311/eca/24f311ecaaa4bc74c9deb4da74f851d3.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Hi, Mitsumi!</i> <br><br>  We have already talked about the 64-gigabyte Sandisk module, but the integrated Wi-Fi and Bluetooth controller gave a little surprise.  Probably many experienced programmers remember the excellent and very inexpensive Mitsumi mice and keyboards.  They lived for a long time and worked no worse than much more expensive counterparts.  Then this company also produced quite good optical drives, which, however, gained somewhat less popularity.  For the past six years, I haven‚Äôt encountered any Mitsumi products at all, and I really thought that the brand remained in the times when computers were large.  But no!  The miniature controller in Dell Latitude 10 is made by Mitsumi and works very well.  Supported standards are Wi-Fi IEE802.11abgn and Bluetooth 4.0. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/85a/9a5/dd1/85a9a5dd16915c847e07443e0590a2c8.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>There could be 3G</i> <br><br>  My copy of the tablet is not trained to work with 3G, but if you want, you can purchase the version with the corresponding module, which in the States will cost $ 100 more.  A place is provided for it, but, alas, an independent upgrade is not possible.  If you really want to, you can insert a regular USB-modem, since the supply of energy is quite large.  And here you want 3G, you want LTE - who needs what. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8b5/5de/0bb/8b55de0bb3a7b3bff1fbb791547b72ab.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The fee for servicing the proprietary interface connector looks rather complicated, but there is a reason for this.  The fact is that when connected to the docking station, we already have four USB 2.0 ports (3.0 processor does not support), full-size HDMI and even Ethernet.  It is assumed that you use the tablet as the main working computer by connecting a monitor to the docking station, an external hard drive, a keyboard with a mouse, and when you need to, take it with you and go on a business trip or just to meet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/af6/1bd/756/af61bd75697885ee54cd3f2aa1083ca8.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>After removing all the electronics, we stopped.</i>  <i>From the inside, the screen is mounted on plastic rivets and, in order to gain access to it, it would seem necessary to remove the glass under heating.</i>  <i>Risk health tablet did not</i> <br><br>  Docking stations can be two things - one in the office, the other at home.  But is there enough performance margin for such a pretty usage model?  With this, I tried to figure it out, for a week I got used to the role of an advanced businessman. <br><br>  <i><b>Theory is faced with practice</b></i> <br><br>  The Windows performance index immediately tells us that the system can compete with laptops on the Core 2 Duo.  The lowest figure in the game graphics - well, there is nothing surprising.  Modern 3D games on the tablet are really better not to run, but a classic, like Max Payne 2, just flies.  Also, there are no problems with games from the Windows Market, since they are pretty simple. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4b3/556/e1c/4b3556e1c15948f4bad06af51ff396b7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A little surprised by the high score of the built-in drive.  According to the Speed ‚Äã‚ÄãTest Pro benchmark, its maximum read speed is quite decent 77 MB / s, but the records are only 27.5 MB / s.  By mobile standards, this, of course, is not bad, but by computer - so-so.  And we remind you, we are trying to use Latitude 10 precisely as a Computer for a Business Man, as it was intended. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4d7/d4d/122/4d7d4d1228859a07b597e846871d9126.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Tablet in the dock.</i>  <i>Front one USB port and headphone jack.</i>  <i>Everything else is on the back side</i> <br><br>  The tablet works seamlessly with the Philips FullHD monitor.  Also, there was no trouble with a Logitech Bluetooth mouse and a wired keyboard of the same brand.  By the way, during disassembly, we connected a keyboard from an ancient Mac to Latitude 10, and through a USB hub built into it, also a wireless mouse.  And nothing worked fine. <br><br>  A normal person is not surprised by this, but I‚Äôm happy, like a child, after exploring the Microsoft Surface compatibility of a tablet with any equipment.  He survived a very strong moral trauma when a card reader did not work with Surface ... <br><br>  The maintenance of the Microsoft Office 2010 package of the dual-core Atom's power is enough with a margin.  Opened 100-megabyte presentations with quite complex animation, wrote texts, rules, journal estimates in Excel.  It feels like something like on my past laptop with a Core 2 Duo T6500 (2.1 GHz frequency).  That is quite fast. <br><br>  In the background, windows with Facebook, Twitter, Lenta.ru (before redesign) and a couple of random sites were constantly open.  At first, they do not deliver troubles, but, as we know, social networking pages are in the habit of slowly eating up memory until they take up all the available volume.  So, Facebook in IE easily reached 700 MB, after which it became difficult to work and it was necessary to reload the page.  However, this is not the fault of the tablet, but of wonderful programmers with cheerful accents. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d22/1fc/cb1/d221fccb1b903ee6597a433ac498f5c1.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>This is not a boomerang.</i>  <i>This is the speaker system of the tablet.</i>  <i>By the way, pretty decent</i> <br><br>  When traveling, I always process photos, transferring them from RAW to JPEG and subjecting them to various manipulations in Photoshop.  To test the tablet in this incarnation, put a trial version of Photoshop CS6 and opened several 20-megabyte RAW, made by camera Sony Cyber-shot RX100.  The photos opened in the converter just surprisingly cheerfully, the difference with the ultrabook on the Core i5 manifested itself only when you later opened the picture in Photoshop itself (perhaps, the low write speed on the built-in flash drive, where the Adobe child immediately discards the copy, had an effect).   ,      Smart Sharpen,      . <br><br>  ,      FullHD-,   . ,   ,   720p   .    : , , ,      .    . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/242/a2d/df5/242a2ddf54293af434ca016966d8b49a.jpg" alt="image"><br> <i> BIOS    ,   . ,     ‚Äì  </i> <br><br>  , -,   ,  ‚Ä¶          . ,      ? <br><br>  Yes and no.
