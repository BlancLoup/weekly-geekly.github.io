  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Testing Conference Heisenbag: Video recordings of reports-2016 and work on the bugs in 2017</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Looking at how the conferences for testers look like, we were surprised: on each of them technological issues faded into the background, and the main focus was on test management and software quality.  These conferences solved the problems of PMs and CTO, and not developers and testers-automators.  Is it bad?  Of course not.  Suum cuique, as they say. <br><br>  However, doing the first Heisenbag in Moscow last year, we decided to correct the situation and make it the first purely technical conference for all those who practice testing: it‚Äôs not just testers, but also most developers (who care will be with their code).  Having scored some bumps on the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/jugru/blog/317938/">first attempt</a> , we took into account the experience gained, and <b>on June 4, we</b> are ready to do a deep dive in testing technology for the <b>Heisenbag 2017 Piter</b> . <br><br>  In the meantime, we share all the video recordings of the reports of the last conference and tell in detail what to expect from the next one.

With all due respect to the knowledge and experience of Rex, the reports were not very relevant and rather superficial.  It was after this incident that we decided not to miss <b>a single report</b> without test runs and rehearsals, regardless of the status of the speakers. <br><br>  And yes, despite the fact that Rex wanted to speak in St. Petersburg, this time he will not.  Just like many other speakers who did not reach the rating for a passing score. <br><br>  The good news is that the program is already 60% ready, and we have the time and opportunity to look for technically complex, interesting and unusual performances.  We will choose with passion.  In addition, at the request of participants, we screwed an <b>indication of hardcore</b> to each of the reports - so now you will know exactly what to expect when going to the next report. <br><br><h2>  <b>Video recordings Heisenbag 2016 Moscow</b> </h2><br>  Since three months have already passed since the last conference, we have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX6fjZa167tSy_4ryTLcOBw/videos"><b>opened access to videos of all the reports of the</b></a> previous conference.  There you will find everything that happened in December: reports on test automation, load testing and integration testing, and much more. <br><br> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX6fjZa167tSy_4ryTLcOBw/videos"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/261/2c2/c6e/2612c2c6e7ee4eb596a38976a376b113.png"></a> <br><br>  In the next post I will review the best reports of the last conference, so if there is no time to watch everything, it makes sense to subscribe to our blog (or any of the social networks) and wait for the list of the best. <br><br><h2>  <b>Heisenbag 2017 Piter Reports</b> </h2><br>  In the meantime, the rating is not ready, you can evaluate how those speakers spoke, whom we have already invited to the next event with new reports.  For convenience, I tried to break the reports by topic: <br><br><h3>  <b>Approaches and Patterns</b> </h3><br><img width="180" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/667/534/d1c/667534d1ca0d4280a1fd2e54a3279fcc.jpg">  <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/talks/improving-autotests-a-black-magic-performance/"><b>Alexey Vinogradov / Radio QA - Improving Autotests: a session of black magic</b></a> <br><br>  A report from the developer of the Selenide framework and the founder of the Radio QA podcast on how to do the right UI autotests.  Which techniques should be used by a professional developer, and which ones should be avoided?  Where is the pain in modern automated testing?  Everything will start with a simple code and consistently go to using popular design patterns, such as: PageFactory, LoadableComponents, Single Responsibility Principle and others. <br><br><img width="180" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/423/2dd/27b/4232dd27b4524353a4070cdb5235fcdb.jpeg">  <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/talks/testing-in-data-world/"><b>Igor Khrol / Toptal - Testing in the data world</b></a> <br><br>  The management of the companies tries to make decisions not on a whim, but on the basis of numbers and objective data.  How to test the software that counts these numbers?  If the code, after processing the company's data for the year, shows 42% - is this the correct answer, or is there an error, and we should have received 43%?  Based on the practices developed by Toptal‚Äôs analytics department, I would like to answer these questions.  BI, ETL, DWH, ML ... If you know what these abbreviations mean, this report is for you. <br><br><img width="180" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/466/b46/5bb/466b465bb3d5451c82ed8cbc0daf8906.jpg">  <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/talks/finding-the-best-way-to-test-your-system"><b>Jan Jaap Cannegieter / Squerist - Finding the best way to test your system</b></a> <br><br>  You can test differently, the truth is that most testers do not know about all approaches, using familiar methods even where they are not very suitable. <br><br>  In this report, you will learn the difference between scripting and research testing, which testing methods are hidden under each of the approaches and in what situations they should be used, as well as how it all relates to test automation. <br><br>  The second, practical part of the report will be devoted to creating a checklist that will allow you to choose the right tool or approach to your project. <br><br><h3>  <b>Frameworks and tools</b> </h3><br><br><img width="180" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/43e/094/133/43e094133a5949e19c5eb1a759e87476.jpeg">  <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/talks/allure-framework/"><b>Artem Eroshenko - Allure Framework</b></a> <br><br>  Allure Framework is a popular autotest report tool that simplifies their analysis.  In the report, Artem will tell about his new version of Allure 2. A lot of new things have appeared in it: the environment, the restarts and the history of the test, the display of fixtures, the categories of errors and much more.  One of the key features is the ability to customize Allure for yourself using a plugin system. <br><br><img width="180" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a6d/752/a3e/a6d752a3ec484c6ea35d21968c2dc659.jpg">  <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/talks/appium-automation-for-apps"><b>Dan Cuellar - Appium: Automation for Apps</b></a> <br><br>  A report from the developer Appium framework, recently included in the JS Foundation, is a cross-platform open source tool for writing UI autotests for Android and iOS.  After a brief introduction to the philosophy and principles of Appium, Dan will show you how to write Appium scripts using WebDriver in your favorite language. <br><br>  Here it should be noted that Dan is preparing something new: he will show the use of Appium for desktop applications.  The report is still in preparation, as is the solution in the prototype stage.  We crossed our fingers for Den to do it all, and he showed an exclusive report.  So it will be useful to you, even if you are not a mobile tester. <br><br><img width="180" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0cc/0af/dd9/0cc0afdd98b04fc8bbbb3f3bd4928629.jpg" alt="image">  <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/talks/load-testing-a-web-service/"><b>Alexey Lavrenyuk / Yandex - Load testing a web-service</b></a> <br><br>  We are shooting at the Python Tornado demo web service, which is specially written to show performance problems.  I will show how resource leakage reports, heavy cron jobs, bad algorithms and heavy database queries appear in the load test reports.  We will draw conclusions, correct bottlenecks and compare the performance of the service "before" and "after." <br><br><h3>  <b>Testing deep dive</b> </h3><br><br>  Although many of the above reports are technologically advanced and professional-oriented, we have a whole block of reports that will be full of technical results and will require not only experience, but also love to dig deeper into the guts of your favorite technologies or your own product.  So far we have two such, but there will be more (we are currently recruiting to the program for technically complex reports): <br><br><img width="180" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ba3/68e/129/ba368e1290af42d08aab671102a9ac73.jpg">  <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/talks/webdriver-testing-in-javascript/"><b>Ilya Korobitsin / Grid Dynamics - WebDriver-tests for JavaScript</b></a> <br><br>  For most end-to-end tests in the browser, Selenium WebDriver is used, clients to which are available in many languages.  The report will reveal the experience of writing such tests in JavaScript and dealt with what features of the language had to face in the process.  Protractor, a framework that simplifies the testing of applications written using AngularJS, will also be reviewed. <br><br><img width="180" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f27/cbe/ed5/f27cbeed549049d8b5eaa4fded0b6807.jpg">  <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/talks/wash-your-hands-before-eating-or-sanitizer-in-testing/"><b>Andrey Satarin / Yandex - Wash your hands before eating or sanitizer in testing</b></a> <br><br>  As one hero said, ‚Äúgreat responsibility comes and great responsibility‚Äù.  C ++ is a language with great expressive power and enormous possibilities.  But these opportunities have to be paid for with potential defects that are absent in programs in managed languages. <br><br>  This report will discuss sanitizers - great tools that allow you to find complex defects in C ++ programs.  Andrei will talk about these tools, their capabilities and how to use them for the benefit of your project. <br><br><img width="180" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/33e/ea6/033/33eea60333cc47389da72ba312eb731e.jpg">  And finally, the <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/talks/think-bigger-how-to-truly-become-world-class-in-testing/"><b>report from Ilari Henrik Aegerter</b></a> , which did not fall into any of the categories, since it is dedicated to how you personally, as a tester / developer, become better, more professional and ‚Äúhighly paid‚Äù. <br><br>  In the report you will receive a list of specific steps that can be taken immediately after the conference in order to develop in the right direction.  All recommendations will be illustrated with real life cases and examples. <br><br>  In addition, several reports are currently under preparation and review: <br><ul><li>  A report on JUnit5, which is one of the hottest topics of recent months. </li><li>  Showcase from the guys from HERE, who are going to share their work in DevOps &amp; CI processes. </li><li>  A very juicy report from the guys from Badoo, who will share their experience in taming thousands of Gherkin tests. </li></ul><br>  In general, we are still preparing a program, and we cannot say anything precisely about these reports - it all depends on the level of reports that speakers will demonstrate at the preliminary runs. <br><br><h2>  <b>Call for papers</b> </h2><br>  If you yourself want and feel the strength to talk about something hardcore and new to the Russian community of testers - <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/callforpapers/"><b>give us a report</b></a> !  Now we need technologically sophisticated reports with maximum immersion. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b5b/7a2/282/b5b7a228268043d9bab56c801b69da71.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  If you have already spoken somewhere and have met a warm welcome from the organizers and the audience, show us the videotape of the report - this will significantly speed up the decision making by the program committee and increase your chances of performance.  Class performances in the past is one of the important criteria that traditionally guides our program committee. <br><br>  Beginners should not be afraid either - we will definitely communicate with everyone.  Moreover, if your topic is fresh and interesting, we will do everything to hone the content of the report, the technique of performance, timings and presentation, in general, to prepare the perfect report with you, for this we even started a special section in the blog. <br><br>  As usual, program updates can be monitored on the conference website, and the list of confirmed speakers can also be monitored there. <br><br>  <b>PPS</b> If suddenly after reading the post you wanted to register - for the first hundred tickets we have a <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/registration/"><b>special price</b></a> that will increase with the number of tickets purchased.  And for those who are far from St. Petersburg, there is an online broadcast. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/323628/">https://habr.com/ru/post/323628/</a></p>
