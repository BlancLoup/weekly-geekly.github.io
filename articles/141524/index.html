Inside the body of the joystick there are 4 giant Soviet military "micro buttons", which are pressed by the protrusions of the handle of the joystick when it is rejected.  When the circuit is closed, the corresponding electromechanical valve in the channel of the pneumatic system opens, the air presses on the hydraulic cylinder piston, and that moves the carriage. <br><br>  After the army I had to somehow survive, and there was no time for flying and joysticks, but in the end in 2003 I ended up in Moscow as a sales manager at <a href="http://www.defender.ru/">Defender</a> <br>  Do I have to say that I asked for a joystick as a gift for my first birthday?  =) <br>  It was <b>Thrustmaster Afterburner 2</b> , which was presented to me with the words: <i>‚ÄúWell, you and a fool, it would be better if we bought you a microwave‚Äù</i> =) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/683/2a2/f59/6832a2f5910aba45e25d4f60e00d706f.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Well, who has a joystick, he should play <b>Stormtrooper IL-2</b> !  I firmly settled <a href="http://forum.1csc.ru/index.php%3F/forum/37-%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB-2-%25D1%2588%25D1%2582%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA/">on the official game forum</a> and even moderated there for several years.  Therefore, I did not miss the topic, where a person who has not flown for a long time, decided to present his joystick <b>HOTAS Cougar</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a14/79f/7e5/a1479f7e5c034ff83b9d63f76af12fe0.jpg" alt="image"><br>  So I got the coolest kit at that time for a flight simulator.  But there was a nuance - even <b>Thrustmaster Afterburner 2</b> for 2500 rubles, although <b>HOTAS Cougar</b> for 12 000 rubles, and the problem is the same - the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/73127/">noise of damned resistors</a> ! <br>  Here is a video explaining the problem on the example of the steering wheels, but in the joysticks the same. <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/myyE2dKE6bY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhqh-uzEx0RZ3vK1YpPXuUlBdE2kw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  I couldn‚Äôt fly normally on <b>Thrustmaster Afterburner</b> about half a year later, and after a year it was possible only to control a bomber, there was no talk of maneuvering fighters fighting, and that's why I joined squadron <b>14TBAP</b> ( <a href="http://www.14tbap.ru/">14th Heavy Bomber Regiment</a> ).  And I got <b>HOTAS Cougar</b> with already killed resistors and with all the external coolness, it was impossible to get normal precise control with it. <br>  We had to find a solution.  The official <b>1C</b> forum was not suitable for this, so I moved to the <a href="http://www.sukhoi.ru/forum/forum.php">Sukhoi.ru</a> forum <br>  It was natural to look for a solution in proximity sensors.  At that moment, everyone heard <a href="">Saitek X52</a> , the first joystick on the Hall sensors, respectively, people were looking for solutions on this base.  Here, for example, <a href="http://www.sukhoi.ru/forum/showthread.php%3Ft%3D32370">how <b>Cougar is</b> reworked on Hall sensors.</a> <br>  All this was good, but not for my crooked pens.  A ready solution was needed, and only <a href="http://www.vkb-flightsimcontrols.com/zakaz/index_z.php">the WKB group</a> offered it. <br>  They sold ready-made sensors and magnets to them, which were mounted on regular Cougar attachments.  These were no longer Hall sensors, but magnetic resistors based on KMZ-41. <br>  But the toad convincingly suggested that <b>$ 40</b> for two sensors is a bust.  And then I thought - we have a large company that sells gaming devices for PCs as well, wouldn't <b>Defender</b> really want to get a joystick in the range on a modern electronic base? <br>  I contacted <b>WKB</b> , agreed that they would assemble a demonstration prototype based on the first joystick found, and this was such a model: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9eb/4d4/c8c/9eb4d4c8cf752494100a8ad45a5204f1.jpg"><br>  The calculation was to show him to our director, and try to interest him in the organization of production.  It was, judging by the forum, in March 2007, the prototype was ready in May.  And here it so happened that just at this time the owner of a factory that makes gaming devices for <b>Defender</b> came to us from China. <br>  I showed him a prototype, he became interested, and our director gave the go-ahead for further work. <br>  The company was ready to buy sensor technology from the <b>VKB</b> and a controller for them to be installed in <b>Defender</b> joysticks.  Do I have to say that, on joy, they gave me a set of sensors for the <b>Cougar</b> ?  =)))

      I believed that the revision of the already finished joystick is not the right way, that a new joystick, a new design, should be developed for a new electronics. <br>  At that moment I was a sales manager and I could offer something to production only through a product manager who worked with a factory of gaming devices.  I formulated my vision of a new gaming set (and I assumed that it should be a set of <b>RUS - Aircraft Control Handles</b> and <b>RUD - Engine Control Handles</b> ), and the manager sent it to the Chinese. <br>  Here is what they did: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/091/19d/6c8/09119d6c84ac294069578ef565d01130.jpg"><br>  I <a href="http://www.sukhoi.ru/forum/showthread.php%3Ft%3D48961">brought the concept to the discussion of</a> <b>Sukhoy.ru</b> forum <b>users</b> and naturally received the answer that it is certainly good, but something less ‚Äúplagiaristic‚Äù and closer to domestic aviation would be better, like this =)) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/20f/e0a/9ed/20fe0a9edc15f034c19d4caaa5b58fc6.jpg"><br><br>  The problem was that the 3D modeler was Chinese, and to explain this wish was very problematic.  But what good are Internet forums - there you just can‚Äôt meet anyone! <br>  <a href="http://www.sukhoi.ru/forum/showthread.php%3Ft%3D48961%26page%3D14%26p%3D1016809%26viewfull%3D1">The right person appeared</a> .  <a href="http://www.sukhoi.ru/forum/member.php%3Fu%3D12757">grOOmi</a> works as an engineer in <a href="">KNAAPO</a> and perfectly models in 3D. <br>  So, on the basis of the ergonomics of the handle of the <b>Su-34</b> fighter-bomber, the <a href="http://www.sukhoi.ru/forum/showthread.php%3Ft%3D49162">RUS began to emerge.</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c69/01f/c76/c6901fc7699d74b0db0ee54c13626fe4.jpg"><br>  Now the joystick has acquired a decent look of the handle of a modern Russian aircraft. <br>  From the unique solutions I would like to note the double upper trigger, the concept of which was invented by me, implemented by <b>grOOmi</b> and remade by the Chinese =)) <br>  The idea was to give the user to press with the index finger either of the triggers separately or both at the same time, while retaining a look similar to a real pen: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f1/e97/39b/4f1e9739b5838e44c7b0dff8ab9043ba.jpg"><br>  And <a href="http://www.sukhoi.ru/forum/showthread.php%3Ft%3D49162%26page%3D37%26p%3D1048205%26viewfull%3D1">that's what happened</a> in the end: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/02d/085/2f2/02d0852f2754a795eb33536431b104c0.jpg"><br><br>  I also suggested making a massive metal plate at the base and releasing its edges beyond the plastic case, so that the joystick could be secured with clamps or screws through the holes.  A similar scheme was subsequently used by <b>Logitech</b> in the <b>G940</b> joystick.  Of course, I want to think that they saw this decision =) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ef0/e11/749/ef0e1174923a5b56f5f2b9e611f4c9b5.jpg"><br><br>  In general, we designed the joystick and handed it over to the Chinese.  But then <a href="http://www.sukhoi.ru/forum/showthread.php%3Ft%3D49162%26page%3D49%26p%3D1078363">I left Defender.</a> <br>  They took me a subscription, that I would not be engaged in developing joysticks for another year and a half, and I started to develop <a href="http://gametrix.ru/">Gametrix</a> gaming devices together with <b>WKB</b> , but in the position of project manager. <br><br>  In <b>Gametrix</b> everything had to start from scratch, in fact, and the name was not there.  The name of the brand <b>Gametrix</b> came up with <a href="http://forum.cyberfight.ru/member.php%3Fs%3D3599e77bcb9ae018b08de07f4b5ea9ac%26action%3Dgetinfo%26userid%3D6371">VicVega</a> , a man known at <a href="http://forum.cyberfight.ru/">Cyberfight</a> , for which he thanks a <a href="http://forum.cyberfight.ru/">lot</a> . <br><br>  It was decided to modify the standard Chinese devices with electronics from <b>WKB</b> . <br>  In general, I didn‚Äôt have any experience with the Chinese at that time, I‚Äôve never been abroad. <br>  I traveled to <a href="http://www.cebit.de/">CeBit</a> , to <a href="http://www.hktdc.com/fair/hkgiftspremiumfair-en/">Hong-Kong Fair</a> , scored catalogs, drove through factories in Shenzhen, and it was decided to do under <b>Gametrix</b> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/85676/">steering wheels</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/125178/">vibronakidki</a> , <a href="http://www.sukhoi.ru/forum/showthread.php%3Ft%3D74779">tracker</a> and <a href="http://gametrix.ru/products/8">RUD</a> . <br>  <i>There were problems - the sea is bottled.</i>  <i>I first wanted to write in detail how we worked on these products, to tell about the tremendous difference in engineering thinking of Russian developers and Chinese engineers, about the stupid investor greed, which led to huge losses of time and, as a result, investor money, about how we ended up rented an apartment and lived in China for a year, but it would have been so voluminous that, I think, few would have mastered it, and most importantly, it would lead us away from the main theme of the post - from joysticks =)</i> <br><br>  So, when I left <b>Defender</b> , other people began to be engaged in the project of the new joystick, with a predictable result. <br>  The whole story is reflected on the forum, so it is easy to tell. <br>  <a href="http://www.sukhoi.ru/forum/showthread.php%3Ft%3D49162%26page%3D55%26p%3D1172373%26viewfull%3D1">The prototype of our model, the</a> factory manufactured in August 2008 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1de/072/17c/1de07217ced0ca7026c1aa30d0ff8a7a.jpg"><br><br>  I through the third hand gave him hold.  The sensations were indescribable.  When they gave me a prototype, I thought I understood how mothers feel about their newborns, I really wanted to swaddle and rock him.  As Doc Emmett Brown said: <i>‚ÄúAt last I did something that WORKS !!!‚Äù</i> . <br>  But of course the Chinese have walked through our design "hard sandpaper."  First, they completely changed the mechanics of the joystick, and second, they added a twist (rotation of the handle around the vertical axis) and the axis of the gas in the form of an unintelligible wheel to the left of the handle.  In general, the prototype required serious improvements that there was no one to do. <br>  Now it is touching to read the forum: ‚Äú <a href="http://www.sukhoi.ru/forum/showthread.php%3Ft%3D49162%26page%3D55%26p%3D1172382%26viewfull%3D1">Joy will go into a series in the near future</a> ‚Äù was said the same in August 2008. The joystick went to the series only in the summer of 2011. <br><br>  How did it happen.  <b>VKB</b> sold <b>Defender a</b> complete set of documentation for the sensor and controller of the joystick, and a full-fledged working prototype was assembled, which was sent to the factory along with the documentation.  I was opposed to giving the Chinese development, but I did not decide.  As a result, the Chinese could not reproduce the electronics, even with a working prototype and complete documentation! <br>  All that they could do is to assemble ‚Äúbased on‚Äù our design, <b>Saitek</b> design and electronics from the gamepad (sic!) <a href="http://www.sukhoi.ru/forum/showthread.php%3Ft%3D67230">Defender R4 nedojoyk</a> , which went on sale. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b21/3ee/5ea/b213ee5ea4c91095103df3f710d87b06.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Two years later, in 2010, we were in this factory, where we were persuaded to teach the Chinese to make working joysticks on magnetic resistors.  Since our developer and soul were rooting for our child, we agreed to finish the <b>Defender</b> joystick for free. <br>  You will not believe what was the main snag.  The Chinese engineers, having all the necessary <a href="http://www.nxp.com/documents/data_sheet/KMZ41.pdf">datasheets,</a> could not understand that the <b>Hall sensor</b> and the <b>magnetic resistor</b> are two different things.  And that for the operation of a magnetic resistor requires a diametrically magnetised magnet. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a00/978/46a/a0097846a8089ee9530c4098c830523d.jpg"><br>  To make it clear - at that time the only joystick on contactless magnetic sensors (known to the Chinese) was the Saitek X52 ENG, and it works on the basis of <a href="http://easyelectronics.ru/datchik-xolla.html">Hall sensors</a> , respectively, to determine the deviation you need to move the magnets away from the sensor, while the magnetic resistor measures the deviations of the magnet poles , i.e., it requires for work that a diametrically magnetised magnet rotates around an axis. <br>  The Chinese, who, according to a long-standing national tradition, invent nothing but copy, two years tried to make our sensors work, moving the magnets of axial magnetization back and moving towards it, they thought that our constructive made a mistake, and <b>Saitek</b> did it all right. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9ae/a54/2b8/9aea542b80e850a08e491fe3e30a9b83.jpg"><br>  We also made a lot of comments to the constructive, forcing to correct what else could be corrected, and little could be corrected already, since tullingi (molds) were already ready. <br><br>  As a result, the joystick brought and put into production.  For the first time, serial samples were shown at <a href="http://www.computextaipei.com.tw/">Computerx</a> 2011 in Taipei.  A special stand with the game <b>IL-2 Sturmovik</b> was made for him, and for 4 days I taught everyone to shoot down Japanese bombers.  Without exaggeration, the <a href="http://www.sukhoi.ru/forum/showthread.php%3Ft%3D69172%26page%3D4%26p%3D1632448%26viewfull%3D1">stand was very popular</a> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f67/2a0/193/f672a0193886e89156b624bb2c6a7768.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fec/5c2/cf3/fec5c2cf360c9256704e43eaec33db34.jpg"><br><br>  And in October, I was forced to leave the <b>Gametrix</b> project and returned to <b>Defender.</b>  On that day, when I returned, the joysticks <a href="http://defender.ru/products/game/gamepad/cobra-m5/"><b>Defender Cobra M5</b></a> first went on sale.  The circle is closed. <br><br>  The joystick was demonstrated at <a href="http://defender.ru/press/news/2011/10/432/">Igromir 2011</a> at the <b>‚ÄúWorld of Aircraft‚Äù</b> game stand and the users and game developers ( <a href="http://www.gaijin.ru/">Gaijin Entertainment</a> ) really liked it. <br><img src="http://defender.ru/userfile/image/ru/_2011/planes.jpg" alt="image"><br>  UPD Now this project is called <a href="http://warthunder.ru/">War Thunder</a> . <br><br>  Komenty on the Internet is also very pleased.

At the same <b>Igromir 2011,</b> their car simulators stood at ALL stands where there were races, including the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/135359/">stand of Sony</a> . <br>  But <a href="http://www.gamestul.ru/avia.htm"><b>GameSTUL is</b> also developing</a> game sites for pilots, and here‚Äôs the result of the first experiment, they gave me a surprise! Donated =) <br><br>  The playing place is a reliable metal frame with a large number of attachment points. <br>  Now all my devices have found a place.  An adjustable stand is provided for fixing the steering wheel in the center, on which the joystick is fixed with screws (I knew, I knew that the holes in the base would be useful!).  In front of him, I installed a frame on which the keyboard is mounted, the monitor was bolted over it. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c7f/6c9/f43/c7f6c9f433d6efdf7f981d8550564812.jpg"><br><br>  All sizes of the system are regulated by moving the bearing parts in the slots and are rigidly fixed with bolts <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/276/a38/155/276a381550820f9773b3b409acbcd52d.jpg"><br><br>  Top right, I secured the shelf for the mouse. <br>  With this shelf is connected here is a story.  After the <b>IL-2</b> enthusiasm, I played tightly in <a href="http://www.battlegroundeurope.com/">World War II Online: Battleground Europe</a> , I still think and I am sure that this is the best in the world simulator of the battlefield of the Second World War, no one could do anything like that.  But in Russia, the game is not popular, because of hardcore and paid.  Accordingly, there sits a bunch of burgs and <a href="http://forums.battlegroundeurope.com/showthread.php%3Ft%3D206990%26highlight">ours who live abroad</a> .  And then a Soskvadovist tells me, they say, one friend in my Germany makes special playing places for the rudders, he is looking for a distributor in Russia, do you want to do it?  Well, why not, especially, <a href="http://www.speedblack.com/flash/wheelgalleries/wheels_gallery_uk.html">everything is so beautiful</a> : <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ee8/01a/e18/ee801ae18c534e71907e77ade1e847cf.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I requested a sample.  Yes, with the rendering the difference is striking!  The handicraft is assembled, the panels are fixed with a zaklepochnik, the system is not stable, when you play, you don‚Äôt twist the steering wheel as you hold the table.  In general, I did not like it.  And the sample remained!  As a mouse shelf, it is even nothing =) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d54/5e4/9b8/d545e49b87436778c42b44f51afb4be4.jpg"><br><br>  With ore the story is like that.  Initially, the joystick was <a href="http://www.sukhoi.ru/forum/showthread.php%3Ft%3D50359%26highlight%3Ddefender">designed as a two-component</a> .  But after I left the throttle, there was no one to design, so the Chinese went the beaten track, copying the Saitek X52 throttle shape and weaving it with buttons and hats to the best of their understanding.  It turned out that they <a href="http://item.taobao.com/item.htm%3Fid%3D4461271721%26ali_refid%3Da3_420520_1007:1102823217:6::1cd8f7291e8be0af136b2c035d6fa7b5%26ali_trackid%3D1_1cd8f7291e8be0af136b2c035d6fa7b5">had</a> : <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/60b/75c/e82/60b75ce82bd8939cc180036405d4385f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There is a single USB-connected ORE on the market, this is the <b>CH Pro Throttle</b> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3e0/4ef/e14/3e04efe14b27063ce1a77f53a83529b1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At a price of <a href="http://www.bsplus.ru/web/main.asp%3Faction%3Dtovpod%26elem%3D160908">4200 rubles</a> , he does not enjoy particular popularity - for such money, you can take a <a href="">full set of RUS and RUD Saitek X52</a> , and even on Hall sensors. <br>  Accordingly, we decided to close this gap: we collected the throttle on a magnetic resistor, changed the color, made a ‚Äúrubber‚Äù coating, one comrade drew us a cool picture of the Su-27 for drawing on the hull, paid for the necessary changes to the molds, and recently started <a href="">to sell the price is 1350 rubles</a> . <br>  I dare to assert that he is no worse than CHO from <b>CH</b> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2fa/d1b/732/2fad1b7325983b246f753d4c130e0fa9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Included with the <b>GameSTUL</b> gaming chair are metal frames, they fit perfectly to the size of the base of the ORE, I secured it with a thick ribbon.  It should be like a glove.  And behind it is the <a href="http://a4tech.ru/products/keyboard/game/g-100/"><b>A4Tech G100</b></a> gaming keyboard. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8e4/d53/416/8e4d53416902553dc2a3bbccc502dff3.jpg"><br><br>  I am now engaged in a tight flight simulator <a href="http://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/%3Flang%3Dru">Ka-50 Black Shark</a> , but there are no extra buttons in it. <br><br>  The important point is feedback.  There is a <b>ButtKicker</b> fastener on the <a href="http://buttkicker.ru/">GameSTUL frame</a> , but as you already understand, I also have a <a href="http://buttkicker.ru/">vibronacaid</a> .  It seemed unreasonable to lay it on top of such a wonderful chair, especially since there is a zipper on the chair, which allows you to remove the cover without serious consequences.  So, I ruthlessly opened the cape, cut out the seats inside the chair, and moved the motors inside the chair.  Now the whole chair vibrates during the game, which, as they say, delivers =) <br><br>  I also have a tracker.  The tracker, if anyone does not know, is a device for controlling the review by turning the head.  I use the <a href="http://gadget63.narod.ru/hj54.htm">HeadJoy</a> tracker <a href="http://gadget63.narod.ru/hj54.htm">.</a>  Of course, it does not look very presentable, but it copes well with its task.
