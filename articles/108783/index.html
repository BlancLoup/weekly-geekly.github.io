Help comes completely from an unexpected place - the State.  We are talking about 350 000 rubles, which you (attention!) <b>Will give!</b>  But you have to pay some bureaucratic fuss and loss of time.  We will talk about small enterprises registered in the city of Moscow, as I am writing from my own experience. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/42/ef/42ef64babf4ea6a14ee6fb5d84ab04b5.jpg"><br><br>  Under the program to promote small business development in Moscow (in other regions there are analogues), any small business entity can receive <b>up to 350,000 rubles</b> under the following conditions: <br><ul><li>  It is necessary to invest at least 50% of own funds; </li><li>  You need to have a room and a lease; </li><li>  It is necessary to spend more than 50% of the provided subsidies for the purchase of fixed assets; </li><li>  Reimbursement of rent from the budget - no more than 3,600 rubles.  per sq.m.  in year; </li><li>  For consumables can spend no more than 20% subsidies. </li></ul><br>  Conditions are satisfied?  Then we act!

Throughout the process, there will be a lot of pitfalls, and I‚Äôm going to talk about them in this article, based on the experience of my company (we are implementing OST and technical support). <br><br><h4>  Registration in the registry </h4><br>  This is the first step towards treasured budget money.  To register in the register of small entrepreneurs you need to prepare the following documents: <br>  - Original of all constituent documents; <br>  - Order No. 1 (on the appointment of the head); <br>  - <a href="http://dmpmos.ru/logos/3B40D0D7F72041D084BC222D3CC7326A/%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BA_%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_v3_09.xls">Application for registration in the registry</a> . <br><br>  After that we go to <a href="http://dmpmos.ru/info.asp%3Fid%3D21">the department website</a> , find the address and phone number of the branch in the district where your company is registered.  Check the phone time and go with all the documents to the branch.  If there is no queue, documents will be accepted fairly quickly. <br>  They also gave me information brochures and offered to sign an agreement on the protection of small enterprises.  Let me explain what kind of contract.  A special headquarters has been created in Moscow to combat illegal checks and raiding. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/42a/225/bfa/42a225bfa2377f264ecf07bec6231f97.gif" alt="image" align="left"><br>  After signing this agreement, which, by the way, does not oblige you to anything, you can call the hotline at any time and call an emergency crew of lawyers and accountants who will help to sort out the problem.  Fortunately, I did not have to use this phone, but it would not hurt to be safe. <br><br>  So we filed the documents.  Registration time is two weeks.  In fact, the exchange of documents takes place on Wednesday, so having passed the documents on Tuesday, you will be registered in the registry next week on Wednesday or Thursday. <br><br><h4>  Collect documents </h4><br>  Now, do not lose time and begin to prepare documents for the application for a grant.  The list of documents is very extensive, it took me a little more than two weeks to collect all references and documentary documents, the preparation of the Feasibility Study and estimates.  I cite the entire list of documents with comments: <br>  1. <b>Inventory</b> - we do at the very end on the form, nothing complicated. <br>  2. <b>Application for the provision of funds</b> - fill out the <a href="http://www.dmpmos.ru/logos/18326BEB06C7486CAAAE1F894FBF84C1/%25D0%25A4%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%2520%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8.xls">form</a> , also nothing complicated. (The image is clickable) <br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/8f/f9/8ff9923fe08043a740854042f91e27b1.jpg"></a> <br>  3. The <b>feasibility study</b> is one of the most difficult points, it is necessary to write the feasibility study in the form of the department, taking into account all their wishes.  Be sure to consult your district for recommendations on the preparation of a feasibility study.  The most important thing is to describe the essence of your business very clearly, to describe it so that any expert, even if he is far from computers, understands.  Also a subtle point in the feasibility study is the compilation of a tax table.  We must be very careful. <br>  4. <b>Cost estimate with decoding</b> - it is necessary to fill in the cost estimate and decoding on the <a href="http://www.dmpmos.ru/logos/EDA3ACFDD886423C85C471488D1AC18D/%25D0%259D%25D0%2590%25D0%25A7%25D0%2598%25D0%259D%25D0%2590%25D0%25AE%25D0%25A9%25D0%2598%25D0%2595%2520-%2520%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5%25202%2520-%2520%25D0%25A1%25D0%259C%25D0%2595%25D0%25A2%25D0%2590.doc">form</a> .  It is advisable to start with decoding, then transfer all figures to the estimates in groups themselves.  It is for this estimate that you will spend money and then report - we conclude that this is a very important document. <br>  5. <b>Rental contract</b> - if you have a direct lease, then you must also provide a certificate of ownership of your landlord.  If you have sundarend - your landlord's contract and certificate of ownership. <br>  6. <b>List of creditors and debtors</b> - we write in free form.  If there are no creditors / debtors, we write a certificate that there are none. <br>  7. <b>Copies of licenses and permits</b> - we photocopy (necessarily b / w), we put a seal, a signature, ‚ÄúThe copy is correct‚Äù.  If licenses are not required - we write a certificate that licenses and permits are not required for the activities of the organization. <br>  8. <b>Documents on the appointment of managers</b> - we make copies of orders, if you are the only founder, also decisions on the creation of a society. <br>  9. <b>Personal profile of the manager and accountant</b> - fill in the <a href="http://www.dmpmos.ru/logos/B73EEC5475E2462E9ABBCD502BCEBE22/%25D0%259B%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F%2520%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0.xls">form</a> .  If you are both a manager and an accountant, we duplicate the data and sign in twice. <br>  10. <b>Help from the bank</b> - you can print from the client bank. <br>  11. <b>Documents confirming the availability of own funds</b> - the investor‚Äôs letter of guarantee, funds on the current account, or documents confirming expenses already incurred. <br>  12. <b>Statement of consent to the publication</b> - just fill out a <a href="http://www.dmpmos.ru/logos/5679AB27791B4C52959BCD3356DD4AB4/%25D0%259D%25D0%2590%25D0%25A7%25D0%2598%25D0%259D%25D0%2590%25D0%25AE%25D0%25A9%25D0%2598%25D0%2595%2520-%2520%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5%25204%2520-%2520%25D0%2597%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5%2520%25D0%25BE%2520%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2589%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8%2520%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2584%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8.doc">blank</a> . <br>  13. <b>Help on the absence of debt to the budget</b> - in free form we write a letter to the tax with a request to issue such a certificate, print out in duplicate and carry it to the tax.  One copy will be taken away from you, and on the other one they will put a stamp - it can be handed over to the department. <br>  14. <b>Extract from the register</b> - wherever without it, you need the original or a notarized copy. <br>  15. <b>Copies of constituent documents</b> .  Notarized not required. <br>  16. <b>Forms of balance and reporting</b> - we provide if we already had reporting dates.  If you have never filed reports - we write a certificate that it (reporting) is not. <br>  17. <b>Copy of the tax registration certificate</b> . <br>  18. <b>Certificate of the number of workers in free form</b> . <br>  19. <b>Staffing form.</b>  We write immediately for the future - for 3 months from the estimated date of the project start. <br>  20. <b>Statistics codes Mosgorstat</b> - a copy. <br>  21. <b>Copy of the registration certificate of the organization</b> . <br>  22. <b>Listing from the site dmpmos</b> - we go <a href="http://www.dmpmos.ru/reestrMSP/">here</a> , we drive in our TIN, we receive an extract on registration in the register of small businessmen. <br>  23. <b>The applicant's passport</b> is not one that is in a leather cover.

Give - not quite correct.  when you apply, you indicate how long you will pay taxes on the amount of the grant.  You write it according to the business plan and cannot guarantee 100% payment per day. <br>  2. If you submit an application as an LLC - you risk only the authorized capital (10 000 rubles. For the majority).  This is valid if you used the money for its intended purpose, as indicated in the estimate.  If you spent money on a new set of equipment from Apple - this is a fraud, and already the Criminal Code. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/108783/">https://habr.com/ru/post/108783/</a></p>
