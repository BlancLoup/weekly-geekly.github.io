  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Google does jerk</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Google has long been known for allowing its employees to spend 20% of their work time on ‚Äúexperiments.‚Äù  Now the company is experimenting with a huge number of new projects in line with the so-called ‚Äúengagement policy‚Äù.  This summer, they worked gloriously, having done a lot, including the launch of Google Apps for Your Domain (in partnership with Intuit) and the acquisition of Never Vision, a company engaged in biometric technology.  Looks like they are not going to slow down. <br><br>  Let's look at the major innovations that Google has presented to users recently. <br><br>  <strong>Google Gadgets available to all</strong>

      Gadgets, which used to be used only in Google Desktop, are <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/blog/google/1945.html">now available</a> for insertion into any web pages.  Now site creators can help their visitors plan their travel itinerary or show pictures from Picasa web albums.  What about sports scores, fire maps and traffic accidents?  It looks like next year these gadgets will be everywhere, because they allow not even the most professional webmasters to embed interesting and diverse content into their websites.  And for sure in the near future there will be new "tempting offers", because the <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/events/gadgetawards/index.html">Google Gadgets Awards for Students</a> contest ends on November 15. <br><br>  <strong>Multisite search</strong> <br><br>  An article in <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1541268,00.html">Time Magazine</a> includes an interview with Google employee Marissa Meyer (Marrissa Meyer), who talks about the development of a new multisite search.  This may be similar to <a href="http://rollyo.com/">Rollyo</a> , <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/08/07/yahoo-launches-personalized-search/">Yahoo!</a>  <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/08/07/yahoo-launches-personalized-search/">Search Builder</a> or <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/livesearch/archive/2006/03/28/563482.aspx">Windows Live Search Macros</a> .  This search will be very useful, I look forward to it. <br><br>  <strong>SearchMash</strong> <br><br>  This week, Google launched a new site, whose name is difficult to link to the company's brand - <a href="http://searchmash.com/">SearchMash.com</a> .  He recalls an attempt to combine in one site all the possibilities that Internet users use when searching for information.  Traditional Google search results for text and images are offered on the site in a new way, including rearranging the results using the ‚Äúdrag and drop‚Äù method (as convenient as on Live.com), built on Ajax ‚Äúlong scrolling‚Äù, allowing you to stay on the same page and view an unlimited number of results, as well as a drop-down menu that provides additional options for displaying a URL.  The most remarkable thing is the possibility of a new search with the same parameters inside that domain, on the URL of which the user has already clicked.  Simply put, if you find a site that discusses a question that interests you, you can easily see all the other pages of the site with a similar discussion topic.  Image search results are displayed on the right side of SearchMash pages. <br><br>  <strong>Ajax Search API 1.0</strong> <br><br>  <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/10/create-web-apps-on-top-of-google.html">Google's Ajax Search API 1.0</a> was published today.  The API helps webmasters insert an elegant video, news and map search form made in Ajax, as well as create their own API-based applications.  An example of video search can be seen on <a href="http://www.google.com/uds/solutions/videobar/index.html">this page</a> , click on any frame with a picture to see how it works. <br><br>  The version published today supports search by news (including the ability to limit search results to several sources), map search (including maps of Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Spain), as well as access to the API via intranet firewalls.  Google is also experimenting with placing contextual advertising in search results through the API.  There is no charge for clicks from advertisers yet, but it is obvious: in general, this idea is at the stage of serious study. <br><br>  Everything described above makes it clear that Google is keeping up with the times.  Yahoo is moving in the same direction with its projects and upcoming acquisitions.  Facebook does no less.  ‚ÄúThe policy of engagement‚Äù is now the lot not only of small firms-idealists: it was adopted by business sharks.  Who will succeed?  Perhaps Yahoo!  Who will lose?  MySpace is <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/09/12/myspace-we-dont-need-web-20/">clearly not going there</a> . <br><br>  Leaders are involved in the game.  And the question arises whether they will abide by the rules in the struggle among themselves and in working with our information. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/30856/">https://habr.com/ru/post/30856/</a></p>
