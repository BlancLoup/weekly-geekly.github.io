If yes - welcome under cat. <br><br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/2c/38/2c3807a35066a46ac6120d3895ec69d6.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, if you like to drive on controlled cars, you can buy yourself some and ride for fun.  But skating alone pretty quickly annoying.  I want to drive with someone, but it does not always work.  Remember the same Doom, for example (or a quack, or any other shooter).  One thing is not as interesting as a crowd over a network. <br><br>  Exactly on the basis of this thought, we did a thing called ‚ÄúMachines controlled via the Internet‚Äù.

      Everything is simple - <a href="http://www.mikrogonki.ru/content/nashi-trassy">open the page</a> , see the list of tracks.  So far there are only two tracks, one in Moscow, the second in St. Petersburg.  Stand in line (you must press the button "Stand in line", your KO).  As soon as your turn comes up - a window will open with the broadcast and the ability to control the machine.  Control from the keyboard - arrows (forward, backward, left, right) and Ctrl - Fast and the Furious.  Oh yeah, to be able to stand in line, you must be registered on the site. <br><br>  The basic functionality is now implemented - a queue, control of cars, video and audio broadcast.  In the process of development, the translation ‚Äúin 3D‚Äù (remember <a href="http://www.g0l.ru/states/n2868">this topic</a> ?) Is a regular anaglyph stereo image, but the control of the cars in this form looks pretty cool.  Also in the process of finishing interactive on the track.  QR codes are glued to the cars, there is a special camera on the track (by the way, this camera is visible on the photo, on the bracket in the form of the letter GE. We will fasten the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/DIY/108058/">controlled camera</a> here ... In general, the plans are enormous. And most importantly, all the plans have already been partially started implemented, the most important plug-in ‚Äúhow to do it" is passed. It remains to bring to mind. <br><br>  Now they decided to hang this topic on Habra, to listen to what people would say about such a toy.  It seems to me that it is an order of magnitude more interesting than any mail "billiards", etc.  For here there are real objects that, after all, are more interesting to manage than those drawn. <br><br>  Another important aspect is that the implemented control with observation through the camera is suitable not only for our favorite small Q-steer machines, but also for any other toys.  The radio-controlled machine of a fairly decent size, with an analog camera screwed to it with a radio transmission, already drives along the floor of the house.  But there are still some small problems, so we don‚Äôt show it yet. <br><br>  So, the most important link is <a href="http://www.mikrogonki.ru/content/nashi-trassy">http://www.mikrogonki.ru/content/nashi-trassy</a> .  It says about the necessary requirements for the normal functioning of the tracks.  If you want to try it live and go - Wellcome! <br><br>  By default, video streaming is shown (via smotri.com) from the second camera.  When taxiing using another camera, a separate broadcast.  The delay is minimal. <br><br>  One ‚Äúbut‚Äù - there are a lot of people on Habr√©, and there are only 7 machines at the moment. 4 in St. Petersburg and 3 in Moscow.  Skiing time is limited to five minutes, so that more people have time to ride.  It is possible to increase the limit (who has more bonuses, he is higher in the line and rides longer) - <a href="http://www.mikrogonki.ru/content/kak-pokatatsya-vne-ocheredi-0">read the manual here</a> . <br><br>  Management machines made me and Eugene <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/realizator/" class="user_link">Realizator</a> . <br><br>  PS I do not publish technical details yet - this is the first topic, an overview.  Well, we just wanted to check under heavy load.  May Habrasila be with us and may he not show servag 503rd error ... <br><br>  PPS We are looking forward to feedback and reports on the glitches seen.  For glitches sometimes float, everything is not perfectly licked. <br><br>  UPD&gt; I remembered that it reminded me.  Carmageddon in real :-D <br><br>  UPD&gt; Habraeffekt in action - the server did not cope :-) <br><br>  UPD&gt; An important nuance is that many people in the queue hang because the player cannot connect to the caster or Stratus.  You can check the connection here, for example - <a href="http://cc.rtmfp.net/">http://cc.rtmfp.net/</a> .  This is not a completely correct test, but so far at least this. <br><br>  UPD&gt; For those who could not see live - video from past testing <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/1eiVdLamJ4M%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhL6_Gql6gNLzn3M4BguQB2z_uusA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>About past skating:</b> <br>  Many thanks to all testers.  We apologize to all who had to be thrown out of the queue.  Because of non-connected peers, the entire queue was slowed down, so you had to quit.  To be honest, I'm in shock that so many people have come.  In the queue was constantly 110-160 people.  Most waited for hours (the record was like three and a half hours).  And what is most interesting - waiting for their turn to steer.  Respect for patience.  Of course, the server that fell during the first hours of skiing spoiled the nerves a bit, but, thank God, the hosts improved and the server did not fall anymore.  Many had problems with the passage of UDP, or the firewall on the computer blocks, or the router, or the provider.  Here we, unfortunately, are powerless.  It was a shame when several people who sent SMS for bonus skating, could not ride in the future because the connection did not work. <br><br>  In general, we caught a bunch of bugs, there is something to work on.  We will fix, and then run again, in an improved form.  I hope ... <br><br>  UPD&gt; I completely forgot to say: you can control the cars with a joystick / gamepad.  Quite convenient, you can fall apart in a chair and steer :-) For this you need to use the program for mapping gamepad buttons on the keyboard keys.  I, for example, use for this <a href="http://www.electracode.com/4/joy2key/JoyToKey%2520English%2520Version.htm">JoyToKey</a> .  To heighten the effect, you can use the steering wheel with pedals.  From the side it looks the best. <br><br>  UPD&gt; Videos from the second day of skiing <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/m0cKJPkxDtc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhWj6s-w_EL6azMPfoxjptBh_SS6w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  UPD&gt; Mikrogonok now <a href="http://twitter.com/">has a Twitter account</a> .  If someone suddenly wants to follow the updates and the opening of the next pokatushek, which is not regular. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/119000/">https://habr.com/ru/post/119000/</a></p>
