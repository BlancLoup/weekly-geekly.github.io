I remember in perestroika, in 1986, I came from the army, went to look.  The Moscow Planetarium had a ‚ÄúAfghanistan‚Äù store, and there was a famous technical flea market there.  There are all sorts of tape recorders in abundance.  Then, by the way, the boombox was bought with a friend, I remember how ‚ÄúBoney M‚Äù sounded on the balcony. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/712/45e/c48/71245ec486d55a04fcfc0f5efc444d7f.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Cool column.  The sound in different directions, loud, but it is not very noisy.  I suppose I walk with Nyusha and Savva and put them something.  Walking through the woods, I put something complicated.  A complex work - it is perceived in nature in a different way.  And I pull a column on my hand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bb1/a5d/af1/bb1a5daf13bca427b0fed1c9deea8918.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1eb/aa0/383/1ebaa03833b413eda3fee55af1fa84e9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The radio, which is needed when playing with children, or for long journeys and transitions.  We love extreme, we almost always have a walkie-talkie.  By the way, these are some of the best.  Children have small walkie-talkies, but the house is also partially radio-controlled.  That's just on a submarine there is such a thing: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/784/654/cd4/784654cd4c29d2768606da1fbb2ab52e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e81/31c/21e/e8131c21e62a394b75a47f7a7137c416.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Intercom <br><br>  Now I will show the phones.  Every functional, with each I went once.  By the way, out of all Vertu, I chose a single cot.  I liked how it snaps, there is something from a Swiss watch in it.  I can imagine that I will give this piece of iron to my grandson.  And now Vertu, probably, is nonsense. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a69/af8/1db/a69af81dbd2e56bea0a793a3dfcbf2ad.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Phone is convenient.  The first phones are a revolution in consciousness that you can talk to a person on the other side of the planet on a mobile phone with some kind of thing in your hands. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/df9/670/864/df9670864d9fa81945459b0762b4c34b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/437/597/091/437597091f9c49e0e47aac5e263200ef.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/63c/427/20e/63c42720ef7f7ef924f84fd0ca9314b2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0a6/704/3eb/0a67043eb40d733fc592d74a03467c82.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The most used applications are calendar, prayer book, twitter.  And Star Walk, because we travel a lot.  At some point, you caught yourself thinking that it was curious to know how the ancient Persians knew what constellation you are under.  It is interesting to seek out satellites, many already abandoned satellites, to watch their stories. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/104/9bd/fd4/1049bdfd47b5839dd484e1764e53e2e5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Here they are a whole bunch: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f08/086/c1d/f08086c1d0c3cce04876cf60a6d3f8e6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And all the workers, I take care of them, recharge them.  Near the iPad lies, at home tablets of 5 different models.  By the way, a long time ago on my first tablet with a resistive screen, I printed a book.  I spent three months at night sitting in the country and typing a book with a stylus.  By the way, the book on Warcraft was.  Communicated with the guys who did Allods.  Together pee.  Then I got hooked on Warcraft already.  This is the whole story.  For example, I have a friend, the richest man.  But wealth is not its main advantage, but rather a technical element.  He is a tourist, he is an ethnographer, and he is a fan of Warcraft.  I changed the Phantom to a Ford van to make a table on the inside, a hanging screen.  And driving an army there in Warcraft.  Whether the 20th, or 21st place in the world line.  Still playing.  This, like chess, is, in essence, only expanded, visualized.  Very proud of his achievements in Warcraft more than financial, more than about him in Forbes tell.  There are a lot of such people - there is a microsurgeon, there are cops, there are car mechanics, robbers, and whoever is there who loves.  This is the whole game.  And only then Warhammer appeared. <br><br>  But the weapon. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ef1/b54/9ba/ef1b549baf3d3dfe86c3bafd77a3d21f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As far as I can remember, I always went with a knife.  Dad gave me the first knife. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2c8/50c/247/2c850c247255fc4ca12c80bd283d00bc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Gold corrugated knives - for me nonsense.  Because it is impossible to practice too much beauty.  And for hunting the knife can be damask, some old, but it should be practical.  When it's gilded, well, that's cool, but a little weird. <br><br>  If the knife is used for idleness, you cut it loose.  They can not indulge.  My children know it.  Or here's a heavy knife tends to break, and therefore it is necessary to remove the leg when they work.  Children should also be aware of this, as well as the fact that the trunk should not be pushed so that the trigger finger rests.  Yes, if the children find ammunition in me (which is unlikely), then they will in no way carry them to the fire. <br><br>  I tried different gadgets for health.  From all that I have learned for myself, these are the Fedorov ophthalmic glasses, which are yellow. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/935/23b/c08/93523bc08c25bebfdec5c94d7da2abf4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I go to them and go most of my life, because I type a lot, and they cherish their eyes.  And my eyes are still good, and I have already been an uncle from that millennium. <br><br>  Moreover, if all the gadgets throw out, then nothing will change.  We are Tushino ethnopanks.  And I treat this as black caviar.  If it is not, then nothing will change.  By the way, I am a Greenpeacer.  I have been leading a war with Oksanka for many years, that she wants a real Christmas tree, and I want an artificial one, because I feel sorry for the real one.  True, she always wins.  Likewise with this: it will not and will not.  We are accustomed to everything.  It will not, I will be happy to recall the little Jobs.  And somewhere on the clay tablet, the Sumerian cuneiform calmly filled out something. <br><br>  Everything, I will go to make out that Katerina from Beeline has brought new things for LTE.  And you tell me so far: what do you have in your pockets now and on the shelves of interesting things from gadgets? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/205536/">https://habr.com/ru/post/205536/</a></p>
