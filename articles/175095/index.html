Do not believe it is not.  The story of contrasts in the conditions of work in foreign and Russian companies, action development in java / GWT, lies colleagues and the behavior of the Director, enjoying his omnipotence and permissiveness, not supported by law. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1f2/b25/426/1f2b25426d113e1b653379f53a7d7b4f.jpg"><br><br>  This story began when the project ended at the last work.  Everything was solid: a large international company, business trips to the USA and England, stability and easy boredom due to the large amount of routine on the project.  No rush, a well-developed development process, a separate QA team and automated tests, foreign management for a couple of years of work has never raised a voice for anyone in the team, the project manager calmly transferred the functionality to the next releases, when they didn‚Äôt have time to develop and test.  An excellent team of professionals, everyone can be trusted and know that in a difficult moment will help.  The atmosphere of friendship when it is pleasant to come to work and communicate.  But all good and calm always comes to an end: (And then, like strips of a zebra, a new band appeared in my life ... <a name="habracut"></a>

      Then still in the smoking room with one of his colleagues discussed his new job.  He campaigned to go to him under the leadership, when the current project is completed.  Strange, then I trusted this man, although I felt arrogance towards others.  And as it turned out later, this was the arrogance of the newly-minted ‚Äúmanager,‚Äù who, for a small amount of money, bought the time of the outsourcers after work and helped in mastering the budget of a large airline.  He did not just get there either, but through our other colleague.  Leaving for work in another country, he introduced him to the Director.  You tell me that I am writing the wrong word, which should be written with a small letter, but here it is only in this way that the person should be addressed and only by the name of the patronymic) Specificity of Russian small business.  While it is much easier to communicate with foreigners or managers of large companies after the fact, there are less difficulties in communicating. <br><br>  From a colleague, I heard about how they all have nanotechnology there) He called my future average salary with regard to bonuses.  Here I became interested!  As for the scope of work, he said that if you come up with the mind, you can work 4 days a week, the loads are not terrible.  It became even more interesting.  And then they already went into the course of the stories about the Director: a wide-hearted person, does not spare money and thanks fabulously for his work, saying that he is also an investor in technology start-ups.  And it invests in such projects that in aviation this is just the beginning.  Soon everyone will buy the product in which he invests.  Then I listened, brushing noodles from my ears, but I liked the basic conditions on the potential work from the story.  As it turned out later, this investor does not particularly want to finance his main job with the promised salary.  Only here is the snag, the project will start in late autumn, and the employment contract with me will be signed right away as they sign the agreement with the airline.  Just before the New Year 2013. Here it was necessary to guard.  And I believed a colleague!  Up to this point of our communication in the smoking room, he did not deceive me and I considered him to be my friend. <br><br>  Then there was an acquaintance with the Director.  Office in the center, next to Chistye Prudy in the mansion, a monument of architecture.  Old parquet and ceilings 4m high.  It reminded me of childhood and the building of the music school in the palace of congresses, sorry I was distracted.  So, I'm about dating.  This man did not immediately arrange for himself, since it was in his manner of communicating a subtle something slippery.  The coloring was given to the cabinet by pictures in frames, with Jews in national costumes and headdresses.  They seem to be discussing their gesheft on these pictures.  We agreed that a written contract would be concluded with me as soon as they enter into their contract with the customer.  The director asked me about the salary, I called the amount.  He added 5000r to her, of course, I didn‚Äôt argue!) But then it turns out that in a couple of months I‚Äôll have to be content with quite a small salary.  I opposed that I did not agree to a fall.  He argued that he would have no money for a couple of months, and then he would compensate me for the difference.  It was necessary to immediately take a receipt from him about the amounts and dates.  Later it turned out that the memory for the amount of my salary he worked in the smaller side to 15000r.  At the time of discussing the salary of a colleague, the wind blew out of the office.  The conversation was face to face with the Director.  I also understood that if they did not sign a contract with the customer, I would go look for a new job.  But I did not talk about it, I guessed.  Decided to take a chance! <br><br>  So, a couple of months have passed without work, waiting for a new project.  Time for nothing lost, it took on sports and hobbies.  Money from the last work gradually ended ... <br><br>  The first weeks of work at the new site were spent studying ways to migrate a large aviation security application with Oracle Forms technology that is no longer supported on modern development frameworks and UI web application widgets.  In the first days worked from home.  There were videoconference talks with colorful immigrants from India living in Holland.  He tried to give us his product, gave us a trial version and gave a couple of webinars.  Having dug deep into their converter, it turned out that it solves 30% -40% of our conversion problems, and the most difficult thing remains to be done manually.  And unfortunately, it does not save from understanding the specifics of Oracle Forms.  As a result, we sent them a few bug reports on the support of the Russian language and component layout, a piece of code from my PL / SQL parser for form triggers and said goodbye to the Dutch.  Wrote a job application in early November.  I actively participated in the creation of the system‚Äôs archive and the development plan for this large project.  For a week, I locked myself in an apartment to implement the Proof of concept.  As a result, I made the oracle forms xml parser, which at the output produced an object model of the form and a DAO for working with it.  The UI of the tables and forms itself remained overboard, but this was already trivial compared to the main work.  The coordinates of the widgets are in xml, the fields are in the converter, the type is already known.  Even LOV (list of values) forms were implemented, which was not in the product that we wanted to buy initially. <br><br>  And then I was pulled out of the protracted unnecessary negotiations (my colleague liked them very much, because for foreigners he introduced himself as a development director and he also thought that the product would solve everything himself) and the POC: it turns out that ‚Äúyesterday‚Äù it was necessary to make the first module on the not yet signed customer project.  Moved to work in the office, but not for long.  In the same place, the Director asked to always close the office with a key when I was inside.  Arguing that if granny any door is wrong, then you will not expel her from the office until the end of the working day.  And in fact, one day, the bailiffs came and sealed the door of the office because of the claims of the new owners of the premises.  It‚Äôs good that I wasn‚Äôt at that moment inside, but again I did the functional day and night from home.  These are the grandmothers of bailiffs and macaroni on the ears! <br><br>  Yes, the module had to pass urgently.  No TK, no documents.  Communicate with the customer, find out what he needs, but do not have time to formalize in the signed TK.  Fortunately, the customer was literate and it was very easy to work with him.  Requirements for the module in the mass were adequate.  When the customer came up with scary features, it was quite possible after half an hour of negotiations to convince them that they really didn‚Äôt need it to look that way.  You can make it more convenient for the user, but in a different way.  Overtime began at night and on weekends because of the features of the product and the new for me version of the GWT frontend technology with RequestFactory.  In the same module, we had to implement most of the functionality of another module of the system - reports.  Setting up the JasperServer open source edition to use the Oracle database for storing the report repository was not easy.  But the impossible in the open source world is not!  There is not only enough free time and expertise to finish the open source project to the desired state.  But here I was lucky and it took a little more than one day to configure JasperServer on Oracle. <br><br>  The New Year was approaching, and I was still not officially decorated.  It began to appear that they were waiting for the promised 3 years.  A week before NG, the module was commissioned to the customer.  I did it alone and it cost almost like my half-yearly salary, taking into account the Director‚Äôs forgetfulness on the amount of salaries. <br><br>  And then, unexpectedly for myself, I began voluntarily-compulsively engaged in the support of production of another system at the customer.  Although I did not have knowledge about her, but I was happily woken up one day with shouts of ‚Äúeverything does not work for us‚Äù.  The funny thing is that the money for her support was received by a colleague who was sunbathing on the sea these days.  True, in the end, he repaired it from the airport, but the sediment remained.  Well, I always dreamed about such work !!! <br><br>  I spent the New Year holidays voluntarily, so that later the same number of days could be done away and rush away from Moscow.  Over the holidays, I made a demo part of managing a ‚Äúfat client‚Äù for editing iReport reports using only a browser with javascript, canvas and websocket without using java / flash browser plug-ins.  At the same time, a small part of the authentication and authorization system was written, which is used in all modules of the system.  They told me stories that the contract has not yet been signed and fed them with breakfasts and stories about a bright future in their company and awards.  In fact, their contract with the customer was signed before the New Year.  When on working days after the holidays I took a well-deserved and spent time off, they asked me to install a new application remotely on the server even for Moscow to show the customer.  Together with the modifications it took me 6 hours of holidays. <br><br>  Work at home days, nights, weekends.  The first "normal" salary is January 31, which in fact turned out to be 15 rubles less than what we discussed with the Director.  He immediately expressed his indignation, but in response, "I could not promise you such a sum, you did not understand me correctly."  Yes, it seems the director at the age of me keeps sclerotic.  My work for money is far from being similar to what was promised, and somewhere at the level of work without straightening out on the plantation for comfort.  I asked to send my employment contract in the coming days, before I sign it, so that I know what I sign.  I fed breakfast.  A colleague withdrew from disputes, saying that he was not in the office when the Director and I discussed salary. <br><br>  I do not know about you, but I do not like liars !!!  No, conscience is a concept that everyone interprets in his own way.  For some, it turns off with a lot of money, for someone with a sense of its elitism.  When people are ready to go over other people's heads to fill their pockets ... I do not accept this from school.  Like everyone around me, they tried to ‚Äúthrow‚Äù me at work and side work.  I studied, sometimes lost in local situations, but I got experience.  Apparently this is the most important thing, not to fall into the same or similar trap later.  And if you hit, then know how to get out of it.  I apologize, again suffered in the philosophy. <br><br>  The next day we went to the meeting to the customer.  In the same contract, with the same project budget, they want to add another financial module and expand the functionality of other modules.  And the worker on the project is me alone.  The customers do not know this, the Director even wanted to take a couple of outsiders for extras and solidity of our company, but it did not work out.  We were sitting at a meeting from our office, the three of us: me, a colleague and a Director.  I was lucky and most of the new functionality of our management compartment with different arguments.  After the meeting, I alone expressed everything I didn‚Äôt like on this project to a colleague who lured me to work.  He began again to try to zombie me with stories about a bright future and how I would be happy and rich, when I would still have the support of this system.  I interrupted it and began to discuss the present.  But it turned out to be rather drab and dull: I have no rights and have not yet been registered for the Labor Code, the salary is lower than agreed, there is so much work that the weekends often also go there and want to add more functionality.  To which I received the answer "you spin me eggs."  No, what are they doing to me?  Further it will be even more fun) When I argued that the trust on the oral contract is already lost.  He spoke that he would know.  They say you can work without papers / signatures and that everything is consistent with the agreed.  I was very surprised at this! <br><br>  A meeting with the Director in private in a few days and a discussion about why my salary does not match the agreed.  When discussing such issues, he begins to mumble under his breath, so as not to make out in the jumble of words what he answers.  From what I could understand and ask again - this is the fact that he always cannot simply find such money at the ZP is too difficult.  And he gave me a one-time handout with money, which if divided into all paid salary, in the end, on average, the average salary was still 15 rubles lower than the agreed income level.  The director likes to demand results and discuss the work always clearly, articulately and with the proposal of new features.  Most of the meeting discussed the road map of the project.  When I asked, so what kind of prize would I have in reality, he retired.  They say you need to discuss with a colleague.  It was the middle of February. <br><br>  At the end of February I had a cold on my legs, working without leaving home. <br><br>  He got his old framework for code generation of CRUD applications on GWT out of 2010 dust.  Added support for new widgets and Request Factory.  The old code still served me and the entire front-end admin generated from the object model with annotations.  It worked out pretty well for the generated interface.  Especially because when adding fields, validations, etc.  All this was reflected quite easily in the GWT code.  Validation of JSR303 + RequestFactory so easily and simply did not want to work with RequestFactoryEditorDriver and the widgets that I used.  Began a long battle with magical technology.  Won.  Code refactoring, highlighting the common authentication code into separate maven modules.  Development of the own implementation of the Single Sign-On mechanism and its successful integration into the financial module developed by NG me and working in pilot production. <br><br>  The browser editing module has also been successfully integrated with the authentication and authorization system implemented by the customer of SSO.  My long and hard work as a system administrator for a virtual debian server has ended.  A pool of user accounts in VM was created, a mechanism was developed for mapping single information system accounts to local accounts inside a virtual machine.  Managing VNC sessions inside a virtual machine from my application with the websocket jetty server. <br><br>  My friends often began to tell me that I looked pale and tortured.  At the end of March I collapsed with a cold and a temperature of +39.6.  Three days ago, a colleague and a Director called me and asked how my state of health, how I am so strong and involved in sports, can get sick so often.  Irritation escalated.  In fact, it's time to change jobs.  From the moment I realized that I was being deceived, I was at several interviews.  So, everywhere offered white design from the first day of work, the amount of fixed salary more than the current location.  Yes, the promised premiums were much smaller, but the fix was a bit more and the work was calmer.  Due to the current situation due to the absence of the promised clearance after 5 months of work, the salary was not at all of the same level as it was discussed, and I found it quite ethical to resign unilaterally without 2 weeks of working out with unpaid overtime and support of other applications.  In my opinion, quite honestly, when, on the one hand, the terms of cooperation are replayed unilaterally, you also need to break the verbal obligations that have not been backed up by the company‚Äôs papers on the Labor Code of the Russian Federation (note, in fact, I have been waiting for them for 5 months).  Not just with a company, but with a project undertaking for a major airline‚Äôs security service.  The project, the principles of which is next to such sensational ideas in the press as ‚Äúblack lists‚Äù of passengers, deportation of violators, etc.  The firm has not bothered for 5 months of work with me to sign an employment contract.  Everything that is written here is completely legitimate and formally does not represent any mystery, since I also was not allowed to sign an agreement on non-disclosure of working information. <br><br>  Sick and weak, as the temperature was a bit asleep, I wrote a project for editing reports in the browser.  A colleague arrived, showed him.  He seemed to like it, but he still came up with a few more features in the best traditions of this company, which I need to add and so that at the same time I also made a couple of reports for the customer in this application.  By limiting the terms to April 15th.  I abruptly stopped him and offered to take a walk and talk. <br><br>  He took him outside to talk.  He said that I quit from today.  Clearly, the points explained the reasons.  I chided him as a naughty child for lies.  He also asked where he had deceived.  Without being embarrassed, I told everything in detail, without insulting and not going to his personal assessment.                       )     ,    .       ‚Äî   ,        .   !       .       , ,       .  -    ,    .        : ¬´      .        -     ¬ª.  !!!      ! <br><br>  10-15 ,  ,      : ¬´ ,      ¬ª,       .          . , ,  maven        DDD.       ,      .   : ¬´    !       .¬ª,   .   : ¬´   ,  ,      .      ,     ,   ¬ª.  ,  , -  ¬´, !¬ª   . <br><br>     ,       .     ¬´   ,    ¬ª   .   ¬´         !?¬ª   ¬´,  (     ). , !    ...¬ª.     :              ,        ,         ,  ,      .  ,   2   ,     (       ,       ).                ,      ,      ,      (     ),        .         ,                .          ,         ,  ,         (  -, ,     !).           ,            ¬´  ¬ª.      ,              ( :                ,   ,     ).     ,  ¬´   ¬ª,        .  ,    DDL     .        4.5                 ,    .           ,     ¬´     ¬ª     ,  ¬´   ¬ª,     .  ,  ,       ,         . ,           3 . <br><br>                  .
