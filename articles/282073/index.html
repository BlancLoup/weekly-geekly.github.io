In the summer of last year, <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/mirantis_openstack/blog/261243/">we already told you</a> about such a phenomenon as the World OpenStack Summit.  More precisely - they showed some ‚Äúpictures from the exhibition‚Äù.  But they did not explain how to look at these pictures.  It's time to fix the mistake. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4c0/8d5/ba0/4c08d5ba0c064e34af45feea984c7eb1.jpg">

      So, the <a href="https://www.openstack.org/summit/">World OpenStack Summit</a> is the main event of our industry.  It takes place twice a year: in the fall and in the spring.  As a rule, a week is given to this event in the calendar of each ‚ÄúOpenStekker‚Äù.  It would be more accurate to speak not about one, but about two events that so far take place at the same time and in one place: this is the OpenStack Summit and the Design Summit.  Our <a href="https://www.mirantis.ru/what-is-openstack/glossariy/slovar-kontributora/">Contributor Dictionary</a> defines these terms: <br><br>  <i><b>OpenStack summit</b> - a conference that is held twice a year.</i>  <i>During this event, developers, users, administrators and operators of OpenStack get together and discuss projects implemented with the help of OpenStack, directions for the development of this ecosystem, methods of installation and tricks of use.</i>  <i>The summit promotes the exchange of experience and useful knowledge, and helps the further evolution of OpenStack.</i> <br><br>  Evil techno-language claims that the ‚Äúsummit is not the same‚Äù and that the marketing component has become dominant over the technical one.  And I‚Äôll say from myself: maybe this is for the best.  After all, in the end, in order to repeat the success of Linux, the OpenStack community needs to stop stewing in its own juice and become attractive for those who can turn the initiative of techies into money.  And this, in most cases, people are not technical.  And they just need to talk about the possibilities of the technology being created.  The same goes for interfaces: they should become (and become, that pleases!) More user-friendly.  Otherwise, no matter how functional the open software may be, it will lose to proprietary solutions at the expense of ‚Äúpackaging‚Äù.  Meet, like it or not, on the clothes.  And the UI is the ‚Äúclothes‚Äù of the software product. <br><br>  For fans (and professionals) of hardcore there is a Design Summit.  <a href="https://www.mirantis.ru/company-news/news-company/zhenskoe-delo-vyipusk-1-dina-belova/">Dina Belova</a> and her friends define what a design summit is: <br><br>  <i><b>Design Summit</b> - a conference held twice a year, and devoted exclusively to technical issues of the development of various components of OpenStack.</i>  <i>As a rule, it looks like an informal discussion of specific projects and / or initiatives, as well as cross-project activities.</i>  <i>At the moment, it is being held simultaneously with the OpenStack Summit, but soon the organizers plan to divide them and move to a non-intersecting schedule for the convenience of developers participating in both conferences.</i> <br><br>  Someone will probably become more comfortable.  But for employers, it will definitely become more expensive, since the travel expenses of key engineers will double.  Here the financiers will have joy ... Something tells me that therefore the separation of the two summits is unlikely to happen in the foreseeable future. <br><br>  Now that we have figured out what a significant event is coming next week (this spring‚Äôs summit will be held in Austin, USA, Texas, from April 25 to April 29), let's take a quick look at the program. <br><br>  Traditionally, the most interesting and important part of the summit is the description of real implementations of OpenStack.  At the same time, the farther a company that has made a cloud solution based on OpenStack, from the IT world, the more valuable the experience.  For example, the star of the summit in Vancouver was the Walmart chain of stores.  Austin will feature a whole bunch of user success stories.  And we are pleased to talk about this, as many have put our hands and heads to our engineers. <br><br>  For example, the American telecom giant AT &amp; T uses MOS (Mirantis OpenStack) for its cloud solutions and <a href="https://www.openstack.org/summit/austin-2016/summit-schedule/events/9451">will talk about its experience with OpenStack</a> on Monday, April 25th. <br><br>  A little later that day, <a href="https://www.openstack.org/summit/austin-2016/summit-schedule/events/9456">Volkswagen Group, the largest European automaker,</a> will tell you about your path to OpenStack.  You‚Äôve already heard <a href="https://www.mirantis.ru/company-news/news-company/volkswagen-group-vyibrala-programmnoe-obespechenie-mirantis-openstack-dlya-svoego-oblaka-sleduyushhego-pokoleniya/">about this project</a> , right? <br><br>  On Thursday, April 28, a <a href="https://www.openstack.org/summit/austin-2016/summit-schedule/events/8607">G-Core company case</a> will be presented to transfer part of the Wargaming infrastructure from VMware to OpenStack.  We also managed to tell <a href="https://www.mirantis.ru/company-news/news-company/g-core-i-mirantis-openstack-perevedut-v-oblako-chast-it-infrastrukturyi-proektov-wargaming/">this story</a> to all interested readers in Russian. <br><br>  So, three cases, three industries - telecom, car production and multiplayer online games.  By the way, video of the main presentations, as a rule, become available on the summit page the next day after their presentation, and program reports are often broadcast in real time. <br><br>  If you suddenly go to the summit, then take note: the organizing committee, as always, has released a mobile application for planning time.  The application is available for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/openstack-foundation-summit/id1071261846%3Fmt%3D8">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dorg.openstack.android.summit">Android devices</a> .  Mentally recommend to use.  And do not forget to take a stroll through the ‚ÄúVanity Fair‚Äù - the exhibition area is becoming more and more spectacular with each half year, and souvenirs, surprises and gifts are more expensive.  Our booth is A41, and we have prepared something exceptional for our guests!  Come on the light! <br><br>  As for the purely technical part of the program, everything is as usual: containers (where can they be without them?), Big data, IT infrastructure management, application development and management, and even a bit of the Internet of things (IoT).  We will try to keep you up to date with our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MirantisIT/">Russian-language Facebook account</a> and English-language <a href="https://twitter.com/MirantisIT">Twitter account</a> , and, according to the results of the summit, we will probably start a separate blog post. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/282073/">https://habr.com/ru/post/282073/</a></p>
