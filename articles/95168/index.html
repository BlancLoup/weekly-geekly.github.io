  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What should be improved in the Post of Russia</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently I began to actively use the services of the Post of Russia and, like many here, I was not satisfied with the quality of work of this state institution.  But I tried not to list all the negative things that each of us, based on personal experience, can tell the public.  I just tried to structure my thoughts on what and how best to learn from the experience of other similar organizations on the example of Correos and Deutsche Post ‚Äî the postal services of Spain and Germany, respectively. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><h4>  Recognizability </h4><br>  The brands Correos and Deutsche Post are recognizable.  If you were, for example, in Madrid and Munich, then on the streets (most often in those where people walk, that is, central or streaming) noticed yellow post <a href="">pedestals</a> .  In cities, smaller, wall boxes of the same yellow eye-catching flowers are used. <br>  <i>Problem</i> : mailboxes in Moscow are invisible.  Most often you have to scour in search of the box to send.  And it‚Äôs not a fact that the letter thrown into it will be transmitted to the addressee (I have this in mind, not far from the metro station Dynamo). <br>  <b>Solution</b> : let people know where they can send correspondence.  To place bright boxes at important transport hubs (exits from the subway, bus and railway stations), at large shopping and business centers.  In other words - you need to go to customers, tell them that they can use this service. <br><br><h4>  Payment </h4><br>  Postage is most often paid by stamps.  In Spain, brands are used with a value of, for example, ‚Ç¨ 0.34, ‚Ç¨ 0.45, ‚Ç¨ 0.64, and others with a seemingly ‚Äúnon-standard‚Äù price. <br>  <i>Problem</i> : the presence of standard price stamps at post offices (0.15-0.5 kopecks, 1-100 rubles).  When you send a registered letter up to 20 grams, its <a href="http://www.russianpost.ru/rp/servise/ru/home/postuslug/lettercorrespondence/local">cost</a> is 24.15 rubles (excluding VAT).  This means that you will be glued (if you yourself have not stuck and with the presence of appropriate marks) 2x10 rubles, 2x2 rubles, 1x0.15 marks, i.e.  5 items.  Is this price convenient and the process of sticking?  By the way, the cost of sticking - 5 rubles. <br>  <b>Solution</b> : availability of stamps with a price for sending a certain type of correspondence.  It seems to me convenient not to wonder how much it costs to send a registered letter in stamps, but simply to buy a stamp for a registered letter.  If the price changes, it does not greatly affect the brand - they can also be used, because their value has not fallen, only the convenience of their use has decreased.  Naturally, pricing policy should take this issue into account too. <br>  In this case, stamps in Moscow can be bought only in the department.  In Madrid, brands are also sold in tobacco shops.  Which is always convenient, because they are enough throughout the city.

    <h4>  Social significance </h4><br>  In Germany, a postal worker is not just an employee, he is a person who plays an important social role.  He is given a <a href="">form</a> , if necessary - a vehicle (most often a bicycle with a sidecar).  This person is the link between the addressee and the institution. <br>  <i>Problem</i> : lack of understanding of the importance of this service.  It turned out that the postmen are not personified (the postman got sick - there is no one to deliver the mail), their needs for the same wheelchairs are not satisfied (so, the postman did not deliver correspondence to us, because she couldn‚Äôt drag off all the letters bought the stroller - delivery started faster). <br>  <b>Solution</b> : closer integration in the life of the city and residents, inviting university students to work related to topics (for example, MTUCI) with benefits for them, social advertising, improving the quality of work. <br><br>  In conclusion, I would like to say that the problems I have listed and their solutions are not the only and correct ones.  Of course, it is very difficult to rebuild such a large organization as Russian Post quickly.  However, we all feel an urgent need for the client-orientation of this organization, otherwise it loses its essence.  However, there is no current alternative to PR. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/95168/">https://habr.com/ru/post/95168/</a></p>
