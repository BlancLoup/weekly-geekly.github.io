Nevertheless, it takes a lot of effort, time and money to support the work of all this variety of government resources.  For this reason, the government began discussing the possibility of reorganizing the system of official websites of ministries and departments.  One of the proposed solutions is the closure of those sites that did not manage to gain popularity among users, and the translation of services ‚Äúunder the wing‚Äù of a single portal, RBC <a href="https://www.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/22/12/2017/5a3a6b8a9a79470d0525805b">writes</a> . <br><br>  There are other scenarios.  For example, it is proposed to preserve the existing websites of state bodies, but to develop a unified development strategy, as well as common principles for organizing user interfaces and data to be placed.  In this case, it also provides for the creation of a unified state portal that will interact with individual resources of federal authorities to implement the principle of ‚Äúone window‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The concept of the work of state sites in June 2017 was entrusted by the head of government Dmitry Medvedev.  It should be noted that in the presence of thousands of public websites about 71% of Russian citizens cannot answer which resource they will use to solve a certain range of tasks.

      According to experts, subject to the availability of uniform standards, it will be possible to reduce the cost of designing and developing such sites, re-entering data, accessing and storing this data.  Reducing costs will also allow the closure of unpopular resources whose attendance is below the required level.  The cost of maintaining the existing and creating new information systems of the federal level in 2016 amounted to 39.36 billion rubles.  Sites of departments are also taken into account in these statistics, however, data on how much the authorities spend on these resources are not disclosed. <br><br>  According to the Deputy Minister of Communications and Mass Media, Alexei Kozyrev, in the middle of next month, the Ministry of Communications and the ‚Äúopen government‚Äù together plan to launch the industrial page of their new version of the gov.ru portal.  In February of next year, a beta version with test services will be released.  The new site can be used to solve a wide range of tasks, including expert discussions of draft laws that are now being held in person. <br><br>  As mentioned above, almost all the scenarios for the further development of public resources allocated by the officials provide for a single portal on the gov.ru domain.  This domain name is registered with the Federal Guard Service of Russia (FSO).  According to Kozyrev, negotiations are now under way to delegate this domain, although the FSO itself has not commented on this statement. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAccording to various estimates, out of 7,000 websites of state bodies that are currently developing in Russia, 80% are not widely attended, but the money is still spent on them.  We want to close such resources, transfer their content to the unified gov.ru platform and leave only sites where most of the traffic accumulates, ‚ÄùKozyrev said.  From the beginning of next year, a specialized rating will be created to control the popularity of government resources, which will help navigate the diversity of government websites. <br><br>  The concept of development of state resources still needs to be approved by the government subcommittee on the digital economy, a working group under the leadership of Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich, as well as a government commission under the leadership of Minister Mikhail Abyzov.  Kozyrev said that the document will be approved no later than mid-January. <br><br>  As for the design concept of state sites, they were prepared by a whole group of developers, which includes AIC and the studio of Artyom Geller.  This work was carried out on a voluntary basis. <br><br>  Rostelecom will be developing the updated version of Gov.ru.  Among other areas of site refinement is the use of a weak form of AI for effective analysis of user requests, partial processing of calls and written requests.  For these purposes it is planned to spend from 671.1 million to 772.3 million rubles. <br><br>  Gov.ru will be governed by the same documents as Gosuslugi.ru.  In fact, one state-owned digital platform will use two domains, gosuslugi.ru and gov.ru, ‚Äùthe Ministry of Communications and Mass Communications said.  Kozyrev estimates investment in the development of Gov.ru at 200 million rubles.  in year.  According to the official, these funds will pay off in the first year, if you stop spending money on "stillborn" portals. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/356252/">https://habr.com/ru/post/356252/</a></p>
