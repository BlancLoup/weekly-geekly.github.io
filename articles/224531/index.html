How to use non-administrative techniques?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c74/ee0/0c7/c74ee00c761704a2e7bce83091c4aafd.jpg" align="left">  Colleagues, we are glad to inform you that, despite the political intrigues, the guys from Kharkov will again light up with a new <a href="http://devconf.ru/offers/mk">master class at DevConf 2014</a> . <br><br>  We bring to your attention - an interview with the leading master class: <br>  - Dmitry Snisar.  Psychologist (specialization: psychology of communication) and trainer (2000+ students, 2500+ training hours).  The last three years - working with people from IT. <br>  - Vladimir Zheleznyak.  Programmer, manager, consultant.  15 years in commercial IT.  He worked in grocery and outsourcing projects. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>- Tell a few words about yourself?</b> <br>  On the project " <a href="http://it-boost.com/">Psychology in IT</a> " we work together, so the answer here will also be of two parts: <br><br>  <b><i>Dima</i></b> : I am a psychologist.  I specialize in communication, negotiation, motivation.  I came to IT three years ago, now I‚Äôm working to help techies understand better and use those bagofichs that every humanoid, other people have and learn how to easily achieve their goal.

      <b><i>Volodya</i></b> : I'm an IT person.  The same techie that Dima was talking about.  I've been in IT for 15 years in different roles, and I have something to remember.  Sometimes, it comes to the ridiculous ... For example, a superspecial timlide can spend five hours without stopping to talk about the features and limitations of eight different databases.  But at the same time, if someone from the subordinates works poorly, then the timlid knows only two ways to fix it - take a bigger cake (yeah, who will) or a bigger stick (fines, too, somehow not very). <br><br>  <b>- Can you say a few words about your report besides what is in the description?</b> <br>  <b><i>Volodya</i></b> : The theme of punishments and rewards is she sick.  A lot of attempts, the same KPI over the past five years, who just did not implement and did not kick.  Gamification is now in trend.  For me there are a couple of interesting points: <br><br>  If, until now, no single model of motivation has definitely won, then they are all with great flaws.  Or, at least, they are not transferred from one company to another.  Remember how git came - a few years passed, and svn remained only in reserves.  With motivational approaches, this did not happen. <br><br>  If an employee behaves badly - I, as a last resort, will dismiss him.  And if the child?  I have three of them, I know. <br><br>  <b><i>Dima</i></b> : Scientific psychology has accumulated a lot of experimental data and hypotheses that help to understand what is happening in a person's head: what pushes him to work, and what - pushes him.  For example, we are talking about reward and punishment, but even behaviorism (which turned almost 100 years old) effectively worked with eight behavioral correction techniques.  And they were all tested in thousands of experiments, from mice to humans, inclusive.  Over the past fifty years, social psychology has conducted tens of thousands of experiments only in the topics we have been discussing.  In the past decade, the behavioral economy (which deals not so much with economic relations as with people building up their behavior in economic relations) has greatly advanced.  And the development of neuroimaging methods in recent years has allowed neurobiology to start doing research in this topic.  And all these disciplines are developing, and the amount of data is just hell even for a specialist.  In the report and the MC we will try to summarize the views of the behavioral sciences on punishment and encouragement plus tell useful experiments for practice.  Especially on the practical side, we would like the MK and the report to be primarily practical, not scientific.  And, as a psychologist is very useful to own a computer, and a technician is useful to possess psychological knowledge and skills. <br><br>  <b>- To whom is your workshop oriented?</b> <br>  First of all - for those who grew up as managers from technical specialists.  At the same time, the formal status of a ‚Äúmanager‚Äù may not be, it is enough to hear at least once something like ‚Äúhere you are new, Bob, he will help you‚Äù or ‚Äúask the customer directly ‚Äî he will be faster‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>- What will the new listener of your master class learn?</b> <br>  At the master class, we will tell about interesting experiments and facts in the balance of encouragement-punishment.  Let's briefly run through different ways of punishment - what can you do if you have no rights? <br><br>  But at the master class we will go to practice.  Those.  the theory will also be there - but immediately after it we will analyze the real cases from life and try to apply new techniques in practice. <br><br><h4>  <b>Before DevConf 2014 - only 2 weeks left - we will meet there!</b> </h4></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/224531/">https://habr.com/ru/post/224531/</a></p>
