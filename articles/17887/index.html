The release date of Windows Vista was repeatedly postponed, and the whole OS development process took more than five years.  With the advent of Windows 7, the release schedule for the next version of Windows is expected to become more predictable.  Microsoft, in particular, plans to maintain the same time intervals between the announcement of the next versions of the software platform.  About Windows 7 is not yet known too much.  It is reported only that the operating system will be released in client and server versions and will support both 64-bit and 32-bit processors.  Microsoft has confirmed that the corporation is considering the possibility of introducing a subscription model on Windows, but so far there are no details about this OS distribution scheme.  Recently, Microsoft announced the exact release date for the new Windows Server 2008 server operating system. The software platform is expected to be officially unveiled at a special event to be held in Los Angeles on February 27 of next year.  Simultaneously with Windows Server 2008, SQL Server 2008 database and Visual Studio 2008 application development environment will be announced. <br>  Microsoft announced that the next Windows 7 operating system, previously known under the codename Windows Vienna, will appear in 2010.  In addition, the corporation said that from now on they will observe a 3-year development cycle of desktop operating systems. <br><br>  Recall that the software giant came under a wave of harsh criticism about a year ago due to the fact that the development of the desktop OS Windows Vista was hopelessly delayed, and its predecessor Windows XP was released more than 6 years ago.

      According to Microsoft Operations Director Kevin Turner, all major Windows releases will be released every three years, in special cases the process can be extended to 4 years, the normal Windows server development cycle will be 4 years, the same goes for Microsoft Office .  In addition, a maximum of every 2 years, the corporation has pledged to release for the supported operating systems significant upgrade sets, affecting some architectural changes. <br><br>  As for Windows 7, as well as Windows Vista it will be released in two editions - 32-bit and 64-bit.  In addition, for Windows 7, a fundamentally new system operation can be implemented - by subscription, which needs to be renewed at certain intervals, however, under this item, the corporation does not yet have a specific plan and the current ‚Äúboxed‚Äù license system can still be saved. <br><br>  Recall that Microsoft representatives have long and repeatedly said that the development of the corporation will sooner or later be transferred to the subscription licensing system.  From the point of view of the corporation, this model is more profitable, because, first of all, everyone will pay for using the OS, and secondly, they will most likely pay annually.  For users, the profitability or disadvantage will directly depend on the size of the payment. <br><br>  At the same time, the company still has a number of customers who, as part of their paid subscriptions, can download and use various products of the company free of charge.  These clients, as a rule, are companies from the sphere of large business, which make it easier to issue one subscription than to pay for each copy.  However, according to surveys of Forrester Research, a research company, even among large customers, the corporation‚Äôs subscription system is not very popular, and most companies, having bought it once in most cases, do not renew it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/17887/">https://habr.com/ru/post/17887/</a></p>
