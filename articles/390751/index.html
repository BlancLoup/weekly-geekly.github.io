    <h2>  Foreword </h2><br>  For the third year in a series of Internet of Things ( <i><b>approx.</b> The Internet of Things or simply IoT</i> ) becomes the main topic at CES ( <i><b>approx. The</b> last one was held in January 2016</i> ).  More than 900 companies from 3800 who took part in this show, addressed their products to the Internet of Things.  Many company representatives say this: ‚ÄúIoT is experiencing a real boom now, turning from a dream into a reality.‚Äù <br><br>  However, there are dissenters.  So, for example, Andrew Tarantola (Andrew Tarantola) from <a href="http://www.engadget.com/">Engadget</a> thinks that ‚ÄúIoT is mired in smart lamps connected via Internet cameras and wireless speakers.  We saw the same small technique even when the term itself was just introduced into circulation. ‚Äù  Pam Baker from <a href="http://www.fiercebigdata.com/">FierceBigData</a> also complains: ‚ÄúIoT data processing products work again and again at full capacity, many, frankly, do not cope, and the same problems with a huge flow of data from devices remain unsolved.‚Äù <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/360/3b8/74a/3603b874abfb4a1fa0adeab13c61d6e8.png"></a> <br>  <a href="http://iot-analytics.com/10-internet-of-things-applications/">A source</a> <br><br>  <i>So what is the current state of IoT and where is it going?</i>  <i>Summary information and forecasts from leading analytical companies <a href="https://www.forrester.com/home/">Forrester</a> , <a href="https://machinaresearch.com/">Machina Research</a> , <a href="http://www.weforum.org/">the World Economic Forum (WEF)</a> , <a href="http://www.gartner.com/technology/home.jsp">Gartner</a> and <a href="https://www.idc.com/">IDC are</a> presented on the CWPP.</i>  <i>Below are detailed forecasts.</i> <br><br><h2>  Forrester Forecasts </h2><br>  In a new report for <a href="http://www.techradar.com/">TechRadar</a> , Forrester claims that "IoT technologies are, by and large, diverse and immature."  Most of the 19 IoT technologies are defined in the report as currently in the ‚ÄúSurvival and Growth‚Äù stage.  The development of standards and the creation of a reliable security system are the key to their success: ‚ÄúStandards are still in their infancy, as sellers have been dealing with this issue for only a couple of years.  And the security technologies in IoT are still in the development stage without being used in specific products. ‚Äù <br><br>  Forrester says that IoT is a ‚Äúbusiness trend,‚Äù while the report says that 23% of companies are already using IoT, and 29% plan to use it next year.  They, companies and firms, use IoT to transform their business model, moving from one-time product operations to <a href="http://www.seecontrol.com/what-is-product-as-a-service/">product-as-a-service</a> relationships and optimizing the use of physical and financial resources, as well as creating new forms of attracting users and customers. <br><br>  In the forecast for 2016, Forrester saw the following in his magic ball: <br><ul><li>  At least one company will train Wall Street investors on how to trace the evolution from product to revenue from services.  For example, Adobe and Microsoft have already switched to selling software as a service ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service">software-as-a-service, SaaS</a> ); </li><li>  Corporate customers and consumers will automatically ask the sellers about the capabilities of the sensors in the mobile application of the product when purchasing a new machine or refrigerator; </li><li>  One or more companies will report the number of connected products they use in working with customers, as well as the number of connected customers; </li><li>  IoT will create huge amounts of time series data and its analytics will become a specialized discipline in data analysis; </li><li>  Insurance companies may begin to promote special types of insurance (discounted) for smart homes; </li><li>  10% of drivers will use "apssessoris" ("appcessories", <i><b>note:</b> "in Russian it will sound like accessories"</i> ) - devices for cars with access to the network via a smartphone, which will allow to introduce new technologies into relatively old cars. </li></ul><br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3e1/4b5/f4b/3e14b5f4b5cb4e5c8c0ee7ff67aa6160.jpg"></a> <br>  <a href="https://bensontao.wordpress.com/2013/10/06/vivante-internet-of-things/">A source</a> <br><br><h2>  Machina Research Forecasts </h2><br><ul><li>  We will feel the first heartbeat of the new IoT economy and the shift from selling products to providing services.  So at least one <a href="http://fortune.com/fortune500/">Fortune 500</a> company will completely change its perception of profit and trade based on the data generated by IoT; </li><li>  Pushing through IoT will affect higher levels of company management.  At least one <a href="http://fortune.com/fortune500/">Fortune 500</a> company will hire a top-level executive over the Internet of Things; </li><li>  Corrective analytics ‚Äî as a security option for automatically adjusting settings based on actual results in real time, rather than actions that are not predicted in advance ‚Äî will be a fail-safe and secure approach for a number of sectors; </li><li>  The nominal name in IoT will be ‚Äúbankruptcy‚Äù, while at least one company will be bought at a price that is 100 times more than revenue; </li><li>  At least one of the core technologies of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPWAN">Low-Power, Wide-Area (LPWA)</a> will become redundant, and technologies in general will become more and more fragmented; </li><li>  Chinese players will shake up the IoT landscape by expanding and significantly busy increasing market share in areas such as semiconductors, software platforms, deploying intelligent cities, and, especially, integrated solutions; </li><li>  Digital twins and digital avatars will breed, real-world virtualization will be an incredibly popular technology, and augmented reality will come out of its niche and be more widely used; </li><li>  We are not expecting any meaningful commercial implementations of IoT that are based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_chain_(database)">Blockchain</a> ; </li><li>  At least one main IoT player will face face to face with significant regulatory issues. </li></ul><br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b1c/b01/dde/b1cb01dde6014421ba9d76ea4f463740.jpg"></a> <br>  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/asian-internet-things-strategic-forum-1032016-singapore-yoga-j">A source</a> <br><br><h2>  Forecasts from the World Economic Forum (WEF) </h2><br>  The International Economic Forum (WEF) surveyed 800 market leaders and found out their opinion on 21 turning points of IoT, that is, moments when specific technological changes reached the foundations of society.
