And he does it, uh-uh ... how can I put it more softly, rudely? <br><br>  <a href="http://www.ctc-tv.ru/">CTC</a> channel has its own PR-service, whose tasks include viral marketing.  By viral marketing, they understand the passions in forums and guest pages. <br><br>  On the sites they leave entries competently from a technical point of view: <br>  - come from different IP (or transfer different IP to the processing script), <br>  - try to write at different times (or transmit different times to the processing script).

      But this is an attempt not to get hooked on the moderator.  Because the themes, characters, and language that are written in guestbooks and forums are primitive, and this gives them away. <br><br>  It seems to be strange: the CTC channel creates good series, writes quite good scripts, has scriptwriters on staff, could even create virtual characters smarter. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To make the picture clearer, I give the last example.  The channel is now the most rated series "Ranetki" (January 2009).  The group of the same name is filmed there.  A soloist Lera left her a month ago, and it‚Äôs known that she was in an amorous relationship with the producer, and then they broke up.  Well, parted and parted, what to do, everything in life happens.  But this is a topic for viral marketing!  Messages appear on the forums: <br><br> <code> !   !   ! <br>  !   ,     . <br>      : <br>        ,   .       ,  .           , ??  ? ,     -       . <br>  ,     .      .   .  ,    :)   ,    .      :) <br> <br>       "". <br>       <br> <br>        <br> <br>   !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br> !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br> <br> ,   ?    ? ,!!! <br> <br> ,          ,        .            . ,               .     .</code> <br> <br>  Well, and so on.  This is the beginning.  Then the PR service decides to add fuel to the fire.  A new character appears, set up negatively: <br><br> <code>  !  !!!!!!!!!!!!! <br> <br>     !!!!!!!!!! <br> <br> !      !!!!!!!!!!!</code> <br> <br>  And then another aggressive character appears, already against the previous one: <br><br> <code>          !   ! <br> <br>            !</code> <br> <br>  This is the kind of atmosphere that PR people create.  And they are absolutely sure that this is viral marketing.  In fact, this activity has nothing to do with viral marketing.  This is just an information provocation, and only (thanks for the hint <a href="http://ant99.habrahabr.ru/">ant99</a> ).  But what goal?  Provocation provocation?  And then provocation provocation provocation? <br><br>  Recently, I am moderating one regional forum of the JTS.  How do I determine that these records are from PR people, not real users?  Elementary: <br>  - If I delete some records quickly enough, they appear word for word after a couple of days.  Apparently PR managers do not keep records of where and what they wrote. <br>  - Records appear in series of 5-6 pieces for 15 minutes, and then a break for 2-3 days. <br>  - Attempts to disguise under different writing styles are very primitive and constantly repeated.  This is a separate and interesting topic that I've been following for a long time: just like every person has his own handwriting, each has his own style of writing in the forums. <br>  - All words in the entries are written correctly!  Not a single mistake in me!  But punctuation errors are made deliberately diverse. <br>  - The time is real and the time that is passed into the form is different. <br>  - And most importantly: the tone of all the messages is absolutely the same.  Apparently some one character was made up, and this character is terrible: a kind of 12-13 year old hysteric, watching TV from morning to evening, not politically correct, cocky, primitive, aggressive-minded, unable to respect someone else's point of view. <br><br>  The last item is key.  We agree that, indeed, there are such characters on the net.  But does STS really want to see its only public?  After all, through the guest and forums, the JTS tries to form an opinion about its public, creates a certain background.  Let's think, does one normal person want to get involved in communication in such an atmosphere?  PR service is actually pushing out real fans from the communication area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Internet audience. <br><br>  I myself recently ran into a problem: I am interested in the ‚Äú6 frames‚Äù project and pretty much climbed on forums and guest pages.  And everywhere I come across a depressing picture.  Everything is filled with the same messages, empty and negatively emotional. <br><br>  The <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B3">Wikipedia</a> article on <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B3">trolling is</a> well-written, that a troll that receives power in a forum actually closes it.  The CTS PR-service itself methodically closes all forms and guestbooks, creating a trolling machine. <br><br>  I felt this by moderating my own forum.  He has long been empty.  No one comes to him except for PR people every 2-3 days for 15 minutes.  They create an intolerable atmosphere and disappear with a sense of accomplishment. <br><br><h4>  What conclusions can be drawn? </h4><br>  Of course, the first conclusion that begs: TV copywriters are stupid, and we, Internet copywriters, are smart.  But that would be too easy. <br><br>  Therefore, I want to draw other conclusions: <br><br><ol><li>  If you have a forum or a collective blog, and you want to pretend that you have the movement, do not try to write for different characters alone - each person has his own style, and the falsity will be quickly revealed.  Enlist the support of friends or acquaintances who are also interested in the topic, and write together. </li><li>  If you create virtual characters, on behalf of whom you are going to write, then think first what kind of personalities you want to see.  What mood you want to come to you.  And then write, following the portrait. </li><li>  If you decide to create virtual characters, try to make them as positive, smart, and interesting as possible. </li><li>  Be prepared for the fact that your virtuals will open.  Honestly and apologize. </li><li>  Trolls are on the Internet, but they can not be fed.  And even more so they should not be created as virtual characters. </li><li>  Look for ways not to create virtual characters at all. </li></ol></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/47660/">https://habr.com/ru/post/47660/</a></p>
