Recently, the official PocketBook blog on ‚ÄúHabr√©‚Äù published a <a href="https://habr.com/company/pocketbook/blog/421545/">review of the</a> younger model of the end of 2018 line - PocketBook 616. Now it‚Äôs the turn of the reader, which is in the table of ranks one row higher.  It's about <a href="http://pocketbook.ru/shop/ustroystva/pocketbook-627-chernyy/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_content%3D627%26utm_campaign%3Dsep2018">PocketBook 627</a> .  This is a middle class model with a set of options, which, in my opinion, will be enough for about 90% of reader users.  Yes, there is a PocketBook 632, which is even steeper, but it a) will appear on sale only towards the end of September and b) is intended for particularly violent perfectionists.  Well, that is, it has everything that you can think of.  But in PocketBook 627 there is not everything, but a lot.  And this much, I think, will be enough for the overwhelming majority of fans of electronic reading. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sy/vl/np/syvlnpq2rk3zga-aekttxidtizw.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  About the new PocketBook line of the end of 2018 </h2><br>  I duplicate information from the review of PocketBook 616, because I believe that it should be recalled about the common features of the three new readers - models 616, 627 and 632. <br><br><ul><li>  In all three new readers the emphasis is on reducing the size.  Each of them is about 20% more compact than the predecessor model of the previous generation. </li><li>  All three new readers thoroughly "screwed" power consumption.  And tests show that they are no longer working ‚Äúfor about a month,‚Äù but ‚Äúfor about one and a half months.‚Äù  More precisely, not so: PocketBook 616 and PocketBook 627 give six weeks, and PocketBook 632 - up to eight weeks.  This is because the flagship model received the same economical dual-core processor as the <a href="https://habr.com/company/pocketbook/blog/410359/">PocketBook 740</a> . </li><li>  All three readers demonstrate an increase in speed.  In some situations, about two times, but in most cases an approximately 50 percent increase is noticeable. </li></ul><br><h2>  Comparison of PocketBook 627 and PocketBook 626 Plus </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3g/bk/ba/3gbkbahsgdqer5sbjarpukx2suw.png">

    <h2>  Impressions of PocketBook 627 </h2><br>  This time I decided to move away from the standard scheme with subsections, which describe in detail ‚Äúdesign‚Äù, ‚Äúscreen‚Äù, ‚Äúsoft‚Äù, ‚Äúbattery‚Äù and other components of the device, and just write what I liked in the new reader with specific examples and arguments .  Considering that I have been using PocketBook readers for the last 6 years, and now I own PocketBook 626 Plus, my point of view might be useful for potential buyers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sy/vl/np/syvlnpq2rk3zga-aekttxidtizw.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/b9/ec/ti/b9ecticfjkraumxemth-w-4qetg.jpeg"><br><br>  The first thing that is important to understand is that PocketBook 627 is actually <b>much more compact</b> than the PocketBook 626 Plus 2015 model.  The developers did the same thing as many now produce smartphones.  And they, I remind, to the maximum reduce the frame around the screen and get, say, a 6-inch smartphone, which is not larger than 5.5-inch with more massive frames.  So with PocketBook 627, everything is the same: the frames around the screen have become significantly smaller, the block with buttons has also been reduced - and it turned out that the new product is 14 mm shorter and 7 mm already predecessor.  And besides, it is also 25 grams lighter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ul/ue/km/uluekmvkt1aw9rxwinkviexn-so.jpeg"><br><br>  In practice, all this has greatly <b>improved ergonomics</b> .  Well, just much more comfortable to read with a lighter and narrower device - the reader still often has to hold in your hand for hours on end.  And against the background of PocketBook 627, the PocketBook 626 Plus model looks ... well, so-so, outdated and quite a big thing. <br><br>  For example, PocketBook 627 can easily be placed in a pocket of shorts or jeans, but the PocketBook 626 Plus will not fit there.  And if you fit, then you will feel somehow awkward. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dp/1h/h7/dp1hh71ddtkldzhhxhe51tpvgf8.jpeg"><br><br>  Let me give you another example from life.  The wife has an old PocketBook 515 2013 with an ancient 5-inch screen and no backlight.  I have repeatedly suggested that she use my PocketBook 626 Plus for reading.  But for her it is too big.  It‚Äôs just that the wife‚Äôs hand is very, um, compact, and therefore she sat on her mammoth 515. But PocketBook 627 interested her.  He says it is quite convenient to keep him.  That, however, is not surprising.  The 6-inch PocketBook 627, of course, is somewhat larger than the PocketBook 615 with its 5 inches, and yet the dimensions of the models are quite comparable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/a-/rx/hu/a-rxhuateir6ohxmtcjd-yng09w.jpeg"><br>  <i>Wife with PocketBook 515 (right) and PocketBook 627, which may replace 515</i> <br><br>  <b>Buttons</b> on PocketBook 627 are noticeably smaller than on PocketBook 626 Plus.  I can not say that ergonomics because of this deteriorated.  On the keys, anyway, from the first attempt you get your fingers, and generally it‚Äôs more convenient for me to manage the reader and scroll the pages from the display.  And he has a PocketBook 627, as you already know from the table, touch. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ga/h3/mz/gah3mzpwtdcnmuwm0yqj7uhkou8.jpeg"><br><br>  In general, everything related to the case of the PocketBook 627 is better than the previous model.  Both the ergonomics, and the dimensions, and even the materials - the novelty of the front and the back panels are made of velvety plastic, and not just the back.  At PocketBook 626 Plus, the front part, I remind you, is solid. <br><br>  I can‚Äôt say anything bad about the <b>screen</b> - yes, it has not changed compared to PocketBook 626 Plus.  The same E Ink Carta, 6 inches, 1024 x 758 pixels, touch capacitive layer, white monochromatic backlight.  In general, high-quality display E Ink last generation.  Looks like a printed book.  The sun does not go blind, the fonts are clearly displayed, the battery charge eats without any appetite. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ng/hl/rn/nghlrndo5b3yw9pjnwwudea38pm.jpeg"><br><br>  By the way, about this appetite: practice has shown that PocketBook 627 will indeed be more <b>autonomous</b> than PocketBook 626 Plus.  For two weeks of reading with a low (30 percent) level of backlighting and Wi-Fi turned off, the PocketBook 627 model loses one third of the battery charge, and the PocketBook 626 Plus loses one half.  If you scale this data for a longer period, then it will turn out that the new reader will have to be charged once a month and a half, and the old one will ask for the outlet once a month. <br><br>  <b>The speed of work has grown</b> - and this is striking, even without measurements.  After testing the PocketBook 627, I returned to my personal PocketBook 626 Plus, and I didn‚Äôt experience any particular joy.  Indeed, it doesn‚Äôt inspire much when you‚Äôve gotten used to the fact that a device takes a second (or five seconds) to act on one device or another, and then you change to another device that spends two seconds on the same thing (or ten respectively).  PocketBook 627 opens PDF much faster, loads websites in a browser faster, and pages also turn over faster. <br><br>  <b>The</b> PocketBook 627 <b>browser is</b> completely new - it a) quickly, b) is able to open complex resources without any problems and, most importantly, c) it can save sites that are then available offline as a kind of book.  In short, you can download to the reader via Wi-Fi, say, a pack of articles from Wikipedia, and then read them from the E Ink screen where there is no Internet.  I, for example, downloaded several posts from Habr in PocketBook 627.  Here's what it looks like: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sj/3z/hn/sj3zhn6pk-7o_bs38ba_0fvkx04.jpeg" width="390"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ty/1f/hm/ty1fhm0efmkbul92cbrzqqlvkaq.jpeg" width="390"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sz/gk/gi/szgkgixygqw1ubttifjotn3ce0o.jpeg" width="390"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/td/7e/_l/td7e_ltdlbvmjpbaagzjs5yomna.jpeg" width="390"><br><br>  Well, and more PocketBook 627 supports <b>PocketBook Cloud</b> - a cloud service for synchronizing books and reading positions between readers and smartphones, tablets, laptops.  He first appeared in the flagship model <a href="https://habr.com/company/pocketbook/blog/410359/">PocketBook 740</a> , then with the firmware update added to <a href="https://habr.com/company/pocketbook/blog/408639/">PocketBook 631 Plus</a> and <a href="https://habr.com/company/pocketbook/blog/369819/">PocketBook 631</a> .  Well, PocketBook 627, therefore, the first reader of a middle-class company with this service.  I myself do not read from smartphones / tablets, but I know that there are plenty of such people - who use both poketbooks and smartphones for reading.  For example, at home people read from readers, and in the subway - from smarts.  And for them PocketBook Cloud will definitely be a useful chip.  Read more about this cloud-based service in a <a href="https://habr.com/company/pocketbook/blog/410525/">separate post</a> on Habre. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/f_/np/f4/f_npf4yf0gbwwhd4gvw5p9iebuu.jpeg"><br><br>  Everything described above is the difference between PocketBook 627 and PocketBook 626 Plus.  Otherwise, all the advantages remained in place: a bunch of supported book formats (18 pieces), a lot of ways to load books into the reader (Dropbox, e-mail, BookLand.com), a lot of settings for text, dictionaries with the ability to translate the selected word in the text. <br><br>  Plus <b>a two-year warranty or even three years</b> , if you buy a reader directly from PocketBook - in the online store pocketbook.ru.  I told about all this in posts more than once or twice, and therefore now I just briefly mentioned it, having decided not to annoy too much. <br><br><h2>  As output </h2><br>  I can‚Äôt say that after becoming acquainted with PocketBook 627 I just wanted to throw my personal PocketBook 626 Plus out the window and run to the store for a novelty (or rather, go after it on pocketbook.ru - there only three years of an official guarantee, and in a regular store "Only" two).  But if right now there was a choice between two models, then I would not even look at the old one.  It is larger, heavier, slower, less battery powered, does not support PocketBook Cloud.  And PocketBook 627, therefore, is smaller, easier, faster, more autonomous and works with the cloud service.  And it costs only 1,000 rubles more expensive - 10,900 rubles versus 9,900 rubles.  The fact is that in some places PocketBook 626 Plus is still found - these are the remnants that sell for 9,900 rubles.  It is not worth buying a 2015 model, even if it is time-tested and generally good.  Even if it is 1 000 cheaper - after all, the reader is not a smartphone, it is bought not for a year or two, but more often for five or six years.  So an extra thousand rubles is only +200 rubles for the whole year as comfortable, technological and, most importantly, as healthy as possible. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dk/ea/cg/dkeacg0yiuyguz1f-8lduqdiewq.jpeg"><br><br>  Model <a href="http://pocketbook.ru/shop/ustroystva/pocketbook-627-chernyy/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_content%3D627%26utm_campaign%3Dsep2018">PocketBook 627</a> turned out very cool.  And, by the way, it is perfectly suitable for the role of a female reader - due to its low weight and compact size.  If the wife strongly insists (I think, yes, as we say in Odessa), replace her PocketBook 515 with PocketBook 627. <br><br>  If you have questions about the hero of this post - ask in the comments! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/422257/">https://habr.com/ru/post/422257/</a></p>
