  <section class="page js-page"><h1>School hh.ru programmers for the 10th time opens a set of IT specialists</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  Hello!  Summer is not only a time for holidays, vacations and other nishtyakov, but it‚Äôs also a good time to think about learning.  The training itself, which will teach the most popular programming languages, will ‚Äúpump‚Äù skills, immerse real business projects into solutions, and, of course, will launch a successful career.  Yes, you all understood correctly - we will speak about our School of Programmers.  Under the cut I will tell about the results of the 9th edition and the beginning of the set in the 10th. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tm/hl/tj/tmhltjtt6hiastzfxepty7xjokk.jpeg"></p><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  <em>First, let me remind you that the most motivated and persistent programmers who have successfully completed the course and passed the exams are ready to start working in IT companies and IT departments.</em> </p><br><h2 id="kak-poyavilas-shkola-programmistov-hhru">  How did the School of Programmers hh.ru </h2><br><p>  The work of such a high-load and constantly growing service, like hh.ru, is provided by a team of strong IT specialists - we have something to teach beginners and anyone who plans to build a career in development.  Not only in theory, but also the main thing - in practice of launching real business projects hh.ru.  The main mission of the project is to help beginners (or changing their field of activity) IT professionals with great potential to find an excellent place to work. </p><br><p>  At the same time, like any large IT company, HeadHunter always needs an influx of new developers.  Back in 2010, we realized that the best way to create a personnel reserve in IT is to organize our own <a href="https://school.hh.ru/">School of Programmers</a> .  In 2011, the first set and the first release took place.  Since then, the school annually opens the door to a new stream of students. </p><br><h2 id="kak-popast-v-shkolu-programmistov-i-chto-ona-daet">  How to get to the School of programmers and what it gives </h2><br><p>  Education in the <a href="https://school.hh.ru/">School of Programmers is</a> free, and in order to get into it, you need to pass a serious competitive selection: a test task and an in-person interview.  To solve the problems of the test, you do not need to be a programming pro, but you need to think well. </p><br><p>  Our ideal candidate for admission passed the course Computer Science, is familiar with the algorithms and data structure, minimally knows some programming language.  But the main thing is the bright head! </p><br><p>  It is necessary to study seriously - the strongest and most purposeful get to the final projects.  The most successful graduates receive invitations to work at HeadHunter or recommendations to other large IT companies. </p><br><p>  Students from such a process get actual practical knowledge not only from an online course or tutorial from a website, but directly from existing employees of an IT company, on real-world tasks, with the opportunity to ask something, clarify.  Even if the student is not invited later to HeadHunter, he has excellent chances to pass any interview for a junior or middle position in a similar technology stack. </p><br><h2 id="chemu-i-kak-uchat-v-shkole-programmistov-hhru">  What and how to teach at the School of Programmers hh.ru </h2><br><p>  <strong>How long: a</strong> course of study includes three months of theory and three months of practice in programming in Java and JavaScript, and partly in Python. </p><br><p>  <strong>Where:</strong> classes are held in the Moscow office of HeadHunter in the evenings, so it is quite possible to combine study with work.  For practicing skills students are given practical homework. </p><br><p>  <strong>Who teaches:</strong> the leading developers of HeadHunter teach at the Programming School - the very people who solve specific development tasks on hh.ru every day.  In the class we tell only what we do and use ourselves, and we know exactly how to work with it.  Who specifically included in the teaching staff, you can see on the <a href="https://school.hh.ru/">website of the School</a> . </p><br><p>  <strong>What is the trick: the</strong> main focus of classes at the Programming School is placed on the practical side of technology.  Students are engaged in real projects in production.  Educational projects Schools programmers may well go on proh on hh.ru. </p><br><p>  <strong>Atmosphere:</strong> informal.  HeadHunter is not a university, but an IT company with a democratic and friendly atmosphere.  We have to all employees from the first day turn to you. </p><br><p>  <strong>Normal school timing:</strong> </p><br><p>  <strong>September:</strong> start of recruitment (acceptance of applications). </p><br><p>  <strong>October:</strong> interviews with applicants. </p><br><p>  <strong>November-February:</strong> lectures and homework. </p><br><p>  <strong>March-May:</strong> practical work on real projects. </p><br><p>  <strong>June:</strong> project delivery and graduation. </p><br><p>  The school program includes: </p><br><ul><li>  Backend (Java Virtual Machine, Java collections + NIO, Java frameworks, search services architecture, databases and SQL, Python basics and much more); </li><li>  Frontend (CSS and layout, JavaScript, React and Redux, design and something else); </li><li>  Management and processes (engineering practices, flexible development methodologies, general knowledge of development, team building); </li><li>  The study of version control systems and different types of testing. </li></ul><br><p>  You can learn more about the program <a href="https://school.hh.ru/">on the school website</a> . </p><br><h2 id="klyuchevye-cifry-vypuska-2019">  Key figures release-2019 </h2><br><p>  In 2019 compared to <a href="https://hh.ru/article/312202">last year, the</a> number of people willing to go to school almost doubled - from 940 to 1700 people.  Of the applicants, 1,150 people started the test task, but only 87 of them successfully managed and received an invitation for an interview.  According to the results of the interview, 27 people accepted the school (in 2018 - 25), 15 people reached the final project. </p><br><p>  One of the strongest students of this year was admitted to the HeadHunter staff right during their studies, with another ten graduates the company intends to continue cooperation.  In total, the company currently employs 38 graduates of the <a href="https://school.hh.ru/">School of Programmers of</a> different years. </p><br><h2 id="chto-govoryat-vypuskniki-2019-goda">  What do graduates of 2019 say </h2><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/f5/jq/8v/f5jq8vix2iyobyfwp4uvcktqbbk.jpeg"></p><br><p>  In an ordinary school, few people liked their homework.  But at the Programmers' School, most of the students are not only happy, but sometimes even ask for "supplements": practical working out the material obtained at lectures is not boring and certainly useful. </p><br><p>  By the way, the School always collects feedback from students on each lecture - in order to constantly improve the program. </p><br><p>  For those who want to expand their knowledge in the field of coding and get new career prospects, interviews at the School of Programmers will start soon, on August 1.  <a href="https://school.hh.ru/">Waiting for you!</a> </p><br><p>  Well, and finally, the feedback of our students: </p><br><p>  <em>‚ÄúThere were no useless lectures; in general, I learned something new from each lecture.</em>  <em>Lecturers are great! ‚Äù</em> </p><br><p>  <em>"Super homely, did with pleasure!"</em> </p><br><p>  <em>‚ÄúA great introduction to Maven helped me get answers to some of my concerns.</em>  <em>Adding to this the reading of the book, I received exhaustive information on the topic. ‚Äù</em> </p><br><p>  <em>‚ÄúWith such homework it's hard not to remember!‚Äù</em> </p><br><p>  <em>‚ÄúThe task is fire‚Äù</em> </p><br><p>  <em>‚ÄúThe balance of the homework was almost perfect.</em>  <em>It was only a couple of times that there was a little more homework hanging than I could do. ‚Äù</em> </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cl/08/nu/cl08nuore2bmmgizfdal1cyuedy.jpeg"></p></div>
