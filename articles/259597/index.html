  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Announcement of new features of SharePoint Server 2016</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At the Ignite conference held in Chicago in the first decade of May, Microsoft outlined a common vision of the new functionality and SharePoint Server 2016 development plans. At several sessions, the company's official representatives officially stated that all their efforts were aimed at completing the development and starting deliveries next year. <br><br>  In accordance with the information presented at the conference, Microsoft is announcing a beta version of SharePoint Server 2016 in Q4 of this year.  The product will be fully available to customers in the second quarter in 2016. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bb2/358/bfa/bb2358bfabf444e4a79131d12a2338a1.jpg" width="600" height="300"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It is possible that the beta version will take place earlier.  Bill Beyer, senior technical product manager and Microsoft Certified Master for SharePoint, noted that the public announcement of SharePoint Server 2016 is possible by the end of the summer. <br>  Microsoft plans to focus on SharePoint functionality in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãfiles, sites, and portals.  Sett Patton, senior director of marketing for SharePoint and OneDrive, said that it is planned to make the hybrid architecture (SharePoint Server plus Office 365) available to organizations for easy migration to the clouds by the time the business is ready.  The new SharePoint will be more social, mobile, and equipped with new machine learning functionality.

      Patton noted that the capabilities of the new Office 365 will be compatible with SharePoint, Microsoft plans to include them in the expected release.  A prime example of such new products is the new generation portal in SharePoint Server 2016. It uses the Microsoft Delve content search toolkit, based on the Office Graph corporate search technology.  An upgrade is already planned for SharePoint Server 2013, which will include the Delve portal included in the SharePoint Server 2016 functionality. <br><br>  Work is also under way to expand the possibilities of using OneDrive for Business in the corporate sector, especially on the mobile front.  File sharing options will be enhanced, as well as similar SharePoint Server functionality. <br><br>  Bayer said that SharePoint Server 2016 will have a cloud service as the basis for the Foundation version, reflecting Microsoft‚Äôs current thinking about its premium products.  Creating hybrid cloud solutions means having separate data storages (in the cloud or on-premis) that are very difficult to find, but Microsoft plans to change everything in SharePoint Server 2016. The new service for cloud search will be available as a SharePoint Server 2013 update. will be included in SharePoint Server 2016. The novelty will allow organizations to unify search indexing for cloud and premium deployment options. <br><br>  SharePoint has traditionally been a variable system, the functionality of which is determined depending on the role of the user, which made it extremely inconvenient to download patches.  To solve the problem, Microsoft will add in SharePoint Server 2016 a new installation wizard with a choice of roles.  Bayer said that no one else would have to wade through 15 pages of PowerShell commands to complete the hybrid installation.  In SharePoint Server 2016, the patch problem will be resolved.  In the past, SharePoint patches could be comparable in size to themselves.  Compared to the required 37 patches for installation today and another 18 in Language Packs, in the future Microsoft plans to manage 4 and another 1 as part of Language Packs.  Updates will be less, so time costs will be dramatically reduced. <br><br>  The system requirements of SharePoint Server 2016 will include Windows Server 2012 R2 or Windows Server 10. Microsoft has decided that SharePoint Server 2013 will be the launch pad for SharePoint Server 2016. Although it will be possible to upgrade directly from SharePoint 2010. Another change in deployment conditions is lack of support for standalone installations.  In addition, deployment to a single server farm will not include SQL Server Express.  An organization will need to integrate with a database server installed on the same machine. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b02/921/770/b029217708e245d19acb47b8fef70916.jpg" width="600" height="300"><br><br>  There are other good news.  Microsoft will expand its content database size, maximum file size and other limits. <br><br>  Announced many innovations in SharePoint Server 2016: <br><br><ul><li>  Cloud-based authentication model using SAML and OAuth </li><li>  For data encryption, not only port 25, but also other, non-default ports can be used. </li><li>  Website creation will be simple and fast, and not a complicated operation, as previously </li><li>  Project Server will be integrated with SharePoint content databases </li><li>  Microsoft will create ‚Äúlong-term links‚Äù to search for files, so changing the file name or moving it will not affect the accessibility of the content. </li><li>  Microsoft will add the ability to save files in ODF format </li></ul><br><br>  The original article can be read <a href="https://redmondmag.com/articles/2015/05/07/sharepoint-2016-roadmap.aspx">here</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/259597/">https://habr.com/ru/post/259597/</a></p>
