      All tips are selected from observations.  We make a project management system and I communicate with companies about the transition to our development.  There are always difficulties in implementation and they are often associated with the use of harmful tips listed below. <br><br>  And yes, I also propose to arrange a survey on <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/4f0LbvbNhU3T1I6x1">what harmful tips are used in your company</a> .  There are 10 questions with options.  After passing the statistics on all respondents are visible. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  1. Do not build processes and do not describe them, everything will develop itself. </h4><br>  The thoughtful mechanism of the organization‚Äôs work is for wimps.  A good leader keeps everything in his head and distributes commands in time.  People in the company should be strong and understand when and what to do.  Processes either do not help or are not needed. <br><br><h4>  2. Do not take risks, do only what is 100% verified. </h4><br>  Risk is a dangerous thing and should not be dealt with at work.  You are not a sapper!  Implement only what is 100% justified before implementation.  Any changes can make it worse, because you have somehow survived to this day without it all.  Risk is not about management. <br><br><h4>  3. Offer as many new ideas as you can.  Suddenly something will drop. </h4><br>  If a project has begun, then it is worthwhile to give out as many ideas as possible and require their verification.  No one knows how to, so you need to check everything.  And then, the one who offers ideas always looks like a real specialist. <br><br><h4>  4. You do not talk about the general tasks and goals of the project, it is not interesting to anyone. </h4><br>  Everyone should know only their own piece of work.  The designer should do the design, and the programmer should write the code.  Excess information will only interfere.  You do not prepare erudites for the game PGA?  Do not tell about the overall picture of the project.  And there is no need to do processes in which this picture is always clear - it is generally very dangerous, they can go and open their own company. <br><br><h4>  5. Do not think that you are working in a team.  People work for money. </h4><br>  It‚Äôs really worth looking at your team - these are mercenaries for money, there is no team here.  Company's mission?  But who needs it!  You do not make the best sneakers in the world.  All gathered for salaries and bonuses.  Obviously, if tomorrow there is no salary, then no one will come. <br><br><h4>  6. Keep in mind that you are working mediocrity. </h4><br>  Yes, yes, have you already noticed that you can not even cope with simple tasks?  Constantly delaying the deadlines or do not do what they need.  If it were not for your team, you would have already lived in the Maldives.  Ideas you have faithful!  You are just unlucky and you are working mediocrity.  Consider this when making decisions. <br><br><h4>  7. Do not invite outside experts.  Everything is born inside. </h4><br>  A specialist from the outside is expensive and annoying.  He can tell you unpleasant things for your money.  He does not know your business as you know him and he will offer to change something.  Trainers, consultants, specialists - evil.  If you really need something, it can be done by internal forces. <br><br><h4>  8. Hold on until it breaks. </h4><br>  You have a strong position, you are the leader in the company.  You can easily live a salary officer, and a contractor under the conditions.  You are not a rag, why agree on a starting offer, even if it is reasonable.  If at the very beginning it was good, then it could only be better.  Bargaining is always appropriate and with everyone, and some generally can not pay, they also get invaluable experience. <br><br><h4>  9. Move in small steps on the spot. </h4><br>  If you really had to implement something, then try to break up the changes into small stages.  This is exactly the right approach.  Even nowadays, fashionable flexible methodologies suggest moving in stages.  Crushing tasks is smaller and starting with not the most important areas.  Try to change while keeping everything as it is. <br><br><h4>  10. Postpone if you can postpone. </h4><br>  Yes, there are system problems in the company, but they can be postponed.  There will be another time and then take a separate project manager.  In the meantime, engineers cope without any control systems.  In general, crutches in a company are normal, you are not writing code, regular refactoring is not about organization. <br><br><h4>  11. Full control, tight deadlines. </h4><br>  Deadlines are always needed everywhere.  It happens that delay the time.  But it is scary to even imagine what can happen if you do not put deadlines and remove tight controls and checks.  Deadline is the main resource management tool, you need to use it as often as possible.  No deadline - no task. <br><br><h4>  12. Divide and conquer. </h4><br>  "Department" - from the word "separate".  The processes of interaction between departments - this is unnecessary.  Sales must sell, and development must develop.  Why should they interact at all?  Why should vendors systematically learn about what has been done in development, and developers about how much and what is sold.  This is definitely reserved for the smoking room, but people will not have anything to talk about during the breaks. <br><br><h4>  13. Save on yourself.  The office is cheaper and free software. </h4><br>  If something can be free, it is worth taking it.  To pay for something is generally useless, you can always find a free equivalent.  Competitors hire a tutor in English in the office, but you can just put a free video tutorial.  And paid software is quite strange, because there really is always a free alternative. <br><br><h4>  14. Try not to change yourself. </h4><br>  You are in a good position, you already know a lot and as long as everything works for you.  Not as we would like, but it works.  When introducing something new, you personally can certainly continue the old way.  Have you implemented Agile behind the wall?  It's okay, just ask for deadlines for all tasks. <br><br><h2>  And a few more bad pointy tips </h2><br><h4>  15. Hurry up, panic </h4><br>  If again in your company <br>  All work quietly - <br>  Obviously someone is resting, <br>  And maybe all at once. <br>  Run into the office more often <br>  And from the threshold shout all: <br>  ‚ÄúWell, quickly get to work!‚Äù <br>  Better to repeat twice. <br><br>  Looking at Vasya's computer, <br>  Not realizing that there is open, <br>  Repeat loudly, clearly: <br>  "Everything is on fire, work to run!" <br>  Then of course everyone rushes, <br>  Type of work will create. <br>  You calmly walk away <br>  Smiling to myself. <br><br><h4>  16. Sit next, if Peter took up the design. </h4><br>  If important task <br>  On the designer fell, <br>  Stay close and watch - <br>  And not allow marriage. <br>  Maybe he will miss something <br>  May do wrong. <br>  But you will immediately understand everything <br>  And send it. <br><br>  He, of course, will be surprised: <br>  "Ten years was not wrong!" <br>  You need to be stricter with him <br>  But do not overdo it. <br>  Explain that today <br>  It must be done well: <br>  "The case is important, Nathan, <br>  Without me, do not complete. " <br><br><h4>  17. Do not plan regularly </h4><br>  If bored at work, <br>  All planned ahead, <br>  No movement, force majeure, <br>  You can go to Bali. <br>  That's when the project burned down <br>  Then it's time to move - <br>  Check with the team <br>  Who is right, who is wrong. <br>  Punish all the guilty <br>  Worst prizes to strip. <br>  And plan work <br>  Better immediately "yesterday." <br><br>  Plans for the company need to build <br>  Only if pripechet. <br>  And in the usual rhythm of life <br>  Everything after all will develop itself. <br>  Plans to build in advance <br>  There is a danger - you will hand over everything in time. <br>  Feint customer does not appreciate, <br>  He is not ready for this. <br><br>  Our site - <a href="https://ru.yougile.com/">YouGile.com</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/423837/">https://habr.com/ru/post/423837/</a></p>
