  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Creative mindset</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I recently stumbled upon the book ‚ÄúSerious Creative Thinking‚Äù by Edward de Bono.  A year ago, Habr√© already had a detailed <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/books/17607/">review of</a> it, but there links were given only to purchase a book.  Now everyone has the opportunity to <a href="http://bit.ly/T1VUp">download</a> it in electronic form. <br><br>  Have you often heard that we act on patterns?  So, we do not just act according to a pattern, human nature itself is created to act in this way, and it is more convenient for our mind to live.  And a breakthrough a little higher (which is available to everyone) - this is <i>creative thinking.</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I myself had thought before (and even feared) that it was possible to ‚Äúexhaust‚Äù creativity, expend all my ideas.  We also had to sit and wait for insight, postpone the case, because the task was not solved.  Now I understand that I just indulged my locked mind.  Creativity is a product of work, and if you do not stop working, then your ideas, your creativity will not disappear anywhere.  Intuition and insight, of course, visit us and so - but you can get them to serve you, and not be their servant. <br><br>  Creative thinking, which is described by Edward de Bono, is primarily needed in entrepreneurship.  By the way, entrepreneurship in its original meaning differs from business in that it is based on a new idea or concept.  Business is profit extraction on the already ‚Äúrolling‚Äù path.  Therefore, entrepreneurship in itself is the development of something original, a new look at the world we are used to ‚Äî which needs to be developed in ourselves.  And entering the market, you must constantly move forward.

      Sometimes even moving forward leaves you in relation to your competitors.  And this is also a feature of creative thinking - not just to do something, but to do it qualitatively and creatively, so that competitors just shrug their shoulders and say "we didn‚Äôt even think about that."  And certainly not sit back! <br><br>  In general, now that the book can be <a href="http://bit.ly/T1VUp">downloaded for free</a> , I propose to take a moment and work on your most valuable and integral tool ‚Äî your own brains. <br><br>  And I also want to focus the attention of those who are more interested in the practical part of applying creative thinking.  Right now, <a href="http://www.professorsclub.ru/speaker/dmolchanov">Dmitry Molchanov</a> is following a course on ‚ÄúCreative thinking in business.‚Äù  In many respects it is based on the principles laid down by Edward de Bono in this and his other books, and also contains Molchanov‚Äôs own practical work.  Courses are free and open to anyone.  They are held in the form of trainings, where you can familiarize yourself with the theory and immediately apply it in a specific situation. <br><br>  So, all the possibilities for developing creative thinking are open.  Before you there is a theory and <a href="http://www.hse-inc.ru/article/2009/09/17/_1028.htm">practice.</a>  Only one step remains - take advantage of them. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/75032/">https://habr.com/ru/post/75032/</a></p>
