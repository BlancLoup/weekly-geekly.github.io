Became a programmer.  Something like this can begin and end with a short biographical note on any developer.  At the same time, it is obvious that not everyone in childhood and even in his youth planned to link his fate with high technology.  It was curious to delve into children's diapers and learn about IT dreams for children from different countries.

At the age of nine, he also successfully passed the certification exam for a system engineer from Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer.  By the way, Marco is now 17 years old.  By this time, he managed to write a book on Windows 7 and continues to code. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/3e8/9d1/a1f/3e89d1a1f37e447ca95e693e3d5781a0.png">

    <h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Mark Zuckerberg</font> </h3><br>  Did you know that the founder of Facebook studied at the Harvard School of Psychology?  Mark Zuckerberg was born in the state of New York in the family of a dentist and psychiatrist.  In addition to his parents have three daughters.  From an early age, Mark showed an interest in programming.  At school, he distinguished himself by creating a fairly popular networked computer strategy game.  Despite the fact that already in their youth world corporations noticed a talented programmer and offered him a job, the young man chose the psychology department at Harvard University.  As a student, Mark created Facebook and in the beginning abandoned his studies.  But quite recently, Zuckerberg returned to Harvard and received an honorary doctorate from Harvard University.  By the way, there he voiced a very <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Harvard/videos/vb.105930651606/10154374909401607/%3Ftype%3D2%26theater">encouraging speech</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/2fe/6cc/4aa/2fe6cc4aaac6452d9314149baa79e39e.png"><br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Linus torvalds</font> </h3><br>  It seems that dad Linux in quiet Finland since childhood wanted to be a programmer.  Considering that the boy touched the first computer at the age of 12.  In 1981, Leo, Linus' grandfather, a mathematician, introduced his grandson to the Commodore VIC-20 computer used by him for mathematical calculations.  Linus became interested in programming and read the manuals for the machine.  Then he began to read computer magazines and write his own programs, first in BASIC and then in Assembler.  From school, Linus received scholarships for mathematics success.  The first computer they bought was Sinclair QL, which then cost almost $ 2,000. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/b4f/b6e/b62/b4fb6eb62f9d46c8b204fca141ed91b8.png"><br>  Test of attentiveness.  Find on school photos of old Linus? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/8b2/fd2/8ce/8b2fd28ce6b84942928169ed87f0c463.png"><br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Sergey Brin</font> </h3><br>  Today, few people need to explain who Sergei Mikhailovich Brin is.  One of the people changing our world and other epithets related to Google.  And forty-four years ago, the little one who appeared in the family of Soviet mathematicians was pulling at the owner of the digital world.  Meanwhile, considering that both the grandfather and the father were prominent mathematicians, it was impossible to think that the son would start growing flowers in the future. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e42/93d/49a/e4293d49afb8463ca40b62529e1b2762.png"><br><br>  At the age of six, Bryn and her parents moved from the USSR to the USA.  There he went to school.  With the school program boy coped easily.  Sergey never had any problems in studying the exact sciences, moreover, he simply fell in love with mathematics.  The parents were confident that the child would follow in their footsteps, become an engineer, a researcher or a teacher.  Sergey justified the expectations of parents.  Mathematics and computer science became his deep passion.  At school, Sergey regularly argued with teachers, putting their knowledge and competence under serious doubt.  In mathematics, young Brin was a cut above his teachers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/025/229/9d7/0252299d7c1e484981e926713c908544.png"><br><br>  My father told me about Sergey, that he grew up as an ordinary boy, but he always tried to be closer to the computer.  It all started with games and the old Commodore 64s, one of the first personal computers.  It was a birthday present for a nine year old child.  True, the grandmother was unhappy.  What grows out of this child, she grumbled, if he didn‚Äôt spend hours with the computer.  At the very beginning of the 80s, when even in the USA computers remained technical gadgets, Brin mastered programming and chose the main road of his life.  His interests focused on mathematics, in relation to the latest computer technology.  On this path and went his self-development. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/3e4/5a9/15d/3e45a915df104729b5b1e669bd81cb21.png"><br><br>  In 1993, Bryn entered Stanford University, California.  It was there that he met his current friend and ally, Larry Page.  There are legends about the birth of Google, so we will not dwell on this story for long. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Pavel Durov</font> </h3><br>  In general, the Russian Zuckerberg, if he had not created Vkontakte, could well have been a linguist and translator.  Durov studied in a class with in-depth study of four foreign languages.  After graduating from the Academic Gymnasium with honors, he entered the Faculty of Philology of St. Petersburg State University (specialty "English Philology and Translation").  By the way, Pavel graduated from the university with a red diploma, which, according to rumors, has not yet been taken from the university. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/019/831/9dc/0198319dcebc4b339919d1a7f5e1abbf.png"><br><br>  Pavel Durov is distinguished by a passion for languages: ‚ÄúLearn foreign languages.  This will unrealistically expand the depth of perception of the world and open up unprecedented perspectives for learning, development and career growth, ‚Äùhe once gave such advice to his readers on his Vkontakte page.  It also lists the languages ‚Äã‚Äãspoken by Pavel Durov: in addition to English, French, German, Spanish, and Italian, he knows Latin and Persian. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Vitalik Buterin</font> </h3><br>  Kolomna kid Vitalik Buterin is 23 years old.  Most of the life of a crypto guru lives in Canada, but has not lost contact with the Motherland.  About himself Vitalik spreads a little.  Says only that since childhood, fond of mathematics, programming and computer games.  For several years, Buterin was playing World of Warcraft.  It is possible that if he did not create Ethereum, he could well become a star cybersportsman.  By the way, many people ask why Vitaly Dmitrievich is still called Vitalik, who, in response, says that he has been treated this way since childhood.  I wonder what his nickname was at school? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/924/d4b/3da/924d4b3da5f048bca92e62d336e32182.png"><br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Nikolai Dobrovolsky</font> </h3><br>  The co-founder and vice-president of <a href="http://www.parallels.com/ru/">Parallels,</a> before he <s><b>successfully crossed the grass and</b></s> launched a <s><b>hedgehog</b></s> with a team of like-minded Windows on the Mac, successfully gnawed the granite of science in a linguistic school.  There were a lot of hobbies, but already in 10 years an inquisitive mind and tireless feet brought Nikolai to the Moscow House of Pioneers.  The local programming circle has inculcated code-building.  A couple of years was the first victory in the all-Union competition of programmers, then the prize im.Zvorykina and much more.  Next came the acquaintance with Steve Jobs and the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallels">Parallels</a> global triumph. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/3bd/487/95d/3bd48795dbab4f1c94875bd171e55d2f.png"><br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">He lived, was, became ...</font> </h3><br>  Walking through the biographies of prominent programmers and entrepreneurs in the field of IT, a reasonable question arose, did all people working in the industry really dream of exact sciences, numbers and codes from a young age?  Without hesitation, I asked the guys from the Parallels team who they wanted to be in childhood. <br><br>  <b>Dmitry Geinisman, Team Leader</b> <br>  - In childhood I wanted to be Optimus Prime.  Working today in technical support, helping our users, it can be said that partly my desire was fulfilled. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/bd0/d9b/9bd/bd0d9b9bde6f44e48b8400513a2343b5.png"><br><br>  <b>Sergey Bondar, system administrator</b> <br>  - I wanted to be a driver of a garbage truck, big, orange, with a bunch of levers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/ad1/230/e78/ad1230e78b134a629471e102adf82f38.png"><br><br>  <b>Ilya Verbin, Sr Software Developer</b> <br>  - Look at the photo, I think it will immediately become clear who I wanted to be in childhood. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/d91/038/06f/d9103806f19b49f9a4378257287edcd1.png"><br><br>  <b>Ruslan Sadovnikov, Lead Software Developer</b> <br>  - Wanted to be a DJ. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/045/9a5/083/0459a50830264896bead332693d3aa48.png"><br><br>  <b>Anton Dyaykin, Director of Educational Programs</b> <br>  - I wanted to be a herpetologist, to study snakes.  Got to the academic environment and the dream came true. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/660/c3b/047/660c3b047c094fbf8b3424cf642a2da3.png"><br><br>  <b>Ilya Kolomeitsev, Software Developer</b> <br>  - I wanted to be a musician or DJ. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/db5/54f/79a/db554f79acea457995b94dd6ee95b9c8.png"><br><br>  <b>Dima Smirkin, PR</b> <br>  - I wanted to be a broker on the stock exchange or immediately a bandit.  They had a BMW. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/425/814/c93/425814c93fed45f3828413610936dbc2.png"><br><br>  Share your childhood dreams and photos in the comments.  I wonder who wanted to be and what came out of it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/337674/">https://habr.com/ru/post/337674/</a></p>
