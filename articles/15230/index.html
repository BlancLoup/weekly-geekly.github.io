It sounds promising, but, in fact, this project is more an aggregator than a full-fledged social network of the new sample.  SocialStream allows you to link your communications from various sources in a single space.  Say, you see on your update page of your friends' photo albums from Flickr and Picasa, videos from Youtube, new messages from friends from popular blogging services. <a name="habracut"></a>  The costly screenshot of the Carnegie University website (http://www.hcii.cs.cmu.edu/M-HCI/2006/SocialstreamProject/index.php) did not show any special innovations on the Network that could reflect the new trends and fashion. for social networks.  I would point out only two specific widgets: a contact list and a calendar of events.  And the first one is actually Google Talk tracing, which has proven itself in Gmail. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/142/c9b/1d3/142c9b1d351d425ea4466ee55a3af9a8.jpg" width="400" height="323" alt="Socialstream" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  In parallel with the rumors about SocialStream, information about the Yahoo!  Mash  Recently, interest in the latter has increased due to the start of public testing.  Yesterday I unexpectedly found an invite in the mail from contact with Yahoo!  360. Curiosity took up and I quickly filled in the profile <a href="http://mash.yahoo.com/dsheiko">mash.yahoo.com/dsheiko</a> .

      We must pay tribute to the developers of Mash, they did abstract away from the flares in the development of social networking services and tried to create something new.  The essence of the service is to provide you with your personal page on the Internet, such a business card, through which virtual friends exchange with each other.  It goes without saying that there is a special mechanism for communicating with friends and monitoring their activity.  This is nothing new.  A simple projection of simple human needs in society (to present oneself, to improve social relations) on the web.  But this seemed to me a fresh decision - initially the virtual space that you get under your care is extremely ascetic.  Just a few questions and tags that characterize you as an individual, a board for self-expression and a list of friends.  Everything else, both the design and the application you are added to the page at will. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/a27/e76/19f/a27e7619f43ca900784e3953ae7a2b19.jpg" width="450" height="427" alt="Yahoo! Mash" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  As the MySpace experience shows, the passion of the masses for cluttering up their page with bad taste has no limits.  The Facebook service in turn demonstrates that there is no point for developers to write new applications for the project themselves, this task can be entrusted to users.  Yahoo!  Mash took both trends into account in the best possible way, plus he also added the ability to manipulate page blocks like in Netvibes.  However, what particularly surprised me, Mash allows (if you wish, you can turn off this option) to your friends to edit your page.  When I realized this fact, my mind for some time refused to follow this logic by inertia.  But then I introduced myself as a typical representative of a new wave of Internet users, fully owning only ICQ, asking a friend to set up a personal page for her.  As new RSS feeds, videos on the board, custom application gadgets, and glamorous backgrounds appear in her Mash profile, her eyes illuminate endless joy.  The first thing she will do next is to send a link to this page (i.e., to the Yahoo! Mash service) to all her innumerable friends.  You can say - a dream for a startup promoter.  But that is not all.  The developers have added to the initial composition of the page physiognomy of a pet.  This is something like Tamagotchi.  It can be fed, cherished, butizit and even kill.  I am sure the ‚Äúblonde on the Internet‚Äù described above will often return to your page in order to feed and groom your pet.  And when to find out that his friends can feed him too, they will all be given the appropriate order.  The potential for engaging in service is impressive. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/03a/3fa/054/03a3fa0545e67485835257c18e5da601.jpg" width="450" height="799" alt="Yahoo! Mash" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  To the minuses of the service, I would refer the questions of the ‚ÄúAbout me‚Äù section.  By itself, an attempt to give an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa person deserves respect, but the implementation, in my opinion, is a failure.  If on services like MySpace they require ‚Äúdescribe yourself‚Äù from the user (you might think that it is so easy to do, if you don‚Äôt literally describe, of course), here we see a list of questions from the category of those that they like to ask in interviews when applying for a job in western companies.  They hardly encourage the user to fill out. <br>  Let's think about why all these social networks?  It is assumed that they should help the user to find new friends.  They should help to choose among millions only those people who are really interesting to the user.  MySpace still has an army of users, for whom the only criterion when choosing a friend is profile picture.  They are not particularly looking for related interests and the like.  They use the service as a dating service.  Those who are interested in expanding the circle of contacts in the sphere of personal or professional interests want to begin to understand what a potential interlocutor represents, whether it will be interesting, whether it is worth spending time on it, before starting a conversation.  Those.  must be relevant information in the user profile.  How to get it?  I came across the implementation of the network, where 5 dozens of questions were asked, in the language of the practicing psychologist.  It is boring not only to fill, but also to read.  The user should ask for something that is easy for him to answer, where he will not have to puzzle over the form and sequence of the presentation, something closer to live communication.  Well, imagine - you are talking to a person and he to you: ‚Äúdescribe yourself‚Äù.  It would be much easier if the user profile had questions like "Tell me about any memorable case from your childhood / what happened to you lately."  Under the answer, you can leave a button for visitors to the profile "Tell me about your case."  Then it will be like a live communication thread.  As in real life, strangers (say, in a train compartment) do not dare to communicate at first, but it is worth telling someone about something, how everyone is included with their similar stories.  Communication comes to life, each participant opens, it becomes clear who is closer to you in spirit, who is not at all interesting.  Judging by the current applications, sooner or later, the ease of live communication will be recreated in social networks.  How will it be done?  Who knows, wait and see. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/15230/">https://habr.com/ru/post/15230/</a></p>
