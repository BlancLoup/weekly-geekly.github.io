  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Is there informatization of schools or all the same?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, there have been many statements in Russia about how computerization of educational institutions is developing in our country.  How schools provide computers and how support is provided.  I would like to talk about this, based on my own experience of communication and acquaintance with the alignment of forces on the ground, that is, directly in schools.  In the process of narration, it will be told about primary schools, and not about institutions of higher education. <br>  I will not dryly tell the facts and provide specific links and names.  I will express my personal mistrust and rejection of the existing state of affairs.  To begin, I will try to uncover the topic of providing computers and the participation of ICT tools in the educational process. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  But in reality, on the ground, things are far from being so rosy.  Only on Habrahabr in the comments there were many statements on this topic and they are far from the most positive.  I do not even pretend to something new in my words.  But few people openly declare this. <br>  I really faced the situation and visited in person or looked through reports on visits to several educational institutions in Moscow and the Moscow Region.  It should be clarified that these visits were not verification, but on a different topic, which I will probably tell about in separate posts.  In one of them, a secondary school, my son is studying and is in terms of IT development a little lower than the very beginning. <br>  I will immediately say a plus - the provision of schools with Internet is really carried out and is being performed relatively well.  At least from what I saw, the Internet was not only in one educational institution in the Moscow region, where in fact it was really possible to do it, even for big money and where the right moment was simply missed. <br>  This pluses ends.  The minuses begin. <br><ul><li>  The competence of people who are responsible for computer technology and its use in educational institutions often does not hold water.  The rare exceptions that are met in some separately taken schools only confirm the rule that the teacher does not have enough skills to work on a computer.  Even those who stand out from the general plan usually do not move further than the average man in the street who uses a computer in daily activities. </li><li>  far from all are provided with computing equipment, and not all of these computing facilities are used in the educational process.  And there have been cases when serious equipment is provided not centrally, but as a charitable gift (many thanks to these people, they really help children!) </li><li>  in fact, nobody except children is able to use computers in educational institutions.  Children, by virtue of their modern development, perceive the computer as a means for games. <br>  As the head of a large family, I will say that the problem of all adolescents is 10 years old.  Up to 10 years old teenager is still really interested and sent to the mainstream, where the computer is perceived as a means for creativity.  If you miss the right moment - a teenager is lost.  Considering the fact that the majority of parents place their hopes on teachers, and teachers in this regard have little to give to students, this is really an overwhelming number of the younger generation.  In my personal opinion, such a development is already gaining the scale of spontaneous action. </li><li>  in the presence of seemingly all the prerequisites for the normal development of ICT in schools, it does not exist.  I was a real witness when costly iMacs are installed in the classes, but they stand for beauty and testing.  The reason is trivial - the teacher simply does not know how to work for such a system, and most often there is no desire to study it on his own, and sometimes there is a possibility (sometimes it happens that the equipment is unofficially forbidden to touch, for it is worth checking). </li></ul><br>  And now I have questions for the community - how long?  Why on the pages of the resource talk about all sorts of newfangled things and technologies for education, but at the same time practically do not make an accessible description of the process of studying and implementation in real conditions?  Does the community participate in the life of schools and educational institutions other than those in which they study? <br>  In this regard, I am very pleased with the community of Linux User Groups, which is trying to conduct classes and expand the horizons of teachers and children.  But for some reason, this movement is very small in Moscow and the Moscow Region!  He is practically nonexistent, the majority of them participate only in beer sit-ins and the matter doesn‚Äôt go further. <br>  I am also encouraged by Microsoft‚Äôs initiatives, but I‚Äôm confused by the propriety of all the proposed solutions.  And I personally think that the company does great things, but in reality it acts as a brake.  Why spend huge amounts of money on the air every year, when they can be invested in development and education, in human brains and get much more out of them? <br>  And the last thing - to find any regulatory information on the Internet on the subject of school informatization is almost impossible.  And I am gnawed by a strong doubt that it exists at all.  Those teachers with whom I spoke are not even aware of her. <br>  _________ <br>  The text is published at the request of my friend <a href="http://softovick.habrahabr.ru/">Softovick</a> , who has a lot of questions and topics for discussion, but is not able to express them.  Therefore, if you want to put a plus or a minus - put them to the author, thank you. </div>
