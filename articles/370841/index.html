It's time to book tickets and announce the list of participants! <br><br>  So, in Bronebote 2017 is planned an international massacre.  Nine champions of the English League of fighting robots in the right corner of the ring.  Ten best Russian corners in the left corner.  And two special guests from the USA and Holland.  As before, the rules are simple: two come into the arena, one comes out. <br><br>  This time there are again many Russian newcomers on the list, some experienced Russian champions and even more Robot Wars veterans from the UK.  And the two teams this year are purely female - it looks like there will be a separate fight between them!  The winners of the BRONEBOT-2016 team, Big Brother and Weber, also participate in the competition - they have already performed at the championship in England and my interview with them on this issue will be released on Hyktimes.  In the meantime, choose who to root for!

It all started with the fact that our young people began to take an active part in the battles of robots across the country.  We looked at them for a long time.  And, once, we had the idea to compete with them.  After all, the women's team is no worse than the male.  This will be our first robot and our first competition.  The name of the robot did not appear by chance.  The captain of the girls' team is a beginner pastry chef.  That is why the robot, it was decided to call the cake.  Externally, it will be airy and light, but inside it has a harsh filling.

The new model promises to be stronger and more powerful than the previous one.  The Red Star team was founded in 2015 by young engineers from Moscow.  To date, the team consists of 9 people.  The non-replaceable leader of the team is Yevgeny Sokolov, who himself has assembled a team of people who are passionate about robotics. <br><br>  Team: Red STAR <br>  Year of creation: 2016 <br>  Weight: 100 kg <br>  Speed: 10km / h <br>  Armor: steel 2mm <br>  Power: 500 W <br>  Weapon: the robot is equipped with a horizontal action pneumatic percussion weapon <br>  Strengths: the robot is designed to defeat the mechanisms of movement of rivals (wheels, tracks).

Rake (Russia)</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/f4e/e26/e9c/f4ee26e9c733472facf0917ce46dfd1f.jpg"><br>  Historical note: With the exception of demonstration performances and friendly sparring - Rake participated for good in just one serious battle at the beginning of the 16th year.  At the same time he has a good complex combination of characteristics and we believe that with skillful, tactful management and modifications, he can potentially compete with any robot. <br><br>  Awards: <br><br>  Bronebot-16 "The robot came up with several basic ideas, born from the results of the first battles experience. This is a robot's independence from a coup - it is symmetrical in any position and equally controlled. The hull design gives sharp angles from attacks from many sides. It has original solutions combining the axes of the stroke and the instrument. We believe that the potential of the rake is not fully revealed, since it is possible to use more dangerous and sharp weapons, develop a more powerful striking force by working with motors and power, adding suspensions  E whip. It is possible to increase the protection and instrument due materials. There is the possibility to expand the arsenal of tactical by adding submunitions during rotation. <br><br>  Year of creation: 2015 <br>  Weight: 100 <br>  Speed: 21 km / h <br>  Armor: 3 mm steel <br>  Power: engine 2 stroke 800 kW <br>  Weapon: shock P-shaped rake. <br>  Strengths: power as a tractor - good grip and vitality of the frame structure.  In his combat history of knockouts, he did not get - knocked out of service due to unrelated problems with electronics - or uncharged batteries, and so on. <br>  Weaknesses: We have to limit the power of attacks.  Since there is a high risk of lagging electronics.  Dimensions lead to limited narrow maneuverability.  The weapon does not inflict enough damage with good booking from a blow from above. <br>  Team: WEBER ROBOTICS \ WEBER ROBOTICS <br><br>  <b>20.

The design moves at the expense of two motor-wheels from a hoverboard of 350 W each.  The power supply is currently responsible for a 12-volt car battery with a capacity of 60 Ah, but an upgrade is planned to a block of lithium-polymer batteries of 11.4 Volt 40 Ah.  All electronics are located in the central tube of the robot, thereby protected from external influences.  On the top of the pipe, a power toggle switch will soon be located, which can completely de-energize the robot.  But the last robot made this famous team -.
