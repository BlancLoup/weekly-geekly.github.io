I want to share my experience in creating a video surveillance system in the house.  Completely the whole process from idea to realization in reality, I will begin everything in order. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/562/bad/4e1/562bad4e18eb41a18b0a95746863f07e.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It all started 7-8 years ago.  I live in a block of flats.  We, the tenants once again cleaned, painted and whitewashed in the stairwell, but, unfortunately, in less than a week our entire work will be very educated, cultural ‚Äúpeople‚Äù will be spoiled. <br><br>  I was asked to install cameras in the stairwell on each floor.  I take the selection, installation and maintenance of equipment.  Only need to buy equipment.  The idea was supported, but, as one would expect, when the time came before the implementation and collection of funds.  Everything stalled.  As a result, he refused all of this and purchased the first camera with his personal money, putting it on his storey site.  Then he installed the camera on the street (general overview) and then added it to the porch and the porch.  So carried away by the video surveillance system.

      I want to emphasize, I do not give preference to any manufacturers.  When you need to buy something, I look only at the characteristics and what is available. <br><br>  <u>DVRs</u> <br>  If we talk about low-cost analog DVRs, then you need to pay attention to such parameters - the video recording resolution, the number of recording frames per channel (25 fps), fewer frames per second does not make sense at the present time.  I started with 6-12 frames per second, you watch the video with a delay with all that it implies.  Now common is used in DVR format - H.264.  Once I started talking about the DVR, I‚Äôll say what I have, and then we‚Äôll talk about the cameras. <br><br>  Periodically I update the equipment and at the moment in work is used: <br><br>  1. DVR REDLINE RL-D9. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d11/e2f/cfc/d11e2fcfc45344e8be2917d292a63a5c.png"><br><br>  <u>The main characteristics that I highlight for myself in this DVR:</u> <br><ul><li>  Record in 960H mode (960x576). </li><li>  For each channel, the recording speed is 25 fps.  Only 9 video inputs </li><li>  Video output to monitor, plasma: HDMI, BNC, VGA. </li><li>  Remote control via web interface. </li></ul><br>  The DVR is connected to the home LAN with the ability to connect to it via the Internet. <br><br>  <u>Cameras</u> <br>  I do not want to tire too much, give charts, comparative tables, etc.  I want to emphasize again if we are talking about the budget lines of cameras.  The most important thing in the camera is the matrix, there is a CCD and CMOS.  I do not recommend budget CMOS cameras that I personally don‚Äôt like and do not like the quality of the picture.  Cameras with a CCD matrix have a lower noise level compared to CMOS.  Therefore, I recommend cameras from the budget line with a CCD matrix. <br><br>  An important parameter in the cameras resolution.  Measured in vertical television lines (TVL).  I strongly recommend to purchase cameras with at least 600 TVL at the moment it does not make sense to take less affects the quality of the picture (my personal observations).  It is also worth paying attention to the function - day / night.  Ie during the day the picture is colored, and in the evening and at night a black and white picture.  In the evening and at night, the picture from the camera in black and white is much better, less noise compared to a color picture.  And the latest IR illumination is necessary to ensure sufficient illumination for the camera in the evening and at night, otherwise there will be a black screen and very strong noises in the picture. <br><br>  <u>Camera lens</u> <br>  In budget cameras use a lens (M12) with a fixed distance.  That is, the viewing angle in these lenses is fixed.  I picked myself up by trial and error.  The standard 3.6 mm lens did not fit me, limited the viewing angle.  Ideal at the entrance approached 2.8 mm.  A variofocal lens is also used. We can adjust the focal length and thereby set the desired viewing angle.  I use cameras with such lenses on my street, very conveniently.  You can specifically point to the object or unscrew and observe the general view. <br><br>  2. Street cameras I now have such REDLINE RL-VC720L50-2.8 ... 12B - 2 pcs. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/15e/150/161/15e1501616014f2d946cd60cc35619e0.jpg"></a> <br><br>  <u>The main characteristics that I highlight for myself in these cameras:</u> <br><ul><li>  Day / Night mode. </li><li>  IR illumination. </li><li>  Resolution: 720 TVL. </li><li>  Varifocal lens: 2.8-12 mm. </li></ul><br><br>  3. Access cameras <br>  I bought a camera and a thermocouple separately.  At the time when I first picked up the equipment, to put it mildly, not what I wanted in terms of picture quality and price.  It was profitable and easier to purchase separately and assemble yourself. <br>  - Vandal resistant thermocasing for modular cameras up to 42x42 mm in size with an integrated M12 lens. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6e9/ac6/989/6e9ac69891b54e4cb2901ebac71a6ca8.jpg"></a> <br><br>  - Modular cameras. <br><br>  Photo of the last camera purchased. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a9a/cfc/ee4/a9acfcee41804d52b67fcbc9d72d0384.png"><br><br>  <u>The main characteristics that I highlight for myself in this camera are:</u> <br><ul><li>  Lens: 2.8 mm </li><li>  Resolution: 700 TVL </li><li>  Processor: SONY CCD Effio-E DSP </li><li>  Microphone.  Checked, it works, but I do not use it. </li></ul><br><br>  4. Cable for CCTV <br>  I use combo.  It consists of a cable for video transmission (RK 75-3-32) and a power supply conductor.  Designed for outdoor use. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1e9/d16/7b9/1e9d167b9da641ceaa36dd11b1d80fcd.jpg"><br><br>  5. Power supply <br>  My cameras are powered by 12 volts.  I use a simple stabilized BP-based pulse converter, 12 volts, 5 amperes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7bf/40c/a9e/7bf40ca9ea7346dcbc02d5b75b7b314a.jpg"><br><br>  I have a few pieces.  One for reserve. <br><br>  6. RF modulator <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/31d/21f/cf7/31d21fcf79424a70976aae9a632201fe.jpeg"><br><br>  What do I need it for?  In my apartment, like many in every room on TV.  The DVR in the room is connected to the plasma via HDMI.  Next, the video recorder is connected via BNC video output to the RF modulator, and it is already connected to the TV splitter and the signal goes to the other TVs.  Only it is necessary to select a free channel on the RF modulator in order not to interfere with the existing channels in cable TV. <br><br>  Thus, video surveillance can be viewed from any room in the apartment.  To quickly turn on all TVs configured channel zero. <br><br>  The DVR, as already noted above, is also connected to the local network.  You can open a browser from any home computer and watch online, record an archive of cameras.  No need to run to the receptionist with a flash drive.  Very comfortably. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Camera photos:</b> <div class="spoiler_text"> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6e9/ac6/989/6e9ac69891b54e4cb2901ebac71a6ca8.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ab2/281/f73/ab2281f731334247a4deccaba68ab498.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eb0/ac3/c44/eb0ac3c446a8470a904000ffcaa3f024.JPG"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/14e/ab9/1d3/14eab91d3c40488e85df0fc0488dd38c.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/817/2ad/271/8172ad2714724b589efed29ec0b8f174.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/555/f8a/efc/555f8aefc08348ab81fc5035fc687384.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/15e/150/161/15e1501616014f2d946cd60cc35619e0.jpg"></a> <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">DVR web interface:</b> <div class="spoiler_text"> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1f2/71d/47a/1f271d47aa1b43f98373ca1b338d5b75.png"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/34e/357/d08/34e357d08869433e89f85c91eac842fe.png"></a> <br></div></div><br><br>  <b>Final Comments:</b> <br>  In practice, the cameras helped in determining the arson of the car, scratched, crushed the car, found out who and when.  At the entrance became much cleaner.  The child left in an unknown direction.  Find out in which direction he left.  Who us trash in the entrance.  Who climbed in the guards and brutally opened them thereby damaging.  Who and when broke inventory on the playground, etc. <br><br>  The most difficult thing of course was to stretch the cable in the cable channels through the floors of the house.  If I install new additional cameras, I‚Äôll definitely have to make my own cable channels by floors.  Available fully clogged. <br><br>  I also want to note, many will say for a long time IP-cameras in everyday life and are used everywhere.  Yes, I agree, but this system was collected for a long time, and then IP cameras only filled the market and I could not afford their cost. <br>  Now the current video surveillance system is supported, updated. <br>  In particular, the presented DVR is my second.  In particular, the old DVR could not be connected to the local network, unlike the new one.  The quality of the picture from analog cameras suits me perfectly.  The price is acceptable although due to the jump in the course it has definitely risen.  Personally, I think that it is still too early to abandon such systems in favor of IP cameras and network video recorders. <br><br>  There is who noticed or now notice.  In the title of the title I wrote - part 1. I will do a Wi-Fi radio bridge for 2 km.  Link house-cottage for video surveillance and not only.  At the cottage, just the IP camera will already be used.  I think some will be interested to read, see the process of implementation. <br><br>  I hope the article turned out for some informative and interesting. <br><br>  Thanks for attention. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/366657/">https://habr.com/ru/post/366657/</a></p>
