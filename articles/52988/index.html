      The minimum campaign budget is 100 rubles.  The minimum transfer cost is 70 kopecks ($ 0.02).  An ad is shown only in the photo section. <br><br>  PS: Maybe it‚Äôs not quite right to call this ad contextual.  Most likely this is a highly targeted ad. <br><br>  <b>Update (best comments):</b> <br>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/razb0ynik/" class="user_link">razb0ynik</a> <br><blockquote>  By the way, this afternoon I already used this service.  He advertised his photo services.  Here are the statistics: <br>  Views: 12435 <br>  Unique transitions: 144 <br>  Unique transitions left: 23 <br>  % Transition to shows: 1.15% <br>  Votes spent: 14.1 <br><br>  By the way, judging by this data, the service is still very buggy.  After all, I used exactly 10 voices, which I should have had enough for exactly 100 unique transitions.  Well, it is clear that there should be no more money spent than I had.  It was 10 and spent was written 14.1.  =) <br><br>  The audience, by the way, I was quite wide.  ‚ÄúTarget audience - 182,747 people.‚Äù <br>  And most importantly !!!  After all, everyone wants to know how many real customers.  =) And their THREE.  With two negotiations on the bill of time, and one already tomorrow at 12 in the afternoon with me.  These are all girls who want to be photographed. <br><br>  Calculations: investments 70 rubles.  The result is 3 clients per photo session for 2000 rubles each.  And yes.  And this is in 2 minutes.  =))) <br></blockquote><br>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/4eese/" class="user_link">4eese</a> <br><blockquote>  Because of the narrow targeting, you can sell: <br>  In the area on the same street opened a fitness club.  It can be advertised to the residents of this street and this area. <br>  You can advertise to local providers. <br>  You can advertise something to people with certain positions.  For example, advertising and marketing managers.  And in general, the leadership of all companies can sell something. <br>  People who are interested in parties offer parties.  :) <br>  People who live on a certain street say that there is a discount in the bar on this street. <br></blockquote><br><blockquote>  In the application there were 10 participants.  After the transition, 162 people became 72. Conversion in almost 50%. <br></blockquote><br><blockquote>  Before creating a campaign, the site insistently asked me to disable the AdBlock plugin.  Otherwise - nothing happens. <br></blockquote><br>  <b>Update 2</b> <br>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/rockbee/" class="user_link">Rockbee</a> <br><blockquote>  I bought 20 votes in the morning and tried to attract buyers for my T-shirt - do not count it for advertising, I will explain below why I bring the link :-).  I had a group done for a long time, but the information in it was outdated. <br><br>  Well, introductory: <br><br>  Audience: 213 763 people <br>  Age: from 18 to 33 <br>  Cities: St. Petersburg <br><br>  In general, I tell about the experience: <br><br>  1. Experimented with headlines - with a large audience, gradually only changing the headline reduced the number of clicks.  Purposefully - to reap only those who are interested. <br><br>  When the headline was ‚ÄúUnique T-shirt‚Äù - when updating statistics once a second, 5-9 clicks were written off.  Urgently ran everything to change. <br>  When the title became ‚ÄúT-shirt with a picture‚Äù - 3-4 clicks per second :-))).  Pancake!  Money escapes a bullet, the brain works and gives the third option (it took about 40 seconds already). <br>  Redid the headline on "Evil Rat T-shirt" and left the company.  After about 10 minutes he returned, looked at how the last passage clicked, and again went to look at the group. <br><br>  Backing off a bit from the topic: with a lower CTR, more hits.  In the case of showing a picture, this may also make sense.  Took a note. <br><br>  2. On the move, I changed the text in the group and fucked horribly - because I did not prepare in advance.  Well, clearly, I'm an idiot :-), but my hands itched a lot to see what I could do for 140 rubles.  As a result, I suspect that this is exactly what killed me - it was easy to ensure transfers on VKontakte, but if you do not prepare the site for transitions, then you can be very sorry.  In general, I knew all this, but the speed let me down.  Therefore, I cite a link to an unprepared site as an example of where people do not need to be transferred so as not to lose money. <br><br>  3. I was upset not to transfer people to the site right away.  If I could lead to the Studio site, then most likely, the impression of a T-shirt could be better than from the interface of the VKontakte group.  Well, in this case, I would have prepared more powerful. <br><br>  As a result, 1 lady wrote on the wall of the group that she was ready to buy, but only if, upon delivery of a t-shirt, it would be possible to check her quality :-)). <br><br>  Now I will try to make another group for the business center in which I work.  Let's see how the neighbors in the offices will react. <br></blockquote><br><br>  Another article on the topic: <a href="http://socvestnik.ru/2009/02/26/vkontakte-target/">Socialist</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/52988/">https://habr.com/ru/post/52988/</a></p>
