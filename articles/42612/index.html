  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Competition for startups in the field of news, the opportunity to receive funding of $ 5 million</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I was asked to tell potential participants about the competition, for which you can now submit an application (before November 1) and get a chance to win funding for your project worth $ 5 million from the <a href="http://www.knightfoundation.org/">Knight Foundation</a> .  The competition involves projects and technologies aimed at working with news and information.  The geography of the competition is not limited.  Below is a press release in Russian for all those interested.  I personally have no relation to the organizers, so it is unlikely that I will help with answers to possible questions. <br><br>  We greet you! <br>  The ‚ÄúChange the World of News‚Äù competition held by the Knight Foundation, the Knight News Challenge 2008, is an annual international competition with a prize fund of $ 5 million awarded for inventions in the field of digital information technologies that can change the exchange of news and information for the better. applications for participation until November 1. <br>  This year we are offering new support programs that should help you make your inventions even more advanced.  We also want you and your community to know about the program and be ready to apply. <br>  You invent - we finance! <br><br>  The competition is open to socially active innovators from any country in the world: from software developers to journalists, citizens and students of any age.  Do you have a great idea on how to inform residents of a specific geographic area and encourage them to share information through social networks, Web 2.0 tools or the OpenID protocol?  Or is this an idea about sharing video, photo or text information?  Do you know a way to combine game theory with work on the Internet to support communication in a particular community of people?  Dare, expand the boundaries of the possible - we are looking for one hundred percent innovation. <br>  To participate in the competition, your invention must meet four parameters: <br>  1) use digital information technology; <br>  2) be used to deliver news or information for collective use; <br>  3) in a specific geographical area; <br>  4) contain innovation. <br>  Applications must be open source and provide free access to the software and knowledge created. <br>  Innovation 2008: News Challenge Garage <br>  This year, Knight has created a new incubator - News Challenge Garage - where potential participants can learn the opinions of other participants and get advice from selection experts and winners of past competitions.  Today, more than 40 applications are in the incubator on the site Garage, created on the basis of Drupal.  At garage.newschallenge.org, you can get the support of diverse developers, online journalists, non-profit supporters, video bloggers, and social networking experts.  Everyone exhibiting their project in Garage will receive help and guidance from 30 mentors.  If you want to watch a Garage video on the Internet in different languages, go to DotSub.com and find out more.
