But this article is not about that.  I want to tell you how we tried to understand whether Clodo has an SLA or not. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first thing that catches your eye is the mention of SLA in requests for technical support: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/f04/87e/5d0/f0487e5d09d73e1ddde8ed127436ff30.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Great, so we have an SLA.  It remains only to find out the minimum guaranteed percentage of service availability.  Well, it would be nice to know about compensation, if the conditions are violated. <br><br>  Where to look for this SLA?  Obviously it can be found on the Clodo site in the contract area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe offer.  There is one here: <a href="http://www.clodo.ru/oferta.pdf">www.clodo.ru/oferta.pdf</a> Other documents are available on this page: <a href="http://www.clodo.ru/company/docs/">www.clodo.ru/company/docs</a> Specifically, the link to the SLA is here: <a href="http://www.clodo.ru/sla.pdf">www.clodo.ru/sla.pdf</a>

      Before reading this article, I recommend to familiarize yourself with the above offer contract for what they write about SLA.  In order not to deduct everything, you can immediately look at item number 8 in the offer contract. <br><br>  Yes, probably, we did not read this text very carefully.  But after the first reading, we formed the opinion that all Clodo SLA clients have 99.9% <br>  We wrote a question to tech support, about compensation for idle time, referring to the specified percentage of service availability in the document about SLA.  And the following answer was received (quote): <br><blockquote>  Good day! <br><br>  First of all, let me, on behalf of the management, apologize for the inconvenience! <br>  We have made every effort to carry out a number of preventive measures on the network equipment in order to avoid similar incidents in the future. <br>  We are ready to discuss the issue of compensation for damages in the future, if an <b>individual contract is concluded for the full administrative support of your project</b> . <br>  Thank you for your cooperation and understanding! <br>  We wish you a pleasant work! </blockquote><br>  During the subsequent correspondence, it turned out that ‚Äúan <b>individual contract for the full administrative support of your project</b> ‚Äù costs 1,800 rubles a month. <br>  Well, apparently, we somehow incorrectly read the contract of the offer and its applications.  Began to read more attentively. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/7a9/ffb/43a/7a9ffb43ad57eed2b76eb05336795a0d.png" alt="image"><br>  ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ <br>  Technical support unambiguously hints that SLA (and, moreover, compensation) appears if that same ‚Äúproject administration and maintenance‚Äù contract for 1800 per month is concluded.  And about this is written in the document. <br>  But at the same time, at the end of the document with SLA, this is written: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/74b/337/9b5/74b3379b5b89aebc7719e08b7c5c4341.png"><br>  And then we fell into a stupor.  We agreed to the terms of the offer contract when we registered the account.  In the highlighted fragment, it is unambiguously written that the ‚ÄúAgreement on the level of the service provided‚Äù is just a <b>part of the offer contract, which we have adopted</b> . <br><br>  Some may say that we find fault with the wording.  Maybe for lawyers here everything is clear and clear, and that we, the uneducated, read as we like?  The question remains open.  How would you treat written? <br><br>  Well, let's say, in Clodo, they simply messed up with the wording (or deliberately ‚Äúlight up‚Äù these 99.9% to attract new customers) or we are even ready to admit that everything is written clearly and competently and these 99.9% will be exclusively for those who entered into an additional contract for 1800 per month. <br><br>  Then I ask you to take another look at the first screenshot of requests for technical support.  It clearly states that we have ‚ÄúType SLA: Standard‚Äù.  Then we decided to find out what it is.  Here is the communication with technical support: <br><br>  <b>We:</b> <br><blockquote>  Very simple question. <br>  The ticket system says ‚ÄúType of SLA: Standard‚Äù - what is included in this SLA?  Where is the document in which conditions are indicated? <br></blockquote><br>  <b>Clodo Answer:</b> <br><blockquote>  Everything that is included in the ‚ÄúType of SLA: Standard‚Äù package is specified in the offer agreement and its annexes.  Documents are posted on our website <a href="http://www.clodo.ru/company/docs/">www.clodo.ru/company/docs</a> </blockquote><br>  <b>We:</b> <br><blockquote>  There are no such words there, alas. <br>  But the contract says <br>  eight. <br>  Applications <br>  8.1 Appendix No 1. Technical Service Standards <br>  8.2 Appendix No 2. Regulations for the use of the Operator's services <br>  8.3 Appendix No 3. Service Level Agreement <br>  Where is it, give a direct link? </blockquote><br>  <b>Clodo Answer:</b> <br><blockquote>  The agreement on the level of the service provided is discussed and signed when an individual contract is concluded for the full administration of your server, therefore this application is removed for a standard contract. </blockquote><br>  In principle, we have long understood that you can no longer think about compensation in accordance with a certain ‚Äúnon-existent‚Äù SLA.  But there was a very simple question.  A few hours during the month due to several crashes (not DDOS, namely the problems of Clodo itself) the server was unavailable.  Maybe then you can ask for a refund for the period of time before the service was provided?  To which was received the most interesting answer: <br><blockquote>  Funds deposited as prepayments cannot be recalculated or partially refunded to your account, since all allocated resources for your servers are reserved for them until the end of the prepaid period, <b>regardless of whether your resource is available on the network or not</b> . </blockquote><br>  In other words, this means that even if the virtual machine is not available the entire prepaid month (or year), the money will not be returned to you! <br>  Just in case, we clarified the following: <br><br>  <b>We:</b> <br><blockquote>  Your answers can be considered official?  Those.  on the forum to publish, immediately to the court, for example, because  The law on communication in terms of not provided services disagrees with you. <br>  - here we also sent an anecdote to defuse the situation - (deleted, so as not to clutter the article) </blockquote><br>  Clodo did not answer. <br>  <b>We:</b> <br><blockquote>  The position that you expressed in the correspondence is official? <br>  Those.  failed to agree? </blockquote><br>  <b>Clodo:</b> <br><blockquote>  Yes, the decision is final. </blockquote><br><br>  I do not want this post to look like a stream of negativity on Clodo.  It is worth noting that the virtualka in the data center Oversan-Mercury is alive and well.  There are no problems. <br><br>  It is also possible that the technical support staff gave us not quite correct answers ... <br><br>  But questions remained open to us: <br><br><ul><li>  Document about SLA consciously can be interpreted in two ways? </li><li>  What is the "Type of SLA: Standard"? </li><li>  And if we don‚Äôt have any SLA at all, then is it true that Clodo really has the right not to pay ‚Äúcompensation‚Äù for idle time in the amount of subscription fee, proportionally recalculated for the idle period? </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Applications:</b> <br>  Since  If the files referenced in the article on the Clodo website can change dramatically, I‚Äôll quote their current version here. <br>  <a href="http://files.mail.ru/67801BBE85404E54AA9A445847EB9A60">Contract offer</a> <br>  <a href="http://files.mail.ru/2DB19379366D42CEB27B18923221D430">SLA</a> <br>  At first on the Clodo site it was <a href="http://www.clodo.ru/">like this</a> : <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/50e/8ff/b06/50e8ffb063d7fe3c3203a67a7d7b5e4d.png"><br><br>  Then the text has changed: <br>  SLA 99.9% <br>  We are ready to conclude an agreement and provide the availability guarantees required for your project.  Our engineers are ready to develop a high availability solution specifically for you with the fault tolerance characteristics you specify. <br><br>  And then the banner disappeared altogether. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/192316/">https://habr.com/ru/post/192316/</a></p>
