  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Oh brave new world or continuation of the article about the relationship between the right to copy and the economic formation</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  As I wrote earlier ( <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/242777/">Pirates as pioneers - the link between the right to copy and the economic formation</a> ), in the new economic formation, the mechanisms of free copying will not destroy the economy, but, on the contrary, will form its basis.  It's time to consider how an economy can exist in the absence of a ban on copying.  Not to waste time on trifles, consider the world in which the opposite rule applies: the entire product technically possible for free copying (programs, books, films, music, etc.) can not only be copied, but without fail, by a company or an individual author. creating a product, is obliged to make it technically available for copying, not only the output product, but also all the technological files for its production: source code, 3D models, etc. With all versions of these files created during its production.  Roughly speaking, for a software company, for example, this would mean that all its repositories from all version histories, and all branches, from the very beginning of development should be open for everyone to read. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So, let's begin. <br><br>  We will begin consideration with the production process most close to the majority of visitors to this site. <br>  The first question we ask is whether it will stop software development or not.  And the answer to it is already known: we already have software development under various open licenses and although only some of them provide the code with absolutely no restrictions (for example BSD) and the other part does not have 100% freedom for any use, but imposes some restrictions (not meaningful if you do not develop closed software), nevertheless, this is all free software, payment of copies of which is not expected and nevertheless it is made.  Those.  the first question is the answer: yes, it will be produced, this is obvious, simply by the fact that this is already happening.

      What could be the economic motivation to produce software if it cannot be sold?  Is it possible to earn money on this and what will be the financial motivation for a programmer to write code and invent algorithms?  Yes, this is possible.  Companies will simply have to change the business model, take money not for copies, but for something else. <br><br>  The first thing to ask for as a paid service is the right to commit to the repository.  As I wrote above, all software companies will have to open repositories for reading, but nobody obliges them to accept your code to themselves! <br><br>  Immediately I will explain why you need to commit to another repository, and not just not getting money for it, but paying.  It would seem to have made a local copy for itself, and change it as you like.  But the development of a software product goes further and in fact you will face a choice: to stay forever with the frozen version of the product, while the competitors will use the new version with new features and fixed bugs (Oh, so it does not suit us), develop your personal version product (expensive), constantly having a local version (too much trouble + too, sooner or later they will have a commit that will not work with the local version - the changes will be too big) or simply push the company  the code that implements the desired functionality (probably the best option) and, accordingly, will pay you for those entitled to influence the development of the product, so that he has the necessary qualities to you.  From this point of view, it looks logical: GMO grass reproduces for free (unless reproduction was specifically blocked), but if you want to choose the color and the size of leaves you need, then this is no longer free.  Do you want to influence the development of the world or one of its parts - if you please invest with work or money. <br>  Well, it is clear that in addition to promoting your code in the product, you can simply hire programmers already working on the products so that they add the properties you need to the product. <br><br>  Of course, no one has canceled a number of other earnings on the software product: training, consulting, integration, etc. <br>  In any case, it turns out that money on a software product can be earned even under such harsh conditions as I indicated at the beginning of the article. <br><br>  That is, nothing terrible will happen, the software will be gradually developed and progress in its functionality.  At the same time, the environment will still be highly competitive and demanding on the quality of the product.  Even more than a competitor than with the current model: now, from the moment Akella has missed, it can take a long time to intercept a business.  An example is also MS: whatever error he makes, he will exist for several more decades just by inertia.  But if all of his software was open, then the development of their products, Windows for example, could be intercepted by a competitor at any time.  Accordingly, when using the model we are considering, the style of development of the IT field will change a little: to make sharp movements in the field of software (to introduce new languages ‚Äã‚Äãand frameworks, such as MS did by abruptly typing .NET, when everything was written in C ++ under Windows before) becomes difficult will become more conservative.  But for me this is for the best: the problem of compatibility with old solutions in today's IT development is not smooth and monotonous, but in jerks in one way or the other is very serious <br>  . <br>  As for the other mentioned types of copied data, there are also expected changes only for the better. <br><br>  Shooting a super expensive movie will not be impossible for actors to lose millions of fees, but this does not mean that filming will stop.  On the contrary, they will shoot more.  The actors will continue to play for more reasonable money (in the theater the fees are less, but the performances are going on), and the modern technical level has reached the point that a decent SLR + PC for editing will provide.  Instead of several super expensive films for teenagers, with extremely standard scenes (big money is at stake, you can‚Äôt risk with a non-standard plot!) There will be a huge amount of various movies.  Who will be the customer, if you just can not sell copies?  Well, there are a lot of options.  First is the crowdfunding and donat.  Secondly, traditional customers (who are active now) are those who need to promote their ideology into society: the state and various organizations.  And even now, if you look closely, ideology has been introduced into most films.  That is. Films will continue to shoot, there is no need to worry.  The same goes for books - most of the history of the book was a means to promote its ideology and / or popiaritsya.  As for music, even now many of my favorite musicians are not trying to make money by copying, but calmly spreading albums on the tracker themselves.  They do not live richly, they live like ordinary citizens, but who said that musicians should be millionaires?  Most of human history was completely different.  So here I am also calm that the music will be composed even in the conditions indicated at the beginning of the article. <br><br>  In conclusion, I want to remind you that what we have now resembles a situation as if we had banned cars, railways and aircraft, so as not to interfere with the horse breeder business. <br><br>  And the business as a whole will not hurt at all, the goals of the elite (successful, influential and rich people) modify the world to fit their vision, and whether they will do it in the world with allowed / forbidden copying will only affect their tactics, but not their strategy. . <br><br>  Not the technologies that provided free replication of products are wrong, and should be prohibited, but, on the contrary, the laws should be adapted to the existing technologies in order to ensure the highest quality of life for humans and humanity. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/391793/">https://habr.com/ru/post/391793/</a></p>
