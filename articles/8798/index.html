Something and I take a look at this topic from my own angle. <br><br>  The following documents are taken as a basis for reflection. <br>  <a href="http://lirik.habrahabr.ru/blog/11651.html">lirik.habrahabr.ru/blog/11651.html</a> <br>  <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2007/01/web4.html">sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2007/01/web4.html</a> <br><br>  From them (read, it's interesting) it turns out that by Godin web4 will be composed of three components of Ubiquity, Identity, Connection.  Carr just scolds web2 for amateurism and offers nothing.  So how will the new web be arranged? .. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  By and large, the success of web2 is not due to such components as UGC &amp; Ajax, but to the fact that everyone got the opportunity to express his opinion and parade everything that he does to a large number of people (even N years ago this text would not have been read by so many people) .  At the same time, naturally, the network begins (more than offline) to show up as examples of intrusiveness and impunity, as well as completely personal and analytical / working materials.  After all, hiding behind nicknames is very simple, isn't it?  :) However, now there is a more and more pronounced tendency not to hide his name.  So point one:

      <b>1. Personalization.</b> <br>  This is not exactly the personalization Seth means, which is determined by what you need and what you do.  I believe that personalization will be complete and final, in the sense that web3 will be much more personalized than it is now.  Good examples today are <a href="http://moikrug.ru/">MoiKrug</a> \ <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> , etc.  Now imagine that you are inseparable from a blog (for example, options for the same services - weight) as a person, they all know that Ivan Ivanovich Ivanov is behind him, and to be more precise, by going to an unknown service / page you can see that for the man represents him.  Fine!  This will be web3.  We must nevertheless understand that, by and large, essentially anonymous and TOS services such as LJ will in no case become extinct.  For obvious reasons :) It's just that you have a personal and personalized (!) Blog (or your column in the Times, and most likely, generally personalized services), you will perceive as a norm.  Interesting?  Go ahead :) <br><br>  <i>Comment: I singled out professional (it does not mean highly specialized) services, because there it is very important to know the person personally.</i>  <i>That is why, in my opinion, they should be ‚Äústartups‚Äù of the new web3.</i>  <i>By the way, despite being tied to personalities, at the moment their (uh ... one? At least :)) expansion occurs in strange directions (in my opinion, of course, but I have heard this point of view from other people).</i>  <i>The idea to fasten as much entertainment as possible to the personalized service, I don‚Äôt like the services that are actually anonymous in theory.</i>  <i>Including due to the lack of Usability in such heavily loaded interfaces.</i>  <i>By the way:</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>I do not think it is worth talking about interfaces in the sense of Usability, Ajax, and other buzzwords.</i>  <i>This is generally a separate topic.</i>  <i>But I think about a few other interfaces, namely "physical connections", I think it is worth it.</i>  <i>What it is?</i>  <i>So point 2</i> <br><br>  <b>2. Native (the devil knows how to translate this in this context) the entry points</b> <br>  Now everyone understands that in order to write to a blog, you need to log in to the network (many also start the browser :)), do this and that.  In fact, the weakest link here is the presence of network entry points and the convenience / speed of the ‚Äúconnection‚Äù.  This concept (entry point) is very close to what Seth is talking about (connection), but!  If you look at the Internet, then all of us (hmm ... I'm not sure about the point of view of this next generation :)) we understand that <br>  1) the entrance to the network and the actions of the software (see the text of Set, in the spirit when the refrigerator chooses food for you) must be controlled <br>  2) the entry points should not be visible and hence the next item <br>  3) there should be a lot of these points in terms of coverage and selection <br>  about the first, we‚Äôll leave the decision to the developers ‚Äôconscience :) Regarding the second and third: Seth mentions cell phones, GPS, PDA and various other hardware.  So here.  The question is not in technology, it is that the user, or rather the resident of the future network should not think about how it enters the network at all.  Those that should happen on the machine, as the choice of means for the connection, and the choice of the connection itself.  How to do it?  I think you can open this topic in the comments :) <br><br>  <i>Comment: Google has been <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/blog/google/11727.html">fighting for access channels for a</a> long time.</i>  <i>You can look at the news and read \ see how they argue it.</i>  <i>However, even in services in which access speeds are not so important (again LJ, by the way, habr is also :)) there are <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/blog/community_life/9928.html">non-technological nuances</a> .</i>  <i>their legs grow from the psychology of crowds and in general psychology.</i>  <i>So the following program point:</i> <br><br>  <b>3. Heartlessness (to be honest, I like the word spiritlessness more :)) and motivation</b> <br>  We all probably understand that a herd of lemmings will not be able to build an erplan and fly to Mars.  However, all (well, well, persuaded. Let many) believe that this can be done on the network.  The result can be seen now, and both positive (the proplan, oddly enough, built) and negative (similar to a bicycle, but flies).  The question is: how to organize people for such things as creation, criticism, verification of information, and not destruction and other negative things in a separate service?  I know the answer!  No way :) The only thing I can say is that <br>  1) Now there is a very strong trend: there are experts who are able (present on the network, interested in making evaluations and giving them) to follow the network, and among them, by the way, the percentage of those who lead personalized blogs is very high, we we know or immediately understand who is behind the blog. <br>  2) The percentage of garbage is less when the result of the activity is related to personal motivation.  I mean work in the first place and personal interests in the second.  Think about it by the way: what‚Äôs the main source of Microsoft‚Äôs revenue is not Windows, but the office ... <br><br>  <i>Comment: this is probably the most indistinctly written point, because I myself do not really understand how to explain my feelings about motivation and network garbage.</i>  <i>The main thing so far is the principle of dividing network social communities into two camps: entertainment / information and work.</i>  <i>And there is a feeling that the latter has a much better chance of becoming the technology of web3 than the first.</i>  <i>And the motivation of users in terms of generating content will be the main task of future services.</i>  <i>Those almost the first task of the service will be the orientation of users to create both with the help of technology and other tools from marketing to usability.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Yes, I do not say that the very ‚Äúcrap‚Äù is not interesting and creative (the same example with the latest <a href="http://lenta.ru/news/2007/05/17/mainbldng/">Wikipedia humor with GZ</a> ).</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>However, in the entertainment area such an approach can still (and I must say that it will) work, but in the workplace ... or used for business purposes ... I would not want to, the same wikipedia is replete with flaws.</i>  <i>And first of all, because changes in Wikipedia, as practice shows, can seriously influence people (remember, <a href="http://www.internet.ru/social/2007-01-15702">about judges</a> ?).</i>  <i>So!</i>  <i>To build a complete picture, we need one more item:</i> <br><br>  <b>4. Relation to reality</b> <br>  By and large, this item unites the previous ones, but at a qualitatively different level.  I will try to explain: <br><br>  Why do we need network social technologies at work?  The answer is very simple - it seems to me that communication is the basis of such communities.  And the farther, the more we will need to build our personal social networks, primarily in areas related to work and making money. <br><br>  Well, and what will those who work in the non-online and non-IT sphere do, for example, do tractors?  Here we come to the fact that <br>  1) it‚Äôs impossible to cover all people with social networks <br>  2) but you can try <br><br>  From this point on, you can talk about future tools and technologies.  Time will show how comfortable they are.  But their main characteristic is that the personal social network will be much stronger than it is now integrated into the working relationship.  Together with personalization, this will give a completely different level of employee mobility.  Moreover, mobility is not only in the sense of movement and travel, but also in the sense of changing jobs (this is already in a different form), as well as creating working groups around the world through social networks (very much like freelancing, but I still more complex, both legally and organizationally, working relationships). <br><br>  And a little about other areas other than working.  The next versions of entertainment services will benefit if they are even closer to real life than they are now.  That's just how close - I can only guess so far.  But more than 10 years ago (I‚Äôm from personal experience, of course, I won‚Äôt be able to say when it happened for the first time) the online communities moved to offline.  And such ‚Äúmovements‚Äù will only develop further, both technologically (technologies of ‚Äúcombining‚Äù the network and offline, the same entry points), and in other ways (starting with concerts like CurrentMusic and ending with more personal services and chips. The first thing that comes to head - automatic notification of a partner about being late for a drink or a social anonymizer in a mobile phone). <br><br>  As for today's social services, it is clear that just a photo is just one step towards building a social network, the next step is mashups as they are today (georeferencing binds content psychologically to reality psychologically, etc.).  What will happen after them?  Question :) <br><br>  My personal opinion is: after thinking about all this, I came to the conclusion that the result of all this is likely to be a really different society with different cultural and social ties.  I mean the type of connections rather than something else.  And I hope that we all will have time to get used to new opportunities :) <br><br>  <i>Comment: If you mention different technologies such as the semantic network, then I think that they will not solve all the problems.</i>  <i>Why?</i>  <i>Because the majority of those who do such things, in my opinion, do not see the people who use them for technology.</i>  <i>And this will make a huge difference in web3.</i>  <i>But, honestly, it is quite possible that something will come of this, just technology is not all that is needed for new services.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>At the moment, my opinion is about this: now everyone is feeling the trend of web2.</i>  <i>Google is <a href="http://answers.google.com/answers/">experimenting</a> , Yandex <a href="http://company.yandex.ru/blog/%3Fmsg%3D100299%26month%3D4%26year%3D2007">understands that there is something in web2.0</a> , it even tries, but does <a href="">not seem to understand what to do next</a> .</i>  <i>Nevertheless, it touched him more than that of Google.</i>  <i>Although it is possible that we still do not know much :)</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>In the meantime, with <a href="http://otvet.mail.ru/">cloning</a> and <a href="http://vkontakte.ru/">copying,</a> I personally see examples of just the banal traffic generation in the spirit of who enters the market faster, and that traffic will get faster.</i>  <i>Again, this is nothing particularly bad, just at some point, services focused mainly on traffic generation (or made to receive traffic) will receive much less profit than the rest.</i> <i><br></i> <br><br>  <b>Summarize?</b>  The next web will be linked to a person much stronger than today.  Get into the network - there will be practically no such thing, because the network will be ‚Äúat your fingertips‚Äù, and you will automatically choose the way of interaction without thinking how it will happen.  The web2 services will remain as a way to be anonymous or entertained.  Work will take place (in different areas in different ways, but) to the maximum using future services. <br><br>  I finished :) Homework, including me: make a selection of breakthrough technologies at the points indicated and invest money in them :) <br><br>  <i>Comment: Everyone has already imagined in two years a phone with a permanent broadband connection in a city completely covered by wifi which helps you to conduct business on virtually several continents?</i>  <i>:)</i> <br><br>  ps As it turned out, fantasizing in the comments is actually quite difficult, since new terms already appear quite quickly (welcome!), but what will happen next and how this ‚Äúwhat‚Äù will be called is not yet known. <br><br>  psps at a reprint do not forget to put the link: <a href="http://mikedin.livejournal.com/605966.html">mikedin.livejournal.com/605966.html</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/8798/">https://habr.com/ru/post/8798/</a></p>
