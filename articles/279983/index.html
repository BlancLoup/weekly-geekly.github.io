Accordingly, all the technologies of this company have become an asset of IBM.  Now, using the tools and capabilities of Resilient Systems, IBM is going to begin a more active work in this area.  It is worth noting that most of the team bought the company goes to work at IBM, including management.

      IBM has already introduced solutions such as <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/security/services/cybersecurity-assessment/incident-response.html">X-Force Incident Response Services</a> based on the Resilient platform.  Using this tool, company clients can plan for protection against cyber attacks, manage information security tools, respond quickly to malicious attacks, and eliminate the effects of hacking.  The integrated platform, already developed on the basis of existing solutions, includes analytics, computer technical expertise, vulnerability management and incident response technologies. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Resilient Systems tools (and now IBM) are not designed to prevent cyber threats, but to eliminate the effects of hacking as quickly as possible.  Axiom: no matter how reliable the protection is, it is possible to crack it.  Usually, companies use preventive methods of burglary and prepare for the attack itself.  But what to do if the attack has already been carried out, and thus the entire infrastructure or its separate sector has suffered?  Few companies are ready for this.  And here IBM will come to the rescue with a clear plan and technical tools to eliminate the consequences of hacking.  This includes working with insurers, disabling and "disinfecting" affected workstations, and other such actions. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.resilientsystems.com/">Resilient Systems</a> was founded in 2010.  In a relatively short time, this company managed to become one of the most well-known players in the market for solutions to respond to cyber threats.  As for IBM, the corporation in 2015-2016 decided to focus its efforts on such areas as cloud services, analytics, mobile technologies, social technologies and cyber security. <br><br>  The number of hacker attacks on corporate networks is increasing every year.  Against this background, tools that increase the reliability of their computer infrastructure are becoming increasingly popular. <br><br>  To reinforce its cyber threat toolkit, IBM has also entered into a partnership agreement with Carbon Black, the attack log company, which allows the affected organization to trace the problem from the very beginning (for example, the employee‚Äôs fake link on the phishing site) to the end.  Carbon Black technology is somewhat similar to the rewind of videotapes recording the incident - this is how the creators of the system describe how the system works. <br><br>  IBM now has technologies for tracking hacking attempts, a system to combat the attack itself and its consequences.  Plus there is an ‚Äúarchival‚Äù toolkit that allows you to find out the source of the problem that has already arisen.  And the key element is the Resilient platform, which IBM is gradually implementing throughout the entire IBM Security product portfolio. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/279983/">https://habr.com/ru/post/279983/</a></p>
