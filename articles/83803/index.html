      The office of the company is located on the metro station.  Avtozavodskaya, in the business center " <b>Omega Plaza</b> " - a glass roof, decorative cows, very beautiful in general. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/341/f9b/f0c/341f9bf0cf51ebbac8b76551f3a7798d.jpg"><br><br>  <b><a href="http://lenta.ru/">Lenta.ru</a></b> is one of the divisions of the company Rambler.  Inside a large room sits a lot of people who are sitting at the computers opposite each other and constantly scribbling and discussing something.  The team consists mainly of guys, everything is noticeably older than me) but in general the atmosphere is very friendly. <br><br>  After a brief conversation with one of the employees, I was offered to perform a test task - to find on the Internet 5 interesting news on an IT topic that would be no older than 24 hours on the original source.  After that, they had to come up with the appropriate headlines and on the final straight - write one of the posts under the format "Ribbons".  This is how everything is simple) <br><br>  At first I looked at what was already on the tape to eliminate the superfluous.  Then he ran on Habra, Crunch, Yandex, RIA-news and other ITAR-Tassam.  There were not so many really interesting things, and almost all of them were rewriting from foreign ones and retelling some reports.  But, having fiddled with half an hour, I found something - the list was of eight points.  A little later, I was asked to write a couple of paragraphs about Google Buzz.  Since the service had just started, and there was no password from my mailbox on Gmail (there would be no sense from the created mailbox), I made a post by what I‚Äôve dug in on the internet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/6c4/668/b5b/6c4668b5baab4ee409db57bdbbe57551.jpg"><br><br>  ‚Äú <i>This is where the link to user statistics is missing, I think 176 million on gmail was back in December</i> ,‚Äù ‚Äú <i>they forgot the comma here</i> ‚Äù, ‚Äúa <i>little incorrect comparison with twitter and facebook</i> ‚Äù - in general, I actually did not cope with the task, my The post was not entirely in tape format.  Well, goodbye and I went.  By the way, they said that habr is read constantly) <br><br>  Actually, what of all this I made conclusions?  The main, perhaps, for me - I realized that I could not work in such a rhythm and in such an environment.  And it‚Äôs also boring for me to rewrite other people's news (So, I think, I‚Äôll continue to do what gives me - in the rhythm that is convenient, even at home. ‚ÄúBeing aware of all the events‚Äù does not overlap my pleasure from the hobby. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/424/340/b99/424340b995e69e52ab8d770a38fd7674.jpg"><br><br>  The second - I always thought that I was reading the news) It turned out that I did not read even a thousandth of what they wrote.  In fact, working as a "vegetable" with all sorts of glands, I fly past everything that is going on around me - recognizing only the most significant and key events, and with a sufficiently large delay. <br>  Thirdly, roughly with the news, at least in the field of IT, on Russian projects, the situation is, roughly speaking, not very) Maybe I was looking badly and not there, but almost all the news was translated with a delay of a day or two - there is something to strive for. , including on Habr√©;) <br><br>  Why did I even write this LJ-shny post?  I do not know.  Most likely, I just wanted to share experiences / observations / failures.  Although, if someone tries his hand and as a result gets a good job, it will be great - this is a <a href="http://lenta.ru/vacancy/itvac/">vacancy</a> .  Work is not easy, but the conditions are more than anti-crisis) And all grown-up! <br><br>  On the way back, I jumped into player.ru and bought a mount for HD2 and charging in a car - the communicator sat in a traffic jam.  Once again, I made sure that you can‚Äôt take Chinese fixtures, but charging works for the time being. <br><br>  If someone throws interesting links, I will be grateful. <br>  <b>Successes!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/83803/">https://habr.com/ru/post/83803/</a></p>
