In fact, what is the use of <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/250872/">engines, flywheels or solenoids</a> for us if we do not know the position of the device in space?  This story is about devices that allow us not to get lost in space. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Technical progress has made orientation systems small, cheap and affordable.  Now, even a student microsatellite can boast an orientation system that space astronaut pioneers could only dream of.  Limited opportunities generated ingenious solutions. <br><br><h4>  Asymmetrical answer: no orientation </h4><br>  The first satellites and even interplanetary stations flew non-oriented.  Data transmission to Earth was conducted over the radio channel, and several antennas, so that the satellite was in communication at any position and any tumbling, weighed much less than the orientation system.  Even the first interplanetary stations flew unoriented:

Moreover, some tasks are undemanding to orientation - for example, cosmic rays can be fixed in any position of the satellite. <br><br>  Advantages: <br><ul><li>  Maximum simplicity and reliability.  Missing orientation system can not break. </li></ul><br>  Disadvantages: <br><ul><li>  It is suitable now mainly for microsatellites that solve relatively simple tasks.  "Serious" satellites without the orientation system can not do. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Solar sensor </h4><br>  By the middle of the 20th century, solar cells became a familiar and familiar thing, so it is not surprising that they went into space.  The obvious beacon for such sensors was the sun.  Its bright light hit the photosensitive element and allowed to determine the direction: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/824/d2f/ab4/824d2fab4da84d29b0a95c32efb6c8ea.jpg"><br>  <i>Various schemes of operation of modern solar sensors, below is a photosensitive matrix</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/940/672/921/9406729218bb4f129579de3ac63db569.jpg"><br>  <i>Another design option, here the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãcurved</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bf9/874/6de/bf98746deb8f4b43b439bb9430984991.jpg"><br>  <i>Modern solar sensors</i> <br><br>  Advantages: <br><ul><li>  Simplicity. </li><li>  Cheapness </li><li>  The higher the orbit, the smaller the shadow area, and the longer the sensor can work. </li><li>  Accuracy is approximately one angular minute. </li></ul><br>  Disadvantages: <br><ul><li>  Orientation on one axis only. </li><li>  Do not work in the shadow of the Earth or other celestial body. </li><li>  May be subject to interference from Earth, Moon, etc. </li></ul><br>  Only one axis on which solar sensors can stabilize the device does not interfere with their active use.  First, the solar sensor can be supplemented with other sensors.  Secondly, the solar sensor spacecraft with solar panels makes it easy to organize the spin mode on the Sun, when the device rotates aimed at it, and the solar panels operate in the most comfortable conditions. <br>  Spaceships "Vostok" wittily used the solar sensor - the axis on the Sun was used when building the orientation to decelerate the ship.  Also, solar sensors were highly demanded at interplanetary stations, because many other types of sensors cannot work outside the earth's orbit. <br>  Due to its simplicity and low cost, solar sensors are now very common in space technology. <br><br><h4>  Infrared vertical </h4><br>  Devices that fly in Earth orbit often need to determine the local vertical - the direction to the center of the Earth.  Visible photovoltaic cells are not very suitable for this - on the night side the Earth is much worse lit.  But, fortunately, in the infrared range, the warm Earth shines almost equally in the day and night hemispheres.  At low orbits, sensors determine the position of the horizon, at high orbits - scan the space in search of the warm circle of the Earth. <br>  Structurally, as a rule, infrared plotters of the vertical contain a system of mirrors or a scanning mirror: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/08d/989/b7e/08d989b7eb1c4f6e8505344112eed4a6.jpg"><br>  <i>Infrared vertical assembly with a flywheel.</i>  <i>The unit is designed for accurate orientation to Earth for geostationary satellites.</i>  <i>Clearly visible scan mirror</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/68f/248/e3a/68f248e3ae284319a74184bf3dd65b78.jpg"><br>  <i>An example of the field of view of the infrared vertical.</i>  <i>Black Circle - Earth</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6ca/f5f/bb2/6caf5fbb216541548ffdc52d6e199de3.jpg"><br>  <i>Domestic infrared verticals produced by VNIIEM OJSC</i> <br><br>  Advantages: <br><ul><li>  Able to build a local vertical on any part of the orbit. </li><li>  As a rule, high reliability. </li><li>  Good accuracy - </li></ul><br>  Disadvantages: <br><ul><li>  Orientation on one axis only. </li><li>  For low orbits, some constructions are needed, for high orbits, others. </li><li>  Relatively large size and weight. </li><li>  Only for the orbit of the earth. </li></ul><br>  The fact that orientation is based on only one axis does not prevent the widespread use of infrared verticals.  They are very useful for geostationary satellites who need to aim their antennas at Earth.  IKVs are also used in manned astronautics, for example, on modern modifications of the Soyuz spacecraft, braking orientation is made only according to its data: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/52c/ce6/589/52cce658921e44ddaf77c36ac24b5175.jpg"><br>  <i>Ship "Union".</i>  <i>Duplicate sensors IKV are shown by arrows</i> <br><br><h4>  Giroorbitant </h4><br>  In order to produce a braking impulse, it is necessary to know the direction of the orbital velocity vector.  The solar sensor will give the correct axis about once a day.  This is normal for cosmonaut flights; in the event of an emergency, a person can manually orient the ship.  But the ships "Vostok" had "twin brothers", reconnaissance satellites "Zenith", which also needed to issue a braking impulse in order to return the film taken from orbit.  The limitations of the solar sensor were unacceptable, so I had to invent something new.  This decision was giroorbitant.  When the infrared vertical works, the ship rotates because the axis to the Earth is constantly turning.  The direction of the orbital motion is known, therefore, by which direction the ship turns, you can determine its position: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/780/c60/2a2/780c602a23f948afa9274bc206f11d49.jpg"><br><br>  For example, if the ship constantly rolls to the right, then we fly right side forward.  And if the ship flies stern ahead, it will constantly raise its nose up.  With the help of a gyroscope, which seeks to maintain its position, this rotation can be determined: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b40/a65/a8d/b40a65a8d56c429097cabbd00cbc08e6.jpg"><br><br>  The stronger the arrow is deflected, the more pronounced is the rotation along this axis.  Three such frames allow measuring the rotation along three axes and turning the ship accordingly. <br>  Giroorbitants were widely used in the 60-80s, but now extinct.  Simple angular velocity sensors made it possible to efficiently measure the rotation of the apparatus, and the on-board computer would easily determine the position of the ship from this data. <br><br><h4>  Ion sensor </h4><br>  It was a beautiful idea to supplement the infrared vertical with an ion sensor.  At low Earth orbits come across molecules of the atmosphere, which can be ions - to carry an electric charge.  Putting sensors that fix the flow of ions, you can determine which side the ship is flying forward in orbit - there the flow will be maximum: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7fc/415/c66/7fc415c6609044a78e195b005057cd6d.jpg"><br>  <i>Scientific equipment for measuring the concentration of positive ions</i> <br><br>  The ion sensor worked faster ‚Äî it took almost a whole orbit to build the orientation with the gyro orbiter, and the ion sensor was able to build an orientation in ~ 10 minutes.  Unfortunately, in the region of South America is the so-called "ion pit", which makes the work of the ion sensor unstable.  According to the law of meanness, it is in the region of South America that our ships should build a braking orientation for landing in the Baikonur region.  Ion sensors stood on the first "Soyuz", but soon they were abandoned, and now they are not used anywhere. <br><br><h4>  Star sensor </h4><br>  One axis on the Sun is often not enough.  For navigation, you may need another bright object, the direction to which, together with the axis of the sun will give the desired orientation.  This object was the star Canopus - it is the second brightest in the sky and is far from the sun.  The first device that used the star for orientation was Mariner 4, which was launched to Mars in 1964.  The idea turned out to be successful, although the star sensor drank a lot of blood from the MCC - while building the orientation, it was aimed at the wrong stars, and had to ‚Äújump‚Äù around the stars for several days.  After the sensor finally aimed at Canopus, he began to lose it all the time - the rubbish flying near the probe sometimes flashed brightly and restarted the star search algorithm. <br>  The first star sensors consisted of photocells with a small field of view that could only be directed to one bright star.  Despite their limited capabilities, they were actively used at interplanetary stations.  Now technical progress, in fact, has created a new class of devices.  Modern stellar sensors use a matrix of photocells, work in tandem with a computer with a catalog of stars and determine the orientation of the vehicle according to the stars that are visible in their field of view.  Such sensors do not need preliminary construction of a rough orientation by other devices and are able to determine the position of the device, regardless of the part of the sky to which they are directed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/018/59c/a2e/01859ca2e2074314b8d8f3c02b7d1d3b.jpg"><br>  <i>Typical star sensors</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/216/a49/9fb/216a499fb81443c0adc2ce573ed4e2a4.jpg"><br>  <i>The larger the field of view, the easier it is to navigate.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f7d/f9e/c54/f7df9ec544d8461bba25069892ab3d41.jpg"><br>  <i>Illustration of the sensor operation - by the relative position of the stars, according to the catalog, the direction of sight is calculated</i> <br><br>  Advantages: <br><ul><li>  Maximum accuracy may be less than an arc second. </li><li>  Does not need other devices, can determine the exact position of their own. </li><li>  Work on any orbits. </li></ul><br>  Disadvantages: <br><ul><li>  High price. </li><li>  Do not work with the rapid rotation of the device. </li><li>  Sensitive to flare and interference. </li></ul><br>  Now stellar sensors are used where you need to know the position of the device very accurately - in telescopes and other scientific satellites. <br><br><h4>  Magnetometer </h4><br>  A relatively new direction is the construction of orientation in the Earth‚Äôs magnetic field.  Magnetometers for measuring the magnetic field were often placed at interplanetary stations, but were not used to build the orientation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eb3/785/b82/eb3785b82827454fa325983b8d532fe7.jpg"><br>  <i>Earth's magnetic field allows you to build an orientation along all three axes.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/460/138/fc5/460138fc581d4358a1bf2ebccc333c23.jpg"><br>  <i>"Scientific" magnetometer probes "Pioneer-10" and -11</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c51/3d0/791/c513d07914b348a4bdbf7b74aec94d47.jpg"><br>  <i>The first digital magnetometer.</i>  <i>This model appeared on the Mir station in 1998 and was used in the Phila boarding module of the Rosette probe.</i> <br><br>  Advantages: <br><ul><li>  Simplicity, low cost, reliability, compactness. </li><li>  Average accuracy, from angular minutes to several angular seconds. </li><li>  You can build orientation on all three axes. </li></ul><br>  Disadvantages: <br><ul><li>  Subject to interference, incl.  and from spacecraft equipment. </li><li>  Does not work above 10 000 km from the Earth. </li></ul><br>  The simplicity and low cost of magnetometers made them very popular in microsatellites. <br><br><h4>  Gyro-stabilized platform </h4><br>  Historically, spacecraft often flew unoriented or in solar spin mode.  Only in the mission target area did they include active systems, build orientation along three axes, and perform their task.  But what if we need to maintain an arbitrary orientation for a long time?  In this case, we need to "remember" the current position and fix our turns and maneuvers.  And for this, humanity did not invent anything better than gyroscopes (measure angles of rotation) and accelerometers (measure linear accelerations). <br>  <b>Gyroscopes</b> <br>  The property of a gyroscope is widely known to strive to maintain its position in space: <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/cquvA_IpEsA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhh_2mnpK9Mqfl9BKu_3QsJBYiweLg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Initially, the gyroscopes were only mechanical.  But technological progress has led to the emergence of many other types. <br>  <b>Optical gyros</b> .  Very high accuracy and the absence of moving parts are different optical gyroscopes - laser and fiber optic.  In this case, the Sagnac effect is used - the phase shift of waves in a rotating ring interferometer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3dd/459/b33/3dd459b335354ffba2fe4082dc879934.jpg"><br>  <i>Laser gyro</i> <br><br>  <b>Solid-state wave gyroscopes</b> .  In this case, the precession of the standing wave of a resonating solid is measured.  They contain no moving parts and are characterized by very high accuracy. <br><br>  <b>Vibration gyros</b> .  The Coriolis effect is used for work - oscillations of one part of the gyroscope reject the sensitive part when turning: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aae/abc/029/aaeabc029fe0416e8f72b09d9dde4df1.jpg"><br><br>  Vibration gyroscopes are produced in MEMS-performance, they are distinguished by low cost and very small size with relatively good accuracy.  It is these gyroscopes that stand in telephones, quadcopters, and the like.  MEMS-gyroscope can work in space, and they are put on microsatellites. <br><br>  The size and accuracy of gyros clearly: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/045/525/1ad/0455251ad8bf485aa534e266653735df.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Accelerometers</b> <br>  Structurally, accelerometers are scales - a fixed load changes its weight under the influence of accelerations, and the sensor converts this weight into an acceleration value.  Now accelerometers, in addition to large and expensive versions, have got MEMS-analogs: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a03/bda/65d/a03bda65d25b4cc58bf4964cbd4c5c2a.jpg"><br>  <i>An example of a ‚Äúlarge‚Äù accelerometer</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0a7/f09/65b/0a7f0965bc2e47398fe820324a8a846a.jpg"><br>  <i>Micrograph of MEMS accelerometer</i> <br><br>  The combination of three accelerometers and three gyroscopes allows you to fix the rotation and acceleration on all three axes.  Such a device is called a gyrostabilized platform.  At the dawn of cosmonautics, they were possible only on a gimbal, were very complex and expensive. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/756/051/72d/75605172da434ef3ad3ea7d3347c5288.jpg"><br>  <i>Gyro-stabilized platform ships Apollo.</i>  <i>The blue cylinder in the foreground is a gyroscope.</i>  <i><a href="https://youtu.be/9YA7X5we8ng%3Ft%3D8m14s">Video Test Platform</a></i> <br><br>  The pinnacle of the mechanical systems were the beskardannye systems when the platform hung motionless in gas flows.  It was a high-tech, the result of the work of large teams, very expensive and secret devices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/03e/5b1/07e/03e5b107e18c458f87b23299700f3d32.jpg"><br>  <i>The sphere in the center is a gyrostabilized platform.</i>  <i>Peacekeeper ICBM guidance system</i> <br><br>  But now the development of electronics has led to the fact that the platform with suitable for simple satellites accuracy fits in the palm of your hand, it is developed by students, and even publish the source code. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Egl75nv9E7s%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhg1BUArBxKyGn3vCOT2RIJaEAfBAQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  MARG-platforms have become an interesting innovation.  In them, data from gyroscopes and accelerometers are complemented by magnetic sensors, which allows to correct the accumulated error of gyroscopes.  A MARG sensor is probably the most suitable option for microsatellites - it is small, simple, cheap, has no moving parts, consumes little energy, provides orientation along three axes with error correction. <br>  In "serious" systems, stellar sensors are commonly used to correct errors in the orientation of a gyro-stabilized platform. <br>  The trajectory error, as a rule, is corrected by the systems of radio monitoring of the orbit - antennas on the Earth can determine its position and speed very accurately from signals from the apparatus.  In low orbits for this, a cheap analogue has recently appeared - GPS / GLONASS. <br><br><h4>  Additional sources of information </h4><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D5ccWeEFglO8">Lecture ‚ÄúDesigning an Orientation and Stabilization System‚Äù.</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~stengel/MAE342Lecture13.pdf">Abstract "orientation sensors and actuators".</a> <br><br>  By the tag <a href="http://geektimes.ru/search/%3Fq%3D%5B%25D0%259D%25D0%25A1%25D0%25A0%25D0%25A2%5D%26target_type%3Dposts">"inconspicuous difficulties"</a> - publications about launch vehicles, launch facilities, orientation systems. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365759/">https://habr.com/ru/post/365759/</a></p>
