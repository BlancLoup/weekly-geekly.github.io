The absolute majority of ‚Äúdrummers‚Äù were sure that it was easy to recognize the song, but the results were amazing: only 2.5% of the listeners guessed the melody. <br><br>  The essence of the "curse" is that the "drummers" know exactly the melody that they tap, and are confident that others just MUST guess it.  But others hear only arrhythmic sounds.  This also applies to 70% of articles on Habr√©, which 2% of the pros are minus for the coarse, and in general any things that we take to be "taken for granted." <br><br>  And if forum misunderstanding affects only CSW, then users' misunderstanding will easily bury your application.  This article is a collection of life hacking in the wake of personal experience in dealing with informational imbalances and working through the weak points of UX. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h2>  From complex to simple </h2><br>  Long instructions (onboarding) do not enlighten, but anger users.  We rarely read instructions in real life, and extensive instructions in the application cause it to be deleted.  The first impression of use is not smoothed by any features. <br><br>  Effective onboarding can increase LTV up to 500%, so here are a few things to keep in mind when developing instructions: <br><br><ul><li>  Make login and account creation as simple as possible, do not overload it with additional fields and do not require passwords of more than 8 characters, with capital letters and symbols: </li></ul><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pa/nj/-d/panj-d-rlifirviubpwmmlxmibk.png" alt="image"></div><br><ul><li>  Do not overload the application with long instructions before using - wait until the user gets to them and use the tooltips. </li><li>  Ask your friends 5-7 to test the registration process and watch their actions carefully. </li></ul><br><h2>  Consistency and Design Sequence </h2><br>  Often, application developers work with several designers to outsource at different stages.  Therefore, the final application looks like Frankenstein, which does not add trust.  To maintain engagement, users need consistency: navigation, application colors, fonts, and the overall style should not change. <br><br>  There are three main things that the user ALWAYS pays attention to: <br><br><ul><li>  High-quality graphics </li><li>  Concise and clear content </li><li>  The minimum size of clickable UI elements (do not use a size smaller than 44 √ó 44px) </li></ul><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/l2/ta/su/l2tasum2anhm_4pxwc6gg-94im4.png" alt="image"></div><br>  Ask yourself - can users foresee the next step?  Do they splash blood from their eyes at the sight of your cute color combination? <br><br>  Rule one screen - one action, too, has not been canceled. <br><br><h2>  Push notifications to the topic </h2><br>  Push notifications are an effective interaction tool that requires a thoughtful approach. <br><br>  It is bad when notifications are configured for all users, without reference to the region: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rq/dz/0_/rqdz0_des4cptrdq2fccw8akvvc.png" alt="image"></div><br>  But even worse - when the text and the message of the notification sound aggressive and do not correspond to the age of the user.  Here is a bad example of push notifications that came to a MyPet game user, a 9-year-old girl on the phone: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tn/u7/l9/tnu7l9vyyc_vyspdmpdvhipo74w.png" alt="image"></div><br>  There are a few simple tonal rules for push notifications: <br><br><ol><li>  The right time - based on the behavior or location of the user.  Notification of a comment or activity must arrive BEFORE the user responds to the comment or is active in the application. </li><li>  Important personalized message - push-notification is significant for a specific user. </li><li>  Motivation for action: the user understands what action to take. </li></ol><br>  Rich push notifications work very well, where you can add audio, gif or video to the message: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lk/zm/5g/lkzm5gcezbxl46buaqeg3ugi4v0.png" alt="image"></div><br><h2>  Request a minimum of access </h2><br>  In the <a href="https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/core-app-quality%3Fhl%3Dru">official guide for android developers</a> write: the application must request the absolute minimum of access rights that are necessary for it to maintain the basic functionality. <br><br>  If you need more data, explain why the application has access to additional user data: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sa/sa/9y/sasa9yiyujfbipoecyk4fiefe2w.png" alt="image"></div><br><h2>  Monetize correctly </h2><br>  Even the most successful application can be spoiled by inappropriate advertising.  This is what happens when the monetization strategy is urgently customized to the existing UX, ignoring the user flow. <br>  If the application is already finished, and I urgently want to monetize it right now, take a little time to integrate <a href="https://apps.epom.com/formats">user-friendly formats</a> and search for native placements in order not to distract the user's attention from the application. <br><br>  Among the popular advertising formats, pay attention to the smart banner that adapts to the screen size - it is more efficient than the standard banner and looks much better: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/p1/uh/yq/p1uhyqfitoxov0tqkj7tt-tnpwy.gif" alt="image"></div><br><h2>  Pump the "stickiness" of the application </h2><br>  Given how important the stickiness of the application is, it is surprising how little attention developers pay to it.  The outflow of users of the application is constantly growing - <a href="http://info.localytics.com/blog/23-of-users-abandon-an-app-after-one-use">25% of users do not return</a> to the application after installation.  And if the application is opened only once a week, there is a <a href="https://www.localytics.com/wp-content/themes/localytics/pdf/is-your-app-sticky-enough.pdf">60% chance that it will be abandoned</a> - too much competition for the user's attention. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/i5/91/51/i59151kjzuscsgzbge-pslownpm.png" alt="image"></div><br>  No application in my memory was made IMMEDIATELY 100% user friendly and understandable.  If you know that some aspects of the application can be improved - most likely it is.  And even when everything works like a clock, it will not hurt to once again critically evaluate the UX of your application. <br><br>  I'm sure each of you had your own UX-rake, share them in the comments :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/422477/">https://habr.com/ru/post/422477/</a></p>
