Wimax is coming <br><img src="http://media.macrumorslive.com/p/1168367521-thumb.jpg"><br>  Thanks for the fact that Apple makes reality. <br>  21:45 Another company that is heading for an alliance with Apple - Yahoo.  One of the company's founders, Jerry Yang, appeared on the scene, giving a whole stream of compliments to the iPhone: ‚ÄúWe want to adopt what Apple is reinventing now - a great form factor, user-friendly interface - and turn it into a perfect Internet solution .  Our goal is to introduce consumer electronics to the world of Web 2.0.  In general, Steve, you know my address, be sure to contact me. ‚Äù <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/99f/be7/2b5/99fbe72b5ba130e7d7a5a00655539019.jpg"><br>  Built-in search from yahoo and mail, as already mentioned.  Account for each. <br>  Yahu reinvents mail, spam and how to get rid of it)))) It's funny he said) Or me) <br>  21:47 The head of Yahoo leaves the scene, and Steve Jobs continues the show - ‚ÄúSo, the communicator, iPod and phone.  Let's try this "all in one" in real life ... " <br><br>  Simple, but such nice tricks with photos - at the slightest whim of Schiller, they turn into wallpaper for the screen, then into a screensaver.  Incoming call - and the music is automatically muffled, the call is completed - the music again come to the fore.  At the same time - no delays and pauses.  A storm of applause. <br>  21:50 There is a turn of accessories: stereo headphones with a microphone and a switch, a miniature Bluetooth headset.  Batteries - five hours of talk time, watching videos or connecting to Internet, sixteen hours of work in the music player mode.
