      The project provides for a significant expansion of the powers of Roskomnadzor, which is entitled to manage the routers of Russian Internet providers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The draft law provides for the following provisions: <br><br><ol><li>  The necessary rules for traffic routing are determined, control over their compliance is organized.  It creates an opportunity to minimize the transfer abroad of data exchanged between Russian users. </li><li>  Cross-border communication lines and traffic exchange points are defined.  Their owners, telecom operators are obliged to ensure the possibility of centralized traffic control. </li><li>  It is possible to install technical equipment on communication networks that determine the source of the transmitted traffic.  Technical means will have to have the ability to limit access to resources with prohibited information not only by network addresses, but also by prohibiting the passage of passing traffic. </li><li>  An infrastructure is being created that makes it possible to ensure the operability of Russian Internet resources in the event of the impossibility of connecting Russian telecom operators to foreign root Internet servers. </li><li>  It introduces the need for regular exercises of government authorities, telecom operators and owners of technological networks to identify threats and develop measures to restore the efficiency of the Russian segment of the Internet. </li></ol><br>  The authors of the draft law are Andrei Klishas, ‚Äã‚Äãhead of the committee of the Federation Council on state construction, his first deputy Lyudmila Bokova and deputy Andrei Lugovoi. <br><br>  The Ministry of Communications and Mass Media supported the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe draft law as a whole: ‚ÄúThe Internet has become too much for the state to allow itself not to pay attention to it.  Now a lot depends on the Internet economically, socially and politically, and it is impossible to let its development go by itself.  Otherwise, we may lose our sovereignty, ‚Äù <a href="https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/3842329">commented the</a> deputy head of the ministry, Oleg Ivanov. <br><br>  In a recent <a href="https://habr.com/post/434152/">interview, the</a> head of Roskomnadzor, Alexander Zharov, said that ‚Äúany country, including the Russian Federation, must be fundamentally prepared for different scenarios,‚Äù including the isolated work of the local segment. <br><br>  However, such a ‚Äúbasic readiness‚Äù can be costly for the Russian budget.  The package of documents for the draft law includes a financial and economic rationale from one phrase: ‚ÄúAdoption and implementation of a federal law will not require expenses from the federal budget.‚Äù  However, not everyone agrees with this. <br><br>  The Working Group ‚ÄúSvyaz and IT‚Äù of the Expert Council under the Government of the Russian Federation <a href="https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/3842329">prepared a review of</a> the text of the draft law.  According to experts, only one-time costs can reach <b>25 billion rubles.</b>  for research and development work, the creation and maintenance of a registry of traffic exchange points, the expansion of staff under Roscomnadzor‚Äôs structures and the conduct of exercises.  In addition, compensation will be required for telecom operators in the event of a network disruption, the risk of which is assessed by industry participants as high, experts say.  They should be provided in the federal budget at the level of up to 10% of the market volume, that is <b>134 billion rubles.</b>  per year, it says in the recall. <br><br>  Experts also note that the text of the draft law does not define what the threats are for the Russian segment of the Network: ‚ÄúIt is not clear what exactly the threats are.  Neither the bill nor the explanatory note describe neither the threats themselves, nor the shortcomings of the current legislation, ‚Äùsaid the working group in its response. <br><br>  Experts note that the project significantly expands the powers of Roskomnadzor, and this ‚Äúpartially contradicts the current legislation‚Äù.  Specifically, the ‚Äúauthority to eliminate threats to the integrity, stability and security of functioning‚Äù of the Internet is already assigned to the FSB.  Roskomnadzor also does not now have the right to issue acts containing requirements for communication networks. <br><br>  The members of the Expert Council‚Äôs working group generally consider the requirements of the draft law to be technically impracticable: the document ‚Äúessentially invites telecom operators and other persons to submit to Roskomnadzor a complete scheme of their network and traffic routing in it, which is technically impossible, since the network is a living multi-level system, constantly expanding and updated. <br><br>  In some cases, the project provides for the <b>transfer of control of routers from telecom operators to Roskomnadzor</b> , although the professional competence of Roskomnadzor employees <a href="https://www.the-village.ru/village/people/howtobe/316129-zapreschalschik">is in serious doubt</a> . <br><br>  Some experts <a href="https://roskomsvoboda.org/43778/">believe</a> that the need for isolation and effective filtering of the Runet is not required by the authorities in order to protect the Network from external aggression, but for a completely opposite purpose: to be able to turn off the Network‚Äôs access to citizens or effectively block access to unwanted resources.  For example, this may be necessary in the case of civil unrest. <br><br><blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jy/sd/rr/jysdrr7tqgfjt50wtcshw89ctho.png" align="left"><h3>  Minute of care from UFO </h3><br>  This material could cause contradictory feelings, so before writing a comment, refresh something important in your memory: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">How to write a comment and survive</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  Do not write abusive comments, do not go to the person. </li><li>  Refrain from using obscene language and toxic behavior (even in a veiled form). </li><li>  To report comments that violate the rules of the site, use the "Report" button (if available) or <a href="https://habr.com/feedback/%3Ftype%3D4">a feedback form</a> . </li></ul><br>  What to do if: <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/karma/">minus karma</a> |  <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/sandbox/">blocked account</a> <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/other/">Code of authors Habra</a> and <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/other/">habraetiket</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/rules/">Full site rules</a> </div></div></blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/434292/">https://habr.com/ru/post/434292/</a></p>
