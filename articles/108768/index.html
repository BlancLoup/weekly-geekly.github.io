      Two more projects are being developed for their money from the 1st Harvest.  This service is a print on demand Prondo.ru and service group discounts CityRadar.  They started this summer. <br><br>  <a href="http://prondo.ru/">For</a> several months, <a href="http://prondo.ru/">Prondo</a> worked hard on his project since the author of the idea found a programmer on Harvest, and they made the first sketches.  Slowly overgrown team, connections.  The project with its idea got to the very point, now such services are relevant.  So far they have reached an operating profit and continue to grow. <br><br>  With <a href="http://cityradar.ru/">CityRadar</a> everything was more complicated.  This is a case where a long harnessed, but quickly drove off.  When in the spring the services of collective discounts began to grow by leaps and bounds, Zhenya with his project could not get off the ground - there was no money and no programmers.  In April, through the Harvest website, it was found by people who rallied into a team, invested their money, found developers.  What did they hope for, starting with their project closer to August? <br><br>  Apparently, a thoroughly worked out concept: a lot of good discounts and content for them, the ability to renew promotions, hold corporate banquets with discounts and something else - you can learn everything in detail on their website.  While CityRadar is actively developing, delighting with new quality offers and the fact that they quickly moved to other cities. <br><br>  The April Harvest in MFPA turned out to be more intimate.  But he ‚Äúgave to the world‚Äù <a href="http://wannafuck.ru/">Wannafuck</a> , the express dating service launched in early 2011.  His ideologue Rustem Bogdanov came to us with a lot of groundwork (before this service lived in his head for two years) and with a clear goal - to get expert advice.  Rustem got what he wanted - he thought through the design of the interfaces, polished the concept and checked the marketing plans. <br><br>  And then he began work on a project that lasted the entire hot summer of 2010.  One of the founders of Harvest, Renat Garipov, advised the creation of a financial and economic model.  And in the fall, Wannafuck attracted investors, raised a seed-round ($ 150,000) and received a commitment of $ 2.2 million in further investments.  Now the service is being actively developed and <a href="http://wannafuck.ru/">pre-registration is</a> open for those who want to test it earlier than others. <br><br>  The October Harvest, which was first held on the basis of the Academy of National Economy, became a real sensation - about 300 guests and participants, over 60 ideas and projects presented.  About twenty projects worked, argued, changed business models.  Two days with the support of experts, they actively implemented these ideas. <br><br>  To sum it up is still early.  But, nevertheless ... Immediately after the tournament <a href="http://darru.ru/">Darru.ru</a> and <a href="http://sportfort.ru/">SportFort.ru were launched</a> , but we can expect a good start from many more projects: SmartInsurance, 4JO.IN, Potok-FM and others. <br><br>  So, it's time for the fourth in a row Harvest.  The atmosphere of ‚Äúworking weekends‚Äù, valuable contacts, the ability to spend hours working on a startup together with diversified experts - all this can be applied to your idea or project. <br><br>  <a href="http://greenfield.timepad.ru/event/3908">Registration is</a> open until Friday evening.  We are waiting for people who are interested in working in a startup - the authors of ideas, developers, marketers, pr-schikov, financiers and many others.  Come, make successful projects! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/108768/">https://habr.com/ru/post/108768/</a></p>
