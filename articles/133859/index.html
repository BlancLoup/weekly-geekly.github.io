      ‚ÄúThe target audience for this particular campaign are those that cannot be attracted by traditional advertising methods and may not know that GCHQ is recruiting employees for this job,‚Äù the agency‚Äôs source said. <br><br>  ‚ÄúTheir skills may be ideal for our work, and yet they cannot understand how they could apply them to the working environment, especially where they have the opportunity to make their invaluable contribution.‚Äù <br><br>  The competition began in secret on November 3 and will run until December 12. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  GCHQ said that as soon as the code is cracked, a person will be presented with a keyword to enter into the form field.  Then they will be redirected to the recruitment page of the agency website. <br><br>  The organization said it did not worry that the answer to the task could be distributed throughout the Internet. <br><br>  They said that they would still benefit, because as a result of the discussion they would ‚Äúgenerate new recruitment questions.‚Äù <br><br>  However, GCHQ added that anyone who had previously illegally engaged in hacking may not be suitable.  The agency‚Äôs website also states that members must be British citizens. <br><br>  Problems <br>  This step was taken two months ago when Prime Minister David Cameron presented his government response at an intelligence meeting and the Committee‚Äôs annual security report. <br><br>  The committee‚Äôs document noted concerns about the ‚Äúinability to maintain appropriate staff of Internet specialists‚Äù of GCHQ and response to cyber threats. <br><br>  He said that the cabinet supported initiatives such as the threat to computer security, which contributes to growth in cyber security through annual competitions and events. <br><br>  Anyone who decrypts the code will be asked to apply for a job. <br>  Following this, the government announced last week that it will be created by department specialists at GCHQ. <br><br>  The combined Cyber ‚Äã‚Äãgroup will focus on addressing the growing threat of cyber attacks from organized criminals, terrorists and hostile hacktivist states. <br><br>  GCHQ claimed that it was the first case of this kind of task ever performed by an organization whose goal is to identify similar skills. <br><br>  However, the agency has already used unusual recruitment methods in the past. <br><br>  In 2009, they posted video content, themes and downloadable photos on the Xbox Live network, which appeared during the game Call of Duty, Assassin's Creed and other video games. <br><br>  Two years earlier, she chose gamers to target digital posters on the Internet including Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Vegas and Splinter Cell Double Agent. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.canyoucrackit.co.uk/">Try to decrypt the code</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/">A source</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/133859/">https://habr.com/ru/post/133859/</a></p>
