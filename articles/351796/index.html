  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Conference DEFCON 19. "The Art of trolling." Matt "OpenFly" Joyce</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> As I said in my biography, this speech is dedicated to two great people whom we recently lost - Randy Savage Macho Man and Ronald Reagan.  And more recently, the deceased guy named Buba, who played in the "Police Academy".  So welcome to the art of trolling! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/p8/y5/vi/p8y5viu_y42keztelpojvj-mcdo.jpeg"><br><br>  I thought that you would take the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa trolling report as a joke, but you met this statement with enthusiasm, so I will tell you everything I know about this.  I am Matt Joyce, known by the nickname "openfly", the one who can troll people, bringing them to the extreme degree of irritation.  I am known in many circles as a professional troll, banned in the IRC and Fark chat system, and in the Unreal 2004 video conference I was introduced as a person ‚Äúwho is banned on virtually every server and forum known on the Internet.‚Äù  In addition, I am working on an open source federal cloud program and am participating in the creation of Fonera 2.0n images for the ChaosVPN project. <a name="habracut"></a>

      So, a troll can use any discussion topic to ‚Äúsadden‚Äù a person or make him a laughing stock.  Therefore, no one wants to be the object of attacks troll.  However, for a long time there is a connection between trolling and burglary, troll and hacker, whether in the field of information security or simply in the development of technology.  I will explain to you the definition of a troll, tell the story of trolling in human culture (as well as its contribution to this culture) and the methods that trolls usually use to realize their intended goals. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/m7/0r/qx/m70rqxb6hgdilb_wik6r1p4pmvm.jpeg"><br><br>  I will talk about several past projects, which I rate as successful trolling.  I intend to use these projects as substantive lessons for the practical application of the discussed methods.  Trolling is intermediate between hardware and software projects and can sometimes carry a variety of ‚Äúpayloads‚Äù. <br><br>  I will try to define what a troll is.  And you, of course, agree with my definition.  And if you do not agree, you can post comments on my blog on this topic. <br>  So, if a person writes: ‚ÄúI am ready to protest against people who kill whales,‚Äù this is not a Troll.  In the Internet publications, printed journals, even in the Oxford dictionary one can find many definitions of this term, but I agree with this: ‚Äúdeliberately insincerely places information that forces benevolent, sincere people to react emotionally to it.  Often provokes an exacerbation of the situation during discussions. ‚Äù <br><br>  I will quote Gandhi: ‚ÄúI forbid modernist artists, representatives of degenerative art, to show their creations to the public.  If they see the fields in blue, they are insane, and they have a place in the hospital.  If they just pretend to see the fields in blue, they are criminals and should be in prison.  I will protect my people from them! ‚Äù <br><br>  My definition goes like this: ‚ÄúTrolling is the ability to make anyone laugh so much that he throws through his nose a portion of a freshly drunk 30 year old selected Scotch whiskey.‚Äù  Is this art?  Well, it‚Äôs like putting a quote from Sun Tzu to the attrition.org computer security conference, posing as a rabid squirrel. <br><br>  God was not a troll!  But he had a son, Jesus Christ.  So Jesus is a troll.  He trolled his prophets and conciliators on and without cause.  In the same row is Loki, the Norse god of deception, and Prometheus, who deceived Zeus.  Everyone knows that Prometheus stole the fire, but they do not know why he did it.  He did not need fire to give it to people, but to fry a piece of pork for himself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zi/2v/7q/zi2v7qioei1h8qdmphwxqcbyvso.jpeg"><br><br>  The next troll was Coyote, the most cunning character of Native American fairy tales, who troll Native Americans until the pale faces set off across the ocean in search of India. <br><br>  This is followed by the Anansi spider, god of 419 scammers.  This petty dirty dog ‚Äã‚Äãbecame famous for mocking unsuspecting animals. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oj/ro/rs/ojrorskcbigd-hxpe7phbsi-siw.jpeg"><br><br>  The trolling pattern is Mr. Stubby.  This device, lying on the dump, was found by hackers from the NYS Resistor group, and turned this ‚Äúincomprehensible‚Äù into a robot.  He knows how to cut, plane and, of course, prick with his knife, and is controlled by a mobile phone and voice commands. <br><br>  Mr.  Stabby is a sample of trolling, because people turn it on with their smartphone, they say something to it, they drag it, and bang - Stubby hits you with his knife!  That's what trolling can do!  In general, these guys are great - they presented a real business model and showed how it should look.  They decided to troll the theme of a robotic arm that gained such popularity.  NYS Resistor took 3rd place among 14 models presented at TechCranch, but when the jury got to know these guys better, they awarded them 2nd place.  They especially liked the fact that a person could call and tell the robot what to do.  This was Mr. Stubby‚Äôs unique function. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/te/be/m3/tebem3ww0v8ehrtfiutvn8qaudu.jpeg"><br><br>  This is what classic trolling looks like. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oq/v0/-t/oqv0-tfvyjymtaghpccz7uusbqy.jpeg"><br><br>  So, in the field of trolling there are certain logical fallacies.  This happens during a conversation with a man who suddenly became distracted and released an important part of the conversation, and then again continued the conversation.  The American educational system is based on the principle that our brain initially has some kind of functional deficiencies, so it‚Äôs not difficult to make anyone say something stupid or make a person believe some nonsense.  A striking example of such an attitude is the comics, one of which, ‚ÄúConner and Mark,‚Äù I will cite as an example and call the first illustration ‚ÄúAttitude to authority‚Äù. <br><br>  A boy named Mark wants to call his classmate Conner, who is very smart and understands Eastern markets, and seek advice about selling stocks.  But at first, he consults with his father, a great authority for him, although he does not have a cylinder or a monocle and is completely unaware of any securities markets, especially Eastern ones.  This comic book illustrates the power of authority and the fact that people are more willing to believe any nonsense, if they come from an authoritative person. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ty/5t/w8/ty5tw8vcc0n3l2tivjco1ar990g.jpeg"><br><br>  In the following picture, I will give an example of ‚ÄúAppeal to opportunities.‚Äù  He illustrates that most often you will receive the simplest answer to any question, not allowing other interpretations.  People may have different opinions on this issue, but the simplest answer leads, not allowing fluctuations, in which everything is unambiguous.  In other words, people prefer the answer that seems simpler and does not cause them to doubt.  Simple means the most correct and truthful, because what they do not understand and cannot explain, they consider to be a lie. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1l/cy/re/1lcyretl2elznn4v1zzcssp_mzu.jpeg"><br><br>  This is followed by a fragment, which is called "the negation of the previous."  This is an important aspect.  We can assume that the greatest examples of trolling are false calls to 911. First, we learn that the terrorists destroyed our CIA agents during the terrorist attacks on the twin towers, then we hear that the terrorists themselves were killed, and we take note of the latter, because she denies the previous one. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/o-/a9/nw/o-a9nwimhpmnvptr9mv2to5izd0.jpeg"><br><br>  And one more illustration called ‚ÄúArgumentation from ignorance‚Äù.  The whole evolution of humanity is built on arguments that arose from a lack of knowledge, that is, from ignorance.  But even now many statements are based on elementary ignorance of the subject.  Here in this picture guys dig up the bones of a dinosaur.  Everyone loves dinosaurs, they are part of our evolution.  The guys talk about what the role of God in evolution is, and whether evolution is compatible with God.  And Mark says that there is a "known known, known unknown and unknown unknown, and only the Bible can explain all this." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zq/zn/em/zqznemebmpgdns951tdgkvteggy.jpeg"><br><br>  The next comic is called ‚ÄúAdolf and Hans‚Äù, and I called the pictured situation ‚ÄúCorrelation errors‚Äù.  The principle of correlation is that changes in one thing causes a change in another, that is, they are interrelated.  The fact is that such an approach often misleads people, because it is never known whether this correlation is correct. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/su/4m/fp/su4mfpbslqsmklhsrmgggcsc-sk.jpeg"><br><br>  With the help of correlation errors, or correlation error, you can justify anything.  Based on the graphs, you can convince people of global warming or, conversely, of global cooling, justifying these findings by correlation analysis.  Such an approach can lead to catastrophic errors.  In the first frame, the boy tells his black girlfriend: ‚ÄúIt always surprises me why black guys are the first to die in horror films.‚Äù  Probably, he is not embarrassed to address such a question to a black woman, because he is a real Aryan.  Here is an example of a correlation error. <br><br>  This is followed by the comic book ‚ÄúYouth Camps in America‚Äù and a picture that I called ‚ÄúHistorical mistakes‚Äù.  This is a really inexhaustible topic, over which you can laugh heartily.  The guys are discussing the feat of 300 Spartans, knowing nothing about that era, nor about those people, nor about the circumstances of their life.  This creates tremendous opportunities for all sorts of assumptions, guesses and theories, that is, for trolling. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/of/h2/to/ofh2tofahr7agjm6t6umblqj_7m.jpeg"><br><br>  I called the following excerpt from the comic book ‚ÄúFake Choice.‚Äù  Fake choice means two possibilities - to turn the person‚Äôs opinion in the opposite direction or to take his brain for a long time with the problem of choosing the right solution.  You can completely chat a person with scientific terminology so that his eyes will close and he will fall asleep.  That is, instead of receiving important information for him, he will completely miss it. <br><br>  I called the following excerpt ‚ÄúUnder the influence of drink‚Äù.  For example, you say: ‚ÄúOh, yes, it‚Äôs great that you are against killing whales!  It is wonderful"!  But damn it, don't forget that whales are huge killing machines! <br><br>  Let's finish with the comics and consider the "Modification of behavior."  A lot of scientific research was devoted to this problem in the 50s, they were dealt with by people who wanted to confront the Communists, gays, fascists, and so on.  Sometimes this technology works, the behavior of people can be changed. <br><br>  And now we come to the most important part of my speech: "People are no different from software." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oa/9e/mb/oa9emb9iey_lprlelcpahwo4gwk.jpeg"><br><br><table><tbody><tr><th>  Programs: </th><th>  People: </th></tr><tr><td>  - unexpected intervention may cause instability; </td><td>  - unexpected intervention may cause instability; </td></tr><tr><td>  - long attempts to break the program can lead to an erroneous state; </td><td>  - long attempts to break the program can lead to an angry state; </td></tr><tr><td>  - looping and logical absurdities can block the work; </td><td>  - looping and logical absurdities can block the work; </td></tr><tr><td>  - The use of streaming information in programming can lead to increased priorities. </td><td>  - The use of streaming information in programming can lead to an increase in jokes. </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  This statement is an excellent base for trolling.  The following picture shows what the openfly v.1.1 bot is, the first bot I wrote.  I wrote it when I was still in college. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4n/tq/ic/4ntqicg4ncgny_dkdmckbomtsoi.jpeg"><br><br><ul><li>  simple variable random set of answers; </li><li>  a set of random interactions; </li><li>  targeted pursuit; </li><li>  I wrote to college so they let me go when I was in class. </li></ul><br>  This bot trolls people very successfully, generating random answers, and focused attention on those who answered it more often than others.  I did this for 3 or 4 weeks until I was tired of it, because the reaction of people was always the same - they began to argue with the bot. <br><br>  Consider how Martin and Peer describe 7 techniques for modifying human behavior: <br><br><ul><li>  We focus on certain behavioral issues that can be measured in some way; </li><li>  processing methods are ways of changing the normal state of an individual to help that individual function with full dedication; </li><li>  methods and rationale can be thoroughly described; </li><li>  techniques are often used in everyday life; </li><li>  mostly these techniques are based on the principles of learning; </li><li>  special conditions for the behavior modifier and its respondent; </li><li>  we place a strong emphasis on the scientific demonstration that a particular technique is responsible for a specific change in behavior; </li><li>  Special attention is paid to the accountability of everyone who participates in the behavior modification program. </li></ul><br>  I will tell you how I modified these 7 techniques for my needs: <br><br><ul><li>  emphasis is placed on certain behavioral issues that serve to make fun of a person; </li><li>  processing methods are ways to change the normal state of an individual in order to put this person in a foolish way; </li><li>  methods and justifications are chaotic in the best sense; </li><li>  techniques are often used in everyday life (on the 4chan forum board); </li><li>  mostly these techniques are based on the principles of trolling; </li><li>  special conditions for the behavior modifier and its respondent; </li><li>  Strong emphasis is placed on publicly demonstrating that a particular technique is responsible for concrete jokes; </li><li>  Special attention is paid to the complete lack of accountability for everyone who participates in trolling. </li></ul><br>  Consider that you need to use all sorts of proxies and hide your address during trolling, otherwise it will turn out the way it happened to me when I met the live object of my bullying and he recognized me.  It is better not to do that. <br><br>  The second version of my bot ‚Äúopenfly‚Äù 2.0 was called ‚ÄúSprayed Power‚Äù.  It was a hidden flood bot for the real-time IRC chat system.  It was used to flood by creating many unique ‚Äúnicknames‚Äù and worked on the basis of IRC scripts.  If I wanted to hammer in any channel of this ‚Äútalker‚Äù, I launched a bot there, and he used all the traffic.  People who tried to enter this channel saw that there was lively communication, but in reality it was my bots frolicking with each other, depicting active chat.  I used this technology on one of the German IRC channels, and they considered this a hacker attack. <br>  Therefore, using IRC or other forums, make sure that there are no people like me there, otherwise you will have a bad mood. <br><br>  I will try to describe you the technology of trolling.  This picture shows a very important thing - a 3D volume image of the trolling process.  What do you think it is?  If I say that this is a volume scan of my ass, will you be surprised? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ki/e_/oc/kie_oc8maerykugz9j8jxzkb44m.jpeg"><br><br>  This picture doesn‚Äôt mean anything at all, just in this way I‚Äôm kidding over you, depicting the scientific basis of trolling!  Here is another interesting thing - my arsenal.  Look at him, this is serious! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5m/wq/zm/5mwqzmzdlny0y_n96of7ppnkuyk.jpeg"><br><br>  Well, did you believe me?  In fact, I once felt so bored that I decided to put my mp3 player inside a hand grenade.  Looks cool!  It appeared in my blog, then on other resources, and one day I learned that the TSA security service, having discovered this post in my Flickr feed, forbade me to use airplanes. <br><br>  Another trick was the change of the barcode on the badges with which we attended one conference.  When scanning our badges on the monitor screen, the phrase ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù popped up, and the security guys pestered us for a long time asking how we could do it. <br><br>  Now the screen shows the folder program trollforge, "forge trolls."  This is a serious software that is used to bypass the various filters available on the forums. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/il/yj/ou/ilyjoux7i-6b6rxqsyl6qp1p3r0.jpeg"><br><br>  It was created within 4-5 years and even provides for the possibility of an automatic ‚Äúcaptcha‚Äù check, which is used to separate bots from real users.  This program successfully bypasses such a filter on any forum.  You can call this our "jokes security system." <br><br>  I want to show you a sample of fun spreading over the network.  It is called ‚ÄúMission Executable‚Äù and it sounds like this: ‚ÄúOver 9000 penises!  And they all raped children. ‚Äù  Imagine what kind of reaction this stuffing can cause on the forum.  Users are provided with a lesson for many, many hours, because many people believed that it was true!  They believed that there was such an organization that dealt with this.  This is my favorite trolling on the 4chan forum - so how can you not believe what Oprah Winfrey is saying! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ya/4k/ag/ya4kag_eqrk0rcltacszgils9_c.jpeg"><br><br>  Now consider the ethical aspect of trolling.  It is important.  If you are trolling people who understand that this is trolling, that's okay.  If you troll your friends, or even the entire Defcon network, there is no particular crime in this either.  And if you are trying to troll the Walmart store chain?  This is not so fun.  If you are at the wedding of your cousin, it is worth thinking about things that would be inappropriate in this case.  Therefore, the most important rule of trolling is this: You should not make trolling immoral, you should make it funny!  Simply put, if you are an eccentric with the letter ‚Äúm‚Äù, it‚Äôs better to be funny! <br><br>  So what have we learned?  What the trolls are: <br><br><ul><li>  make a significant contribution to the development of the culture and art of the Internet; </li><li>  are at the forefront of human behavior change technologies; </li><li>  determine the standards for the practical use of IT applications of the latest generation; </li><li>  Smarter, faster, stronger and better than ordinary people, therefore, are in demand as genetic partners. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hi/sg/qr/hisgqrhuneclmzhj9n8xppitwiw.jpeg"><br><br>  I believe that every hacker is a troll, because he uses the same principles of behavior.  Over the years, I made sure that all the hackers I knew began with trolls.  Back in college, we witnessed how one guy was involved in creating a hacker program, and the way he did it was pretty funny.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The main thing is that in most cases it is just funny, otherwise there is a chance to go to jail. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now regarding the technology of behavior modification. You can have fun, like my friends, in Google+ or Facebook chat rooms, where they created a non-existent woman named Robin Sage, and then some people claimed to know her personally. You can create thousands of characters on social networks, and people will begin to communicate with them, and you can control their behavior with the help of bots. This can be a problem when people really believe that they communicate with the same real people. They will actually begin to obey machines, bots, and act like robots themselves. Therefore, the trolls are indeed in the forefront of social behavior manipulation technologies.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Trolls have an impact on the development of modern software, for example, upgrading the procedure for identifying users of forums and other resources that use ‚Äúcaptcha‚Äù to enter or send a form with a response. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Scripts to distinguish a bot from a person are constantly being improved. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We use new forms of registration and authorization on the forums, so we should not fall behind. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What are we doing at all? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We have the fate of the people! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can take it as another joke.</font></font><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ab9xV5bmIH8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Thank you for staying with us.
