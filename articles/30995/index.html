In a revolutionary short time, a little less than three years, our factory was converted to the production of pressed boots.  Boots are in great demand among residents of the city.  Behind this lies an invaluable contribution to the cause of the people of Comrade Kim Yun Hwan, our valiant director. <br>  This is how workers of the Renson factory of pressed boots, whose workers are mostly disabled in military service (?), Speak of their leader.  A few years earlier, a factory in the suburb of Pyongyang produced only brushes (?). <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Kim Yun Hwan, demobilized due to injury during military service (?), Was appointed factory director three years ago.  After taking office, Comrade Khvan familiarized himself with the state of affairs, and also already then thought about the prospects for the work of the factory. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/669/9db/9c4/6699db9c405060775297876598a2fb05.jpg" width="450" height="234" alt="Pressing shop" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  ‚ÄúWe, the disabled military service, the state provides all possible benefits.  In turn, we did nothing worthy in response to this.  We need to think about the development of the factory, as required by the developing reality. ‚Äù

      Comrade Hwan shared his thoughts with the workers: ‚ÄúAlthough we are disabled, we must live in a revolutionary military spirit, as in the years of military service.‚Äù  After these words, the director called on the workers to turn the factory into a base for the production of pressed boots to help improve people's livelihood. <br><br>  The director‚Äôs initiative was supported by the workers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/e30/6f5/8bb/e306f58bb34a02b8aea4b9fc8891d122.jpg" width="450" height="395" alt="Work days" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  Comrade Hwang, always bring to the end what has been started.  Having carefully studied all the advanced achievements of science and technology of the footwear industry, the director immediately began to introduce them into production, while simultaneously conducting and reconstructing the factory. <br><br>  The director was constantly among the workers, continually participating in the assembly of machines, sometimes he himself became a machine tool.  Thanks to inexhaustible energy and will, the director managed to set up the entire production process in the shortest possible time, starting from the procurement of raw materials and ending with the pressing of the finish (?).  The factory released its first batch of boots. <br><br>  "On the basis of the progress achieved in production, a new method was applied, which allowed replacing most of the raw materials with domestic ones while reducing costs and increasing real profits." (Did not dare to translate, approx. Lane.) <br><br>  Currently, the factory produces beautiful and high-quality boots of more than ten colors (?), Including the use of two-tone paint. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/6a6/124/cbe/6a6124cbe753197d3af2bd710cb62975.jpg" width="450" height="165" alt="Our products are the pride of our country" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  In October 2006, Kim Jong Il, having examined the products of this factory, highly appreciated the work of the director, saying that the boots are beautiful, both in terms of color and shape;  thereby encouraging director Kim Yun Hwan. <br><br>  After these words, the director promised the president to increase production, for which he vowed that he would give all his experience, intelligence and energy to his work. <br><br>  The original material can be <a href="http://www.kcckp.net/ru/periodic/korea/index.php%3Fcontents%2B1685%2B2007-04%2B63%2B23">viewed</a> in the online version of Korea Magazine. <br><br>  Ps.  He broke his head wondering if the director of Windows XP is installed (a blue bar of a task bar at the bottom of the image on the monitor, and it was not possible to recognize the program running on the computer. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/30995/">https://habr.com/ru/post/30995/</a></p>
