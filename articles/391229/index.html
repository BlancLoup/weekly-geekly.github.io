Today it makes no sense to put a CISS on the legendary Epson Stylus Photo P50, when you can buy a similar printer with a guarantee from the manufacturer. <br><br>  In this post, we describe the main models of the series, their main "chips", and also tell a little story about their appearance in Russia.

      By the way, according to the data of the independent research agency IDC, in 2014-2015, the Epson Printing Factory series took the <b>1st place</b> in sales of inkjet devices in Russia (that is, according to the data of the independent agency IDC, in 2014-2015, our company occupied the largest share rykjnyj devices of Russia and the CIS countries in money). <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/435/8e1/138/4358e1138bf84955a4fd1a1311dc33c4.jpg" align="right"><h2>  Brief background </h2><br>  A few years ago, manufacturers of printing devices made the main profit not from the sale of equipment, but from the sale of consumables to it.  That is why many third-party organizations began to offer their services to install the so-called.  ‚ÄúContinuous ink supply systems‚Äù (CISS) for cartridge printers.  The solution had both advantages (obvious savings on consumption) and disadvantages (deprivation of warranty, problems with ‚Äúleft‚Äù inks, which slowly put the print head out of order, often - leakage of poor-quality ink tanks, etc ...) <br><br>  In 2011, the Epson company took a risk and radically changed the business model.  The printer began to cost exactly as much as it is in production, and the cost of ink has decreased several times, while their number has grown 10 times! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/36c/8a0/54a/36c8a054a2cb4cc0aa459bd883e9e518.jpg" align="right">  Epson engineers suggested an alternative: they did not just install an ink tank into the printer, but made it as reliable as possible, integrated the ink pressure monitoring system directly into the printer so that the ink was evenly fed to the ink and the print quality remained.  The company's engineers also thought up the convenience of refueling, ease of transportation and compactness of new devices.  All this made it possible to abandon the cartridge and significantly reduce the cost of printing. <br><br>  Ask, why is this solution better than ‚Äúartisanal‚Äù CISS?  Yes, at least by the fact that it is an engineering <b>solution for mass production, time-tested, and with a guarantee of quality from a Japanese manufacturer of equipment</b> .  Simply put - "bought and use." <br><br>  Ink for the Epson Printing Factory series is supplied in 70 and 140 ml containers.  This is ten times more than an ordinary Epson inkjet printer cartridge.  As a result, today's models of the Print Factory series are sold with a <b>starter ink set, which is enough for 6,500 color and 11,000 b / w prints</b> !  (depending on model) <br><br><h2>  Bestsellers </h2><br>  In order not to spread the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe tree, we will tell the main "chips" of the most popular and important models that are presented in the current line of devices.  So let's go! <br><br><h2>  Printers for printing color documents </h2><br>  ‚ÄúChetrekhtsvetniki‚Äù are the most ‚Äúpopular‚Äù printers and multifunctional devices, of which I would like to separately distinguish the following models: <br><br><h3>  Epson L366 MFP </h3><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8f7/1a0/3eb/8f71a03eb251420fa00d9f2bb0171fb0.jpg"></div><br>  The model that came to replace the popular Epson L355.  If you are looking for a universal all-in-one device, take an <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/printers/epson-l366/">Epson L366</a> .  He can very much, namely: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>The resource of the starter ink kit is enough for 6500 color and 4000 b / w A4 prints!</b> <b><br></b>  <b>This is more than 20 packs of office paper of 500 sheets.</b> </li><li>  Prints a photo 10x15 cm borderless.  Of course, printing photos on the four-flower - ‚Äúnot hard‚Äù, but you can have the opportunity to print photos in the photo album on this model as well, and the quality of the photos is remarkable.  You can see this <a href="http://epson.ru/demo/">in one of our demo rooms</a> at any convenient time. </li><li>  Prints quickly - up to 33 pages per minute. </li><li>  It has a built-in scanner for quick copying and scanning photos and documents. </li><li>  Prints and scans over WiFi (including from smartphones via the Epson iPrint application). </li><li>  Very compact.  48.2 √ó 14.5 √ó 30 cm (W √ó H √ó D) </li></ul><br><h3>  Epson L655 MFP </h3><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1f1/0bc/f15/1f10bcf15a2648fba620455516b0197a.jpg"></div><br>  Line devices are constantly evolving.  Meet the novelty - <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/printers/epson-l655/">Epson L655</a> - the first color "Printing Factory" with black pigment ink.  Unlike other color printers, which print both images and text with water-soluble ink, this MFP prints black in such a way that it will not take any attack: you can not wash it with water, you can not smear it with a marker.  Epson L655 is a great solution for a small office, because to all the "chips" that L366 has, it adds: <br><br><ul><li>  Full Epson Connect support.  The printer can be connected wirelessly to anything at all. </li><li>  It can be connected to a wired Ethernet network. </li><li>  It supports automatic duplex printing!  This is the first "Factory" with a similar opportunity. </li></ul><br>  The picture is worth a thousand words, so the rest of the features Epson L655 will tell a visual video: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/dFI2a19dajc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhg3jHA2HoL0lHzxRWagMHB1RrNskw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h3>  Epson L1300 - A3 + Printer </h3><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/328/ef6/9b7/328ef69b7e1643e1a311378d2d6494cb.jpg"></div><br>  Yes, ‚ÄúPrint Factory‚Äù is not only compact printers, but also ‚Äúmedium format‚Äù printers in sizes up to A3 +.  <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/printers/epson-l1300/">Epson L1300</a> is the first <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/printers/epson-l1300/">sign</a> that has already become popular in many organizations, where it is often necessary to print working documents and charts in large format.  In particular, the network of popular sports shops Sport Master uses these devices for printing. <br><br>  JTB Russia advertising agency told us about its successful use of the printer: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/hHEuDpIaWaY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjilRNOYp15dRwelX849gV44b53Dg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  If you are planning to print photos in sizes up to A3 +, pay attention to the <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/epson/blog/391229/">Epson L1800</a> , which is described below. <br><br><h2>  Photo Printers </h2><br>  It is difficult to imagine a line of modern printing devices without photo printers and multifunction printers.  These 6-color devices will allow even the most demanding photographers to get prints of excellent quality.  And together with the highest efficiency devices, we get an extremely attractive offer for photographers "of any caliber."  How to change cartridges, where it is easier to buy a printer with a pre-installed CISS and print, "how many will fit", is not it? <br><br>  In general, with the printing at the ‚ÄúPrint Factory‚Äù there is a special story.  It is the <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/printers/epson-l800/">Epson L800</a> photo <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/printers/epson-l800/">printer that</a> became the very <b>first device in the line</b> .  He still occupies the first lines in a variety of tops of the most popular inkjet printers ( <a href="https://market.yandex.ru/catalog/54546/list%3Fhid%3D138608%26gfilter%3D2142569576%253A-1609284019">for example</a> ).  We will tell about his descendants, who have become even better and more functional. <br><br>  If you wish, you can also familiarize yourself with our <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/epson/blog/247598/">previous post about photo line printers</a> . <br><br><h3>  Epson L805 Photo Printer </h3><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9d7/935/f00/9d7935f00baa422f855a13570eec257b.jpg"></div><br>  The printer, which came to replace the legendary Epson L800.  The main and main difference is the support for connecting via a wireless Wi-Fi network, which the first model lacked so much.  Otherwise, the <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/printers/epson-l805/">Epson L805</a> is still the same time-tested Epson L800, with a slightly improved hardware.  If you need one of the most successful and profitable options for photo printing on the market (we declare without exaggeration and boasting) - take Epson L805, you will not regret. <br><br><br><br><h3>  Epson L850 MFP </h3><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/771/088/bf9/771088bf91764e53806591b4b30f0a4e.jpg"></div><br>  From tradition to innovation - meet the novelty - <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/printers/epson-l850/">Epson L850</a> .  It can be called the flagship of the "Photographic Printing Stamp" A4 format.  What is there in him and what he just does not know: <br><br><ul><li>  Allows you to print at all without a computer, thanks to the built-in LCD screen </li><li>  Prints from SD memory cards, directly from cameras and USB-carriers (Pictbridge) </li><li>  Print on CD and DVD </li><li>  And, of course, has all the other "chips" inherent in the traditional Epson MFP </li></ul><br>  If you need a real "universal soldier" who prints anything in the format up to A4 - take this model. <br><br>  Epson L850 Review from Compress.ru: <a href="http://compress.ru/post/20150202-epson-l850">www.compress.ru/post/20150202-epson-l850</a> <br><br><a name="L1800"></a><h3>  Epson L1800 - A3 + photo printer </h3><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b88/6ae/114/b886ae114f0f4e4b8716b5cf2270bf6c.jpg"></div><br>  The logical continuation of the case of the legendary Epson L800 sooner or later was to be the emergence of "Photographic Factory" A3 format.  Meet  <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/printers/epson-l1800/">Epson L1800</a> - <b>A3 + photo printer with built-in ink tanks instead of cartridges</b> .  Who would have thought that one day a big brand would officially release such a miracle ... However, it happened. <br><br>  Sredneformatnik with CISS is the dream of any serious photographer, as well as a small photo workshop.  Now you do not need to redo Epson Stylus Photo 1410, but you can immediately buy the device for the most economical photo printing with a manufacturer‚Äôs warranty. <br><br>  Natalia Udartseva, Director of the School of Visual Arts shared her experience with Epson L1800 with us: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/wXV3MatabPA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgBDUP1HWon6gVIS1vmlomQja0TJg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h2>  Epson monochrome printers and multifunction printers </h2><br>  Modern monochrome printers are intended primarily for printing archival documentation.  This is due to the fact that <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/factory-mono/">monochrome printers and Epson Print MFPs</a> come with pigment black inks that are not afraid of either water or the effects of the marker, and also very durable and do not crumble like toner after long-term storage.  In addition, printers are supplied with ink containers twice the volume - 140 ml.  These devices for supereconomic printing of black and white documents will find application in a small and medium office, a state or educational institution. <br><br><h3>  Epson M200 MFP </h3><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f91/505/4a1/f915054a1ad04aea9c299b1e2fa649dd.jpg"></div><br>  The flagship line of monochrome printers of the Print Factory series is the <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/printers/epson-m200/">Epson M200</a> : <br><br><ul><li>  Is able to do everything that a typical MFP can </li><li> There is an automatic feeder for scanning documents on 30 sheets </li><li>  Works on an Ethernet network </li><li>  And, of course, the ink starter kit - 11,000 prints! </li></ul><br><h2>  Some history and facts for those who are interested. </h2><br>  Russia is one of the first countries where the Epson Print Factory series devices were launched for the first time.  In 2011, the project was launched with Epson L100 4-color printers, Epson L200 multifunction printers and Epson L800 6-color photo printers.  And only in 2014, printers of the series appeared in Europe under the Epson EcoTank brand. <br><br>  Then came the world's first non-inkjet monochrome printers with the M index (Epson M105 / M205), which became very popular in government agencies and private offices as an alternative to monochrome laser printers.  And they were followed by A3 + format printers: four-color Epson L1300 and 6-color Epson L1800. <br><br>  By the way, according to our internal data, every 3rd small or mobile photo center in Russia uses the Epson L800 Printing Factory for quick photo printing.  Recently, the Epson L800 begins to occupy the place of Epson L1800 due to its "medium format". <br><br><h2>  Awards </h2><br>  In addition to our own positive (what a surprise!)
