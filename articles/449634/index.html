From the moment of the appearance of the first robotic coffee shops and shops without service personnel, every day seems to me like dreams come true about a convenient and comfortable world.  We have long gone to the possibility of driving a car, a house, our life from a telephone.  There were a lot of crashes, hacks, leaks of personal data and ships, but now the future has come.  And I am delighted. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I leave the office, with one voice command I order myself a coffee, which will be ready exactly by the time I get to the machine with a large iron hand.  No contact with the barista, questions about the syrup and flavorings.  Everything is as simple as possible: I press the button, say that I want to order, the coffee machine determines my location, calculates how soon I will be in place, decrypts my message, and - lo and behold!  - cooks exactly the coffee that I ask.  It only remains for me to go to the vending machine, provide a QR code and pick up the drink from an iron hand.  With these machines we had problems, cunning idlers arranged the whole floods due to software flaws.  The problem was known in 2015, but everyone was not in a hurry to fix it until the losses from the intruders did not exceed the cost of eliminating the vulnerability.  The essence of hacking the coffee house was that the attacker intercepted control over the machine and sent out regular requests for making coffee.  Every time there was a new coffee river, a bunch of passers-by filmed a video and posted a Storiz.  So in some ways it was an advertisement. <br><br>  Spilled coffee fades on the background of free gasoline.  We mainly use electric machines, but classic refills still occur.  Especially in old cities.  And the speakers there did not change at least an eternity!  Just imagine, back in 2018, all sorts of cunning could force the column to give out gasoline for free to everyone.  The main problem was that the pump was disconnected from the terminal and the equipment was working offline.  Now it is not so easy to crank, but the craftsmen are still there.  And the cost of such services is space.  It is much easier to order a hacking hover. <br><br>  Why break a hoverboard?  You are not from this century, honestly!  When not everyone knew about the vulnerability, it was a great way to fine-tune an accident.  Here is a happy businessman.  He rides quietly on a hoverboard from the gym to the office.  And then at some point the management is intercepted, and the faithful piece of iron takes the businessman right under the wheels of the car.  The police puzzled for a long time what could have happened to a healthy and an adult to rush under the wheels of a car like this.  Mystical deaths would continue for a long time, until the researchers found vulnerability in hoverboards.  This ‚Äúhole‚Äù was written back in 2017. An attacker could easily connect to a hoverboard via Bluetooth, enter a regular password of 4 zeros, upload his software and take control of the device.  But then the news did not cause a resonance, and everything was forgotten.  And vulnerability traveled from model to model.  Only the deaths of the ‚Äúyoung and successful‚Äù attracted enough attention to the problem, and most of the hoverboard are now considered safe.

      In general, the death occurred motivates manufacturers to ‚Äúpatch holes‚Äù much faster than its perceived risk.  For example, it took about 16 cases with a lethal outcome to solve problems with gyroscooters.  When one of the medical corporations that produce pacemakers advised to attend to the safety of their devices, the representatives reacted quite coolly.  Just think, since 2018 there has been a vulnerability in the devices, which allows to seize control of the device and literally stop a sore heart.  These guys from the medical center did not move until 7 deaths were recorded due to the vulnerability of the pacemaker, which disrupted the frequency of electrical discharges.  And now, after a month and a half, all the ‚Äúholes‚Äù were closed, which is extremely fast, according to our standards. <br>  I look forward to when hackers can turn the floor into lava so that they can pay attention to the problem with the remote temperature change in the rooms.  But it is rather a dream.  Now everyone is extremely passionate about collecting personal information.  Even thermometers, honestly. <br><br>  The first time I paid attention to this was when I saw an advertisement for a ‚Äútherapist at home‚Äù after a couple of minutes, as I measured the temperature with a ‚Äúsmart‚Äù thermometer.  He showed 40 ¬∞, I estimated how much work would have to be entrusted to my colleagues, a cheerful advertisement of the medical center began to play on the screen.  I did not immediately connect these two events.  A week later, as I began to recover, the screen was already showing ads for firming vitamins.  I admit honestly, I purchased the whole complex, without thinking.  And only then I realized that the thermometer here was a link between me and the advertisers.  I do not remember signing any papers for data transfer to third parties.  In general, the vitamins helped me, so I am not particularly angry with the ‚Äúsmart spy‚Äù. <br><br>  This chill ran down my back when I saw an advertisement for baby carriages.  The point is not in the advertising itself.  Prams are great, they have so many cool features, almost a children's car.  The fact is that after the advertisement was played, and the broadcast of the match returned to the screen, my wife approached me with the newfangled and most accurate pregnancy test.  With two stripes.  It seemed to me to be the ghosts of the past.  Yes, the tests broke in 2019 or 2020.  And there were massive leaks.  But now that such information was transmitted to the cloud and so easily used - I was shocked, but said nothing. <br><br>  After about 8 months, our entire broadcast was filled with advertisements for children's toys and girl dolls.  It seemed to his wife that this was an incredible coincidence, and we simply must buy a talking bear in a three-piece suit.  It seemed to me that the ‚Äúbig marketing brother‚Äù knows too much.  But the bear was nice, and I respect the classics.  It‚Äôs even scary to think what a mistake it was. <br><br>  Our daughter constantly spent time with the bear.  With it, you could send her messages remotely and listen to what she was answering.  The first words she said to this bear, when I said good night to her, being on a business trip.  And she listened to the bear much more often.  Only he could make her remove the toys and finish eating the porridge.  The bear had a camera in the eye, so that at any moment we could see what was happening with the child.  And, unfortunately, this function was used not only by us.  Found the "animal", which offered the girl to play.  Collect all of my mother's beautiful jewelery and father's watches, fold them into a box and leave them in the yard.  In the evening the elves will come and in exchange for the box will make the bear alive.  Apparently, the attacker was sitting in a toy for a very long time and he knew how everything worked out here.  And he knew about the unconditional trust in the bear.  Everything worked out: we paid attention to the box in the yard until it was empty.  The game could be worse, for example, to set fire to all the books to summon the fire fairies.  It seemed to me that the vulnerabilities in children's toys were finished in 2014, well, maybe in 2018.  There have been so many vulnerabilities and scandals associated with this.  Robot-nannies who frightened children at night, hackers who viewed the apartment with the help of cameras in children's dolls.  And the "holes" are still there.  We disconnected the bear from the Internet, without it it became much more difficult to communicate with her daughter, she could not get used to the fact that the toy no longer speaks.  After a while, the bear was replaced by a smart watch with cubs.  This is the latest model, and the developers swear that everything is as safe as possible.  We will live and see, but for the time being there is no reason not to trust them. <br><br>  Yes, the world knows everything about me.  But I agree to this fee for convenience.  After all, the future is great. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/449634/">https://habr.com/ru/post/449634/</a></p>
