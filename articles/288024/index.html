How are you still working? <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  The ‚Äú <a href="http://usabilist.de/">Searching for Usability</a> ‚Äù blog tells the story <a href="http://usabilist.de/seeking/ru/fantasy-of-the-wacom-developers">of the painful search</a> for a power connector on a tablet.  As a result, convenience is not always justified.

      " <a href="http://superkino.ru/">Filmblog</a> " marked a note is not about the movie.  <a href="http://superkino.ru/vsyakoe/chego-hochet-norvezhskaya-zhenschina">What does a Norwegian woman want?</a>  - this is the question of this week.  The author of the blog reflects on the results of a survey of thousands of Norwegian women aged from 18 to 84 years on the subject of their erotic fantasies.  Do you think Slavic men need it? <br><br>  Quite recently, the blog " <a href="http://interbiz.ru/">Internet business today</a> " has appeared and has already managed to gain popularity.  First of all, it is connected with original and interesting articles that appear on this blog.  I will not give links to each of them, but rather I will immediately give a link to the blog - <a href="http://interbiz.ru/">interbiz.ru</a> .  In the last week, for example, it was possible to read that ‚ÄúThe <i>blogger to the splogger is not a friend</i> ,‚Äù ‚Äú <i>23,000 visitors a day is a tribute to beautiful criticism</i> ,‚Äù ‚Äú <i>Yahoo launches advertising via RSS channels</i> ,‚Äù ‚Äú <i>Live magazines break the fates of teenagers</i> ,‚Äù ‚Äú <i>Zalez Is Google not on its plate?</i> "and much more. <br><br>  <a href="http://dp76.com/log/">Silver</a> in his notes was marked by a remarkable <a href="http://dp76.com/log/424">poem</a> , authorship, unfortunately, is not known.  " <i>Everything is terrible, it is shaky in life. In general, I want to be a fish!</i> " <br><br>  I recommend to look at the blog <a href="http://yakoff.ru/">yakoff.ru</a> at the same address.  The author, unfortunately, does not indulge us with frequent updates, the latter was already at the end of October, but even that which is is very interesting.  For example, a post about diving, which smoothly flows into the instruction on the fight with a yawn.  Or a story about how the author was mistaken for a spy. <br><br>  The Argentine schist and spy <a href="http://slaff.net/">slaff</a> does not miss any of our reviews.  He now finds himself with a sentimental story about careless work with the name " <a href="http://slaff.net/2005/11/16/28-kompyuterov-i-1-ya">28 computers and 1 me</a> ."  Easy money was very hard. <br><br>  Another of our regular guests is <a href="http://merkurov.ru/blog/">Merkurov</a> (no one knows his name, not even himself!).  This time he is pleased with the note <a href="http://merkurov.ru/blog/2005/11/17/419">Pustyachkov</a> .  Ponochy, according to Merkurov, is freedom of speech on the Internet and a reflection on whether it is beneficial for the state to block access to the Internet. <br><br>  Blog <a href="http://register.intruder.ru/">intruder's register</a> wants to take the bread from me and chew it myself.  Okay, I will spare you from allegories, also a small <a href="http://register.intruder.ru/2005/11/16/prosto-neskolko-ssyilok-6">overview of interesting notes</a> on blogs, only English-language blogs were overlooked.  In addition, I recommend to all site owners to pay attention to the post " <a href="http://register.intruder.ru/2005/11/18/zabavyi-s-google-sitemap">Fun with Google Sitemap</a> ", which describes in detail what can be done with this service. <br><br>  <a href="http://strannick.blogspot.com/">StraNN'e place</a> was not even strange, but familiar - now it is a frequenter of our reviews.  Over the past week - as many as two messages that deserve attention.  First, the fact that Google has created a <a href="http://strannick.blogspot.com/2005/11/google.html">service for video sharing</a> , and secondly, <a href="http://strannick.blogspot.com/2005/11/blog-post_20.html">about the site frappr.com</a> , which allows all followers of the Firefox browser (and what there are others?) Mark yourself on the world map. <br><br>  <a href="http://ptath.ru/">Plath.ru</a> talks about his experience of communicating with <a href="http://ptath.ru/2005/11/16/vindus-zhiv">Microsoft's new Internet service</a> , Live.com.  Despite the fact that the author notes: " <i>No words, some emotions,</i> " the words were still there.  For example, such: " <i>Then hotmail itself is just a hurricane =) A two megabyte box with a completely wild interface and a bunch of restrictions is just something. I don‚Äôt understand Russian letters, I sent a letter to myself - the questions came</i> ." <br><br>  <a href="http://lifehack.ru/">LifeHack.ru</a> exactly corresponds to its name and now with my help it hacks the life of two billion people (after all, so much reads "Computer News").  Hacking will happen <a href="http://lifehack.ru/2005/11/19/eda_par_i_chistye_mikrovolny">through the microwave</a> .  So how do you wash it?  And that's wrong!  And how correctly, Lifehack tells us. <br><br>  <a href="http://gordy.ru/">Gordy</a> boastfully talks about how lucky he was to <a href="http://gordy.ru/archives/27">go to the concert of</a> Natalie Imbruly.  And we are not even jealous of him, because we have our own Tihanovich with Poplavskaya and various bourgeois stars we don‚Äôt need!  After all, really, yes?  (We close in the bathroom and we sob there.) <br><br>  Another blog that has too many interesting posts this week to recommend them individually - <a href="http://mastertext.spb.ru/blog">AD_BLOG</a> .  A blog about advertising solutions, in particular, and about advertising, in general.  I liked the notes about Australian Chupa Chups advertising;  about the Philips commercial for the shaver, in which they are pinned to the Gillete razors with 15 blades;  touching Belgian appeals to donate blood;  and Laima Vaikule - the face of "Megaphone". <br><br>  <a href="http://pixeblog.com/">Anelka</a> continues to frighten us with tales of a meeting with <a href="http://pixeblog.com/pixel/93">herbalons</a> at <a href="http://pixeblog.com/pixel/93">night</a> , however, this time everything ends without bloodshed. <br><br>  Traditionally, apart from the rest, we pay attention to Belarusian blogs. <br><br>  <a href="http://hvost.org/">HvosT</a> publishes an interesting and useful article <a href="http://hvost.org/%3Fp%3D120">on reading software</a> for Palm.  In addition to the programs themselves, there is also a small collection of links - where you can find e-books. <br><br>  <a href="http://jamshid.ru/">Jamshid is</a> saddened that after 30 years of existence, the program ‚Äú <a href="http://jamshid.ru/2005/11/15/v-mire-zhivotnyih-rip">In the Animal World</a> ‚Äù will no longer be published, after which he <a href="http://jamshid.ru/2005/11/15/google-analytics">complains about</a> the whole of Google and Google Analytics, in particular.  Even threatens to sell his shares of Google, if he had them.  And I would buy them from him if I had money. <br><br>  And in our blue-eyed republic has its own service for blogs.  There, too, you can find some interesting diaries and notes.  For example, mzaa talks about how to correctly tip, and in linux magazine (not to be confused with the OS of the same name!), <a href="http://inf.by/linux/91">We will compare the</a> cost of one megabyte of data on various media - from hard disk to flash. <br><br>  LiveJournal will not die in any way (and what are the prerequisites?), So you can read some interesting notes in LJ. <br><br>  There is a community of people in LJ who love various intellectual games, and in particular ‚ÄúWhat?  Where?  When? ‚ÄùAnd there appeared a <a href="http://livejournal.com/community/chgk/186487.html">note about appeals</a> to non-credited responses from one regional game.  There is a lot of text, even a hamster like me didn‚Äôt master everything, but it‚Äôs fun to read a little.  For example: " <i>Our team asks to count the answer" The Tasting Room "as equivalent to the author's" Laundry</i> "." <br><br>  Despite the fact that the national library is promised to be opened only in the spring, there were people who had already been inside the diamond and did not forget to take a camera with them.  Some Ukurka shares his <a href="http://livejournal.com/users/ukurka/19336.html">impressions and photos</a> .  There are a lot of impressions and photos to satisfy national curiosity. <br><br>  The community of the hero-city of Minsk continues to discuss the imminent opening of the Belarusian silicon valley and offers an advertising symbol - <a href="http://livejournal.com/community/minsk_by/628760.html">Larisa Dolina</a> and an advertising slogan: ‚Äú <i>Silicon Valley - a Symbol of Belarus!</i> ‚Äù Honestly, Larisa is a pity. <br><br>  Nadina in her LiveJournal raises the burning theme of promiscuity of modern youth or simply - ‚Äú <a href="http://livejournal.com/users/nadina/481594.html">Oh, the times! Oh, the mores!</a> ‚Äù. <br><br>  It seems that today's review will be with a bias in erotica.  So wildmale could not resist and published a huge story <a href="http://livejournal.com/users/wildmale/58457.html">about swingers</a> .  Household irony and splatter, laughter cuts out with a bang: " <i>Karinin bespectacled man - he never took off his glasses - he huddled into a corner and looked around from there intimidated. I decided to change tactics and whispered to Karina in my ear to take him by the fold on the belly and dragged here, in general fun</i> . " <br><br>  Vladbunim tells a story from his medical practice, which occurred as early as 1961.  And made in our Belarusian city of Cherven, which is 60 km from Minsk.  The story is called " <a href="http://livejournal.com/users/vladbunim/13879.html">The sanction of the prosecutor</a> " and, for example, reminds me of my barefoot Soviet childhood. <br><br>  <b>Alexey Khaletsky</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://kv.by/index2005470604.htm">Published in "Computer News" (‚Ññ47, 2005)</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288024/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288024/</a></p>
