The first post of product metrics can be found <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/ringcloud/blog/14380/">here</a> .  For May we had a lot of interesting initiatives.  Something happened, but we decided to do something in a different direction.  Getting started‚Ä¶ <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  For those who read us for the first time, who are we? </h4><br>  Since June 2014, we have been developing a <a href="http://ringcloud.ru/">virtual PBX for RingCloud business</a> .  In August, we conducted a beta test of the product, in which more than 300 testers took part (here you can read more about this), in October we started selling the service to the first users, simultaneously improving the product based on their responses, and in February of this year we went to full production. fully armed.

    <h4>  Traffic totals </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/63d/e83/de2/63de83de2cd748598fe6233f204b3765.png"><br><br>  Despite the comatose state of users in the first half of the month, we managed to revive attendance at the expense of posts, TV series translations and contextual advertising (it worked, in fact, only in the last two weeks).  As a result, we lost not much traffic.  For June, plans are even more Napoleonic.  It remains only to take and make. <br><br><h4>  REST API </h4><br>  In May, as we planned, <a href="https://api.ringcloud.ru/docs/">our API and a detailed description of it were released</a> .  It should be noted that we are one of the few virtual PBXs that provide such a wide range of functions for working with the system through the API.  In fact, almost all cloud / virtual PBXs work like a ‚Äúbox‚Äù on an external server and limit the freedom of users.  If you are wondering how and on what our API was raised, you can read a detailed <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/ringcloud/blog/258311/">post on Habr√©</a> .  There, our lead developer clearly described everything with code and other technical features. <br><br><h4>  Tariff Plans </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e39/d14/c9c/e39d14c9ce0f4a69bac0be2cfdf42ee7.png"><br><br>  In a previous post, I wrote that we are starting full-scale testing of the demand for a product in the context of various tariff plans.  At the end of the month, we decided to leave the complex line with four tariffs, which segmented users by the number of employees.  Now we have only two easy to understand tariffs - for one employee (interesting for freelancers and other start-up entrepreneurs) and unlimited tariff (closes all other categories of business).  In each of these tariffs, we have invested full functionality without any restrictions.  The task for May is to fix the increase in sales.  :) <br><br>  It turned out to be especially nice for those users who were originally on more expensive tariff plans.  Now for them the <a href="http://ringcloud.ru/tarif.php">use of a virtual PBX RingCloud</a> has become even more profitable. <br><br><h4>  Project Mars + New RingCloud ID Concept </h4><br>  I wrote about this in the last post.  Now the idea is overgrown with normal TZ and tasks within our project manager.  I will not give information on the project itself, as it is a secret, but you can already speak on the RingCloud ID. <br><br>  In essence, the current user account of the administrator (the owner of the virtual PBX domain) is reformatted into a central account for all our products.  After authorization, the user will fall into an ecosystem of integrated products that can be activated to use as all at once, and in any desired order.  We will let the user start automating his business from any direction (solving many already known ‚Äúpains‚Äù of start-up entrepreneurs) and only increasing the number of automated processes in the future.  And all this within the framework of one system with a single account and balance.  Delivery of the project Mars is scheduled for early July.  Then you will see both RingCloud ID and a new product from our team. <br><br><h4>  Thank! </h4><br>  If there is any comment or question on the project, then write below.  I will try to promptly give an answer.  Well, put the "up arrow" for Arnie;) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/291166/">https://habr.com/ru/post/291166/</a></p>
