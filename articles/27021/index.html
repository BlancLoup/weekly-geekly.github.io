Today we will talk about the "reverse side of the coin." <br><br>  The question is relevant and exciting.  And many freelancers do not know what to do and as a result work and work and work, stress increases, nervous breakdowns, problems in life ... <br><br>  If you know how to work with clientele and do your job well and efficiently, then sooner or later there comes a time when there is more work than hours in a day, and it‚Äôs not convenient to refuse customers.

      Therefore, I will try in this note to collect all the methods I know (some of them have been tested, some I heard from other freelancers I respect) and put the methods together. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  So what can you do: <ol><li>  <strong>Transfer work to others.</strong>  Try to find freelancers of their specialization and transfer the work to them.  You can also find yourself "apprentices" and do the work with their hands, making a profit.  However, be prepared for the fact that a lot of time will have to be spent on training these people, otherwise customers will understand that the work is not done by you. </li><li>  <strong>Refuse orders.</strong>  Not the best way, but sometimes it is useful if you are fed up with work or have no time for it at all.  Sometimes it's better to refuse than to take up an order and not to make it and let the customer down </li><li>  <strong>Raise prices.</strong>  This cuts off customers who are not very interested in you.  At the expense of raising prices, orders will be less, but due to a change in prices - the total income will not decrease, and even vice versa - will increase.  The main thing to know when to stop.  The price should not "jump" at times </li><li>  <strong>Take only interesting orders for themselves</strong> </li><li>  <strong>Use the services of a project manager.</strong>  Not all freelancers have the right skills in communicating with customers and selling their work.  This will allow you to get more time for a ‚Äúclean‚Äù job. </li><li>  <strong>Give the customer a choice.</strong>  The essence of this action is to "force" the customer to outbid you.  If there are several parallel orders, inform the customer that another customer for similar work (if this is true) offers more money and you are interested in taking that order, and not this one.  Works only for very experienced freelancers who have proven their professionalism. </li><li>  <strong>Work, work, work ..</strong> If you are a fan of work and do not want to do anything except work, then this option is for you.  However, I would advise him last very much due to the fact that the time privacy will not remain </li></ol>  Each of the ‚Äúways‚Äù is effective in its own way, in its own way suitable in different situations.  You can apply several methods at the same time, depending on the customer.  I think that if you had a similar ‚Äúproblem‚Äù in the form of the number of orders, then you can easily select the strategy you need from the ones I have proposed. <br><br>  Well, those who know how to supplement my note - I propose to do this in the comments.  I will be very grateful and bring them. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/27021/">https://habr.com/ru/post/27021/</a></p>
