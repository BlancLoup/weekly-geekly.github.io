      Confession: <a href="http://www.teamlab.com/ru/">TeamLab</a> users sometimes behave completely unpredictably, and we cannot always foresee their choice.  That is the conclusion we came to during the survey conducted by <i><a href="http://vk.com/wall-24713328_715">VKontakte</a></i> .  Asking the users themselves to choose the topic of the first webinar, we were very surprised to receive as the winner the answer that we expected the least. <br><br>  We didn‚Äôt want to receive as a result of ‚Äúregular_webner_annual_software_company - dreary, mechanical and inanimate‚Äù, therefore we decided that: <br><br><ul><li>  the webinar should last no more than 30-35 minutes; </li><li>  it should be held in the form of a dialogue between two presenters acting as project manager and employee; </li><li>  summarize the submitted material in the form of visual slides (standard but effective technique) </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Program selection</b> <br><br>  Basic system requirements: <br><br><ul><li>  interface intuitiveness </li><li>  minimum system requirements </li><li>  support for both Russian and English </li><li>  essential tools needed: desktop demo and chat </li></ul><br><br>  One by one we went through the services, marveling at the fact that some of them, in principle, refused to work!  During testing, the following systems were considered: <br><br>  <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/adobeconnect.html">Adobe connect</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.brighttalk.com/">Brighttalk</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.gotomeeting.com/fec/webinar">Gotowebinar</a> <br>  <a href="http://virtualroom.ru/">Mirapolis</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.onwebinar.ru/">Onwebinar</a> <br>  <a href="http://webinar.ru/">Webinar.ru</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.wiziq.com/">Wiziq</a> <br><br>  As a result, the domestic Webinar.ru system and the product of the American developers GoToWebinar turned out to be optimal for us. <br><br>  Webinar.ru turned out to be a very convenient program.  You don't need to download anything at all, and you can start working almost immediately after registration.  From the functionality - the ability to not only demonstrate the desktop, but also load presentations, videos and documents. <br><br>  We stopped our final choice on GoToWebinar based on the fact that we are planning to hold webinars for an English-speaking audience. <br><br>  <b>A few words about GoToWebinar</b> <br><br>  The interface is really very simple and straightforward.  The only negative is that there is no Russian language in the settings. <br>  After registration, you are given a free 30-day trial period, after which users make the final choice.  The cost of the program varies from $ 99 to $ 499 depending on the number of participants. <br>  Everything that you can is customized: from the type of registration email to the ‚Äúwaiting room‚Äù - what participants see at the webinar ahead of time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/386/a37/023/386a37023bbd5c6a55eba521be3a937c.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/29b/f59/bb6/29bf59bb6790b50511d7cb59ecbc83b9.png"><br><br>  The climax is, of course, the webinar itself.  On the desktop of the organizer there appears such a panel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/05e/b02/fd6/05eb02fd6cb8a7fe13b4abae587dbc82.png"><br><br>  As you can see, the main feature - desktop demonstration - the displayed windows can also be configured by setting restrictions on pop-up dies and panels. <br><br>  You can invite new participants during the webinar - just by providing a link. <br><br>  <b>Audience View</b> registers the attention of participants to the webinar materials. <br><br>  In the <b>Questions</b> section there are questions from the participants, which are visible only to you. <br><br>  <b>Chat</b> - messages intended for everyone.  We used, for example, to share links to the necessary pages. <br><br>  <b>Goal achieved</b> <br><br>  The goal was achieved - the participants showed up on time, were active, asked questions at the end and even asked for a record the next day.  Moreover, thanks to the analytics provided by GoToWebinar, it is possible to determine the level of attention of each participant individually.  (Interest Rating).  This is generally great because no one wants to be a boring speaker, and if it can be seen that the majority of webinar visitors have a low rating, it‚Äôs not possible to keep the attention and, most likely, participants listened to the conference in the background while working in other browser windows. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/21d/557/ea3/21d557ea3a2a3ed40ca33b8ca19b0df2.png"><br><br>  <b>Tips that we can give, already in fact</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Allow users to participate in choosing a topic - you can learn a lot of new things not only about them, but also about how ‚Äúintuitive‚Äù the interface of your product is. </li><li>  Polling is a great tool not only for communication, but also for raising traffic.  The activity of users with which they voted and offered us their ideas, we were very pleased.  On the days of the survey, the group scored record attendance figures, which once again confirms the fact that everyone loves to vote. </li><li>  Want to make a really useful webinar?  Look for a place that ‚Äúitches‚Äù among users most.  We looked at the most frequent questions in <a href="http://www.teamlab.com/ru/">Teamlab</a> technical support, search keywords keywords and feedback form. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>The result of our efforts</b> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/H9S_eApmRy0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiAWGt0qRTnBiobdRRvkH9blyADAg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  We would be grateful if you leave your comments in the comments as you choose the format of the first webinar, and which topics, in your opinion, should be covered in the following webinars. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/145894/">https://habr.com/ru/post/145894/</a></p>
