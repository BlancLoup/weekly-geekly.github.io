  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How does a client differ from a customer?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Sometimes it happens that the customer and the developer of the site do not understand each other.  The customer does not like the work, and the developer has to look for words to explain to the first one all the subtleties of development.  The most important thing is that both can be understood - the customer thinks that they are pumping out the bullshit, and do not fulfill his requirements, and the developer insists that it should be so. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  You can talk about this topic for a long time, so I‚Äôll move on to thoughts. <br><br><h1>  Here it is young, but here it is green </h1><br>  The site development market is young.  It makes no sense to hide it.  And the market itself, and those who deal with them.  Young people often do not know how to talk with the client, and in case of unsuccessful negotiations or delayed payment they are ready for anything (up to angry publications, threats and other shit in shoes). <br><br>  Young ambition is good, but youthful maximalism often plays a major role in negotiations with the customer. <br>  The developer forgets that he was ordered to work for his own money, and they want to get a sane result. <br>  Also, the developer forgets that the customer is a person (the one who makes the decision) or a group of people.  Not a robot, not an animal, but a man.  They have the same feelings and mistakes as other people.  Also, the developer forgets that he is not the last resort, and not a great miracle worker, but exactly the same person.  The customer is a professional in his own business (it‚Äôs better not to get involved with others), and the developer is his own.

    <h1>  I'm not a freebie, I'm a partner!  ¬© </h1><br>  The most important thing in negotiations is to make it clear to the customer that the site / video / cover, etc.  are not made for him. <br>  They are made for his clients.  And, as a rule, the opinion of the CEO or the head of the marketing department on the behavior of their own clients is very much at variance with the facts.  The developer‚Äôs problem is to understand that he must make the customer‚Äôs life better, even if the latter doesn‚Äôt like the ways. <br><br>  The CEO believes that the ‚ÄúAbout Company‚Äù link should be the first to navigate. <br>  The commercial director will not accept work if the site does not have a splash screen with the company's history. <br>  The lead marketer asks to make the site so that it fits on one screen. <br>  - Perfectly!  Wonderful!  If we make a website for you, Oleg Petrovich, or we will correspond exactly to your aesthetic perception, Avdotya Nikitishna, then here‚Äôs a check with a 15% surcharge (we will not be able to show such work in the portfolio) and we proceed, or the address of our competitors is how say so and be. <br>  But, if we make a website for your clients, then the situation changes radically.  Let us be based on our own knowledge, but not on your personal assessment like / dislike.  ‚ÄúYou should like it?‚Äù I don‚Äôt think so.  We are not doing it for you, but for people with whom you are not familiar.  Although, if you still want to sharpen the site for your idea of ‚Äã‚Äãinteractive design, then you are welcome, but it will be more expensive. <br>  And it is necessary to stipulate all this before the work begins and before the conclusion of the contract. <br><br><h1>  And now the slides </h1><br>  In this case, you can imagine that the manufacture of weapons is ordered.  And, of course, the task is posed - the weapon should kill from a distance of 500 meters, be controlled and carried by one person (here's a sniper rifle).  It is necessary that mass hysteria be - this is an atomic bomb in stock, but it needs an airplane with a pilot, and it is advisable to think in advance about the consequences.  Need to shoot on sparrows?  Sorry, we are not doing this, here‚Äôs the phone guys, they will listen to you and do everything as you wish. <br><br>  Do you want a weapon to be stunning, massive, easy to carry, and work by itself?  And also the link ‚ÄúAbout the Company‚Äù was on the handle, and in the telescopic sight did the flash roller scroll?  I realized that you saw it with another and you liked it.  Have you bought something from them?  How was the company called do not remember?  Etc. <br><br>  In general, both the customer and the developer work for the sake of the client - the end user of services. <br>  If the customer does not understand this, and the developer does not want to explain this, then nothing good will come out of the output. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/30327/">https://habr.com/ru/post/30327/</a></p>
