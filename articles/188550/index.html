In addition to a bucket of "water" about the "introduction" and "deepening" of such meetings inherent in such meetings, several moments vividly characterize the current situation with the informatization and innovative games of the government, as well as giving insight into how far people in charge of it are. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Slow and uncomfortable </h4><br>  Dmitry Medvedev, who chairs the meeting, opened the iPad and noted:

      <i><b>D. Medvedev:</b> ‚ÄúI have now opened our website for public services - such registration is difficult.</i>  <i>I looked before, and it has not changed.</i>  <i>In order to register ... Firstly, it is generally difficult for an ordinary person to figure out what is written there: download a web browser plugin and so on.</i>  <i>I know what it is, those present probably also know it, but far from everyone who is banging their fingers understand why this is necessary. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  The participants laughed pretending that they understand what the prime minister is talking about.  Then there were several speeches about the fact that simplified registration systems are being created and implemented, but again, it will not be possible to simplify greatly otherwise you can‚Äôt be sure that the citizen who identified is using the services. <br><br><h4>  How to identify </h4><br>  At the meeting, it became clear that the government still does not have a complete idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat will be the single identifier of citizens: the TIN or the SNILS.  It was here that the ‚Äúrevolutionary‚Äù proposal was made to identify citizens by the SIM card expressed by V. Zavitkov, General Director of Identity Center LLC.  The essence of his proposal is as follows: When a new SIM card is received (or an old one is exchanged for a new one), a single identification of a citizen is made, and the digital signature key is generated by the certification center, in the future a citizen can receive all services simply by entering a PIN code cards. <br><br>  <i><b>V. Zavitkov:</b> ‚ÄúIf one imagines, then the registration of a car or real estate from appealing to obtaining a result may look like pressing the buttons of a mobile phone‚Äù</i> <br><br>  The prime minister asked how to solve the problem if the SIM card for the whole family is registered for one family member <br><br>  <i><b>V. Zavitkov:</b> This can not be.</i>  <i>Sim card will be uniquely tied to a specific citizen.</i>  <i>A legislative tool for this already exists in the form of certification authorities.</i> <br><br>  Then they clarified that there would be no problems with the SIM cards of legal entities either.  In this case, the SIM card will be tied to a specific physical person - an employee of a legal entity.  There were questions from the agitated members of the prisidium: <br><br>  <i><b>A. Abramov (Chairman of the Board of Directors of EvrazHolding, LLC):</b> Is it possible to construct the identification of fingerprints on this basis?</i>  <i>We also have a screen - put a finger and ...</i> <br><br>  Magic :) But the question sounded serious.  Perhaps Mr. Abramov really thinks that any touchscreen can read a fingerprint.  He is also most likely confident that ‚Äúthe switched off mobile phone still gives a signal, take out the battery‚Äù and that the Americans were not on the moon, but oh well ... <br><br>  <i><b>V. Zavitkov:</b> Of course, it is possible, and for sure the evolutionary process is moving in this direction.</i>  <i>Today, this will be a significant limitation for mobile operators and, accordingly, it will be uncomfortable for them, so they will certainly be more comfortable with the process, which is now regulated by current legislation.</i> <br><br>  <i><b>A. Abramov:</b> In what sense?</i>  <i>This is just traffic for them.</i>  <i>They will collect more money.</i>  <i>There is more information.</i> <br><br>  <i><b>V. Zavitkov:</b> As of today, legislation does not necessarily imply that a finger is attached when forming a reinforced qualified electronic signature, therefore, it is required ...</i> <br><br>  <i><b>A. Abramov:</b> Just go from identifying a SIM card to identifying an individual.</i>  <i>All you say is the identification of the SIM card by PIN code.</i> <br><br>  <i><b>V. Zavitkov:</b> No, I'm talking about personal identification.</i> <br><br>  <i><b>A. Abramov:</b> And who enters a PIN-code?</i>  <i>This does not identify me.</i>  <i>My son can enter my PIN.</i> <br><br>  <i><b>V. Zavitkov:</b> We are talking about the fact that during the primary identification of a person he is issued an individual card with an individual PIN-code, a SIM card.</i> <br><br>  <i><b>D. Medvedev:</b> No, everything is clear, but nevertheless the question is fair.</i>  <i>PIN-codes are lost, as is known, they are stolen, in another way they fall into someone's possession, and a finger is already a more serious topic.</i>  <i><b>At the same time, our colleagues from law enforcement agencies will finally receive the ‚Äúfingers‚Äù of all citizens of the Russian Federation.</b></i> <br><br>  <i><b>V. Zavitkov:</b> If the Government supports this initiative, it will be a simple, easy solution.</i> <br><br>  <i><b>D. Medvedev:</b> Well, let's discuss this.</i>  <i>Thank you very much!</i>  <i>Since the business offers, apparently, they understand what they mean.</i> <br><br>  Well what can I say.  The method of identification is certainly good and far from new, but for some reason it seems to me that even if the government decides to implement it, it will turn into the same wild crutches as registration for ‚Äústate services‚Äù and many other state and municipal resources so disparate and disparate that in general, it is hard to believe that all this can be gathered together and made to work.  In general, it is not clear why it was necessary to create thousands of different bases of all departments, and then try to collect everything back.  Well, jokes about the "fingers" of all citizens of the Russian Federation are such "jokes." </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/188550/">https://habr.com/ru/post/188550/</a></p>
