  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Experience of restoring administrator access to the VKontakte store group</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I have the support of an online store of a local seller of mobile phones, tablets and other wearable electronics.  One morning I received a message from one of the administrators of the store group with the following content: <br><blockquote>  Hi, do you know who Alexey Kholyshev is?  At night, he threw out all our employees from the administrators and made a group of steroids from the store group.  What should we do? </blockquote><br>  Full story with all the problems and (attention, spoiler) happy ending under the cut. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Prologue.  What happened at all? </h4><br>  One night, someone entered under the account of the creator of the store group (no one knows the person with that name, most likely the fake page), deleted the administrators and changed the store theme.  Who logged in under this account is not known to me.  I only know that this account was the creator of the group and during the sale of the store to the new owners, he appointed new administrators, and he left the group.  In the morning, the managers and management were in a panic.  The group, which consisted of living active customers of the company was lost. <br><br>  With the thought ‚Äútyzh programmer‚Äù and professional curiosity, I advised to write to the support service ‚ÄúVKontakte‚Äù and describe the situation, and I‚Äôd look for precedents.  As it turned out, information about the restoration of commercial groups is very small.  Stories about information and entertainment groups are described everywhere, but not about business communities.

    <h4>  Act 1. We write in support </h4><br>  Since the group was of a clear commercial nature and referred to the existing online store, we described the situation and offered to confirm the rights to manage the site of the store by creating a special page. <br><br><h4>  Act 2. The first answer from the support </h4><br>  The first answer came the next day, but it did not cause optimism.  The agent‚Äôs response was something like this: <br><blockquote>  At the moment we have blocked the community for a change of subject and we want to hold a conversation with the creator of the group. </blockquote><br>  Pretty predictable.  We are waiting, sirs. <br><br><h4>  Act 3. Instructions for action </h4><br>  After 7 days without an agent response, we wrote a message in a ticket asking about the recovery process.  After 3 days, the agent answered us (judging by the number, another one) and sent a list of the necessary documents: <br><ul><li>  The official request issued on the letterhead of the organization.  There must be a seal, as well as the signature of an authorized person or general director.  The request should reflect the essence of the requirements. </li><li>  Power of attorney in your name indicating the powers transferred to you (also stamp + signature of the general director + date) </li><li>  Certificate of ORGN </li><li>  Trademark certificate with application (if applicable) </li><li>  Placement on any page of your site (url site) code (16-digit numeric code).  Please link to the page here. </li></ul><br>  Here we were delighted.  The documents and the link were ready for the next business day and sent to technical support. <br><br><h4>  Act 4. Waiting.  A happy ending </h4><br>  What happened on the VC side is known only to VC employees.  Almost 2 weeks passed between sending documents and restoring access.  As a result, the group was again under the control of our managers and one of them was appointed creator. <br><br><h4>  Epilogue. </h4><br>  The source of all the problems was the incompetence of SMM-managers (if they can be called that at all), who did not take away the rights of the creator of the group.  When changing business owners, personnel changes of administrators, check the relevance of current administrators and the creator of the company community in social networks. <br><br>  In fact, the group was lost for a month, but the next day after the capture was blocked and managed to publish only 1 record.  All the rest of the time she hung blocked in the list of groups of our clients.  During this period, we lost 15% of the group members (they were real customers).  The amount of lost profits is difficult to estimate. <br><br>  Now everything looks simple and consistent, but in fact it was a big stress for the whole company.  Working with a small market is very important to maintain customer loyalty.  This whole story has hit the image of the company. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290454/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290454/</a></p>
