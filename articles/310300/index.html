  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to officially accept foreign currency payments from abroad in Russia (PI)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  After my <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/moedelo/blog/53221/">comment</a> , from time to time I get the same type questions about receiving currency payments from abroad. <br><br>  Finally I decided to put all this in a post so as not to write the same thing every time.  I‚Äôll say right away that there is nothing complicated here - I myself figured it out and designed the PI in about a couple of weeks, without knowing anything about it before. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  1. We make IP </h3><br>  The easiest way is to apply through <a href="https://www.gosuslugi.ru/10058/1/">GosSlugi</a> .  <i>For IT it is most advantageous to choose the simplified tax system of 6%.</i> <br><br>  A few days later you will receive a message that you can receive documents - you will have to go for them once in person. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

        </script>
      <br>
    <h3>  2. Opening a bank account </h3><br>  After receiving documents on the opening of the IP, you can open an account in the bank.  I advise you to find a bank in which all actions can be done remotely via the Internet bank (sending / receiving documents, creating transfers, etc., etc.). <br><br>  Check at least the following: <br><br>  <strong>1. The</strong> possibility of opening a currency account (USD or EUR, depends on the currency in which you want to receive payments). <br><br>  <strong>2.</strong> Monthly payments for maintaining accounts (keep in mind that you will have 2 rubles and foreign currency; a transit account will automatically be opened to the foreign currency account - it goes to the appendage, for free). <br><br>  <strong>3.</strong> Commission for foreign economic activity. <br><br>  <i>I, with one incoming currency transfer per month and one outgoing in rubles, in the amount of approximately 4 tr.</i>  <i>per month (in my case most of the commissions are fixed, do not depend on the amounts).</i> <br><br><h3>  3. In essence, everything - you can work </h3><br>  The only thing you need is a contract with the customer.  There is no particular form, any service agreement <i>(for software development, for example) will do</i> . <br><br>  The main thing is that all payments be fixed in the contract: fixed, hourly, etc. <br><br>  Most likely, your bank will ask for a copy of the contract in Russian if the original is in a foreign language (it is quite normal to provide a hand-written translation, no assurances are required). <br><br>  <i>By the way, my contract was generally concluded before the opening of the IP - nobody, as far as I understood, does not care, until the first payment is received.</i> <br><br><h3>  4. Receive payment </h3><br>  I work on a perpetual service contract with an hourly rate.  Under the contract, every month I invoice the customer with an indication of the number of hours worked and the details of the invoice to which they must send payment. <br><br>  In the invoice it is necessary to indicate the date of the invoice, its number, the date by which payment must be made.  Here is the date of payment, it is desirable to put more.  Under Russian law, if the funds arrive later than a specified date, then you will have to pay a fine <i>(to the state).</i>  <i>I specify the month, just in case (considering that the customer transfers funds within a few days).</i> <br><br>  Upon receipt of funds, they fall into a transit account.  To get access to them, one has to go through currency control, which is given for some time (I don‚Äôt know for sure, in fact it turns out to be ~ 3 weeks, maybe it depends on the bank). <br><br><h3>  5. Currency control </h3><br>  If you have a contract of $ 50,000, you can work without a passport transaction.  When making the first payment, you need to send the contract to the bank <i>(with the transfer)</i> . <br><br>  When making each payment - send a copy of the account <i>(my bank asks for it, too, in translation - I made myself a sign in Google Docks with two pages: one - the original is in English, the second - in Russian, just the data is taken from the first page)</i> <br><br>  In addition to a copy of the account, the bank may still require a ‚Äúsupporting document‚Äù - an act of the work performed or something like that stipulated by the contract.  If the contract does not provide, then, in principle, nothing is needed.  But here it is better to communicate directly with the currency control department of your bank. <br><br>  In addition, it is necessary to make a transfer from a transit account to the main one (in fact, the above-mentioned serves precisely to confirm such a transfer). <br><br><h3>  6. Transaction Passport </h3><br>  If under one contract, regardless of the time, runs up&gt; = $ 50.000, then you need to open the transaction passport.  In my bank, this is all done through an online client. <br><br>  In fact, nothing changes, except for two things: <br><br>  - change the commission for currency control (it is necessary to watch your tariff in the bank); <br>  - currency control itself becomes more stringent: all points of the account must be accurately justified by the contract, and when passing currency control, they will now necessarily require a ‚Äúsupporting document‚Äù <i>(if it is specified in the contract)</i> . <br><br><h3>  7. Taxes, insurance payments, etc. </h3><br>  The easiest way is to use the online accounting service.  Check rates, the ability to import statements (so as not to drive in manually), and, most importantly, support currency accounts (so that you do not have to manually convert them into rubles). <br><br>  All taxes are calculated in rubles, at the exchange rate on the day the currency arrives in the transit account. <br><br>  I will not say anything more here - from the very beginning I use online accounting, it automatically calculates everything, I upload bank statements there once a month.  And when the service reports that it is time to pay taxes - I export the ready payment from it and import it into the Internet bank, I do not drive in anything manually. <br><br>  Taxes are paid quarterly, otherwise penalties will be charged.  Insurance payments are also more profitable to pay periodically - they will be deducted from taxes. <br><br><h3>  UPD.  Changes in hourly rates / terms of the contract. </h3><br>  In case you, for example, have increased the hourly rate, in order to comply with the legislation of the Russian Federation, you will need to conclude a written additional agreement to the contract, in which the new conditions will be spelled out.  It is desirable to indicate in such an agreement its number, date and, of course, what contract it is concluded with. <br>  After signing the agreement and signing by both parties, it will have to be sent to the bank when making the first payment, which came under the new conditions. <br><br><h3>  In general, this is all </h3><br>  If you have any questions - write in the comments.  Perhaps I forgot something - I will add to the post.  About typos - please write in a personal. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/310300/">https://habr.com/ru/post/310300/</a></p>
