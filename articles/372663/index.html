Let it be a bit late (the ‚Äúpolivka‚Äù has been working for me for 2.5 years). <br><br>  I do not belong to lovers of room flora, who carefully monitor the flowers, carefully wipe the leaves, etc. But I have nothing against the plants themselves.  Like that, throwing out another sdohshee plant, I thought that this is already too much.  And, since it was a dried scarlet (!), Then the search in the square. <br><br>  Looking at what is on e-bay and in stores, I decided (for various reasons) that it would be easier to make the most of the stray board with an LCD touch screen.

Assembling the power keys MOSFET on a piece of the breadboard board did not take much time either. <br>  Field radiators (IRF3205) are not needed, since the ‚ÄúOn / Off‚Äù mode does not imply greater losses, and in the open state, the resistance of these transistors is negligible. <br><br>  The body panels were cut on a home CNC machine and glued with dichloroethane. <br>  As a power supply was taken 12V power supply from an ancient and long-dead netbook. <br><br>  For direct irrigation were bought washer motors with tanks included.  Wiring to the pots - glass washer tubes with nozzles from it.  Bought the cheapest option that was found in the auto shop. <br><br>  Initially, the idea was to add soil moisture sensors, etc. But the operating experience showed that the flowers that survived were sufficiently irrigated on a schedule. There were no more victims for two and a half years, with minor exceptions, there was no (orchid died ...). <br><br>  It is necessary to add water to the tanks once every 3 weeks and once every 2-3 months to clean them from debris and other things.  It is a pity that the coolant concentrate cannot be added to the water for colors (as in the spindle cooling circuit on the CNC machine).  And that would not have had to clean the tanks from the raid and laziness would have finally won. <br><br>  Melkala thought to make an automatic gravy / water intake from the plumbing or radiator, but was rejected as too insane. <br><br>  Link to sources: <a href="https://github.com/mmMikeKn/watering_ctrl">github.com/mmMikeKn/watering_ctrl</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/372663/">https://habr.com/ru/post/372663/</a></p>
