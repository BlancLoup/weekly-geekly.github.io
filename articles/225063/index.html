Nevertheless, despite everything, I would venture to draw your attention to some truly unique tools of nanoCAD 6.0, after which the world of CAD will never be the same.  And in this article I would like to talk about the function <i>NORMAAUDIT</i> (regulatory audit). <br><br>  Those who are bored of reading a detailed text can simply watch the commercial :-) <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/2rDe4OC_I_g%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjmrnGLnqAq-F7MSAwDlvvNS7d7Fg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  We invite the rest under the cat - methodically and consistently we will consider a new function ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Introduction: a little about the essence of the problem </h4>  Obviously, when developing drawings, designers constantly refer to regulatory and technical documents (Fig. 1) - from tables, technical specifications text, stamps, callouts, ordinary text sections (standards, specifications, manufacturing rules, standards, etc.) .  Often, plots from other, older documents are copied into existing drawings. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7d4/f38/704/7d4f387048899d9a4450ba857e459afc.png"><pre><code class="css hljs">. 1.       <span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">-</span></span> ,   </code> </pre> <br>  Of course, regulatory documents are regularly updated, changed, replaced, appear in new editions, are canceled altogether ... How to quickly update documents and refer only to the latest editions of regulations and standards?  How to ensure the quality of working documentation and quickly track changes in the field of technical, technological, sanitary and other types of regulation?  Until now, there was only one way - manual: you should try to be aware of the latest events, remember your drawings and respond quickly to changes. <br><br>  But there are electronic libraries of standards and regulatory documents that are regularly updated and expanded.  Why not encourage them to help with drawing design?  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãintegrating design systems and such electronic libraries is evident.

    <h4>  NORMAAUDIT function </h4>  In fact, the task of the <i>NORMAAUDIT</i> function <i>is</i> very simple - to find in the document all references to regulatory and technical documents, check each of them for relevance and provide the user with a convenient tool for updating drawing data.  This is the task we are solving in the new version of nanoCAD 6.0! <br><br>  Let's follow this process consistently.  To do this, you can use your own drawings or open a demo from the nanoCAD software's Samples folder (select the menu item File ‚Üí Open, in the <i>nanoCAD Plus</i> section in the dialog that appears (top left) select the <i>Samples</i> folder and open the <i>nCAD</i> file <i>. Normaud.dwg</i> ) (Fig 2). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b0f/035/fba/b0f035fbad04f219fb09cff197b93eec.png"><pre> <code class="css hljs">. 2.   <span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">NORMAAUDIT</span></span>         <span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">Samples</span></span>   <span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">nanoCAD</span></span>,     <span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">DWG-</span></span></code> </pre> <br><h5>  Calling the regulatory audit function </h5>  To run the command, just type in the command line nanoCAD <i>NORMAAUDIT</i> ( <i>NORMAAUDIT</i> ) or select the menu item <i>Tools</i> ‚Üí <i>NormaCS</i> ‚Üí <i>Verification of</i> <i>references to the NTD with NormaCS</i> .  As a result, a floating panel <i>Reconciliation of references to NTD with NormaCS will appear</i> , empty by default. <br><br>  Press the <i>Find</i> button <i>on the link for normative documents</i> , and the program starts analyzing your file ... As mentioned above, any text occurrences of the drawing are searched for - in single-line / multi-line texts, tables, callouts, technical conditions, stamps, etc.  And this is unique to nanoCAD: in conventional design systems, it will be necessary to describe separate search functions for each type of text entry.  nanoCAD also provides a single interface for interacting not only with standard texts, but also with objects of specialized solutions.  Application developers under nanoCAD need only ‚Äúwrap‚Äù their objects with a special code, and the <i>NORMAAUDIT</i> function will not only be able to ‚Äúsee‚Äù the text inside these objects, but also change them (we will need this later). <br><br>  The search itself is based on the rules of regular expressions that we have already configured for users in the NormaCS software product.  Therefore, any user will get an excellent result without any additional settings.  Nevertheless, it is possible to develop your own search method and try to find more ‚Äúintricate‚Äù descriptions of regulatory documents (Fig. 3). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b95/352/338/b953523387546c8fbe62b409abcdf9cf.png"><pre> <code class="css hljs">. 3.           ,      </code> </pre> <br><h5>  Search results </h5>  As a result of the search, the NORMAAUDIT panel compiles a list of references to the regulatory technical documents used in the drawing.  Each link is drawn up as a separate line in the list and provided with an icon corresponding to the status of the document (Fig. 4).  It is very difficult to make a mistake: green links are valid documents, red ones are canceled.  In addition to these two statuses, the panel indicates four more statuses: partially valid documents, documents with undefined status, documents under development (projects), and documents requiring clarification. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d4f/c98/92e/d4fc9892e79887b8e59054fe5f7fa1f8.png"><pre> <code class="css hljs">. 4.          <span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">-</span></span> ,    ,       </code> </pre> <br>  The panel allows you to filter the resulting list by two parameters - by document status (for example, display only canceled documents) and document type (for example, display either only GOST, or only TU, or only SNiPs). <br><br><h5>  Work with search results </h5>  If you select any line in the list, two actions will occur: a) in the drawing field, the text in which the link was found will be approximated and highlighted (but this can be turned off);  b) a description of the selected document will be displayed at the bottom of the panel (Fig. 5). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d1b/b76/040/d1bb760407fc4e1b62ef89d16f204db3.png"><pre> <code class="css hljs">. 5.     ,     ,    ,       </code> </pre> <br>  At the same time, we have the opportunity not only to read the document description, but also to open it in text form and / or receive a scanned copy in the NormaCS program (commercial version), put a hyperlink to the document from the drawing, view the change history and find out which standard The inactive document has been replaced.  In the additional list you will see the document change history (previous versions of the document), where you can also get descriptive information and access to the text of the document (in the commercial version). <br><br>  And then for the sake of what all this was started: when you click the <i>Apply changes</i> button, the program corrects the text entry.  And if you click the <i>Apply to all</i> button, all references to the incorrect standard will be replaced with the current versions.  Two or three movements - and the drawing is not only verified, but also corrected! <br><br><h4>  Integration with NormaCS </h4>  Obviously, the NormaCS program is required for the full functionality of this nanoCAD function.  Let's see what versions of this program are needed - after all, for most users it is not installed. <br><br><h5>  Internet version of NormaCS </h5>  In fact, for the full operation of the NORMAAUDIT function, a small shell module and Internet access are sufficient.  The wrapper comes with nanoCAD 6.0 (both in the free and paid Plus versions), and if the NormaCS library is not found on the user's computer, the user is offered a small module ‚ÄúNormaCS Demo Client‚Äù (Fig. 6). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b7a/323/78f/b7a32378fba91d53add8fd238e8dcd63.png"><pre> <code class="css hljs">. 6.       <span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">NormaCS</span></span>,    <span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">nanoCAD</span></span>    ,        </code> </pre> <br>  This module provides a search for references to standards, and then requests the status of documents on the specialized service website NormaCS.  And if the user needs the text of the document, then this module will load the card with the latest information and details of the document. <br><br><h5>  Demo version of NormaCS </h5>  If the computer does not have access to the Internet, the user can install from the website normacs.ru a <a href="http://www.normacs.ru/demo.jsp">fresh demo version</a> , which: <br><ol><li>  contains more than 145,102 cards with the details of the documents; </li><li>  has the ability to full-text and requisite search for all documents stored in the system; </li><li>  has full-featured integration with Microsoft Office and AutoCAD products; </li><li>  includes texts and images of 200 documents from the ISO 01.110 classifier ‚ÄúDocumentation for products‚Äù; </li><li>  contains examples of construction documents (standard construction series, technological maps and OSTs); </li><li>  DWR examples of bridges </li><li>  and much more. </li></ol><br>  In addition, the demo version includes an additional database developed using the NormaCS PRO program.  This database contains GOSTs grouped by the ‚ÄúClassifier of State Standards‚Äù (CGS), as well as separately issued by ESTD, ESKD, SPKP, SIBID, GSOEI, ESKZZ, SSBT, etc. <br><br><h5>  Commercial version of NormaCS </h5>  And of course, the NORMAAUDIT function interacts with the full version of NormaCS: if the program works in your organization in a commercial mode (whether it is local or network version), then you can not just find documents, find out their status and replace outdated links with new ones, but also instantly access the text of the regulatory document! <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4>  Without a doubt, the new function NORMAAUDIT, which appeared in the sixth version of the nanoCAD CAD platform, is a significant step forward and a great helper for designers.  This functionality, unique for CAD, allows not only to quickly check the working documentation, but also to immediately correct references to outdated documents.  And complete with the commercial version of the library of standards and NormaCS standards, designers find a useful and convenient tool for obtaining high-quality working documentation. <br><br>  In the near future, this functionality will appear in all specialized solutions built on the basis of the nanoCAD platform, which means that all our users will be able to use these tools! <br><br>  Visit <a href="http://www.nanocad.ru/products/detail.php%3FID%3D606057">nanocad.ru</a> , try modern versions of the nanoCAD platform and send us your feedback!  Successful projects! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/225063/">https://habr.com/ru/post/225063/</a></p>
