This is a place for adults, guided by logic and common sense.  They do not need to take care of, do not need to follow the words, do not worry that they will form complexes.  If a person is incompetent, it is necessary to give him a clear understanding of this, and not to take care of his tender feelings to the detriment of everything else. <br><br>  So what the hell is my beautiful IT turning into a kindergarten "Fun Program Bear"? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I fundamentally disagree neither with actively implanted ideas about work ethic, nor with ideas about its consequences.  I do not like these caramel rails smeared with pink snot, to which various dreamers and populists are trying to direct the industry.  They do not lead at all to the dairy rivers with honey and but to the jungle of intrigue and the desert of personnel hunger through a tunnel of negative selection. <br><br>  What, in fact, is being postulated now as a work ethic norm?  Here is a quote from the CoC of one conference that explains this.

      We want the environment to be safe and friendly ... <br><br>  Well, like nothing bad, huh?  What is wrong? <br><br>  Everything is good.  It is right.  Problems understanding this. <br><br>  For some reason, the opinion is actively promoted that it is impossible to criticize people, it is impossible to give them a negative assessment at all.  The rationale, however, is not the results of research or at least some working hypothesis, but a stream of demagogic garbage.  The arguments at the same level as the journalism of the yellow newspapers are a juggling of facts, false conclusions and often completely outright lies. <br><br>  Why is it that security means the absence of any negative emotions?  Why does the same environmental security only spread in one direction?  It seems to me some sadomasochism.  A person can send you a review code with the same mistakes again and again and you need to respond to this with politeness and a smile?  I would definitely not call it security.  It is more likely to be ‚Äúin a state of constant stress.‚Äù <br><br>  Let programming is not a building project, but still you are not kulichiki in a sandbox lepish.  You work with real people, often with real money, some people with airplanes or tower cranes.  It is YOU who should make the environment safe, do you understand?  Do not lose someone's account, do not deprive someone of a purchased license, do not drop the plane. <br><br>  What kind of nonsense is to entrust the management of the bank's server to a young bearded man who cries from jokes about orientation?  It should be a well-established sysadmin with steel eggs, decades of experience and virtualization of professional skills in a separate left hemisphere container, where there is no access to emotions.  It is unlikely that he will grow out of a gentle hipster, who was carefully guarded from sarcasm and criticism. <br><br>  The greater the responsibility in the profession, the greater should be the resistance to stress.  A saleswoman in a store for abuse of inadequacy may cry and call the manager.  A trucker on the road should in return swipe it even harder and deliver a cargo on time with a satisfied smile. <br><br>  Friendliness of the environment, too, for some reason, is considered only in one direction.  Respect and good attitude are fairly easy to acquire and hard to lose.  You can deserve it only by treating your colleagues and your work.  Why does it suddenly show respect for a person who ignores criticism and advice?  To a person who performs his duties poorly? <br><br>  A new person in a team will always get a minimally positive attitude.  No one will insult or shun him.  Recruitment is usually guaranteed two things - that he is a smart enough person to be a programmer, and that he is polite enough to communicate in order to get through interviews.  Usually these two factors are enough for respect and friendliness. <br><br>  What, in general, should be done at work in order to FORCE colleagues to be polite?  I can not imagine this. <br><br>  Respect is probably the first (after money, of course) reason to improve your professional level.  It will not be possible to control it and even more so to demand it.  This is not how it works.  Possible maximum - the appearance of respect and ridicule behind his back.  But this is perhaps even worse than open contempt. <br><br>  Without criticism can not be improved.  Only a look from the outside will allow you to evaluate your skill.  Many things are hard to learn without mentoring.  Is it possible to convince a person to learn new things and correct mistakes without negative reinforcement?  Of course.  But its presence greatly accelerates the learning process.  Undoubtedly, it is unacceptable to insult a colleague because of a lack of knowledge, but the obvious format ‚ÄúYour code is bad, I will now explain in detail the reasons and give advice‚Äù is already considered toxic behavior. <br><br>  Avral in the work of the programmer, if not the norm, then the phenomenon is frequent and one must be ready for it.  It is impossible to catch all the bugs on the maiden, situations necessarily occur that require urgent solutions.  We must be prepared for the fact that at least the day of the year will be held in an extreme mode, perhaps it will be an extreme night, if everything is bad then an extreme week.  But where does stress resistance come from in a friendly and safe environment?  What will our kindergarten programmer do when he writes a director once every half hour and asks, ‚ÄúWell, how?  Ready? ". <br><br>  And here's another thing - people have likes and dislikes.  They may be logical or emotional - or even just a fashion for a hairstyle - but they will always be.  And closing people the opportunity to express an opinion not to get rid of them, it will all just go into the undercover struggle.  How do you like this situation - get negative feedback from colleagues for no apparent reason?  And no, you do not find out the details, you just will not get promoted time after time without knowing why.  It will not be possible to change the behavior or to improve relations in the team, because no one will say the terribly toxic truth - you have lifted up your own stories about fishing! <br><br>  Let's look around, the first shoots of this evil are already bearing fruit.  Here is a little reality given to us in sensations. <br><br>  There is an active devaluation of statuses.  Now it is very easy to find vacancies of seniors, timlids, architects with experience from the year.  FROM YEAR.  It cannot be that HR polls are crazy, someone really believes that with a year of experience you can be a top-level specialist in the profession.  Hmm ... Why then all these institutions for several years, not to mention the school? .. <br><br>  An unexpected fact - programmers do not want to work without cookies.  Are you serious?  What the hell are these fucking cookies pointing to the lord in every job?  Does your 200k salary prevent you from buying them?  Yes, you baker yourself personal can hire!  It's just some kind of surrealism.  Describe in the job interesting tasks, technology stack - yes, your working iron is, after all, many somehow forget, but cookies all indicate.  Without this, the lord will not descend.  It is clear that they are writing this to show that the candidate will work in a comfortable environment, but all the cookies of the world will not replace a normal car.  Note to all who are in search of work - the characteristics of the workplace, just in case, should be clarified. <br><br>  There are also many stories about undercover intrigues, here‚Äôs one from a person I personally know.  The developer comes to the company, works for three months, everyone is polite and courteous to him.  After three months of conversation with HR, as a result of which it turns out that the team hates him.  After that binge, go to another team and paranoia.  Although I don‚Äôt know if it is possible to call paranoia the condition when you are really surrounded by two-faced bastards. <br><br>  I would like to consider programmers a subculture.  Certainly, there are all prerequisites for this - a rather closed community of interests with its own mythology and informal leaders, with its own criteria for evaluating a person.  Do not try to eliminate all this under the false pretext of "toxicity."  What is offered in return does not even look close.  Branch of infantile double-faced amateurs?  Thank you, all I dreamed of! <br><br>  Go, you in the ass with your "toxicity"!  I say this because only friends can afford to say this to each other.  And what they are trying to push as a ‚Äúfriendly and safe environment‚Äù looks like a sect. <br><br><blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jy/sd/rr/jysdrr7tqgfjt50wtcshw89ctho.png" align="left"><h3>  Minute of care from UFO </h3><br>  This material could cause contradictory feelings, so before writing a comment, refresh something important in your memory: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">How to write a comment and survive</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  Do not write abusive comments, do not go to the person. </li><li>  Refrain from using obscene language and toxic behavior (even in a veiled form). </li><li>  To report comments that violate the rules of the site, use the "Report" button (if available) or <a href="https://habr.com/feedback/%3Ftype%3D4">a feedback form</a> . </li></ul><br>  What to do if: <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/karma/">minus karma</a> |  <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/sandbox/">blocked account</a> <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/other/">Code of authors Habra</a> and <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/other/">habraetiket</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/rules/">Full site rules</a> </div></div></blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/432700/">https://habr.com/ru/post/432700/</a></p>
