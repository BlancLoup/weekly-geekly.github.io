  <section class="page js-page"><h1>SmartProgress 2.0. We have turned goal achievement into an exciting activity.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Almost a year ago, we launched the <a href="https://smartprogress.do/">SmartProgress achievement</a> project.  It all started with an <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/smartprogress/blog/152381/">article</a> on Habr√©, which allowed us to get 7,000 unique visitors and 40,000 views on the very first day.  For us it was unexpected and unbelievable.  A lot of people wrote that they had a similar idea in their head, but it did not reach implementation.  Together with the article we got our first audience, which gave us an impetus to the further development of the project. <br><br> <a href="https://smartprogress.do/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f8c/397/da5/f8c397da5fcc2393b5dbc8d35510bcbc.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Now SmartProgress has grown into a community of 12,000 people, passionate about the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãachieving their goals.  More than 13,000 goals were created, to which about 40,000 comments and records were left.  Total SmartProgress pages viewed more than 1.5 million times.  Habr brought us 20,000 unique visitors, and they viewed the site nearly 100,000 times.  Thanks, habr, for it!  By the way, different media and blogs actively write about us, for example, <a href="http://echo.msk.ru/programs/echonet/993656-echo/">Ekho Moskvy</a> and <a href="http://lifehacker.ru/2012/10/15/smartprogress/">Layfhaker</a> .

      Together with visitor counters, the quality of targets has increased.  People have become more serious about setting goals and writing meaningful stages on their way to it.  What are the goals <a href="https://smartprogress.do/goal/10377/">? Create a network of capsule hotels</a> (in Paris) or <a href="https://smartprogress.do/goal/13405/">Make a SaaS e-learning service for the study of the exact sciences</a> or <a href="https://smartprogress.do/goal/17287/">Create a web service to effectively combat diseases</a> . <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/V8g3BxxptVo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjEg79hLEFCiTHjOzQnd39TSMJMEA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  Today we will introduce you to the innovations that have become available in the new version. </h4><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h1>  New functionality </h1><br>  <b>One of our main discoveries was templates.</b>  <a href="https://smartprogress.do/template/index/">Templates</a> are step-by-step instructions for achieving a particular goal.  Users set the template in their profile and work with it, as with a normal purpose. <br><br>  Open a business, build a house or learn to draw - all this will be offered a suitable template with a ready action plan.  The important point is the fact that the templates are written by experts who already have experience in achieving this goal, and they also lead the expert support of those users who buy this template.  Thus, installing a paid template, you will receive not only comprehensive information, but also an experienced mentor who can help with advice and give the necessary support when it is vital.  If you are not satisfied with the information received, we will refund all the money. <br><br>  Do not forget that the goals are open.  Therefore, in addition to the mentor himself, you get attention from the people who have installed the same template, and other participants of SmartProgress.  It turns out such a collective way to achieve goals side by side with people as interested in the result as you are.  Personally, we find the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãpatterns interesting and worthwhile. <br><br>  <b>Another feature introduced in the new version is the ‚ÄúWord Price‚Äù.</b>  The price of a word is a way to challenge yourself and motivate 101%. <br><br>  The bottom line is simple.  You make a public statement that you will achieve such a goal, while assigning the price of the word.  This may be, for example, 5,000 rubles.  If you reach the goal on time - the money is returned to your account, if not, then we offer options: either to transfer money to an orphanage, or to an animal welfare fund, or to develop our service.  We are adults and we must understand that no one will check the result, if you lied that you have successfully achieved your goal - it will remain on your conscience.  In the end, all this you do for yourself, not for us.  A written declaration can also be attached to the price of the word by hand. <br><br>  The price of the word really works.  Already, many have tested her power.  Now it has become an effective measure in business schools and at various trainings.  When a person has something to lose, he always acts as efficiently and quickly as possible. <br><br><h1>  New design </h1><br>  More recently, SmartProgress completely changed the design, becoming more presentable.  Usability we also took time to simplify many functions.  Particular attention was paid to beginners, who can be intimidated by the abundance of functions.  Therefore, they made a simple addition to the goal. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6b4/0c3/7d6/6b40c37d6faea8265872c6e922681759.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The new design implements many of the features requested by our users.  This is how the template, profile and adding a goal look like: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/eed/0f3/a0d/eed0f3a0d20db8e16c509fd78cec366e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h1>  Competitive moment </h1><br>  We created SmartProgress so that everyone in it would find something of their own.  So some of you may like the fact that we have implemented a game system of levels, and nonlinear.  That is, at level 5, you choose your character development scenario.  From level to level you get various bonuses.  Thus, you transfer the game mechanics to real life with one big difference - in the game you pump your virtual hero, and on SmartProgress yourself and your skills.  And this is extremely important in our opinion.  After all, sooner or later the love of games passes, and the experience of a person in real life remains with him forever. <br><br><h1>  Further development </h1><br>  We plan to continue to replenish the base with new templates and improve existing ones.  By the way, we offer to join the ranks of our experts.  To do this, please <a href="https://smartprogress.do/user/ultra">leave a request</a> or contact us by mail <a href="">hello@smartprogress.ru</a> .  We need people with extensive experience in various fields who are able to express their experience in step-by-step instructions in accessible language. <br><br>  We also plan to introduce MindMap, because this tool is closely related to the theme of our service. <br>  Now we are developing a mobile application for iOS (release 1 version is scheduled for October), then we will do the Android version. <br><br>  We have many ways to surprise you with functionality and quality. <br>  If interested - <a href="https://smartprogress.do/">join</a> . <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/194806/">https://habr.com/ru/post/194806/</a></p>
