  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Do observers affect usability testing results?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  Translation <a href="https://measuringu.com/observer-effect/">of</a> Jeff Sauro's <a href="https://measuringu.com/observer-effect/">article</a> from <a href="https://measuringu.com/">MeasuringU</a> . </p><br><p>  Many are familiar with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_effect">Hawthorne effect</a> , experiencing which people behave differently when monitored. </p><br><p>  This effect got its name when the researchers found that the workers at the Hawthorn factory did their job better not because of the improved lighting, as they thought, but because they were under observation. </p><br><p> <a href=""><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/35YrP4c0mCVkDweZnxZThHHNgd8tu9nwv89J-xSgTqKFC7eJ3E0moBs199Imb4CitWMYPFtnvBdxf9CROGRtA4fMf8iqDT5BIZOqtAxk0x-fE__VyhDWimE_vanuP2cR331WPLSz"></a> </p><br><p>  This effect works not only on humans, but also on particles.  In physics, external observation of a phenomenon (for example, the movement of subatomic particles) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_effect_(physics)">changes the result</a> . </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Observer effect </h3><br><p>  Although there are still some questions about the <a href="https://www.siop.org/tip/backissues/Jan%252004/05olson.aspx">details of the</a> Hawthorne experiment and the fact that <a href="https://www.siop.org/tip/backissues/Jan%252004/05olson.aspx">humans are not subatomic particles</a> , there is strong evidence from other sources that humans tend to behave differently from outside observation. </p><br><p>  The effect of "White coat" showed that the patient's blood pressure rises from the psychological impact when visiting a doctor (who likes to go to the doctor?).  The effect also varies with the gender of the observer and the participant in the test.  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12208639">The study showed</a> that, for example, women are physiologically susceptible to non-acceptance by society, while men are more sensitive to problems on the way to achieving goals. </p><br><p> <a href=""><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/n1IrVoyoJ3ZuNffaTPnj5oceZ9waBr1Jv15MSkanZJTqD7lEx4E24j_e6oZcYxJqdIRM5GgZe6mWIYPwEeSxL_GSvog2cqIpcwiXB3xPIQ_kq-zYEW2fyqVBvgd3qaANZ6c2amQh"></a> </p><br><p>  Interestingly, the behavior is not always consistent.  There is some evidence that when people perform simple tasks, their effectiveness tends to increase while observing them.  And vice versa: efficiency decreases when tasks are complex and less familiar. </p><br><p>  As an example, the effectiveness of experienced <a href="https://scienceaid.net/psychology/social/facilitation.html">billiards players</a> increases when they are observed, while the effectiveness of inexperienced players in this case decreases.  This effect also affects some of our favorite insects.  <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1970-00434-001">Cockroaches</a> , being under the supervision of their relatives, are able to go through a simple maze faster, but have difficulty passing difficult mazes. </p><br><p> <a href=""><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/gUT95BxQLzTgWDNR_fu1gfF9g5UoIKhnBG7Q9SpZ4765vd4Mv9SWHy55f1sufZ51T1SVTGYgVQcH5MBF5LU97LwjolsWb7JVEsV2NCiUeRiyq4KjNMb7NkdliOMkOTnCR309a4xw"></a> </p><br><h3>  The effect of the observer in usability testing </h3><br><p>  Since most of us are not particularly interested in playing billiards and conducting cockroach races, we will focus on usability testing, which is based on monitoring the behavior of its participants.  We use both observation equipment (video of the screen and the respondent‚Äôs face, sound recording) and physical observation by the moderator and often other observers located at a distance or in close proximity.  Does this observation affect the test results?  If so, how?  There are several studies that shed light on this issue. </p><br><h3>  Observation affects the level of errors </h3><br><p>  In 2005, <a href="https://hci.cs.siue.edu/NSF/Files/Pubs/UPA2005/HarrisUPA2005.pdf">Harris et al.</a>  set 100 students with simple and complex tasks in Microsoft Word.  Participants were divided into 4 groups with different conditions: </p><br><ol><li>  Group with moderator: the moderator sits behind the participant. <br></li><li>  Group without moderator: there is no moderator in the room, but the participant is aware that he is being recorded. <br></li><li>  Group with moderator + reminders: the moderator sits next to the participant and regularly reminds him that he is being watched and recorded. <br></li><li>  Moderator + design team: the participant is represented by a team of designers who watch him on the screen in a separate room. <br></li></ol><br><p>  The researchers found differences in the level of errors between these groups, but did not reveal a clear pattern.  With somewhat puzzling results, they found the group without moderator (2) and the group with moderator and reminders (3) made significantly fewer errors than the other two groups (1 and 4). </p><br><h3>  Monitoring equipment increases stress </h3><br><p>  In another study conducted by <a href="http://www.actapress.com/Abstract.aspx%3FpaperId%3D22473">Grubaugh at al.</a>  in 2005, the effects of surveillance equipment were studied.  150 university students were assigned a task in the Microsoft OneNote program.  The students were divided into 3 groups, where each group was equipped with a different set of observation equipment: </p><br><ol><li>  Strict observation: the participant is surrounded by cameras on tripods, sound recording is conducted. <br></li><li>  Classic usability laboratory: Gesell mirror (one-way mirror), inconspicuous video cameras and sound recording. <br></li><li>  Simplified laboratory: no mirrors, windows or any visible recording device. <br></li></ol><br><p>  The study showed a higher level of errors in the case of strict observation (group 1) compared with a simplified laboratory (group 3). </p><br><h3>  Observation affects heart rate and usability metrics (sometimes) </h3><br><p>  In 2009, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19851903">Sonderegger &amp; Sauer</a> set 60 respondents with tasks on mobile phone prototypes, dividing the respondents into 3 groups: </p><br><ol><li>  Moderator with two observers in the same room with the participant. <br></li><li>  One observer in the room with a participant (classic usability test). <br></li><li>  Participant in the room with the equipment for observation (without moderator and observers). <br></li></ol><br><p>  In much the same way as in the psychological experiment at the Hawthorne Factory in the 1950s, the researchers used wire devices to track the changes in the heart rate of the participants (a measure of stress).  They also determined the values ‚Äã‚Äãof several usability metrics (ease of perception, task execution, lead time, interface attractiveness and participant's emotions). </p><br><p>  They determined that the presence of two additional observers (a man and a woman) had a negative effect on the participants: </p><br><ul><li>  High stress levels (reduced heart rate variability) <br></li><li>  Low task completion rates <br></li><li>  Big time solving the problem <br></li><li>  Less positive emotional impact <br></li></ul><br><p>  Participants found no differences in perceived usability (using <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10447318.2002.9669130%3FjournalCode%3Dhihc20">PSSUQ</a> ) and interface appeal. </p><br><p>  In 2014, Uebelbacher asked 80 participants to solve simple and complex tasks in a prototype mobile application for tourists and in a real application on iPhone 3. Participants were divided into 2 groups with different conditions: </p><br><ol><li>  Without moderator and observers in the room <br></li><li>  With a moderator and two observers in the room (a man and a woman). <br></li></ol><br><p>  No differences were found in the performance of tasks, time of completion, ease of perception, and emotional performance.  However, a difference in heart rate was found.  The researchers could not reproduce the results of Sonderegger &amp; Sauer, but showed that heart rate variability is a sensitive measure of stress.  They noted: </p><br><p>  ‚ÄúWhen observers were present, there was a much stronger increase in the average heart rate from the rest stage to the completion stage of the task (+ 5.4 ppm) than when the participants worked independently.‚Äù </p><br><p> <a href=""><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Q5bLSqy-Opj-EbA9bk6PASeldztzIUfJObFzOFn2y3QSfZwl-ld8VcqoBtghummyxi2CpFINGQMoxqo_8vV2gGHWyWUPwkNv7ZueWuqm7Dre3U-JVmWNP01pnQjjl2RLPTE2RHrN"></a> </p><br><p>  Uebelbacher further noted that the observed participants reported that they were disturbed by observation, but this was less true for older participants who felt less observable than participants younger (the potential effect of age). </p><br><h3>  findings </h3><br><ol><li>  The type and number of observers are likely to have some effect on the physiology of the test participant (for example, heart rate). <br></li><li>  Since an increase in heart rate may indicate an increase in stress, it is unclear to what extent the heart rate affects usability data. <br></li><li>  Probably, participants may show high performance in some tasks and low in others, but more research is needed to confirm this effect. <br></li><li>  Additional research is required to find out how the age and gender of participants and observers soften the effect of the observer. <br></li><li>  The more visible the observation equipment is, the higher the level of participants' stress is likely, which potentially affects their performance (for example, the level of errors). <br></li><li>  When preparing a usability lab, try to minimize the visibility and intrusiveness of the surveillance equipment. <br></li><li>  The tests should include observers who do not interact directly with the participant, but observe them from another room or remotely.  In our usability tests, customers monitor participants from a single room or remotely via GoTo Meeting or stream YouTube. <br></li><li> Make sure your moderators and supervisors are not wearing white lab coats :) <br></li></ol></div>
