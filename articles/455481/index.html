  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Three stories about wild hunting</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hunting is a hiring strategy by luring a specialist working for another company.  Hunting resorted to in cases where they can not find the right specialists on the open market. <br><br>  A true headhunter is a skillful negotiator, well-versed in psychology and never pushing through.  But those, alas, are not born, but become, including, having passed through the stage of primitive hunting. <br><br>  In this article I will tell you a few real situations that happened in the practice of managers of IT companies and were associated with hunting zero level.  These are cases of the most egregious violation of the headhunter‚Äôs ethics, causing laughter from professionals and outrage from candidates, but not always understandable to beginners.  Such recruitment methods should never be used by HR managers in their work if they do not want to disgrace the employer and lose their position ...

    <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nj/qn/rj/njqnrj6k46b5gpnet_ouyjhmd1i.jpeg" alt="image"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The specifics of the headhunter profession involves the use of a wide range of means, but only if they do not violate the laws, do they not harm the reputation of the hunter himself, as well as the candidates he recruits. <br><br><h3>  Why not use personal data? </h3><br>  A small company that develops mobile applications was serviced in a large, well-known bank.  At the same time, for all the employees, the company acquired salary cards at this bank and was pleased with the cooperation.  But one day many employees of the company (holders of payroll cards) received invitations to have an interview at a given bank for a programmer position. <br><br>  The invitations came straight to work e-mail and were sent from the corporate mail to a bank employee, whose identification was not difficult.  It turned out that the young employee of the HR-department used the personal data of the bank's clients to do their work.  Thus, he not only exceeded his authority, violated professional ethics, but also transgressed the law (Federal Law 152).  At the moment, due to his fault, the bank had to pay a large fine.  Not to mention a serious blow to the reputation of a financial organization. <br><br><h3>  I saw a good specialist - recruit, do not hesitate! </h3><br>  Headhunting at professional events is another great way to find the right specialist.  But here you need to act subtly.  The head of one grocery IT company witnessed the unsuccessful recruitment of his own specialist. <br><br>  At the exhibition, where the head of the company went with his best employees, a pretty girl became interested in the stand, asked a few questions about the product, met a specialist and gave him her business card with a job offer from competitors.  And this is in front of the director of the company!  Since then, technical specialists of the company participate in exhibitions much less frequently. <br><br><h3>  Mark colleagues on a photo on facebook - help headhunter competitors! </h3><br>  Social networks are a modern recruiting method that allows you to contact a potential employee directly.  But this opportunity is not always used correctly.  So, the novice recruiter was interested in the specialists of the medical software development department of a competing company.  He managed to find one of the employees of this department on Facebook and - good luck!  - Among the personal photos was a snapshot of a corporate party, where his colleagues were noted. <br><br>  Instead of starting a dialogue with this person from afar, a pseudo-hunter sent the same text messages to all people with a photo.  Had he done otherwise, he might have had a positive result.  However, members of one team who received a patterned message were only on their guard, considering it to be either spam or provocation.  Discussing the situation among themselves, they decided that it was rather not an attempt at hunting, but a cunning check from the management.  As a result, none of them gave the answer, and the headhunter simply failed the potentially successful operation. <br><br>  These cases show the main practice of headhunting, applied incorrectly. <br><br>  Professional networking, search in social networks, enticing employees of competing companies - all this works well only with a careful and diplomatic approach to recruiting.  It is because of non-compliance with this requirement that the result was ridiculously absurd and disappointing. <br><br>  Professional recruiters know that for successful hunting you should make a lot of effort, choose the right specialist, establish friendly relations with him, the most important thing is to offer him something for which he is ready to change his employer.  A creative approach to hunting takes place, but only if it does not go beyond the boundaries of laws and ethics. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/455481/">https://habr.com/ru/post/455481/</a></p>
