Now you can use including both Flash Builder (4.0.1 and 4.5 Burrito).  However, if you are participating in the pre-release program from Adobe, it is worth noting that the latest Flash Builder drops (I6 Drop2) still cannot create the Flex Mobile Project for the BlackBerry, since I6 uses Air 2.6, and for BlackBerry only Air 2.5.  At the time of writing, the post has released a plugin that allows you to create ActionScript Mobile Project in I6 Drop2 with BlackBerry Tablet Target Platform). <br><br>  So.  You have created an application.  Next, you need to take a few steps: <a name="habracut"></a><br><ul><li>  get a key (Code Signing Keys); </li><li>  Sign up for the Vendor Portal for BlackBerry App World; </li><li>  create a certificate and sign the application with the received key; </li><li>  Lay out the application in BlackBerry App World. </li></ul><br>  And now more about each item.

      <b>1. Get the key.</b>  Follow the link: <a href="https://www.blackberry.com/SignedKeys/">https://www.blackberry.com/SignedKeys/</a> , fill in the information about yourself.  The most important thing is not to forget: <br><ul><li>  <b>Company</b> - this name will need to be specified in step 3 when you sign the application.  It will be necessary to enter completely, otherwise it will not be possible to sign the application.  This name does not appear anywhere, so if you are an individual developer, you can either have a last name, or think up a company name. </li><li>  <b>PIN</b> - again, it will be used in step 3 when you register your certificate with RIM. </li></ul><br>  Everything else on this page is quite normal.  What is the map for?  As they write at the end - to identify that you exist.  Checked, $ 1 is not removed.  The key is sent in a couple of days.  File format "client-RDK-1882355011.csj". <br><br>  <b>2. Sign up for the Vendor Portal for BlackBerry App World</b> .  After filling out the form to receive the keys, you can immediately go to <a href="">Vendor Portal</a> and register.  And there and there takes time to process.  If at the beginning of registration you select the option: ‚ÄúYes, I am going to sell applications on App World‚Äù, then at step 3 you will need to link your account to PayPal. <br><ul><li>  Step 1 - as usual; </li><li>  Step 2 - here you can specify either a company or your name in <b>Vendor name</b> .  I used VSheyanov.  This field may differ from what you entered in step 1 in the <b>Company</b> field.  Vendor name will be displayed only in App World, for example ‚Äúby Research In Motion‚Äù: <br><img src="http://blog.btbik.ru/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/BlackBerryAppWorld.png" alt="image"></li><li>  Step 3 - click on the PayPal icon, enter your data, connect.  At the time of writing, RIM canceled a $ 200 fee for registration on Vendor Portal.  Freebie, sir. </li><li>  Step 4 - we confirm and wait for a response from RIM. </li></ul><br>  Immediately after confirmation, a message will come: ‚Äúthe application has been accepted, wait.‚Äù <br><br>  The next letter will come within a week.  It will start like this: <br><br>  <b>The list has been received.</b>  <b>To complete the process, we require the following documentation:</b> <b><br><br></b>  <b>If you are a Company:</b> <b><br></b>  <b>..........................</b> <br><br>  And a form for a notary will be attached if you are an individual developer.  Praise be to <s>Allah</s> God, that RIM canceled this form, and all they need is to see the official document, which will contain the date of birth and the name / surname.  I sent a scan of the passport and, just in case, indicated where they could see the date of birth.  You can send a passport, where everything is in Latin. <br><br>  Send the document in response to a letter from RIM to the same address. <br><br>  Then it will take about another week and you will receive a letter confirming your registration.  After that, you can log in to Vendor Portal. <br><br>  <b>3. Create a certificate, sign the application.</b> <br><br>  Scheme for creating a certificate and signing the application from the BlackBerry site: <br><img src="http://docs.blackberry.com/en/developers/deliverables/23959/App_Signing_Process_Flow_1466703_11.jpg" alt="image"><br>  If it is easier, then you need to perform three basic actions: <br><ol><li>  create a certificate; </li><li>  register the certificate with RIM using the key; </li><li>  Sign the application with a certificate. </li></ol><br>  Duplicate instructions on the BlackBerry site is meaningless, so we follow the link and read how to set up and sign the application for: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://docs.blackberry.com/en/developers/deliverables/23959/Configure_app_signing_Flash_Builder_1422723_11.jsp">Adobe Flash Builder 4.5</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://docs.blackberry.com/en/developers/deliverables/23959/Configure_app_signing_FB401_1473166_11.jsp">Adobe Flash Builder 4.0.1</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://docs.blackberry.com/en/developers/deliverables/23959/Configure_app_signing_from_cmd_line_1463563_11.jsp">console</a> </li></ul><br>  It is very detailed there, and most importantly, of course, the whole process is described. <br><br>  Better I will talk about the pitfalls that have a place to be. <br><br>  When I signed the application and sent it for registration, I received a letter in a week and a half saying that the application itself was Approved, but the first release was Denied.  What is the essence: the application is suitable for the market, but there is a bug that needs to be fixed for the application to appear in App World.  There is a part in the letter: <br><br>  <b>/ ********</b> Item (s) that need attention: <br>  - Please upload a signed copy of your application, it appears that it is not signed. <br><br>  You should also have your application: <br>  - RDK.SF <br>  - RDK.EC <br>  - MANIFEST.MF <br>  - AURTHOR.SF <br>  - AUTHOR.EC <br><br>  BAR file <b>******** /</b> <br><br>  I downloaded the application signed by the instructions.  However, I did not manually add any of the listed files to the bar, which is quite natural. <br><br>  On the BlackBerry forum this question has already been asked, <a href="http://supportforums.blackberry.com/t5/Tablet-OS-SDK-for-Adobe-AIR/Please-help-me-with-signing-of-application/m-p/992891">right here</a> .  Gave advice: use SDK 0.9.4.  If nothing happens, order new keys by repeating Step 1. Alternatively, you can unpack the bar file before release as a regular archive, view its contents and make sure that these files are there. <br><br>  <b>Important!</b>  When you create a certificate in Flash Builder or from the console, and register it with RIM using the key obtained in Step 1, you will not be able to reuse this key. <br><br>  Why would you even need to register the certificate twice?  I, for example, needed to reinstall Flash Builder on another computer and the attempt to re-register the certificate to sign the application from Flash Builder was unsuccessful - an error popped up that the key was already used. <br><br>  The problem is solved by ordering a new key. <br><br>  <b>4. Lay out the app on App World</b> <br><br>  Go to the BlackBerry <a href="">Vendor Portal</a> .  Select <b>Manage Products - Add product</b> .  Fill in the required fields, upload pictures, select categories.  If the application is paid, choose licensing options.  Answers to all questions are given there.  Everything is very clearly described. <br><br>  After filling in all the fields and confirming, we are waiting for the application to be checked (maybe even tested) in RIM.  My first answer came in a week and a half.  As I said earlier, the first release was rejected because of problems with the signature.  It happens respond faster, sometimes longer.  But I would like to note that if you are silent for more than 2-3 weeks, you can start writing in RIM - <s>WTF</s> ‚Äúwhen to wait for an answer‚Äù?  In March, there was a webinar and there a representative of RIM reading the question: ‚ÄúIs it normal that the application is waiting for verification from January?‚Äù, Said: ‚ÄúOh no, send me email!‚Äù. <br><br>  Useful links: <ul><li>  <a href="http://docs.blackberry.com/en/developers/subcategories/%3FuserType%3D21%26category%3DAdobe%2BAIR%2BDevelopment%2BGuides%2Band%2BAPI%2BReference">Adobe AIR Development Guides and API Reference</a> - guides, API description; </li><li>  <a href="http://docs.blackberry.com/en/developers/subcategories/%3FuserType%3D21%26category%3DAdobe%2BAIR%2BDevelopment%2BGuides%2Band%2BAPI%2BReference">BlackBerry Tablet OS SDK for Adobe AIR</a> - step by step installation of Tablet OS SDK for Adobe Air for Windows, Mac, Linux. </li></ul><br>  I would be glad if the information is useful to you.
