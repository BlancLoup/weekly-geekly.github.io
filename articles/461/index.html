  <section class="page js-page"><h1>IT for small businesses - a separate market segment</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For a long time, small business undeservedly out of sight of IT-companies.  There are many explanations for this fact, but the most obvious is that small business is not so ‚Äútasty‚Äù in terms of profit and implementation costs. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  The first and still main sales sector is the corporate market.  Large budgets, almost constant volumes of consumption and long implementation times.  Add to this technical support, the situation for the IT company of the contractor is rosy.  Large projects in the corporate market have another nice feature - relatively low risks when a project fails.  If anyone in the subject, remember, have you seen major scandals related to the failure of the project?  As a rule, everything is quietly forgotten under the pretext of a new technology or something else.  This does not mean that the number of successful IT projects in the corporate sector is small.  It‚Äôs just that it‚Äôs not so sensitive there ‚Äî still the budget had to be mastered. <br><br>  Further attention of IT-companies attracted home users.  This is a sweet multimedia word!  Home users have given a good push to gaming technology, mass Internet access technology, and hardware and video hardware manufacturers.  Actually everything.  Won only manufacturers of hardware, gaming applications and operating systems.  Well, maybe more antiviruses.

      Small business all the time remained undeservedly forgotten.  It was believed that there can be implemented applications targeted at the corporate market.  It does not matter that the cost of these decisions can be equal to the annual turnover of a small company.  Because of this, the level of piracy in this sector of the market aspired to 100%.  Perhaps the only IT companies that successfully worked in this sector were accounting software makers.  Not the last role in this was played by our remarkable tax authorities, which change the reporting forms with enviable regularity.  ;-) And according to some rumors, they openly demanded that reporting documents be prepared in such and such programs.  As a result, they got an interesting effect: people who cannot spend a single extra penny on anything besides their main activity began to buy software and maintenance. <br><br>  In addition, it seems saturated with corporate and home users.  Software and hardware manufacturers needed a new market, but by this time it was no longer empty.  What does a person who needs a small network with a file server and a printer need for a minimal amount of money?  That's right, he hires guys who put him either pirated versions or free software.  And the latter is worse for software makers than a pirated copy.  The service business model will never bring them such profits.  As a result of the development of these trends in recent years, many software manufacturers have released specialized products and licensing schemes aimed at the small and medium business sector.  Moreover, they found that if a small business is offered a product that really helps him, then they buy it. <br><br>  About these products and the role of Internet technology in small business a little later. <br><br>  PS Not too long and tedious? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/461/">https://habr.com/ru/post/461/</a></p>
