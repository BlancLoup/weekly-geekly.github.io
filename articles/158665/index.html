Or is the ability to control a state, a city, an army, to be a significant political figure in a large, albeit virtual, world is the factor that makes you sit for days at a monitor? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/331/223/099/331223099dc572f255c67d452ce71688.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  <a href="http://mlgame.ru/%3Fstate%3Dregister_simple%26ref%3Dhabr_ru">Satisfaction of curiosity.</a> </h5><br>  I decided to find out what is interesting in these games, and also to check whether my mentality, my knowledge and education will help me to become a successful player in strategy in a short period. <br>  And you know what? <br>  My knowledge helped me. <br>  Little. <br>  Frankly, computer games I play very rarely.  I do not follow the news, I do not know which games are good and which are not.  I decided to conduct the experiment in a multiplayer browser game, where a system of paid services is developed, and there is also the possibility of withdrawing money.  The game should be exciting, understandable, so that in a couple of days I can easily figure out what's what. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ec7/be8/ca1/ec7be8ca15e532f3d81bf22632d57b98.jpg" alt="image">

    <h5>  <a href="http://mlgame.ru/%3Fstate%3Dregister_simple%26ref%3Dhabr_ru">Why games with paid services?</a> </h5><br>  Because games in which there is a possibility of withdrawing money are more close to reality from a financial and psychological point of view.  Users in such games, for the most part, are more adequate, careful, they do not take unnecessary risk.  Still, there is an opportunity to earn real money.  At least that's what the ad says. <br>  Google acted as advisor on choosing a decent game.  After reviewing the search results, I stopped at the game MyLands.  This is a realtime browser-based military-economic strategy in fantasy style.  Without thinking twice, I followed the link that was kindly provided by Google. <br><br><h5>  We set priorities or how I tried to use my knowledge. </h5><br>  Having abandoned the study of the rules of the game in half, I decided that first I needed to build buildings that produce resources. <br>  I have chosen the race of dark elves, who mine iron well, a good tree and just disgustingly gold and cereals. <br>  The builders proposed to establish one of two enterprises: a scientific complex, referred to in the game as the laboratory of the alchemists, and a sawmill, or a woodcutter's hut.  Dark elves already have a lot of wood, so I opted for the alchemists laboratory. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/447/9b3/1b6/4479b31b69d3fbf7cd42ca03cfaaef98.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  The development of trade relations. </h5><br>  No matter how hard you try, the state will not be able to fully provide itself with all the necessary resources.  For example, the special climatic conditions of the dark elf territories do not allow for the production of grain crops to fully meet their needs.  Therefore, it is necessary to import grain at not the most favorable conditions. <br>  To trade was profitable, I decided to develop the export / import of resources.  For this, I have instructed to study the relevant knowledge, to prepare qualified specialists (merchants). <br><br>  <a href="http://mlgame.ru/%3Fstate%3Dregister_simple%26ref%3Dhabr_ru">Fulfillment of social obligations.</a> <br>  Payment of pensions, benefits, the allocation of subsidies ... No, confused.  In this game, this is not necessary, but it is necessary to build housing, various municipal buildings.  Caring for citizens must be a priority, otherwise you risk facing rebellions, strikes and rising emigration. <br>  I took it into account, and did not make mistakes.  If residents needed housing, then I built them. <br><br>  Fighting unemployment.  Say "no" to parasitism! <br>  Of course, the only possible way to beat unemployment is to create jobs.  But what if all cells are occupied, there is absolutely no territory for the construction of new enterprises? <br>  In the game, workers do not always fulfill their duties.  I learned that the button in the upper right corner will help fill all the buildings with workers.  It is a pity that in reality there is no such effective button. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a70/daf/3c2/a70daf3c2fa896f474596fae88cfb510.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It soon turned out that the strategy was more military than economic.  But I did not lose heart and continued to play and develop further. <br><br><h6>  Getting rid of the dominant of raw materials or ‚ÄúTo hell with housekeeping!  It's time to rob and kill! ‚Äù </h6><br>  In the future, my state will not be limited to the extraction of resources.  Defense and active combat is what I should have paid attention to. <br>  The emphasis in MyLands is still not on the economy, but on the fighting.  The development of the city, skillful housekeeping is important only at the beginning of the game.  Performing combat missions, looting other people's castles, capturing slaves, mastering salt lakes and ruins - that‚Äôs what really brings a lot of resources. <br>  It is possible to create alliances, join clans, carry out joint multi-step operations to seize foreign possessions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/af4/bc7/923/af4bc792366fb0af6be9f178e6bb103d.png" alt="image"><habracut><br><br>
<h5>  Search for motivation.  Ability to show their abilities. </h5><br>  Do you want to be in the shoes of a strategist, diplomat, cunning manipulator, puppeteer and schemer?  Yes please.  This game provides such an opportunity.  Just try not to engage in vile things in real life. <br>  In MyLands there is a place for betrayal and noble deeds.  Once a friend may suddenly become an enemy.  The enemy will become a friend if you have common goals. <br>  Simply put, MyLands is the world of the Middle Ages, ruthless, barbarous, where there is no place for such phrases as effective organization management, etc. <br><br><h6>  Goal setting. </h6><br>  My knowledge did not really help me.  The development was very slow.  Cardinal measures were needed. <br>  A truly wise ruler should always have a long-term development plan for his state.  In the game I set the following goals: <br>  1. To develop the city to level 5.  To do this, it was necessary to gradually expand the boundaries of the city, perform non-combat missions, effectively allocate resources, competently conduct trade relations, build the necessary buildings. <br>  2. Open the gates of the city.  The main advantage of opening the gate is the ability to participate in combat missions.  To open the gate, you must study the knowledge of the "Gate" in the list of sciences. <br>  3. Build settlements outside the city limits. <br>  4. Participate in combat missions. <br>  5. Build new cities and villages. <br>  6. Stable to develop their state, expand ownership. <br>  7. Explore new territories, look for Salt lakes and Ruins of level 7, where Black Pearl deposits are stored <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e67/545/220/e67545220643bb2612afdcdd2a8e77e1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  Real people are real emotions. </h5><br>  At first, the game does not cause delight.  The city is developing slowly, you have to wait for several hours.  However, then the pace of the game accelerates, and in just a few days you and your allies will discuss a plan for attacking a lonely vacant city. <br>  Most of all in the game I like the opportunity to play as a team.  A certain cohesion appears in players of one clan.  Not always in real life, people are so worried about their loved ones, as in this game.  Perhaps this is wrong.  But one thing I can say: this game will appeal even to those who have never played games. <br>  Just imagine how you manage a large polis, send troops to conquer neighboring territories, spend competent tactical moves, perform combat missions as a team.  Imagine how your possessions grow and grow. <br><br><h6>  <a href="http://mlgame.ru/%3Fstate%3Dregister_simple%26ref%3Dhabr_ru">Not tired?</a> </h6><br>  Oh yeah, I didn‚Äôt tell if I became a professional MMOG player, did I understand what exactly was keeping gamers at the monitors. <br>  To a professional player, I'm definitely far away.  But I realized that these boring, slow strategies are actually very interesting. <br>  The most important thing in multiplayer games is team spirit.  Plus the ability to show ability and, possibly, raise self-esteem. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8f7/2a8/897/8f72a8897512fbd51eada744b16669c1.png" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  I have never tried it - so try it! </h5><br>  If you liked the article, then next time I will talk in detail about my difficult formation in this game, I will give some tips on how to go.  But for this you need to be at least a little topic. <br>  Before the game, I did not read any reviews.  Evaluated the game yourself.  And that was the right decision. <br>  The controversial picture is born in uninitiated minds, heard hundreds of opinions, read dozens of reviews.  A lot of words said about the game.  But only chaos and false beliefs give rise to these speeches.  Either the game is criticized, or admired.  No other is given. <br>  But what do we do?  Choose one of the points of view and calm down? <br>  Or still try to play and make your own opinion? <br>  <a href="http://mlgame.ru/%3Fstate%3Dregister_simple%26ref%3Dhabr_ru">Decide only us with you.</a> </habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/158665/">https://habr.com/ru/post/158665/</a></p>
