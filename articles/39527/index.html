      Once, when I was sorting out my young man's sports bag, I found him with some kind of notebook, all written with strange notes and scribbles like ‚ÄúPress 120x5x4x3x2x1‚Äù, ‚ÄúRest more - tired!‚Äù  Then still hieroglyphs, these records caused my interest, and I decided to ask what their mystical meaning is. <br><br>  He explained that those who train seriously keep training diaries in order to plan their progress in ‚Äútraining weights‚Äù and ‚Äúincreasing lean muscle mass‚Äù. <br><br>  Ta-da-da-da ... Angel Light was poured from heaven, and we immediately understood what people were missing.  By the way, this idea was also already implemented by English-speaking startups, and besides gyminee we came across a number of interesting projects. <br>  Having studied the question in more detail, we decided on this topic and stop. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It took some time to choose the name: almost all the options that we liked and contained the words ala body, bodybuilding, etc.  were busy. <br>  Then we turned to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãour project: to create a network for those who are in love with sports, so that they effectively train and communicate to improve their bodies.  Here is the name: body-network and the slogan for the development of ‚Äúbuild your network to improve your body‚Äù or easier, but in Russian ‚ÄúTogether is stronger‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Development</b> <br>  As I mentioned above, the development took us 8 months. <br>  Idea idea, but everyone wanted to eat.  Therefore, we had to work on cold winter evenings with a <s>kerosene</s> desk lamp in complete ignorance from when to approach. <br>  Lack of money helped us to invent ingenious ways to convince freelancers to draw us 32 psd pages for 150 USD.  and in general - experiment;). <br><br>  As it turned out, it was better to save money and do everything yourself.  This, as it turned out, applies to layout. <br>  As a result, we had to partially refine both the design and layout. <br><br>  The development process had a ‚Äúenriching‚Äù effect on our minds, so that in parallel we mastered a number of new (for us) technologies: AJAX, Flex, learned to draw in Photoshop, make videos in Adobe Premiere, etc. <br><br>  <b>At the exit</b> <br>  At the output, we have a 99% completed project, which we will initially launch in the CIS, and after finalizing the errors, we will translate into other languages. <br><br>  In addition to standard social functions such as Friends, Groups, Blogs, etc., Body-network.ru helps users: <br><br><ol><li>  track your training progress </li><li>  form and coordinate a nutrition plan </li><li>  create and share training tips </li><li>  view themed video, etc. </li></ol><br>  We are now announcing the start of the testing phase.  We ask you to help us with this case and <a href="http://body-network.ru/try.html">get an invitation to participate in testing.</a> <br><br>  We thought that it would be necessary to somehow encourage your help to us, so everyone who takes part in testing will participate in the raffle of valuable prizes. <br>  And not in a random order, but for your activity: the number of errors found, the best wish, etc. <br><br>  We are waiting for feedback from you and <b>invite you to test</b> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/39527/">https://habr.com/ru/post/39527/</a></p>
