Sunno A880</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A few months ago on Habr√© was a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/gadgets/83212/">review of the</a> Chinese clone HTC <br><br>  Touch Diamond 2 from habrauzera <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/riffkazan/" class="user_link">RiffKazan</a> . <br>  I read, I was impressed, I chose the ordered.  Sunno A880 is an analogue of HTC Magic, but more than twice cheaper. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/645/e2a/dbc/645e2adbc39f2af97e696a3e174f4bfa.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Long away. <br><br><h4>  In face and profile </h4><br>  He, like the original, attracted me first of all with his appearance.  And the content, judging by the description, was on the level, but more on that later.  The phone looked good on the site, so I was looking forward to its delivery and was preparing for the worst - I took the cat in the bag.  But I was pleasantly surprised to see him.  Pure glossy white plastic front and back panels, nice lines, completely repeating the form of the original. <br>  Gloss even on the inside: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c59/80c/62d/c5980c62d9d22e8ce00df69984e68c05.jpg"></a>

      <br>
      The case is solid, it does not creak (unlike, for example, the Nokia N82, on which you can even play a melody), there is no backlash.  Here are just one detail confused: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ff5/2c3/fe9/ff52c3fe9f6160bc8dd5a5b1e2440716.jpg"></a> <br><br>  At first this seam was evident, but soon I got used to it and did not notice it anymore. <br>  The back cover is thin and a bit scary for its seeming fragility.  But in fact, a couple of falls have already experienced: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/513/5f8/b00/5135f8b00433e1688f4b86771d9e34b9.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Screen 3.2 "with a resolution of 320x480 (One of the main selection criteria - I like to read in transport and not only). Large, comfortable, no grain is visible, but the number of colors - the problem of Windows Mobile - affects gradients. Besides the screen on the front panel, the speaker , microphone, call and end buttons, and nedotrekbol. What caused this disability is difficult for me to understand, but instead of a full trackball, as on the original, here is a button that does not have a special functional load. The bottom is clean. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/217/4fd/6c3/2174fd6c34f5e541e5bbfd16ab216b5d.jpg"></a> <br><br>  At the top end there is a switch on / off the display / phone and a hole for the string. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/edc/d73/614/edcd736145923f7ab36fea25d93773e0.jpg"></a> <br><br>  On the left is a connector for connecting to a computer or a charger, a hardware customizable button (GPS) and a frightening Reset button, rendered for something almost main (it‚Äôs not necessary to use yet). <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7d9/f44/c7d/7d9f44c7db5338e96eefa306ba6509a4.jpg"></a> <br><br>  On the right is the volume control, the second customizable button (camera) and 3.5 headphone jack (the second important selection criterion) <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e60/b43/fd1/e60b43fd161184932a522ccda82ec6c1.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Back: speaker, camera, flash, logo. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ade/aa0/804/adeaa08047b5ccedfd9ea9f0d07e8f35.jpg"></a> <br><br>  As you can see in the photo, the Chinese have problems with ... I do not know what, but the camera lens and flash are installed far from the center of the holes for them. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9d4/29c/836/9d429c836831325656634feb68042099.jpg"></a> <br><br>  In general, the appearance of the impression pleasant.  The gloss of plastic is a little soiled, but it is almost invisible because of the white color.  There are no complaints about the quality either, although I only use it for about a month.  Only from the headphones near the connector appeared wiped: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e75/588/fdb/e75588fdb5ea99ef8ad3829447d8eec8.jpg"></a> <br><br><h5>  As for the filling </h5><br><h6>  GSM </h6><br>  It works in all four ranges (other models supported mainly three).  But the level of reception is much lower than on other phones.  Sometimes, where Nokia took with two or three divisions, there is no connection to Sunno at all.  But there are practically no problems with coverage in the city, so the moment is uncritical. <br>  A much more unpleasant problem with incoming calls.  Periodically, the phone does not respond to them.  On the other side, you can hear beeps, dialing, and nothing on the phone.  Similarly, with SMS - does not reach.  Until I dial from him to any number myself, the device does not wake up.  It happens not so often, because I talk a lot, and since the phone is not the main one, you can put up with it. <br>  There is a problem with SMS: it is not possible to send new SMS, but the responses normally leave.  What is the problem, I have not figured it out yet.  Makes either the radio module (hardware or firmware) or WM6.5 itself <br><br><h6>  GPRS, EDGE </h6><br>  In stock, it works.  The used and available network are reflected in the status at the same time. <br><br><h6>  GPS </h6><br>  For a long time, I doubted that he even existed.  None of the navigation programs found satellites.  But it turned out again that the signal from the satellites is very weak.  In fact, even when satellites were detected for more than 15-20 seconds, the connection was rarely kept. <br>  In his topic RiffKazan described a similar problem.  But more about that later. <br><br><h6>  Camera </h6><br>  It would be better to omit this item altogether.  In China, they do not know how to make cameras either as an independent product, much less as part of a telephone. <br>  Photos are grainy, dark, with incomprehensible dots over the entire area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe picture.  The outbreak is very weak and little sense from it. <br><br><h6>  MRZ and sound </h6><br>  After the first power-up, I was just terrified: inarticulate rattling sounds came from the speaker.  In part, it was such a melody.  But the speaker is really disgusting and listening to it without harm to your ears can only be quiet and calm music.  In general, the built-in speaker was very disappointing.  But the sound that goes to 3.5 output is quite good.  In any case, I did not notice a significant difference between the sound in Suuno and the Sony player. <br><br><h6>  Memory card </h6><br>  Microsd  There is no hot eject - you need to pull out the battery.  Although it is strange for a modern device, all the more so when you connect a cable to a computer, the flash drive is still unmounted. <br><br><h6>  Battery </h6><br>  This is another reason why I bought a new phone.  On the old Nokia E60, the charge lasted for 3-4 hours. <br>  With 10-15 minutes of calls a day, music, vain attempts to connect with satellites and the Internet after several battery workouts, the charge lasts for 2 full days and for part of the third. <br><br>  There are a number of claims to WM6.5, but this does not fit into the framework of the topic. <br><br><h5>  Autopsy </h5><br>  In the first days the phone was dissected.  My expectations to see there are several scattered chips holding on the glue, as I heard before, did not materialize.  Inside pretty well everything. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/288/3f8/c6f/2883f8c6f85cd00ea1c29bb520e6c989.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/71f/14a/e47/71f14ae4743e5d2348311112c3c12ce1.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6bd/ccb/952/6bdccb952d734c7261edda69b20bf061.jpg"></a> <br><br>  This is certainly not Nokia, <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1f1/544/a39/1f1544a399a3689ccd7f9bd6322b92e5.jpg"></a> <br><br>  but build quality respect is. <br><br>  To be honest, I do not understand anything in electronics, I disassembled in order to see if there are any visible reasons for a weak GSM and GPS signal.  So it was in the case of RiffKazan.  It was enough for him to bend the missing contact so that the GPS could work normally. <br><br>  In my case, two antennas are visible at the bottom.  Presumably these are GSM / GPRS and Bluetooth antennas (small). <br>  Compare the Sunno antenna module: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0e8/0f8/f7e/0e80f8f7eef2d3a0fc81ee878791e8ff.jpg"></a> <br><br>  And Nokia: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/40c/285/c5c/40c285c5c74f63e3c1320ba4def8a544.jpg"></a> <br><br>  And in the upper part there is some kind of parallelepiped connected to the board.  At first I thought it was a vibrator, but the mount connector looked like an antenna connector, presumably GPS.  It did not occur to me to test the purpose of this block at once, and now I am in dark ignorance. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4d2/b58/fca/4d2b58fca5618ce741f0726040ca41f0.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/045/c94/255/045c942555f148463fead0dad058a424.jpg"></a> <br><br><h5>  Kit </h5><br>  There were two batteries in the kit, but there was no spare battery charger.  And every time to turn off the phone to charge the battery is not very convenient. <br>  There was also a stylus (it was needed only for the WM6.5 keyboard, which is just disgusting, but after installing the Finger Keyboard it is not needed at all), the network adapter, the car adapter and the USB cable to xs. <br>  It would be better to put two cables in the kit (home / work / car), because if this one breaks, it is not known where to look for it later. <br>  In fact, perhaps, I just did not see such a connector.  Who knows, tell me: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d4d/53e/61e/d4d53e61e73b3580dfc5b510e4901056.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Summary </h5><br>  Conclusions do you.  It is difficult to say, a hundred device works out 6000 ru cost: a lot of jambs and no 3G.  But for myself I can say that I am quite pleased with it.  Perhaps this is due to the fact that the phone itself is only a third of the functionality of this device that I need.  But in order to call, I have a good old T610. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/826/570/912/82657091205ca2f09c83b899ff08daf4.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/df5/a6e/dc0/df5a6edc0f7592f0b4a3377a3fb6156c.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Do not ask me how he came to such an appearance - it is a long but interesting story.  Let me just say that after flying from the third floor, he recovered the speaker and microphone, because of which he actually went to the shelf for several years, giving way to the Nokia E60. <br><br>  The impression of owning a phone is also good because the store‚Äôs support is a very nice girl, Marcia.  After the delivery of the order, I communicated with her a lot on Skype.  Very patient and nice girl.  She treated my problems with understanding and tried her best to help: she even found a thematic German forum and contacts of Russian phone owners.  A person, evident from the conversation, cares about the name of the company in which he works.  In addition, when drafting an order, I indicated that it was better to pack it, having read the Russian mail on the Internet, asked to install support for the Russian language of the interface and select certain body colors.  Everything is done exactly.  I received a package with a box (safe and sound).  On the box there was a terrible low-quality print, and it was wrapped in scotch: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c56/f90/487/c56f90487eef70de3293dc67bac5bad1.jpg"></a> <br><br>  In the box, the phone is packed in a cloud of packages with balloons: <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e63/ee7/9c7/e63ee79c7c1eedb087d8399e4987c5c2.jpg"></a> <br><br>  In general, the order went about one and a half months, but I think that this is a problem of customs, and not mail, because the MSK package flew to me in 3-4 days.  And in general, I personally have no complaints about them. <br>  This phone is on the site: <a href="http://allymobile.com/x_sunno-sunno-a880-gps-wifi-5-0mp-camera_1839.php%3Fk_id%3D0%26kn%3D">http://allymobile.com/x_sunno-sunno-a880-gps-wifi-5-0mp-camera_1839.php?k_id=0&amp;kn=</a> <br><br>  Well, the bonus: a five-minute funny video about this phone: <a href="http://www.clonedinchina.com/2009/11/video-sunno-a880-huawei-k3-based-windows-mobile-phone.html">http://www.clonedinchina.com/2009/11/video-sunno-a880-huawei-k3-based-windows-mobile-phone.html</a> / I apologize, I did not find how to insert it here. <br><br>  PS I thought to do in the review without detailed technical specifications.  But no - they ask. <br>  In fact, everything is fully consistent with the description on the site: <br>  OS: WM6.5 <br>  CPU: HiSilicon K3 460MHz <br>  RAM / ROM: 128/256 <br>  Wi-Fi, EDGE (GPRS), GPS (Well, you already understood) <br>  GSM 850/900/1800/1900 <br>  Camera <br>  MicroSD memory cards <br>  3.5mm headphone output. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/93853/">https://habr.com/ru/post/93853/</a></p>
