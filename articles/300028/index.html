      As part of these projects, we have compiled a list of analytical comments on the situation in these market segments - and we want to talk about them. <br><br>  <b>Let's start with the situation on the contextual advertising segment:</b> <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The contextual advertising segment in RuNet shows growth (by the end of 2015) even in times of crisis.  At the same time, a number of significant recent changes in the market (for example, updating the Yandex.Direct auction algorithms, changing the policy for working with Yandex agencies, etc.) introduces a certain amount of uncertainty. <br><br>  It should also be noted that the term ‚Äúcontextual advertising‚Äù itself is gradually eroding.  With the growing popularity of tools for narrow targeting of the target audience (including behavioral factors and remarketing tools), the very concept of ‚Äúcontextual search query‚Äù is gradually becoming a thing of the past.  The possibility of reaching the audience through partner networks with advanced settings for matching requests / interests (and a similar movement towards social networking tools) suggests that very soon the concept of ‚Äúcontextual advertising‚Äù will no longer describe a particular market segment, but will become only a special case / channel in general performance mix. <br><br>  These changes occur very quickly and cause a certain chaos both in the terminology of the infrastructure of the digital market, and in the positioning of agencies, and, of course, in the mind of the final customer. <br><br>  <b>Now a few words about the mobile development market</b> <br><br>  <i>The mobile development market is rapidly moving to the regions (and to the West)</i> <br><br>  One of the most important trends in the development of the mobile market in 2015-2016 is the concentration of a significant part of the leaders in the regions of the Russian Federation.  Of the first ten of our rating, only 4 companies have head offices in Moscow (another 4 developers come from St. Petersburg, one each from Voronezh and Rostov-on-Don). <br><br>  This is not only due to cost reduction and the deployment of regional production offices by large agencies. <br><br>  After the fall of the ruble exchange rate, services and hourly rates of Russian developers have become much more attractive to customers from abroad.  Therefore, many companies in the mobile segment are oriented toward working with them (it is easier to sell, higher margins, more market capacity).  And for a foreign customer in 99% of cases there is no difference whether his contractor is located in Moscow or some other Russian city - the work is still being built remotely.  This format is fundamentally different from the standard approach of working with a large Russian client, requiring full-time presence in the capital. <br><br>  <i>Growing pains</i> <br><br>  Runet‚Äôs mobile development market is growing too fast.  What took the web development segment 20 years, the mobile segment ‚Äúslipped‚Äù in 3-4 years.  This creates a number of difficulties.  Agencies often face a number of managerial problems associated with scaling up a business, understanding its place in the market, and its own positioning.  Therefore, it is often possible to observe ‚Äúeasy chaos‚Äù, when during the first half of the year, former leaders may lose their positions, and recent newcomers may soar to the top. <br><br>  Unfortunately, these problems affect the average quality of services provided to the end customer.  Even when contacting the same company at different periods of time, the client can get a very heterogeneous quality of work at the output. <br><br>  <i>Full-cycle agencies vs small productions</i> <br><br>  Largely because of such a rapid growth of the market, the production departments of large full-cycle digital agencies are increasingly losing in terms of quality and price of work to ‚Äúclean‚Äù developers.  Therefore, in contrast to the web development segment, in a mobile, large agencies are increasingly rejecting their own production in favor of outsourcing services to compact and fast local teams. <br><br>  <b>And finally - about the market for the development of Internet projects.</b> <br><br>  2015 and the beginning of 2016 were a very difficult period for the Russian custom web development market.  The following factors determine the situation in the segment in 2015-2016: <br><br><ul><li>  Most industry experts agree that the web development segment is stagnating or showing extremely insignificant growth in 2015 in gross shipments of services.  The crisis and the increase in the level of competition exerts significant pressure on the market.  A number of first and second echelon companies faced significant financial problems and were forced to significantly reduce staff.  In the period of 2015-106, there is an active redistribution of budgets and client lists between agencies (and between various client sectors).  About 10,000 web studios are still operating in the segment, the annual rotation / turnover reaches 30%. <br><br></li><li>  The process of transferring production units to the regions has become even more active than before.  Due to this, large agencies achieve cost reduction, as well as get access to fresh personnel, being able to offer more comfortable working conditions than regional agencies. <br><br></li><li>  A large number of web studios are trying to customize sales and production processes for Western clients.  For obvious reasons, the attractiveness of working with a Russian contractor for Western clients has increased significantly in recent years, on the one hand, and on the other, hourly rates in dollars allow agencies to work with much higher margins.  At the same time, there are still significantly less successful cases of staging such interaction in the web development segment than in the neighboring mobile development segment. <br><br></li><li>  In the past two years, there has been a significant increase in the share of projects and services provided for the e-commerce industry and public sector projects. <br><br></li><li>  In a crisis and aggravated competition, one of the key advantages of web studios is the possibility of providing quality support services and the development of Internet projects, traditionally being the weak point of the Russian market. <br><br></li><li>  The trend that we talked about over the past few years is having an increasing impact on the market.  In a crisis and with the active growth of cloud services, more and more customers from the low price segment prefer self-development of simple websites on simple designers.  This puts significant pressure on the low-cost segment of small web studios.  On the other hand, a number of companies (including first-tier players) began to include customization services and "refinement" of sites on popular designers in the common pool of their own services. <br><br></li><li>  Under current conditions and much sharper than in previous years, competition with the agency‚Äôs own marketing becomes one of the key factors for running a successful business. </li></ul><br>  On this we have everything, stay on the line =) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300028/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300028/</a></p>
