  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Lost your Android communicator? Be ready!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello habrazhiteli. <br>  Losing a phone is always an unpleasant event.  But in the current situation, when almost all online services are tied to the smartphone itself and to the SIM card number, the loss of the phone turns into a real headache. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Input data: </h5><br>  During the rest at one of the ski resorts of our vast country, the phone quietly fell out of the inside pocket and most likely was picked up by more successful travelers, because within five minutes it turned out to be turned off, which would not have happened if it had just dug into the snow. <br><ul><li>  On the phone itself, applications of almost all social services were installed: logins, passwords and turnout. </li><li>  A google card was attached to the Google account. </li><li>  To the number were attached Google account, social.  networks, payment systems. </li></ul><br>  The attempt to block the SIM card in place turned out to be unsuccessful - my opsos phone was not at hand, and no one remembers the ‚Äúglobal number‚Äù by heart.  Moreover, later two and a half hours attempts to call the operator in order to block Simka were not crowned with success.  And for online number blocking, you must have a phone with a number that needs to be blocked. <br><br><h5>  Obvious problems </h5><br>  Problems with blocking (diarrhea rays to my operator) numbers are fraught with consequences in the form of both debts on a SIM card account and new passwords on services with phone binding.  One social network that is too popular in Russia does not allow you to delete a phone number without providing a new one.  In case of delay with blocking, you may be in debt only because the opsox decided to save on the call center.

      Personal data from the phone on the android user can not be deleted remotely.  As well as any of the installed programs.  All personal and business correspondence is suddenly not so personal and business. <br><br>  A separate huge beam is sent to the Google company for the fact that there is no clear possibility to untie the phone from an existing account, without having this phone in hand.  In volume, the beam is tripled if, as in my case, bank cards and payment system applications are attached to the account. <br><br>  If you take the worst case scenario, then I risked losing access to my Google account with the phone, the debt on the operator‚Äôs account and a lot of money from the credit card.  Not counting the data leakage from Evernote. <br><br>  The new owner would like to wish the rays of good if he immediately reset the phone to the factory settings and the rays of diarrhea, if he decided to delve into the installed software. <br><br><h5>  PS </h5><br>  If any of the android developers want to write an application that, when changing the SIM card and entering the wrong password, resets the phone to factory settings or resets the boot loader, I will be happy to help with the development of the interface and will definitely buy this application in the market. <br><br>  <b>Upd:</b> <a href="https://market.android.com/details%3Fid%3Dcom.androidlost">An application</a> that allows you to delete data after the loss of the phone. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/133544/">https://habr.com/ru/post/133544/</a></p>
