  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About Kingmax Hercules DDR3 2200 overclocker memory and overclocker variants</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Habrales do not need to tell about what overclocking is and why it is needed.  Those who are fond of this activity are for some reason called overclocking or overclocking, but overclockers.  However, the guys do not take offense.  But the trouble is: there are two types of overclockers, one of which is found mainly in the fantasies of marketers, and the other lives in real life.  According to marketers, an overclocker is a person who is obsessed with speed for the sake of speed and is ready to pay at least a dollar for each additional megahertz.  Such people buy in kilograms everything on which there are huge radiators, water-cooling systems and thick copper pipes, and in general they are so severe that instead of ice they add liquid nitrogen to whiskey. <br><br>  The same overclockers that I myself have watched are usually interested in buying budget solutions and bringing them to top-of-the-state with minimal effort.  They are not more interested in thick-thick tubes, but in more prosaic things: unlocking additional cores in processors, increasing the frequency of the chip and memory of a video card, including streaming processors in the GPU (although this fun has been practically unavailable recently).  That is, the task is not to spend more and spread your fingers in front of their own kind, but, on the contrary, to save.  Who is right, marketers or I, decide for yourself.  And in this post I want to talk a little about memory, which, on the one hand, fully corresponds to the fantasies of marketers, and on the other - is relatively acceptable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e15/e69/dc1/e15e69dc118e96bcb186f8a6042a9dc4.jpg" alt="Kingmax hercules"><a name="habracut"></a>

      This is a set of Kingmax Hercules DDR3 2200. Two strips included in it are capable of operating at a real frequency up to 1100 MHz, which gives an effective frequency equal to an impressive 2200 MHz.  Lot?  Yes, not the word.  I still can not forget how impressed the Pentium III-600 processor was, and the memory is already storming the frequencies, much more severe.  It just doesn't fit my mind, as Sasha Gray once said after filming a scene with Rocco Siffredi. <br><br>  Kingmax Hercules is delivered in a big shiny box (as you know, overclockers from marketer‚Äôs dreams are simply crazy about boxes, and the more they are, the better).  On the inside cover, you can read a brief version of the legend of Hercules (Hercules is Hercules) in two languages, and it emphasizes that this glorious warrior was distinguished by extreme decency and achieved everything without cheating.  Between us, this is not entirely true, because Hercules and women drenched for the sake of a corbel, and he stole cows and apples.  Well, let's hope that among potential buyers of a set of bore, like me, a little. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/864/df4/914/864df4914306422b4c7f955ab3a36f8a.jpg" alt="Kingmax hercules"><br><br>  Radiators in memory - my respect.  Not only are tall, almost doubling the height of the module, so also the cooling fins at the top are arranged in three rows.  Considering that the radiator is pressed very tightly to the chips, plus they did not save on the heat-conducting gasket, there should be no problems with the heat sink.  Just do not be surprised that the teeth on the photo go out of tune: the radiator is not solid. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/002/d89/386/002d89386a62f8654ede50f19b732d11.jpg" alt="Kingmax hercules"><br><br>  The chips under the radiator are neatly marked as KINGMAX KFB8FFJXF-DXX-09Z.  Of course, I would be happy to believe that Kingmax learned how to make chips on its own, but, as we all know, this is not true.  A search on the Internet has shown that this is actually Elpida BBSE.  However, by and large, it does not matter - just to work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/409/502/de2/409502de29114f45236986f21d1f957f.jpg" alt="Kingmax hercules"><br><br>  Fortunately, it works here.  An important advantage of this kit is that it safely starts up without manual overvoltage in the BIOS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8c0/eb2/ae5/8c0eb2ae5e8b5a97673f99c3f5b18489.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  It seems a trifle, but you would know how many modules Corsair and OCZ rent to stores with the motivation ‚Äúmarriage does not work‚Äù simply because the buyer was too lazy to carefully read the attached papers.  On the other hand, and who said that he should do it at all?  Overclocker - yes, and in timings it cuts, and in the voltage, and CAS differs from RAS.  And those who are tempted by a beautiful box and huge radiators are also, in general, people.  And Kingmax treats them (and sellers) quite humanely. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7d2/2cd/e35/7d22cde358011bbb45e2c7ffda7f5bbd.gif" alt="Kingmax hercules"><br><br>  So, by work.  On the 1333 MHz memory frequency native to my motherboard, Kingmax Hercules works just amazingly with 6-7-6-18-88-1T timings.  This, as we understand, is much better than those registered in SPD 9-9-9-24-74-1T, so even those who have bought this memory for beauty just can't get into the BIOS just once.  I overclocked to 1600 MHz without much difficulty, just throwing off the timings for the passport for 1333, but then it became sad ... No, it's not a memory, it‚Äôs just good. <br><br>  It's just that my Intel DX58SO motherboard has already turned a year and a half, and when it came out, the maximum memory frequency on it was limited to 1066 MHz.  Yes, like this.  Then a new BIOS came out, ‚Äúresolving‚Äù a more acceptable 133 MHz, but this already seems to be almost the limit.  The relatively low frequency is compensated by the support of the three-channel mode of operation, and therefore I am not in a hurry to upgrade.  At the same time, I have been going to assemble a test bench for P55 or H55 for a long time, in order to avoid such confusions with megapamy from now on ... <br>  On the Internet, I found several reviews of Kingmax Hercules (this <a href="http://www.overclockers.ru/lab/36418/Izuchenie_razgonnogo_potenciala_Kingmax_Hercules.html">one is</a> not bad), and in all I achieved the memory of the promised frequency.  True, she didn‚Äôt give much further, but, on the other hand, is there any sense for further acceleration?  After all, whatever one may say, but from time immemorial to this day the only important characteristic of RAM is its volume.  And overclocking for overclocking ... Well, I do not know.  Not mine. <br><br>  And about very important - about the prices.  When the Kingmax Hercules set went on sale (it was in March), it cost, terribly to say, $ 330-350.  Now the price has fallen to quite reasonable $ 220-230.  Also, of course, not cheap.  But the same amount, for example, costs a 4-gigabyte Corsair Dominator GT package with a maximum declared frequency of 1600 MHz. <br><br>  Of course, there are still lots of offers of 4-gigabyte fast memory sets with beautiful radiators in the region of $ 130-160, but we must understand that in this case we are talking about the extra charge for the radiator, while the chips inside are the most common.  Therefore, if you are a moderate overclocker or just a normal person :), it makes sense to buy the most that simple memory with a passport frequency of 1333 MHz and try to tweak it a bit.  In this case, you should not worry about radiators, because at a voltage of 1.45-1.5 V the heating of the chips is minimal.  The ‚Äúsimple memory‚Äù of DDR3 in pedigree modules of 2 gigabytes is now sold for about $ 60-65 per thing (i.e., $ 120-130 per pair). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/344/f97/7dd/344f977dd5c615e4fc229b1a969d92f2.jpg" alt="Kingmax hercules"><br><br>  But the funny thing is that removing Kingmax Hercules and replacing them with your own, also very worthy Aeneon X-Tune, is just a passion, as I did not want to.  Painfully beautiful radiators :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/98176/">https://habr.com/ru/post/98176/</a></p>
