  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Corporate history in pictures</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello!  The background of this topic is as follows.  Once I wondered how I would look at how a site looked 5-10 years ago?  My searches led me <a href="http://archive.org/">here</a> .  This is an ‚ÄúInternet archive‚Äù, paradoxically as it sounds.  It has the service The Wayback Machine, which gives you the opportunity to see how the page looked in the past, say 2-3 years ago.  And I was very interested.  I decided to see how the sites of various well-known companies and corporations now looked like, compare what it was and what it became.  Well, so that it was not boring, dilute the viewing of the topic with some interesting piece of reading related to these companies. <br><br><h4>  "Evil Corporation" </h4><br>  Microsoft sample October 1997. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/c5cb7e5e/a2822f2e/8f6b2f2d/b199cbe6.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This time is also called the browser battle, in the period from 1995 to 1997, Microsoft fought Netscape for the browser market.  But by the end of 1997, Microsoft won this battle thanks to the ability to embed Internet Explorer into Windows.  What immediately took advantage of the US Department of Justice, which opened the lawsuit against Microsoft.  The government accused Microsoft of using a monopoly on Windows to limit consumers to products from other companies.  And Bill Gates had to testify under the video camera.  Microsoft was convicted, and even the serious question was about the division of the corporation into several companies, but this did not happen. <br><br>  Our days <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/b6e832dc/5b9bee4b/b66cb3ad/4d66f8c0.jpg">

    <h4>  "Corporation of Good" </h4><br>  Google 1998, December. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/b37654d9/ea5dda34/85361740/8172b6aa.jpg"><br><br>  Have you ever wondered what Google means?  In general, as Wikipedia says, this is a game with the word googol.  The term meant the number ten to the hundredth degree.  But I think very few people know that initially the search server was called BackRub.  Larry Page and Sergey Brin students at Stanford University worked on this server.  Soon they showed their brainchild to their teacher, and launched Google on the site of Stanford University, and the network almost collapsed.  And the creators were expelled from the hostel where the first Google computers actually stood).  Some people call Google a ‚Äúgood corporation‚Äù, perhaps because the company's motto sounds like ‚ÄúDon't be evil‚Äù.  Google was looking for investors for a long time, and found a few.  One of those who could see the genius of the Google search engine was Andy Bechtolshaym, one of the founders of Sun Microsystems.  The check for 100 thousand bucks was written for Google Inc.  Although then the company was not officially registered and they did not have their personal account.  It is interesting that very few Excite companies could buy Google for a million bucks, but they did not.  And now Google is worth billions. <br><br>  And today as in the 90s) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/39971642/57d9eaed/79d4d89f/5578bc5e.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Yahoooooo! ... </h4><br>  Yahoo 1996 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/9d2d793a/9a11b12d/677a38a5/20c8a483.jpg"><br><br>  At the very beginning everything was very modest.  Jerry Yang wrote scientific work and spent a lot of time on the Internet looking for a variety of information.  At that time, if you started the browser, you saw a large amount of text and links to other pages, you moved from page to page and thus looked for everything you need.  I think it is not necessary to tell that the process of such a search could take just a huge amount of time.  Therefore, Jerry came up with the idea to catalog pages by the type of information that was placed on them.  So the site was created, which was called ..., no, not Yahooo.  It was called "Jerry and Faylo's guide to the world wide web."  But soon the name was changed to Yahoo!  There are three versions of why exactly Yahoo.  The first, on which the developers insist, the word was taken from Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels book.  The second version says that Yahoo is an acronym derived from the phrase ‚ÄúAnother hierarchical uncouth (unofficial) soothsayer‚Äù (Yet Yet Hierarchical Officious Oracle).  And third, yahoo from the Japanese "yahhoo", which means "hello".  The funny thing is that at that time Yahoo was already a registered trademark of barbecue sauce, so an exclamation mark was added to the name. <br><br>  Our days. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/3975f62d/b0d3fe0d/7cc0e6c7/a9ea5599.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Boob tube </h4><br>  Tele 2005 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/363090bd/f8179259/c8f80ea9/a1889f87.jpg"><br><br>  The project was founded by three former PayPal employees in 2005.  What gave a large number of users the opportunity to broadcast to all the Internet with their videos.  And so the first video on youtube was flooded on April 23, 2005, and in an 18-second narration he told about elephants in the San Diego Zoo park, and you can watch it <a href="http://youtu.be/jNQXAC9IVRw">here.</a>  The service quickly gained popularity, and in the summer of 2006 received its first claim for distributing the video without the knowledge of the author.  Universal Tube and Rollerform Equipment Corp.  (sellers of pipes) also filed a lawsuit against the television pipe, although it was not related to copyright.  Just their website <a href="http://www.utube.com/">www.utube.com was</a> often unavailable due to the huge number of visitors who made mistakes when typing the domain name of the service.  And they demanded that YouTube either change the domain name or pay for hosting the utube.com website.  "Representatives of Universal Tube claim that YouTube is undermining the activities of pipe vendors due to the fact that potential customers of the company have difficulty working with the website utube.com (due to excessive attention to this Internet page, the online representation of pipe vendors was significantly hampered ).  In addition, Universal Tube emphasizes that the site utube.com is 10 years older than YouTube. ‚Äù( <a href="http://domenforum.net/showthread.php%3Ft%3D11148">Link to the news</a> ) That's it. <br><br>  Telecom 2011 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/a6b85885/03e10206/36bf1404/0c2a419a.jpg"><br><br><h4>  An Apple </h4>  Apple 1997 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/4301ae58/512eed80/9332ae01/7cfc96ec.jpg"><br><br>  About this company, many and many know.  So I didn‚Äôt really want to write something here.  So I‚Äôll just give the technical specifications of the Apple I assembled in the garage of Steve Jobs.  The case for the Apple I was knocked out of a wooden box, the RAM was 4 KB, and the processor was the MOS 6502, it was an 8-bit microprocessor with a clock frequency of 1 MHz.  And it cost Apple i 500 bucks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/127b2094/8e509300/c3b99333/ac9c3a30.jpg"><br><br>  Well, perhaps that's all.  And this is a small bonus for those who watched and read to the end. <br><br><h4>  <b>UFO</b> </h4>  So you looked October 15, 2006) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/12e1de7d/56b25de5/a6467864/e79b78d5.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/134137/">https://habr.com/ru/post/134137/</a></p>
