Gardner </h2><br><p></p><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/29d/9ee/8f1/29d9ee8f152c4a55886af512715edbf7.jpg"></div><br><p></p><br><p>  The book by Heidi Gardner, Ph.D. and lecturer at Harvard Law School, on how companies best ensure customer loyalty, attract highly qualified professionals and gain a competitive advantage.

In Russian, the book has not yet been published. <br></p><br><p>  ‚Üí <a href="http://a.co/aAu4ICq" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a> <br></p><br><h2>  2. "Spark: How to Lead Yourself and Others to Greater Success" ("Flash: how to lead yourself and others to success") by Angie Morgan and others </h2><br><p></p><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/28a/bc2/991/28abc299198a4a7da772652931d27ea4.jpg"></div><br><p></p><br><p>  Despite the fact that the book was released in early January, it has already become a bestseller according to the New York Times. <br></p><br><p>  In their book, leading entrepreneurs, business consultants and war veterans talk about the fact that everyone can become an outstanding leader if he uses the seven key rules of behavior. <br></p><br><p>  Due to the up-to-date information and interesting presentation, the book will help to reconsider your leadership qualities and reveal the potential of a real leader in you.  In the book, the authors also share a large list of Internet resources that will help maintain and develop leadership qualities after reading it.  In Russian, the book has not yet been published. <br></p><br><p>  ‚Üí <a href="http://a.co/9rr30AW" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a> <br></p><br><h2>  3. "Tao of Charlie Munger" ("Tao Charlie Munger") by David Clark (David Clark) </h2><br><p></p><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/74d/398/c0a/74d398c0a1d04dc18218c7d6d97bec17.jpg"></div><br><p></p><br><p>  Surely many of you have heard about the books from the ‚ÄúBuffetology‚Äù series, the most popular of which is ‚ÄúTao Warren Buffet‚Äù - quotes and thoughts of the richest person on earth. <br></p><br><p>  And about who Charlie Munger is here, few people know.  Although he is also one of the richest people in the world, a very influential investor and vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway. <br></p><br><p>  That's because Manger is very often in the shadow of the glory of his business partner, Warren Buffet.  As Warren Buffet once said, ‚ÄúOur company, Berkshire Hathaway, was built according to Charlie‚Äôs plan, I was just the general contractor there.‚Äù <br></p><br><p>  The book ‚ÄúTao Charlie Manger‚Äù was published in English on January 3, 2017 and has already become one of the hottest releases of this year according to Amazon.  David Clark, co-author of the book, gathered in it words of wisdom, comments and advice for all occasions from one of the most influential investors in the world. <br></p><br><p>  Unfortunately, we still do not have information about whether our publishers will buy the rights to the book and whether it will be released in Russian.  Previous books from the Buffetology series have been published by Popurri. <br></p><br><p>  ‚Üí <a href="http://a.co/5THB5Jh" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a> <br></p><br><h2>  4. "The Fourth Industrial Revolution" ("The Fourth Industrial Revolution") by Klaus Schwab (Klaus Schwab) </h2><br><p></p><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cf0/3f1/fe5/cf03f1fe514246d1b214162c4a9dd71a.jpg"></div><br><p></p><br><p>  The world-famous economist Klaus Schwab, the founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, talks about how we have the opportunity to go through the fourth industrial revolution, which will radically change the way we live our lives. <br></p><br><p>  Schwab argues that the fourth revolution will differ in scale and complexity of the changes being introduced from all previous ones. <br></p><br><p>  Artificial intelligence has already penetrated into all areas of our life, what's next?  Nanomaterials are 200 times stronger than steel and thinner than human hair;  liver transplant surgery done on a 3D printer;  "Smart plants", which work alone robots;  mobile phones implanted in humans and made from bio-synthetic materials.  All this is not the plot of novels of science fiction writers, but awaits us in the near future. <br></p><br><p>  Schwab offers bold predictions about how to use the changes of the fourth industrial revolution and shape a better future in which technology helps people, not replace them. <br></p><br><p>  The book was published in Russian in 2016 under the title ‚ÄúThe Fourth Industrial Revolution‚Äù. <br></p><br><p>  ‚Üí <a href="http://a.co/2VwXGIH" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a> (English version) <br>  ‚Üí <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/138439958/" rel="nofollow">Ozon</a> (Russian version) <br></p><br><h2>  5. ‚ÄúA Man for All Markets: From Las Vegas to Wall Street, How I Beat the Dealer and the Market‚Äù (‚ÄúMan for all markets: how I conquered the casino and market from Las Vegas to Wall Street‚Äù) by Edward Thorp (Edward O. Thorp) with preface by Nassim Nicholas Taleb </h2><br><p></p><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/32c/bc4/920/32cbc492082f44468cda271dec6d4305.jpg"></div><br><p></p><br><p>  The book was published just the day before yesterday, January 24th.  It is noteworthy that even before its publication, she already claimed the title of the super bestseller of 2017, and Nassim Nicholas Taleb himself wrote the preface to the book (‚ÄúBlack Swan‚Äù, ‚ÄúAnti-Fragility‚Äù). <br></p><br><p>  This is an incredibly true story of the famous mathematician Edward Thorp, who revolutionized the casinos of the world and on Wall Street. <br></p><br><p>  Edward Thorp is considered the inventor of the counting card, which allows you to play a safe game of blackjack against the casino.  His method was so simple and effective that it caused a storm of indignation among the casino owners.  After the invention of the method of counting cards, casinos changed the rules of the game in their establishments, and Thorpe became persona non grata in all gaming establishments around the world. <br></p><br><p> After his casino owners discovered his method, Thorpe decided to revolutionize Wall Street by introducing mathematical formulas that allowed him to play a win-win game on the stock exchange. <br></p><br><p>  In his book, Thorp, for the first time, reveals all the cards in front of his reader and tells about all the motives of his actions, curiosity, which always moved them and helped him to look from a different angle on what seemed to be insoluble problems. <br></p><br><p>  In Russian, the book has not yet been published. <br></p><br><p>  ‚Üí <a href="http://a.co/dWgDLpq" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a> <br></p><br><h2>  About Us </h2><br><p>  We talk about the key ideas from the best books of the genre of non-fiction.
