  <section class="page js-page"><h1>On the transfer of domains.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  To transfer domains from one registrar to another, it was necessary to send a paper (well, or how - real? Physical?) Letter with a request to change the registry field.  Moreover, my signature was to be notarized. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Waking up earlier (which equates to severe violence against the body), I went to the nearest office to confirm that it was I who was going to do this dirty business. <br><br>  First, the notary tried for a long time to penetrate into the text of the letter, clearly not understanding what I am planning.  Then, seeing the list of domains, he stated literally that he could not read what was written and, therefore, not certify the signature, since the document should not violate current legislation, and quite possibly, I indicated there information discrediting the honor and dignity of individuals and organizations. <br>  He demanded to make an official (even indicated the company where I can go) translation of the names into Russian!

      Having mentioned the notary's mother, he went to the bus stop (it was not close to go), got into the minibus, which, having just left the bus stop, got into a small accident.  Having mentioned the driver‚Äôs mother, he decided to walk. <br><br>  When he reached the translators, he explained to them the essence of what was required of them, he laughed with them and received the necessary list with a stamp and signature. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/589/f90/824/589f90824ae058b0d0b19a02f49b49cf.jpg" width="450" height="422" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  I didn‚Äôt want to go back, and there was another notary in the same building at random.  Which, without explaining the reasons, refused to assure my squiggle.  I had to go to a stop. <br><br>  But in the first shelter of the bureaucracy I was delighted even more: now I needed to bring an interpreter to them with a pen (through the floor of the city) to confirm his own signature! <br><br>  "- I used to be angry, but now I‚Äôll start killing." <br><br>  Colleagues came to the rescue, advising a fully sane office, where the whole business took no more than ten minutes even though the signatures in the passport and the letter were different (in the banks I had persistent problems because of this). <br><br>  Now the envelope has already been sent by the first class, carrying in itself, in addition to a sheet with a long-suffering seal, my negative emotions and references (no more material than the previous ones) to the registrar's mother. <br><br>  Thought at last. <br>  It always seemed that the network was free from bureaucratic delays and paperwork.  Do I ever have to buy a regular domain, I have to carry a certificate from the hospital, a copy of the certificate and seal the contract with a bloody print? <br><br>  <a href="http://creadome.livejournal.com/6148.html">creadome.livejournal.com/6148.html</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/25784/">https://habr.com/ru/post/25784/</a></p>
