  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Most Popular Books on Reddit Programming</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There is an opinion that programmers do not read books.  Learn by example or instruction.  Others buy, but do not read.  But on the Reddit blogs, books are quoted in their comments, which means they can be trusted a little.  Certainly more than Amazone or Ozone reviews.  When choosing a book to read, it is important to know the most popular manuals on professional growth.  Someone important to find the most famous books, someone wants to weed out the "pop".  The Reddit website discusses everything from pets to the newest weapons.  The Reddit Favorites project <a href="https://redditfavorites.com/books/programming/">analyzed</a> 3.5 billion comments and identified the 24 most-mentioned books on programming. <br><br>  The most cited on Reddit tutorial is ‚ÄúClean Code‚Äù by Robert C. Martin.  Unlike many other books, this edition has steadily increased the popularity of readers since 2010. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first ten lines of the rating are the following books: <br><br><ol><li>  ‚ÄúClean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship,‚Äù by <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD,_%25D0%25A0%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2582/">Robert Cecil Martin</a> . <br>  In Russian, the name of the book ‚ÄúClean Code.

      There is one AI application book in the list - ‚ÄúArtificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach‚Äù.  There are no other specialized books on programming fashion trends: neural networks, blockchains or robotics.  All application examples in cases inside books. <br><br>  In the comments to the books, programmers, in addition to compliments to the authors, quickly move from discussing books to discussing the merits of programming languages.  This is probably normal, but it shows that everything depends on who is at what level and on what code. <br><br>  All lists of recommended books are subjective and even based on the statistics of references Reddit too.  If you are in doubt what to read, compare, for example, <a href="https://medium.com/%40YogevSitton/the-ultimate-reading-list-for-developers-e96c832d9687">with this list</a> and select the books that are present here and there.  24 books are mentioned in the Reddit list, and the link is 139. There is something to choose. <br><br>  A great supporter of reading books is <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8,_%25D0%2594%25D0%25B6%25D0%25BE%25D1%258D%25D0%25BB">Joel Spolsky</a> , the author of the popular online magazine <a href="http://joelonsoftware.com/">JoelOnSoftware</a> and the even more popular Q &amp; A programming questionnaire <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> , visited by 118 million programmers every month.  So there are no books written by Joel `Spolsky in the Reddit rating.  You can evaluate the magazine or the <a href="https://ru.stackoverflow.com/">Russian version of</a> its Q &amp; A questionnaire, although it is much inferior to the original. <br><br>  And by the way, he also has <a href="https://fossbytes.com/10-most-popular-programming-books-on-stackoverflow/">his own list of the</a> best books.  The intersections are full.  Although the places are changing. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/343870/">https://habr.com/ru/post/343870/</a></p>
