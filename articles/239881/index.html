According to a <a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/larger-apple-ipad-to-be-delayed-1412846867">WSJ</a> informed source, this is due to large orders for new iPhones. <br><br>  According to an industry spokesperson, Apple vendors initially planned to begin full-scale production of large tablets in December of this year. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  According to the WSJ, Apple‚Äôs supply chain, in an effort to meet demand, is now focusing on producing large screens for the company's smartphones.  ‚ÄúThe release volume of the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus remains unsatisfactory,‚Äù a source told.  ‚ÄúIt would be a real problem if display manufacturers decided to reallocate resources and spend several months increasing the output of screens for new, larger iPads.‚Äù

      Foxconn, Apple‚Äôs main smartphone and tablet assembler, also had difficulty trying to hire the necessary number of workers to build new iPhones at the company's largest enterprise in Zhengzhou in southern China.  Only in this factory, more than 200 thousand people are busy assembling the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, as well as manufacturing some components for Apple smartphones (in particular, metal body parts are made here). <br><br>  ‚ÄúEveryone is busy with new iPhones - this is bread and butter for Foxconn.  Terry Guo himself (president of the company) went to the Zhengzhou plant to control production, ‚Äùa Foxconn representative told WSJ. <br><br>  Apple claims that over the first weekend more than 10 million new smartphones were sold - on September 19, sales started in 10 countries.  Later, the company expanded this list.  It is expected that sales in China will begin on October 17th.  Updating sales statistics will be announced during Apple's quarterly report (October 20). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9df/413/fcb/9df413fcb05e4e209e1260f692769352.jpg"><br>  <i>What will it be, iPad with a diagonal of 12.9 ""?</i>  <i>According to MacRumors - some such (on the left - a large iPad, on the right - the usual one, below - an iPad mini) ...</i> <i><br></i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7f4/f69/b44/7f4f69b446ed4093818fc21664728dd3.jpg"><br>  <i>... or can be compared with a 13-inch MacBook Air</i> <i><br></i> <br>  According to information from some Apple vendors, the new tablets are likely to have a 12.9-inch screen with the same resolution as the 9.7-inch iPad Air (2048x1536) sold since last October. <br><br>  Apple recently announced another press conference to be held on October 16.  The invitation does not say what will be discussed at the event, but it is expected that the company will present its new iPad and iMac.  It remains unclear whether Apple will disclose plans associated with large iPads - company representatives declined to comment. <br><br>  Apple's plans for the release of tablets with an increased diagonal, apparently, are associated with a decline in sales of other iPad models.  Sales of these devices have been falling for two quarters in a row, while sales revenue has fallen over four of the last five quarters. <br><br>  Suppliers are also preparing for the mass release of 12-inch MacBook Air, scheduled for December - according to information from sources familiar with the situation, the new laptops will have a higher resolution (today the company releases the MacBook Air with diagonals 11 and 13 inches). <br><br>  ‚ÄúIf Apple is going to launch large iPads, [companies] should think about making better use of the big screen,‚Äù said Tim Coulling, an analyst at Canalys.  ‚ÄúEnhanced multi-tasking capabilities will certainly attract interest.‚Äù <br><br>  <b>PS</b> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DNUp8xJHPfDk">Video review of new iPhones</a> can be found on our YouTube channel. <br><br>  <b>PPS</b> If you would like to collaborate with our blog or create video content for <a href="http://bit.ly/GTF_YouTube">the Geek to the Future channel</a> , write to the author or to the mail geek-to-the-future (ya.ru). <br><br>  <b>PPPS</b> Original WSJ article can be found <a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/larger-apple-ipad-to-be-delayed-1412846867">here</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/239881/">https://habr.com/ru/post/239881/</a></p>
