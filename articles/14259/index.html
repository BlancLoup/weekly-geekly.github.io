      <strong>Negative aspects of working in a company:</strong> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The manual is very tough.  They even kicked five minutes late.  Pay a little.  In practice, do not make out.  Disastrous work schedule (change 12 hours of continuous work at the computer).  A technical support engineer has to bear constant moral responsibility to the users for the lack of coexistence of other departments.  Allegedly, official employment - in practice, it turns out that the employee is not drawn up, the employer has no obligations to him.  Having worked for a month and a half, I received back a clean work booklet, while there was pressure and an attempt to make it work out a two-week period, despite the inconsistency of this action of the Labor Code of the Russian Federation.  It also turned out that zp  hourly, and not agreed on the development of the rate of shifts (16 per month) after which it was stated that in order to obtain a complete zp  it is necessary to work out the number of hours that nowhere figured.  That is, it is really necessary to work out not 15, but 18 shifts in order to receive the agreed amount.  After all this, according to the results of calculation, for the spent month I was paid 6,000 rubles.  instead of the stipulated 12, which was argued by my unwillingness to work further and deducting from Z. p.  premiums for the reporting period.  That is, in fact, zp  constructively curtailed when trying to quit.  Arguments of the management are the most diverse: indication of the Labor Code, pressure on the human factor, if this does not help, then the highest measure is used - operating on the fact that the employment has not been formalized.  Although the part of the employee is all done and made the form of formal employment.  The office is clearly designed for the resigned non-resident, of which the constructive majority works in it.  It creates a constant illusion of a friendly team and social security, which has no support.  In fact, workers are exploited, promising brilliant career growth.  In running positions terrible turnover of personnel, which is actively used by the leadership.  Very strong bureaucratic apparatus, which, in fact, allows in any case to be legally clean.  Now for the little things: the leadership is tough, although it constantly tries to emphasize a friendly attitude - in principle, a normal state of affairs.  The food is disgusting.  Despite the emphasis on training in the process of work, no one is going to teach you anything, career growth is also very dubious - there is a great chance to just quit.  So, summing up: a provincial-oriented corporation, clearly worked out the resignation of workers, forcing them to work in harsh conditions at a ridiculous salary level, trying to cut back on what they pay to the minimum at the right opportunity. <br><br>  Mda ... you customers are not afraid to trust such tortured people?  :) <br><br>  Related link <a href="http://www.seonotes.ru/2007/09/13/8-printsipov-naemnogo-rabotnika.html">What you need to know so that the employer does not ‚Äúupset‚Äù you,</a> just look through to the end, there are interesting comments. <br><br>  ps it is not zakazuha, as it may seem, I have some projects at this hoster itself, but I thought about it. <br><br>  <a href="http://cybo.ru/">Web 2.0 news, Web services, Social networks, Mashup, AJAX, Tags</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/14259/">https://habr.com/ru/post/14259/</a></p>
