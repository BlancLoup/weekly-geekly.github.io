In 1989, it was put into service, and in 1996 it was put on combat duty. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/63a/2b6/6b8/63a2b66b8b2220268dc7e69cd5d78d9e.jpeg"><br><br>  The control system of all these facilities is built on the basis of the domestic <a title="Wikipedia" href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AD%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580%25D1%2583%25D1%2581_(%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BF%25D1%258C%25D1%258E%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580)">Elbrus-2</a> microprocessor; <a title="Wikipedia" href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AD%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580%25D1%2583%25D1%2581-90%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE">Elbrus-90 micros</a> are used as workstations for control terminals directly by the radar station (allegedly).

Go ahead. <br><br>  Command Post Radar Don-2N: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/555/054/873/5550548731e4d21e0806e70bb05764ef.jpg"><a title="Photo author" href="http://d-a-ck9.livejournal.com/48690.htmls"></a><br><br>  Oh, what is it? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/19e/16d/fa6/19e16dfa6edc3da645d652b11ef0d78f.jpg"><a title="Photo author" href="http://d-a-ck9.livejournal.com/48690.htmls"></a><br><br>  Total Commander .. ??? <br><br>  It seemed?  We wipe our eyes with the help of other bloggers: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/05b/3a1/b96/05b3a1b969921595e19951db3f39b5e0.jpg"><a title="Photo author" href="http://antares-610.livejournal.com/"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/227/1ed/f42/2271edf426ef7538acee46cc8dc31857.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/706/b99/645/706b99645edbe8aa0bcd5ea4bcc0408e.jpeg"><br><br>  Judging by the hologram sealed monitor, the computer has passed a special inspection and is <b>officially allowed to</b> process state secrets, there should be only certified programs (otherwise, what's the point in certification of iron).  Total Commander has no certificates, which, in principle, is understandable.  The abundance of icons on the taskbar and desktop 7-ki leads to bad thoughts about the abundance of trash installed on the machine. <br><br>  It seems that it was from her that a beautiful picture was displayed on the main KP screen: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c97/96e/39c/c9796e39cb40f98f5690548d99ba4515.jpg"><br><br>  I would like to hope that this was really only a demonstration for bloggers, and in combat mode it looks something like this, and really works under the control of OS MSVS: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e1e/6c0/0ef/e1e6c00ef95c0979af7fb353a0cd809c.jpg"><br><br>  In any case, even if this computer is not tied directly to the control of the radar, secret information circulates on it, because  He is certified for this, but no one watches what the soldiers put there.  Judging by the photos and videos from KP, it is very likely that Windows-based machines are used to render beautiful three-dimensional images, which means that all the secret information about the situation flows to them. <br><br>  The problem is that at this stage of development of our army, its <a href="http://military-press.livejournal.com/402911.html">total computerization</a> takes place, and the officers responsible for ensuring secrecy, as a rule, are mature people who generally have difficulty understanding what a computer is.  For them, the main thing is that the corresponding certificates and other paperwork are drawn up on these boxes, the cases are sealed, the program fate of the hardware does not bother them at all.  At the same time, young soldiers, working on these machines, drag them into anything, install their software, connect their disks and devices.  With the introduction of information technology, a breach in the army is reaching a new level, when even an innocent attempt by a person on duty to play Angry Birds on a service computer can derail all national security.  At the same time, our presidents loudly swear at the US Department of State and search for spies. <br><br>  Everyone well remembers the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/infosecurity/105964/">story of the Stuxnet virus</a> , which was able to disable the Iranian uranium processing plant.  For this, he did not need remote access to the system, internet connection, or even administrative privileges on the machine.  One single connection of the infected flash drive to the factory computer was enough ... <br><br>  Another <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/infosecurity/130015/">story</a> , when the control system of American drones was infected, again with the help of removable drives and all kinds of storage for them.  And this is happening in the country, with a high culture of information security, because  such technologies have been used there for decades! <br><br>  I am not paranoid and do not think that a backdoor is built into every CIA program.  I know very well how they treat the secret service in our valiant army, but one thing is some kind of General Staff kilometers that no one needs for a long time, and completely different information on the command line of the key link PRO ... !!! <br>  We are waiting for your Stuxnet, gentlemen generals ??? <br><br><h6>  PS </h6><br>  It will be interesting to see in the comments other photos / videos with a similar mess on sensitive sites. <br><br><h6>  Pps </h6><br>  Recently a group of diggers (it‚Äôs really not clear how to call them correctly) climbed to the most secret facility in Moscow, NPO Energomash named after academician V.P.Glushko, which is the world's leading enterprise for the development of powerful liquid-propellant rocket engines for space launch vehicles.  Just <b>went through the hole in the fence</b> !  We went there for 5 nights.  No one noticed them, although the cameras were there until beautiful photos <a href="http://lana-sator.livejournal.com/160176.html">appeared in LiveJournal</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/135681/">https://habr.com/ru/post/135681/</a></p>
