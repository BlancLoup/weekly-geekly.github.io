When I ran into it, I began to figure it out, and this is what Beeline and the company that calls itself ‚Äútechnical support for paid numbers‚Äù told me together: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

      1. In Beeline there is a service called "Mobile Click".  Its essence boils down to the fact that if you browse a particular website through the Internet, received via a biline SIM card, and click on the link that leads to the site owned by the content provider company, then the fact of clicking on the link will be perceived as the subscriber‚Äôs desire to subscribe to (regular) payment for the services of this third company <i>from the subscriber‚Äôs account in Beeline</i> .  At the same time, Beeline <i>transfers the phone number of the subscriber's SIM card to</i> another site - namely, the content provider site. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  2. Desire, however, this is not a subscription yet - confirmation is required.  To get it on the page where the link leads the content provider places the question of whether the customer really wants to pay for such a subscription, and with the "buy" or "agree" button, clicking on which completes the process.  They clicked ‚Äúbuy‚Äù - the money will be withdrawn (in the comments, however, they give an example that the content provider was not punished, even when both buttons, ‚Äúagree‚Äù and ‚Äúdisagree‚Äù, hung up the subscription - they say, this is a conscious action user, ie the contract is not broken) <br><br>  3. We all understand that you can arrange the link and the confirmation page mentioned above in a variety of ways, even one that will mislead a person and lead to an unexpected write-off of money.  Beeline argues, however, that they are not able to monitor compliance with the design rules of all such sites, and if something in the design and violated, or information about such confirmation of the subscription will be transmitted by the content provider erroneously, then no special sanctions Beeline to content the provider will not have - just deduct the cost of the wrong subscription from the amounts paid, return the money to the subscriber, and close the topic. <br><br>  4. On the question of how this Beeline subscriber‚Äôs money without the consent of the subscriber himself (moreover - without a principal permission for such transfers in general) translates (literally - believing the content provider to the word), and even at the expense of third companies, in Beeline TP they only expressed confidence that they have no right to prevent subscribers from spending their money on anything.  As for the correctness of the subscription itself, the notorious technical errors (if, say, instead of one subscriber, they signed another, or signed, and there was no confirmation in fact - can you imagine some options?), And other ‚Äútrifles‚Äù, then here‚Äôs Beeline He directly washed his hands with his TP: they say, they don‚Äôt bear responsibility for other sites, they only maintain and maintain <a href="http://www.beeline.ru/">www.beeline.ru</a> . <br><br>  5. Content providers can create any number of sites with any schemes for working with visitors - Beeline does not have a list of sites, it does not have the ability to track them, except (after my persistent questions, how can I understand where I can go for ‚Äúordinary money‚Äù ", And where - it may be very expensive) offered to provide an" outdated and incomplete list of resources ", where a subscription is generally possible.  Moreover, on the Beeline website, no matter how it is updated, there is no complete list or even a clear description of the Mobile Click service, but the TP doesn‚Äôt bother it - they say the same service is free, why talk about it in detail? <br><br>  By the way, for the curious, I want to clarify: in Beeline, it was possible to place a ban on sending SMS to short numbers, and so this ban does not protect against a subscription via Mobile Click, although such a subscription goes further in billing as a subscription by sending SMS.  You can protect against a new subscription option with the help of the free ‚Äúblack and white list‚Äù service. <br><br>  One thing is good - content providers, out of harm's way, usually send a notifying SMS to the newly subscribed subscriber about the fact of the subscription itself.  True, it seems to be a voluntary matter, they didn‚Äôt send it ‚Äî it‚Äôs not good, but Beeline will not tell them either here, and they will write off for technical difficulties.  In addition, as rightly pointed out in the comments, you can send SMS and not immediately, but in a few days - the person and the money will be written off, and the fact of a subscription will be more difficult to associate with a specific site. <br><br>  Why am I writing this?  There are a lot of ways for a relatively fair increase in profits from a subscriber by cellular companies.  But, if the paid SMS-ki tool, though profitable, but requires some actions from the user, then place on the site page a link that signs the subscriber for an extra expense - that's where the breakthrough!  After all, the link can be placed on any object page, and on quite respectable sites (yes there specific sites - Google AdWords to help, not to mention Russian, not very clean, advertising networks!), And make the confirmation page so that 99% of visitors They will not understand that this is an additional cost. <br><br>  Personally, I seriously thought that surfing the Internet from a smartphone is best through VPN, leading to some kind of server.  At the same time, I‚Äôll cover the operator‚Äôs curves and inspections of traffic by the operator, and I‚Äôll not get, even by chance, to such a ‚Äúvoluntary subscription‚Äù. <br><br>  PS The fact that the site of the content provider receives information about the SIM number, the Internet through which I use, didn‚Äôt see Beeline‚Äôs TP.  However, when asked to tell my site how to receive the same information (I just thought it would be great to greet a visitor to my site with the phase ‚ÄúGood morning, dear user with the phone number +79091112233!‚Äù), They hesitated ... <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> By reading the comments, I‚Äôve increasingly come to the idea that Habrayuzer would need to create HabraVPN, which, without any illegality, would simply allow it to get around the Internet that was rotten with its financial approach from mobile operators, and at least just to work confidently and fearlessly with the internet.  And at the same time to get HabraDNS (maybe Yandex with its public DNS will help?), Where the website addresses of content operators resolved to the address of a stub server safe in the sense of money.
