  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Domestic chip manufacturing plant 130 nm</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  As I read the material about the <a href="http://www.zelenograd.ru/news/view.php3%3Fid%3D4047">unfinished factory "Angstrom-T"</a> and decided to see whether any work on its construction is really underway and if it is done and what has already been done.  Since I still live near the place of the proposed construction, we went with a friend to the place of the proposed construction to clarify the situation. <br><br>  Briefly about the background: Vnesheconombank (VEB) will become the owner of the Zelenograd company Angstrem-T.  The company was unable to pay the loan of VEB obtained for the construction of a new microchip plant, and the bank decided to take a pledge, which includes not only the shares and land of the plant, but even its current equipment and the future 130 nm chip production line acquired from AMD.  Information about this was published yesterday by the newspaper Vedomosti.  Among the sources is one of the partners of the Angstrom group and a source close to VEB.  "In the future, the previous shareholders will be able to buy the plant," adds the publication. <br><br>  Here is what official public information writes. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cfb/9b5/bf2/cfb9b5bf2332b9af8a48b89b9a823021.jpg" alt="image">

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  The date of the end of construction is indicated on the 2nd quarter of 2011, as it is written in the article.  Although it was already a deadline for 2009.  So the end date may change. <br><br>  Quote: ‚ÄúAt the same time, the Finance portal announced in August 2009, according to Angstrem's top management, that a full-scale production start of 130 nm technology is planned for the beginning of 2011, without explaining the reasons for the postponement.  However, Dmitry Milovantsev, the general director of Angstrom-T, does not confirm the change of plans: ‚ÄúThe shares of Angstrom-T are laid in VEB.  All decisions on the company require coordination <a href="http://www.finansmag.ru/articles/30196">with the bank</a> .  While the plans have not changed, ‚Äùadds Finance.‚Äù <br><br>  Behind the fence is a building that is not very similar to the plant if you are guided by the picture on the shield (The color is blue there, and in real life it is yellow and the configuration doesn‚Äôt quite match).  Maybe this is a feature of the structure.  To the left of the frame is the building of the customs terminal (TSW) of Angstrem OJSC.  Builders can not see where are they? <br><img src="http://s54.radikal.ru/i144/1001/59/985ecf432e9e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Found the houses of the alleged builders of the shield exactly the same as hung on the fence, but no activity was found.  From myself I can say that before this place was an iron hangar.  And to the left is now the building of Zelenograd customs. <br><img src="http://i065.radikal.ru/1001/43/74448d72617a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the territory of the alleged line, next to the building, there is a pit of unknown origin. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/68d/ee1/589/68dee1589bf5be41ba8542407c611d26.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As the above-mentioned source writes: ‚ÄúThe Angstrem-T tender portal provides some insight into the construction of a new plant: since the beginning of 2009, various engineering communications repair works have been under way at the plant ‚Äî sewage and power grids, earthworks and the installation of bored piles.‚Äù  The majority of tenders from May to September 2009 are listed as ‚Äúpending‚Äù.  As for the previous year, 2008, there is no data on it.  The latest tender, announced by Angstrom-T, involves preparing the M + W Zander building under construction for the winter - ‚Äúclosing openings of different sizes,‚Äù the technical task says. ‚Äù <br><br>  M + W Zander name already flashed on the shield.  What kind of openings were closed behind the scenes) By the way, the site of tenders, like the site of Angstrem-T, is <a href="http://tenders.angstrem-t.com/">not available</a> now. <br><img src="http://s40.radikal.ru/i089/1001/ea/aba7ff84a7cb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Further investigations were decided to be curtailed because they <s>had already received the protection of the cap</s> froze. <br><br>  Quote: ‚ÄúAs Vedomosti wrote in August 2008,‚Äú AMD equipment has been paid for and is in a warehouse in the Netherlands, ‚ÄùAngstrem‚Äôs deputy general director Yevgenia Kolosova says, there are no warehouses in Russia where you can store it.  In the autumn, as soon as a clean room is installed at the plant under construction in Zelenograd, it will be brought ‚Äù.  "Since that time, practically nothing has been done, the construction has not advanced a single step." <br><br>  By the way, the line for the production of 180 nm chips was purchased in 2007 at <a href="http://www.rg.ru/2007/12/13/ivanov.html">the Mikron plant</a> .  But still <a href="http://www.avanturist.org/forum/index.php/topic,358.msg449930.html">not running</a> . <br><br>  Instead of conclusion, the places described are located 600 meters from the place where one of the <a href="http://zelzritel.ru/films/otroki.html">episodes of the film</a> ‚ÄúYouths in the Universe‚Äù was shot when it was once the embodiment of progress in the USSR. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a4d/b2b/a9d/a4db2ba9d4f85b432b390b06c295a5a2.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/80142/">https://habr.com/ru/post/80142/</a></p>
