Any C #, ASP.NET, Winforms, WPF I already dream about.  I am even now writing this article and simultaneously debuffing another mold on WPF, which no one except the customer will use. <br>  As a result, with a frequency of a couple of months, the thought ‚ÄúHow long?  We must do something socially useful and interesting! ". <br>  But here the ideas of something socially useful, necessary and not yet made were refused to visit me. <br>  Everything has changed dramatically thanks to my wife, who has finally come to make a diploma.  I was threatened by the fact that she was the only Macbook in the family to expropriate indefinitely.  What do IT people cut off from the computer and from the wife?  That's right, they drink beer and watch TV shows.  Series, by that time I was looking at <a href="http://soap4.me/">soap4.me</a> for a long time and successfully.  And now, being left alone with my iPhone, I got the idea that I'm probably not the only one.  It would be convenient for many people to lie down on the sofa with their ipad and, having included a new series of something, to grow myself an extra centimeter of so-called.  beer belly.  And there was a reason to apply Objective-C / Cocoa Touch knowledge obtained from books, articles, video tutorials and a heap of Hell Worlds.

    <a name="habracut"></a><h4>  Start. </h4><br>  Rejoicing, I immediately wrote to the guys from soap4.me that here I am, an altruistic person who will write you an application for iOS.  And right there, a mountain from WPF, Winforms, SQL and other things fell on me at the main job, so I had to temporarily stop thinking about socially useful things.  Meanwhile, my wife completed her diploma, gave me a macbook, and life went on as usual.  And then came the vacation, which for some family reasons I had to spend not on the seashore, but at my parents' house.  As a result, armed with books and video tutorials, I began to make my socially useful Hello World, occasionally alternating this pleasure with the help of parents in the household. <br><br><h4>  Cydia. </h4><br>  Immediately thinking that the translated series - this is the most that neither is a sample of unlicensed content, I reconciled with the fact that society will have to benefit through Cydia and only on devices with a jailbreak.  But since  I really wanted to use such an application, it didn‚Äôt become a hindrance - there was more than enough enthusiasm.  A solution was quickly found on how to develop devices with a jail without participating in the iOS Developer Program.  Having added a couple of versions to the repository in Cydia, I began to encounter sudden problems and realize that this is somehow awkward.  I even had a chance to ponder a bit in the comments on <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/149402/">this</a> article and share some of my experiences.  As a result, having come to the conclusion that distributing normal applications that do not carry the meaning of tight integration with the operating system, through Cydia is not worth it, I decided to distribute the application as a simple .ipa file that users with installed AppSync could install by themselves through Installous or iTunes.  This went on for quite a long time, until I spat on everything and decided not to try my luck in the App Store. <br><br><h4>  App Store. </h4><br>  Having previously asked for advice on the forums and on <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/qa/24315/">Habr√©</a> , despite the absolute majority of answers in the spirit of "Yes, this is no chance, boy!", I decided to try to publish.  In case of refusal, I had one argument: a bunch of applications for watching videos from VKontakte, which is no more legal than innocuous serials.  At stake, in fact, was only my time and $ 100 for participating in the iOS Developer Program.  Having treated all this as an investment in a loved one, I got down to business.  By that time, there were already a decent amount of people who wanted to see the application in the App Store, which only fueled interest in how it would all end.  Having gathered an army of interested beta testers via TestFlight, all that remained was to please them with regular new versions.  I myself also tested the application regularly: if I had the strength, I looked at the episode of theirs, which I had accumulated overlooked during development, before bedtime.  By the way, about the beta test: despite about 30 registered UDID, judging by the data from TestFlight, 40% of users used the application.  Valuable feedback was only from a couple of users, for which of course many thanks to them.  The remaining 60% in fact turned out to be a waste of valuable places for UDID, which you can add only 100 per year. <br>  And this is despite the fact that all users had a premium account on the site, which in theory should automatically allocate from the crowd only those who would really be interested in using the application.  Well, okay, it happens. <br><br>  Having received a lot of valuable advice and squeezed the most out of the provided API, I decided that it was time to finish the beta test, and sent the application for review by the censors.  I did not particularly hope for success, and I wasn‚Äôt particularly upset when I saw a letter stating that the application was rejected.  But after reading the reason for the refusal, I was delighted.  The application was rejected under clause 11.12 of the App Store Review Guidelines:  To use the application you need a premium account, its purchase must be realized through an in-app purchase.  And not a word about copyright to content!  Of course, there was a chance that this could be the next reason for the refusal, but still it was great to motivate for further action.  In-App Purchase, I rushed to implement on the same day closer to the night, and managed to make sure that it is not so easy in my case.  First, I needed a bank account to withdraw money, which I did not have.  Being involved in bureaucratic banking processes was not part of my plans.  In addition, without having access to the server part, the implementation of the server code also did not promise to be fast.  As a result, thanks to one of my beta testers, an application was found that works absolutely in the same way, but published in the App Store. <br>  It was given as an example in the Resolution Center with the question "Why are they the same, but you don‚Äôt let me in?"  Either the censor got imputed, or they are all there, but we agreed that I would remove the links from the application to the website page, from which you can directly or indirectly get to the premium account purchase page, and everything will be ok. <br><br><h4>  Nooooo </h4><br>  I did it quickly, at the same time adding a couple of small things, and was already going to send the next version for consideration, as a very sad event happened - I had a freshly bought SSD that had not worked for four months.  Then it didn‚Äôt really upset me because  everything important, including all the code along with the local git repository, was synchronized with Google Drive.  But the following events shocked me, from which I departed all day.  In Google Drive were very old versions of the files, and the files with the description of the UI (storyboard) were completely absent.  In this case, all there photos were synchronized.  In general, having made for myself the conclusion that Google Drive has a big trouble with synchronizing changes to files already added there, and loudly cursed it, I canceled the purchased subscription and purchased a Dropbox subscription, where I transferred those 30% of the code that I have saved.  Pokhandri little, decided not to throw everything halfway, and began to write everything again.  Little time passed, and entire pieces of written code remained in memory, so over the next 3 days everything was rewritten from scratch, at the same time refreshed and ready for the next publication attempt. <br><br><h4>  This is a success! </h4><br>  A week ago, I sent the application for review, and in a record short 6 days I received a message that my application is Ready For Sale.  And it happened on Sunday.  Apparently the censors felt all the troubles that I had to endure during the development process, and went to work on the weekend in order to please me. <br><br>  The fruits of my labors can be fully enjoyed by registering on <a href="http://soap4.me/">soap4.me</a> , paying a couple of bucks a month and downloading the application from the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/soap4all/id569092007%3Fl%3Dru%26ls%3D1%26mt%3D8">link</a> . <br>  The application works on all iOS devices with iOS&gt; = 5.0 on board. <br>  The designer of me is useless, so the appearance is relatively spartan, but people like it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0a9/3bc/c66/0a93bcc66532e9c39f05bb4306c88f5b.png"><br><br>  There are many further plans: <br>  - push notifications about new episodes; <br>  - synchronization of the time to stop the episode between devices and the browser; <br>  - covers for the seasons; <br>  - interface for iPad. <br><br>  There are also plans to talk about some of the nuances of development, because  I truly believe that I had to come across something interesting and, again, useful to someone. <br><br>  What can be learned from this long opus?  Well, for example the fact that you should not make hasty conclusions, be afraid to try and throw at failures at intermediate stages.  Or that it is not necessary to skimp on $ 100 a year, because  the development and subsequent distribution through Cydia is one more hemorrhoids.  Or that the App Store is not the same.  In general, each will make something of their own, but I want to believe that it will be useful. <br><br>  In the meantime, download, register and see not to be seen. <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> .  3G viewing had to be turned off due to Apple's requirements, stating that video streaming over cellular networks should be implemented via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming">HTTP Live Streaming</a> , which in turn imposes many restrictions on the format of the content provided.  Therefore, in the first version, I decided to do everything to eliminate unnecessary risks when publishing.  In the next versions I will try to remove this restriction. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/158517/">https://habr.com/ru/post/158517/</a></p>
