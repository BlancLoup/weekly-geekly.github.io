  <section class="page js-page"><h1>RTOS Neutrino in Industrial Computers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  About a month ago a seminar, which had already become traditional, was held by the SVD Company Embedded Systems and SVD Software.  At the seminar, representatives of the industry spoke about the development trends of protected RTOS of the KPDA family (Neutrino, Neutrino-E, QNX) and tools for building automated systems based on AORV, etc. The seminar consisted of three sections.  In total, he was visited by about 180 people.  More information about the Neutrino RTOS is available <a href="http://kpda.ru/products/">on the</a> developer‚Äôs <a href="http://kpda.ru/products/">website</a> and on <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/QNX">Wikipedia</a> . <br>  In addition to the seminar, a small demo zone was organized, where companies that somehow came into contact with the CPDA family of CPDA showed their solutions.  In one place were collected components (processors) and equipment, which were presented mainly by Russian manufacturers of computer technology.  Some of this has already been repeatedly covered either through press releases or on various information portals, but there was also something new. <br><br>  A lot of photos! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ra/wc/dr/rawcdr0fv_8csnmvsxegpv6wvqg.jpeg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As can be seen from the description <a href="http://www.kpda.ru/products/kpda10964/">on the</a> developer's <a href="http://www.kpda.ru/products/kpda10964/">website</a> , the EPRP EPRS family supports all the main processor architectures, which also produce industrial equipment in Russia.  According to my subjective feelings, the largest number of complete commercial solutions that are available to consumers were on the x86 and Elbrus architecture, although there were MIPS, and ARM, and RISC, and SPARCv8. <br>  The x86 was a development kit from the company Fastwel, running under the auspices of the Neurino ATP, and consisting of the COM Express Type 10 CPC1311 processor module on the Intel Atom platform and the KIB1400 media board.
