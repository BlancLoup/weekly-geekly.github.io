And what is the difference?  Do you want to know? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Immediately I warn you that I do not like terms like ‚ÄúTlog‚Äù, I will talk about Mini-blogs and Microblogs. <br><h2>  Miniblogging </h2><h3>  Tumblr.com </h3> <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/"><img title="http://www.tumblr.com/" height="152" alt="Snapshot from Tumblr.com" src="http://images.websnapr.com/?url=http://www.tumblr.com/&amp;amp;size=S" width="202" align="right"></a>  <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr.com</a> - in fact, the first project of mass miniblogging.  As mentioned above, a huge number of users are not blogs in their current understanding, not personal blogs, but what was originally called a weblog ‚Äî a directory of links and some notes about this and that.  The <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr.com</a> project brings us back exactly to this concept of blogging ‚Äúfound, saw - post‚Äù.  <b>No comments</b> , no headaches with the design.  Everything is extremely simple.  You can choose several themes from those offered by the creators of the service, or customize the color scheme for you.  You can add messages using the form on the website or from a mobile phone by sending messages to a specific mailing address.  You can attach to the post photos.  The only inconvenience is that you must keep the address given to you in complete secret, otherwise some hooligan will be able to use it and clutter up your message line.  The process of writing in such a mini-blog is quite simple: choose a category and add what you want.  The following options are currently available: <ul><li>  <b>Text</b> : regular entry. </li><li>  <b>Photo</b> : You can specify a link to a photo online or upload your own from a local computer in jpeg, gif, png or bmp format up to 10MB in size. </li><li>  <b>Quote</b> : quotation indicating the source, which is accordingly formed in large quotes. </li><li>  <b>Link</b> : specify the name of the link and the URL itself. </li><li>  <b>Chat</b> : inserts a conversation from IM or another chat, which is highlighted accordingly. </li><li>  <b>Video</b> : insert video (allowed direct link from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> or <a href="http://video.google.com/">Google Video</a> , or embed code from other services) </li></ul>  Commenting is not provided, however, according to recent developer statements, feedback will sooner or later appear on the site, the only question is what form.  Very interesting is the import of feeds from other network services.  This is exactly what, I am sure, many of you have sometimes thought about.  Now everything can be collected in one place: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> , <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> , <a href="http://www.last.fm/">Last.fm</a> , <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/">Livejournal</a> , <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> and all-all-all ... Thus, we can conclude that this service is useful not only for those who do not want burden yourself with too much knowledge about how it all works there, but also for those who actively use various Internet services. <h3>  Mmm ... Tasty! </h3> <a href="http://www.mmm-tasty.ru/"><img title="http://www.mmm-tasty.ru/" height="152" alt="Snapshot from M-m-m...Tasty" src="http://images.websnapr.com/?url=http://www.mmm-tasty.ru/&amp;amp;size=S" width="202" align="right"></a>  Quote creators <blockquote>  ‚Äú <a href="http://www.mmm-tasty.ru/">Mmm ... Tasty!</a>  - service for tlogs.  A tlog is something like a journal, diary or blog, but in a different format.  The conversation is conducted personally for oneself. Here they are not looking for old friends and do not make new acquaintances.  And here everything is done so that you can express yourself the way you want it.  Therefore, there are no restrictions.  You can do and behave here as you see fit.  To be youreself.  And we are trying to do everything so that you have complete freedom here. ‚Äù </blockquote>  The creation of this service by the authors was inspired by the example of the aforementioned <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr.com</a> , however, having got on Russian soil, the service slightly changed.  The main differences include the presence of comments (disabled by default);  adding additional categories for recordings: <b>Music</b> (publishing an mp3-file) and <b>Code</b> (publishing a program or html code);  the possibility of voting for posts.  Thus, in my opinion, <a href="http://www.mmm-tasty.ru/">Mmm ... tasty</a> violate the concept stated initially and create a reduced version of <a href="http://livejournal.com/">Livejournal</a> .  Service is constantly evolving, we will look further;) <h2>  Microblogging </h2>  Recently, in my LiveJournal, the number of records I sent there via a mobile phone has become more frequent.  Taking into account the fact that I use a rather old phone, its possibilities for such an activity plan are very limited (I couldn‚Äôt even <a href="http://www.xfyre.com/sw/lj2me/">deliver Lj2ME</a> ), so the entries were rarely longer than 140 characters ... It turns out that this kind of reduced blogging has long been very widespread ... <h3>  Twitter.com </h3> <a href="http://twitter.com/"><img title="http://twitter.com/" height="152" alt="Snapshot from Twitter.com" src="http://images.websnapr.com/?url=http://twitter.com/&amp;amp;size=S" width="202" align="right"></a>  <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter.com</a> is a microblogging service that allows you to keep your own news feed.  And also be aware of events happening with your friends.  The appearance of the service is minimal, but you can customize the look of your ribbon by setting (or removing) the background image and determining the colors of some elements of the page.  You can add messages using the form on the website, via SMS and through any client that works via the Jabber protocol.  Message length is limited to 140 characters, formatting is not supported.  You can send messages arbitrarily, or configure the system so that it periodically asks you "What are you doing now?" You will only have to answer.  ‚ÄúExperimenting with microblogging services‚Äù or ‚ÄúBrushing my teeth before going to bed‚Äù.  To send messages to your tape on <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> using the phone, you need to confirm it by sending a message to the number <code>+447781488126</code> with the code word indicated on the site.  To work with <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> in <a href="http://www.google.com/talk/">Gtalk</a> , just fill in your contact list at <code>twitter@twitter.com</code> .  Your new messages on <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> will not appear as in your own feed, forming a certain microblogging, sent by SMS and Jabber to those who added you to ‚Äúfriends‚Äù.  You can make a user a friend, remove from the list of friends, start or stop watching him on the user's personal page or using special control commands.  Thus, you can manage the distribution of your own news, and subscriptions to other people's feeds.  It is necessary to take into account that when a user is added to the list of friends, observation of him is automatically included.  When you delete - turns off.  At the same time, you can turn off watching a friend and vice versa - watch a person without calling him a friend.  I would say that it is not very convenient, because  I, frankly, do not really like the idea that strangers are watching me.  The way out of this situation to some extent can serve as private message statuses.  You can send a message that is visible to everyone or only to those you have added as a friend.  Thus, you can keep up to date with a whole group of people and great to save on SMS.  The system also provides for the possibility of direct communication to someone, turning into a kind of SMS-chat, replacing the possibility of commenting records.  Authors and fans of the service have done everything to promote it to the masses: from special informers that display your tape or the tape of your friends, to integration into other services and platforms. <br><h3>  Jaiku.com </h3> <a href="http://jaiku.com/"><img title="http://jaiku.com/" height="152" alt="Snapshot from Jaiku.com" src="http://images.websnapr.com/?url=http://jaiku.com/&amp;amp;size=S" width="202" align="right"></a>  <a href="http://jaiku.com/">Jaiku</a> is a Finnish service that occupies an intermediate position at the border of mini- and microblogging.  This is no longer an ascetic <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> , but also not <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr.com</a> .  The appearance of the service is more loaded, compared to <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> , the settings are reduced to changing the background of your page.  You can add messages using the form on the website, via SMS, as well as by broadcasting feeds (which are divided into categories: Photo, Blog, Bookmarks, Music, Places, Event, Video, Other), which makes <a href="http://jaiku.com/">Jaiku</a> related to <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr.com</a> .  Message length is limited to 140 characters.  When writing a message, you can also assign it a certain icon to choose from.  For example, all messages from a mobile phone are marked with the appropriate sign.  To send a message to your tape on <a href="http://jaiku.com/">Jaiku</a> using the phone, you need to send a message to the number <code>+46 737 494 0501</code> .  To activate the number, you must specify it on the site, and then enter the confirmation code that will come to you via SMS.  Your new posts on <a href="http://jaiku.com/">Jaiku</a> will appear both in your own feed, forming a kind of microblogging, and sent by e-mail to those who added you to ‚Äúfriends‚Äù and agreed to receive these notifications.  Unlike <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter,</a> no SMS or IM notification is provided.  But it is possible to comment on messages (minimal formatting is supported - _ <i>italic</i> _, * <b>bold</b> *, [link text] (http://jaiku.com/)). <h3>  SMSpr.ru </h3> <a href="http://smspr.ru/"><img title="http://smspr.ru/" height="152" alt="Snapshot from SMSpr.ru" src="http://images.websnapr.com/?url=http://smspr.ru/&amp;amp;size=S" width="202" align="right"></a>  <a href="http://smspr.ru/">SMSpr</a> is a Russian clone of <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter.com</a> with cropped functionality.  The appearance of the service completely repeats <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> , the design settings are not significantly expanded.  You can add messages using the form on the website, via <a href="http://www.icq.com/">ICQ</a> , as well as via <a href="http://www.google.com/talk/">Gtalk</a> and Jabber (SMS support is expected soon).  More, in general, so far nothing to say. <h2>  Annex 1 </h2>  All the above information, I tried to systematize and the result was the following label: <br><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td></td><td>  Tumblr.com </td><td>  Mmm ... tasty </td><td>  Twitter.com </td><td>  Jaiku.com </td><td>  Smspr.ru </td></tr><tr><td colspan="6">  Adding records </td></tr><tr><td>  Online </td><td>  ‚Ä¢ </td><td>  ‚Ä¢ </td><td>  ‚Ä¢ </td><td>  ‚Ä¢ </td><td>  ‚Ä¢ </td></tr><tr><td>  Via SMS </td><td>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288698/"><sup>1</sup></a> </td><td>  - </td><td>  ‚Ä¢ </td><td>  ‚Ä¢ </td><td>  - <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288698/"><sup>2</sup></a> </td></tr><tr><td>  Via IM </td><td>  - </td><td>  - </td><td>  ‚Ä¢ </td><td>  - </td><td>  ‚Ä¢ </td></tr><tr><td>  Through mobile apps </td><td>  - </td><td>  - </td><td>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288698/"><sup>3</sup></a> </td><td>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288698/"><sup>4</sup></a> </td><td>  - </td></tr><tr><td colspan="6">  Categories of publicity </td></tr><tr><td>  Visible to all </td><td>  ‚Ä¢ </td><td>  ‚Ä¢ </td><td>  ‚Ä¢ </td><td>  ‚Ä¢ </td><td>  ‚Ä¢ </td></tr><tr><td>  Only friends </td><td>  ‚Ä¢ </td><td>  ‚Ä¢ </td><td>  ‚Ä¢ </td><td>  ‚Ä¢ </td><td>  ‚Ä¢ </td></tr><tr><td>  Only myself </td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>  ‚Ä¢ </td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="6">  Integration / Settings </td></tr><tr><td>  Feed support export / import) </td><td>  ‚Ä¢ / ‚Ä¢ </td><td>  ‚Ä¢ / - </td><td>  ‚Ä¢ / - </td><td>  ‚Ä¢ / ‚Ä¢ </td><td>  ‚Ä¢ / - </td></tr><tr><td>  Insert in the image recording </td><td>  ‚Ä¢ </td><td>  ‚Ä¢ </td><td>  - </td><td>  ‚Ä¢ <sup><a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288698/">5</a> , <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288698/">6</a></sup> </td><td>  - </td></tr><tr><td>  Insertion in video recording </td><td>  ‚Ä¢ </td><td>  ‚Ä¢ </td><td>  - </td><td>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288698/"><sup>6</sup></a> </td><td>  - </td></tr><tr><td>  Conversation with other users </td><td>  - </td><td>  - </td><td>  ‚Ä¢ </td><td>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288698/"><sup>6</sup></a> </td><td>  ‚Ä¢ </td></tr><tr><td>  Comments </td><td>  - <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288698/"><sup>2</sup></a> </td><td>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288698/"><sup>7</sup></a> </td><td>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288698/"><sup>8</sup></a> </td><td>  ‚Ä¢ </td><td>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288698/"><sup>8</sup></a> </td></tr><tr><td>  Theme support / Custom design </td><td>  ‚Ä¢ / ‚Ä¢ </td><td>  ‚Ä¢ / ‚Ä¢ </td><td>  - / ‚Ä¢ </td><td>  - / ‚Ä¢ </td><td>  - / ‚Ä¢ </td></tr><tr><td colspan="6">  <font>1- With MMS / E-mail.</font> <font><br></font>  <font>2 - In the future.</font> <font><br></font>  <font>3 - When using third-party applications.</font> <font><br></font>  <font>4- Available program for Nokia phones S60 series)</font> <font><br></font>  <font>5 - Ability to insert icons for each entry.</font> <font><br></font>  <font>6 - When using crossposting through importing feeds.</font> <font><br></font>  <font>7- Disabled by default.</font> <font><br></font>  <font>8 - By answering a post to a post or a direct appeal.</font> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><h2>  Appendix # 2 </h2><h3>  Alternative </h3>  If your phone is not as old as my M50, then you will be able to do without activating SMS messages.  It is enough to install a mobile browser like <a href="http://operamini.com/">Opera Mini</a> and use it to add entries <i>as if</i> through the Web or use mobile IM clients like <a href="http://www.jimm.org/">Jimm</a> to add entries via IM. <br>  Another option is to use specialized phone applications ( <a href="http://jaiku.com/">Jaiku.com</a> even offer such a program for owners of the Nokia S60 series. They are Finns).  For <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> , for example, there is the <a href="http://www.tinytwitter.com/">Tiny Twitter</a> application, but I must immediately warn you that it has several disadvantages: it incorrectly handles passwords with special characters, so when using such passwords, you cannot work with it;  and the most terrible is that it incorrectly handles the Cyrillic alphabet, as a result of which your message becomes a meaningless set of characters.  And still quite an interesting question: the amount of traffic consumed.  If it is comparable to using <a href="http://operamini.com/">Opera Mini</a> , then why is it needed at all? <br>  If I made any inaccuracies, or you have something to add, do not hesitate;) Comment.  I will be glad. <br>  <font>When writing notes, materials from habr.ru, internetno.net, and the sites of the services themselves were used.</font> <br>  <font>This text may be used for non-commercial distribution, provided there is a link to the author.</font> </div>
