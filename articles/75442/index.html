      <i>Black PR and dirt, already at the age of 16 - FOR THE PASSION :(</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Another shame for mtog.ru!</i> <br><br>  The story of another dying mobile magazine, which became corrupt for a penny, trying to somehow survive ... <br><br>  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen! <br>  We would like to tell you about how electronic journals work in the CIS, in particular <i>MTOG</i> , and how it is blackmailing companies involved in the development of mobile games, knocking out money from all developers, including <i>NET Lizard</i> <br><br>  As a result of negotiations, ‚Äúblack PR people‚Äù are trying to get money from <i>NET Lizard</i> company by blackmail and threats <i>.</i> <br>  But, having understood that everything is useless, and they have no choice but to beat their heads against the wall, trying to somehow extend the days of another dying magazine <i>‚ÄúMTOG‚Äù</i> <br><br>  As a result, the next dirty creation <i>‚ÄúMTOG‚Äù is born,</i> which has already created a reputation among the majority of readers as a registered and dirty magazine in the CIS <br><br>  After the release, one of the most significant projects in the market of 3D games <br>  <i>3D Shadows of Egypt (3D Shadows of Egypt)</i> <br>  <a href="http://www.netlizard.net/%3Fpage%3Dgame_detail%3F%3Dru%26game_id%3D124">Link</a> <br><br>  <i>NET Lizard</i> received a lot of letters of appreciation for the game, which everyone, without exception, liked by users and gamers, and which became like a bone in the throat for competitors. <br><br>  The author of the article ‚ÄúCraving for Things‚Äù gave an example of how he (Maksim Ivanov) and <i>MTOG magazine</i> earn their pocket money by trying to blackmail companies developing mobile games. <br><br>  We attach below several letters that <i>NET Lizard</i> company received personally <br>  From the editor of the dirty journal <i>"MTOG" Ivanov Maxim</i> <br><br>  ‚Ä¶ NO COMMENTS‚Ä¶ <br>  Stylistics, spelling and punctuation given source;) <br><br>  <i>- October 22 19:08</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Maxim Ivanov</i> <i><br></i>  <i>We have a certain long time ago ...</i> <i><br></i>  <i>mm ... how to put it more voraciously ... let's say, rates.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>We can pay a certain amount for writing a large, colorful article involving the best authors of the magazine, say, like me or Maxim.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>You, probably, were surprised by his article about Egypt, but, understand for yourself - who pays, then he gets the biggest and most tasty morsel - we also want to live, work and get paid for our hard publishing work.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>We were paid what we would not quite flattering to write about you, but they fantastically painted the Collider, but I think you yourself noticed it.</i>  <i>But even in his article on Egypt, even despite the fact that we were paid, he could not put less than 9.5 points, the game still impressed him a lot, as you noticed correctly, he seemed to prove something to himself .</i>  <i>But the system is a system, who paid, he is right, today in money is power.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>So, that's me.</i>  <i>We have our own specific methods and solutions to the problems of our friends.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>You can pay us not only for the article that you personally like, but also for damage to the article for your competitors in the same field.</i>  <i>If, however, money has already been paid for the article, then we will simply lower the grade to them by a score, rummage deeper and, of course, we will find REALLY reasons to lower the grade, so we can</i> <i><br></i>  <i>In general, let's consider with you this question more deeply.</i>  <i>What exactly do you want from our magazine?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Frankly, we have long been waiting for such a correct and deliberate step from you.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Therefore, we ask you to provide us with your financial means to pay for our PR and laudatory ones, or our other ... hmm. Opportunities.</i>  <i>We ask you to describe everything as clearly as possible, to whom, what and how.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>-</i> <br>  Below is a letter, as the authors of the magazine describe their prices for BLACK PR, filth and custom articles, which unfortunately they can only write :( <br><br>  <i>- October 22 21:10</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Maxim Ivanov</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Good day!</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The ‚Äúbarter‚Äù procedure is quite simple: you transfer a certain amount to your WebMoney account with a protection code, we write an article, show it to you, if everything is ok, then after publishing the next number you tell us the protection code.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Prices are small:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Number play, article on 8 printed pages - 2500r</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Article on 4 pages - 1000r</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Normal article, on 1-2 printed pages - 300-500r</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Black PR - by agreement.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>-------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------- ----------------</i> <br><br>  PS Well, it‚Äôs a pity that there are simply no talented writers and journalists left ... <br>  The pursuit of Kopeks is done by novice journalists of the black genre. <br>  Which, alas, can not create and write anything, except for another low-quality, customized article <br><br>  And this is the essence of their activities :) <br>  Well, perhaps the end is already ... <br><br>  In response to your slander, the company <i>NET Lizard</i> <br>  will take certain measures, according to the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation. <br>  It is not for the first time that we are confronted with a similar situation, and believe me, extortionists ALWAYS remain punished, according to articles, in accordance with conscience and justice. <br><br>  According to the legislation of the Russian Federation on: <br><br>  <i>Maxim Ivanov ‚ÄúFaLLOuT_mAn_)))‚Äù</i> <i><br></i>  <i>(Chief Editor)</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Alexey Savochkin ‚Äúrayman‚Äù</i> <i><br></i>  <i>(deputy chief editor)</i> <br><br>  <i>NET Lizard Company</i> and Law Office <br>  <i>‚ÄúCriminal Law of Russia - A.V.</i>  <i>Reznichenko "</i> prepare financial and criminal lawsuit, which will be filed in the near future in the economic and arbitration court, according to the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation <br><br>  <i>Article 129.

Falsification of evidence</i> <br><br>  We are confident that those responsible will incur both financial and criminal penalties, according to the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation <br><br>  <b>Oddly enough, the letter does not disprove any fact from the article ‚ÄúThe thirst for profit‚Äù.</b>  <b>Appeared only unfounded accusations.</b>  <b>And for the sake of completeness, the author‚Äôs answer to Net Lizard is:</b> <br><br>  <b>"The mouth of the baby speaks ..."</b> <br><br>  What is journalism for me?  Obviously not a vocation, since I am studying on a completely different specialty, obviously not a means to earn money, since it will not bring any significant amount.  Rather, it's just a hobby.  It is interesting for me to convey my opinion to a large number of people, to listen to their opinions on this issue, to learn something new.  This is akin to discussing something on the forum - only my ‚Äúcomments‚Äù are much more extensive.  During the ten months that we exist, I gained a lot of experience in dealing with completely different people, learned to lead a harmonious team, to influence the opinion of the masses.  But any hobby should bring satisfaction.  Therefore, I do not think that in my opinion I should be guided by the reaction of the crowd.  I have the right to evaluate something only on the basis of personal experience, of personal preferences.  Therefore, for me, a game in which there is a ‚Äúzest‚Äù, but the creators of which simply did not have enough money for modern graphics and special effects, is much higher than the one on whose development huge sums were spent, but it turns out to be an empty wrapper.  In any project, the main thing is his ‚Äúsoul‚Äù, the attitude of its creators towards him.  Although, of course, you have every right to disagree with me.  But I don‚Äôt urge to support me in anything, I just express my opinion. <br>  So who said that the gaming press should be limited only to reviews of games and responses to readers' letters?  It should not only reflect the world around it, but also try to influence it, change it for the better.  Utopia?  Perhaps, but still why shouldn't I do what I can?  I have always admired people who, for the sake of ideas, opposed themselves to more powerful organizations and often stood up in this struggle.  I think their names are familiar to many.  So is it better to be inert or carry the truth?  Again, it‚Äôs up to you to decide, because each person has his own road in this life. <br>  When I started writing the article <i>‚ÄúThirst for Profit,‚Äù</i> I was most afraid that it would go unnoticed and slip past the reader‚Äôs gaze.  Fortunately, this was not the case.  The article was noticed, disputes began, in which, as they say, the truth is born.  I understand the position of those who prefer not to believe us, in fact, still children, but a well-known developer.  I only wonder why it is necessary to pour so much dirt on my "corruption".  But this is not the main thing, because many readers are grateful for what they have written, they really discovered a lot for themselves.  And this means that my mission as a journalist has been successfully accomplished. <br>  Frankly, among other things, I wanted to hear the feedback from <i>Net Lizard</i> .  She was not there for quite a long time, I already had time to be disappointed, because the worst thing they could do was just to ignore me.  But something happened that I hoped for - they addressed to all users of the <i>Seclub</i> forum, which was well-known among the players of the forum, about our magazine.  They chose a very strange method in order to bring this information to everyone‚Äôs ears - many identical posts every few pages, spam in each user's personal box - what is this if not an attempt to create a cheap sensation? <br>  And now, according to numerous requests from readers, the answers to unspoken questions contained in their "letter." <br>  Screaming statements in the title, as it resembles the yellow press on the counter of the tray at the subway. <br>  <i>"FBI agents seek world domination",</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚ÄúThe directors of the kindergarten were caught trying to bribe‚Äù</i> <br>  - and so on in the same vein.  Gentlemen, why don't you try yourself in the press?  I am sure that many people would like your style.  But this is all the little things, go straight to the main topics.  I will build the next part of the article in the style of comments. <br>  <b>NetLizard</b> - <i>‚Äúhow he blackmails companies involved in the development of mobile games, knocking out money from all developers, including NET Lizard‚Äù</i> <br>  <b>Am I</b> <i>blackmailing the company?</i>  <i>Loud statement.</i>  <i>It will be extremely interesting for our readers and all those who are watching the development of events to find out from whom else we knock out money.</i>  <i>By the way, it is interesting to me.</i>  <i>As for our financial relations, we‚Äôll talk a little bit later in the text</i> . <br>  <b>Net Lizard</b> - <i>‚ÄúAs a result of negotiations, black PR people are trying by blackmail and threats to get money from NET Lizard.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>But, realizing that everything is useless, and they have no choice but to beat their heads against the wall, trying to somehow extend the days of another dying magazine "MTOG" ‚Äù</i> <br>  <b>I</b> - <i>you cited as a ‚Äúproof‚Äù a screenshot of our letter to you.</i>  <i>I will do the same, because it is exactly such a step that they expect from me.</i>  <i>In Thirst for Profit, I did not conceal the facts, I just did not want to overload the article with a huge number of screenshots of letters, so I published the excerpts.</i>  <i>But it's time to put all the correspondence to the audience.</i> <br><br>  <b>1.</b> It all started with a letter from <i>Net Lizard</i> to our editorial office on May 14th of this year. <br>  <a href="">Screen</a> <br>  Emphasis should be placed on the last paragraph of their letter, where it was proposed to describe the game together.  Of course, this idea came to me absolutely not to my liking, because the reviews should be impartial.  This letter has been refused.  Of course, there was no crime in this sentence.  But it's not about that. <br><br>  <b>2.</b> And now - the main part of the correspondence.  I bring it in full. <br>  Correspondence with <i>games@netlizard.net</i> <br>  <a href="">Screen 1</a> <br>  <a href="">Screen 2</a> <br>  <a href="">Screen 3</a> <br>  <a href="">Screen 4</a> <br>  Correspondence with <i>public@netlizard.net</i> <br>  <a href="">Screen 1</a> <br>  <a href="">Screen 2</a> <br>  <a href="">Screen 3</a> <br>  <a href="">Screen 4</a> <br>  <a href="">Screen 5</a> <br><br>  Immediately I will clarify - I communicated with <i>Net Lizard</i> from Maxim‚Äôs post office.  Nothing convincing yet, right?  And remember the lines from the article <i>‚ÄúThirst for Profit‚Äù</i> : <b><i>‚ÄúI decided not to leave it just like that and continued our discussion in order to get more evidence of an attempt to bribe.‚Äù</i></b> If someone else did not understand, then it was a standard divorce to obtain evidence of an attempt to bribe .  So now I advise you to read the screenshots again.  And the last thing on this point: notice who first spoke about money ... <br><br>  So, let's continue our story ... <br>  <b>Net Lizard</b> - <i>‚ÄúThe author of the article‚Äú Thirst for Money ‚Äùgave an example of how he (Maxim Ivanov) and the magazine‚Äú MTOG ‚Äúearn their pocket money by trying to blackmail companies that develop mobile games‚Äù</i> <br>  <b>I</b> - <i>‚ÄúFirst, open your eyes, gentlemen.</i>  <i>The author of the article is Yegor Tolstoy.</i>  <i>He is also the chief editor of the magazine.</i>  <i>So, I brought screenshots.</i>  <i>Where is the blackmail attempt? ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  <b>Net Lizard</b> - <i>"In response to your slander, the company NET Lizard</i> <i><br></i>  <i>will take certain measures, according to the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>It is not for the first time that we are confronted with a similar situation, and believe me, extortionists ALWAYS remain punished, according to articles, in accordance with conscience and justice.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>According to the legislation of the Russian Federation on:</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Maxim Ivanov ‚ÄúFaLLOuT_mAn_)))‚Äù</i> <i><br></i>  <i>(Chief Editor)</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Alexey Savochkin "rayman"</i> <i><br></i>  <i>(deputy chief editor) ¬ª</i> <br>  <b>I</b> - <i>And where are they?</i>  <i>The author of the article, as already mentioned, I, and all responsibility - only for me.</i>  <i>The magazine is not a registered organization, so my actions are not related to the rest of the team.</i> <br><br>  <b>Net Lizard</b> - <i>‚ÄúArticle 129. Slander</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Article 130. Insult</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Article 163. Extortion</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Article 303. Falsification of evidence. ‚Äù</i> <br>  <b>I</b> - <i>‚ÄúEven I, with my very poor knowledge of the field of jurisprudence, after fleeting acquaintance with all the articles made sure that this threat was sucked from the finger.</i>  <i>Try to get acquainted with the amendments, maybe you will understand everything. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  And let me ask a question to the developers.  Why didn‚Äôt you in a letter answer our accusations?  Do you recognize your plagiarism?  If not, then bother to disprove it.  Readers want to know the details. <br><br>  Of course, we are just children.  According to the laws of our country, I remain a child for several months.  But, as the title of the article says, ‚Äúthe mouth of the baby speaks ...‚Äù.  And what exactly says - true or false - is up to you, dear readers.  I will ask you only about one thing - try to argue your angry posts.  I want to specifically know what we are doing wrong. <br><br>  <b>"The mouth of the baby speaks ..."</b> <br><br>  What is journalism for me?
