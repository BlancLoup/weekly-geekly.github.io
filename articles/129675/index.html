      ‚ÄúThe presentation at the investment session of Glavstarta allowed us to come into contact with more than a dozen potential investors.  We managed not only to tell about our project, but also to receive valuable comments for us.  In addition, the presentation was attended by representatives of the target for us e-commerce market, several of which showed interest in our product and would like to test it on their sites.  Thus, the event turned out to be useful not only in terms of investment, but also for business development. ‚Äù <br><br>  The next meeting within the framework of the ‚ÄúVenture Discounter‚Äù is October 27, the registration of participants is <a href="http://startupweekend.timepad.ru/event/12218">already open</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ac2/ed3/b38/ac2ed3b3879594c32cfb6e7650ed631c.jpg" align="left">  The <strong>Bubble Well</strong> project is an alternative to traditional HR sites, built on life experience: new employees are found through acquaintances.  The service analyzes user connections in social networks and allows you to find work among your friends.  Analyzing the compatibility of the applicant and the employer, Bubble Well allows you to find an employee, based not so much on his resume, as on the human factor (which, in general, is usually decisive when applying for a job). <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6b3/e82/b01/6b3e82b0172253a085707622fe335dc4.png" align="left">  The authors of <strong>Sarafan</strong> decided to turn the disinterested ‚Äúword of mouth‚Äù into a viable Internet service: now you can get a discount on the purchase of anything by telling about this purchase in the social network.  Every time a friend makes a purchase using your tip, you get some of the money spent on the purchase back into your account.  The authors have already concluded an agreement with Yandex.Money about providing returns to service users. <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/07a/01b/f86/07a01bf867917f8f68e9656e41042d6d.png" align="left">  At the moment, " <strong><a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8-2-0/">Taxation</a></strong> " is the only software for individuals - not entrepreneurs, which allows you to quickly and easily prepare a tax return.  According to statistics provided by the authors, about half of all taxpayers - non-businessmen turn to paid consultants for the preparation of a tax return.  Now this function will be able to take on the online service.  In addition to the site, the project includes a web application for creating tax returns and an extensive information base on tax legislation. <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bad/b3a/718/badb3a718cc69628813115305363c463.png" align="left">  <strong>Sybo Robotics</strong> is a navigation system for mobile robots.  The system allows you to make 2-D maps of the surrounding space, determine the current coordinates of the robot on this map, plan the optimal route for the robot to move in space, detect and travel around dynamic and static obstacles.  The number of competitors, according to the authors, is calculated by one point - this is the Karto SDK project.
