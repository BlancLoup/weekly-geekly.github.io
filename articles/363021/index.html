Despite the fact that IT and golf are very different things, his experience gained over the years of interaction with customers can be very useful for selling absolutely any products. <br><br>  <b>Translator's note:</b> Probably, there may be doubts that this experience will be useful to us, because golf is clearly not our sport.  But, if you rethink the examples used by the author, and instead substitute something of your own, then you can learn a lot of very sensible ideas.  The essence of this article, in fact, is what should be the way of thinking in order to understand your potential client and make him happy.  So, take the path of success in working with this client. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, direct speech. <br><br>  In the field of golf to sell happiness is not too difficult.  You can tell golfers that their ball will go "farther than ever," and this is likely to work, especially with golf clubs and balls.  Here is an example from Titleist.

      You can be sure that large companies like Titleist know their customers very well - they are helped by formal research and informal reviews.  They list the benefits that resonate with their target customers: professional golfers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c7d/533/38c/c7d53338c31543d6b559e9732587e3cd.jpg" align="left"><br><br>  I hope this article will help you focus on selling happiness, which, in turn, will help increase conversion.  When you really find something that will make people happy, and attach the features and benefits of your product to the joy of customers, you will take the path of maximizing conversion. <br><br>  What is happiness?  I heard an interesting definition of this concept on the BBC radio show: it is freedom from fear.  My vocabulary defines happiness as a state during which you feel happy.  Not very clear. <br><br>  The definition of happiness in the dictionary should be as generalized as possible.  However, your job as a marketer is to find out what can really ‚Äúbother‚Äù your potential client and make him go crazy about the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãyour product (in this difficult task, by the way, you can be helped by such a fairly simple marketing tool as <a href="http://witget.com/blog/kak-sozdat-opros-polzovatelej-povyshayushhij-konversiyu/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3D15-11">customer surveys</a> ) . <br><br>  Then you need to show customers that you are able to fulfill your promise to make them happy.  And, when you learn to find the things that make people happy, you can even find additional ways to motivate them to buy the product and increase the conversion with their help.  More on this later. <br><br>  Let's go back to the world of golf.  I have already mentioned a good kick on the ball as the key to happiness in golf.  But if you dig a little deeper, you can find some other motivational factors for golfers that can make them happier. <br><br><ul><li>  Be more accurate. </li><li>  Drive as many balls into the hole as possible. </li><li>  Look cool. </li><li>  Impress your friends. </li><li>  Go out and have fun. </li><li>  Play in any weather. </li><li>  Knock as few points as possible. </li></ul><br>  The list of things that cause happiness is quite long, although golf is a fairly simple game.  Here is another example.  This time from Cobra Golf.  It draws attention to the fact that you get an instant discount. <br><br>  Yes, saving $ 100 will really make golfers happier.  Cobra's target audience are players who are conscious of the budget, so company representatives constantly emphasize their low prices and regular discounts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/527/3bd/a59/5273bda5978a455a9c4e194d0ff0af31.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  When it comes to selling golf club memberships, the motivational factors for customers who will increase their level of happiness are, again, fairly obvious: <br><br><ol><li>  Play golf whenever you want. </li><li>  Swimming pool for children. </li><li>  Opportunities for training. </li><li>  Golf for teens. </li><li>  Social events. </li><li>  A place where you can eat. </li></ol><br><br>  Take a look at this brochure dedicated to the club with the apt name of Bogey Hills Country Club.  They offer 13.5 (!) Reasons to join their club, and I‚Äôm sure that you can come up with more. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9af/cc5/6d0/9afcc56d09ae4239b4c2fc5d7411ff44.jpg" alt="image"><br>  . <br>  I have seen hundreds of brochures on golf courses and country clubs.  Most of them contain empty banalities "about shining fairway" (golf course) and "hearty welcome."  However, the simple brochure above contains several specific reasons that will help achieve happiness. <br><br>  Let's focus on the benefits that I have never fully realized until I began to write an advertising text, the purpose of which was to sell membership in a country club.  This is a networking! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3da/343/36c/3da34336cc3e4f01ab116692a336599a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As soon as you start really thinking about it, digging deeper and doing research, you will find other motivational factors for happiness, with which you can convince people to join the club. <br><br>  When I write a text that motivates me to join the ranks of golf club members, I always emphasize networking and the family aspect.  Having a place to meet and chat with other business people is a great advantage.  And the opportunity to be on the territory where children can play is also very important. <br><br>  The Bogey Hills brochure is a great example of how a company is making great efforts to provide a complete list of benefits that will bring happiness to golf club members and their family (click here for information on how to make offers more efficiently <a href="http://witget.com/blog/kak-povysit-uroven-konversii-celevoj-stranicy-s-pomoshhyu-psixologii-zhelaniya/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3D15-11">using the psychology of desire</a> ) . <br><br>  Let's take the example of the world of cars and trucks.  What really makes a person happy when it comes to his car?  Let's briefly list these factors. <br><br><ol><li>  Small monthly payment. </li><li>  Speed. </li><li>  Attracting factor. </li><li>  Utility. </li><li>  Audio system. </li><li>  Sizes. </li><li>  Mileage. </li><li>  Ecological characteristics. </li><li>  Sportiness. </li><li>  Security. </li></ol><br><br>  I must admit that the list was not too short.  Choosing a car and finding something that will make you happy causes a wide range of emotions. <br><br>  Safety brings happiness because it is freedom from fear of injury.  Low monthly payment saves money.  High speed satisfies the need for adrenaline.  High-quality sound system helps enough fun.  When a car looks unusual, it also makes its owner happy (something from a series of self-satisfaction). <br><br>  And for a person who feels happy about caring for the environment, mileage is also an important factor, along with low emissions. <br><br>  Thus, selling cars, you sell happiness ... regardless of what happiness means for each particular customer. <br>  In this example, happiness is an opportunity to save money, but at the same time buy a luxury car. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2a4/eab/a9d/2a4eaba9d18646eca8685a58a5e8fb70.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Thus, the motivators of happiness in this case - this is a low price and the luxury of owning a car of a famous brand. <br>  This site is aimed at people who find happiness in saving money, and get pleasure from having access to the latest updates. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/901/e1e/b5d/901e1eb5da7949e98ebdb424c9129084.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But here happiness comes from an exciting waiting process. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/729/28d/21f/72928d21f2904a4dac25669e4871726f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  When advertising cars, the marketer needs to focus on the element of happiness that most likely motivates people to make a purchase.  At the same time, it is worth mentioning other advantages that will also bring happiness to your customers.  My role as a direct response copywriter is to help increase conversion by listing an exhaustive list of benefits. <br><br>  Let's go to golf.  Here is the text from the webpage for the instructional DVD, created by a teacher from Arizona. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/539/536/446/53953644633640229a0aaaeb2dfde7b8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Here is a screenshot of the first 11 reasons.  Notice how deep I dug in to find all the benefits that golfers want to get. <br><br>  It seems to me that you can never learn a sufficient number of ways to help prove that you gave your customers as much happiness as possible.  That is why it is so important to know your target audience.  <a href="http://witget.com/blog/6-instrumentov-kotorye-pozvolyat-vsegda-ostavatsya-na-svyazi-s-klientami/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3D15-11">Talk to your customers.</a>  <a href="http://witget.com/blog/6-instrumentov-kotorye-pozvolyat-vsegda-ostavatsya-na-svyazi-s-klientami/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3D15-11">Listen to them.</a>  Usually they push you precisely on those ideas that are really important and useful. <br><br>  That is all I wanted to say in the first part.  In the second, I will discuss two other industries, as well as share some ideas on how to use customer happiness to increase conversion. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/363021/">https://habr.com/ru/post/363021/</a></p>
