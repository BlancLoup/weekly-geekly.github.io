    <h4>  Choo choo pwn </h4><br>  In our time, the level of development of rail transport has reached unprecedented heights.  High-speed trains literally fly across the expanses of the world, which virtually destroyed the distance between cities.  However, all these wonders would be impossible without computer systems that manage everything.  But they can be hacked! <br><br>  The Choo Choo Pwn competition will consist of several tasks during which participants will need to access the control system (APCS) model of the railway and container loading, exploiting the vulnerabilities of industrial protocols and bypassing the authentication of SCADA systems and industrial equipment web interfaces.  Contestants will gain access to the network of the automated process control system and its HMI components and within a given time will either have to disrupt the performance of individual parts of the railway layout or gain controlled access to the target systems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f41/754/a51/f41754a514db76e715ae87fef7d2d90f.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Labyrinth </h4><br>  What are the most exciting moments in robbery movies or fantastic action movies?  Surely they include frames in which the heroes break through to their goal through the most powerful security systems, miraculously avoiding cleverly placed traps.  In such moments, the heart beats more often, even with the audience in front of the screen.  Adrenaline rush is guaranteed and guests PHDays, because they can literally become the very heroes of Hollywood movies. <br><br>  In just one hour, the participants will have to overcome the laser field and motion sensors, open secret doors, clean the room from bugs, fight in an intellectual duel with artificial intelligence and defuse the bomb.  To pass the "Labyrinth", players will need the skills of digging in the garbage (dumpster diving), breaking locks, searching for vulnerabilities in applications, social engineering, as well as ingenuity and physical training. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/56a/444/ee9/56a444ee9d6d7862c68bce784a4fac2b.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Leave ATM Alone </h4><br>  During this competition, anyone can become a black hat and try their luck in finding and operating software vulnerabilities found in ATMs.  The competition will be held in two stages: first, the participants will look for and exploit vulnerabilities in the system deployed on this ATM, and in the second stage, the finalists will perform similar tasks in even more stringent time frames. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2c7/604/2f9/2c76042f9e06a05a0ef3ca8574233e23.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Attention!</b>  The software, which contains vulnerabilities and installed in a competitive ATM, was developed specifically for competitions during PHDays III and is not found in real life. <br><br>  In addition, this year ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/143364/">in contrast to the past</a> ) will be a cult contest Lockpicking.  Competitions and master classes on opening the locks will be held by Deviant Allam, Babak Javadi and Keith Howell - experts from the association The Open Organization Of Lockpickers (TOOOL).  All participants of the forum are waiting for new applied knowledge, interesting practical tasks and many opportunities to test their skills. <br><br><h4>  Online contests </h4><br>  For those who for some reason will not be able to appear in the Moscow International Trade Center during the days of the forum, there is an opportunity to join the competition online. <br><br><h5>  Hash runner </h5><br>  As part of this competition, participants' knowledge in the field of cryptographic hashing algorithms, as well as hacking functions of passwords, will be tested.  The competitors will be provided with a list of hash functions generated by various algorithms (MD5, SHA-1, Blowfish, GOST3411, etc.).  To win you need to score as many points as possible for a limited time, overtaking all competitors. <br><br>  Take part in the competition will be able to any user of the Internet.  Registration for participation will open on <a href="http://phdays.ru/">the</a> PHDays <a href="http://phdays.ru/">website</a> a week before the start of the forum. <br><br><h5>  Competitive intelligence </h5><br>  The competition will allow forum participants to find out how quickly and efficiently they are able to search for useful information on the Internet. <br><br>  On the contest page will be published questions related to a certain organization, information about which can be found on the Internet.  The task of the participant in the competition is to find as many correct answers to the questions as possible in the shortest time possible.  Results will be announced at the end of the second day of the forum. <br><br>  Any Internet user is allowed to compete.  You can register on <a href="http://phdays.ru/program/contests/">the</a> PHDays <a href="http://phdays.ru/program/contests/">website</a> (registration opens a week before the start of the forum). <br><br>  All winners and prize-winners of the competition will receive gifts from the organizers of Positive Hack Days, the company Positive Technologies.  To participate in most contests you need to bring a laptop.  The full list of competitions and their detailed description are posted on the website phdays.ru. <br><br><h5>  PHDays HackQuest </h5><br>  Organizer: @ <a href="http://onsec.ru/">ONsec_Lab</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://hackquest.phdays.com/">Competitors</a> will be able to immerse themselves in the almost forgotten world of DOS and 8-bit music, stir up their deepest nostalgic feelings and recharge yourself with positive emotions on the eve of the international forum PHDays III. <br><br>  Dates: from 1 to 13 May 2013. <br>  The winners will receive souvenirs and the opportunity to get free on PHDays III. <br><br>  Prizes: <br>  1st place: 5 tickets + 5 souvenir T-shirts <br>  2 place: 4 tickets + 4 T-shirts <br>  3rd place: 3 tickets + 3 T-shirts <br>  4-10 place: 1 ticket + 1 T-shirt <br><br>  Special prize for an additional bonus task - 1 ticket and 1 T-shirt. <br><br>  You can read descriptions of last year's contests in the PHDays blog: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://blog.phdays.ru/2012/07/phdays-2012-hash-runner.html">Hash runner</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://blog.phdays.ru/2012/06/h-phdays-2012.html">Big Ku $ h</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://blog.phdays.ru/2012/07/phdays_12.html">Big shot</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://blog.phdays.ru/2012/07/phdays-2012.html">Competitive intelligence</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://blog.phdays.ru/2012/07/blog-post.html">Box game</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://blog.phdays.ru/2012/07/positive-hack-days.html">2600</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://blog.phdays.ru/2012/06/phdays-online-hackquest-2012.html">Online hackquest</a> </li></ul><br>  + raitap from competitors: <br><br>  <a href="http://xanadrel.blogspot.fr/2012/06/phd-hash-runner-contest.html">http://xanadrel.blogspot.fr/2012/06/phd-hash-runner-contest.html</a> <br>  <a href="http://hashcat.net/forum/thread-1246.html">http://hashcat.net/forum/thread-1246.html</a> <br>  <a href="http://blog.rebz.net/2012/05/28/pre-hackquest-phdays-2012-kak-eto-bylo/">http://blog.rebz.net/2012/05/28/pre-hackquest-phdays-2012-kak-eto-bylo/</a> <br><br>  PS You can register for participation in the Positive Hack Days III forum <a href="http://phdays2013.runet-id.com/">at the following link</a> . <br><br>  PPS The full list of contests <a href="http://phdays.ru/program/contests/">is available</a> on the official forum site. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/178439/">https://habr.com/ru/post/178439/</a></p>
