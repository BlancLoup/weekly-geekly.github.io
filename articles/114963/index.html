  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Friendly interface or casualization: good or evil</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A certain number of years after the invention of the computer, when it was available only to a narrow circle of specialists, such a problem did not exist in principle.  Scientists and service personnel had a fairly clear idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow the ‚Äúbig calculator‚Äù worked, so that there was a need for a friendly and pleasant interface. <br>  Later, with the advent of the first PCs, designed, albeit not for mass distribution, but on the existence in a single room, more and more people began to gain access to the computer, far from "all this electronics" in general and devices of this particular unit in particular. <br>  The emergence of the first shells (first text, then graphic) gave rise to a whole industry aimed at the "friendliness" of programs.  Of course, this has generated a new wave of people who want to join the world of cars. <br>  And in recent years, with the mass distribution of cheap PCs that are accessible to almost anyone, the problem has become particularly acute: the children began to communicate to the computer of their parents, those on the fingers explained everything to grandparents ... And then the problem arose: a person, from a certain age, becomes pure it is physically hard to understand something new, with which before it did not even touch. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>Consider what brought us a similar influx of users in the virtual world:</i> <br><br>  <b>Pros:</b>

      - The interfaces have really become more convenient, most actions are performed according to the rule of three clicks: one or two, maximum three clicks are now enough to select one or another option. <br>  - A large audience attracts to the market of computer services more customers who want to solve their problems without leaving home, and therefore they will need their own "computer scientists" <br>  - More computers joined - more sales of firms engaged in "software" and "hardware". <br>  - A large number of users made possible the appearance of "phenomena" that are absolutely impossible in the real world - due to disunity, lack of organization or just laziness (Wikipedia, Habr, online conferences around the world) <br><br>  <b>Minuses:</b> <br><br>  - Friendly interface slowly but surely kills the profession of ‚Äúcomputer technician‚Äù - only programmers and hardware workers remain.  The need for administrators and similar classes over time may disappear. <br>  - A large number of users have finally turned the Internet into a large garbage heap - it is becoming increasingly difficult to find useful information, not because of its lack, but because of the Internet‚Äôs oversaturation with advertising, garbage and outdated information. <br>  - Many professional resources are forced to close from the external Internet, setting their own rules of access to the resource or providing entry only by invitation <br>  - The heyday of trolling: the Internet is slowly but surely becoming stupid, due to the decrease in the average age of users.  If earlier the average age of a person in the network was 20-30 years, now it is 15-18. <br>  - Fertile ground for the prosperity of piracy and copy-paste - it became impossible to track all information on the Internet physically, and the fact of "theft" is almost impossible to prove. <br><br>  From here, one can definitely draw some conclusions: the customization leading to a wide influx of users requires a certain return from the ‚Äúnetwork population‚Äù.  Perhaps there are not enough unspoken rules, perhaps you want to create a service that is seriously engaged in "garbage collection."  In addition, given the global influx of children, it will soon be necessary to set the minimum age of access to the network, since parents are not able to control them themselves: for example, personal chips of users that allow access only to content ‚Äúby age‚Äù can be used for this.  Some will say that the Internet is freedom, and its restriction will kill the Internet, but in my opinion in the lives of normal people not so much will change - it may be necessary to reconsider the policy of ‚Äúpiracy‚Äù, but in general, the Internet cleared of garbage will become itself friendly and understandable, and not a place where it‚Äôs scary to have a child or a girl. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/114963/">https://habr.com/ru/post/114963/</a></p>
