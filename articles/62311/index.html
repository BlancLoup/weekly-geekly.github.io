Well, where else can you play?  Not for the money.  Not proving your coolness to anyone?  Besides, at a convenient time only for you?  So the idea came to my mind to start organizing small themed open air parties in the open air.  This article will discuss how it all prepared and how it ended.  Perhaps someone in this blog will benefit from our unforgettable experience. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I began by searching for people who would need it and find it interesting.  Playing for people coming off is always more interesting.  It did not take long to search.  Some good acquaintances have been gathering in the street in the summer and dancing Latin American dances (salsa, merengue).  So the problem of a place, time and people was solved quickly. <br><br><h4>  Training </h4><br>  So, the place and time was chosen.  Chosen unsuccessfully from a technical point of view.  The organizers wanted to carry it out in their usual place where, as it turned out, there is not even an electrical outlet. <br><br>  I had a CD player and a mixing console at home ( <b>Pioneer CDJ 400</b> and <b>Pioneer DJM 400</b> ), so there was no additional cost.  It remained to find the acoustics and energy source. <br>  With acoustics, we figured out quickly.  We were quite satisfied with the 1 kW kW <a href="http://www.eurosound.ru/catalogue/default.htm%3Fi%3D0cba4644-f19b-497d-abea-ea4785d07cda">Eurosound</a> active acoustic kit from an expensive for its class of devices.  His only minus at the moment is that he fits into our car;).  Buying acoustics - it was the only thing that seriously hit the bill.

    <img src="http://img200.imageshack.us/img200/8025/openair2.gif" align="right">  With a source of energy, everything was more complicated.  There were two options.  Simple and versatile.  Simple - is to buy a car converter 12 \ 220 and powered by a cigarette lighter.  The second is to buy a <b>gasoline generator</b> .  As a result, we stopped at the second option, so to speak for the future and just in case.  Gasoline generator searched not long.  We bought an inexpensive, domestic and easy generator in <b>OBI</b> . <br><br><img src="http://img200.imageshack.us/img200/6039/openair3.gif" align="left">  On the way, we went to <b>IKEA</b> and bought a yellow folding table, which is assembled in 5 minutes.  You can conveniently put cd players, remote and laptop on it.  This is all that we managed to do in the first weekend.  By the way, an umbrella of such a large, beach or awning is clearly not enough;) <br><br><h4>  First start </h4><br>  The following weekend we went to test all this equipment.  We filled the generator with oil for chainsaws and 92nd gasoline.  Collected acoustics.  Began to check.  It‚Äôs our happiness that we didn‚Äôt plug all our equipment into a beautiful generator at once.  Measuring stress was a good idea.  We realized that with such differences we risk to burn everything to the ground.  We went to look for a voltage regulator.  The time was already late, and only UPSs were found on Gorbushka.  I had to take OPS on trial.  They stuck it in the generator and realized that they didn‚Äôt eat the UPS from the generator and that's it.  We went home to think a thought. <br><br><h4>  Second run </h4><br><img src="http://img194.imageshack.us/img194/6137/openair4.gif" align="right">  The second launch has already been organized in nature, as the weather allowed.  At this time, we also purchased Resant voltage regulator in Leroy Merlin.  Well, they collected all this stuff in the open air. <br><br>  A generator, an extension cord of 40 meters (so that it does not buzz above the ear), then a stabilizer, a pilot and all our equipment in it. <br><br>  The estimated <b>collection time is 15 minutes</b> along with the table and turntables. <br><br>  We found out that 2 liters of gasoline is enough for <b>3-4 hours of continuous play</b> . <br><br>  Glad.  If you charge the UPS, you can play another 20 minutes and freely tinker with the generator pouring gasoline and solving other technical problems.  The launch was considered successful, there was a week left before the party, but the kebab was of course overdone. <br><br><h4>  A party </h4><br>  Center of Moscow.  People are 30-40 people.  It's raining.  This is something we did not foresee.  The generator is sometimes gloh, the acoustics had to pull the packages.  The people are wet, happy and contented. <br><br>  Living practice is very good, but not easy.  This is very cool for those who do not want commerce, but want practice and celebration :) <br><br><img src="http://img194.imageshack.us/img194/6003/openair5.gif"><br><br>  While information on events can be found here: <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/ru_merengue/">community.livejournal.com/ru_merengue</a> <br><br>  So having spent a total of just a few days of your life and eating a month of Doshirak, you can make a party and do it more than once.  :) <br><br><h4>  Used equipment </h4><br>  ‚Ä¢ Gasoline generator.
