The professor asked. <br>  ‚ÄúYes, sir,‚Äù the student replied. <br><br>  The professor asked: <br>  - If God created everything, then God created evil, since it exists.  And according to the principle that our actions define ourselves, then God is evil.

      The student became quiet after hearing such an answer. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The professor was very pleased with himself.  He praised the students that he once again proved that faith in God is a myth. <br><br>  Another student raised his hand and said: <br>  - Can I ask you a question, professor? <br>  ‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù the professor answered. <br><br>  The student got up and asked <br>  - Professor, is there a cold? <br>  - What a question?  Of course it does.  Have you ever been cold? <br><br>  The students laughed at the question of the young man.  The young man replied: <br>  ‚ÄúActually, sir, there is no cold.‚Äù  In accordance with the laws of physics, what we consider to be cold is actually the absence of heat.  A person or object can be studied on whether it has or transmits energy.  Absolute zero (-460 degrees according to Faregate) is the complete absence of heat.  All matter becomes inert and unable to react at this temperature.  There is no cold.  We created this word to describe what we feel in the absence of heat. <br><br>  The student continued. <br>  ‚ÄúProfessor, is there darkness?‚Äù <br><br>  The professor replied: <br>  - Of course, there is. <br><br>  The student replied: <br>  You are wrong again, sir.  Darkness also does not exist.  Darkness is really the absence of light.  We can explore light, but not darkness.  We can use Newton's prism to spread white light into many colors and study different wavelengths of each color.  You cannot measure darkness.  A simple ray of light can break into the world of darkness and illuminate it.  How can you find out how dark any space is?  You measure how much light is presented.  Is not it?  Darkness is a concept that a person uses to describe what happens in the absence of light. <br><br>  In the end, the young man asked the professor: <br>  - Sir, evil exists? <br><br>  Uncertainly this time, the professor replied: <br>  - Of course, as I said.  We see him every day.  Cruelty between people set <br>  crime and violence around the world.  These examples are nothing but evil manifestations. <br><br>  To this the student replied: <br>  ‚ÄúEvil does not exist, sir, or at least he does not exist for himself.‚Äù  Evil is simply the absence of God.  It looks like darkness and cold - a word created by man to describe the absence of God.  God did not create evil.  Evil is not faith or love, which exist as light and heat.  Evil is the result of the absence of divine love in a person's heart.  It is the kind of cold that comes when there is no heat, or the kind of darkness that comes when there is no light. <br><br>  The professor sat down.  The name of the young student was Albert Einstein. <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/23598/">https://habr.com/ru/post/23598/</a></p>
