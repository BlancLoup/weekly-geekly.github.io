      About half a year ago I read the book by Robert Maurer ‚ÄúStep by Step towards Achieving the Goal‚Äù, about the kaizen method.  At some places skeptically hmykala, on others understandably assented, on the third she yelled: ‚ÄúOh, what nonsense!‚Äù. <br>  The essence of the method: go to the goal in small steps.  And specifically small ones: marching for 1 minute a day in front of the TV, break off one chocolate bar and throw it out, spread only one product out of the cart, discard one cigarette per day, and so on. <br><br>  People usually solve their problems either like me, in sharp jerks (the innovation method), or slowly but systematically (the kaizen method).  All these pictures with deadlines, jokes about students and a session or about the fact that only guests motivate a quick cleaning just illustrate the first method. <br><br>  By accessing <a href="https://smartprogress.do/">SmartProgress</a> , I watch people go towards their goal.  And I see the undoubted advantage of the kaizen method.  Going to the goal with gradual regular steps is not as difficult as suddenly starting to run 10 laps around the stadium or learn 50 new words in Italian in one day. <br><br>  <b>About Kaizen Method</b> <br><br>  The success and advantage of the method lies in psychology. <br>  Making small steps does not block the cerebral cortex, and it creates a sort of software for the desired change, creating new neural connections and new habits.  We stop resisting change and get involved in a new business, moving faster towards our goal. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f39/a95/2ef/f39a952ef95244cb9fa84de0395dfa97.jpg"><br>  Imagine two people.  One decided to read every day 5 pages of a useful book (for example, ‚ÄúStep by Step towards Goal Achievement‚Äù by Robert Maurer).  The second grinned: ‚ÄúFive pages?  Well this is about nothing!  I will easily get together and read this book for a couple of days!  Tomorrow I'll start, but today there is no time. " <br>  Guess what the final result will be in a month?  I would like to believe that the second person will keep his word and allow time for self-development, but most often small steps lead to a result, and such ‚Äúheroic jerks‚Äù leave us in place. <br><br>  <b>What does the kaizen method consist of</b> <br><br>  It includes 6 strategies. <br>  1. Ask small questions. <br>  2. Think small thoughts. <br>  3. Perform small actions. <br>  4. Solve small problems. <br>  5. Notice little moments. <br>  6. Distribute small rewards. <br><br>  <b><i>Strategy number 1.</i></b>  <b><i>Ask small questions</i> .</b> <br><br>  "Small" - means the most specific.  Not ‚ÄúHow to make our company the best?‚Äù, But ‚ÄúOffer one small step to increase sales.‚Äù <br>  The human brain is afraid of global issues, but it answers quite concretely to concrete ones.  Check for yourself.  Which question is easier for you to answer: ‚ÄúHow to lose weight in six months?‚Äù Or ‚ÄúWhat can I do today to lose weight?‚Äù.  Specific questions lead us to action. <br><br>  <i>Kaizen Reception</i> <br><br>  Ask small questions, perhaps even a few times.  For example, by asking the question ‚ÄúWhat can I do today to start growing as a professional?‚Äù, You can come up with different answers: <br>  ‚Ä¢ "Read books"; <br>  ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúAttend trainings‚Äù; <br>  ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúWatch for successful people.‚Äù <br>  We need as small as possible, but a clear answer like ‚ÄúCreate a list of books for professional growth.‚Äù <br><br>  <b><i>Strategy number 2.</i></b>  <b><i>Think small thoughts</i></b> <br><br>  The essence of the strategy is the use of the reception of mental sculpture.  Imagine in all details how you perform a certain action (speak to the public, call a nervous client, or go to the boss "on the carpet"). <br><br>  <i>Kaizen Reception</i> <br><br>  Imagine yourself performing an important task, just 15 seconds a day (small action) - as the author recommends.  Stay comfortably in a quiet place, imagine that you are in the right situation.  And now look at everything that happens from the side: how people look, what their facial expressions look like, how they nod approvingly.  Using mental sculpture, imagine everything down to the smallest detail: smell, color, sound, air temperature. <br>  After you master this technique in a positive way, work through it in a negative way, presenting the most disgusting scenario.  And after completing all these stages, feeling that you are ready to begin the difficult task, take the next small step, for example, speak just before one listener. <br><br>  <b><i>Strategy number 3.</i></b>  <b><i>Do small things</i></b> <br><br>  This is the core of kaizen philosophy.  Small steps sometimes seem ridiculous and useless, but it really works, folks! <br>  Small success stimulates to perform more complex tasks.  I, like that person from the example above, do not want to read 5 pages per day.  My attention is scattered, I do not remember what I read yesterday, I have to enter the topic for a long time.  It's easier for me to sit at 8 pm for a book and put it off at 4 in the morning.  But, after reading ‚ÄúStep by Step towards Achieving the Goal,‚Äù and a little bit without disrupting one project because of my approach to business, I think: ‚ÄúLet me try, I don‚Äôt lose anything.‚Äù <br><br>  <i>Kaizen reception from my experience</i> <br><br>  Set a goal to write an article.  I determined that I needed to write 1000 characters per day (about ¬Ω A4 paper), left time for editing and subtraction.  In total, I needed 4 days.  I did it in two. <br>  This strategy reminds me of the ‚Äú <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/smartprogress/blog/166681/">Eat the elephant bit by bit</a> ‚Äù method, but for some reason the book inspired me to use this approach .. <br><br>  Starting from the small, we will achieve more than if we don‚Äôt do anything at all or wait for the New Year to give ourselves another promise to go in for sports. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/296/627/e5a/296627e5a05e462587f3bb85dd9f5fc1.jpg"><br><br>  <b><i>Strategy ‚Ññ4.</i></b>  <b><i>Solve small problems</i></b> <br><br>  Take a look around, find the little things that annoy you and deal with them.  Otherwise, these little things will come together and an avalanche of heavy consequences of ignoring minor problems will cover you. <br>  The author describes how Toyota implemented the kaizen method in its work.  If the worker saw a marriage on the conveyor, he could pull the cord and the container would stop to correct the defect in the part.  It would seem a trifle, and even absurd: well, anyone who wants it, can influence the work of the conveyor! <br>  But this decision allowed Toyota to maintain its reputation as a manufacturer of high-quality cars.  But competitors, neglecting the correction of trifles, suffered losses. <br><br>  <i>Kaizen Reception</i> <br><br>  Recall your serious mistakes and consider whether there were any warning signals.  What could you do differently? <br>  Think of your goal.  What little mistake did you make today?  Are there any little things that annoy you, but you have no time to eliminate them?  How can you deal with them right now? <br><br>  <b><i>Strategy # 5. Hand out small awards</i></b> <br><br>  Encourage yourself by creating inner motivation.  And the reward should be small, often symbolic.  Psychologists believe that a high amount of reward hampers self-improvement, forcing a person to work for reward. <br>  How can you reward yourself for success in accomplishing your goal? <br><br>  <i>Kaizen Reception</i> <br><br>  The award must be: <br>  ‚Ä¢ adequate to the goal.  If you walked a distance of 500 meters, you should not arrange a grand celebration in your honor. <br>  ‚Ä¢ adequate to man.  Consider the individual characteristics of the person you want to reward or encourage.  One is more pleasant than a simple ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù; another needs a more detailed compliment. <br><br>  <b><i>Strategy ‚Ññ6.</i></b>  <b><i>Identify little moments</i></b> <br><br>  Be observant.  Any trifle can be the primary source of a brilliant solution.  For example, an engineer who walked with his dog drew attention to the pristepuyuschy burdock and invented the velcro. <br><br>  <i>Kaizen Reception</i> <br>  Show curiosity and be open to everything new.  Talk to people who hold a different point of view to see why they hold this view. <br><br>  <b>Kaizen in my interpretation</b> <br><br>  Incorrectly applying the kaizen method, one may be exposed to the following danger: overly reliance on small actions, and therefore never start doing something more global. <br>  I use kaizen mainly for working (if it is unpleasant to me).  I noticed - even just looking at the sites on the desired topic several times a day, I already tune in to the task.  Thoughts and associations appear, the skeleton of the article gradually forms. <br>  Then I make a plan.  And here kaizen is powerless against my desire to solve everything with the method of innovation)) But I try to break the task down into small stages and work on it systematically. <br>  Now I am working on one large project, according to which I need to issue 5,000 characters daily, clean, without prior work.  And if suddenly I could not make this volume, I still open the document and write as much as I can. <br><br>  In my opinion, SmartProgress and the kaizen method work fine in one harness and here's why: <br>  1. Ability to keep a diary.  It is easy to break the <a href="https://smartprogress.do/">achievement of the goal</a> into the smallest stages and clearly demonstrate the passage of each. <br>  2. Each item of the plan during the achievement of the goal can be commented.  And do not forget to please yourself with small awards. <br>  3. Small problems are easier to notice and eliminate, because your plan is in front of you.  And if you do not know how to eliminate - ask your friends. <br>  4. Working together with like-minded people (if the goal is created in a group), you may notice interesting moments in achieving the goals of other people, for example, what resources they use and how you can apply them in your situation. <br>  The kaizen method helps to overcome the fear of a new, unpleasant or especially large task and tune in to its effective solution.  Try it, you really have nothing to lose! <br> <a href="https://smartprogress.do/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d4d/4c2/ee3/d4d4c2ee30bb4d119da5af05fbc32e01.jpg"><br></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300288/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300288/</a></p>
