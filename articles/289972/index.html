  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Interview with Sourceforge.net‚Äôs month project team - GNS3</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I hope everyone knows about sourceforge?  If someone does not know, then <a href="http://sourceforge.net/">sourceforge.net</a> is perhaps one of the most famous platforms for opensource development and distribution.  Besides the fact that I always look for the programs I need there in the first place, I frankly like this community.  The team maintains a blog on its platform, and sometimes there are curious posts there.  One of which I bring to your attention. <br><br>  In April, the <a href="http://www.gns3.com/">GNS3</a> package was selected as the project of the month.  It is a graphical network simulator that allows you to design complex network topologies.  The GNS3 team shared their thoughts on the project's history, goals, and direction of development. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  SF: What made you get started? </h4><br><blockquote>  Jeremy (Jeremy Grossmann), the creator and CTO, originally came up with the idea for his university graduation project.  He was looking for a platform that could be used to easily learn and get through network certification, but could not find one.  Then he made it himself. </blockquote><br><h4>  SF: And what is the original goal achieved? </h4><br><blockquote>  Yes, and even more.  It all started with the creation of a simple training utility, and is now used to build networks by Fortune 500 companies. </blockquote><br><h4>  SF: Who can use your project to a greater extent? </h4><br><blockquote>  Network specialists, and those who are going to become them soon.  In general, to all those who are looking for the best ways to build and test computer networks. </blockquote><br><h4>  SF: Is there really such a need for this graphical simulator? </h4><br><blockquote>  Building networks is an expensive and time consuming task.  GNS3 reduces costs by 90% and reduces time costs by more than 30%. </blockquote><br><h4>  SF: What is the best way to get the most out of using GNS3? </h4><br><blockquote>  Go to <a href="https://community.gns3.com/welcome">The Jungle</a> and learn from GNS3 experts.  Get your hands on lab assignments, read the documentation and start playing with the software. </blockquote><br><h4>  SF: What did your team do to build and develop a community? </h4><br><blockquote>  So in order: <br><ul><li>  Created a cool software. </li><li>  Provided a place for communication and exchange of information between users. </li><li>  Used community feedback to improve software. </li><li>  Repeat. </li></ul></blockquote><br><h4>  SF: Do you think more frequent releases help build a user community? </h4><br><blockquote>  Over the past year we have made releases for more than the previous 6 years.  The quality of releases is more important than their quantity, but quick error correction is crucial. </blockquote><br><h4>  SF: When did you consider your project shot for the first time? </h4><br><blockquote>  In 2011, our project began an unexpected takeoff for us.  At that time, large network vendors such as Huawei, Cisco, HP, and Juniper began to release their own products with similar functionality.  This allowed us to integrate the systems developed by them, which was impossible before. </blockquote><br><h4>  SF: How did this happen? </h4><br><blockquote>  Seeing the success of the project, large companies paid attention to this and wished to participate in it.  In addition, their customers used our software. </blockquote><br><h4>  SF: What is the end result of this event? </h4><br><blockquote>  Our package summarizes parts of other people's development, because we have the ability to integrate into the platform. </blockquote><br><h4>  SF: What next? </h4><br><blockquote>  Upgrade the platform to an all-in-one state (take it anywhere, put it anywhere, use it anywhere). </blockquote><br><h4>  SF: And when will this happen? </h4><br><blockquote>  The work is already in full swing, there are working prototypes, so there will be a release within a year. </blockquote><br><h4>  SF: Do you have the resources you need for this? </h4><br><blockquote>  Yes, big partners will help us. </blockquote><br><h4>  SF: If you had the opportunity to start over, what would you do differently for GNS3? </h4><br><blockquote>  We are doing this seriously from the very beginning.  But until 2014, we did not know that we were doing something special in the software and the community.  If we began to take seriously all that we know and can do now in 2011, who knows where we would be now. </blockquote><br><h4>  SF: Why? </h4><br><blockquote>  If we immediately paid close attention to user reviews. </blockquote><br><h4>  SF: Are there any reasons why you can't do it right now? </h4><br><blockquote>  SF: We can.  We have a full-time development team and infrastructure support.  We push this project very high quality. </blockquote><br><br>  Thank you all for your attention! </div>
