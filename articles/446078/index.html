      We discussed the differences between different devices and told us what is important to pay attention to when purchasing speakers.  We also managed to debunk a few myths and talk about trends in the Hi-Fi industry. <br><br>  Next, consider some of the most significant topics. <br><br><h2>  About myths </h2><br>  The first release of the podcast [ <a href="http://www.vigorousspace.co/zvoook/00001">listen</a> , <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/audiomania/blog/365455/">read</a> ] dealt with the misconceptions associated with portable and stationary audio systems.  One of the most common myths says that small in-ear headphones produce bass worse than overhead. <br><br>  In fact, the low frequency transmission does not depend on the size of the ear cushions, and some of the ‚Äúplugs‚Äù are comparable in power to the bass with large headphones.  The main reason for the "loss" of low frequencies - poor insulation.  Therefore, it is important to pay attention to interchangeable headphone attachments - if they do not fit in size, the sound may not seem good enough to you. <br><br>  Another misconception that we talked about in the first issue is the use of ‚Äúwrong‚Äù materials for the production of columns.  Ostensibly acoustics from glass or metal sounds worse than from wood.  It is believed that in "unconventional" materials there is an excessive amount of resonances and vibrations that distort the sound. <br><br>  This opinion is associated with an erroneous view of the column case as a simple ‚Äúbox‚Äù that supports the speakers.  In reality, the body is a complex system that is designed specifically for specific loudspeakers and their features.  For this reason, the material in the design of the column does not play as much a role as the experience of the engineers involved in it. <br><br>  In the third episode [ <a href="http://www.vigorousspace.co/zvoook/00003">to listen</a> , to <a href="https://habr.com/en/company/audiomania/blog/365683/">read</a> ] we have refuted the opinion that professional audio equipment is more expensive than home audio.  Misconception associated with confusion in terms of "home" and "professional."  They do not mean that the second sounds better than the first, ‚Äúamateur‚Äù technique. <br><br><blockquote>  In the case of professional equipment, other tasks are expected from such acoustics a neutral and ‚Äúunemotional‚Äù sound, which is suitable for any institution (restaurant or cafe).  Therefore, systems for events are not suitable for home, and you should not compare these segments with each other. </blockquote><br>  In the <a href="https://habr.com/en/company/audiomania/blog/381227/">fourth</a> and <a href="https://habr.com/en/company/audiomania/blog/384473/">thirteenth</a> editions, we talked about misconceptions related to home theaters.  The first is the desire to install as many speakers as possible in the living room.  In practice, the optimal number of speakers for a home theater depends on the size of the room.  In most cases, it is enough to have a system of four speakers without a subwoofer or 5.1 acoustics. <br><br>  We talked about several other myths in the following podcast releases: <br><br><ul><li>  The 2nd edition [ <a href="http://www.vigorousspace.co/zvoook/00002">listen</a> , <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/audiomania/blog/379247/">read</a> ] is devoted to digital-to-analog converters - in it we also discussed the myths associated with headphones and professional audio equipment. </li><li>  In the 5th issue of [ <a href="http://www.vigorousspace.co/zvoook/00005">listen</a> , <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/audiomania/blog/381177/">read</a> ] we have refuted the misconceptions about reproducing bass. </li><li>  The 7th edition [ <a href="http://www.vigorousspace.co/zvoook/00007">to listen</a> , <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/audiomania/blog/382383/">read</a> ] tells why when choosing acoustics one should not trust only technical characteristics and graphics. </li></ul><br><h2>  Meet with experts </h2><br>  A frequent guest of our podcast was design engineer, sound producer and entrepreneur Yuri Stanislavovich Fomin.  In one of the issues [ <a href="http://www.vigorousspace.co/zvoook/00022">listen to</a> ] he told how amateurs can create their own acoustics.  In his opinion, ready-made column schemes and DIY kits will be a win-win option.  We talked more about these kits in another issue of the podcast [ <a href="http://www.vigorousspace.co/zvoook/00042">listen</a> , <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/audiomania/blog/406011/">read</a> ].  He also shared his knowledge of how the product circuit is developed: how much time and money it takes, and what exactly the acoustics engineers do. <br><br>  In addition to Yuri Fomin, Artem Faermark, founder and CEO of Audiomania, is on the list of invited experts.  In the twentieth [ <a href="http://www.vigorousspace.co/zvoook/00020">listen</a> , <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/audiomania/blog/374889/">read</a> ] and thirty-fourth [ <a href="http://www.vigorousspace.co/zvoook/00034">listen</a> , <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/audiomania/blog/396585/">read</a> ] releases, he told about the history of creation and features of the production of the company's own brands. <br><br>  In one of the issues we communicated with sound engineer Evgeny Pereyaslavtsev.  With him, we discussed the process of audio of films.  Eugene spoke about one of the unusual aspects of his work - the creation of sounds that do not exist in nature.  On one of the projects, he had to synthesize the sound of suddenly growing vines from the ground - it was generated from the sound of flowing water, grilling scrambled eggs and the rustle of paper. <br><br>  Other issues with invited experts: <br><br><ul><li>  Anatoly Dmitrievich Arsenov, an engineer at F-Lab, was the guest of the tenth episode of ‚ÄúSound‚Äù [ <a href="http://www.vigorousspace.co/zvoook/00010">listen</a> , <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/audiomania/blog/383321/">read</a> ].  In the podcast, he spoke about the history of the emergence of digital formats and the principles of audio compression. </li><li>  In the twenty-fourth ( <a href="http://www.vigorousspace.co/zvoook/00024">listen to</a> ) release, Aleksey Shubin, a specialist in Hi-Fi and Hi-End equipment, participated.  We discussed the audio formats - FLAC, MP3, DSF - and video, talked about 4K movies and why home theater films should be better watched without dubbing. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bu/ml/3a/buml3amiqrap8zgbqem-wahmiam.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>Photo: large cinema in the office of "Audiomania"</i></font> <br><br><h2>  About projects "Audiomania" </h2><br>  Some of the podcast episodes are about Audiomania installations.  In the twelfth issue of [ <a href="http://www.vigorousspace.co/zvoook/00012">listen</a> , <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/audiomania/blog/384283/">read</a> ] we talked about our own experience of installing audio systems and the difficulties that arise.  We also gave some tips to help you get the best possible sound. <br><br>  One of them is to consider, if possible, the placement of the audio system at the planning stage for the interior of the house with an installation specialist.  The expert will take into account nuances that the designer may not think about, for example, the placement of wires for acoustics or the cooling of equipment during operation. <br><br>  In another episode [ <a href="http://www.vigorousspace.co/zvoook/00039">to listen</a> , to <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/audiomania/blog/400671/">read</a> ] we talked about how two cinema halls were created in the showrooms of the Audiomania office.  The first of them is a ‚Äúroom in a room‚Äù design - a sound-absorbing multi-layer modular design that is not tied to the walls and ceiling of the original office space.  This isolates the room from noise and solves the problem of acoustic treatment.  We recorded one of the podcasts in this showroom: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DgQwh5KmQcE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The second hall is intended for the demonstration of "invisible" columns Cerasonar.  They are invisible in the interior, but they are not inferior in sound quality to standard systems - the acoustics support the effects of Dolby Atmos and include embedded subwoofers. <br><br>  Issues on projects "Audiomania": <br><br><ul><li>  The forty first edition of [ <a href="http://www.vigorousspace.co/zvoook/00041">listen</a> , <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/audiomania/blog/405297/">read</a> ] is devoted to the results of the work on cinema halls - in it we discussed the process of their design and the impression of the result. </li></ul><br><h2>  About vinyl </h2><br>  We talked about vinyl.  Two episodes of the podcast ‚ÄúSound‚Äù are completely devoted to the records and their place in modern times.  In the eighteenth issue of [ <a href="http://www.vigorousspace.co/zvoook/00018">listen</a> ] we discussed turntables - how much they cost, how to choose them and how to tune the ‚Äúturntable‚Äù.  In the release, the difference between the MC and the MM-pickup heads was explained in simple terms: the former are distinguished by greater sound detail, and the latter by higher volume. <br><br>  In the thirty-fifth episode [ <a href="http://www.vigorousspace.co/zvoook/00035">listen</a> , <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/audiomania/blog/396887/">read</a> ] we discussed the purchase of records and care for players.  In the issue you will find information about accessories for maintenance of the "turntables" and vinyl - devices for washing plates, brushes and antistatic envelopes. <br><br><hr><br>  <i>Additional reading from our blog:</i> <i><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1o/sf/72/1osf72wkwrjhzpl2bwl5hcmwnbq.png"></i>  <i><a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-4815.html">Myths and reality: what you need to know about modern audio systems</a></i> <i><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1o/sf/72/1osf72wkwrjhzpl2bwl5hcmwnbq.png"></i>  <i><a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-4817.html">Headphones with bass: the benefits and harm of low frequencies</a></i> <i><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1o/sf/72/1osf72wkwrjhzpl2bwl5hcmwnbq.png"></i>  <i><a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-5226.html">When you need a subwoofer</a></i> <i><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1o/sf/72/1osf72wkwrjhzpl2bwl5hcmwnbq.png"></i>  <i><a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-4958.html">How to choose the right speaker system</a></i> <i><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png"></i>  <i><a href="https://t.me/audiomaniaRU/720">A method of sound insulation, quenching up to 94% noise</a></i> <i><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png"></i>  <i><a href="https://t.me/audiomaniaRU/714">Vinyl is back and it's different</a></i> <br><hr></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/446078/">https://habr.com/ru/post/446078/</a></p>
