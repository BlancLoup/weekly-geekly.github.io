  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The saga of the "great and terrible" Quality Service Yandex.Market</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  If you open an online store, you probably want to add it to Yandex.Market.  After carefully reading the rules and following a lot of instructions, you can theoretically expect approval of the application.  But not always!  Even if you did everything right and did not break a single rule! <br><br>  The Quality Service (UK) may have an opinion about your store.  Nobody will justify it to you.  They simply say, ‚ÄúYour store is a duplicate storefront of sites ....‚Äù And it does not matter that these are competitors' sites, and that nothing binds you to them.  In the UK just decided that your site is another clone of some of the competitors. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  "How so?!  I am an independent shop! ‚Äù, - you are indignant. <br>  "The verification criteria were not disclosed!" - the UK will respond and will offer to write an official letter (on letterhead, stamped), with your arguments. <br><br>  Naively believing that the letter will solve the problem, you will spend 30-60 minutes of working time on a detailed description of the facts confirming your incoherence with these sites.  Attach scans of documents confirming the real existence of your company.  Even invite me to your place so that Yandex.Market employees can make sure that you are not physically located where the competitors are.

      The answer will be simple: ‚ÄúWe re-tested.  Your store is a duplicate storefront of sites .... ‚ÄùThe criteria for verification were not disclosed.  The names of the verifiers are not called. <br><br>  It remains only to call and explain that they are wrong.  That the criteria for verification is not all perfect.  What you need to change something.  Unfortunately, the bio-robot will answer you on the phone (I call people from the support service who can only say and do what is in the instructions).  A question or request, not described in the instructions, will lead to a short hanging of the bio-robot, and the final answer ‚ÄúAccess denied!‚Äù. <br><br>  What you do next is a mystery to me.  For example, I wrote this article.  Can someone from the habr users (including Yandex employees) tell me what other arguments should I give for the SK to finally believe me? <br><br>  <b>Here are the arguments that are NOT sufficient:</b> <br><ul><li>  I have an independent organization (seal + certificates attached) </li><li>  I am physically located at a different address. </li><li>  I have other phones, some of them are registered at the address indicated (MGTS number, not mobile, not virtual) </li><li>  The range of my store is different from the range of competitors by the most important positions </li><li>  I have other prices (even for the same goods) </li><li>  The main manufacturers and suppliers know me (company names and contacts are attached) </li><li>  I agree that the site of competitors will be removed from Market and left only mine (if we are one person, then why should I)? </li><li>  And finally, six months ago, my site already participated in the Market, was checked by the SC and approved, then there were no questions. </li></ul><br>  <b>Tell me, in the end, what more proof is needed?</b>  <b>Give no problems!</b> <br><br>  PS: <br>  In general, the UK is a very useful service, it monitors the fairness of competition.  Checks the availability of goods from sellers, the relevance of prices, the quality of the store, etc. Previously, a complete mess was going on without it: in order to receive a call, sellers laid out a non-existent product, put up low prices, etc. <br><br>  <i>But it seems that everywhere in Russia it‚Äôs like this: worse than the lawbreakers, only their overseers can be.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/91788/">https://habr.com/ru/post/91788/</a></p>
