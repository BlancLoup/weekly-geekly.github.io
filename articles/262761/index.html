The most advanced, naturally, servers of the 300th series.  These are the most advanced dual-processor servers, built on the latest generation of Intel Xeon Processor E5-2600 v3 processors.  Versatile and reliable machines that can work with a wide range of applications, such as databases, high performance computing, infrastructure tasks and virtualization tasks.  You can install any processor in these servers: from the youngest E5-2603v3 to E5-2699v3, you can place up to 24 memory modules, and since these are still older dual-processor models, they are ready to withstand a more serious load than or web server.  Note that HP ProLiant servers are available in two configurations: in the form of blade servers and conventional outdoor ones.  While providing a similar level of performance, solutions on Blade servers allow to place more equipment in the telecommunications cabinet due to higher density of server installation per 1U of occupied space, as well as integration of LAN and SAN switching equipment inside the Blade chassis itself. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  - <i><b>At the expense of what technologies has its productivity been improved in comparison with earlier models?</b></i>

      New Intel Xeon E5 2600v3 processors can increase performance in some tests up to 70% and increase efficiency by 36% compared to servers of the Gen8 line, which use previous generation Intel processors.  The HP DDR4 SmartMemory memory used in ninth-generation servers, with a capacity of up to 1.5 TB per server, is consistent with the performance of the new Intel processors.  For example, DDR4 memory, unlike DDR3, does not reduce its frequency even if 3 DIMM modules are connected to the memory bus channel.  This gives the customer maximum performance even on large amounts of memory.  But even with small amounts of DDR4 memory, DDR3 is faster by 14% due to a higher clock frequency - 2133 MHz against 1866 MHz.  Also, the performance of SmartArray controllers, data transfer speeds, the functionality of network adapters, etc. were increased.  Thus, improvements are noticeable in all key areas, and this gives a significant performance increase compared to the previous generation of servers. <br><br>  - <i><b>Users note the high energy efficiency of these solutions.</b></i>  <i><b>How is it achieved?</b></i> <br><br>  Efficiency is achieved through several technological improvements.  First of all, the new Intel Xeon processors for the same consumed electrical power now give out more performance due to a more compact technical process and a larger number of cores on the same chip area.  Also, the working voltage is reduced by 17% in the memory of the new generation - in systems with large amounts of memory, the savings in energy consumption are clearly visible.  HP power supplies have also become more efficient - their efficiency has increased to 96%. <br><br>  - <i><b>Is the server difficult to configure?</b></i> <br><br>  HP servers are considered to be the best in terms of ease of configuration and management.  Equipment configuration is often understood as the deployment of an operating system and applications on a server.  Those who have been using HP server products for a long time remember a special tool called Smart Start, which was delivered in the form of a CD or DVD and allowed for setting up the hardware and installing the OS on the server using a simple interface.  Users, answering asked questions and entering some parameters, got the opportunity to fully configure the server without going to the manufacturer‚Äôs and operating system sites to search for, for example, any drivers for the installed hardware.  Today, this great tool has been replaced by an even more advanced HP Intelligent Provisioning.  Its functionality is integrated into the server and allows you to start and configure the server, as well as automatically update the driver versions of the installed hardware.  The convenience of monitoring and managing servers is provided by the HP OneView and HP Insight Control tools, which greatly facilitate this process.  With their help, it is convenient to manage both a single server and a group, and the entire data center. <br><br>  - <i><b>Is it possible to change the equipment?</b></i>  <i><b>Are there any standard recommendations for pickings?</b></i> <br><br>  HP ProLiant servers come in two versions.  The first one is the most popular configurations of server models that are delivered as ready-made basic configurations, with a certain vendor number of pre-installed processors, memory modules and an I / O system.  The second is the so-called STO (Configure-to-order) configuration.  In this case, according to the requirements of a partner or customer, a unique server configuration is assembled at the factory, due to which flexibility is achieved in the ability to tune server performance for tasks that this equipment will solve.  The possibility of upgrading systems, of course, exists.  All the necessary options are available as separate products, which include including the independent installation of components into the server by a partner or customer.  HP also has convenient online tools like HP Product Bulletin and iQuote.  With their help, IT professionals can find all the necessary information about HP products and even independently choose compatible options for a specific server model. The role of HP servers in today's market <br><br>  When we talk about HP ProLiant servers, we are talking about a very popular product.  This is confirmed by figures from IDC analytics reports - according to the quarterly IDC Server Tracker, server sales from HP for 19 years are higher than those of competitors.  This data is confirmed by the press: PC Magazine / Russian Edition and Bestsellers of the IT Market magazines named HP ProLiant servers the best in their final reviews for 2014.  A CRN magazine survey of resellers and system integrators in Russia revealed that HP had outpaced other manufacturers in the market in a number of indicators.  Analysts from Gartner in their report ‚ÄúThe Magic Quadrant for Modular Servers‚Äù, released in May 2015, called HP the market leader in terms of the completeness of vision of tasks and market problems and the ability to solve these problems with their products. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a6c/7fb/716/a6c7fb7167f2b2d82471dbbee55a8014.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/262761/">https://habr.com/ru/post/262761/</a></p>
