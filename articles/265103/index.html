The book consists of two parts: the first describes the possibilities and shortcomings of OOP, the second part describes 23 classic design patterns.  The examples given in the book are written in the programming languages ‚Äã‚ÄãC ++ and Smalltalk. <br><br>  The "gang" outlines the principles for using design patterns and lists their catalogs.  The book demonstrates the role of patterns in creating the architecture of complex systems and shows how, through the use of the patterns contained in the reference book, a designer can develop his own applications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fca/62b/02d/fca62b02d5c749b78936a317a4767109.png"><br><br>  Book: <b>Refactoring Using Templates</b> <br>  Posted by: Joshua Kerievski <br><br>  Joshua Kerievski founded <a href="http://www.industriallogic.com/">Industrial Logic</a> , but we are better known as the author of the book, accumulating the experience of a professional developer in the use of design patterns. <br><br>  Kerievski teaches to avoid both insufficient and redundant design, strive to constantly analyze the performance of the code, simplify its understanding and maintenance.  Based on both his own and other people's experience, the author examines in detail the various features of the code that requires refactoring, describes which refactoring is best suited for a given situation, and describes its mechanics.  The book presents 27 complex refactorings. <br><br>  Kirievski refers to Fowler‚Äôs book Refactoring.  Improvement of the existing code ‚Äù, therefore, for a deeper understanding of the ways of introducing‚Äú Refactoring using templates ‚Äùpatterns into the program architecture, it is recommended to read them later.  You do not need additional knowledge, and although all are given in Java, they do not use the complex features of the language.  The book will be useful as a middle-level programmers, as well as professionals. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f9c/ae2/b93/f9cae2b9345749d89454fa64fb800f3d.jpg"><br><br>  Book: <b>‚ÄúC ++ Programming Language.</b>  <b>Introductory Course</b> <br>  Authors: Stanley B. Lippman, Josie Lajoye, Barbara Mu <br><br>  Stanley B. Lippmann worked with Bjorn Stroustrup at Bell Lab research corporation in the early stages of developing C ++.  In 2001, Stanley Lippman became the chief architect of Visual C ++ at Microsoft.  He also worked at Emergent Game Technologies, NASA, Pixar and 2kQubits. <br><br>  Josy Lajoye participated in the work on the C ++ compiler in IBM Canada, and also led the working group of the basic C ++ language in the international organization for standardization ANSI / ISO. <br><br>  Barbara Mu has nearly 30 years of programming experience.  For 15 years she worked at AT &amp; T, collaborated with Bjorn Stroustrup, and for several years led the C ++ development team. <br><br>  The book of these experts is clearly not limited to the dry subtitle of "introductory course", but is an exhaustive guide for learning the language.  The book covers both the basics of the structure of C ++ programs, including the use of preprocessor commands and header files, as well as more complex constructs (exceptions, classes, function and class templates, operator overloading, multiple inheritance, etc.). <br><br>  As C ++ develops, the book makes the appropriate changes.  In addition to the fundamental concepts, the new version of the book contains the most effective techniques that allow the reader to create their own programs even before in-depth familiarity with the features of the language. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/83c/1c6/10b/83c1c610bdcc489db13c08d2b7176ff5.jpg"><br><br>  Book: <b>‚ÄúSTL.</b>  <b>Pocket Guide ¬ª</b> <br>  By: Ray Lishner <br><br>  Ray Lishner is primarily known in Delphi-community as the author of the books Secrets of Delphi 2, Hidden Paths of Delphi 3 and many articles for such magazines as Delphi Informant, Dr.  Dobb's Journal.
