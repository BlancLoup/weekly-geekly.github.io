  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Start-up - job search abroad for IT specialists</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Earlier, I wrote <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/10348/">an article</a> about my experience of finding a job abroad.  In the same place, I mentioned agents about employment, with whom I worked and who often asked me if I knew intelligent programmers who just needed to work abroad.  Then I suggested to all readers of the above article that if someone is interested, I can link them with agents. <br><br>  On the same day, I received 18 private messages with a request to drop contact agents. <br><br>  In this article I will tell you how it all happened and what it led to me.  The article will be useful to those who have seriously thought about finding work abroad (the reasons do not matter), as well as for those who doubt it or have not yet thought on this topic.

      I believe that a number of readers now rightly had a question, is this service not an attempt to make a second Monster or LinkedIn.  I also asked this question and it was important for me to identify the differences in order to decide whether to develop this idea. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I received the answer to this question soon after the launch of the beta version.  If the first day received 18 applications, then over the next few days there were about 40 applications.  In total, during the time when the project was heard, I received 84 applications. <br><br>  I didn‚Äôt take any concrete actions to promote the project and after 3-4 weeks weeks the applications stopped coming. <br><br>  But I already had enough food to digest.  Among the authors of the applications were programmers, PM, QA specialists and designers.  Processing such a large number of applications was not an easy task.  It was necessary for everyone to find out the desired position and the main technologies that they own.  Then wait for answers, find out which agent is best to refer the candidate to, etc.  And this I have not taken a resume and did not check the level of knowledge of languages.  I was only convinced that the intentions are serious and the candidate understands the need for knowledge of English at a sufficient level and then recommended the candidate to a specific agent. <br><br>  It soon became clear that it was impossible to handle such a flow of information manually.  So the idea was to make a website to automate some processes, to be precise, to gather basic information about a candidate and automatically select agents for a particular candidate.  We can say that the foundation of the start-up project was laid. <br><br>  But I understood that it was not enough just to hand over requests to agents.  It is necessary to provide a service that will have value for both agents and candidates. <br><br>  I started receiving many requests from agents.  Most importantly, the need for visa support for candidates whom I could and can offer did not at all scare off agents and employers, although initially I had such concerns.  Moreover, the number of agents wishing to receive nominations has increased.  Among them were independent agents (who work for themselves). <br><br>  I perceived the interest on the part of agents as a signal for a more detailed study of the employment process. <br><br>  The most important conclusion is to provide the full profile of the candidate.  If there is no LinkedIn page - this is a minus.  If there is no gitHub account with code examples, this is also a minus.  If there is, but there is nothing interesting there, it‚Äôs still a minus.  All this means that, neglecting this, a very good candidate reduces his chances, as the employer's primary impression is a summary and portfolio.  And 100% wrong one who thinks that if he is an excellent specialist, he will still be noticed.  They will notice, only for this purpose it will take much more time than if the specialist immediately showed that he can. <br><br>  I can describe the process of finding a job without and with the help of a project: <br>  <i>‚ÄúImagine a recruitment agent named Michael who currently has a number of job vacancies.</i>  <i>To find candidates, he regularly looks at various sites like Monster for a suitable resume, and also spamming on LinkedIn hoping for an answer.</i>  <i>If he finds a resume, he calls up the candidate and sends his resume to the employer for review.</i>  <i>The recruitment agent is not an IT specialist and cannot verify the level of knowledge of the candidate.</i>  <i>Thus, the employer has on the table 20 pieces of resumes of which hardly 2-3 are worth attention.</i>  <i>And the matter is not only in the level of knowledge, but also in accordance with the candidate‚Äôs knowledge to the requirements of the vacancy.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The task of this service is to provide an agent named Michael with a complete candidate profile and pre-check the level of knowledge of the candidate.</i>  <i>Thus, the agent receives a suitable candidate, and the profile of the candidate falls to the agent who has a suitable vacancy.</i>  <i>Of course, the candidate could reach this agent through Monster or other sites, but this would require the candidate time and knowledge to prepare the correct resume and post it on different sites.</i>  <i>"</i> <br><br>  Saving time and assistance in preparing for a job search is a start-up package, which already offers a service.  The next stage will be implemented testing candidates. <br><br>  There is certainly nothing unique about this.  But thanks to the huge demand for IT specialists, there is still something to improve in the process of their employment. <br><br>  Based on personal experience, I derived my job search formula.  I call this formula my own, since I cannot 100% say that the experience of finding a job for others coincides with mine: <br><br><ul><li>  Responsible approach to the issue of finding a job and even more so to interviews. </li><li>  Draw conclusions from the results of each interview. </li><li>  Do not dwell on a particular country. </li><li>  Do not be discouraged when you do not know why there is no result after successful interviews. </li></ul><br><br>  The process of finding a job abroad should be treated very responsibly.  You can not just throw a resume and throw off the agent or employer.  You can still call back and ask questions, but those who do not prepare will not be able to correctly answer them and leave a mediocre impression of themselves.  I can tell you for sure that with the candidate‚Äôs superficial approach to the issue of preparation, agents, and even less employers, will not show much interest in you (and this despite the fact that you can actually be a very good specialist, but still meet clothes).  Not to mention the preparation for the interview.  Studying available information about the company as much as possible is a ‚Äúmust have‚Äù before the interview. <br><br>  Each interview is a source of knowledge, both technical and in terms of interview skills.  But there is another important source of information - this is the company's reviews.  Knowing the honest opinion of the employer about yourself, although it can be sometimes unpleasant, is very helpful.  This information is practically impossible to obtain with the traditional approach to finding work. <br><br>  If a candidate fails a technical interview, this does NOT mean that he does not have sufficient knowledge.  It just means that knowledge needs to be tightened, and often it also means that you need to move from the level of a specialist, who can make everything googling to a specialist, who also knows a great deal from memory.  <b>Answering on the fly to basic technical questions is a very fat plus.</b>  Constantly raising your level and even having feedback on your progress is a great help! <br><br>  The level of knowledge of the language can also be tightened and, if desired, it takes about half a year. <br><br>  The second point is also important, since its implementation guarantees the widest range of possibilities where you do not even suspect.  I will give an example.  Wanting to leave for the United States, a candidate may unsuccessfully spend years searching for work in American companies, while in Europe there are a huge number of companies with offices in the United States and with very real prospects of finding themselves in one such office after some time working in the European branch . <br><br>  The third point, which is of particular importance after the successful implementation of the first two - is the passage of interviews with HR specialists.  Sometimes it happens that after a successful technical interview there is still a refusal without further explanation. <br><br>  So I got the idea to supplement the service with a service for building relationships with independent agents directly.  If the candidates really want to find a job and are ready to literally work on it, and the agents need good specialists and can, and most importantly, they want to go all the way with the candidate side by side - then the chances are very high. <br><br>  Independent agents can prepare a candidate for the interview, tell who exactly the company is looking for.  Agents can help with getting feedback from employers after the interview.  Agents can give advice on account of language level, help with relocation and other org.  questions.  Independent agents like no one are interested in the result and therefore establish good relations with the management of companies in order to have access to insider information.  Exactly the same relationship, I would even say that friendly, should be with the candidates.  It must be understood that it is important for an agent to build long-term relationships not only with employers, but also with candidates.  If the agent sees the candidate‚Äôs desire and desire to grow, he will find him a suitable employer even if it takes a year. <br><br>  So, the main directions of the project: <br>  1. Free agents - this is one of the vectors of development of the project.  It is designed for high-level IT professionals.  Almost all companies are quite strict in assessing the technical knowledge of candidates and preliminary testing at <a href="https://codility.com/programmers/">codility.com</a> is one of the requirements. <br><br>  At the moment, 2 free agents from Germany, an HR specialist with experience in Google and a company that provides services for obtaining work permits, a diploma confirmation and other points related to relocation have joined the project. <br><br>  2. Agents from recruitment companies - this is another source of vacancies.  They are not as interesting as with independent agents, but they have a lot of different vacancies with different salary levels.  The candidate needs to demonstrate his value and then the agent will provide him with suggestions from companies.  The project will help the candidate to prepare a profile with code examples, a LinkedIn account and pass preliminary knowledge testing on the technologies specified by the candidate (programming languages, etc.).  It may be necessary to fill the gaps in knowledge, but all this will add to the candidates confidence and increase their chances very significantly.  It is worth noting that the training is aimed not only at increasing the candidate‚Äôs chances, but it also serves as a test of the desire to find a job abroad.  And this is very important first of all for the candidate himself. <br><br>  3. Attracting companies that value good specialists and are ready to interest them is the main goal of the project. <br><br>  Now I actively implement the first two directions.  To realize the third direction - you need to earn the trust of all parties.  I am glad to have the opportunity to share the experience and results of the development of the project at Megamozg and I very much count on the feedback and opinions of the readers of this blog. <br><br>  So far I have concentrated on Germany - by itself it happened.  Most likely because there the IT sphere is very developed and God alone knows where a good specialist can go from this country.  However, as demand grows, I will expand to other countries in Europe and to the USA. <br><br>  <a href="http://itrabota.com/">itRabota has</a> been recently updated and I hope you will like the picture on the main page.  I like. <br><br>  In the <a href="http://itrabota.com/ru/faq">FAQ</a> section there are answers to your possible questions. <br><br>  I will post useful information on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/coolitrabota">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://vk.com/public101815422">VK</a> , as well as information on the availability of relevant vacancies (there are already 2 vacancies there).  By the way, the nearest useful information will be about how the registration of a work permit and confirmation of a diploma in Germany looks like and how much it costs.  This will be information from an affiliate German company that has been doing this for a long time. <br><br>  Thanks for attention. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294284/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294284/</a></p>
