I carry out. <br><br>  In short, ‚ÄúPolygon‚Äù ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/coworking/47619/">reference1</a> , <a href="http://inklab.ru/projects/">reference2</a> ) is a ‚Äúsandbox‚Äù based on the idea of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/coworking/47619/">co</a> - <a href="http://inklab.ru/projects/">working</a> for young entrepreneurs: here you can experiment, analyze and accumulate experience with minimal risks, without fear of losing all developments due to one stupid mistake. <br><br>  ‚ÄúPolygon‚Äù is a project of the Tower Tower coworking club ( <a href="http://www.effman.ru/coworking/">link 1</a> , <a href="http://office.munga.ru/hakuna_matata">link 2</a> ) and the INK business laboratory.  The Tower provides the business minimum: equipped jobs, a ready legal entity with an accountant and a lawyer, experience and connections of former and current participants.  "INC." Gives a guarantee: no expenses will not take away this minimum from the participant, and no dangerous problems will remain without a solution.

      And at the same time, Polygon does not receive any profit from the participant! <br><br>  <strong>And how does he then work?</strong> <br><br>  And this is our results.  For the fortnight that the country rested, to us - hurray hurray!  - 5 people came, all surprisingly active.  We work hard, spitting on holidays and vacations;  and in addition to advancing the work on projects (which, in general, of little interest to the uninitiated), we did a more socially useful thing: <br><ul><li>  We collected all more or less worthwhile projects that we were engaged in before, but for various reasons we froze (18 in total), </li><li>  Added current projects (total 4), </li><li>  Entered the ideas of those who came during this time (only 3), </li><li>  Entered ideas for which there is no knowledge / experience, but I would like to do something (well, you never know, suddenly there is the right person; only 7) </li><li>  And they made up the GENERAL CONCEPT of the ‚ÄúPolygon‚Äù work. </li></ul><br>  That's about it and I want to tell.  Well, interesting? <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><img src="http://inklab.ru/images/map.png" alt="Project Map Overall Plan"><br><br>  This is our Project Map.  As you can see here, all the existing projects are arranged in a column, and from left to right of the column the life line of each project begins to stretch, broken down into several successive stages. <br><br>  The map clearly shows at what stage each project is.  This is a major plus: TRANSPARENCY.  It is always clear what projects we have and in what condition they are. <br><br>  But there are also pluses: <br><br><img src="http://inklab.ru/images/project.png" alt="Big project"><br><br>  1. First, every stage has a responsible one.  In the picture in the left corner of each stage you can see who took it, and this allows you not to get confused and do not forget anything.  IMPORTANT: any participant can be responsible if he is interested.  Do you like to explore the market?  In all projects, take the stage ‚Äúmarket analysis‚Äù.  Are you interested in real estate?  No question, take for yourself the whole project "Cottage Village".  Have money?  ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù any stages and get in the amount of 20-50-80% of the business profit. <br><br>  2. By the way, yes!  Each stage has its own cost.  This is either a one-time payment (for example, the ‚Äúmarket analysis‚Äù stage), either monthly or SHARE IN BUSINESS.  Need money right now?  Conduct market analysis and get 20 tr.  Need a long term income?  Help the guys in something, and part of the business is deservedly yours.  Of course, for each specific project and the amount and share can be discussed. <br><br>  3. Moreover, each stage has quality criteria (not shown in the figure) and timelines: 2 weeks, a month, half a year.  The deadlines are set in the business plan and allow you to control the overall progress of the project, as well as the work of the responsible: does he deserve his 10% of the business, or is he free?  When the whole project is green, and you still haven't been rolling your horse, you can‚Äôt just turn around ... <br><br>  Want to "Polygon"?  Choose what you want on our Project Card.  There is an idea - add it to the card and 3% of yours, even if you DO NOT do anything else.  There are skills - no question, choose the stages in which you are speakers, and proceed.  There is a desire to join the business - choose any project and join the work.  There is money - invest: all amounts, participants, steps and process in front of your eyes! <br><br>  In general, we are useful for people of (almost) any type. <br><br>  <strong>By the way, about the stages.</strong> <br><br><img src="http://inklab.ru/images/stages.png" alt="Stages of business development"><br><br>  This is the Life Line of a business project, our pride, our charm :) The Life Line not only allows you to TRACKLY where you are in the process of creating your own empire, but also allows you to bring all your projects to one universal form.  And when you know where you are, what to do next and how to distribute the efforts between all projects - it becomes not just easy to work, but VERY SIMPLE. <br><br>  We identify about 20 stages that are needed to create a business.  The more done - the less risk, so we smashed the beginning of work in detail (before reaching the ‚Äú0‚Äù), but did not specify (visually) the optimization and automation processes.  Firstly, they will be written in the business plan anyway;  secondly, by this time the profit will already go, and hired employees will be engaged in this work. <br><br>  The first part of the project is carried out almost consistently.  This is IMPORTANT: if you skip some stage, you can lose a lot of information and eventually burn out (that's why I'm talking about high risks).  Having collected and processed the information, we significantly clarify the situation, and then it becomes possible to DISTRIBUTE work among people in order to conduct the stages independently and in parallel. <br><br>  Yes, by the way: if you copy this scheme and work on it, we will be only happy for you.  But we must understand that the picture does not express, and 10% of the meaning we are laying in it.  For the remaining 90% - come to the "Polygon" :) <br><br>  And one more picture that we use to fully understand the situation - <br><br><img src="http://inklab.ru/images/graph.png" alt="Profit chart"><br><br>  This is the Project Profit Schedule.  We did not come up with it: a slow decline (preparation), a failure (pilot launch), a tight exit to ‚Äú0‚Äù (self-repayment), a sharp rise (tasted!) And a smooth exit to the level (filled niche) are standard and well-known stages.  But, as seen in the picture, there are some interesting additions :) <br><br>  The Profit Schedule helps keep two things in mind: <br><br>  1. The first is the expected costs: which are already passed, and which are still coming.  Often the novice entrepreneur does not know how to realistically estimate the amount of investment he needs;  The Profit Schedule, along with the Life Line, helps to do this.  Use on health! <br><br>  2. The second is investors: who can support you at the stage at which you are now?  Whose attention must be persistently pursued, but on whose obviously it is not worth wasting energy?  The national network of business angels offers a <a href="http://www.private-capital.ru/angels/">very reasonable assessment of the situation</a> , and we have adopted it. <br><br>  Note: INC is ready to support the business throughout its development process.  True, right now we do not have free millions to invest :) But we pay for this shortcoming with what was promised above: with a guarantee, I DON'T WAY your case below a certain minimum level. <br><br>  Like this.  Look again at the Project Card, at the Life Line, at the Profit Schedule - and decide if we can be of help to you.  I very much hope that this will be the case. <br><br>  But the decision is yours. <br>  Sincerely, Alexey Glazkov. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> Yes, we can accept your idea, implement it and give you a percentage.  BUT!  First, the idea is not five words and a picture in the head: it is a detailed document setting out (in a free style) what product / service / service is offered and where such an idea came from.  Secondly, even if there is such a description, we can simply not accept the idea.  You can not even imagine how many people consider themselves to be brilliant innovators, although in fact they offer something like "... and there you can rob korovanov". <br><br>  <b>UPD2:</b> Yes, St. Petersburg people can also participate.  Even the Chinese can.  We are not limited to Yekaterinburg.  But you have to understand that many stages will be unavailable to you: first, only Tower‚Äôs co-workers receive full information on all projects, and second, some things should be done in principle where they can be controlled (If the investor said in Ekb means in Ekb, and so on). <br><br>  <b>UPD3:</b> Yes, only coworkers have complete information.  To become a coworker, you need to come to the "Tower".  The ONLY exception is if you are the author of the project;  then, of course, you will have access to all the information on it.  However, if we become friends, for example, with New-Level, and turn the ‚ÄúPolygon‚Äù into a network - you can come to New-Level, become a co-worker there and get full access.  Now such cooperation is being established in Chelyabinsk.  But so far we have no person who, for the sake of business success, could represent our interests in Kiev, St. Petersburg, Moscow or elsewhere.  Maybe they will become you? <br><br>  <b>UPD4:</b> No, the pictures are not sucked from the finger, not stupid and not wrong.  Each comma has an explanation.  BUT: you will not hear this explanation, at least, until you become the ‚ÄúTower‚Äù co-worker, and as a maximum - you do not raise your business here.  And the point here is not at all that we are afraid of competitors or we feel sorry for the information.  The fact is that in printed form it will inevitably be distorted and perceived NOT as it should be - and then we will be accused of not working, and we are pulling our brains and sucking out money.  Well, I do not!  We are not a guru or MLM.  Nafig need. <br><br>  If you want, come PERSONALLY, ask a million questions, and in two or three days you will understand everything thoroughly.  We are happy to help! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/49125/">https://habr.com/ru/post/49125/</a></p>
