      It must be admitted, it turned out notable trolling from NASA. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/29f/406/d91/29f406d910cf41e1b89218e9a5226292.png" align="left">  NASA SpacePlace simply explains that astronomy and astrology are completely different things.  Astrology is in no way a science.  No one has proved that with the help of astrology, one can predict the future or give a characteristic to a person only on the basis of his date of birth.  This is a completely stupid assumption.  In principle, most people understand this.  This is understood even by those who like to read every day, like fairy stories, their ‚Äúastrological forecast‚Äù or ‚Äúhoroscope‚Äù for the day.  But there are exceptions.  In some particularly neglected cases, people even make important life decisions taking into account the position of the stars in the sky - for example, they compare the "signs of the zodiac" of different people to determine their compatibility. <br><br>  NASA SpacePlace gives a brief overview of what the zodiac and zodiac constellations are. <br><br>  The zodiac (from the Greek, ‚Äúa circle of animals‚Äù) is a belt near the ecliptic, along which the apparent annual movement of the Sun occurs, as well as a sequence of sections into which this belt is divided.  While the sun moves almost strictly along the ecliptic, and various constellations periodically shift north or south of the ecliptic.  The ecliptic passes through 13 constellations: Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces and Ophiuchus, but it was decided to ignore the latter for convenience. <br><br>  When the Earth, the Sun and the constellation are approximately on the same imaginary line, the astrologers believe that at this time "the Sun is in such a constellation." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c59/e44/261/c59e4426173e4b539cbfd00493da069b.gif"><br><br>  In ancient times, astronomers did not fully understand how the Earth, the Sun and the stars move.  They did not understand the scale of the universe, but still did not give up trying to find some kind of regularity.  They tried hard to figure out what they see in the starry sky.  Thanks to a rich human imagination, astrology quite harmoniously fit into many ancient religions. <br><br>  People imagined that constellations could be important symbols, tell stories about their gods and serve as illustrations of myths, ancient stories and tales.  Echoes of those ancient pagan religions and myths we are seeing now in the form of "horoscopes" in women's magazines. <br><br>  For the first time, the concept of the zodiac and the zodiac constellations was introduced in Babylon about 3000 years ago.  Since Babylon used a calendar of 12 months, based on the phases of the moon, it was very convenient to divide the zodiac into 12 equal parts, which correspond to months. <br><br>  According to the Babylonian sources, they consisted of 13 zodiacal constellations, so that one for convenience had to be abandoned.  Unfortunately, even after this, some of the selected dozen did not quite fit into the allotted 1/12 of the year and went beyond their segment.  For example, the Sun passes against the background of the Virgo constellation for 45 days, against the background of Scorpio - 7 days, against the background of Ophiuchus - 18 days.  All this has been simplified, and Ophiuchus has been thrown out altogether. <br><br>  After an incident of 3000 years, the picture has changed a little.  The fact is that when the Earth rotates, there is a <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9">precession of the Earth axis with a period of 25,800 years</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/732/655/d84/732655d841b44c3bb3e6329e7ee0e9f3.gif"><br>  <i>Earth axis precession, view from the north pole.</i>  <i>Animation: <a href="">Ereenegee</a></i> <br><br>  The precession with a period of 25,800 years occurs under the influence of the gravitation of the Moon, the Sun, and the inhomogeneity of the mass distribution density inside the Earth. <br><br>  The ancient astronomers did not know this, so they did not anticipate a shift in the zodiacal constellations relative to the calendar year.  But that is exactly what happened.  Therefore, the current picture of the zodiac is slightly different from the one that was calculated 3000 years ago. <br><br>  Women's journals publish a <a href="http://www.cosmopolitan.co.uk/entertainment/news/a45943/star-sign-horoscope-change-2016/">real table of horoscope signs</a> (according to the dates of the calendar year), as amended for precession, as of 2016.  For example, those born on August 4 considered themselves to be Lions (or Lionesses), but with specified dates of the horoscope they became Cancers. <br><br>  Capricorn: January 20 - February 16 <br>  Aquarius: February 16 - March 11 <br>  Fish: March 11 - April 18 <br>  Aries: April 18 - May 13 <br>  Taurus: May 13 - June 21 <br>  Gemini: June 21 - July 20 <br>  Cancer: July 20 - August 10 <br>  Leo: August 10 - September 16 <br>  Virgo: September 16 - October 30 <br>  Scales: October 30 - November 23 <br>  Scorpio: November 23 - November 29 <br>  Ophiuchus: November 29 - December 17 <br>  Sagittarius: December 17 - January 20 <br><br>  Well, the trolls with NASA SpacePlace note that the accuracy of the ‚Äúhoroscopes‚Äù will not change from the amendments to the precession.  She was zero, and this will remain.  Unfortunately, some of the population will not stop looking for magical advice for their lives.  For example, <a href="https://theconversation.com/some-people-think-astrology-is-a-science-heres-why-28642">21% of UK residents</a> read horoscopes ‚Äúoften‚Äù or ‚Äúvery often‚Äù, and 25% of respondents consider astrology as a ‚Äúvery scientific‚Äù discipline.  Surprisingly, even scientific journals about astrology are sometimes published even in scientific journals. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/397729/">https://habr.com/ru/post/397729/</a></p>
