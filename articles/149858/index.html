  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The experience of organizing WiFi at the conference</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d55/aac/562/d55aac562fa8b8f2ed18b7583e2d20f2.jpg">  It so happened that I was able to participate in the organization of an international conference (medium-scale) ISFD-11th-RCBJSF.  The conference was held in the framework of the Ural state.  University.  A.M.  Gorky. <br>  So, the input data: 5 days of the conference, more than 250 participants from 25 countries.  The venue was chosen World Trade Center in Yekaterinburg.  There were more than enough tasks, but I want to tell you about the organization of a wireless network. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the exhibition center of the World Trade Center there are no fixed WiFi equipment, therefore, all those who rent space are forced to somehow solve this issue themselves. <br><br>  The story began when, in the network department at the university, they said ~ ‚Äúlet's do it yourself somehow‚Äù.  It seems like there is equipment, and a controller for controlling points, but it did not work out.  After an unexpected outcome for us, we began to find out among providers and companies in Yekaterinburg, who can organize a wireless network at the conference.  Having in stock more than a month, due to the specifics of the work of state.  institutions (office services, signatures, approvals, suppliers, again signatures, and so around), had to act very actively. <br>  The requirements were quite simple: <br><ul><li>  coverage throughout the conference area; </li><li>  smooth operation; </li><li>  maximum ease of use for conference participants; </li><li>  some malomalsky roaming; </li></ul><br>  Two weeks later, after endless correspondences and repeated raids on the object, we had several offers from providers and companies who really wanted to help us.  It is understandable, the amounts in these proposals (in my opinion) were above average. <br>  Not to be unfounded, let's see the offer of the Firm Z: <br><ul><li>  The cost of organizing a wireless network <b>36000 p.</b> </li><li>  Wireless network maintenance for 5 days <b>17000 p.</b> </li></ul><br>  Total <b>53 thousand rubles</b> .  <i>You can discuss in the comments what amount in your opinion is acceptable for solving this problem.</i> <br>  The commercial proposal also indicated the equipment that was planned to be used.  And after a brief search on the Internet, it became clear that all WiFi equipment costs 28,000 rubles and is fairly simple to use.  The review of the equipment was already conducted on Habr√©: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/comptek/blog/114722/">one</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/comptek/blog/125876/">two</a> <br><br>  Company A was found in Yekaterinburg, which during the afternoon provided two access points for testing without prepayment and collateral (contract only), which, in my experience, is rare. <br>  For a couple of days, we conducted point tests.  This is what the client squeezes into one thread from the Unify point.

For comparison, here's what a client from a Cisco AP squeezes into one thread. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/569/d36/d6d/569d36d6d4db2d704b1ff01b17b30931.png"><br><br>  Testing of the declared seamless roaming we conducted on copying a large file and video in skype.  Neither there nor there the connection did not stop, which further reinforced our desire to use this equipment. <br><br>  I was also pleased with the possibility of creating a wifi guest network that does not require authorization. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ce7/c3d/330/ce7c3d330344e3d0f04be1cde46c6182.jpg"><br><br>  You can prohibit the guest to see the network environment, after which he has the ability to go only to the Internet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b51/111/740/b51111740f5a840e61db9de5641328fc.jpg"><br><br>  Uplink for a point can be another point, which was very useful for us when we faced switching of sockets (there is a link at the bottom of the post): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d76/4dd/b36/d764ddb3684720c0d63dae71b8fd1fec.jpg"><br><br>  A couple of pictures with modest statistics ( <b>non-IT</b> conference). <br>  Number of clients: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/681/3b4/665/6813b466596a2d891ee81c12a4d9c620.jpg"><br><br>  Wireless traffic: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4dc/0ae/1c8/4dc0ae1c8fe80711ae1c9cb5291280d8.jpg"><br><br>  At some point in time: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/566/e3a/39d/566e3a39dbb34a409296309654baf854.jpg"><br><br>  Coverage at maximum power: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/395/987/35e/39598735ef0a58f94fa354d52f5745d7.jpg"><br><br>  In just 5 days, <b>267</b> devices connected to the wireless network.  And generated <b>109.06</b> GB of traffic. <br>  The maximum recorded <b>138</b> concurrent clients in the network and <b>42</b> clients at one point. <br>  Problems with <b>one</b> person due to ms drivers for asus pceee from 2006.  After updating the drivers for the family, the problem is gone. <br><br>  Findings: <br><ul><li>  Spending a certain amount of effort and time managed to save some good money. </li><li>  WiFi equipment is now ours, and we will use it further </li><li>  Judging by the number of requests (one), we can say that the wireless network worked as we wanted </li><li>  Managed to distract from daily activities </li></ul><br>  I hope this information will be useful to those who are also going to organize a wireless network at a conference, in an office, etc.  and does not want to overpay. <br><br>  Details about the conference on the <a href="http://labfer.usu.ru/isfd-11-rcbjsf/">site</a> . <br>  A couple of interesting points in <a href="http://k1im.ru/blog/podgotovka-k-konferencii-isfd-11th-rcbjsf">preparing</a> for the conference. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a52/dff/52b/a52dff52b7dbc92e26e040e900d18ffb.jpg"><br><br>  There is an opinion that now the Ural State University should be called as the Ural Federal University, but as a graduate of the Ural State University, in my post I will not adhere to this opinion. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/149858/">https://habr.com/ru/post/149858/</a></p>
