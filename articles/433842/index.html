Of course, this is a joke, and the age here, most likely, has nothing to do with it.  My son, for example, loves to play ASCII games that I make.  At least he says so. <br><br>  However, in order to perceive some things, such as the composition of the three canvases in the picture below, you need to have experience interacting with a certain software and hardware. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qf/e8/qv/qfe8qvizvpeloh6i-fseod10eni.jpeg" alt="image">

      Under the cut, you will see many ASCII tracks on monitors of ancient computers and terminals, as well as on other surfaces, for example, on a postage stamp.  Perhaps some of the images I made will find a response in your hearts. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Let me mention two points.  First, all images are synthetic.  I did not directly turn on the devices themselves and did not upload software on them that generates pictures on monitors.  It is rather an ASCII graffiti applied over the top.  For me, this is another reason to admire the cool retro technique. <br><br>  Secondly, the images are accompanied by a legend - my fiction, explaining how this ASCII art could appear in this place. <br><br>  To illustrate both points, consider the following image: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/eq/ge/ax/eqgeaxs6chdt8vcwjvedcrh2frq.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  The picture on the old TV screen appeared when a student of the school of hackers ‚ÄúCYBER JEDI‚Äù snuck into the museum.  He carried out the examination assignment number 317: "To get into the museum of televisions and activate all the exhibits older than 70 years as monitors." <br><br>  You can close the topic of pseudographic commander interfaces using the following image.  This is a recent find by collectors who discovered vintage postage stamps that prove the hypothesis that stamp values ‚Äã‚Äãwere not only in currency, but also in bytes, as well as in hexadecimal. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lt/4_/dw/lt4_dwlzpr5tusd9cb1wesm2q50.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the NASA research center, there would surely be lovers of thematic animation in text mode.  The photo taken in the 1980s captured the IBM System / 370 multiprocessor mainframe with full virtual memory support and a new 128-bit real arithmetic unit. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/a2/my/az/a2myazfgo9xvvs96l60tsvh8mny.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  ASCII artists see the world differently.  When I showed this picture (the first frame of the animation) in my small cozy group on FB, I received critical remarks that the head was turned in the wrong direction, and the leg was not bent, as in the model.  I fixed everything, made the second version and added it to the second frame of the animation.  However, the first option also had a connoisseur, and in response to criticism, the user Juan, for example, said ‚Äúthe first was abstract‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-t/-b/rs/-t-brssc-g1rryrschi2nzzvbie.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  I do not know about you, but monochrome displays are causing me awe.  Especially with green and orange shades.  The photo is a very rare device that you probably see for the first time.  This is a Japanese word processor My OASYS from Fujitsu.  For its time, it was one of the most accessible and lightweight (9.1 kg is the main module, 1.2 kg is the keyboard).  The printer could be mounted on top of the main unit.  The monochrome display (shades of green) had a diagonal of 9 inches. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dm/2j/mf/dm2jmft5f3qmx_nguhe1pnlbuq0.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Deciding to dream up how my first game in text mode on the Nintendo Game &amp; Watch would look, I made one level.  It turned out interesting.  Now, in the new game, I think to make an additional display mode, as on LCD screens of this type. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kj/ut/k4/kjutk4alzk5dil828b3aajnnstw.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  Sometimes during the passage of the game credits are shown - a list of people who participated in one way or another in creating the game.  For my new game ASCIIDENT, I made the first credits option, although the game itself will be ready only in two or three months.  I wanted to convey the feeling that arises during the passage of the entire game after several night hours of battles.  In the photo Commodore 64. In the presentation does not need! <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KoEUzFGFmuY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Please evaluate println (feed) - service and device (fictional) for printing tapes of selected friends in the social.  networks.  Save your friends history on paper! <br><br>  There are people whose publications I always wait and read with interest.  This is a daughter, mother, close friends.  There are friends who write interesting / smart / funny things.  Sometimes you want to re-read, but kilotons of publications and scrolling parsecs hide a needle in a haystack. <br><br>  There is a solution!  Choose social.  network, mark friends, and a small box will automatically print texts from publications.  The paper will keep everything for decades.  You can then hang in a frame or paste over the walls. <br><br>  The built-in neural network automatically converts images into ASCII art. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/za/u7/6t/zau76t-egjvpnokgu5umm5idl0k.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  The most banal surface with ASCII art is a regular poster.  Nevertheless, it is interesting to consider how the levels of the platformer are composed of the characters typed on the keyboard. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tq/wa/de/tqwadeykfgduemcbf_etamtriq0.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  ASCII is definitely not for everyone.  It is difficult to imagine what percentage of the population of the planet knows what it is.  However, to explain this term is easy.  Moreover, it happens that the elements of ASCII art can be successfully entered into the design.  For example, how do you design the cover of my science fiction novel?  <a href="https://habr.com/post/421829/">The novel can be read right here, on Habr√©.</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kc/vf/sc/kcvfsc0p1xah4qolekcj8zjrotu.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  In conclusion, I want to show you the video game <a href="http://asciident.com/">ASCIIDENT</a> in a retro interior.  It seems that the game would look the most authentic on such a technique.  Shows the function of mining - mining resources for subsequent crafting. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Viv3vDlO2Fw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Thank you for looking at the pictures!  Each has its own history of creation, its own circumstances of appearance and related projects.  I cherish each.  I would be infinitely happy if at least one image will cause you a positive feeling.  See you in the ASCII world! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/433842/">https://habr.com/ru/post/433842/</a></p>
