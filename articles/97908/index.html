  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Examining the Exposure - Exposure Triangle</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Bryan Peterson wrote the book Understanding Exposure, which is recommended for reading if you want to break out of the Auto mode in your digital camera and experiment with manual settings. <br>  In it, Brown identifies three main elements that must be considered in experiments with exposure, and calls them the 'Exposure Triangle'. <br>  Each of its three sides refers to the light: how it gets inside and interacts with the camera. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Three elements:</b> <br>  1. Light sensitivity of the camera matrix (ISO) - determines the sensitivity of the digital camera matrix to light <br>  2. Aperture - the size of the slit in the lens at the time of shooting <br>  3. Shutter Speed ‚Äã‚Äã- the amount of time that the shutter is open <br>  From the intersection of these three elements and the resulting exposure. <br>  The most important thing is that changing one element will affect all the others.  This means that you will not be able to manipulate only one element with impunity - you always have to keep track of the others. <br><br>  <b>3 metaphors for understanding the exposition triangle of digital photography:</b> <br>  Many, describing the relationship between photosensitivity, aperture and shutter speed, use metaphors to help settle the subject.  Let me share three.  However, like any other metaphors, they are far from perfect and are only illustrative: <br><br>  <b>Window</b> <br>  Imagine that your camera is a window with shutters that open and close. <br>  Aperture is the size of the window.  The larger it is, the more light comes in and the room becomes brighter. <br>  Exposure is how long the shutters are open.  The longer you leave them open, the more light gets inside. <br>  Now imagine that you are sitting in this room wearing sunglasses.  Accordingly, your eyes are less susceptible to light (the same thing happens at low photosensitivity values). <br>  There are several ways to increase the amount of light in the room (or at least make it seem so. You can keep the shutters open longer (increase shutter speed) or make the window bigger (open the aperture wider)) or you can remove sunglasses (increase the sensitivity). . <br>  In general, this is not the best example, but you understand what's the point.

      <b>Tanning!</b> <br>  Another metaphor that a friend recently shared with me is to imagine that exposure is how to get a tan. <br>  I have never managed to properly tan due to my skin.  And all I got was that I was burning in the sun.  Thus, the sensitivity of the skin is comparable to the value of photosensitivity.  Some people are more susceptible to the sun than others. <br>  Exposure to this metaphor is how much time you spend in the sun.  The more you spend in the sun, the greater the chance of getting a tan (of course, if you spend a lot of time in the sun, this means that the picture is overexposed). <br>  The diaphragm is a sunscreen that is applied to the skin.  The cream ‚Äúblocks‚Äù the sun with different strengths, which depends directly on the type of cream chosen.  Even if you apply a cream to a person who is very sensitive to sunlight, this will help him spend more time in the sun (for example, by increasing the aperture of the aperture, you can use a shorter shutter speed and / or decrease the sensitivity). <br>  As I have already said, none of the metaphors is perfect, but they allow us to illustrate the dependence of each element on the other two. <br><br>  The third metaphor that I heard is the garden hose: the thickness of the hose is the diaphragm, the time during which water flows from the hose is exposure, and the pressure of the water is photosensitivity. <br><br>  <b>Summarizing</b> <br>  Improving the art of exposure requires a considerable amount of time.  In many ways, this is the art of evaluation, and even experienced photographers are experimenting with the settings in the process.  Always consider that changing one of the elements not only affects the image exposure, but also other aspects of it (for example, changing the size of the aperture changes the depth of field, changing the sensitivity value affects the graininess of the picture, and changing the shutter speed affects how the motion is captured ). <br>  What is good about digital cameras is that they are ideal tools for studying exposure.  You can take as many pictures as you like and it will not cost you anything, and they not only allow you to shoot in Automatic and Manual modes - but also in semi-automatic modes, such as 'aperture priority' and 'shutter priority', which allow you to make decisions about one of the two elements, leaving the right to choose the remaining two automatic camera. <br>  Much more can be said about each of the three elements, but more on this in other articles </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/97908/">https://habr.com/ru/post/97908/</a></p>
