Organizational model of the platform and its use</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h3>  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãdistant amusement, characterized by an incredibly high rate of labor efficiency, each year gains an increasing number of active adherents.  The largest web development studios are now actively working to attract young professionals who are ready to perform official duties on the principle of remote maintenance.  The list of available areas of development in this case includes many alternatives suitable for representatives of different professional fields. </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/76a/500/0d9/76a5000d91136ddd7b32a44f57e04ab4.png" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Earn money with equal efficiency can both programmers conducting the development and configuration of intelligent products, and designers who prepare and implement design elements.  Of course, in this vein we are talking mainly about the performers of the high level class.  For example, many web platforms impose a high level of input requirements on their potential employees - a user applying for a specialist position must have a wealth of knowledge and experience behind his back.  But is there an alternative in the modern network space that can provide acceptable working conditions for inexperienced users who lack any specialized training? <br><br>  Quite attractive and unpretentious ways of making money on the Internet are being promoted today by numerous mobile corporations.  So, in the world of portable technical devices, the so-called direction of user motivation is especially popular.  Great success in this subject area was achieved by the company ‚ÄúDzhusisoft‚Äù, which developed the universal <a href="https://www.appbonus.ru/">AppBonus</a> application, suitable for smartphones based on Android and iOS.  Since the beginning of 2015, the management team has been actively working to attract efficient users.  It is noteworthy that the interested persons in this case are not constrained by any restrictive standards - to begin the development of their activities, the user only needs to have a mobile device (smartphone, tablet) and a proper working fuse.  The procedure for earning on AppBonus cannot be called complicated.  So, the tasks placed in the mobile catalog can be performed with due persistence even by a primary school student.  But what is the whole essence of this kind of activity?  What types of work does the AppBonus project guide promote?  What advantages and disadvantages does the application currently have?  We will be able to study all the topics presented as part of this review. <br><br><h4>  Basics of the AppBonus Work Organization </h4><br>  The introductory stage of our review begins with the evaluation of the official website AppBonus.ru.  The site of the management company has an extremely minimalistic look that focuses the attention of the target audience on the key performance indicators of the mobile system.  So, at the current time point, the base of its active performers accommodates more than 550 thousand people.  The amount of funds paid for the entire working period at the same time exceeds 48 million rubles.  However, the rating score of the application (4.7 points) brings it to first place in terms of attractiveness in the official stores of the Play Market and the App Store.

      Introductory information, which is also present in the main page of the website, briefly describes the organizational model of the AppBonus project.  Key operations within the system are performed by four separate user groups.  To them we can include managers, advertisers, partners and performers.  Each participant involved in business cooperation performs its own range of tasks, forming in the final account a complete working chain of events.  We will try to describe the sequence of their actions in the following sequence: <br><ol><li>  an advertiser who wants to promote his mobile application in the official stores of Google and Apple, concludes an agreement with the head of the system and transfers payment for mediation services to his account; </li><li>  the manager, who has confirmed that payment has been received, places a new task of the advertiser in the AppBonus system; </li><li>  partners, stimulated by passive profits, attract new performers to the ranks of the participants of the system; </li><li>  performers motivated by instant profit perform the advertiser‚Äôs task received in the working directory. </li></ol><br>  This detailing of operations allows you to fully understand the organizational principles of the mobile AppBonus system.  Each participant mentioned in the list reaches their individual goal in the final score.  In this case, the advertiser moves in the direction of the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãpopularizing his intellectual product.  All the other members of the cooperation are motivated for the most part only by financial profit.  To study in more detail the capabilities and responsibilities of the participants can be in the points of the official user agreement. <br><br>  Having become familiar with the organizational model, the user can proceed directly to the stage of installation and configuration of the mobile application.  Download AppBonus in the present moment of time can be either in manual or automatic mode.  With the manual approach, the user will have to independently complete the entire sequence of actions - go to the mobile store‚Äôs catalog (Play Market, App Store), sort the available applications, select the desired alternative and start its installation.  With the automatic approach, the operational scheme is simplified to the level of two simplest operations (binding a mobile number on the official website and then downloading the program from the server).  The eventually installed application opens a welcome screen detailing the principle of using a profitable system.  To get started, the new participant must successfully complete the initial registration procedure.  The order of its passage, we will examine in more detail.  The procedure for generating a new account consists of several ordered steps: <br><ol><li>  Mobile account connection (Google Account or Apple ID); </li><li>  enter a promotional code (if any); </li><li>  binding of the mailing address and social profiles (Facebook, Vkontakte); </li><li>  confirmation of mobile phone number. </li></ol><br>  A participant who has completed the registration sequence gets access to all main sections of the system.  Their full list includes the following elements: <br><ol><li>  ‚ÄúApplications‚Äù is a user's work sheet filled with the tasks of advertisers; </li><li>  "Balance" - a tool for financial management and withdrawal of earnings; </li><li>  ‚ÄúFriends‚Äù - menu of the affiliate program; </li><li>  ‚ÄúProfile‚Äù - setting user account parameters; </li><li>  ‚ÄúFAQ‚Äù is a quick reference system. </li></ol><br>  This uncomplicated at first glance structure provides in practice a competent distribution of information blocks.  This, in turn, significantly simplifies the process of pairing the user with the system - each separately selected area of ‚Äã‚Äãwork corresponds to its individually defined section.  We are, of course, more interested in the revenue component of the application, which we will discuss in more detail later. <br><br><h4>  Earnings scheme in the system of mobile motivation AppBonus </h4><br>  In the system monitored by us, <a href="https://ruscash.biz/2018/09/18/mobilniy-zarabotok/">mobile earnings is</a> built entirely and entirely on the principle of processing the simplest tasks of advertisers.  The profitable activity of the user in this case is conducted in a dedicated section of the "application".  The working catalog contains tasks divided into three functional categories: available jobs (list of new orders from customers), bonus works (individual external orders) and active jobs (tasks taken for processing).  AppBonus official assignments do not have much variation, along with their unofficial counterparts.  Nevertheless, it is they who in current conditions have the greatest demand among users.  Each classic task included in the group of available tasks has its own standardized set of basic parameters: <br><ol><li>  processing rules (strict rules governing the procedure for performing target operations); </li><li>  sequence of actions (phased distribution of the main stages of the work); </li><li>  profitability (detailed estimate of the cost of each work step). </li></ol><br>  The key essence of the classic instructions is to download and launch applications of advertisers.  It is important to note that the downloadable intellectual product does not carry any danger - the administration of the AppBonus system correctly filters the applications of customers, leaving only reliable protected programs and games among the active alternatives.  The principle of operation in this vein is governed by individually formed regulations.  However, this does not prevent us from drawing up a general scheme of mobile earnings on the official tasks of AppBonus.  It will have the following cyclical view: <br><ol><li>  opening order description (dedicated work card); </li><li>  studying the order processing rules (sequence analysis); </li><li>  taking the order to work (confirmation of consent to the provision of services); </li><li>  gradual fulfillment of advertiser‚Äôs requirements (software search, download and installation); </li><li>  acceptance of the amount of monetary reward (verification of the transfer of finance at the final stage of work). </li></ol><br>  Thus, the main income on AppBonus is reduced to the cyclical implementation of the five simplest actions.  Such unpretentious work can bring a very good daily income to an experienced contractor - the average cost of executing one order ranges from 5 to 10 rubles.  Of course, all this describes only the principle of working with classical problems.  In addition to them, as we noted earlier, in the mobile system there are also bonus orders related to the individual working group.  Their structure includes the most diverse in their thematic content orders originating from the partner organizations AppBonus.  Among the most common tasks include polls, tests and advertising views.  The demand for such works, as well as their attractiveness, is determined entirely and fully by the cost component - the low level of financial remuneration automatically puts them in the background. <br><br>  A performance-oriented performer should not forget about the regular development of their skills.  The AppBonus system pays particular attention to the career advancement of users.  Thus, the administrative team currently identifies 8 ranking classes, characterized by individual indicators of profitability.  A beginner who does not have even the slightest experience behind him is automatically ranked as the lowest career level (0% surplus profit).  A professional who has processed more than one hundred orders is ranked as the highest career level (10% of additional profit).  Such a significant difference once again motivates users, forcing them to regularly develop and improve.  The conditions for raising the career rank are extremely simple here - the performer should only produce high-quality processing of the instructions he accepts.  In this case, it is important to note that each individual level of development imposes individual requirements on the performance indicators of the user. <br><br>  The participant who has reached the top of the career ladder expands the set of his internal system rights and at the same time receives the maximum permissible rate of return on labor.  However, even this approach does not use all the open resources of the mobile AppBonus application.  The bonus program allows you to earn more money, the rules for exploitation of which will be discussed in detail in the final section of the review. <br><br><h4>  Earnings scheme for the bonus program AppBonus </h4><br>  Today, every participant in the discussed mobile system can try on the role of partner.  The bonus program in this case allows you to form a source of additional profit accrued to the user's balance in the passive mode.  It is noteworthy that you can take advantage of this opportunity even at the early stages of your work - a unique partner identifier is automatically assigned to all users at the registration stage.  Having decided to expand his circle of activities, the user should first of all familiarize himself with the rules for using the bonus program.  A detailed description of the partnership agreement is located in a dedicated section "friends".  In fact, in fact, all the key operations of the newly-made partner are performed.  The administration of AppBonus initially tries to distribute the tasks of beginners in a more rational way, transferring to their use a streamlined earnings scheme.  Thus, the organization of an effective source of passive income is built on the basis of a cyclic sequence of the following actions: <br><ol><li>  placement of the partner identifier (promotional code) on advertising Internet resources; </li><li>  distribution of invitation letters in connected social networks (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Vkontakte); </li><li>  tracking the activity of invited users in the statistical menu of the application. </li></ol><br>  In this case, only the question of the profitability of this type of activity remains open.  The capital inflow is provided by the activity of the so-called referrals - beginners, redirected to the registration section by the link partner.  Each user invited to the system brings his referrer a fixed interest income (20% of all cash charges).  However, all this does not limit the financial possibilities of the bonus program in the current reality.  The partner can receive the amount of additional remuneration in case one or another of his referrals reaches the second level of the career ladder.  The size of the remuneration in this situation will be 2 rubles. <br><br>  In conclusion, it is worth adding a few words about the current financial management subsystem.  Examine the details of the accrual of cash payments to a participant in the system in the "balance" section.  Detailed statistics clearly shows the amount of rewards and the time of their receipt.  Of course, at the same time, the target offer is also indicated, for the execution of which one or another incentive amount was transferred.  In the same section is located and instrument cashing of financial savings.  Money received by the user during the mobile earnings can be transferred to his mobile number or electronic commercial account (QIWI, WebMoney, Yandex.Money).  It is important for a newbie in this vein to take into account the current system limitations - only executors who have reached the third level of career development receive access to the services of Yandex and WM companies.  The minimum amount of withdrawal, however, does not fall under the strict bans of leadership.  In the current conditions of development, a member of the AppBonus system can withdraw even 1 ruble from his balance. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  The AppBonus system we studied in all trivialities expands the modern industry of distant amusement, connecting the most inexperienced Internet users to the serious work.  The conditions promoted by the administration make it easy to make money on the simplest tasks associated with finding and installing mobile applications.  One completed task, as we managed to find out, can bring the responsible executive from 5 to 10 rubles of profit.  More advanced users, however, are able to use bonus programs that provide additional capital.  The money received as a result of the work is instantly transferred to the participant‚Äôs mobile number or its electronic commercial account. <br><br>  To date, the benefits of the profitable platform have already been estimated by 550 thousand people.  Its mass popularity is confirmed by official ratings of Google and Apple rating services.  Thus, the quality indicators in the branded stores of the Play Market and the App Store have not dropped below their 4.7 points since their release.  All this, of course, describes the AppBonus application from the best side.  But is it good in practice?  To form a holistic assessment of the system, you can use a comparative analysis of its strengths and weaknesses.  The user who compared these characteristics will be able to ultimately determine the further expediency of participating in a mobile project. <br><br>  Among the positive qualities of the system we can include: <br><ol><li>  the presence of an auxiliary website AppBonus.ru (a virtual platform allows you to quickly download AppBonus to your phone, bypassing the lengthy search operations and settings); </li><li>  high-quality implementation of the application (each separately selected area of ‚Äã‚Äãwork corresponds to its individually defined section); </li><li>  low threshold of entry (to start the development of its activities, the user needs to have only a mobile device and a proper working fuse); </li><li>  a work sheet that is constantly updated with tasks (numerous orders are presented, divided into categories of main and bonus orders); </li><li>  tool for career development of users (8 rank classes, characterized by individual indicators of profitability); </li><li>  support of bonus programs (they allow forming the source of additional profit accruing to the user's balance in the passive mode); </li><li>  variability of the financial management subsystem (unlimited withdrawal of funds in any preferred direction). </li></ol><br>  Among the negative qualities of the system we can include: <br><ol><li>  low cost parameters of bonus tasks (unsatisfactory level of financial reward automatically brings them to the background); </li><li>  restriction on the use of the financial regulation subsystem (access to the services of Yandex and WM companies is obtained only by performers who have reached 3 levels of career development). </li></ol></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/246729/">https://habr.com/ru/post/246729/</a></p>
