      Like this.  Risk your money, putting at stake career, a lot of work, you have created your company.  And they became parasites for their employees. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The fact is that all hired staff - he comes from the two thousandth.  When wages were high, and the load is small. <br><br>  Oh, how quickly they got used to the good.  Beautiful offices, slow work, chatting with colleagues, easy money.  Boys and girls who came to conquer the big cities, you went to work like a zoo, where you just need to sit in your cages and smile to the bosses. <br><br>  And life suddenly became a circus and it turned out that the concept of work meant jumping under the dome, cycling and dancing around customers.  Managers and managers in beautiful costumes were picked up by the icy winds of crises and abandoned in the real world.  In the world, where what they considered skills and skills turned into a pumpkin;  in a world where you need to plow, and not to talk. <br><br>  Unexpectedly, it turned out that business owners expect some results from them. <br><br>  How do we know this?  We make employee control system.  And the fact that now the head will be aware of all the correspondence in social networks, many hours of sitting on news sites and videos and success in tank battles, makes people splash a little hate in the comments on our Facebook page. <br><br>  <b>"I would not work a day in a company where they do not trust employees."</b> <br><br>  Trust is a bit of a non-corporate concept.  Trust friends and family.  With the company enter into an agreement.  People so demanding trust from employers, the store will carefully look at the product packaging - are they not expired, not trusting the store at all? <br><br>  <b>"The collective is a family, and in the family they do not spy one after another."</b> <br><br>  First, those who do not follow in the family, for example, who their child is friends with, risk finding it in the company of beer or drug lovers.  And, secondly, the team has never been a family.  These are people who have signed a contract with the company.  They undertake to work, and the company - to pay.  And if the cash gap happens and the owner asks the ‚Äúfamily-like‚Äù to suffer, then there will be a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãindignation. <br><br>  <b>"Professionals do not need control."</b> <br><br>  Pushkin also said that we all look to Napoleons, and the rare occupant of the office is ready to admit that he is an ordinary link in the production chain.  A link from which discipline and performance are primarily required. <br><br>  <b>‚ÄúGive people tasks and control their execution.</b>  <b>If they do, let them play, walk. ‚Äù</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Aha, and when next time you distribute tasks, the huge begging eyes of Kota-in-boots from the Shrek cartoon will look at you, and their owner will assure that it is impossible to do this amount of work in three days, you need six.  In fact, two days are enough, but then you won‚Äôt play ... <br><br>  <b>‚ÄúPeople are not robots, it‚Äôs impossible to work all the time, you need to rest‚Äù</b> <br><br>  Of course you need, it is only desirable at this time to take a walk, get some fresh air.  In order for the blood to run, the eyes rested and the working capacity increased.  But the hands themselves are trying to launch a browser ... <br><br>  <b>‚ÄúIf people don't work in a company, then the leaders are to blame.‚Äù</b> <br><br>  Heads, hear?  It's all your fault!  That you badly set tasks, insufficiently motivated subordinates and little booze at meetings about space ships and the Bolshoi Theater.  And gentle creatures, who trust in you because of the monitors, are completely innocent. <br><br>  To read all this is of course sad.  Moreover, most of the comments written during working hours ... <br><br>  <b>Is there any hope of change?</b> <br><br>  Of course have.  Only we believe in different things.  I am in the fact that our people will love the business in which they are engaged and will begin to give him all their working time.  And they hope that the good old days will return, cozy offices will open their doors, where an easy chair and solitaire on the monitor screen will be waiting. <br><br>  <b>Do I need to consider employee time?</b> <br><br>  Programmers, designers and representatives of other creative professions usually do not, but if the deadlines are systematically disrupted, and the quality of work suffers, then such control will be one of the ways to find out what is wrong - in a low qualification, in work difficulties or in what a person does personal affairs. <br><br>  Call center operators, accountants, logistics managers, sales managers and other clerks should be monitored.  First, identify low-skilled loafers.  And secondly, you will find problems in management.  After all, not always people idle on their own fault.  It is possible that no one has loaded the employee with work, and the manager does not know anything about it. <br><br>  May your company be strong! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/321282/">https://habr.com/ru/post/321282/</a></p>
