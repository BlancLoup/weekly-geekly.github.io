  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About Christmas trees</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Tonight in the AppStore and GooglePlay, a new application, local chat, <a href="http://yolki.cc/">Yolki</a> , created with the help of Glavstart, has appeared. <br><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãYolki came to Sergey Prokoshev and Evgeny Boger 5 years ago at a lecture at the university, when they wanted to discuss the boring teacher and pass the time with everyone during the course.  There is still no simple solution to this problem.  So the basis of the future application was laid the first fundamental principle. <br><br><h5>  Simplicity </h5><br>  The whole dynamic should be reduced to three principles: come, saw (thought) and wrote. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dbb/7b4/bc7/dbb7b4bc74a1cdec6f4ee23d357a1042.jpg"><br>  So the user begins to communicate with their surroundings instantly.  But for this it was necessary to lay the second fundamental principle.

      What else?  Read on. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Locality </h5><br>  If the information is structured, then it has great potential.  In the case of Yolki, this filter became the territory where communication takes place.  This type of information is not very outdated, and in the future it is a kind of knowledge.  Communication within Yolki is conducted in two sections: on the wall and in the rooms. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9ce/8eb/8f6/9ce8eb8f6fc8b8fb6aef533baf9f5a22.jpg"><br>  On the wall, messages are poorly structured into threads, while rooms are an example of thematic communication.  Creating rooms is the only paid service that is a privilege, since  free can not be due to the fact that everyone in this scenario wants to create an unlimited number of them and there will be a lot of territory without communication.  All rooms can be divided into several types: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8a3/d50/7a8/8a3d507a8c478d261b809f44ba0cbe37.jpg"><br><br>  The first type includes rooms ‚ÄúOn the topic ...‚Äù, closed and one-on-one.  All of them have the same functionality, the difference of each is clear from the name. <br><br>  The second type is branded rooms.  They are designed for commercial establishments that can use them to customize communication with customers or use them as a book of reviews.  The cost of creating such rooms is 10 times higher than ordinary ones, but they have two additional functions: a special icon, which is a confirmation of the formality for which it was paid, and a fixing function for the location.  Ordinary rooms are moved behind the creator, and branded rooms can be fixed on the territory of the institution, so that the owner, sitting at home, can look after the activity inside his restaurant, for example. <br><br>  The third type is special rooms from Yolki.  For now, there are two of them: the reviews room and the Instagram room.  The latter displays all photos of people who were taken within a radius of 3000 meters from the current position of the user.  These photos can be discussed on the wall, unsubscribe to the author on Instagram or add it to subscribers, without going into the service itself.  Those.  It is now convenient to meet through this mechanism with your neighbors or the territory when visiting another region. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f21/d83/54a/f21d8354a49dfb0bb00c5edac5ba63fd.jpg"><br>  In the future, the number of such services, generating any content on the territory, will be increased. <br><br><h5>  Anonymity </h5><br>  This principle refers to the strong, but not fundamental characteristics of the application.  In Yolki there is no registration and authorization.  In one click after installing the application, you are immersed in communication. <br><br>  At the first visit, each user has an anonymous profile, then he can create additional ones with distinctive characteristics.  To keep the secret of his identity or not - his right. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/626/104/513/62610451358a2713ec2dfc59e1e80930.jpg"><br>  Multiple profiles allow you to quickly reincarnate when changing your social circle or use this opportunity for gaming purposes - to speak simultaneously on behalf of a girl and a man, for example. <br><br>  The main target audience of the application are: students and schoolchildren, as well as office staff.  Potential territory for communication are any places where there is a high concentration of people.  At the first stage, there is a high probability that there will be no one to talk to, or the list of interlocutors will not be high.  But from the second fundamental principle, this is even a plus. <br><br><h5>  Potential and quality growth </h5><br>  Yolki will become a global local communication tool and a source of interactive information from the scene for the media.  Those.  it will soon be possible to broadcast from anywhere in the world or to follow what is happening there, what is being watched. <br><br>  In the <a href="http://search.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZContentLink.woa/wa/link%3Fpath%3Dapp%252Fyolki">AppStore</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcc.yolki">GooglePlay</a> Yolki appeared on May 22 for Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Armenia and Azerbaijan. <br><br>  By the way, if you have an android, you can enter the special secret code <b>welcomehabr</b> and get free <b>buns</b> in the application. <br><br>  This is still only the first version of the application, so when errors are detected and wishes arise, it is better not to kick them, but to write to hello@yolki.cc. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/144321/">https://habr.com/ru/post/144321/</a></p>
