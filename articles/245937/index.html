      So, let's begin! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Make a terrific first impression. <br><br>  <b>1. Choose great photos</b> <br>  When you will be engaged in adjustments of the page on Facebook, pay special attention to the main profile photo.  It should reflect the maximum type of your activity and be of high quality.  Imagine someone found your webpage for the first time.  What would you like this person to understand about you?  If you are a freelancer, for example, what are your tasks?  The photo should give answers to the maximum number of questions. <br><br>  <b>2. Fill in the section "About Me"</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1c7/2e5/00f/1c72e500f3f749e59182dd4c0833ce1e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Immediately below the photo you will see a link to your profile.  Fill it as fully and correctly as possible.  So visitors can find out information about you and your business.  Please note: in addition to the link to your profile, there is also a column on the left.  Visitors to your page will be able to immediately find out the most important thing about you (without having to go anywhere).  Often forget about it, but in vain.  Do not forget about the opt-in (the consent of your customers to subscribe).  Mailing will be carried out through e-mail. <br><br>  <b>Create stunning content strategy</b> <br><br>  <b>3. Create posts that teach, entertain and inspire</b> <br>  People spend a lot of time searching for information of interest to them, reading the news, looking for opportunities to entertain themselves and find ways to solve their problems.  If you can meet their needs, then not only make sure that everything you do is not in vain, but also ensure that they will be happy to see you in their Ribbon.  So work on your content strategy. <br><br>  <b>Learn to write effective headlines.</b> <br>  People are constantly busy.  And in order for your updates to reach the goal and attract attention, you need to try.  Hone your skills in writing catchy headlines, and it will bear fruit.  Excellent headlines will promote you on Facebook faster than you can say the word itself. <br><br>  <b>Publish posts to attract the maximum number of visitors</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6b5/631/067/6b56310673524740b3904158e07665e4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Think about exactly what posts will be interesting to your visitors in the process of promotion on Facebook.  Now get distracted and think about how you want to see your ideal audience?  What exactly can make them lift their thumbs up, expressing satisfaction?  Photos work well, as they are perfectly visible in the tape, the same goes for the video.  Use them in tandem, complementing your daily posts. <br><br>  <b>4. Ask your audience questions, but those that do not make them think long and strain their brains.</b>  A question that is answered in a single word or sentence will involve more users in the discussion, keep this in mind.  Quotes, humorous cuts, tips and tricks - use it all!  Do not forget to hold contests, publish advertising posts, but neatly and minimally. <br><br>  <b>5. Aim for the maximum</b> <br>  Update posts when most of your target audience is online.  Ponder and create your posts in advance, as well as repeat them, since all the same, not all of your subscribers are online when you create a new post.  Entries on Facebook do not live long, and therefore you need to regularly update them. <br><br>  <b>6. Use high quality images.</b> <br><br>  Anyone who uses Facebook to grow their business and doesn‚Äôt attract the full power of photos to do this simply loses money.  People are emotional creatures, and always pay attention to a beautiful photo that suddenly pops into a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãtext messages.  We simply cannot ignore the post, if we have a photo in front of us, the eye will surely hook it, forcing it to linger, to go deeper. <br><br>  <b>7. Tell your business story.</b> <br>  You can tell your story using a series of photos.  Try to make them convey the meaning as fully as possible.  Make sure the images evoke an emotional response. <br><br>  <b>8. Inspire with photo</b> <br>  Ask the fans to share (make a repost) the materials they liked.  A special button is on your page. <br><br>  <b>9. Teach people</b> <br>  Tell your audience how to do something.  If you use images, you get an excellent master class. <br><br>  <b>10. Do not use images only.</b> <br><br>  Do not upload just a photo.  Supplement it with quotes, sayings, tips, or any other useful and information.  The effect of this will be several times higher. <br><br>  <b>11. Minimalism - your trump card</b> <br><br>  Do not add a lot of text or other elements to the photo in pursuit of attracting attention.  This may have the opposite effect. <br><br>  <b>Learn how to manage ads on Facebook</b> <br><br>  <b>12. Workshop targeting</b> <br><br>  You could click on the special "Promote" button and force the promotion of your post on Facebook.  However, do not do this.  It would be better if you run an ad on Facebook that allows you to achieve clear targeting.  As a result, this can turn out to be a huge CPC, but when you promote a post, the targeting options will be limited. <br><br>  You can start by exploring the pages of your competitors using the search for it.  There should be plenty of them for you to carefully analyze them for some time.  If you have a decent list of email addresses, then you can pull it up on Facebook to create a similar audience.  In the end, you can create a customer base that meets your criteria. <br><br>  <b>13. Let's pick up the Power Editor.</b> <br><br>  It is strongly recommended to use the services of a specialist - expert on advertisements on Facebook.  It will help to understand the Power Editor tool.  This is not so difficult, and you do not have to spend hundreds of dollars on advertising.  You will receive expert assistance, and this will help prevent common mistakes in the future. <br><br>  <b>14. As soon as you start running your ads, start their split testing.</b>  Stop any ads that do not work, and leave only those that are most clickable.  There is a simple way to understand this: follow the ad until it has reached 50 clicks, and then analyze what it costs you to launch. <br><br>  <b>15. Use remarketing</b> <br><br>  Using advertisements on FB, you can also attract the attention of those people who visited your profile without registering.  These people showed interest in what you offer, and as soon as you feel confident in advertising, you can create ads specifically for this audience. <br><br>  <b>Create groups</b> <br><br>  Groups on FBs are a great way to build strong links between your readers, future and current customers. <br><br>  <b>16. Create a personal group for prepaid customers only.</b> <br><br>  Offer this exclusive access as part of a program, course, or product update.  People must send a request to join.  Customers will have to pay for the opportunity to cooperate with you more closely, as well as for the chance to join a group of like-minded people. <br><br>  <b>17. Create a shared group for your subscribers.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9d3/a43/c4b/9d3a43c4b0ff45caa809a4c30b66a382.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  People need to subscribe to your newsletter or Tape to get into this group.  You need to make every effort to promote it in order to attract a significant number of customers.  You interact with the members of this group, they see your work, and they are one level higher than those who are in your mailing list. <br><br>  <b>18. Add other groups to work.</b> <br><br>  You can join other groups to communicate with partners and customers. <br><br>  <b>Stand out on Facebook</b> <br><br>  People spend a lot of time on FB, but most of them spend it on communicating with friends, family, and not on business.  It is worth taking action to ensure that your ads are not sunk into oblivion. <br><br>  <b>19. Be a real person</b> <br><br>  Interact with people and communicate.  Pay attention to both criticism and praise.  Do not be faceless business unit. <br><br>  <b>20. Publish yourself</b> <br><br>  Let your posts be interesting.  Share some personal information, show what you are interested in. <br><br>  <b>21. Use the best images.</b> <br><br>  As already mentioned, the photo is very important.  Choose photos of excellent quality, differentiate from competitors and position yourself as a professional. <br><br>  <b>22. Be civilized</b> <br><br>  Always be polite, despite the fact that you want to say everything that you think to someone in the face. <br><br>  <b>23. Be consistent</b> <br><br>  The best way to impress customers is to always do what you promised.  Very soon it will give excellent results. <br><br>  <b>Keep your finger on the pulse</b> <br><br>  On the FB there are several functions in order to track the actions of competitors. <br><br>  <b>24. Use FB pages for tracking</b> <br><br>  You can see which posts they added, quotes, photos and which ones got the most bang for your buck. <br><br>  <b>25. FB has an excellent feature: you can add pages to your list of interests.</b>  This way you can spy on them, but they won't know about it. <br><br>  <b>Select the essence</b> <br><br>  People get upset because they do not know what to bet on and what to pay more attention to.  They just drown in the flow of information. <br><br>  <b>26. Look at the metrics on the right.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ec6/886/a68/ec6886a68b0448298de50709362e8697.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Do not be discouraged if you think that you have insufficient audience coverage.  There are more important metrics to keep track of.  To begin with - do not look at the achievements, but pay attention to the number of people who are active in one way or another. <br><br>  <b>27. Upload statistics and look at the big picture.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f78/f03/1cd/f78f031cd4494d1fba6e3083ffcb0c37.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  You can summarize all statistical materials and see which of your posts are the most successful.  Thus, it is possible to determine the path of further development. <br><br>  <b>Use Facebook to build your email database</b> <br><br>  This may seem illogical, but the success of a business page is far from the number of likes.  This is all significant, but the main goal is to attract potential customers. <br><br>  <b>28. Create a proper and truly attractive offer for your target audience.</b> <br><br>  Create customized offers to generate leads.  What becomes clear very quickly works very well. <br><br>  <b>29. Place ads to build a list of contacts.</b> <br><br>  You can advertise important updates and posts, but you will get the most out of the money spent, only when you lead people to a landing page that is honed accordingly.  You can create a page for this purpose on your website or use a separate page. <br><br>  <b>30. Do not forget to whet the interest of your newly acquired customers</b> and make an initial offer using the service automation services of your electronic mailing service.  Use a series of letters prepared in advance to gain favor and trust, and ultimately offer the product or service at the optimum time in the best possible way. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/86b/784/adf/86b784adf9b741f694f7fa6f31280c5a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Let's sum up.</b>  So, in order to master Facebook in 2015 to develop your business, you need to learn more about the principles of this social network, and not only have superficial and fragmentary knowledge.
