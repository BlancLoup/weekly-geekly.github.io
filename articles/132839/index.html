  <section class="page js-page"><h1>We use Google Docs on iOS and Android. Almost without mat</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Year I deliberately abstained from buying a tablet.  During this year, I seriously thought about buying it 3 times to replace a laptop while traveling and other cases where the computer is inconvenient, but you need to be able to solve work issues. <br><br>  And every time I stuck with the same problem.  I either could use all the SaaS services I needed from a mobile phone, or they were uncritical for me.  Except for one - Google.Docs. <a name="habracut"></a>  And since for some reason (partly related to work, partly purely objective), I use a service from Google to store and edit documents, this factor was critical.  The only seemingly unimportant, software, in no way limited by the capabilities of the operating systems themselves and a piece of hardware, a factor.  But he crossed out all the other advantages of tablet mobility for me. <br><br>  For a whole year, the tablets were beckoning, but in fact they were useless to me.  Without color, without taste, without smell ... Until Yuppy appeared.

      The life-giving drink has become very simple both in terms of creation and in terms of using the SaaS service - cloudHQ, which among other things allows you to synchronize Google documents with Dropbox.  More on this later, but for now about the sad. <br><br>  The sad humor of the story is that even a year ago there were no obstacles to the emergence of such an opportunity.  But it was: <br>  1. The official Google Docs app for Android, which can not do anything but show a list of your files. <br>  2. Mobile browser version of Google Docs, in which a change of more than 100 characters of the file caused a headache and a strong desire to break the phone against the wall. <br>  3. Several office applications for phones that are maximum at what they were capable of ‚Äî in the presence of the Internet, make the necessary changes to the file.  Also not without swearing. <br>  4. One rather poor application that could open Google documents and offline, but did not have an acceptable file editor. <br><br>  By combining all this, in general, it was possible to use the document service.  But only the strongest 80-level elves with iron emmunity were capable of any computer perversions. <br><br>  I also had to grind my teeth when I looked at tablet users with black envy, recalling the only reason I couldn‚Äôt use their mobility. <br><br>  3 days ago I found out about cloudHQ.  The next day after I saw the service in action, I without hesitation bought an Android tablet. <br><br>  The idea is simple.  If you can't use Google Docs directly, you can sync Google documents with Dropbox.  For tablets and smartphones it works as follows.  Install Dropbox on your device and in a few clicks you set up its synchronization with your Google account on the <a href="http://cloudhq.net/">cloudHQ</a> website.  You can edit documents with any mobile office application.  CloudHQ takes care that your Dropbox folder is always synchronized with your Google account. <br><br>  For complete mobility and the ability to manage your documents without going online, I installed Dropsync.  The application allows you to store current copies of files on your mobile device without the need to download each one manually. <br><br>  I‚Äôm not sure that this particular cloudHQ feature will be very popular in the future (I still hope that Google will finally release something that will allow their service to be used in their operating system), but in general the direction of cloudHQ is correct.  Such services help to solve simple, but critical business problems of tablets and manage their digital world without being tied to a specific piece of hardware. <br><br>  Thanks to them, I can say: today I had a working day without a laptop, and the tablet did an excellent job with most of my work tasks. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/132839/">https://habr.com/ru/post/132839/</a></p>
