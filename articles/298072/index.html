    <br>  The essence of the social phishing method is very simple.  When a user enters the site, an invisible layer (frame) is loaded, on which the Like button from the social button is located.  Vkontakte network.  Therefore, instead of the usual cursor, you see a finger.  Here is this: <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/b15/cde/049/b15cde0497f2c87df06e35f0a8411be0.png" alt="1451779195_024" width="17" height="19"></a>  This is a sign that you hover over a button or link. <br><br>  When you click anywhere on the site, you will find yourself in the invisible Like button.  Thus, your profile is determined in Vkontakte and your data is transferred to the ‚Äúgray‚Äù service. <br><br>  The idea that you can get data without the consent of the visitor, says a lot about this method. <br><br><br><blockquote>  We communicated with the representatives of Vkontakte on the topic of social phishing.  They claim that they will block access to sites that use this technology.  Now Yandex has joined the fight against social phishing.  We fully support this. </blockquote><br><br><br><h2>  How Carrot Quest defines soc.  user profiles? </h2><br>  <a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/%3Futm_source%3Dmegam%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_campaign%3Dsocfishing"><b>Carrot Quest</b></a> is a service that knows all the information about each user on your site and with this knowledge allows you to increase the conversion to the first and repeated sale (via chat, pop-up or email). <br><br>  When a user enters an email on a site, we do what any Internet user can do - we search for this email in open sources.  Just do it automatically and sooo fast. <br><br>  For example, if you received a request from the site, you can take the user's email and enter it in the search on Facebook.  He will show you a user profile with this email: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/1e2/6b9/ee8/1e26b9ee8b1379430bcc23b639e54065.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><br><br>  We do this automatically and load the data into the user card. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/5bb/8db/1fe/5bb8db1fe37bed9a14f0cc2ab7c96a82.png" alt="image"><br><br><br><br>  If the user does not make a targeted action (does not indicate his email address), then neither you nor Carrot Quest will know anything about this user from public sources. <br><br>  And yes, alas (or fortunately), in such a way not to find users who have banned access to their data.  We are convinced that this is correct. <br><br><br><h2>  Here is one of our reactions to social phishing. </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/d11/12f/2f7/d1112f2f7e2977ec38e1840941f29717.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><br><h2>  The official position of Yandex </h2><br>  <a href="">How clickjacking affects ranking</a> <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúRecently, the number of sites using clickjacking technology has increased - a mechanism of fraud related to the placement of invisible elements on the site, the interaction with which the user performs without suspecting it. <br><br>  A typical example of clickjacking is the creation of invisible elements on the site over buttons, forms, videos, etc.  You can also use the movement of these invisible elements after the cursor on the page.  Any click on the page, for example, to play an attractive video, leads to an imperceptible for the user to perform any action on an external site.  That is, the user, without knowing it, performs the action that the attacker needs. <br><br>  Cheating users with the help of clickjacking, fraudsters often try to cheat likes and subscriptions on social networks.  Worse, such a mechanism, if its work is not blocked by means of a browser or a website, is also used to obtain confidential personal data from social networks and then use them to the detriment of the user. <br><br>  For example, a user unwittingly can add to the group an attacker in the social network.  After that, the attacker will automatically determine the user account and be able to use the data from it (for example, phone) for their own purposes.  This is how intrusive ads appear when a site manager unexpectedly calls you, on which you did not leave your contact details. <br><br>  We are convinced that such methods of cheating users do not correspond to their interests, therefore sites using clickjacking can be ranked lower. ‚Äù </blockquote><br><br>  Be careful.  With pleasure, the team of <a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/%3Futm_source%3Dmegam%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_campaign%3Dsocfishing">Carrot Quest</a> service, who knows all the information about each user on your site and with this knowledge in mind, allows you to increase the conversion to the first and repeated sale (via chat, pop-up or email). <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298072/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298072/</a></p>
