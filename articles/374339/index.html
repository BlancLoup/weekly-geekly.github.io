In the "Russian LinkedIn" at the moment 1886 users are registered. <br><br>  The head of the department Vsevolod Vukolov (pictured) recalled that LinkedIn social network was blocked by Roskomnadzor on the territory of the Russian Federation for non-compliance with the requirements for the storage of personal data of Russians.  But the need for such a social network exists.  And so the agency launched a social network Skillsnet.ru.

      "This is the best social network for professional contacts, and, in our opinion, it will be actively demanded by young people," the official said.  Later, a mobile application and instant messenger will be added to the portal.  All work on these large projects are carried out <a href="https://zakupki.kontur.ru/0173100008517000084">at the expense of the federal budget</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The site allows you to find and track job vacancies with employers.  At the moment, the database contains 24,795 proposals from 510,199 employers (the main part of employers are only registered, but have not published vacancies), as well as two educational institutions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bc3/3f4/39d/bc33f439d3abda327069ef8595ace897.png"><br><br>  According to the official, the resource will be in demand both by young people and by older people.  Young people will open their profile here, and large and medium-sized enterprises will post job offers and internships.  Also, participants of the social network will have the opportunity to exchange information about where it is better to work, study and train. <br><br>  Judging by the <a href="https://skillsnet.ru/status/">open statistics</a> , the server on Nginx copes with handling up to 90 requests per second, uptime for several hours. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/y3/id/zm/y3idzmxwoklszqbe9ktznqmtxis.png"><br><br>  Vsevolod Vukolov stressed that Rostrud is actively introducing electronic technologies in the field of employment.  Unemployed Russians are now much easier and faster to find a job.  In particular, now workers and employers are actively using the online service <a href="https://xn--80akibcicpdbetz7e2g.xn--p1ai/">Onlayninspektsiya.rf</a> - by this time more than 200 thousand requests have been reviewed and more than 70 thousand online consultations have been provided.  This resource allows you to contact the labor inspectorate, get a free consultation on labor relations issues or conduct a self-check of your organization. <br><br>  There is also an all-Russian job base <a href="https://trudvsem.ru/">‚ÄúJobs in Russia‚Äù</a> , which is also very popular among Russians: ‚ÄúWe are trying to make the portal comfortable, understandable, and contain current information,‚Äù <a href="http://tass.ru/opinions/interviews/5025372">said</a> Vsevolod Vukolov.  - The Work in Russia portal contains information on employers, job seekers, vacancies (as of February 10, 2018, more than 1.2 million vacancies), job seekers (about 550 thousand people), investment projects implemented in the regions of the Russian Federation, programs increase mobility, as well as on living and working conditions in various regions.  Since its launch, the portal has been visited by more than 44 million unique users, and over 600 million hits have been registered. ‚Äù <br><br>  Now, on the basis of the Work in Russia portal, it is planned to create a special data-mining service for forecasting the labor market based on the data contained in the system.  The basic version is expected to appear by the end of this year.  This futurological service will help to extrapolate current trends to the future - and will help young people to find out which specialties will be in demand in the market in a few years. <br><br>  Another project Rostrud - mobile application <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.inspector.mobile%26hl%3Dru">"I am an inspector</a> . <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.inspector.mobile%26hl%3Dru">"</a>  Following the example of well-known services of the RosYam type, each citizen using the application can take a picture of the violation of labor protection requirements in one of the proposed thematic categories, add photo materials with comments - and then send the appeal to the state labor inspectorate. <br><br>  This year, the functionality of the application has expanded: there are new categories in which people can complain.  They are listed below: <br><br><ul><li>  "Delayed wages" </li><li>  ‚ÄúWage deductions made‚Äù </li><li>  ‚ÄúOvertime work, work on weekends and non-working days are not paid‚Äù </li><li>  "The employer pays less than stipulated by labor law" </li></ul><br>  ‚ÄúAfter the addition of the wage themes, the application became more popular and only gaining popularity,‚Äù Vsevolod Vukolov said.  ‚ÄúAt the moment, the application is used by more than 10,000 people.‚Äù  We add that the average rating of the application in the Android Market is 2.9.  This is one of the best indicators among all mobile applications released by government agencies. <br><br><blockquote>  <b><a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/299063/">Best comment</a></b> <br>  ‚ÄúIt would be better to have made Russian PornHub with integrated state services‚Äù <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/dvlbug/" class="user_link">Dvlbug</a> </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/374339/">https://habr.com/ru/post/374339/</a></p>
