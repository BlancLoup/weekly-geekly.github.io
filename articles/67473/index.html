  <section class="page js-page"><h1>An experienced contact center operator for 300 hours. Blitz guide</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  So, you have your own small (tiny, huge, you have not even dreamed of such a scale) contact center for which people are recruited.  Each of them has at least five years of experience, the right diction, a decent vocabulary - and, in general, you just want to pray to your newly appeared operators.  In that case, let me congratulate you and envy you with black envy. <br><br>  Our company has turned out a little differently.  People came - young, seemingly energetic, polite, benevolent, and ... that's all.  We do not know how to talk with clients, ‚Äúagakay‚Äù, ‚Äúshock‚Äù, ‚Äúnukayem‚Äù, whispering into the phone so that none of the more experienced operators will hear <s>what kind of mess we are trying to push</s> what we are trying to inform the client under the guise of consultation. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And it's not so bad.  A month later, in practice, they mastered the basic techniques of business communication over the phone with customers (yes, a few weeks away, what to do?), But with pronunciation and diction the problem was still acute. <br><br>  By trial and error, the main stumbling blocks were identified: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
    <ul><li>  We begin a conversation with the client cheerfully, after a couple of phrases we begin to ‚Äústumble‚Äù in the sentence.  So, not enough breath. </li><li>  Some sounds due to imperfect articulation are not clearly pronounced. </li><li>  Sounds are swallowed in words with complex combinations of consonants. </li><li>  We talk too quietly, practically whispering. </li></ul><br><br>  By simple googling, a wonderful site was found, pleasantly surprised by the adequacy and effectiveness of the exercises collected on it.  I recommend - <a href="http://technics-speech.ru/">technics-speech.ru</a> . <br>  At first we did all the exercises, then we reduced the program, leaving the most effective ones.  In particular, due to workload, it was not every day that it turned out to allocate two hours of working time exclusively for training. <br><br>  The first exercises went tight - now and then our guys would punch on ‚Äúha-ha‚Äù, they were all amused.  Until they were given to listen to the recording of their "bleating" on the phone.  Their faces were gloomy, their eyelids dropped sadly - and at the next training session they were more restrained.  By the way!  When performing exercises for training the main organs of speech, the main thing for a trainer is to make a very serious smart face.  It would not be superfluous to offer the wards to "practice" at the same time and with their eyes closed - so they will be less embarrassed, shy and giggle. <br><br>  Progress was noticed after a week, especially for non-smokers. <br><br>  As a homework interns were given tongue twisters, which, as it turned out, our almost everything.  At first, of course, the wards cried, injected, but continued <s>to eat the cactus to</s> break the tongue.  After two or three weeks, even a girl with a charming Ukrainian ‚Äúhekane‚Äù began to speak much more correctly. <br><br>  More tongue twisters, good and necessary, can be found, for example, here - <a href="http://www.kaplya.ic.km.ua/scorogov.html">www.kaplya.ic.km.ua/scorogov.html</a> <br>  After such training, the exercises that allow to solve the problem with difficult-to-pronounce combinations of consonants, have been passed, as they say, ‚Äúwith a bang.‚Äù <br><br>  And finally, the final chord - voice development training.  The main obstacle was not even the shyness of the trainees, but the attention that we attracted with our noise effects.  Therefore, if you have the opportunity to take a separate room for training, we recommend using this gift of heaven. <br><br>  As a result, over the course of a month, our operators finally began to talk on the phone in the way that we wanted - clearly, loudly, clearly.  Hallelujah, brothers and sisters. <br><br>  We hope that you will not encounter such difficulties that we have experienced and successfully eliminated.  But if fate will still send you raw clay in the form of operators with indistinct diction, know that you can fashion Galatea from it.  Even if you are not Pygmalion :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/67473/">https://habr.com/ru/post/67473/</a></p>
