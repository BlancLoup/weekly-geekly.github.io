    <h3>  purpose </h3><br>  Let's start with the lyrics, the most important thing when planning exam preparation, is to set a goal.  Properly plan your preparation schedule, put your personal affairs away somewhere far away if you are a family man, be sure to prepare your family for the fact that the husband and the father become ¬Ω from the current head of the family for a while. <br><br>  Once upon a time, the JNCIE-SP exam was for me something not attainable. <br><br>  I listened, horrible stories about people who went to the exam 3.4 times and could not pass, terrified of these stories, I moved further and further away from the goal.  Looking at them, repeating to myself that if such giants cannot surrender, then how can I.  In contrast, I observed specialists who passed and passed expert exams, and their result inspired me, and I understood that if they succeeded, then I would succeed.  One of these gurus, is Denis Zuev - he proved by his surrender that nothing is possible.  Therefore, do not rely on anyone, as in the film ‚ÄúSet a goal, achieve and end‚Äù <br><br><h3>  Preparation Stage # 1 </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/q0/--/fb/q0--fbax1bf7tewxlkyb-grgxwm.jpeg"><br>  <i>Figure 2 - keep calm</i> <br><br>  From the lyrics go, to practical rules that will help conduct the preparation of the most useful. <br><br>  <b>Rule # 1 - Timing</b> <br><br>  Decide for yourself how much, in total per week you will be able to allocate for training and divide these hours in proportion to 7 days per week. <br><br>  For example, I started from the mondragon article and planned 16 hours a week.  True, these 16 hours I proportionally divided, did not work.  It was different for me, everything depended on the amount of work, if there was a small load at work, I used working time, so I could prepare 5 hours on Monday, and on Tuesday, and I had a huge load on work on Wednesday, which accounted for work late and tired, I did not begin to prepare, afraid of poorly assimilate the material.  In the end, it could have happened that on Monday I was studying for 5 hours, Tuesday 0, Wednesday 0, Thursday 2 hours, Friday 2, Saturday 2 hours, and 4 hours on Sunday.  The training schedule was floating, but the most basic rule worked, I prepared the required 16 hours a week.  In this case, I still advise you to break more, less proportionally, with intensive preparation at the weekend.  Of all the above, a very important piece of advice, the rules of 16 hours of preparation per week, should always work, regardless of national holidays, birthdays, holidays, and so on.  Otherwise, with our rich Russian soul and love for the holidays, it will be very difficult to prepare.  By the way, before the second attempt, to prepare, I was not prevented by a vacation in GOA. <br><br>  <b>Rule number 2 - Material</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bl/hk/tq/blhktqruhbugeisj7mh6myt8lcc.jpeg"><br>  <i>Figure 3 - InetZero lab guides</i> <br><br>  As you figure out rule number one, you need to move on to the next item.  You need to gather all the material for preparation and plan what and how much you will decide and read.  Consider first the practical materials, I enjoyed the following: <br><br><ol><li>  InetZero Technology Focused workbook </li><li>  InetZero Lab workbook with detailed solution </li><li>  InetZero Full Scale Labs volume 1.2 </li><li>  JNCIE-SP Bootcamp lab guide </li></ol> <br>  Consider them in the order in which I advise them to study. <br><br>  A) InetZero Technology Focused workbook <br><br>  This book is the base.  Preparation for JNCIE-SP is sure, you should start with this book.  It contains all possible topics and they are considered in order of complexity.  I would advise you to solve this book twice, not paying attention to the super lab.  The first time for an acquaintance, the second time no longer peeping into the answers, and only after setting to verify the results.  At the end of this book there is a super lab, many have advised me to solve it for a while, but I will advise you back, you can go through it, but no more than once and solve it for a while, I categorically would not advise.  This book should be used for the study / repetition of all possible designs and technologies. <br><br>  B) InetZero Lab workbook with detailed solution <br><br>  With this book, things are a little different, there are a lot of interesting tasks that can help to understand the wording of the tasks on the exam and how to solve, some tasks are complicated and move away from reality.  It is quite enough to go through the book once, although of course it is not forbidden to go through again to fix the material. <br><br>  C) InetZero Full Scale Labs volume 1.2 <br><br>  These books appeared on sale closer to my first attempt, but still I decided to study them.  The books themselves sometimes contain very difficult formulations and perverted tasks.  That is, there seems to be a technology, it seems to configure it this way, but at the same time, the author wants you to do this with a very crutch method.  But I liked the detailed explanation in the answers, each step was disassembled and contained a bunch of explanations. <br><br>  In the previous books listed, sometimes this explanation is not enough.  I advise this book (in two volumes) to be solved once, for sure.  The complex formulation of the tasks and the methods used for the solution will help you to more flexibly reason over the solution of problems and will facilitate your further decoding of the tasks on the exam itself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9b/n2/v3/9bn2v3np7mswqwfefuno6ir3lbg.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Figure 4 - JNCIE Bootcamp books</i> <br><br>  D) JNCIE-SP Bootcamp lab guide <br><br>  Of course, you cannot prepare for the Juniper exam without using the book of their own publication.  I would advise you to visit Bootcamp in Poplar itself, you will take more advantage of it.  But since, often, the employer is not ready to pay, and to pay 120 thousand himself is not always realistic.  Actually, the course itself in Polar, is held only once a year.  It is quite possible to find a Buckamp in the network; we solve this book at the very end.  Those who longed to solve the laboratory for a while, your time has come.  Be sure to go through several tasks on all topics, and for a snack to train with super-weak.  It is better to solve it for a while, and repeat it several times. <br><br>  For completeness, it is impossible not to mention that to study the theory I advise everyone to use the official student guide and official documentation posted on the Juniper website. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0d/9n/t-/0d9nt-2svzxrthvtnb8gwgdynrq.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>Figure 5 - Unetlab Virtual Environment</i> <br><br>  <b>Rule number 3 - Laboratory stand</b> <br><br>  Actually, the selected material with the tasks, you need somewhere to solve.  I did my training on Unetlab, so it turned out that I did some laboratory work on EVE-NG.  The fundamental difference, I did not see, both virtual environments are suitable for training.  Technical requirements, for a full preparation, I would advise 128 GB of RAM, although 64 GB can also be enough.  I began to prepare on images of vMX version 14.1.R1, here I would caution against using vMX in preparation for JNCIE-SP.  I want to advise you to carry out training mixed up, when on vSRX, and when on vMX.  On vMX, QOS is not supported, and on vSRX, L2 LDP VPN is not supported.  By the way, starting to prepare for Unetlab and the old version of vMX did not work for me and the LAG interfaces, besides this, I occasionally had mac interfaces, I didn‚Äôt find this problem in the vMX 14.1.R1 and EVE-NG image .  In order for vSRX to work as a router you need to do 4 actions: <br><br><pre><code class="hljs pgsql"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">Delete</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">security</span></span> policies <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">Set</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">security</span></span> forwarding-<span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">options</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">family</span></span> inet6 mode packet-based <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">Set</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">security</span></span> forwarding-<span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">options</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">family</span></span> iso mode packet-based <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">Set</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">security</span></span> forwarding-<span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">options</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">family</span></span> mpls mode packet-based</code> </pre> <br>  Regarding the build and purchase of a physical server, I find it difficult to recommend something because I myself jumped from server to server, which my friends provided to me.  Therefore, for a more detailed description and advice of using the server for preparation, I will send to a friendly article, to the user <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/mondragon/" class="user_link">mondragon</a> . <br><br>  <b>Rule number 4 - Your environment</b> <br><br>  Now we have planned the time, picked up the material and found the equipment.  They sat down to read and perform assignments, periodically we encounter some errors in books or bugs in the lab, trying to figure it out.  Sometimes to understand some subtleties of setting up a complex architecture.  This is all well and good, but there is often a lack of a person with whom you could discuss your successes, some configuration problems, or try to sort out a complex topic together.  I knowingly made this rule 4 point, rule number 4 is in last place in importance.  It is not always possible to find people who are just as obsessed with the idea.  But to go forward, it is easier not alone.  My initial training went along with my friend, we urged each other, we examined the topics together.  There was a certain enthusiasm and additional motivation, not to be left behind each other.  In the rule number 4, I advised to find people close in spirit and prepare jointly.  Fulfillment of this rule will make training more productive and will give additional motivation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sr/r6/vv/srr6vv9dkaqns4sgk0vqqqpokqs.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Figure 6 - In the plane of the company Aeroflot, before taking off to the city of Amsterdam.</i> <br><br><h3>  A trip to the country of tulips </h3><br>  So my 6 months of preparation flew by, I would even say quickly and I did not feel any particular fatigue.  Last week before passing the exam, I tried to unload myself as much as possible at work and repeat all the topics as much as possible.  The exam was scheduled for Monday in Amsterdam, I flew out on Sunday morning and in the afternoon I was already in Amsterdam, according to my plan after arrival I didn‚Äôt repeat anything, but I just got enough sleep and rest.  Consider in order all the cases that will find the networker who is planning to take the exam. <br><br>  A) Visa - To get a visa to Amsterdam is quite easy, costing a total of about 5 thousand.  Regular Schengen visa, you go to the visa center website, register, select the date and time of submission of documents.  There you will find the documents that you need.  Here I would emphasize such advice that to make a visa in advance, a little red tape with documents distracts from preparation, so I would not advise you to do this in the final stages of preparation. <br>  B) The week before the exam - before the first attempt, I did not take time off, but since I unloaded myself at the workplace as much as possible, and on Saturday I had a good sleep, I did not feel any particular fatigue in the exam.  Here I would give such advice, a week before the exams to take a vacation and devote preparation, while sleeping enough, one day before the exam nothing is repeated, try to calmly spend the day and go to bed early to sleep.  It is better to fly a day or two before the exam, so that there is time for acclimatization. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uj/he/20/ujhe20e2md0swibywq1bfpdcz2g.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Figure 7 - View from the Western Plus Amedia Hotel Amsterdam Airport</i> <br><br>  D) Hotel - Juniper itself is located near the airport, as my friend calls it "industrial zone", respectively, some shops are quite difficult to find there, and in general there it is very quiet and peaceful.  Since, apart from Juniper, there are many other it companies, hotels are in demand.  There are really many hotels there, it was a certain dilemma to choose a hotel.  A list of all hotels can be found on the Juniper website, we stayed at the Best Western Plus Amedia Amsterdam Airport hotel, for those who give Juniper, I would recommend this hotel.  The hotel is located opposite the Juniper headquarters and it seemed to us cheaper than the rest.  The rooms themselves, comfortable, which seemed to me an additional advantage in the rest before the exam.  All hotels in this ‚Äúindustrial zone‚Äù can be reached by free buses from the airport.  Photo above, such a view was from the window. <br>  D) Flight - everyone flies in different ways, of course everyone is trying to take a cheaper ticket.  The exam itself, and so it goes a lot of money, there are options to go with one transfer and it is quite possible to invest thousands in 14. I took, the usual is not a return ticket, for 18 thousand, but it had one advantage - I had luggage.  Believe me, at first I thought that this is a useless option and I just did not want to get tired of flights, but in the end, when you fly back with souvenirs, this baggage will be very useful. <br><br><h3>  Passing the exam JNCIE-SP attempt number 1 </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ly/8-/67/ly8-670aa3mirrszxqs2v87kzhg.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Figure 8 - Information plate near the audience for the delivery of JNCIE</i> <br><br>  In this chapter, I will tell everything that does not fall under the NDA, for obvious reasons.  The plan was to get up in the morning, have a good breakfast and go to the exam in advance.  This plan was successfully executed, we met Proctor, he opened an audience for us, where he said to get everything that is possible except for a passport and put it in this room.  Take with you nothing.  In order to say nothing extra that falls under the NDA, I will list all the tips that will help you. <br><br><ol><li>  Drink coffee, as much as possible coffee. </li><li>  Do not worry, the most dangerous, if you are overwhelmed with anxiety or come the feeling that these tasks are too hard for you.  You have been preparing for a long time and have studied all the topics, if you have completed all the training manuals, then you should not have uncovered topics that you could not solve.  Therefore, be confident in yourself and your decisions. </li><li>  Do not linger, if you feel that you are starting to get tired, then do not continue, thinking now, I will add one more policy and then rest.  Having made a mistake in something not difficult from fatigue, you may very well spoil your nerves in the future.  Therefore, do my advice consistently, but if suddenly you feel tired to get up and walk, to the coffee maker, to the toilet.  No matter, you will come with a more fresh look. </li><li>  If you forget the sequence of some settings, it does not matter.  Open the documentation on your work computer and see how to properly configure. </li></ol><br>  Moving from tips to narration, the exam itself lasts 8 hours, with a lunch break.  Dinner takes you all to the dining room, where you can get whatever you want.  I only had no appetite at lunch, so I can say, and did not eat.  At lunch, you can safely communicate on any topic that does not concern labs.  Also during the entire time of the exam, you will have free access to the coffee machine, various sweets and drinks.  After leaving the exam, I already knew that a second attempt would be needed.  Unfortunately, the first attempt was not successful.  When we drove to another hotel, closer to the center, I analyzed the entire past day, tried to work on errors in my head.  I understood one thing, that the problem was more psychologically, I was well prepared.  But when I saw the tasks, I was very confused and ran from one task to another, made many mistakes that were superimposed on one another and could not be cleared.  The result was waiting for about a week, the result was expected, fail.  <i>Well, well, and Moscow was not built right away.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/48/i2/ru/48i2rub9qg0rxfdjcnem_9mexgk.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Figure 9 - Juniper office, street view</i> <br><br><h3>  Preparation Stage 2 </h3><br>  The first week after I learned the result, many questions arose.  My opinion changed very often, the main dilemma was to go two months later in Moscow and continue training, or postpone preparation for a month.  If you make a pause in preparation for a month, then the change would accordingly take place much later in Amsterdam, which would entail additional costs.  After some thought, I realized that if not now, then never.  The second wave of training began almost immediately, a week of reflection and on weekends, I was already sitting at the computer.  By the way, I understand why they say that the more attempts there are, the more knowledge you have emphasized.  After an unsuccessful exam, I looked at all the topics in a new way and the designs that were not so easy for me before the first attempt were already so clear and simple.  But the difference is only 3 weeks, mysticism, not otherwise.  This training was already easier, I knew my weak points, which should be emphasized, I knew the tasks in which I had difficulties.  It was more difficult to force myself to study, but there was only more motivation to prove to everyone and myself that you could do it.  In general, the preparation process differed decently.  I did not plan the time anymore, I presented in my head a clear picture of the topics that need to be repeated or pulled up to the next attempt.  After that, I just woke up and planned that I must disassemble it today.  As a result, it passed, everything was ahead of schedule and I had to deliberately slow down at the end. <br><br><h3>  Errors made before the second attempt </h3><br>  Actually, this is how 2.5 months of preparation passed, by coincidence, two weeks before the exam, I took a vacation and flew to GOA.  I will not explain the reason for this act, I will say the following from this.  The training at GOA was very fruitful, I didn‚Äôt have to think about anything, I slept enough, rested.  While in Moscow the first frosts came, GOA was sunny and the working capacity was higher.  I clearly planned a period of time, which I will allocate every day for preparation.  Delays in the preparation were insane, about 250-300 ms.  But I did not pay attention to it and continued to prepare.  Actually, since the chapter is called ‚Äúmistakes,‚Äù then there must be minuses somewhere, I will list them: <br><br><ol><li>  After coming back to Moscow all week you will undergo acclimatization, which may manifest itself in excessive tiredness. </li><li>  The difference in time, after arrival - will need to be rebuilt at another time, it will also affect your ability to work </li><li>  If you, as a potential expert, enjoy spending your vacation to study, then your family is not at all happy about how you spend your time on a laptop instead of spending time with them.  In my case, of course I was lucky, my family supported me. </li></ol><br>  The truth is that there is one clear advantage, because of such big delays, on the exam it seemed to me that there are no delays.  I noticed them hours after 4, when I was tired decently, but before that everything seemed perfect. <br><br>  In this chapter I want to give advice on how to behave immediately before the exam. <br><br><ol><li>  Best of all is the last week before the exam, take a vacation and spend 5 days out of 7 days in preparation, the last two days have a good rest and try to do a little gymnastics to repeat some important settings, but no more. </li><li>  Sleep enough. </li><li>  The day before the Amsterdam exam, I hardly slept.  Although I wanted to sleep well, but waiting for the next day, I was not allowed to fall asleep.  Before the second attempt I used supplements in the form of melatonin.  I found out about him, even when I worked on duty at the shift and now firmly decided that on arrival from GOA all week to normalize the schedule, I would drink it and fall asleep at 22.00.  Therefore, before the second attempt, I slept well. </li></ol><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cf/lo/l4/cflol4nsaqptaj6zkwlwbx-dpgc.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Figure 10 - Poplar Awards</i> <br><br><h3>  Passing the JNCIE-SP exam in the native Poplar, attempt number 2 </h3><br>  Actually, day X came, by the way, before the second attempt I worried much more.  Experienced experienced experts, said the point is that you have a third attempt on the horizon.  I thought about it for a long time, most likely yes, the fear of the third attempt puts pressure on you already more.  Let me give you organizational points that differed from the first attempt.  In Amsterdam, in addition to a laptop, there was a monitor, in Poplar, there was only a laptop, which can greatly hinder.  When you look at the monitor for about 8 hours, your eyes do not see the numbers and letters in a small monitor, and getting tangled in a figure is easier than ever.  In Moscow, for lunch we did not go anywhere, remained in the audience, which in principle is not bad.  I, as always, by tradition, had no appetite.  Somewhere at 13.00, I realized that I was tired.  Fatigue rolled like a snowball, it all happened very sharply.  Now I realized that it was not worth going to another continent, to undergo acclimatization, and the last week before the exam should not be overloaded.  By the way, the last week before the exam, I had a lot of work and I didn‚Äôt limit myself to preparation.  As soon as I felt this insane tiredness, I brewed myself a very strong coffee, with a lot of sugar, and continued the exam solution. <br>  Actually, I can highlight such tips here: do the tasks in order and not rush.  Do not go away from the problems for a long time, if you do not get distracted, something does not turn out to be a good idea, but not to leave this problem on the half of the exam otherwise it will not be able to get everything.  Actually, I finished it, I had 40 minutes earlier, called the proctor, took my things and went home.  While lying, not home to the bar =) <br><br><h3>  Happy end </h3><br>  The result must come no later than 5 business days.  When I left the exam, I was sure that I had not made a single mistake. <br><br>  Then every day, I received various doubts about errors, most of course, could be made due to fatigue.  It took 5 days and everyone who passed the day before me, got the result.  It seems to be simple mathematics, they passed it a day earlier, so tomorrow I should get a result too.  Specially turned on the loudest mode on all devices with mail notification, woke up during the night 3 times and looked at the mail.  There were no results.  It was here that the mad excitement began, if before that there was a little suspiciousness in some tasks, now I was sure that I had solved many tasks in completely different ways.  I am ashamed to admit, but a great panic began, although I occasionally calmed myself and repeated: "I will go for a third attempt, I will not surrender." <br>  But the scarecrow, in all this, is that you stand still and do not move on.  Already plans are born for further certification, and you remain in place.  Monday came and 9 days already, from the date of the exam, I decided to write wherever possible.  Wrote at all possible addresses in Juniper.  Two more days passed, and on Wednesday evening, I received a notification from Juniper, asking to follow the link.  I follow the link, I see a list of my attempts, my eyes swim from the experience, fail, pass, PASS !!!  I watched and could not believe it. <br><br>  I have had many victories in my life, but this one was kind of special.  I don‚Äôt even know if my certification will lead to salary increases and career growth, but I don‚Äôt regret it, my time and finances.  The skills obtained in the process of preparation and the joyful sensations of a positive result are worth it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rz/7w/3l/rz7w3l5l99viv2ekg518ta-nmae.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Figure 11 - JNCIE photo plaque</i> <br><br><h3>  Summarizing </h3><br>  Of course, the article would not be complete if I did not express my gratitude to the people who help me and support me.  First of all I wanted to thank my wife Antonina for her patience and support.  My parents - my mother and grandmother, for their support and faith in me.  Two Andrews, for help in preparing and moral support.  And to my friends, Igor and Roma, who also supported me and helped me deal with the material.  Yet, without all of you, I could not achieve it.  Also, the guys from the telegram and Poplar, represented by Leonid Mirenkov, raised more than one generation of JNCIE. <br><br>  To be continued.  Next-chapter JNCIE-DC, Denis Zuev, I am going to exceed your result. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lw/bq/sb/lwbqsbufkexe5epbzqtbsmiseaa.jpeg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/347924/">https://habr.com/ru/post/347924/</a></p>
