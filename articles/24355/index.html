  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Contract Search engine optimization</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> In continuation of the topic of contracts, I want to introduce you to the contract for SEO, which we use in our Internet agency. <br><br>  One of the key problems of the contract for SEO - for what actually take the money?  There are three main points of view.  1. for positions in the top 2. for traffic from search engines 3. for work as a whole. <br>  Taking money from customers for positions is an incorrect position for the optimizer.  Glitches search engine, changing the algorithm, the result of the work only after 2-3 months.  All this is not something that contributes to the profit organization.  In addition, this option excludes prepayment.  Bring in the top on competitive topics, investing money the company has no desire. <br>  The pay-per-visit option is more acceptable.  But again, what about the prepayment?  The first two months to work at the expense of their own budget, while there are few or no visitors? <br>  The third option - payment for the complex of works, the most interesting for a seo-company.  We do - this, this and this.  For the effect we are responsible for our experience, reputation, but not legally. <br>  For those who ask: ‚ÄúBut what about guarantees?‚Äù I will answer: there are no 100% guarantees and there can be no.  Optimizer as a farmer - plow the land, sow, fertilizer throws when necessary.  But there is no sense in demanding guarantees of a harvest from it - it depends too much on weather conditions (will Yandex red-sun warmer). <br>  The only thing that remains for the customer is to select more experienced farmers.  A better collective farm.  And look at previous yields (portfolio). <br>  And one more favorite example of me.  Everyone watched the transfer of "Cars for pumping" on MTV, where do tuning old cars?  So it‚Äôs the same with the site - the optimizer can pump it, force the engine, and if the car (site) gets into the top10 race - what are the guarantees? <br><br>  Now actually, the contract.  Some points will be commented below. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

Develop an algorithm for promoting the resource of the Customer using the keywords (phrases) specified in Table 1. <br>  2. To carry out a complex of works aimed at increasing the popularity of the Customer‚Äôs site in Internet search engines: <br>  2.1.1 Analysis of optimization problems existing on the Customer‚Äôs site and their elimination. <br>  2.1.2 Analysis of the competitive environment in this area. <br>  2.1.3 Recommendations for changing the texts posted on the site. <br>  2.1.4 Optimization of the page code. <br>  2.1.5 Compiling textual descriptions for directories, compiling links to be placed on third-party Internet resources. <br>  2.1.6 Registration of the Customer‚Äôs site in catalogs. <br>  2.1.7 Placing links to the customer's resource on other Internet sites. <br><br>  Table number 1 <br>  ‚Ññ p / p Keywords (phrases) <br>  one. <br>  2 <br>  3 <br>  four. <br>  five. <br>  6 ... <br><br>  <strong>Comments to some items:</strong> <br>  1.1.  Previously, we took a single amount for website promotion, regardless of the timing of the indicative output to the top.  Further for support - a monthly subscription fee.  Later, I refused such an option, going to a fixed amount per month.  As practice has shown, it is more convenient for both the optimizer and the client (less one-time payments).  But the division into stages remained. <br><br>  2.2.  We practice 100% prepayment per month.  Usually it does not bother anyone. <br><br>  2.3.  ‚ÄúThe contractor has the right to change the monthly cost of work unilaterally, but not earlier than 3 months from the date of signing this Agreement‚Äù - the cost of services may change due to objective reasons (the algorithm has changed, competitors have become more active, etc.).  3 months is an insurance period for a client; after this period in most projects, the results of the work are clearly visible.  If you change the cost in a month - the client will express bewilderment - and there is no result yet, and the price has already increased. <br>  Some companies in contracts make a clause to change the search engine algorithm, and therefore have the right to revise the terms of the contract.  From a legal point of view, this is incorrect, since it is almost impossible to prove that the algorithm has changed.  Previously, Yandex did not inform at all about this event.  Now a Yandex representative usually reports this on the forum <a href="http://forum.searchengines.ru/">forum.searchengines.ru</a> or on the social network wow.ya.ru.  Well, not to the forum to refer to in court, in fact. <br><br>  3.3.3.  "Do not interfere with the work of the Contractor and prevent third parties from interfering."  Obligatory item, although it is not enough, in my opinion, is painted in this contract.  Customers sometimes have an unexpected desire to change the text of the main page with keywords or change the structure / addressing of the site pages without notifying the optimizer. <br>  Another case of intervention (we already had such a case) is a virus on the part of the client.  He slips his code instead of a page, which then adversely affects his progress.  Removed - it appears again.  Or if the client has an unstable, constantly falling server, it is also not conducive to productive work.  Do you regulate such situations in your contracts? <br><br>  The contract is undoubtedly not customer-oriented.  It is focused on the studio.  Nevertheless, he is quite satisfied with the majority of clients.  He signed more than once, and went through the check of lawyers of fairly large companies. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/24355/">https://habr.com/ru/post/24355/</a></p>
