In Yekaterinburg and everywhere</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  My name is Denis Chistyakov, and I lead the interface development team in Yekaterinburg.  We are engaged in the front-end: we make a lot of complex, bright and beautiful pages for Yandex applications. <br><br>  Two years ago, we launched our Interface Development School, within which we are trying to turn web developers into cool web developers, ready for the specifics of our company, our infrastructure and our technologies, as soon as possible.  This year is no exception.  In 2014, <a href="http://bit.ly/shri-ekb_2014">SRI will be held in Yekaterinburg</a> and Minsk. <br><br>  Today I want to share with you the courses collected from the best lectures in our school in recent years, and also to tell about what will be in it in a new way.

      <br>
      This year we made a decision to move away from the School format that had become customary in two years and try to hold it in a completely new rhythm.  This year, the training will be divided into two parts, relatively speaking, full-time and part-time. <br><br> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/yandex/blog/240373/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1df/b84/6c0/1dfb846c0bf7438ab25514ddfc7d497a.png"></a> <br><br>  We understand that often those who want to learn from us find the time between study, work and family.  And we are not an ordinary school and not a university, where a mandatory presence in classes and couples is necessary.  We have the confidence that those people who get into SRI have a healthy excitement, are responsible and understand what they started the path of learning for.  (Yes, yes, we know you're cool :) <br><br>  Therefore, summarizing all of the above, we decided that students will master the theoretical material on their own at a convenient time for them.  But in order to get a taste of creating interfaces, there is little to read and watch.  You still need to practice a lot and code.  Therefore, the second - full-time - part of the training will be practical exercises (which, it is important to note, was not in the past SRI). <br><br>  These will be mini hackathons on which the guys will have to implement the whole project.  And a team of Yandex mentors will help them in this.  And there are many advantages in this: communication, the opportunity to work side by side with the professionals, get a ‚Äúliving experience‚Äù and, most importantly, try to feel like a part of Yandex. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  What else?  There will also be a story about teamwork.  Very often, the success of your product depends on the coordinated work of many people.  Cool if you can do everything yourself, but more often it is a bit more complicated.  It is clear that to get the skill of working in a team without a team is quite a difficult task.  Therefore, during practical classes, we will also pay attention to this aspect.  Students will be able to invent, plan, negotiate, build the architecture of their own project and choose technologies for implementation.  We'll have to make decisions and be responsible for the finished product.  And it is in this format, with such innovations, we start this year. <br><br>  Now I would like to elaborate a little more on the course of lectures, which was mentioned above. <br><br>  I repeat, we really have a lot of high-quality material from experienced developers, who, besides being really cool specialists, prepared specifically for speaking to students, thought through the content of each lecture to tell the most useful things.  And the greatest value of all this baggage material is that it is in the public domain.  Everyone can independently in the free mode to get acquainted with it, even without studying at the School. <br><br>  In the process of selecting materials for home study, we tried to select not just the best, but the most valuable and useful.  As a result, we got a course of video lectures, which will help anyone who wants to immerse themselves in web development. <br><br><h3>  Course Structure <br></h3><br>  We divided all the material into three blocks, in accordance with the development cycle: this is the layout, the ‚Äúrevitalization‚Äù of our pages by JS, and the block about rolling out and optimization.  On the one hand, each lecture is filled with selected information on the topic and the course provides a good base.  On the other hand, each block should be perceived as the anchor points of what you need to know.  After viewing the lecture, you need to take something and try to do it yourself, somewhere we recommend references and additional sources for studying. <br><br>  The course is also useful for novice developers who are just taking the first steps in this really cool business, and for those who already have some experience.  With it, you can both get new knowledge and find answers to your questions, and simply structure the already existing material in your head. <br><br>  The list of lectures appeared for a reason.  Lectures are held in the same order in which the development process usually takes place: static layout, javascript hooking, then debugging and code testing.  For two years we have read and recorded several courses in different cities, and this compilation, in my opinion, is the most successful for the purposes of training.  I chose the most concise and informative lectures so that the student could get an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe whole development process, and then, if desired, go into details and watch other lectures. <br><br><h2>  Layout: HTML + CSS <br></h2><br>  In the work on any interface project we can‚Äôt get away from the layout.  Now the HTML and CSS technologies have gone very far, and many cool and even animated pieces can be implemented already at this stage of development, even without touching the JS. <br><br>  In this block we put nine lectures telling about everything necessary for the layout of the layout: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://tech.yandex.ru/education/shri/ekb-2013/talks/1363/">introductory lecture on HTML markup language</a> , history of its creation and development, as well as on basic tags;
