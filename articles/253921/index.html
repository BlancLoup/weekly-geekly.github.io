This is about 6 screens of text, if you put them all in one table.  The organizers asked me, as an experienced Habro-browser, to evaluate these applications.

      It is clear that in these usability I am like a pig in oranges, and therefore I looked at the applications with my amateur bell tower.  I was interested in the following: I noticed a long time ago that applications for performances are of particular value because they show the <s>average temperature in a hospital as a</s> cut of the industry at a particular point in time.  And perhaps this is true for any professional conference: people say exactly what hurts, what you want to talk about, as a topic.  No matter what area they work. <br><br>  Below is a brief overview of applications for speaking at Profsoux 15. For convenience, I have divided them into thematic blocks. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Traditional UX Techniques </h5><br>  Part of the application is devoted to new approaches or a deeper consideration of traditional for UX techniques: user research, design, UX testing. <br><ul><li>  How do you actually search for information and make decisions? </li><li>  What to do with the ever-increasing information noise? </li><li>  How to conduct testing with minimal cost or just one respondent? </li><li>  How not to waste time and design in the subway, on napkins and even in the sand? </li></ul><br>  Based on their experience, speakers are ready to answer these questions to conference participants. <br><br>  Here are some of the applications of this block: <br><ul><li>  Usability Testing for 10 000 rubles </li><li>  Thorny path of decision making </li><li>  Information Persons (as people search for information) </li><li>  When is one respondent enough? </li><li>  The boiling point of the brain - protecting the user from information overload </li><li>  People against Panteleimon </li><li>  Acceleration of the prototyping process </li><li>  Using the Symbol function in Balsamiq Mockup </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f0a/9f9/c10/f0a9f9c10b154c7f91269122e0b890bf.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Processes </h5><br>  Many applications are devoted to the organization of the workflow UX-specialist.  How to build relationships with customers and colleagues?  How to prioritize tasks?  How to become a leader?  About the interaction of designers and designers, the misconceptions of young professionals and the understanding of the business not as work, but as art, the UX experts want to talk this year. <br><br><ul><li>  10 misconceptions romantics from UX </li><li>  UX-ninja path.  Interface between designer and business </li><li>  How to get the truth from the user and the juice from the manager </li><li>  Site system.  Creation, development and interconnection of the organization‚Äôs web resources with a complex structure of departments. </li><li>  Design process for large projects </li><li>  UX specialists: passion and hate in a team </li><li>  Designing both technology and art </li><li>  UX to manual: 12 errors, 6 lifehacks </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6aa/cef/a4d/6aacefa4d9814b8f880b7451f69d6734.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Everywhere has its own specifics </h5><br>  Another conditional block of applications can be combined with the words "Everywhere has its own specifics."  Different devices, customers, products and end users require a special approach.  Experts working with Smart TV, mobile games, emails, sophisticated systems for professionals (shipbuilding, medicine ...) and even self-service cash registers offer their experience.  How to design for ‚Äúgeeks‚Äù and is there a design in B2B? <br><ul><li>  UX for Geeks </li><li>  On the same wavelength with the user.  We design letters </li><li>  B2B design </li><li>  Smart TVs are getting smarter </li><li>  In spite of the screen </li><li>  UI design features of large systems for professional users </li><li>  The path of the product.  From business goal to implementation. </li><li>  Application icons: how to do them not beautifully, but correctly </li><li>  Features of the design of mobile games </li></ul><br><br><h5>  Adjacent areas </h5><br>  Another series of speakers wants to ‚Äúlook at the world more widely‚Äù and invite participants to pay attention to related specialties.  Experts will equip students with an arsenal of business analysts, explain what programmer techniques can be applied in work and how to go all the way with the product from idea to the final, make friends with marketing and teach how to analyze the market and apply KPI business. <br><ul><li>  Interface Designer = business analyst = system analyst? </li><li>  Designer / designer and programmer - sworn friends! </li><li>  How to read the prototype correctly: transition from UX to UI design </li><li>  Whether UX is measured by conversion, or a few words about marketing in design </li><li>  Iterative interface improvement based on synthetic and business KPI </li></ul><br><br>  I am glad that among the listed applications there are many strong and intriguing ones.  Now the program committee faces a difficult job of reviewing, listening and selecting the best ones in the ProfsoUX program. <br><br>  Other formats are also discussed: blitz reports, round tables, discussions, and also a special perversion: parsing the conference's mobile application.  The latter will take place at the request of the application developers themselves. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d86/7d2/f1f/d867d2f1fd594614ad0ec21fcb65f604.jpg"><br><br>  You can read more about all applications <b><a href="http://profsoux.ru/speakers/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dannouncement">here</a></b> . <br><br>  Register for the conference, grasping the special March price, and you can hear everything live <b><a href="http://profsoux.ru/registration/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dannouncement">here</a></b> . <br><br>  <b>See you at ProfsoUX!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/253921/">https://habr.com/ru/post/253921/</a></p>
