  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Communicators and unofficial firmware</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  So, it all started with the fact that I bought the glofiish x650, instead of the annoying Nokia n91, I didn‚Äôt succeed in borrowing it, it braked notably, a friend from the SC said that the model was not successful and advised x900, listened to a friend and changed x650 on the x900, and again the bummer, he certainly worked quickly, but with a bunch of artifacts, it didn‚Äôt help that I demanded a replacement, I sold the x900 to a friend for 10 tr as I was given HTC 4g MAX to maintain morale due to dismissal, I've been using it for a couple of months now. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I was immensely happy when I was handed the box, but the happiness was not long.  The device complies with all the stated parameters, but it was upsetting me that Maksik worked as a handbrake = (. The situation did not change much after installing the latest official firmware, although it was quick. <br>  Rescued the guys from the famous resource w3bsit3-dns.com.  I found the firmware on the forum, it was listed as unofficial, well, I decided that it would definitely not be any worse.  I read the detailed FAK about flashing, downloaded everything I needed (flasher, hard spl, and the firmware itself) and proceeded to the installation. <br>  Everything went smoothly, and after Hard Reset, I began to use the device to the fullest.  The brakes are gone, there is so much memory in the device, and with the firmware it turned out that even when the TOChlo3d is running, the occupied memory is 40%.  Everything works without problems!  I advised friends of firmware for their devices, also finding them on the Internet. <br>  And this article, I decided to write yesterday, after I asked my friend Glofiish x900 for an unofficial firmware, also found on the resource dedicated to these devices, to my friend.  A friend has already told me 6 times =), it looks like the device is flying! <br>  Although in fact, this Thank you belongs not to me, but to the enthusiasts who create these firmware. <br>  All manufacturers have so-called fan clubs or unofficial sites on which, in addition to a variety of useful programs and device chips, you can find unofficial (custom) firmware.  My experience of flashing my own and other people's phones suggests that such firmware is much more productive than those installed by default.  They are being licensed by the authors much more scrupulously than manufacturers do, which, as I understand it, throws all their strength on the development of new and new devices = ( </div>
