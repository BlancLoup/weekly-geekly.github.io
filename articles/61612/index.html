  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The future is for engineers, not economists</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello.  My name is Kirill, I am 20 years old. <br>  I have been living on habrahabr.ru for a long time, and therefore I decided to write my appeal first of all here, since the majority of the real intellectual elite periodically reads articles just here.  Why am I doing this?  I want to see real sober criticism, find like-minded people and improve the quality of my ideas.  Thank you in advance. <br>  At the moment, in the Russian Federation, huge amounts of money are allocated for the preparation of engineers and technical areas.  The institutes carry out repairs, most often the rector‚Äôs office, assembly hall improve, the checkpoint improves, new buffets are built ... Excellent money acquisition, right? <br>  And yesterday's schoolchildren go to managers, economists, lawyers and the like. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  There is not even worth asking the question, why.  Each of us takes care of our security, solves the housing problem, something needs to be eaten, something to wear, to go somewhere.  And a specialty of a technical nature is not always able to provide adequate well-being.  And people become lawyers economists ... <br>  I know many guys with excellent brains who could have become great scientists ... They don‚Äôt need it, they‚Äôll find it difficult to get somewhere ... and parents-engineers who are not specialty students always loom in front of their eyes ... <br>  Total.  Money in education included.  But the development of this money leaves much to be desired ... <br>  And it's not about education ... The thing is, what will happen after the institute ... <br>  Now, if the guys knew that after the institute, on recommendation, they could get into some kind of institution, where all their needs ‚Äî apartment, car, vacation abroad, and other material benefits ‚Äî would be eliminated, and in exchange for this they would just have to do what was loved by deed, they would really INSIDE AS WOLS at the institute, and would not be charged for exams.  If there existed a real social institution, caring for scientists and providing them with vital functions, there would be more minds. <br>  In the end, it is scientists who facilitate our lives.  They come up with new means of transport, new sources of energy, new technical innovations ... Is it illogical that they do only their favorite business, that is, science, and not be distracted by everyday questions, a la ‚Äúwhere will we go this year?‚Äù, ‚ÄúAnd our neighbors have a new washing machine, but we don‚Äôt have any at all ‚Äùand the like ... <br>  I propose to create a certain corporation, which will take care of the life support of specialists in various fields.  Some separate caste of scientists conducting the necessary research, solving various problems of every possible character.  Something like a government body.  But they only accept laws, and our life does not improve on laws, but on real convenience-machines, the Internet, technology in general ... <br>  The logical question is, on what means will this organization exist?  After all, this is a huge investment of money ... <br>  2 options: <br>  1. Provision by the state.  In principle, it is real, but with time, when efficiency is confirmed. <br>  2. Self-sufficiency.  Implementation of projects that arise within the corporation. <br><br>  And what will we do then?  A single scientific center that allows you to make a technical leap in the development of the country, allowing you to increase the motivation of already students of children, and increase the prestige of technical professions, and finally allows you to create a certain society of the intellectual elite, people who can extend society to a new level of development. <br><br>  So.  At the moment, all this is of course very, very damp.  I demand criticism, for truth is born in controversy.  And I really want to find like-minded people ready for action, for one head is good, but ten is better. <br>  Thanks for attention. </div>
