You will learn everything you need to create your MongoDB-based application.  The course will allow you to master the skills of installing, working with JSON, creating schemes, queries, saving data, indexing and working with language drivers.  During the course, you will build a blog platform based on MongoDB. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Before the start </h4><br>  To successfully complete the course, you need to have knowledge of one of the trend languages <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MongoDB">supported by Mongo</a> .  At the same time, you are not required to have any knowledge of relational databases. <br><br><h4>  Leading </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bb0/e3d/813/bb0e3d813c23a02d7a6f0c5c63d1be67.png" alt="image"><br>  <b>Richard Kreuter</b> is a leading engineer at 10gen, supporting customers by providing them with the skills to install, optimize and scale their applications on MongoDB.  Before that, he worked independently in the ITA team, on their search engine.  Earlier, he was a bioinformatics analyst at Cornell University.  He is a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy and Mathematics at Rutgers University. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/32b/f53/8e6/32bf538e6f380344dc66c880218fea0c.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b>Andrew Erlichson</b> - Provides MongoDB <b>Worldwide</b> Education Program.  Prior to 10gen, he was the CEO and founder of Phanfare, an online photo hosting company now part of Carbonite.  He was also the CEO and founder of Flashbase, a web service for analyzing and organizing databases, which was later acquired by DoubleClick.  In this company, Andrew was vice president of R &amp; D technology.  He worked on the MIPS, Silicon Graphics and BlackRock systems.  He received a Bachelor of Arts in Darsmuss College, and a Masters and PhD in Electrical Engineering at Stanford.

    <h4>  <b>so</b> </h4><br><h4>  Cost? </h4><br>  <b>Is free.</b> <br><br><h4>  What is needed for the course? </h4><br>  You will need a computer with any axis.  Windows, Mac, Linux - everything will fit. <br><br><h4>  What will be the result? </h4><br>  You will receive a certificate of completion of the course on the program 10gen. <br><br><h4>  Do I have to sit in front of the computer during the course hours? </h4><br>  Well, no, no.  The course is provided for self-study, with a restriction during the week.  It is divided into small videos, with periodic tasks, checking your progress.  Once a week, and at the end of the course - an exam. <br><br><h4>  How is the assessment of knowledge? </h4><br>  You will be evaluated on the average hospital among your classmates, but this assessment will not go to the certificate.  To get a certificate, you will need to cover 65% of the material taught.  There are three types of examinations: quizzes, weekly tests, and the final exam.  Quizzes do not affect your assessment, they only allow you to independently assess your knowledge.  But here are the weekly checks - they form half your rating.  The second half depends on the final exam.  Checks have a deadline - often it's Mondays.  Every week we will roll out new lectures, with our exams.  But while we are still not fully determined how it will be in the end. <br><br><h4>  Help wait nowhere? </h4><br>  Well, why.  There will be forums where fellow students can share knowledge.  In addition, instructors and 10gen administrators will follow these forums and try to help.  But, as practice shows, most often, first aid comes precisely from fellow students.  We are also planning to organize weekly online workshops, but have not yet decided on technology. <br><br>  The course will begin on October 22, will last until December 10.  You will need to spend approximately 10 hours of attention per week. <br><br>  And finally, if you still have questions - write to <a href="">education@10gen.com</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://education.10gen.com/courses/10gen/M101/2012_Fall/about">Cool!</a>  <a href="http://education.10gen.com/courses/10gen/M101/2012_Fall/about">I want to get a certificate!</a> <br><br><h4>  Pfff!  I'm already writing on Mongo stopitstsot years! </h4><br>  Ouch!  Perhaps you are interested in the opportunity to consolidate their skills?  How about hardcore?  10gen does not forget about you, and along with the course described above, offers a course for DBA! <br><br>  This course will teach you how to properly manage the production base.  Installation, queries in the shell, export / import, replication and fault tolerance will be considered.  Scaling, indexing, performance tuning, monitoring and sharding.  Well, at the end of the course - backup and recovery.  To start learning, you do not need any knowledge of MongoDB (sick!), But it is desirable that all the above terms do not cause you questions.  Those.  Any knowledge in the administration of databases you still need.  Experience with relational databases, and knowledge of Javascript will be a plus. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a2e/89f/285/a2e89f2856006585f6f3c88148380f13.png" alt="image"><br>  The course will be led by <b>Dwight Merriman</b> , one of the authors of MongoDB.  In 1995, he was one of the founders of DoubleClick, and has been its CTO for 10 years.  He developed the DART advertising system, which serves tens of millions of ads per day.  He is also a co-founder, chairman and architect of Panther Express (now part of CDNetworks) - a CDN network serving hundreds of thousands of objects per second.  Well, also - he is a co-founder and investor of the BusinessInsider.com company in the Gilt Groupe. <br><br>  <a href="http://education.10gen.com/courses/10gen/M102/2012_Fall/about">Hmm ...
