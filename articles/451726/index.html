    <h2>  1. Combine job search with tourism </h2><br><br>  If you have already arrived in the desired country, the likelihood that you will be called for an interview increases dramatically.  You can tell a potential employer that you live abroad, but you will be close to the company's office from such and such a certain number.  This is a strong enough argument to invite you for an interview.  In addition, during this vacation you will learn more about the country to which you are going to move. <br><br><h2>  2. Recommendations are still working. </h2><br><br>  Find your old friends and acquaintances on LinkedIn who work in the country / city you need and ask them to recommend you to your employers.  Obviously, you shouldn‚Äôt say plainly: ‚ÄúI urgently need a job abroad.‚Äù  Spend a little time looking at the open job vacancies of companies, and determine how you could be of help to each of them.  Then ask your friends: ‚ÄúIt seems to me that I am well suited for X and Y jobs from your site.  Could you recommend me? ‚Äù <br><br><h2>  3. Do not write about visa support at every turn. </h2><br><br>  Of course, you need a work visa and all kinds of help with relocate.  But first of all, employers are looking for a person who could benefit them.  Mentioning that you need help with moving is unworthy of the first lines of your resume.  It can be placed somewhere below. <br><br>  You have only 5-10 seconds to interest your recruiter or manager resume.  Most likely, they will read the first couple of lines, after which they will scan the lists and the <b>selected</b> text.  Anyone who will read your resume should immediately understand that you are the ‚Äúsame‚Äù candidate.  To do this, devote a resume not to visa support, but to your experience and skills. <br><br><h2>  4. Your resume should be beyond praise </h2><br><br>  You still have only 5-10 seconds to get a recruiter's attention.  Therefore it is worth making an effort to create a resume that you can be proud of. <br><br><ul><li>  If you are moving to Europe, <a href="https://relocate.me/blog/resume-interview-tips/the-europass-cv-doesnt-work-for-european-tech-companies-anymore/">forget about the Europass format</a> - it is no longer relevant.  Also, do not become attached to resume templates from resources such as HeadHunter and the like.  The network is full of resume templates with which you can make your own from scratch. </li><li>  Brevity is the soul of wit.  Ideally, a resume should take 1-2 pages.  At the same time, try to fully show your main achievements and strengths. </li><li>  Ideally, mention in the resume only those projects, languages, and frameworks that are relevant to a particular job. </li><li>  When describing your work experience, use a formula from Google employees: <i>Reached <b>X</b> by <b>Y</b> , which is confirmed by <b>Z.</b></i> </li><li>  After completing your resume, carefully check it out.  You can use special services such as CV Compiler.com. </li></ul><br><br><h2>  5. Prepare well for the interview. </h2><br><br>  There is a lot of information on the network on <a href="https://relocate.me/blog/resume-interview-tips/how-to-successfully-pass-an-interview-at-a-software-product-company/">how to prepare for a conversation with a recruiter</a> and a technical interview.  You'd be surprised, but most interviews will ask you about the same questions.  Well prepared once, you can always stand out from among the other candidates. <br><br><h2>  6. Cover letter - another chance to be noticed. </h2><br><br>  Write this letter briefly and to the point - it will show that you are a ‚Äútrue techie‚Äù.  You should not send the same cover letter to several companies.  Of course, the template will remain the same, but every recruiter should have the impression that this letter was written personally to him / her.  Try to convince a potential employer that you are suitable for this position like no one else. <br><br>  If your letter can be sent to several companies in a row, it is probably too vague and generalized.  Each company and job is unique - try to adapt the cover letters for them. <br><br><h2>  7. Look for work in the right place. </h2><br><br>  Use specialized sites where companies offer relokate IT professionals, namely: <br><ul><li>  <a href="https://relocate.me/%3Futm%3D5cda673c4c1e08.82744493">Relocate.me</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://techmeabroad.com/">TechMeAbroad</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item%3Fid%3D19543940%26p%3D2">'Who is hiring?'</a>  - section in Hackernews (Visa sponsor: Yes) </li><li>  <a href="https://angel.co/jobs">AngelList</a> (ready to sponsor a visa) </li><li>  <a href="https://landing.jobs/">Landing.jobs</a> </li></ul><br><br>  On these sites, all companies are ready to help you with the move.  You can also make friends with recruitment agencies that specialize in relocations ( <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/%3Ff_C%3D2606373%26locationId%3DOTHERS.worldwide%26start%3D25">Global {M}</a> , <a href="https://relocateme.eu/%3Fref%3Dhabr">Relocateme.eu</a> , <a href="http://www.rave-cruitment.com/">Rave-Cruitment</a> , <a href="https://functionn.io/">Functionn</a> and many others).  If you have already chosen a country for relocate, simply look for local relocation agencies that deal with relocation. <br><br><h2>  8. Bonus Board </h2><br><br>  If you are serious about moving, try changing your LinkedIn location to the country / city you want.  This will attract the attention of recruiters, and help you with the visualization of your goal :) <br><br>  Good luck! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/451726/">https://habr.com/ru/post/451726/</a></p>
