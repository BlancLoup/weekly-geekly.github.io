      Until November 1, the following was written <blockquote>  Your Xamarin license is perpetual.  If you choose, you‚Äôll not be able to renew your subscription. </blockquote>  and after that is completely different ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  A small digression from the topic </h5><br>  Xamarin is an American software development company.  Engaged in the development and support of Mono and application development tools in C # for iOS, Android, Windows, Mac.  Based on Mono, they developed the Xamarin.iOS, Xamarin.Android libraries, which allow developing native applications for mobile platforms in the C # programming language. <br><br>  If someone does not know, then xamarin is bought with a subscription for a year.  There are 4 subscription plans, with a different set of features.  Subscriptions can be renewed every year at <b>full price</b> , thereby receiving new updates and support.  Separately purchased subscriptions for each platform (Android, iOS, MacOS) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2dd/418/fa9/2dd418fa9204605af2a1aae0ea4ea62f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Trouble </h4><br>  Instead of the old licensing order, the FAQ has a new order: <blockquote>  Your apps will continue to run even after your subscription has expired.  You must have your app. </blockquote><br>  Those.  now, after the end of the license, there is no possibility to assemble or deploy applications, update or modify them, in general there are no possibilities. <br><br>  On the same day, one of the co-founders of Xamarin, Joseph Hill, gave the answer <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/368/1b9/2c4/3681b92c464341238c3ca080004d65d1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In short, for existing users, the license is permanent, and new users will be forced to update it every year to develop and maintain applications.  Thus, if you have 4 developers and a license is required for each, say 3 platforms for $ 999, then you <b>spend $ 12,000 a year only on the possibility of development / improvement / updating</b> . <br><br>  This immediately caused an outburst of indignation in the official forum.  Here are some quotes <br><blockquote>  I‚Äôm trying to make it hard for our company but I can't justify this.  Who knows what you will charge after that? <br><br>  I need to get it right xamarin and fast :( </blockquote><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Transfer</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  I actively promoted Xamarin in our company, but I cannot justify price blackmail of this kind in the future.  Who knows how much money you ask for next year?  If I understand everything correctly, then it just sucks and I need to find a way to throw out Xamarin as quickly as possible. </div></div><br><br><blockquote>  I‚Äôve been trying to get it.  Microsoft.  Too expensive.  That blew my mind. </blockquote><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Transfer</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  I even met with local developers from Microsoft and they, of course, knew about Xamarin and tried it.  But even they find it too expensive. </div></div><br><br><blockquote>  They didn‚Äôt email those of us currently evaluating.  There is no mention of any recent license changes on their web site or blog.  At least I couldn't find it. <br><br>  You can‚Äôt be surprised.  They just hoped that they didn‚Äôt care. <br><br>  The company has been focusing on profits. </blockquote><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Transfer</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  They did not send to the mail those who are currently trying the product, that there will be changes in the license.  You may also notice that there is no information on this either on the site or on the blog. <br>  They probably had many internal conversations about how their customers would react to these changes, so our answers are hardly a surprise for them.  They just hoped that we would not notice or we would not care. <br>  Apparently the technical founders are busy developing, and they brought business and financial guys to run the company, focusing on profits. </div></div><br><br>  Here I will say that the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãXamarin that "no one will notice" almost succeeded.  A little later, forum users noticed that the topic where the licensing change was discussed was slowly falling "down" despite the fact that it was under discussion. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aed/5eb/2f3/aed5eb2f3ac62db0baf176da361afc89.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In general, after a couple of weeks of indignation, Xamarin changed his mind <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/590/3ef/ed1/5903efed112a835f138274585edb6008.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Thus, the licensing procedure was returned, the license was again permanent, but the sediment remained ... <br>  Despite the fact that the idea with a subscription for $ 999 per year was rolled back, many Xamarin users on the forum express doubts about the advisability of using this platform in the future.  It is also indicative of the absence of any statements on this topic from the founders of the project, especially from Miguel de Icaz, who as you probably remember, was awarded the prize for promoting free software. <br><br>  Such events sometimes pass by us. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/204032/">https://habr.com/ru/post/204032/</a></p>
