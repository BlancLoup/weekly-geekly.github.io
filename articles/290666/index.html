  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What sites in the next 3 years will search engines and advertisers love</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Year after year in the market for the creation of Internet projects are heated by heated discussions regarding the prospects of a particular area of ‚Äã‚Äãwork.  Thousands of webmasters lead discussions on the themes: ‚ÄúWhich site to create?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhich way to monetize to choose?‚Äù And ‚ÄúWhere is the money, Zin?‚Äù. <br><br>  The main goal is to create a profitable project.  The main risk is the search engine filters (since 90% of commercial projects are fed by search traffic).  Therefore, in order to be successful, on the one hand, it is necessary to become attractive to advertisers, and on the other hand, to protect yourself as much as possible against possible sanctions by the PS (Yandex / Google).  The task is not simple in a dynamic and developing market, but quite real. <br><br>  Having many years of experience in creating and monetizing Internet projects using different schemes (from monetizing google adsense to working with direct advertisers), in this article I would like to express my opinion on the issue of creating and monetizing sites, looking to the perspective of 3 years.

      <br>
      To begin, consider the main options for monetizing sites, their pros and cons.  After that, we define the main criteria for creating a successful Internet project in the future 3-5 years. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Sites for contextual advertising (YAN and Google Adsense) </h4><br>  The most massive trend in the Internet business in the last 5 years.  "Artworks", "content farms", "MFA" - all these abbreviations appeared in the circles of webmasters who create websites for earnings in content networks over the past 5 years. <br><br>  The standard scheme of creation: the collection of search queries - writing articles - placing content on the site - collecting search traffic - making a profit in the networks of contextual advertising. <br><br>  The peak yield of article writers is in 2011-2013.  It was during this period that a huge number of such sites were created, many training courses appeared, etc. <br><br>  Since 2014, work in this direction has become ineffective.  The reasons are simple: high competition among webmasters, the introduction of new PS filters, the cancellation of CSCs by Yandex (partner service centers). <br><br>  By inertia, many continue to work in this direction, creating sites for PCL and adsense.  But in comparison with other options of monetization of sites, for 2015 contextual advertising is rather an additional option of monetization of sites than the main one. <br><br><h4>  CPA sites (affiliate programs) </h4><br>  Many webmasters have preferred to make money on contextual advertising, working with CPA.  But as practice shows, the creation of projects for the monetization of CPA-affiliates is not always justified.  The main problem is the so-called "shaver affiliate".  It is very difficult to track the real number of orders or requests through your website and affiliate programs to take advantage of this. <br><br>  The priority is large partners.  With small things no one counts.  It makes sense to work in this direction if you have proven offers and seed capital for attracting targeted traffic. <br><br><h4>  Sites under the collection of leads (applications / calls) </h4><br>  This direction is actively gaining momentum over the past 1.5-2 years.  The main problem for many webmasters is the need to directly interact with representatives of a live business. <br><br>  ‚ÄúHigh conversion‚Äù and ‚Äúclear Central Asian‚Äù (target audience) come to the fore.  The amount of attracted traffic does not correlate with the profitability of the project.  The most important thing is to attract a ‚Äúpotential buyer‚Äù and generate an application. <br><br>  Accordingly, sites for collecting leads are fundamentally different projects in terms of their structure, type, quality of content, etc. <br><br>  The lead generation market is in the making.  Landings are tested, various A / B tests are conducted, etc. <br>  Some of the most successful webmasters lead-generators prefer to go to direct sales, using proven technologies to attract live customers. <br><br>  Those who are more lazy and do not want to get involved in offline work for a percentage of the order, rent sites. <br><br><h4>  Sites under direct advertisers </h4><br>  The direction is interesting for many.  But the main problem today is the low level of education of webmasters in working with direct advertisers, the lack of real practice. <br><br>  For the most part, work with direct advertisers is associated exclusively with the sale of banners.  People do not see beyond the outstretched hand. <br><br>  In fact, there are many methods and schemes of interaction with direct advertisers and live business.  Here are some of them: <br><ul><li>  Sale of graphic banners; </li><li>  Special catalogs; </li><li>  Separate landing pages for the advertiser in the framework of the thematic site; </li><li>  Mini-sites within the information portal; </li><li>  Business information support; </li><li>  And etc. </li></ul><br><br>  The amount of traffic in working with direct advertisers is not the main criterion for success!  Its quality, credibility of the resource, an interesting and advantageous offer for the advertiser is important. <br><br><h4>  Sites for direct sales </h4><br>  The most profitable of all areas of work, but involves communication with offline.  Suitable for people who are willing to work offline or have a reliable partner.  A great advantage will be the experience of monetizing their projects through the sale of leads and direct advertisers. <br><br>  <i>We considered the main ways to monetize Internet projects, and now it is time to determine the main criteria for creating a successful website in the perspective of 3 years.</i> <br><br><ol><li>  Sites sharpened under a clear target audience (target audience).  Generally thematic projects created for collecting ‚Äúdisparate‚Äù traffic becomes unprofitable and unsafe to create. </li><li>  Quality content that meets the needs of Central Asia and is able to convert a site visitor into a buyer.  Quality is determined not by the volume of content and not the notorious ‚Äúuniqueness for PS‚Äù, but by the ability to solve the visitor‚Äôs problem quickly and efficiently. </li><li>  The correct structure of the site, consisting of thematic clusters, interrelated and complementary.  Those.  a chain must be created through which the user passes.  It is also necessary to satisfy the add-on interests of the user within the framework of the subject. </li><li>  Part of the traffic should not be from search.  This directly affects security and filters.  Strive to get type-in ‚Äã‚Äãtraffic, promote brand queries, interact with social networks, etc. </li><li>  You must strive to create a niche leader, an expert site in your field. </li></ol><br><br><h4>  Some trends for the near future in site building: </h4><br><br><ol><li>  Adaptive design; </li><li>  Website optimization for mobile traffic; </li><li>  Brand promotion; </li><li>  Creating a permanent core audience; </li><li>  Work in narrow niches. </li></ol></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290666/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290666/</a></p>
