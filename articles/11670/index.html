  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Web 2.0 -> Life 2.0</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Now everyone has heard of such a term as ‚ÄúWeb 2.0‚Äù. Someone puts in it a specific meaning, who proves its amorphousness and calls it a new trick of marketers. <br>  As for me, these disputes do not carry a grain of common sense.  After all, it is clear that this term is not, and cannot be universal, even in the context of the Web. <br>  In fact, what we mean by web 2.0 is just one of the components of globalization, or, if you will, a part of those changes in the world that will fundamentally change the philosophy of information dissemination and even the general way of life of people. <br><br>  Web 2.0 is the simplification, optimization, transformation and socialization of the Internet.  But not only the Internet, similar processes go and must go in many areas.  Take, for example, work - why does an employee in Google and a number of other companies working primarily in the field of new technologies not necessarily come to work at exactly 9 and leave at 6 exactly, sitting their pants in their dusty, dull office?  Yes, because it is not an effective use of intellectual human resources and working time! <br><br>  It‚Äôs better if a person sits an hour with a laptop by the pool - but in that hour he will give an idea that will make millions, and most importantly will change the world in a positive way.  It is not necessary to sit all day in the office and, figuratively speaking, ‚Äúsuffer garbage‚Äù (This is definitely a simplified model, only to show the imperfection of the present one) in order to be useful - let everyone better think what he should do to achieve concrete results.  The management should do everything so that the employee feels comfortable, so that he earns money, but at the same time he was pleased to work in his company, so that he knows that we are changing the world for the better, creating something new, and not doing endless stamping tons of waste paper!

      Someone will say, this is utopia, everyone thinks only about how to grab a bigger piece of themselves, that no one is interested in the development of something new, something that can be a blessing for all.  But examples of Wikipedia, as well as many other social networks, show that this is not the case.  But why go far, take the example of the European Union - if this is not a voluntary association of all, to create something new, better, not an alliance for the collective good, then what is it? <br><br>  What I wrote lines above, and the fact that the changes affect, or at least will affect all or almost all areas of human life. <br>  Why if we are talking about new principles on the Web - about social orientation, free of charge, convenience, simplicity, and so on.  - then this principles apply only to the Internet? <br><br>  But in real life we ‚Äã‚Äãwill leave everything in the old way ?! <br>  Changes should affect all or almost all areas of human life. <br><br>  Let's take for example such a field as advertising and marketing: <br>  The total mass of advertising today is brazen and stupid, it is designed for narrow-minded people who, having seen a bright picture or a catchy slogan, will immediately run to buy this or that service or product. <br>  Marketers and PR people come up with ridiculous stories and slogans for their products, and the main thing for them is WISHING TO PROMISE EVERYTHING, they seem to mean people are bad, and suckers have to be bred for money. <br><br>  Advertising, today, is driven by the desire to SELL AS POSSIBLE MORE, NOT TALKING ABOUT THE REAL VALUE AND NECESSITY OF THE GOODS OR SERVICES FOR THAT OR FOR OTHER MAN. <br>  Simply put, advertisers very often simply deceive a client in various forms. <br>  Their philosophy is we will sell, but whether a person really needs this or that service is not important.  For a long time, this approach was quite normal and justified throughout the world. <br><br>  But the world is changing, just as the network is changing.  Yes, you can act as before, but you can move to a new level of development, to adopt a new philosophy for yourself.  It is difficult, and this transition will take a lot of time across the country, especially in the realities of countries such as Russia or Ukraine. <br>  But this does not prevent the use of new philosophy to specific people in specific projects.  This philosophy is understandable to people and, as practice shows, makes it possible to achieve success! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/11670/">https://habr.com/ru/post/11670/</a></p>
