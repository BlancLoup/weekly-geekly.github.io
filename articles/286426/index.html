  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Admission to the PhD - 2-3. Language tests and GRE</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/10546/">With the previous post,</a> I started a small series on the process of entering the postgraduate program at foreign universities (mainly the USA, but the information may be relevant for other countries). <br><br>  This time I wanted to talk about one of the most important problems that arises in the way of the entrant - language and not quite exams. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  2. Language exams </h4><br>  About learning the language on Habr√© was written a lot, including met and articles about passing exams.  The topic is popular, as TOEFL or IELTS is a nightmare for many applicants in all countries.  I will not teach how to take the exam, at the end I will simply present a small list of useful resources.  Instead, I‚Äôll talk briefly about my surrender experience. <br><br><h4>  IELTS or TOEFL? </h4><br>  It is also a popular question that many articles on different resources are devoted to, where, among other things, the difference between these exams is explained in detail.  Personally, I think that TOEFL is more difficult (the topic of a separate holivar), but this is a matter of personal preferences.  In terms of practicality, it all depends on where you are going to serve.  IELTS is widely used as a language skills assessment tool in Europe (especially in the UK, where TOEFL is no longer accepted by the migration service, and followed by many universities) and Australia.  In the USA and Canada, the results of both TOEFL and IELTS are most often accepted.  Sometimes results of certification tests like FCE, CPE, etc. are also accepted.  Although sometimes you can see exceptional requirements like the one mentioned by Britain, as well as some US universities that accept TOEFL exclusively. <br>  The difference between TOEFL and IELTS also becomes noticeable when it comes to the minimum passing score.  In the IELTS score is set in the range from 0 to 9 in increments of 0.5 points, and in TOEFL from 0 to 120 in increments of 1 point.  Accordingly, in the latter case, the resulting estimate of 86 with the required 87 looks so low, in contrast to the IELTS, where the difference between 6.5 and the required 7 looks almost a chasm.  Since by the time I passed the tests I didn‚Äôt know where I was going to serve, and also for more freedom of choice, I passed both exams (IELTS 7.5, TOEFL 110).

    <h4>  Training </h4><br>  Even if you spent years in an English-speaking society and are fluent in the language, you still have to spend some time getting to know the test and practice a little (although if you have a bachelor's degree in an English-speaking country, you do not need to take language tests).  And all the rest of the training is necessary if there is an intention to score a high score.  Training options are very diverse - numerous language courses (in which I do not see the point), tutoring, online courses, as well as self-study without any investments (yes, I believe that this is possible, although I could not prove it to my experience because of laziness).  The expected preparation time depends entirely and completely on the current level of ownership (but if the level is lower than the intermediate level, I would generally wait with the receipt). <br><br>  My more or less focused preparation took about three to four years.  The first three years she was passive - I stopped watching movies in Russian, listened to a number of books in English (for example, the entire series of books about Harry Potter), tried to read as much as possible in English non-technical literature.  As a result, the sections of listening and reading in tests were not at all difficult.  It is more difficult with speech skills (written and oral speech) - for practice you need a native speaker or a professional speaker.  Then I had to spend money on an online tutor for a couple of months with which I could talk and practice the oral part of the exam.  At the same time, there are many resources where you can talk to foreigners for free.  Actually, a lot of materials are devoted to passing tests, techniques and useful techniques, ranging from official textbooks to paid or free teaching materials from third-party teachers. <br><br><h4>  Passing the test and sending the results </h4><br>  If you live in Moscow, St. Petersburg or another large city, then there should be no difficulties with registration and delivery, but it is best to register at least one month since there may not be enough free places on the desired date.  From other cities you will have to go to the nearest test center, and in the case of IELTS even several times. <br>  The price of the issue is not the lowest - and IELTS and TOEFL will cost about $ 250.  In the case of an insufficiently high result, of course, you can retake, but repeated re-passes will result in a loss of money and time. <br><br>  IELTS results become known 14 days after the test, TOEFL results about 10 days later.  In either case, you will receive certificates of results, but for US universities they do not have any power - the results of all examinations should go to university admissions offices directly from test centers.  If you need to send an IELTS certificate, it will be worth the extra money (with the exception of e-mail, but this is not possible at all universities), as well as in the case of TOEFL - sending each result will cost $ 19.  Both in this and in the other test, you can send 4 certificates for free if you specify the required universities before the end of the test (that is, if you already know where you want to send the results).  Letters with results from test centers are sent within 7-10 days plus the time for delivery of the letter by the postal service of the country - this period should be taken into account when planning the exam date.  Some universities (for example, Carnegie Mellon) set a hard deadline for documents - if the test results did not arrive before the deadline for admission, they will not be considered.  Therefore, it is usually recommended to take tests at least one month before the deadline, and preferably even earlier. <br><br><h4>  3. GRE Exam </h4><br>  Graduate Record Examination is another headache for those who want to be among the students in American universities.  The exam is of two types - General GRE and Subject GRE.  The first is required in virtually all areas of study and is most often included in university-wide requirements.  The second is a specialty exam and is required only in individual faculties.  Recently, ETS has ceased to conduct the Computer Science Subject test, however, it has rarely been required to pass this exam before.  If you want to apply for a program related to mathematics (pure math, applied math or financial math), be prepared to take the Mathematics Subject test, which is submitted three times a year. <br><br>  General GRE is held several times a month, procedural issues (registration, handing over, receiving and sending the results) are about the same as in the case of TOEFL.  The main goal of this test, at least, as it is declared by its authors and members of admissions committees, is to be able to objectively compare the intellectual capabilities of candidates from different countries with different educational systems. <br><br>  The test consists of three parts.  First, two essays are written, with 30 minutes each.  Then the second part begins immediately: vocabulary test (20 questions, 30 minutes), math test (20 questions, 35 minutes).  Then there is an optional break of 10 minutes and the third: vocabulary test (20 questions, 30 minutes), math test (20 questions, 35 minutes).  The test is adaptive, that is, if a poor result is shown in the first block of a vocabulary or mathematical test, the second block will be easier, if the first one is solved well, the second block will be more difficult.  Each task has its own weight, depending on the complexity, which affects the final result. <br><br>  It should be understood that, despite the fact that grammar is important, GRE is not intended to test proficiency.  Therefore, the works in it are much more complicated than in TOEFL or IELTS.  There are two pieces of work - in the first (Analyze an Issue) you need to analyze a problem, propose a solution, express your opinion and substantiate it, in the second (Analyze an Argument) someone else‚Äôs reasoning is given and you need to analyze them, find errors, indicate them , determine what information is missing for a reasoned conclusion, what alternative explanations may exist.  In both essays a high score will bring only texts with deep detailed analysis, written correctly and consistently.  All possible topics are published on the site, but there are a lot of them - about 150 for each section. <br>  The vocabulary part (Verbal) is a collection of various test tasks with answer choices.  For successful passage, you need to have a fairly extensive vocabulary of rare and common words (especially all sorts of synonyms), as well as logical thinking (since there are often questions like ‚Äúbeing true, which of the arguments will strengthen or weaken the reasoning in the text‚Äù).  For those with non-native English, this part is considered the most difficult. <br><br>  The mathematical part (Quantitative) should not cause difficulties for those who knew mathematics well at school, and even more so for those entering computer science or mathematics, almost all of the tasks do not go beyond the school course.  The main source of problems I had was a simple inattention, so on the real exam I rechecked the tasks two times, the benefit of 35 minutes for 20 tasks is more than is actually needed. <br><br>  As with any other exam, General GRE needs to be thoroughly prepared, however, the preparation in this case will be different.  Take a test to identify your weak points and learn ‚Äúwords, words, words.‚Äù  In addition, it is important to practice writing essays. <br><br>  The GRE test is estimated as follows: you can get from 0 to 6 points in 0.5 increments for an essay;  vocabulary and mathematical part are estimated from 130 to 170 points (in the new edition of the test).  However, greater interest and information is of the percentile - how many who passed the test scored the result is not better than yours.  Despite the fact that almost all universities write that the minimum passing score for the GRE is not set, most of them, however, publish the average results of accepted candidates, usually around 70-80% or more.  And with the interpretation of the results arises the biggest problem of the applicant.  Since there are no clear criteria for how the test results affect the candidate‚Äôs chances, it is difficult to assess whether or not it is worth risking applying to certain universities.  Some sources claim that in admissions committees are well aware of the problems that arise from foreigners with the vocabulary part of the test.  For example, in Berkeley it is written that they look mainly at the mathematical part, and the dictionary simply should not be too low, otherwise it becomes doubtful.  On the forums, members of admissions committees write that test results do not affect very much, because the test is not an adequate indicator of the potential success of a graduate student, as long as they are not too low.  Others write that good GRE results, combined with a high average diploma grade, almost guarantee that medium-level universities that have not much competition will enter.  In the list of references, I provide a link to a site where you can roughly assess your chances of admission depending on the results of the exams. <br><br>  A further list of sources, of course, is extremely incomplete, information about the tests, about preparing for them, about various delivery methods, tutors and courses on the Internet is a great deal.  I just provide links to resources that have been very useful for me and I want to share them with those who still do not know about them. <br><br><ol><li>  A site where you can find partners for training in colloquial speech <a href="http://www.speaking24.com/">www.speaking24.com</a> </li><li>  A site that assesses the chances of applying to PhD Computer Science programs at various universities <a href="http://www.cs.utep.edu/nigel/estimator/">www.cs.utep.edu/nigel/estimator</a> </li></ol><br>  TOEFL <br><ol><li>  Official Exam <a href="http://www.ets.org/toefl/ibt/about">Website www.ets.org/toefl/ibt/about</a> </li><li>  NoteFull - online TOEFL tutors, in addition to paid material, contains a large amount of extremely useful free material, and also offers the opportunity for a small amount to evaluate written or conversational skills <a href="https://www.notefull.com/content.php%3FpgID%3D575">www.notefull.com/content.php?pgID=575</a> </li><li>  Youtube channel of NoteFull - a large number of useful videos <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/NoteFulldotcom">www.youtube.com/user/NoteFulldotcom</a> </li></ol><br>  IELTS <br><ol><li>  The official site of the exam <a href="http://www.ielts.org/test_takers_information.aspx">www.ielts.org/test_takers_information.aspx</a> </li><li>  Emma's English teacher's Youtube channel (the video about part of speaking was especially helpful to me) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/EnglishTeacherEmma">www.youtube.com/user/EnglishTeacherEmma</a> </li></ol><br>  GRE General <br><ol><li>  Official exam website <a href="http://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/about">www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/about</a> </li><li>  The official application for the preparation - reproduces the real situation of the exam <a href="http://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/prepare/powerprep2">www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/prepare/powerprep2</a> </li><li>  General GRE preparation blog - contains a lot of free educational material, preparation plans for GRE (monthly, three-month, semi-annual), an excellent dictionary, a mobile preparation application (flash cards) <a href="http://magoosh.com/gre/">magoosh.com/gre</a> </li><li>  Youtube-playlist about the written part of General GRE <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist%3Flist%3DPLTGjCRqeH7hPlLtgMdkS8I-iBFqqYCiBN">www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTGjCRqeH7hPlLtgMdkS8I-iBFqqYCiBN</a> </li></ol></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/286426/">https://habr.com/ru/post/286426/</a></p>
