Our answer is nothing to shed light on the question.  For example, what is DNX?  The project repository tells us: <br><br>  <b>DNX</b> (.Net runtime) - contains the code needed to load the application and its operation, including the build system, SDK, and CLR of the host. <br><br>  Personally, until recently, I didn‚Äôt say anything, just like you.  But this is the <b>future of ASP.NET</b> .

      Or, for example, many do not understand why everyone is going crazy about the possibility of running ASP.NET 5 on Linux under the newest CoreCLR core ... But not today - tomorrow, ASP.NET developer jobs for Linux will start appearing and we all suddenly realize: we are old people, and young people have already studied and know, capturing all expensive vacancies. <br><br>  <b>And generally ... How many rantaymy now?</b>  <b>Where did the world go with the one and only CLR, and why did he suddenly stop arranging everyone ??</b> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The tasks of the speakers of the CLRium are to dig up so much fresh that you leave it in disarray: what should you do tomorrow?  And, gaining spirit, they began to study all this just as we did: devoting all free time to a new hobby <br><br><h3>  Andrey <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/dreamwalker/" class="user_link">DreamWalker</a> Akinshin </h3><br><br><h3>  CoreCLR </h3><br><ul><li>  Let's talk about the new .NET core CoreRR and the future of the .NET platform. </li><li>  Let's collect CoreCLR under Windows and Linux, and also talk about the new cross-platform .NET-world. </li><li>  Consider the insides CLR, available to us on the source code.  (Joint Report) </li><li>  We build in the core the functionality and we will not break application. </li></ul><br><h3>  Ryujit </h3><br><ul><li>  Let's talk about the features of the new RyuJIT and what its use will give us (for example, SIMD and accelerated JIT compilation). </li><li>  We will compare the old and the new JIT in detail, discuss their differences and the used optimizations. </li><li>  Let's look at JIT-bugs for various processor architectures. </li><li>  We will look at the generated ASM code a lot. </li><li>  Let's try to run a project on RyuJIT and measure application performance with and without it on a set of synthetic tests. </li></ul><br><h3>  ASP.NET, DNX </h3><br><ul><li>  Take a look at the latest ASP.NET 5 and DNX execution system. </li><li>  Let's run an ASP.NET site under Linux. </li></ul><br><br><h3>  Stanislav Sidristij Sidristy </h3><br><br><h4>  The magic of working with types </h4><br><p>  A warm-up report that, like the CLRium # 1, is full of controversial ideas, but very interesting from that. </p><br><ul><li>  How in 10 ms to change the methods returned from the closed API, the object, closing the bug that existed there </li><li>  How to map List &amp; ltB &amp; gt to List &amp; ltA &amp; gt, where B is inherited from A and why it might be useful </li><li>  Features of casting in different scenarios and testing their performance.  Is it so bad to constantly cast types?  Why is it better to abandon interfaces in load-intensive applications? </li><li>  How to adjust the fastest interaction between applications - SharedMemory - without serialization of reference types?  As a result, the resulting code will be limited to one limitation - the switching time between application threads. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Corefx </h4><br><p>  Many people say that openness of the .NET Framework for the community and providing the community with opportunities for free editing is bad and is fraught with endless bugs, careless code and unstable API.  Is it so? </p><br><ul><li>  Results of half a year of open .NET Framework CoreFx. </li><li>  Increased performance from 10x to 1000x multiple in some places. </li><li>  Closed bugs. </li><li>  The ratio of community code to .NET Framework command code. </li><li>  Let's try to compile and parse the application written for CoreFx. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Security </h4><br><ul><li>  We forward the object and everything that it points to in the sandbox, bypassing all security barriers in .NET so that the sandbox could not take advantage of the opportunity and break the defense </li><li>  Consider options to leave the sandbox on a pair of CLR cores already closed. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Roslyn - extensions for compilers and MS Visual Studio - for design needs </h4><br><p> In my practice, very often there are requirements to do some kind of routine, and constantly remember about something.  As the first example that comes up in the head, it is necessary to insert checks for correctness of arguments at the beginning of each public method of a public class.  This is correct, but sometimes you forget, and CodeReview delays.  It would be convenient to have an analyzer for this case.  Or, for example, instead of the code <code>if(x != null) x.DoSomething()</code> , so that you can write <code>x.Eval(x =&gt; x.DoSomething())</code> - our analog <code>?.</code>  from C # 6. Code analyzers are suitable for all tasks of this kind, which are not as difficult to write as it seems. </p><br><br><p>  For example, for SpecFlow-based testing automators, it would be convenient to have an analyzer that would search for all feature files, and check if they contain the steps that are announced in the code.  And if there were no such steps, I would have cursed and asked to remove the extra method. </p><br><br><ul><li>  We will learn how to make extensions for MS Visual Studio 2015, embedding various code refactorings and analyzers for work tasks: real examples from our own experience </li><li>  We will analyze from simple to complex how the existing rules are arranged in the supply of Roslyn (C # 6 features).  But we will not consider the list, as they do at conferences, but their source code. </li><li>  As soon as we review them, we will review the existing metrics on Roslyn.  How they are written, how code metrics are built. </li><li>  Next, we will write not just count the number of letters "a" in all the words of the source texts, we will write support for C # <b>tuples</b> , thereby showing how easy Microsoft will expand the language in the future: we have a happy future !! </li></ul><br><br>  I hope the program turned out as tasty as possible. <br><br><h1>  <b>check in</b> </h1><br>  Available for any city - online and offline - for <b>Moscow</b> (April 03-04), <b>Yekaterinburg</b> (May 17) and <b>St. Petersburg</b> (May 29-30).
