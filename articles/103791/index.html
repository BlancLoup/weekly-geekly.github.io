      Those who tried to conduct one-cent campaigns know that Yandex does not like to provide its advertising space of any kind to ‚Äúfreeloaders‚Äù.  It‚Äôs not good to set up the RK and get a low CTR, as a domoklov sword hits your campaign, raising the minimum search price (MSC) for the domain as a whole.  Single-centric RK is walking on the blade of a knife, any wrong action and the MCC soars upward, depriving your one-cent announcement of a broadcast on the search and as a result of tasty and cheap traffic, leaving us miserable scraps from YAN.  It must be said that webmasters no less ‚Äúlove‚Äù odnocentovikov and many of them blocking such ads on their sites with frenzy.  Thus, over time, you risk staying at all without tasty traffic. <br><br>  Single-cent traffic is ideal for any start-up-services-forums, entertainment and news sites with a coherent model of existing or planned monetization.  In general, one-cent traffic from Yandex.Direct can theoretically be obtained in any subject.  But you need to be realistic - trying to get low-cost traffic, say, in the topic of legal services will be unprofitable (except for the slippery Temka ‚Äúfree legal advice‚Äù) - you will have to spend a week setting up the ROK, and you will receive traffic per hour by a teaspoon, and conversion will be ten times worse than in the classic RK.  If you want to get customers in such subjects - you need to go along the beaten track - butting with competitors for the best places. <br><br>  They drove.  A priori, we believe that initially we can pay up to 0.05 USD per click, followed by a decrease. <br><br><h4>  Baseline conditions </h4><br><br>  We have a certain site - a platform for the announcement of agricultural thematics with an easy and simple monetization model - paid placement of our ads and reading contact information - in others.  Payment via SMS.  Net profit from one SMS - 30 rubles.  You do not need to be a mathematician to understand: to get a positive ROI, we need one-cent traffic with a conversion of at least 1%.  Wonderful.  This is our minimum task. <br><br>  Question: how to correctly configure and conduct a "one-cent" RK in Yandex Direct? <br><br><h4>  Step 1. We select words </h4><br><br>  Rule number 1 in the selection of words - <b>do not chase the RF queries!</b>  By definition, any RF request carries a lot of thematic noise compared to the MF.  As a result, it is much easier to keep an acceptable CTR on 10 derived phrases with a frequency of 1000 per month than to keep the same CTR on the 1st source phrase with a frequency of 10,000 per month.  To show ads in the wrong place and in the wrong people is an unaffordable luxury for ours, let's be frank, a beggarly budget. <br><br>  For beginners it is optimal to focus on the figure of 100-2000 hits per month.  It is possible and less, but only if you have an infinite amount of free time to tune and manage all this low-frequency home gardens. <br><br>  We go to wordstat.yandex.ru and poke around in queries.  We are looking for banal and most incredible key phrases that will be interesting to our audience.  Among them sometimes come across unthinkable words and sentences: buy in full. <br><br>  Pick up the request of the top level "grain" and plow the field ... <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/687eea4c/0dd08763/72acbc77/04e05d17.png"><br><br>  When there is a confidence that there is nothing left, we take the following word from our agricultural subject matter. <br><br>  <i>Hint</i> .  If the semantic core in all directions is similar - you can not torture WordStat.  To activate the time saving cheat, press Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V, Ctrl-H, in ‚ÄúFind‚Äù we write Grains in ‚ÄúReplace‚Äù we write Flour.  Then, we will do the same for requests ‚Äúwheat‚Äù, ‚Äúbuckwheat‚Äù, ‚Äúsunflower‚Äù, etc.  according to the reference book of agricultural cultures. <br><br>  Next, we add typos, spelling errors, slang and everything that is enough for our violent fantasy.  Pshynitsa, sunshine, bran etc.  And do not think that in your subject the entire audience speaks and writes in perfect Russian - WordStat will easily dissuade you from this. <br><br><h4>  Step 2. Sift words. </h4><br><br>  We take our footcloth out of requests, add them up and drive them into ‚Äúan estimate of the budget of an advertising campaign‚Äù (Yandex predictor).  In parallel, we brush requests.  Requests with the predicted number of hits 0 (zero) are turned off, because there is no point in wasting time on them.  Inquiries with predictive impressions of more than 2000 are split up.  Inquiries with a forecast of 0.05-0.2 entry into the guarantee are quotable (oh, flew out) - so it will be easier to type CTR in dynamic displays.  It is better to refuse requests with a forecast of entry into the guarantee above 0.2 - these are commercial inquiries and the auction for them will most likely be overheated without us.  As already mentioned, one-cent traffic can be received from there, but this gimor is not worth the trouble. <br><br><h4>  Step 3. We write announcements. </h4><br><br>  We drive the combed out bitch out of the requests into the sample xls file for the fill.  We gain patience and with the help of copy-paste, automatic replacement, macros, common sense and plane, we plan our ad for each request. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/a67e6b1b/34bb03ff/ca210045/e92d654c.png"><br><br>  <b>Rule number 1</b> One request - one ad. <br><br>  <b>Rule number 2</b> If there is no money at high rates, you must include a request in the ad title.  Thus, the chances of success are significantly increased - the bold request in the ad text looks much more attractive.  And do not ask why.  This is how the world works. <br><br>  <b>Rule number 3</b> Do not write silly texts, give up the idiotic creativity.  Creativity can give you a CTR, but is unlikely to provide a conversion.  Write a simple, understandable, accessible language FM.  Dostoevsky.  Re-read "Idiot" eh. <br><br>  <b>Rule number 4</b> Ask people logical answers to their requests.  Further in the text of the announcement hint where it is possible to find the authentic answer. <br><br>  <b>Rule number 5</b> Do not be lazy, minus excess garbage until blue in the campaign level. <br><br>  Fill in the account on Direct.  If the points are not enough - fill in parts.  Include or not include YAN - decide for yourself, you must know the geographical and temporal targeting for your site better than the author of the article.  When you turn on the YAN, it will be very correct to think about the PT (taking into account user interests).  With a flick of the wrist, we send a campaign for moderation and successfully complete it. <br><br><h4>  Step 4. Setting and bidding </h4><br><br>  The ad campaign is ready, moderated and launched on the voyage.  To begin with, we try to work according to the method of ‚Äúentering the guarantee + 1%‚Äù, but not more than 0.03 u.  If a good request has a warranty entry of $ 0.05, we are not greedy.  As the CTR increases and the threshold for entering the guarantee decreases, we gradually reduce the rates.  If the CTR is already good, and the entrance to the guarantee is not reduced - we are moving to a dynamic.  With a good CTR there is also a good life there - we will jump out quite often in rotation.  Yandex Direct will very quickly prompt us the correctness of our actions with the help of a minimum click price on a search.  If it rose - most likely we somewhere made a critical error (s).  If it is concreted at 0.01, we are happy, because  on our street will soon be a holiday. <br><br><h4>  Step 5. Enjoy! </h4><br><br>  RK started on September 1.  Already, the RK, despite its evaluative nature, has achieved excellent performance.  It is easy to calculate that the average ROI was 2.73, yesterday was 3.12, and this morning every ruble invested in Kazakhstan gave us a sevenfold profit.  The amount of traffic is required to grow.  Now about 80% of the phrases in the dynamics - the rest in the guarantee.  Over time, it is expected to output a guarantee of all phrases.  The forecast for the amount of traffic 1000-1500 per day (envy in white). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/3e6403df/8792bbae/d130d7b5/5511ab97.png"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/103791/">https://habr.com/ru/post/103791/</a></p>
