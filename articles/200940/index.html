  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How we officially became the media</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I greet the venerable Habrazhiteley!  Last week, I personally received from the hands of an employee of Roskomnadzor the following paper with a seal and watermarks: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0e5/430/d08/0e5430d080c2c589e3742cbd5b5dfe05.jpg"><br><br>  The procedure for registering network media has been repeatedly covered, including at <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/76690/">Habr√©</a> .  Under the cut, I will talk about several pitfalls that we encountered on the way to this. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Immediately, it should be noted that the registration procedure is not so terrible and, subject to all the nuances, it is possible to get permission for a relatively small amount and a short time (officially 30 days, in reality, a month and a half).  The whole question of the need for such registration.  The pros and cons, to be honest, are ‚Äúfar-fetched.‚Äù  The main advantage of registration is the ability to throw dust in the eyes of an incredulous person.  And after receiving the registration, you can argue with great importance that closing your site is a criminal offense.  Potential copyright protection does not interest us, since all articles in the journal are published under the sign of copyleft (they are available free of charge to everyone, provided that the author is indicated)  The main disadvantage is the time and money spent.  We are engaged in the publication of an <a href="http://labfranep.com/article/7/">electronic scientific journal</a> , so for our authors it is extremely important to have publications, if not in the WAK, then at least in an officially registered edition, therefore we made the decision on official registration initially. <br><br>  The first thing you need is to collect and fill in all the necessary documents: <br>  - A notarized copy of the passport; <br>  - A notarized copy of the document confirming the rights of the domain administrator; <br>  - Application; <br>  - Receipt of payment of state tax with a bank mark of payment; <br>  - Optional, but it is advisable to enclose a letter of arbitrary shape in the envelope with a description of the documents sent.

      The magazine was registered in the name of the chief editor as an individual.  This is much more convenient, since there is no need to re-register when moving to a new office.  For registration of the journal to a legal entity, additional documents will be required (copy of the Charter, extracts from the Unified Register of Legal Entities, document on the actual address). <br><br>  A notarized copy of the document confirming the rights of the domain administrator was received relatively quickly (we are ‚Äúhosting‚Äù at the RU-Center, a letter with the original came from them two weeks after the request).  If you have any questions, contact the technical support of the hosting.  With notarization of problems should arise.  We have all accepted and assured without comment. <br><br>  The main difficulties arose in completing the Roskomnadzor questionnaire.  Starting from the seventh point, it is necessary to indicate the expected frequency of release, the maximum volume and the expected territory of distribution.  With respect to the site, these criteria are not suitable, but the fields must be filled.  We specified as periodicity the data on the pdf-version of our magazine (4 times a year), we chose Russia and foreign countries as the distribution area.  This increases the size of the state duty, but otherwise you can simply not register.  The most interesting was the volume.  I have little idea how much we will operate even in the next five years.  Maybe we will continue to publish a pdf file compressed to 10 megabytes, or maybe we decide to put a 20 terabyte base of photo images of the ground cover?  And what if we put it not on our server?  As a result, we have exhausted the attempts of a logical solution of this problem, and I, taking responsibility, with a totalitarian solution indicated 1024 ^ 999 bytes in the questionnaire, which even in terms of yottabayty represents a huge number.  I can not vouch, but I suspect that by the maximum volume we have become absolute champions. <br><br>  Separately, it is necessary to mention the state duty.  Its size depends on the type of publication (for an erotic amount is higher), the volume of advertising (if the threshold is exceeded 40%, the amount increases) and the region of distribution (registration of regional media is cheaper).  All this you can find on the <a href="http://rkn.gov.ru/mass-communications/smi-registation/">website of Roskomnadzor</a> .  The only thing they don‚Äôt talk about openly is that the amount of state duty for registration of educational and cultural-educational media is reduced 5 times.  This can be deducted only in the attached documents.  In order to avoid unnecessary questions, we indicated this with the first phrase in the receipt of state duty payment and paragraph 6 of the questionnaire (‚ÄúApproximate subject matter‚Äù): ‚ÄúEducational and cultural-educational media ...‚Äù. <br><br>  In addition to the application for registration of electronic media, we filed a similar registration of the printed with the same name.  Letters were sent out on the same day of July, and in the middle of September there was a refusal to register a printed publication, due to the fact that a publication with the same distribution form and the same name (‚ÄúLaboratory Journal‚Äù) was already registered.  For the future lesson, if you want to register the media, <a href="http://rkn.gov.ru/mass-communications/reestr/media/">make sure</a> that no one has used your chosen name and form of distribution before you. <br><br>  The message was upset, but did not kill hope in the success of registration of the electronic version of the magazine.  But the second letter never came.  The first two weeks I sinned at the Post of Russia, however, I later found confirmation of successful registration on the Roskomnadzor website.  Why didn't they send the second letter? <br><br>  I was lucky with an opportunity, in the middle of October in Pushchino (Moscow region) a conference was held, of which I was honored to be a participant.  Taking advantage of this, I traveled to Moscow, where at Kitaygorodsky Prospect, 7, bldg. 2, I took the finished certificate (it was necessary to give its number).  The girl who issued it to me very sadly asked: "Why do you never call on the phone before coming?".  When I asked why so long they did not send ready-made documents, I never received a clear answer.  Maybe they just forgot about them.  Despite this, the work of Roskomnadzor in terms of politeness and issuing documents left a rather positive impression, especially due to the electronic queue and easy access to the building. <br><habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/200940/">https://habr.com/ru/post/200940/</a></p>
