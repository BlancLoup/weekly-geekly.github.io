      I carry this device to the store, and in a couple of days I was approved to replace the device. <br>  In the store, they tell me that since such keyboards are no longer sold, they will not be able to make an exchange on the cost of the keyboard at the moment.  And they can either make a replacement on the price tag in the check, or return the money. <br><br>  By the way, I bought it for ¬£ 599, now the <a href="http://market.yandex.ru/product/8512329">average price on Yandex.Money is ¬£ 11,990</a> . <br><br><blockquote>  Article 24 p.2 of the law on consumer protection: <br>  When replacing a product of inadequate quality with the same product of another brand (model, article), if the price of the product to be replaced is lower than the price of the product provided in return, the consumer must pay the difference in prices;  in case the price of the goods to be replaced is higher than the price of the goods provided in return, the difference in prices is paid to the consumer.  The price of the goods to be replaced is determined at the time of its replacement, and if the consumer‚Äôs demand is not satisfied by the seller, the price of the goods to be replaced and the price of the goods to be transferred in return are determined at the time of the court‚Äôs decision to replace the goods. </blockquote><br>  I write about this in those.  support for what I get an answer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/99d/3ca/0ca/99d3ca0caea04f4988dcdb4c9c428d4f.png"><br><br>  I did not get a love story with Logitech.  The devices are smart, but as they say, there is one thing. <br><br>  What I have in the end: <br><ul><li>  Poor quality device sent to the manufacturer; </li><li>  The inability to repair it under warranty.  A replacement is possible only for a device with a market value of 2 times lower, and this is a bad option. </li></ul><br>  My plans are to try to pick up the keyboard from the service center and repair it myself (if it were not for this quality forcing helpdesk on the network, I would not have thought of carrying it to the SC) or taking the money and buying an avito used mechanic. <br><br>  Question: Who is to blame?  Exchange rate, due to which the technology has become 2 times more expensive.  A DNS that no longer sells such keyboards is available in Vladivostok, but they can only be sent within the Urals region.  Or Logitech, which can not replace the broken goods. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#9CC5DB">Bonus - subjective reviews of my devices</font> </h3><br><h4>  <font color="#9CC5DB">Logitech G710 +</font> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/906/5ec/3ba/9065ec3ba0026d31b40d87aa06559ef3.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The hero of today Logitech G710 + is quite a controversial device in many ways. <br>  This is the first mechanical keyboard from Logitech.

But I have never met with problems because of which they are being driven by a wave of negativity on the network (dormant wheel and micro buttons). <br>  It's a pity A4Tech refused to use the D-pad in their mice, as in F6.  I have not seen anything comparable so far that there are enough buttons and they are not confused.  Razer Naga and Logitech M600 are not the most intuitive solutions. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/48b/120/2bf/48b1202bf374ad3e2cca625c3853dbe8.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/390777/">https://habr.com/ru/post/390777/</a></p>
