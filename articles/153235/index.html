  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Backup Academy: online courses and certification for backup virtual machines</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today we want to tell you about Backup Academy, a resource for beginners in the field of virtualization: free online video courses and virtual machine backup certification for VMware and Hyper-V.  Courses are aimed at studying the basic technologies, principles and methods of backup of virtual machines, and not to review specific products or solutions of manufacturers in this area. <br><br><h4>  Who is Backup Academy focused on? </h4><br>  When creating the Backup Academy, we thought first of all about those IT specialists who want to develop their careers in the field of virtualization, but do not yet have sufficient experience and knowledge in this area. <br>  The courses will be interesting for both completely newbies and those who are already working with VMware and Hyper-V.  All videos and the resource itself are in English. <br><br><h4>  What are the courses about? </h4><br>  Backup Academy covers basic technologies and types of backups: how they differ from each other, how they can be performed, how one or another method is better / worse than another, what conditions must be met for successful backup and recovery, and much more.  In focus, of course, backup and data recovery.

    <h4>  What does certification give? </h4><br>  Backup Academy provides an opportunity to pass a certification exam for free, if successfully passed, the user receives a personal certificate with the status of Backup Academy Certified Professional.  A person with such a status is quite ready to study further and obtain narrower certifications offered by VMware, Hyper-V and other vendors already aimed at obtaining narrower specialized knowledge, advanced level.  Successfully passing the Academy Backup exam does not guarantee that you will never ‚Äúfill up‚Äù all your backups, but at least gives you a basic set of knowledge and skills for beginners who do not know why, for example, deduplication is good, and why testing backups can and should be done. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Who is behind all this? </h4><br>  Backup Academy is a resource sponsored by Veeam Software.  But this does not mean that the courses tell only about the products of this company or strongly hint at the purchase of these products.  On the contrary, in the Backup Academy we do not mention the names of vendors precisely in order not to get into the details of specific products, because they are all very different and solve different tasks in completely different ways.  First of all, professors of Bacup Academy explain and talk about the basic technologies and principles that are used by all vendors.  The course is read by the best professionals in their field, the owners of VMware and Microsoft expert statuses - Eric Sibert, David Davis, Rick Vanover, Greg Shields and others. <br><br><h4>  Where and how to start? </h4><br>  It's very simple - go to the website <a href="http://www.backupacademy.com/%3Fad%3Dhabr">http://www.backupacademy.com</a> and start watching videos on topics of interest to you, registration is not required for this.  You can read blog posts, study professors, download podcasts into a player or look through presentations.  As soon as you realize that you have already learned something, and maybe even are ready to pass the exam, try your hand on a small test of 10 questions.  If you can pass, then it makes sense to try to pass the certification exam.  It consists of 30+ questions, no time limit for the passage.  We ask users to register at this stage, according to the results of a successful delivery, each receives a personalized certificate with the status of Backup Academy Certified Professional. <br><br><h4>  What's next? </h4><br>  Backup Academy is not in place, there are lots of things that we have not yet told!  Therefore, we are constantly adding new videos to the existing course, we are looking for new experts who are ready to share knowledge, and we are happy to give feedback to users who are writing what they lack in the course now and what videos they would like to see on our site on the site in the future.  We periodically update the questions in the exam, which we inform our students, if someone wants to check themselves again and / or renew the certificate.  Our newsletter (all registered users receive it) and participation in our groups on social networks (more on this below) will help to stay abreast of the latest changes. <br><br><h4>  How to contact us? </h4><br>  Very simple: <br>  - write us an email at <a href="">feedback@backupacademy.com</a> <br>  - write to us on <a href="https://twitter.com/BckpAcademy">twitter.com/BckpAcademy</a> or Facebook <a href="http://facebook.com/backup.academy">http://facebook.com/backup.academy</a> <br>  - ask your question on the site by filling out a simple form <a href="http://www.backupacademy.com/feedback.html%3Fad%3Dhabr">http://www.backupacademy.com/feedback.html</a> <br><br>  Virtualization, protection and data recovery are among the hottest topics and areas in the market today.  Even if you are not familiar with this area, there are no problems!  You can safely begin your training at Backup Academy (free, easy to use and independent) and further, depending on preferences and professional needs, to invest in professional certifications and training from specific vendors.
