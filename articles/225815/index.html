What happened at the YaC / M conference, and why this could be an important step in the development of Runet</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello!  My name is Alexey Avdey, I am the head of Yandex.Market.  Today I want to tell you what the main presentation at the past <a href="http://tech.yandex.ru/events/yac/m2014/">YaC / m was about</a> and why the updated Yandex.Market will bring the e-commerce market in our country to a new stage of development. <br><br>  The market is changing the format.  Now it will not only be a product search service.  We will be the arbiter between sellers and buyers: we will guarantee the integrity of purchases and will make people stop fearing that their money will be stolen.  In addition, based on the MultiShip data, we will begin to show the time and cost of delivery for each product in each region.  We will allow even small players to use technologies that change the market. <br><br> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/yandex/blog/225815/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5d7/477/6fd/5d74776fd9a81fc4058b43a64481ac79.jpg"></a>

      When we launched the product search service in 2000, we had 70 stores.  The e-commerce market in Russia received a strong impetus and actively developed.  Now more than 15,000 stores are connected to Yandex.Market, 80% of which are small.  According to TNS Web-Index, about 20 million customers come to the service per month.  The time has come when new tools are needed to continue this growth. <br><br>  Much has happened over the years: we <a href="">bought Multiship software and invest in its development</a> , gain experience in quality control of stores and create technologies that will help not only us, but also users and partners.  What path we have traveled and what will be further thanks to this, read under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Many Yandex services ‚Äî not just the Market ‚Äî have helped grow the e-commerce market in Russia.  At one time, stores had big problems with the availability of goods, and prices for it were constantly changing.  The Market quality service helped to improve the quality of the store information and collect feedback.  Yandex.Metrica made web analytics and efficiency calculations available to any store, Yandex.Direct eased access to customers, and Yandex.Webmaster helped newcomers with search engine optimization. <br><br><h4>  Buyer Protection System </h4><br>  The customer protection service will resolve the disputes between the customer and the store.  If the buyer is not satisfied with the response, he will be able to file a claim.  Within three days after filing a claim, the store will have to resolve the issue.  If this does not happen, the buyer will be able to attract an independent arbiter from Yandex.Market.  The arbitrator will communicate with both parties, request documents, additional information and make a decision.  If the store is wrong, the buyer is guaranteed to return the money. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a5b/95f/b7a/a5b95fb7a877b4821f76390aaca1b36c.jpg"><br><br>  Paid goods in Russia is not always easy to return.  The Yandex.Market Quality Service, based on customer feedback, has previously paid attention to how stores fulfill laws, and applied sanctions to violators.  But now each user will be able to directly contact us through a special interface - immediately after placing the order and another 14 days after delivery.  Thanks to her, a person will be able to find out everything necessary about the order or solve a controversial issue by resorting to the help of an independent arbiter. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/185/94e/4bc/18594e4bcc34faeea30d0d05f59534b4.jpg"><br>  Buyers will be able to see the history of their orders, their status, history of payments and correspondence with stores. <br><br><h4>  Logistics </h4><br>  In addition, the online store is not always easy to negotiate with carriers - often have to attract a few.  We will solve this problem for both parties - the organization of the delivery itself will be able to take on MultiShip, an aggregator of Russian cargo carriers, with whom we began working at the beginning of the year. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/72e/760/030/72e7600308b3ad8b6237249fc54f2c84.png"><br><br>  Now, 83% of the Runet‚Äôs audience live in the regions and this share is growing.  A complex delivery system and distrust of those who will implement it, greatly influence the desire to buy or not to buy something on the Internet.  The person does not understand how the product will go and how long it will take.  Now he will immediately see the timeline for his region. <br><br><h4>  Technology </h4><br>  Yandex has data and machine learning.  We will give all shops the opportunity to offer their products on the Market through a system of personal recommendations.  And they are able to show not only banal dependencies like ‚Äúphone - case‚Äù.  As told on YaC <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/bobuk/" class="user_link">bobuk</a> , at some point the sellers noticed that with expensive plasma panels they often buy coffee makers.  And now in large electronics stores, the panels and coffee makers are located in adjacent areas.  But real magic begins when sellers begin to take into account those factors that are outside of e-commerce.  For example, the weather in the city of the buyer.  If it rains tomorrow, you can offer him a moisture-resistant shoe polish or rubber boots in advance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/40c/fa6/c1a/40cfa6c1a1fdf3d1a20ce1cd1d7349bc.jpg"><br><br>  In the market of online commerce, as in almost any, there are three categories of sellers: large, medium and small.  The first have large budgets for promotion, the creation of their own recommendation systems, a lot of their own data.  But, as I said above, 80% of our partners on the Market are small shops that do not have such resources.  By the way, only half of the stores that use Yandex.Metric sets up goals in it.  Of course, here you can still think that this glass is half full or half empty, but this omission of efficiency does not contribute.  In addition, many stores burn money as a marketing budget, which does not guarantee them an increase in sales. <br><br>  Now, on average, in the market, shops pay from 2% of the commission for attracted order and from 3% for processing money.  In total, it turns out that in order to fulfill the order and get the money, you need to pay from 5% commission for the order.  Yandex.Market will charge only 3% commission from shops for the order and money for it.  This is the CPA model (Cost Per Action), which we have already talked about.  If the store wants, it can continue to be placed only on the model of CPC (Cost Per Click).  His offers will be shown as usual - without the possibility of ordering and payment.  To make a purchase, the user will have to go to the store website. <br><br>  The goal of all our changes is to help Russian online stores solve their main problems: to get rid of ‚Äúhanging out‚Äù money, not to narrow the circle of their customers because of difficulties with logistics, to reduce the cost of attracting a customer and gain his trust.  Such problems are particularly difficult to overcome small shops.  Now they will have the same opportunities as the giants.  And users will benefit. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/225815/">https://habr.com/ru/post/225815/</a></p>
