  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tibbo in creating GIS utilities</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Housing and communal services is one of the most socially significant areas for the application of automation technologies.  A number of problems have matured in the region, which led to the signing of a federal law on the creation of a state information system for housing and communal services.  This article will discuss the possibility of using Tibbo technologies in such projects. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3bb/a63/699/3bba63699bb14da391c03e66b42e4155.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The following are just some of the problems in the housing and utilities sector: <br><ul><li>  Inconsistency of charges in receipts to actual services rendered or resources consumed; </li><li>  Unscrupulous attitude of market players leads to non-optimal delivery of services (for example, the effect of "overheating"). </li><li>  The cost of manually collecting meter readings by service companies. </li><li>  The lack of a unified information base and an opaque scheme of work of the participants of business processes do not allow to plan budget allocation wisely, feedback from the consumer is lost. </li><li>  And without the means of monitoring the technical condition of the facilities, the response time to emergency situations may be delayed to unacceptable values. </li></ul><br>  This and much more pushes for the creation of dispatching and control systems in the housing and utilities sector. <br><br>  In some regions of the Russian Federation, automated systems are already functioning.  However, the absence of a legislative base does not oblige players to use the proposed funds.  Moreover, the difference in the methodologies for collecting and processing information from these systems makes it difficult to scale the solution to the interregional level.  And this does not allow responsible federal agencies to consider the problems of the housing and utilities segment in a comprehensive manner. <br><br>  As a result, the urgent problems led to the signing of the <a href="http://graph.document.kremlin.ru/page.aspx%3F3643947">federal law No. 209-FZ of July 21, 2014 ‚ÄúOn the State Information System of the Housing and Communal Services‚Äù</a> (GIS <a href="http://graph.document.kremlin.ru/page.aspx%3F3643947">Housing and Public</a> Utilities).  From the point of view of consumers, the adoption of this law introduces convenience and ‚Äútransparency‚Äù in the process of providing utilities.  Through a personal account, the user can not only see the costs of resources and pay them conveniently for themselves, but also leave the complaint online (for example, if the receipt has a cleaning position, but in reality it was not).  To update the data and prevent irregularities in the system, a mechanism for checking the readings is provided: consumers transmit readings of metering devices (for example, water consumption), the controlling authority compares the sum of the readings of individual devices with the total house consumption values.  The difference between these indicators is the basis for launching the process for identifying violations.  According to the law, since January 1, 2017, the consumer is not obliged to pay for receipts issued outside the GIS housing and communal services or receipts, the readings of which differ from the electronic copy.  Access to the system will be provided within a single portal of public services.

    <h1>  Automation housing </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/158/141/ebc/158141ebc7fd49e3b5551c09cc28999c.bmp" align="right"><br>  In the context of the GIS utilities system, we can take a closer look at the meter reading metering subsystem.  This subsystem is a classic task of housing and utilities management, which can be divided into several levels: <br>  1. Lower level.  Control instrumentation, automated control devices.  At this level, the selection of counters, calculators, PLC, is determined by what protocols the device will transmit information. <br>  2. Communication.  The choice of technologies and tools for the organization of the main and duplicate communication channels.  It also defines the devices for negotiation (gateways) of protocols and interfaces. <br>  3. Dispatching.  Selection of application software that collects and processes data. <br>  4. Integration.  Providing communication with other subsystems and systems of the upper level. <br><br>  In general, the integrator can choose any solution to create such a system.  However, within the framework of GIS utilities, there are additional requirements that determine the approach to dispatching.  For example, paragraph 14 of the <a href="http://regulation.gov.ru/project/19148.html%3Fpoint%3Dview_project%26stage%3D2%26stage_id%3D13191">technological requirements of the GIS housing and communal services</a> determines that the system must be laid down mechanisms for the possible expansion of functionality.  Paragraph 6 of the same document reads: <br>  ‚Äú6.  The system must operate in continuous mode.  The operator provides: <br>  a) uninterrupted round-the-clock operation of the system 7 days a week, 365/366 days a year; <br>  b) fast (no more than one hour) recovery of the system and its parts in case of failure of their work; <br>  c) constant monitoring of events and the current state of the system and its parts, allowing continuous monitoring of the availability of the software and hardware system and the current state of equipment use, as well as immediately notifying the system operator about the failure of the system and its parts; <br>  d) monitoring and analysis of current performance and other parameters of the system and its parts, timely identification of threats that limit its performance and stability ... " <br><br>  However, many objects already have established automation.  And integrators are tasked to ensure interaction with the GIS utilities, while the existing scheme should not disrupt their work. <br><br>  Given the above, there are obvious problems in creating a universal dispatch system for its implementation in the framework of the GIS utilities: <br><ul><li>  Collection of information on various protocols (depending on the already installed measuring equipment at the facility). </li><li>  Selection of the main communication channel (Ethernet, Wi-Fi, GPRS, radio channel, etc.). </li><li>  The coordination of equipment interfaces with the main communication channels. </li><li>  Creation of backup (backup) communication channels. </li><li>  Organization of the new information flow, without violating the previous scheme of work. </li><li>  Logging service information for the subsequent resolution of problem situations. </li><li>  Online monitoring of the state of automation devices. </li><li>  The ability to quickly detect and solve problem situations. </li><li>  Fast build-up functionality in the future. </li><li>  Flexible software platform that provides information gathering on any possible protocol, custom logic, etc. </li></ul><br>  With Tibbo technology, you can solve most of the problems that arise.  Consider briefly the possibilities of our decisions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f64/436/281/f644362818e843e1b4d1c894590ef53d.JPG" align="right"><br><h1>  Transfer of instrument readings via Ethernet (Internet) </h1><br>  The classic situation at the facility is the remote collection of meter readings.  In this case, instruments usually use serial interfaces RS232, RS485.  To solve this problem, we propose the use of a simple interface converter DS1100.  The converter can operate both in server mode and in client mode.  Controlled data transfer rate, setting of bit timings, choice of TCP / UDP protocols and other flexible parameters allow to transparently transmit information flows regardless of the protocols used.  In this case, the protocol is decrypted on the server.  <a href="http://tibbo.ru/products/item/4/7/">DS1100</a> is capable of transmitting data over a local network or via the Internet. <br><br><h1>  Duplication of the communication channel </h1><br>  Often a monitoring system is already installed at the facility.  For example, a GPRS modem for remote data transmission is connected to a heat meter.  The integrator needs to organize a new communication channel to integrate the system with the GIS utilities.  In this case, the use of a <a href="http://tibbo.ru/products/item/4/8/">DS1101</a> multiport converter is <a href="http://tibbo.ru/products/item/4/8/">recommended</a> .  The converter, having received data from the metering device, duplicates the transmission to the second serial port (GPRS modem) and to the Ethernet line.  If necessary, you can specify a different work scenario: continuously transmit data through one of the channels, but when a request appears on a priority (for example, GPRS), orient the flow of information to it. <br>  In the case of primary automation of an object, using a <b>DS1101</b> or <b>DS1102 converter</b> , an Ethernet data transmission channel is formed with the possibility of creating a backup communication line (GRPS, radio channel, Wi-Fi, etc.).  In practice, on the basis of Tibbo devices, you can create almost any scenario for organizing communication nodes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/25d/b06/e16/25db06e16e1542dc9afa096ce1669516.JPG" align="right"><br><h1>  Expansion of functionality </h1><br>  All previous cases can also be implemented on the <a href="http://tibbo.ru/products/10/">Tibbo Project System</a> hardware platform.  The modularity of the TPS system allows you to put into the system the possibility of hardware expansion functionality.  For example, if you need to monitor dry contacts in the future, this is accomplished by installing appropriate tibbits (I / O modules) on the board and a slight change in firmware.  The device does not even have to be removed from the object: all manipulations are carried out at the installation site, and the flashing procedure is implemented remotely.  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/scancode/blog/194862/">Here</a> you can see in more detail what the TPS system is. <br><br><h1>  Protocol gateway </h1><br>  In any of the above cases, we assume that the entire information flow exists ‚Äúoutside the protocols‚Äù, i.e.  direct bitwise data transfer is implemented.  Such a method is not always applicable.  For example, to reduce traffic through the GSM module, you can ‚Äúparse‚Äù the ModBus protocol from the heat meter (or another device) and send only useful information to the server.  This task can be performed on any Tibbo module.  Free programming allows you to implement a local data collection server: polling metering devices using a native protocol, caching data when there is no connection, transferring readings to the server.  A special case of this solution is the hardware gateway of the protocols, such as <b>ModBusRTU / ModBusTCP</b> .  Thus, Tibbo devices allow not only to realize communication channels, but also eliminate the problem of "compatibility" of various metering devices and external systems. <br><br>  In addition, programming Tibbo modules allows you to create local system logic, giving it more intelligence: monitoring broken lines, validity of received values, data caching, escalation of alarms and events according to specified scenarios, development of control actions and much more.  Communication devices are transformed into full PLCs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/da4/7aa/6e9/da47aa6e972e4ad0b8be2c71f7f15ed2.JPG" align="right"><br><h1>  Logging </h1><br>  If problems arise, a request from users may arrive with a significant delay (up to several days).  As a result, it is not always possible to understand the causes of non-standard situations, since  there are no log data: which system parameters were set at the moment of the problem, which commands came from the meters, which request the server sent, etc.  Keeping a complete event log allows you to sort out the problem even after a considerable time. <br><br>  When using Tibbo technology, it is proposed to use data logging using the external monitoring system <b>AggreGate</b> .  Tibbo devices transmit to the server their own state and all parameters of the connected devices.  AggreGate records this data on the server, providing convenient access to it through the desktop client or web interface.  History retention time, archiving, database type, polling period, and other parameters are flexibly configured.  In the event of a communication interruption, the modules are able to locally cache the status information and transfer it to the server at the time the link is restored. <br><br><h1>  Dispatching on AggreGate </h1><br>  When dispatching, a specialized software is installed on the server that collects information from local devices, processes it and provides generalized data to the operator or other systems.  In some cases, for these purposes, SCADA systems are used, which often have redundant, unclaimed functionality, and functions useful for the housing and utilities sector may be absent.  The Tibbo solution is based on the SCADA system, but modified specifically for use in the utilities sector - this is <b><a href="http://tibbo.ru/products/item/11/52/">AggreGate Meter Reading</a> .</b> <br><br>  <b>AggreGate Meter Reading</b> has all the necessary tools for organizing the convenient work of the dispatcher, as well as for integration with other subsystems.  For example, not all classic SCADA can work with trends or have reporting tools.  In AggreGate, this is implemented on a low platform level.  AggreGate + Tibbo devices provide flexible hardware and software for automation of utilities: equipment diagnostics, early detection of problems, escalation of alarms and events, notification of responsible personnel, logging of system data, flexible work with measured values ‚Äã‚Äã(history, aggregation, statistics, trends, complex calculations, graphs, reports, etc.).  Open API functions, technical support from developers, and competent documentation allow AggreGate to be integrated in horizontal and vertical directions. <br><br>  Some advantages of AggreGate: <br><ul><li>  Support for standard protocols (M-Bus, Modbus, OPC, SNMP, etc.). </li><li>  Metering and control devices with other protocols are easily integrated using Tibbo's programmable hardware solutions. </li><li>  Instrument readings can be imported from other systems through SOAP.  Another way to "connect" systems is to connect to an external SQL database. </li><li>  Flexible, customizable data collection and storage history rules. </li><li>  Built-in tools for alerts, reporting, schedules. </li><li>  Forecasting based on correlations, trends and trends allows operators to be warned in advance if consumption growth is about to cross the threshold of the Service Level Agreement (SLA). </li><li>  Detailed analysis of peak values. </li><li>  Export readings in various formats. </li><li>  An open source API for integrating with billing and analytical systems and providing information to customers and service providers. </li><li>  Ability to work based on OEM agreement. </li></ul><br><br>  Using Tibbo technology we get a complete and harmonious hardware and software complex, represented by one whole.  This approach allows you to instantly fix abnormal situations and promptly respond to a malfunction of the system nodes.  Due to this, the fulfillment of the conditions for the requirements of the GIS utilities is achieved: ‚Äúquick (no more than one hour) recovery of the system and its parts in the event of their failure‚Äù.  Logging status information allows you to analyze emergency situations, make adjustments to the system. <br><br>  The combination of the hardware flexibility of the TPS system and the ability to remotely flash the devices (using AggreGate) ensures the GIS utilities requirements for future functionality enhancement.  Tibbit with the GSM modem function allows you to create a primary or backup communication channel based on the communication lines of cellular operators without using external modems.  Thus, most of the emerging problems of automation of housing and public utilities are solved on the <a href="http://tibbo.ru/articles/gis_gkh/">basis of technologies of a</a> single vendor, which significantly simplifies commercial processes and system operation. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/245189/">https://habr.com/ru/post/245189/</a></p>
