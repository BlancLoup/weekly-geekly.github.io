  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The story of one nonsense</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A small story about xp_cmdshell, a stored procedure from Microsoft Sql Server. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It is on my home computer I have Sql Server 2008 Express, I use it for developing various Bd.  It took me somehow to contact her remotely.  I enabled the TCP protocol on a non-standard port, set up a standard Windows firewall, turned off sa by cutting in a separate account for editing only one database.  Everything was set up - it worked great. <br><br>  And once I urgently needed access to a single file on my home computer, and where it is and how it was called was forgotten (the file was old).  The situation was such that I had no other access to the computer, neither standard rdp, nor any third-party applications.  At the disposal was only a wife who can do with a computer on orders, in principle, anything, except perhaps an independent search for the desired file. <br><br>  All I did was to leave her session and log in using my account (reset her SMS password), enable Managment Studio and activate sa login with password 123456 (I hoped for only a couple of hours).  When the procedure was completed - I could easily log in under sa.  After that, the first thing I did was execute xp_cmdshell, and I started searching for the file through the console.  After a couple of hours, the file was found and copied to the place accessible to the wife.  Having received the file via Skype, I safely forgot about the ‚Äúhole formed‚Äù.

      After that, several days passed.  Thank God for this time the home computer was not used.  Just today, after I sat down at the computer, the antivirus went berserk: for 10 minutes it blocked the file from the System32 folder 3 times.  According to the description, this turned out to be one of the viruses of this family <a href="">www.securelist.com/ru/descriptions/115419/Trojan-Downloader.BAT.Ftp.ab</a> .  I couldn‚Äôt understand for a long time what it could manage to write to this folder: I never turn off uac, I‚Äôm checking all the programs that require administrator rights, I‚Äôm not able to see the virus so easily.  Monitoring the System32 folder did not give a result - the file did not have time to appear in it, as the antivirus immediately blocked it.  The standard Windows Task Manager did not show any anomalous activity ... but I also have Process Explorer.  After launching it, the cmd child process from the sql server service, which in turn launched the ftp process, immediately caught the eye.  I immediately remembered that I didn‚Äôt disable sa, much less xp_cmdshell.  First of all, I cut down the access in the firewall, and only then disconnected sa, and then xp_cmdshell - after that, the antivirus calmed down. <br><br>  In all this situation, I was struck by only one thing - how quickly we scanned an open non-standard port and tried to take advantage of this "hole." <br><br>  The conclusion is clear one - the fool himself.  However, if it were not for the antivirus, I probably didn‚Äôt remember about open access to the computer for a long time. <br><br>  And for those who still doubt, I want to say that any hole in your computer can be detected by someone at the same moment as it appears. <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> Eh, why I don‚Äôt watch Event Log so often, attempts to access SQL Server began immediately after opening a port.  Just a month before these events, attempts were made to select passwords for non-existent logins.  Only when the login sa was opened - these attempts could be crowned with some success.  All ip from the internal grid of the provider - apparently either someone has a virus, or someone has a good trouble ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/92528/">https://habr.com/ru/post/92528/</a></p>
