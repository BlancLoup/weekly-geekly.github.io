The beginning is smooth, many interesting things are expected today, including Max Spiridonov, Igor Denisov (Mio), as well as additional annealing from Garev Vladimir from grape.ru about viral marketing. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <strong>The boom of social services: the position of the investor - Yaroslav Greshilov (inVenture)</strong> <br><br>  80% of applications submitted in inVenture - various variations of social networks.

      The main problems of such applications (often they do not even go into consideration) <br>  - People can not clearly define the purpose of the stated startup. <br>  - ‚ÄúWe will have a super project, because everyone will come to us.‚Äù  Everyone will come to us, because we have a super-project ‚Äù- the eternal question of chicken and egg. <br>  - To do everything at once, a kind of combine on which only your friends will hang out. <br><br>  The criterion for assessing the success of the application is the answer to the question ‚Äúwhere will the first users come from?‚Äù. <br><br>  The main asset of the social service is not fashionable fiches, but the audience.  Create the basic functionality and begin to develop an audience, completing the functionality.  The Internet allows it. <br><br>  Do not think how to immediately monetize, make the service as useful as possible to more users.  Services that start earning immediately grow much slower than money-free ones in the first stage. <br><br>  We first grow to a certain point, then we start to monetize, at the same time continuing almost exponential growth. <br><br>  Investments will go when the growth of service.  How you grow it, how much and with what speed, so much the faster it will acquire a monetary equivalent. <br><br>  "Work on the audience, and then it will work for you."  Bring your hands in the first people, otherwise you risk to miss in Central Asia.  Look for fans and recruit them. <br><br>  And do not forget about the floating positioning during the entire growth of the service. <br><br>  Most liked the term ‚Äúfeature-cutting‚Äù: first, think of everything that the service will be able to do in 2 years, and then cut off everything that is possible.  Leave only what is needed to run the project.  Freshly retold and for many is still a revelation. <br><br>  The report is excellent.  I recommend to read later. <br><br>  <em><strong>Where to get the materials - I will write later, by the end of the day.</strong></em>  <em><strong>But the organizers promise all presentations and texts of reports, as well as videos on smotri.com.</strong></em> <br><br>  <em>update @ 10: 50</em> <br><br>  <strong>How to build a report for sale - Maxim Spiridonov (Roiber)</strong> <br><br>  This report was at RIT 2008, but I did not listen to it then - glad that I had another chance. <br><br>  Considered memori.ru, sold last year to RBC. <br><br>  We studied how to choose a niche with the help of market research, choose the best technical means, and considered the entrepreneurial side.  For young geeks, creating, for example, an LLC is a whole problem.  Start over. <br><br>  Create a service iteratively.  IMHO is a mantra for experienced people) <br><br>  Make the first ‚Äúappearance‚Äù, declare yourself, promise new features, having received which, users will become happy and loyal.  Encourage the generation of ideas discussions - this is the cheapest way. <br><br>  The final feeling - as a couple in the university stayed.  But interesting, although much is banal. <br><br>  <em>update @ 11: 43</em> <br><br>  <strong>How to start a startup with minimal investment - Anton Mazirin (free-lance.ru)</strong> <br><br>  The report is in the style of an informal approach, because "in books one thing, in practice, the other."  Key points: <br><br>  1. Where is the idea: news, copying with minimal improvements, divine insight. <br>  2. How much money is needed?  Find a balance between inspiration and the necessary means.  Large investments do not guarantee success at all. <br>  3. Limit yourself: be unhappy, sleep badly and eat)) There are a lot of illustrative examples, mainly about monks and writing ideas in the middle of the night on scraps of toilet paper.  Most unusual item <br>  4. How to start doing: formulate an intention, put on like-minded people (2-3 people - at least to start a startup), finally, start to realize. <br><br>  5. In discussions with partners (the word IMHO is dumb in some ways), look for points of contact.  And everyone in the head a lot of trash and tails, which should get rid of. <br><br>  "A lot of divine light - a lot of trash" <br>  "A lot of people - a lot of controversy" <br><br>  6. Open (release) when you almost completely exhaled and implemented all the "points of contact".  Then draw energy from users, get feedback. <br><br>  How to develop further - users will say.  Let them participate in the process, increase their loyalty. <br><br>  The report was a success.  In the end, we looked a little at how and for whom to sell, at what stage to start thinking about it.  In detail - in the text of the report (I hope they will all be available on the conference website). <br><br>  <em>update @ 12:25</em> <br><br>  <strong>Problems of Russian startups: the struggle for an idea or a further path to monetization - Vasily Butin (‚ÄúEter‚Äù, web2people)</strong> <br><br>  From 500 ideas 100 prototypes are obtained.  After reviewing the prototypes in the context of monetization, 50 ideas remain.  After talking with investors, there are 10 truly travel business ideas. <br><br>  Come up with trumps and make sure that your idea is protected from theft.  Read about it in the articles on intellectual property rights. <br><br>  Considered in detail funding at an early stage - how many percent of the stupaps whose finances are used.  I remember the figure of 17% - that is how many startups manage on their own.  The question about the source of such data remained a little incomprehensible to me.  It seems that statistics on the most successful. <br><br>  Insider photos from the ‚Äúincubator‚Äù meetings were demonstrated.  The successes of 2 Ukrainian startups after the last meeting with British investors are commented.  By the way, such a startup center will soon be organized in St. Petersburg, so you still have time to prepare applications for participation. <br><br>  The potential market, the team and the stated goals and methods - this is what you need to go to the investor. <br><br>  Web2people.net - an overview of services.  What is remembered: they give 100k to hands for 3 months at once, targeting the result. <br><br>  <em>update @ 12:45</em> <br><br>  <strong>Long tail in the development of social networks - Dmitry Linkov (Mann, Ivanov and Ferber publishing house)</strong> <br><br>  The main idea - in the near future, the development of the Internet will be directed to a variety of niche social networks based on such major tools as Google Social API, Facebook. <br><br>  It's a little incomprehensible to me how these tools can now be used in Russia - for the time being, we have only laid out vkontakte with our API, yesterday BobrDobr distinguished itself.  And the largest platforms proposed by the presenters in Russia are not yet used. <br><br>  It turned out a heated discussion.  It was noted that, in fact, thematic communities based on forums and other traditional ways of communication, voting are not very different from thematic social networks.  For me, so different in the user base and standards.  I will give an example: <br><br>  all use the mail, someone is in the club of car enthusiasts, someone is interested in cooking.  You can navigate through your hobby-sowing without any procrastination in the form of registration, authorization, once again entering your data.  Therefore, openId and all other cross-domain identification services turn classic thematic communities into thematic social networks. <br><br>  Gone for dinner) I will soon <br><br>  <em>update @ 14: 20</em> <br><br>  The report of Igor Denisov was postponed half an hour later, therefore now: <br><br>  <strong>10 Top Web 2.0 Trends - Damir Khalilov (Green PR Agency)</strong> <br><br>  1. Corporate blogs <br>  2. Multimedia search <br>  3. Uzkotematicheskiy social, because: <br>  - high density of general social programs <br>  - the lack of a ‚Äúrod‚Äù of general social programs <br>  - natural targeting of highly mathematical social programs <br>  4. Show business will use social networks <br>  5. Advertising on blogs will outgrow the stage of "custom posts" (now Utia-Utia at the mention of any brand) <br>  6. Big business will come to social networks <br>  7. Online communities will fight spam in a new way. <br>  8. Internet marketers will be trained <br>  9. Countering theft of visitors <br>  10. Black Internet PR campaigns will be bigger <br><br>  Lecture report step by step.  Things important, filed dry. <br><br>  <em>update @ 14:30</em> <br><br>  <strong>Legends and Myths web 2.0 - Dmitry Andriyashkin (Butik2.0)</strong> <br><br>  You just have to see it.  I will not describe, because I can not laugh like that and write at the same time) <br><br>  update @ 15: 50 <br><br>  Despite the disgusting cold rainy weather, the mood is excellent.  People drink coffee and tea with delicious cakes, talk a lot.  Interesting conversations and sensible thoughts - I am happy from the awareness of involvement in such an event.  It can be seen that people thinking in the Runet business are still not mythical creatures) The atmosphere is very homely and benevolent, the organizers work clearly - polite, sensible answers on organizational issues, no pathos and neglect, everything is concise and relevant.  Very usable plates for speakers, which show the remaining time of the report.  I have not seen them used before. <br><br>  Ask to fill out and submit the questionnaire - get a funny T-shirt.  The questionnaire deserves a separate word - points according to 3 criteria for all reports.  Reports are in full accordance with the schedule in the halls - to fill a pleasure.  ProfyClub has a lot to learn. <br><br>  Fashionable words "couloir" is almost inaudible, but everyone communicates wherever possible.  The most fun stories - according to the tradition on the porch for smoke breaks) <br><br>  <em>update @ 16:50</em> <br><br>  <strong>Demonstration of opportunities for all of WeMe.Ru on the example of the community for producing ideas ‚ÄúTerritory of Ideas‚Äù - Konstantin Bocharsky (The Secret of the Firm)</strong> <br><br>  We all first reveal the needs, give rise to the hypothesis of functionality.  Then we make it all into the community.  A community is formed around the content on a specific topic, or, for example, around the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe beautiful. <br><br>  If you have a blog with thousands of hosts per day and every day you make them use as a tool for interacting around your topic with some WordPress, which is not designed for interaction.  A blog is like a notebook that will do, but to communicate with users (in this case, subscribers), a more convenient platform is needed to discuss thoughts and ideas.  And in the report Konstantin on his own blog "Territory of Ideas" shows why you should use vsevteme.ru. <br><br>  Description of the Territory of Ideas: <br><br>  1. ‚ÄúSearch for intangible assets‚Äù - ideas, trends, opportunities, and, most importantly, like-minded people. <br>  2. A community where participants are united around ideas (projects, trends, phenomena) that they want to capitalize.  And their mission is to turn ideas into a product. <br><br>  They talked about the audience: thinkers &amp; doers, inspiration and realization of ideas.  An example for consideration is the Blog Idea and the ‚Äústicky‚Äù Central Asia.  The most valuable for such CA are ‚Äúirritants‚Äù - the objects of discussion. <br><br>  Central Asia needs: <br>  1. sources of life.  Starting point for generating ideas <br>  2. Draw ideas from others <br>  3. Networking <br>  4. Search for resources <br>  5. Team building <br><br>  The division of target users into types of users: a start-up, a trend watcher, a reader and the determination of their needs. <br><br>  They told about insights on vKontakte and how Nikolai Mityushin conducted ‚Äúpersonal interviews‚Äù with the leaders of the groups for ‚Äúall the topic‚Äù in order to understand what is happening inside these groups, how they are organized and interact, what they need. <br><br>  <strong><em>Speaker motto (from the parable about 3 teachers):</em></strong> <strong><em><br></em></strong>  <strong><em>- how to think</em></strong> <strong><em><br></em></strong>  <strong><em>- What to think about</em></strong> <strong><em><br></em></strong>  <strong><em>- how to turn thinking into action</em></strong> <br><br>  The report is interesting, more interesting is the resulting matrix of needs of user types - for sure it can already be found.  Who will find - I will fill in) A lot of food to analyze your own position, to analyze the needs of groups of users of any content project. <br><br>  Conclusion: small mercantile benefits - the engine of user activity within your social community.  If the element of the functionality of the service does not serve as a direct convenient to obtain at least a small benefit and enjoyment, the element is superfluous.  This is the decomposition of functionality and, accordingly, interfaces. <br><br>  The report did not end long; the next speaker even had to go to the next room.  Konstantin shared the results of a conversation with Sergey Brin, told about the history of development and analysis of Central Asia on LinkedIn. <br><br>  I am in ecstatic delight) <br><br>  <em>update @ 17:25</em> <br><br>  My poppy sits, there are no sockets near, so I will be brief. <br><br>  <strong>The development of social networks.</strong>  <strong>How to deal with surplus - Rustem Bogdanov (WebId)</strong> <br><br>  How do I work Russian TV socials: <br>  1. Copied <br>  2. Wondered "how to monetize" <br>  3. Put "mediyku" <br><br>  The main question is - is it possible to create your own truly new social startup in Russia?  So far, the reduced statistics (see later in the presentation on the conference website) is disappointing. <br><br>  We consider the aggregators, security, level and quality of services provided. <br><br>  The report was not impressed, because it was so floridly, skipping over and in small detail making a reservation, Rustem introduced the report into some kind of loop and had to be caught with difficulty. <br><br>  <em><strong>At this end, for nothing more is not expected.</strong></em>  <em><strong>Thank you for reading, participating, and reporting - the impressions are positive, the conference was a success.</strong></em> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/25995/">https://habr.com/ru/post/25995/</a></p>
