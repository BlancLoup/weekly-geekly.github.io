If you have not bought a good toy on the radio control, then it's time to give yourself a suitable model.  But, it is necessary to warn you in advance that it will not at all about radio-controlled toys.  ‚ÄúIPhone controlled‚Äù models are much more relevant now. <br><br><h5>  Helicopters </h5><br><h6>  Helo TC assault </h6><br>  Flying around the house "black sharks", of course will bring a lot of trouble, for sure they will cause the collapse of some stray heirloom.  But is it possible because of some unnecessary vase to cancel the flight?  Definitely not. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2f0/40b/1a9/2f040b1a957e569b18da79646176fc07.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h5>  Control </h5><br>  To control the flight, you need to download a special application in the AppStore.  Although the program has a user-friendly interface that allows you to quickly understand everything, the skill will come to you only with time.  Control attached to the position of the gyroscope - Motion, requires great skill.  Learning to fly better with an ordinary joystick, it will allow you to better navigate in space and less likely to get into emergency situations.  There is one very interesting function in the application, you can save up to three flight routes in memory and recreate them in the future with just one click of a button. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/73b/593/d22/73b593d2255a8a8a5e10ba63a902c88c.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Specifications </h5><br>  The toy is particularly durable and easily withstands hard falls and accidental collisions.

To release copies of Ferrari, the company even received a special license from a car company. <br><br>  Among the connoisseurs of this type of technology, these models are particularly popular.  This is not surprising: a toy, with external fragility, is in fact very durable and reliable.  The copy is made as detailed as possible: even the emergency gang works. <br><br>  It differs from models of this type by high speed and amazing maneuverability.  On Youtube you can see reviews of happy owners, though in English. <br><br><h5>  Control </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0e7/e6f/f80/0e7e6ff807c23fca08d9517a9844f14a.jpg"><br><br>  Of all the applications for managing miniature models, the most interesting is this option.  The design of the application simulates the Ferrari dashboard.  In the screenshot you can see two devices - this is a speedometer and a tachometer.  They are not made for beauty, at the time of movement they display the speed and number of revolutions.  The maximum speed is 10 meters per second, that is, 36 kilometers per hour, which is not at all bad for a miniature model.  You can control it with the help of a gyroscope and a joystick.  The first option for more advanced drivers, the second is familiar and understandable to all.  Want to avoid unnecessary scratches - learn to ride with a joystick. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/uprHWD8Ge8U&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjzSA7PlKa702e1vJp6AjUvlapkzw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The connection is not IR, but Bluetooth, so additional devices are not needed.
