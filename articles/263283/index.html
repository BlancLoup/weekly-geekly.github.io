  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Second life of servers or a couple words about refurbished solutions</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>Hi Habr!</b>  A couple of weeks ago, a great <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/banderolka/blog/253108/">publication</a> was published on Geektimes about the purchase of refurbished (restored) electronics, where they ‚Äúon the fingers‚Äù explained what kind of goods, how and by whom they are restored, and most importantly, how beneficial this approach is.  Comments on the publication speak for themselves, but the article says more about all sorts of iPhones and MacBooks ... but what about when it comes to buying refurbished servers?  Our company is just engaged in such servers, so the answers to questions, myths and legends - all this is waiting for you under the cut. <br><br> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/pc-administrator/blog/263283/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4fa/9aa/ab3/4fa9aaab32a64a6c807ef45966d863f8.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  One of the trends of the crisis years is a noticeable increase in the share of self-assembly systems and servers of domestic brands in the server market.  One of the reasons is budget cuts.  In such conditions, consumers of any product, including servers, are forced to look for a cheaper alternative.  But there is another option - buying a server of a well-known brand, but a second-hand, that is, a used one.  If you put aside prejudices, in a number of cases this approach is very attractive and gives a number of advantages.  Especially, if we are talking about the so-called reconstructed equipment - tested, reconfigured and fully ordered servers, ready to serve for a considerable time. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#008bc4">Myths and Facts</font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9a0/e64/9d4/9a0e649d475d609ce98076b4b5c71337.png" align="left">  Just ‚Äúpoyuzanye‚Äù (used) and restored servers - as they say in Odessa, these are two big differences.  In the latter case, they are cleaned inside and out, removing dust and dirt, then the server is tested and stress tested, completed in accordance with the client's requirements, and the ‚Äúweak‚Äù (not reliable in terms of reliability) or damaged components are replaced.  It is characteristic that the warranty on such a server may even exceed the warranty period of the vendor for new equipment.

      In the west, the market for refurbished equipment, whether servers or iPhones, is extremely developed and only grows every year, which would be impossible with the low quality of the goods offered.  Nevertheless, many people refer to the restored equipment with a prejudice, so we will try to debunk some common myths to begin with and highlight the most important facts regarding the restored servers. <br><br>  <b>Myth 1. Recovered servers may be out of order.</b> <br>  As we already figured out above, this is not the case.  Such systems have undergone the process of upgrading and replacing faulty components with subsequent testing. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/10e/c13/248/10ec13248ec301b83afba6d3139c8028.png"></div><br>  <b>Myth 2. Restored servers are unreliable</b> <br>  Since the remanufactured equipment undergoes thorough individual testing and testing, in terms of reliability, it is not only not inferior to the new equipment, but may even surpass it.  So this statement is nothing more than a myth that does not correspond to reality. <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4e9/c98/aa0/4e9c98aa095c06022d59568de5fb33ab.png"></div><br>  <b>Myth 3. Lack of warranty, support and support</b> <br>  Quality refurbished equipment is always accompanied by a guarantee, and customers can get service and support. <br>  And now - a couple of important facts. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/90b/d66/052/90bd660525a25baff821b48950eb305b.png"></div><br>  <b>Fact 1:</b> Refurbished IT equipment looks as good as new, and functions the same.  It is tested, tested, cleaned and returned to a state similar to the new system. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/811/6ce/412/8116ce4122ac1a7903a843d23a7908ca.png"></div><br>  <b>Fact 2:</b> Updating the server park every 3-5 years is beneficial for manufacturers, but not for your business.  According to international experts, the purchase of refurbished IT equipment provides 50-70% savings compared to the acquisition of new systems.  And without loss of quality. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5b1/235/1ba/5b12351ba3a6ff240eae1c3569090976.png"></div><br><h2>  <font color="#008bc4">Our solutions</font> </h2><br>  As practice shows, in Russia you can get even greater benefits.  Our company, the <a href="http://www.pc-administrator.ru/">Network Administrator</a> , is the only company in Russia that sells the used used HP, Dell and IBM servers in accordance with Western standards.  We offer servers that have been restored to the state of new systems. <br><br>  At the same time servers: <br><ul><li>  Up to seven times cheaper than new ones; </li><li>  They come with a three-year warranty throughout Russia (the company has more than 100 representative offices in different cities); </li><li>  Provide a full cycle of support. </li></ul><br>  From pleasant bonuses - free delivery in Russia, and in case of customer‚Äôs refusal within 30 days from the moment of purchase we return the money.  That is, during this period of time, the server can be tested and a decision is made on future use, which is important when selecting servers for certain technical tasks. <br><br>  Each HP, Dell and IBM server that has been restored is up to four years old and runs all the necessary maintenance in our company, which includes cleaning, repairing and replacing components so that the server‚Äôs state and reliability are as close as possible to the new solutions.  Reliability is given special attention: engineers conduct a full diagnosis and testing of each server.  In order for the server to serve for a long time, every detail of the recovery process is thought out, starting from cleaning and ending with sealing in film. <br><br>  What does the guarantee from our company imply?  The warranty includes on-site service, with departure to the client (to the server location) during the working day from the moment of application.  Such a guarantee is valid throughout the territory of Russia, in Kazakhstan (Almaty) and in Belarus (Minsk) and became possible due to the fact that the company has offices in more than 100 cities of Russia, and the availability of analogues of previously sold equipment in a warehouse allows you to quickly replace any server or parts of it. <br><br>  The maximum period for repair or replacement of components is five days - according to the ‚Äúreaction speed‚Äù and qualification of specialists, such warranty service is comparable to the manufacturer‚Äôs warranty.  And the possibilities of bundling are even wider than those of the new server - apart from the standard options, it is done according to individual characteristics according to the wishes of the buyer. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/402/7cc/aae/4027ccaaed4d0ffbe83e873435531b9f.png"></div><br>  By the way, the ‚ÄúNetwork Administrator‚Äù is the first company in Russia that gives a three-year warranty on the restored servers with service at the server installation site.  The warranty covers all possible equipment damage.  Only hard drives are not covered, but they can be installed both new (with manufacturer's warranty) and used ones - in the second case, the customer takes responsibility for himself. <br><br>  It may turn out that the customer will prefer an even more economical option - not buying a server, but renting it in the selected data center.  This is also possible: ‚ÄúNetwork Administrator‚Äù cooperates with many data centers throughout Russia.  Those who still want to buy a server, but do not have available funds at the moment, can rent a server with the subsequent purchase in 12 months. <br><br>  In any case, the buyer receives not only a very good offer in terms of price, but also confidence in his choice.  In the current economic situation, the secondary market of server equipment is a very promising direction.  By purchasing a reconditioned server with a three-year warranty, you can optimize the budget, which will be an attractive solution not only for companies and organizations of small and medium businesses, but also for larger enterprises of various industries, where the previous generation servers can be used to develop and test software, to support various services (e-mail systems, work with files, printing, etc.), and, in principle, for any tasks that do not require top performance. <br><br>  In addition to the largest selection of server delivery options ...: <br><ol><li>  Sale by bank transfer with VAT (18%). </li><li>  Delivery with payment by credit card. </li><li>  Server rental with subsequent purchase (for 12 months). </li><li>  Server rental with a choice of data center to choose from with one of the lowest prices in Russia. </li><li>  Leasing of server equipment. </li></ol><br>  ... the company supplies new HP, IBM and Dell hardware with a 5-year warranty.  This includes a warranty from the manufacturer (from 1 to 3 years) and an additional guarantee from the ‚ÄúNetwork Administrator‚Äù up to 5 years, respectively - at the moment we are the <b>only</b> company in Russia with such an offer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/10e/f5b/9e5/10ef5b9e53c644b1aae8f45ebea66c85.jpg"><br><br>  <i>What is better - to buy a used Mercedes, or a new KIA?</i>  <i>When the budget is limited, you have to choose, and there are quite a few supporters of both approaches.</i>  <i>The same dilemma may arise when choosing a server.</i>  <i>But continuing the metaphor, the comparison will look even more interesting: a three-year-old perfectly serviced Mercedes with a three-year warranty (which includes replacing the car if it breaks for the same), or a new KIA with one year warranty, with the manufacturer‚Äôs service and without a car replacement guarantee.</i>  <i>There is something to think about, right?</i> <br><br>  Thank you for your attention, we are ready to answer your questions in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/263283/">https://habr.com/ru/post/263283/</a></p>
