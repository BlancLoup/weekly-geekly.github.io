Now the average cost of access to each Moscow apartment building is 500 rubles per month.  Moscow providers give about 2% of their revenue for the right to serve tenants. <br><br>  In Moscow, revenues from broadband access services (BBA) in 2014 amounted to 15.5 billion rubles, reports <a href="http://www.iksconsulting.ru/">iKS-Consulting</a> .  Then it turns out that last year providers paid the HOA about 300 million rubles.  According to him, the CEO of iKS-Consulting Maxim Savvatin, in the first half of 2015, the Moscow retail broadband market amounted to 8.1 billion rubles. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  For Akado, the average price of access to a house where there is a management company or a HOA is half the market average, but other operators, especially small ones, pay significantly more, <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2015/08/14/604913-dostup-internet-provaiderov-podorozhal">Akad</a> 's representative Denis Rychka <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2015/08/14/604913-dostup-internet-provaiderov-podorozhal">told</a> Vedomosti.

      2% of the revenue is close to the truth, although it is a very average estimate of the share of payments by the HOA providers and management companies.  For small operators trying to work with large management companies, this could be 10% of revenue, says Alkhas Mirzabekov, general director <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2598%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC">of Iskratelecom</a> .  From January to June 2015, prices for access to homes increased more than Akado believes: in the old housing stock - by about 20%, and in new buildings, by 100%.  The fee for access to the house, where just over 120 apartments, can be about 2500 rubles per month.  And often they try to force providers to pay for the repair of technical floors, communications in the house, etc., he complains. <br><br>  For some HOAs, mainly in new buildings, the growth of tariffs in the first half of 2015 amounted to 50-500% year-on-year.  The operator tries to negotiate with the managers, but often they have to refuse to work in various houses: it does not pay off, says the representative <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D1%258B%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB-%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BC%25D1%2583%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8">of VimpelCom,</a> Anna Aybasheva. <br><br>  The fee for access to homes is growing against the background that the average monthly bill of a broadband access subscriber in Moscow almost does not change: in the first half of 2015, it increased by 0.5% to 420 rubles.  It is not only the crisis that is to blame for the growth of appetites of management companies and HOA. The fee grows as competition among providers increases in the oversaturated Moscow market, that is, the more they try to keep their own and re-connect other people‚Äôs subscribers, says Denis Kuskov, general director of <a href="http://www.tdaily.ru/">Telecom Daily</a> . <br><br>  To solve the problem of non-discriminatory access to residential buildings, it is necessary to establish uniform tariffs for it for all operators, and this is possible only after changing the Law on Communications and the Housing Code, Rychka notes.  The problem can be solved by developing uniform transparent conditions for placing equipment in areas related to the common property of apartment buildings, says <a href="http://mgts.ru/">MGTS</a> representative Tatyana Martyanova. <br><br>  On August 11, Megamind <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/18416/">wrote</a> that the Moscow government favors the transfer of overhead lines of communication under the ground.  Now fixed and mobile services in Russia and Moscow are among the cheapest in the world and, in order to keep them like that, the tariff for sewage rental should be no higher than 1.5‚Äì2 rubles per meter per month, Mirzabekov said.  So far, these rates are higher at times. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293690/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293690/</a></p>
