Personal consultations of the RuNet guru can still be obtained at Startup Weekend (the closest one will take place on September 9, registration is <a href="http://startupweekend.timepad.ru/event/9270/">open</a> ). <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fb1/28f/59a/fb128f59a3c53adc01d6b19703ea7ada.gif" align="left">  The team of the project <a href="http://isvoe.ru/">‚ÄúOwn books‚Äù</a> is the very Petersburgers, about whose intelligence they make up odes and anecdotes.  The backbone is entirely graduates of the Faculty of Philology, who have worked in publishing for a long 14 years. <br>  Despite the old quenching of the authors, the project is quite in the spirit of the times.  <a href="http://isvoe.ru/">‚ÄúMy books‚Äù</a> is an open network publishing house (and a very real typography), with which you can turn any text electronic document into a paper book.  Starting circulation - 1 copy.  Texts - from your memoirs to the reprint of ‚ÄúDomostroi‚Äù.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/all-his/">+++</a> <a name="habracut"></a><habracut><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/172/8b8/45c/1728b845cffd80a087f0b0ba00ade2db.png" align="left"><br>  Vasily Dyachenko, the author of the Loyalty Factory project, kindly took it upon himself to tell about his project.  So say, in faces. <br>  ‚ÄúIvan is the owner of a beauty salon. <br>  Ivan tried to attract customers through collective shopping services, but finally he understood: in terms of business value, one regular customer is much more important than the fifty people who visited the salon once because of the 80% discount (refer to the principle of coupon services - approx. Wanted .VC) ".  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/loyalty-factory/">+++</a>

And first of all, this is a collapse at a purely technical level: the teacher does not want to understand how students are not able to distribute the list of references within the group, and students refuse to understand why the same list cannot be simply sent to them by e-mail. <br>  The transition to the new, as they say, ‚Äúinnovative‚Äù rails, is happening with a creak: the teaching staff for the most part cannot accustom themselves to the new coordinate system, the student bottoms do not want to accept authorities who cannot control the mouse and keyboard.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/technical-specialty/">+++</a> <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1a4/ad6/171/1a4ad61715282d8d228d3dbbeb219d7e.jpg" align="left"><br>  The description of <a href="http://profolio.ru/">the Profolio project</a> (also known as Profolio) sounds somehow in the style of slogans from Soviet posters.  Judge for yourself: ‚ÄúA platform for creating and maintaining a portfolio of work, focused on professionals engaged in the process of individual and collective creation of creative works‚Äù <br>  Professionals engaged in the process of collective and individual creation of creative works - we must think, artists, designers, composers and, scary to think, writers (and maybe, what the hell is not joking, and journalists?). <br>  And <a href="http://profolio.ru/">"Profolio"</a> , therefore, is nothing more than a tool designed to help them in every conceivable sense (after all, how else can we interpret the word "platform"?).  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/collective-conscious/">+++</a> <br><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b14/69d/8f5/b1469d8f52fa8b782b7ce80914ac0fff.png" align="left">  The <a href="http://rareschool.ru/">Rareschool</a> project <a href="http://rareschool.ru/">is</a> designed for those who are eager to join the cohort of extremely creative users of the Profolio service, which we <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/collective-conscious/">wrote about</a> yesterday. <br>  Most often, this desire rests on two problems: in order to become a director (editor, specialist in special effects, etc.), it takes time or money, and most often, both.  By and large, <a href="http://rareschool.ru/">Rareschool</a> also requires the first and second, but the process of obtaining knowledge is noticeably simplified.  In order to master the skills of working with video, it will be enough to go to the site of the service.  And then - look and listen.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/infrequently-asked-questions/">+++</a> <br><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dbe/133/472/dbe1334729148dabc25cd9bfc3d9315b.png" align="left"><br>  Social networks are not only valuable acquaintances, but also the opportunity to get something off the couch to sell something that you really want to sell in the shortest possible time.  Friends who know the price of your promises, much faster than abstract users of abstract online auctions, will figure out whether they need an iPhone you use at 70% of the initial cost, quickly figure out how to cross with you to pick up a purchase, and more quickly realize the phrase ‚Äúcash payment "(Or" change to the collected works of Jaspers "). <br>  Partly, the fact is that the status of a friend in a social network implies certain privileges - for example, a priori trust (even if you saw this ‚Äúfriend‚Äù once on someone's Birthday a year ago).  On the other hand, the point is in the social network interface itself: first of all, it is designed for communication. <br>  And what is trade, if not communication?  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/microeconomics/">+++</a> <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/962/151/659/96215165965b99ee0215b66db8a9b8c3.png" align="left"><br>  The author of yesterday's project Rare School Alexander Padalka - a man of ideas.  In the sense that the number of his ideas and the zealous attitude towards them evoke something between a jealousy and respect. <br>  As soon as we finished with RareSchool, the application for the CinemaStone project came to Wanted.VC - a system for managing film and television processes.  Unlike Rareschool, it is at the stage of writing a business plan and concept, however, what we already know about the project is quite enough to make at least a rough idea of ‚Äã‚Äãit.  The author himself helped us with this in detail describing the principle of the service.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/rules-for-removal/">+++</a> <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7bd/bdf/771/7bdbdf771d34b9d1e706bfdb3fc0e7c1.png">  TikTak is designed for people who want to meet, but - shy, that is, almost all people.  <a href="http://tiktak.ru/">TikTak</a> is an application for communication and dating companies, as a girlfriend, which you take with you on a date "for courage."  The main difference between TikTak and competitors is the principle of familiarity with groups, that is, among friends and buddies. <br>  Quite often, people are embarrassed to post personal profiles with real names on dating sites, they are afraid to take the first step to communicate with the person they like, and in the company or group, the person is in a comfortable environment that makes them more confident.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/tiktak/">+++</a> <br><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/19d/935/607/19d93560715dbfa75aa6bd7d6a814140.png" align="left">  The fact that the time spent on meetings on Facebook or "VKontakte" could be spent with more benefit, little more than half of the users of the service guess. <br>  The authors of the Black Cat service decided to take the path of least resistance and turn social networks to the benefit of the business.  The result of this idea was a project that allows you to increase the efficiency of the PR-department, HR-specialists and support department.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/useful-hand-of-bad-habits/">+++</a> <br><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d0a/855/3df/d0a8553df0fcf6f22ca3726232d31577.png" align="left">  It is clear that the windows in the house do not change every day.  Still, suppose that today is such a day: for example, the London riots miraculously spread to your area, and all your windows were broken.  You do not have insurance, and the state sent an amphora with a letter in which it clearly explained that it would not deal with changing your windows. <br>  Most likely, you, as it usually happens, will wave your hand and decide to act independently.  Open the browser and in a dearly beloved search engine, enter "plastic windows to buy."  Or "to buy double-glazed windows."  Or something else like that.  And then you will call one after another all those companies whose pages you liked the most, trying to find out what will be the replacement of the crippled portals.  And the most common phrase you will have to hear is ‚ÄúLeave your phone, we will count and call you back.‚Äù <br>  The creators of the project with the gentle name <a href="http://www.okna-tender.ru/">"WINDOW-Tender"</a> , their view of the problem.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/pop-ups/">+++</a> <br></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/127223/">https://habr.com/ru/post/127223/</a></p>
