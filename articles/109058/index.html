  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Practical advice for those who want to build a web community Part 2</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In view of the fact that my previous <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/108926/">post had</a> more positive reviews than negative ones, and also I received many letters with questions in PM (and even VKontakte, ICQ, and there were reviews on the autotourist), I decided to continue my scribbling about how I I did my project, with what I came across on the path of implementation and, in fact, to give advice. <br><br>  <b>Chapter 4. Where do we sow?</b>  <b>In the content!</b> <br><br>  Many asked how I gained the initial mass of users, after dialing which the community, in fact, somehow breathed.  It was like this: when I had just opened a project on one of the free <a href="http://livestreet.ru/">LiveStreet</a> 'ovsky (CMS of my project) design, the question immediately arose of attracting an audience to it.  But what will the audience come to, not to the naked place?

I started to wool various forums, LiveJournal communities in search of autotravel reports and write emails to their authors asking for permission to repost them from me.  80-90 percent of the authors were only ‚Äúfor‚Äù, because their task is and was (when they wrote reports) - to bring the experience of their trips to as many people as possible.  And it was only a plus for them that I posted their reports on my <a href="http://avtoturistu.ru/">Avtoturistu.Rf</a> .  Months went by, as I painstakingly, getting approval from the authors of reports on repost, sobsna, repost them in my home ... Now I have a huge collection of <b><a href="http://www.avtoturistu.ru/page/avtoputeshestviya_otchety/">reports on autotravels</a></b> on my website, and if you are an autotourist, then you‚Äôre in this ‚Äúparadise‚Äù bookmark my site. <br><br>  <u><i>Tip 4:</i></u> if your startup is a thematic community, then content will help to delay and increase its audience.  Allow and not unique, but aggregated, collected in one place, that is, on your resource. <br><br>  <b>Chapter 5. Where do the first 100 visitors come from?</b> <br><br>  This is perhaps one of the most popular questions of a person who technically ‚Äúmuddled up‚Äù the project, but sitting in front of him and scratching a turnip (here he has a smiley face, about official nizya to put in the body of the post) ... <br><br>  As it was in my case.  In principle, it all started with my report on that wonderful trip to Scandinavia, posted on my <a href="http://www.problematique.ru/%3Fp%3D16">personal blog</a> .  There was (by my standards) a large number of enthusiastic reviews on it, after which I decided to make a community where there would be not one writer and N commentators, but N writers and the same N commentators.  Well, after the start of <a href="http://www.avtoturistu.ru/">www.avtoturistu.ru</a> , I did a newsletter to my dear readers (blog), in which I informed them about the start of a thematic project.  Total: 30-40 people came from the blog. <br><br>  Beyond that, I made a <a href="http://vkontakte.ru/club9824026">group of VKontakte</a> , where I painstakingly invited people with the interests of "autotravel", "caravanning" and the like.  Accordingly, from the group invited them to the site.  And again, see Chapter 3 of the previous post.  Super mega-important! <br><br>  <u><i>Tip 5:</i></u> Do not catch up with all the bot scripts (whether in a group on VKontakte or in a community in LJ).  Treat your potential audience as the most valuable in your project, communicate with everyone if necessary, be honest and open with everyone, and your first 100 visitors who register on the site will, at a minimum, comment on the posts already existing in the community, and as a maximum - will become writers.  By the way, I have a reader / commentator / writer ratio of approximately 85/10/5 percent, respectively. <br><br>  <b>Chapter 6. Promotion</b> <br><br>  Of course, gaining an audience on the principle described in the previous chapter, of course, no one has canceled SEO, SAPE, AdWords, Ya.Direkt, etc. Yes, and, of course, PR !!! <br><br>  Here is <a href="http://turist.rbc.ru/article/16/09/2009/169001">an example</a> of a class cool PR autotourist.ru.  Here is another <a href="http://turist.rbc.ru/article/23/09/2009/169641">one</a> .  And here is a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/i_am_advertising/80477/">Habrow example</a> (even two minus ones collected; well, not -100).  Or here is the video below: <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/DnYmJm-5xr4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjp3xmZhODUg6vQZpcmsF3EZOK7Xg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Figures: in SAPA it took a month (now it is just a little less, for the natural reference mass is quite abundant) about 2000 rubles.  AdWords and Ya.Direkt I began to use relatively recently, the order of costs (example of the last month): 15,000 and 3,000 rubles, respectively.  Naturally, such investments become available to a single start-up only under the condition of a good advertising income.  What gives?  It gives a lot of targeted visitors, many of whom stay on the site for a long time, and someone replenishes the ‚Äúcore of the audience‚Äù.  My ability to make investments in promotion (monetary opportunity) is a job ‚Äúfor an uncle‚Äù (I wrote about that in that part).  Accordingly, I sent a certain part of the RFP to the site, but I could ‚Äúskip it‚Äù.  That is the answer to the question of "finding finance";  This is some kind of work, some other source of income from which you could ‚Äúpinch off‚Äù in favor of promoting your startup. <br><br>  <u><i>Tip 6:</i></u> With the ready project and the NN amount of money, do not be afraid to invest.  Many (and I used to) thought: ‚ÄúWell, this is the same (the result of investments) - a crane in the sky, and the money I have in my hands is a stable tit.‚Äù  Although, my two good friends who pushed me to the Internet in principle (first to the blog), which I mentioned in the first part of the post, always convinced me: ‚ÄúAnton, do not be afraid to invest!  You will be stubborn and persistent - you will certainly achieve goals and not what you return, but also increase the money invested. ‚Äù  They are right.  BUT!  No one guarantees that even being a pipets, how purposeful and stubborn the project will be to carry at least what mine carries me.  Therefore, of course, any investment is a risk.  This must be realized. <br><br>  I'm tired of writing.  If much, many rotten eggs are not cast aside, then I will continue (I will give both graphs and more numbers).  It‚Äôs just that I can‚Äôt make myself write differently than my brain tells me, that is, I‚Äôm doing a digital display and that's it!  Well, I‚Äôm writing here, as I would write (and I‚Äôm actually writing) a fiction book, and I can‚Äôt do it ‚Äúon assignment‚Äù under the tracing paper.  All the questions you are interested in, I will cover, but I ask you, you don‚Äôt need to: ‚Äújust give me one post, purely in numbers‚Äù.  I can not do that.  Thanks to those who are interested for their interest.  Encourages writing further ... <br><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/110250"><b>Part 3</b></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/109058/">https://habr.com/ru/post/109058/</a></p>
