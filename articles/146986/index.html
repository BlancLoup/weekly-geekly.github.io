  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tutoronline.ru: online tutorial call on the Internet. How it works?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We continue the story about how the <a href="http://www.tutoronline.ru/">Tutoronline.ru</a> team implemented a system of remote tutoring for Russian-speaking schoolchildren and students.  This time we will look at the very heart of the project: we will see how students' requests for sessions are processed in real time. <br><br>  Traditionally, online tutors in Russia work by appointment.  The student leaves his application on the website, indicates the subject, the desired time and the specific teacher (if there is a choice).  In this format, it is not always possible to count on the organization of classes on the same day, not to mention a more rapid response. <br><br>  We were not satisfied with this option, so we set ourselves a rather complicated goal: to provide an answer to the tutor's call within 1 minute (any day of the week from 10 to 22).  How did we organize it?

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7c6/896/882/7c689688256f39d5b3bf93adac49fd64.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The rapid response of a distance teacher to students' questions - this was the main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãour startup, it determined the format of the service.  Similar projects managed to gain popularity in the West, but in Russia there were no analogues.  We studied in detail the experience of the leaders of the online tutoring market for English-speaking Internet users - the sites tutor.com and tutorvista.com, which conducted more than 7‚Äì8 million training sessions. <br><br>  As a result, the following modules were implemented on the Tutoronline.ru website: <br><br>  <b>Database</b> in which each teacher is assigned a subject.  When a student sends a request for a session, notifications are sent only to profile tutors. <br><br>  <b>The authorization system</b> takes into account teachers who went to the page "My office".  So we evaluate our ability to respond to all incoming requests. <br><br>  <b>The notification system</b> notifies tutors of new applications (using a beep and a text message). <br><br>  Let's see how it works in practice.  A student enters the site who needs help in morphemic word parsing.  He chooses a subject (Russian), indicates his class, subject and then goes to the waiting page: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1e4/44c/91b/1e444c91b6b76262e32c98bf2108f711.jpg"><br><br>  At this moment, all teachers of the Russian language, who are authorized in "My office", receive a sound notification of a new question.  Here is what their page looks like: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f13/96d/d44/f1396dd4412327dbdea5371b287a0660.jpg"><br><br>  If any of the tutors are ready to answer this question, he presses the ‚ÄúAccept‚Äù button and both participants of the session (teacher and student) are transferred to the <b>‚ÄúWhiteboard‚Äù</b> module (we described it in detail in the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/tutoronline/blog/143284/">last post</a> ): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0ed/90c/ee4/0ed90cee4b69f2a5ed4c012eaf5ab005.jpg"><br><br>  But that is not all.  For each freelance teacher is assigned a full-time curator - an experienced teacher and subject manager.  He controls all sessions of his wards and each incoming request.  Our internal standard: the mandatory processing of each request during working hours.  If no freelance teacher takes a session (they have the right to do so), then the curator is obliged to work with the student. <br><br>  To solve managerial problems, we use a 1C CRM system.  It automatically records sessions, teacher and student evaluations, class time and other useful information: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/17e/b86/c41/17eb86c41a91956c3396c9debacbb815.jpg"><br><br>  Another important module on the site is <b>the teacher's schedule scheduler</b> (available on the My Office page).  We calculate the number of tutors on the subject for each hour of working time.  The teacher can mark in his schedule, on what days and at what time he is ready to conduct classes.  Now this feature is disabled because  We do not have many requests for instant response.  We will connect it as necessary and make it mandatory.  It will be beneficial for tutors to make their own schedule, because  we are ready to pay for waiting time (this is the practice of western companies). <br><br>  Another scheduled upgrade of the system is the addition of ratings.  Now the request of the student is available to all teachers - those who have time to answer first will do the same.  In the future, we want to offer sessions to the top priority tutors at the beginning, ranking them according to such parameters as experience, available time in the schedule, reviews and other factors. <br><br>  Do you have any ideas for new useful chips for <a href="http://www.tutoronline.ru/">Tutoronline.ru</a> ?  We are happy to study the questions and suggestions in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/146986/">https://habr.com/ru/post/146986/</a></p>
