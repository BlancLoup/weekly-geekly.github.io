  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Java resources to subscribe to</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  When the programming language is used by millions of people, it seems that there should be plenty of sites about it, including Russian-speaking ones.  However, if you type in the "Java News" search engine, the results are as follows: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a55/13e/208/a5513e208f2e4ccf87c81b99047ad37a.png"></div><br><br>  There are sites with the help of beginners in Runet (for example, <a href="http://javarush.ru/">JavaRush</a> ) - but everything with sad information for those who are already working and want to keep abreast of everything is much sadder.  It is clear that most experienced Java developers are quite capable of reading news in English, but still the native language is understood faster and easier.

      Therefore, first of all, we have now <a href="http://jug.ru/jug-ru-relaunch">restarted</a> the <b><a href="http://jug.ru/">JUG.ru</a></b> website to fix this.  And secondly, once the Russian-speaking regularly updated resources are in short supply, they remembered what English-speaking people are and share the results with Habr.  Of course, the text did not include everything that is possible, and we will only be happy to see additions in the comments. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  Sites </h3><br>  While everything is difficult in runet, there are several well-known Java-sites in English: <a href="http://javacodegeeks.com/">JavaCodeGeeks</a> , <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/">JavaWorld</a> , <a href="https://www.voxxed.com/">Voxxed</a> , <a href="http://jaxenter.com/">JAXenter</a> .  A close case is the development sites in general, which have a section on Java: <a href="http://www.infoq.com/java/">InfoQ</a> , <a href="http://java.dzone.com/">DZone</a> , <a href="http://sitepoint.com/java/">SitePoint</a> . <br><br>  SitePoint just recently restarted its Java section, calling the editor Nikolai Parlog (famous for his <a href="http://blog.codefx.org/">CodeFX</a> blog).  However, in September, there was only one material so far (detailed analysis of Java 9 innovations) - this is not the place where it makes sense to go all the time. <br><br>  But the dense daily flow from DZone and JavaCodeGeeks.  In addition to publishing their own materials, they also work as aggregators: by agreeing with a number of blogs about partnerships, they repost part of their entries (the site gets free content, the blogger gets more coverage).  As a result, sometimes you can see how the same blog post (for example, <a href="https://javax0.wordpress.com/2016/09/11/microbenchmarking-comes-to-java-9/">‚ÄúMicrobenchmarking comes to Java 9‚Äù</a> ) appears <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/microbenchmarking-comes-to-java-9">on that</a> and <a href="https://www.javacodegeeks.com/2016/09/microbenchmarking-comes-java-9.html">on another</a> site. <br><br>  Compared to non-programmer publications, English-language Java sites are very relaxed in their responsiveness to the presentation of information.  From the appearance of a blog post to its publication, sometimes it takes months.  The video of the report, long available to anyone on YouTube, may be published as "news."  It is clear that a good report for the month will not become obsolete - but many who wish by that time will have time to look at it, discuss it on Twitter and move on to something else. <br><br><h3>  Blogs </h3><br>  The difference between personal blogs and corporate ones is about the same as between a personal open source project and a large-scale enterprise: the first is more exciting, but very dependent on the enthusiasm of the creator. <br><br>  For example, Ruslan Cheremin in his <a href="http://dev.cheremin.info/">‚ÄúWorking Notes‚Äù</a> may publish several posts in a month - or maybe write nothing for a whole year.  It can deal with <a href="http://dev.cheremin.info/2016/02/tricky-scalar-replacement.html">scalarization</a> ‚Äî or, instead of code, can proceed to the <a href="http://dev.cheremin.info/2015/09/blog-post.html">calculation of probabilities</a> .  As a result, the content is valuable, but the source is unpredictable, and using it for everyday reading will not work.  Steven Chin, it seems, completely abandoned <a href="http://steveonjava.com/">Steve on Java</a> (but in the beginning of August he updated the <a href="http://nighthacking.com/">NightHacking</a> video <a href="http://nighthacking.com/">project</a> , making a number of entries on JCrete). <br><br>  Adam Bean is much more regular and restless: if you take both the <a href="http://www.adam-bien.com/roller/abien/">blog</a> and the video project <a href="http://airhacks.tv/">Airhacks</a> , its total activity is impressive.  <a href="http://www.yegor256.com/">Egor Bugayenko</a> is also distinguished by his regularity - he doesn‚Äôt have to wait long for his new record to cause another outburst of anger in some and delight in others. <br><br>  Other well-known personal blogs are Peter Vanie Lori's <a href="http://vanillajava.blogspot.ru/">Vanilla Java</a> , <a href="http://psy-lob-saw.blogspot.ru/">Psychosomatic, Lobotomy,</a> Nitsan Vacart's <a href="http://psy-lob-saw.blogspot.ru/">Saw</a> , the already mentioned <a href="http://blog.codefx.org/">CodeFX of</a> Nikolai Parlog.  Finally, another story - the <a href="http://shipilev.net/">site of Alexei Shipilev</a> , which is not something that would be a blog, but which, if desired, could be published a book. <br><br>  Meanwhile, corporate blogs, which are engaged in the quality of work, are becoming more prosaic, but more reliable.  There is usually no unique material behind which there are a lot of time spent and an enormous personal interest - but also sudden interruptions in broadcasting are less likely. <br><br>  Some of these blogs are entirely devoted to the company's products, but this does not mean "dull advertising": when video recordings of SpringOne Platform reports <a href="https://spring.io/blog">are published</a> on the Spring blog, for many it can be useful and informative. <br><br>  Other companies go further and publish content not only about themselves, but also about Java in general.  A striking example is ZeroTurnaround with their <a href="https://zeroturnaround.com/rebellabs/reports/">technical reports</a> (and since we started talking about them, it‚Äôs worth mentioning the <a href="http://virtualjug.com/">VirtualJUG</a> video sessions as <a href="http://virtualjug.com/">well</a> ).  At JetBrains, you can also find not only blog posts about IntelliJ IDEA (also useful), but also, for example, a <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2016/09/java-annotated-monthly-september-2016/">digest of Java news</a> . <br><br>  And OverOps (ex-Takipi), publishing materials like <a href="http://blog.takipi.com/junit-vs-testng-which-testing-framework-should-you-choose/">‚ÄúJUnit vs. TestNG‚Äù</a> , do something in between: they pick up such ‚Äúcommon‚Äù topics in which the mention of their product would be most beneficial. <br><br><h3>  Twitter </h3><br>  There are a lot of interesting Java activities on Twitter, and one could cite a long list of interesting accounts.  However, this has recently been done for us: TechBeacon‚Äôs recent list of <a href="http://techbeacon.com/java-leaders-you-should-follow-twitter">‚Äú39 Java experts you should follow on Twitter‚Äù is</a> quite accurate.  Also, a list of <a href="https://jaxlondon.com/top-20-social-influencers-in-java/">‚Äú20 socially influential javista‚Äù</a> has recently appeared, but its practical value is much more doubtful: of course, Joshua Bloch is a significant figure, but he tweets mainly about Donald Trump‚Äôs flaws. <br><br><h3>  Other </h3><br>  Of course, the ‚ÄúJava‚Äù hub on Habr√© is also useful, and here everything is in Russian - but you don‚Äôt need to tell about its content. <br><br>  Although this post is primarily about text content, at the same time I would like to mention the podcast <a href="http://razbor-poletov.com/">"Debriefing"</a> .  In the end, interesting text information is quite possible to find in its <a href="">Gitter-chatika</a> , if you have enough strength to wade through a lot of replicas. <br><br>  And finally, our site: <a href="http://jug.ru/"><b>JUG.ru,</b></a> now re- <a href="http://jug.ru/"><b>launched</b></a> .  It will now include Java-world news, expert opinions, and we also monitor most of the sources described in the text ‚Äî so if there is a sensational material on one of them, we‚Äôll let you know promptly.  And what else will be there - it depends on you: you can report wishes in the comments, and the entire feedback will be carefully considered. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/54e/84f/eb9/54e84feb9e854c67812bb77e9caafbbf.jpg"></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/310088/">https://habr.com/ru/post/310088/</a></p>
