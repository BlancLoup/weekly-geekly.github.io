The main positioning has not changed for several years: headsets for sports to enhance a sense of security.

      Despite the fact that the number of scenarios for using technology in ordinary ‚Äúnon-medical‚Äù life is about ten, the company has been and still is adamant.  Nevertheless, there were attempts to reach a new audience.  And who did not have them?  So there was a model Aftershokz Gamez - bone conduction for gamers. <br><br>  <b>The idea seemed logical</b> <br><br>  Theses with which the company turned to a new audience were very clear.  First, a long stay at the computer in closed headphones or droplets somehow affects the hearing, while the bone conduction of the sound is ‚Äúmore careful‚Äù from this point of view.  Given that the gamer enters the game for several hours, it makes sense to take care of health. <br><br>  Why not speakers?  Not in all particular cases it is convenient: if a person does not live alone, then loud music or loud communication can disturb others.  Some adult players have already got children and jobs, they can play only in the evenings, and in the evenings - children sleep ... and so on and so forth. <br><br>  The second advantage is open ears and the ability to hear ambient sounds and be aware of what is happening in the room.  In the West, this thesis was not so thoroughly explained: it was enough to say that you would not listen to fire alarms or robbers from the back door, and the thought began to play. <br><br>  <b>Not the first and not the last</b> <br><br>  Despite the fact that Gamez seemed to have disappeared from the assortment, the idea turned out to be quite tenacious enough, and other developers were also selected, for example, at KES2017 (‚ÄúKorean CES‚Äù) a design similar to the design was shown, but in the form of glasses. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e8/4a/59e84a991b662550449095.jpeg"><br><br>  Here, as it were, immediately after two hares: both the eyes and the ears in a dry face. <br><br>  <b>Why did not grow together?</b> <br><br>  The model attracted attention, and there were reviews, reviews, responses to it.  Moreover, everything seemed to be positive, if not to say with delight.  For example, in the Gamezone <a href="http://www.gamezone.com/reviews/aftershokz-gamez-wireless-bone-conduction-headphones-review-jy3g">review,</a> you can read that the sound is great, there are no ‚Äúblurring‚Äù, or, as we say, there is no distortion at the place of low frequencies, and during the game you can hear quiet steps and noises of virtual nature. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e8/5a/59e85abe207d8462040847.jpeg"><br><br>  A decent microphone with good noise filtering is also <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/scienceandtech/hardware-reviews/15296-AfterShokz-Gamez-Bluetooth-Headset-Review">noted</a> as a plus in the gaming headset, because sometimes you have to communicate online. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e8/5a/59e85aecb1624824592180.jpeg"><br><br>  There are standard <a href="http://www.legitreviews.com/aftershokz-gamez-bone-conducting-gaming-headphones-review_178265/3">wonders</a> about the feedback from low bass, but everything is clear: at high volume, the bass is really, let's say, felt, not heard.  But is it critical for gamers? <br><br>  Hear shots coming from around the corner of the enemy, the rustle of the bushes - do you need a deep bass for this?  - A rhetorical question, I guess. <br><br>  But if everything is so great ... <br><br>  Somewhere in Aftershokz really miscalculated.  First, not all computer models have built-in Bluetooth, and the headset has a wireless one.  Amazon realized this before everything else: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e8/4f/59e84f3759bd8947693147.png"><br><br>  Secondly, the company did not take into account a surge of interest in consoles, and as a result, did not offer owners of XBox and PS, many of whom complained, they could have allowed sound transmission over the wire.  Wired headphones are in the line, but they Sportz, not Gamez, go, in general, figure it out. <br><br>  And, finally, some in the comments indicated that, they say, yes: games from a smartphone are excellent results, mono-user sounds are super sound, communication is an amazing microphone quality, but here ... the delay is online.  It is a little more than some players would like because of Bluetooth. <br><br>  However, there are more defenders: gamers with hearing aids write in the comments on Amazon that they are satisfied.  High autonomy up to 7 hours of uninterrupted work + fast charging is also among the advantages of the Gamez model. <br><br>  <b><s>Was the boy</s> a new headset?</b> <br><br>  And this is precisely the trick: only the color has changed.  Model Gamez - this is without any technical changes <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/aftershokzbluez-2-bluetooth.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dbluez2s%26utm_campaign%3Dbluez2s">Aftershokz Bluez 2S</a> . <br><br>  Is it good or bad?  It is difficult to say, but the fact that neither the design nor the characteristics have changed, only the color has changed - this is a fact: Gamez came out in only one color scheme. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e8/53/59e853adcdf81738036809.jpeg"><br>  <i>Gamez - on the second photo</i> <br><br>  Formerly, the flagship model, which supplanted two controversial headsets: Bluez and Bluez 2, now also gradually leaves the market: the entire model line will soon be extremely flexible ‚Äútitanium‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>What is good about her?</b> <br><br>  In this version, important features have been reworked.  First, the sound absorption.  Indeed, before the headset with bone conduction at almost any volume, the sound was ‚Äúdistributed‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e8/5b/59e85bfcb45e8687655355.jpeg"><br><br>  Starting with the Bluez 2S, sound absorption is improved.  At a comfortable volume for the listener, the sound for outsiders becomes indistinguishable, and in some circumstances inaudible.  In particular, this was achieved due to a slightly modified form, which now provides a tighter fit and tighter contact with the head. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e8/5b/59e85bb4254f6238496825.jpeg"><br><br>  Two microphones provide a comfortable dialogue, even in conditions of increased noise.  The interviewee hears you clearly, raising your voice is not necessary.  At home, at the computer, the problem of natural noise is also not so acute. <br><br>  <b>How to buy Aftershokz Gamez?</b> <br><br>  We didn‚Äôt take this color to Russia, and now this color is not represented in a large assortment around the world.  Given that this is exactly Bluez 2S, you can consider this model as a headset. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e8/5c/59e85c180a440179157793.jpeg"><br><br>  <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/aftershokzbluez-2-bluetooth.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dbluez2s%26utm_campaign%3Dbluez2s">You can buy it here</a> . <br><br>  Headphones are in three colors: such as you saw in the photo, with a red headband and completely black. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/370919/">https://habr.com/ru/post/370919/</a></p>
