  <section class="page js-page"><h1>NetApp Converged Infrastructure Storage. Predictions 2016</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  According <a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13020926.htm">to surveys in</a> 2015, 40% of IT professionals from 451 respondents plan to increase spending on converged infrastructures.  This is a direct sign that in 2016 this trend will become more widespread. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c62/f3e/983/c62f3e9839c44cdeaf270597482c09ad.png"><br><br>  As with many technologies, the path of convergent infrastructures is due to the need for simplicity, speed and cost reduction solutions. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  DevOps will promote the growth of converged infrastructures </h4><br><br>  In addition to the need for simplicity and speed, convergence is one of the fastest growing segments in industrial infrastructures, as it solves the problem of most organizations: the lack of IT skills. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

      In this way, DevOps will promote communications, collaboration (colaboration), integration and automation to make organizations more efficient.  In 2016, organizations will see an increase in investment in converged infrastructures, and DevOps will be the key driver of this growth. <br><br>  While DevOps requires more time to develop applications, many processes are automated, including setting up equipment.  This reduces the time to develop applications.  Such a change in IT processes will allow IT teams to focus staff more on business objectives. <br><br>  Reducing the price will double the market for Flash technology.  The first wave of Flash technology came driven by the need for high performance.  Until now, Flash was used for caching and tiring, applying it pointwise for dedicated limited and expensive tasks, such as databases. <br><br>  But we are seeing a steady increase in interest in Flash over the past few years.  According to IDC research, the global market for Flash technologies grew to $ 11.3 billion in 2014. And during the second quarter of 2015 for the EMEA region, IDC recorded a slowdown in the growth of Flash repositories in its report. <br><br><h4>  New flash applications will open </h4><br>  In 2016, the IT industry will continue the beginning of the Flash revolution due to lower prices.  Sales of Flash technologies are ready to double due to a strong fall in prices of manufacturing companies that want to gain a foothold in the new market. <br><br>  With reduced prices, Enterprise level companies will soon begin to find new uses for Flash to improve their business.  Many companies use Flash for highly loaded transactional databases, which allows them to be distinguished by the speed of work and the constant availability of business. <br><br>  There is no doubt that hybrid clouds will change the vault administrators' horizon.  According to Sandler's hybrid cloud research, the market will grow by 29.22% during 2014-2019.  Thus, IT organizations must learn to support the modern choice of end users who are eager to create new, flexible and easily responding to new needs IT resources in the public cloud environment as a means to achieve this goal. <br><br>  In the key of the hybrid cloud approach, unified management of cloud resources, which will allow IT organizations to complement private clouds with strategies to use public resources that do not contain new risks, security policies and permits or loss of control over important business data.  Thus, it will affect storage administrators. <br><br>  The emergence of Hybrid Cloud Data managers as the new role of storage administrators will be the answer to the transformation of new horizons in IT.  Organizations will move to a cloud-based resource delivery model, to reduce costs and increase efficiency, thereby shifting from the model where they were integrators and operators of their infrastructure to their data center, to a model where they become service brokers that can be distributed on both private and public resources. <br><br>  in 2016, classic storage system administrators will either evolve into Data managers of the hybrid cloud as executives or continue more comfortable immersion in the details and storage system products, becoming less important. <br><br><h4>  Hybrid cloud evolution </h4><br><br>  The problems of data security and the indivisibility of the rights to them are shared by IT in their plans and strategies for using public cloud resources.  Administrators need to know where the data is actually in the cloud and who manages it all the time. <br><br>  DARZ-like companies have teamed up with NetApp to provide businesses with a data protection system that can be trusted, and the freedom and flexibility that safely unites colocation comes with a single cloud solution together with public clouds.  By providing a secure switch between cloud providers in seconds without a long data migration, it allows businesses to instantly benefit from the fact that time is running out of time and focusing more on IT on organization needs and innovations without loss of security and control. <br><br>  <i>Lee Caswell, VP Product, Solution &amp; Service Marketing on NetApp</i> <br><br>  <b>I ask to send messages on errors in the text to the <abbr title="Private message">LAN</abbr></b> . <br>  <b>Comments, additions and questions on the article on the contrary, please in the comments</b> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/279329/">https://habr.com/ru/post/279329/</a></p>
