We had occasion to act as Professionals ourselves, and somewhere as Lovers.  Each of us had a negative and positive experience. <br><br>  Discussed, like any other controversial topic in a stormy and long time.  As a result, a kind of tablet was born, roughly describing the reactions of professionals and amateurs to various situations. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><table><tbody><tr><th>  <i>Situation</i> </th><th>  Professional </th><th>  Amateur </th></tr><tr><td>  <i>if today it is raining / dark / winter / alien invasion / the firmament has opened</i> </td><td>  Will do what should, as it should, then, when should </td><td>  Everything's possible.  Perhaps he will survive and will not be able to work.  It is also likely that an inspiration attack will cover him and in one day he will complete all tasks for a week / month and rewrite the architecture of the project. </td></tr><tr><td>  <i>the final version of TK is approved by all</i> </td><td>  Go! <br>  Will do what should, as it should, then, when should </td><td>  n / a <br>  (the situation that the Lover has a project with a really final and approved TK is less likely than an alien invasion) <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <i>after 17 hours a brilliant idea came to the customer‚Äôs head</i> </td><td>  Turn off the computer and go home. <br>  Tomorrow morning, he will look at the idea and write a rationale why it‚Äôs impossible or how much it will cost if you can </td><td>  It will be midnight to swear with the customer, trying to either convince him not to do it, or discussing how to implement it. <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <i>in TK forgot Important Detail</i> </td><td>  He will say this when he reads the TK carefully and thoughtfully before starting work. <br>  If it has not been heard, it will do as it is written in the statement of work and additionally write a ‚Äúdissenting opinion‚Äù. </td><td>  Stumble upon this at the crucial moment on the night before the release. <br>  Calling the customer with the last words will make the most optimal (in his opinion at this particular moment) method. <br>  Will redo three more times at the request of the customer. <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <i>he was asked to draw an icon, create a logo, write texts</i> </td><td>  This is the task of the designer / content manager / PMA / Uncle Vasya - in short, not his. <br>  Being raped, take from the standard library. </td><td>  Curses the customer. <br>  Draw an icon. <br>  Spend two more nights on the search for the Ideal (in his opinion at this particular second of time) color combinations. <br>  Spit and take from the standard library. <br>  Refuse to work "in such conditions" <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <i>there are not enough people on the project</i> </td><td>  Will do what should, as he should, then, when he should.  No more and no less </td><td>  Curses everyone. <br>  Will work for testers / PMov / designers / storekeepers / Uncle Vasya </td></tr><tr><td>  <i>the working day is over</i> </td><td>  Turn off the computer and go home. </td><td>  And when did it start?  What does any of the framework of the day have to do with the flight of the spirit and true creativity? </td></tr><tr><td>  <i>the customer does not know what he wants and does not understand the topic</i> </td><td>  Will analyze what is. <br>  Understand what is needed. <br>  Propose an optimal standard solution. </td><td>  It will be for months to discuss with the customer what can be done with all this here. <br>  One night, he will understand and ring right in his pajamas to the other side of the planet and scream into the phone Elegant Decision. </td></tr><tr><td>  <i>the customer knows exactly what he wants, but does not understand the topic</i> </td><td>  Analyze the customer's desire and either agree or offer an alternative. </td><td>  He will propose a Brilliant Solution, which he has long wanted to implement (if it doesn‚Äôt fit the situation, he will pull). </td></tr><tr><td>  <i>the customer knows exactly what he wants and understands the topic</i> </td><td>  Analyze the customer's desire and begin to execute. </td><td>  And why then this customer came to the Lover? </td></tr><tr><td>  <i>the money is almost gone, but the project is not yet</i> </td><td>  Look what is left to be done and what can be waived without prejudice to critical functionality. </td><td>  No question, go ahead <br>  and you can also do this and this <br>  and here it is <br>  The main thing is not to end the inspiration. <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <i>the money ran out completely, but the project is not at all</i> </td><td>  Turn off the computer and go home. </td><td>  Sticking coffee hunger will work further </td></tr><tr><td>  <i>the project is over</i> </td><td>  Turn off the computer and go home. </td><td>  n / a <br>  (even if the Amateur, during one of the inspirational impulses, did everything that the Customer wanted, he will not be able to complete the project, because there is always a place for the Idea!) </td></tr></tbody></table>  Each of us had all sorts of examples: how the Professionals worked out when the situation reached a dead end and the Lover saved the situation;  how the Amateurs were established and the project had to be given to professionals for a lot of money, and vice versa.

      But there was something that we all thought: if you know what you want or are enough for you to work normally, if you are a Professional yourself, go to the Professionals, do not tempt fate. <br><br>  If you want your project to burn, to be offered something that you couldn‚Äôt even think of, if you need a sparring partner to understand what your project and your life are all about, don‚Äôt look for Professionals.  Look for lovers.  Look for those who will think in non-standard ways, because they do not like or simply do not know the standard ways.  But be ready to receive everything that is due for work with the Lovers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/348652/">https://habr.com/ru/post/348652/</a></p>
