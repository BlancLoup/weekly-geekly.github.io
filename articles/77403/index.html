  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Preparation of technical specifications (TZ) on the site using GOST</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I was interested at one time with technical documentation and I found such interesting standards on the open spaces of my native Internet.  Standards is not easy, but GOST.  Of course, they were not created specifically for the production of documentation for the sites, but they are quite enough to create a sufficiently serious technical task (hereinafter - TK) for a site of average complexity.  I think that with a skillful approach, you can use them in the preparation of any documentation relating to Internet technologies. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first thing I would like to draw attention to is the official standards.  The most relevant to our topic in this case will be: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://www.rugost.com/index.php%3Foption%3Dcom_content%26task%3Dview%26id%3D96%26Itemid%3D53">‚ÄúTECHNICAL TASK ON CREATING AN AUTOMATED SYSTEM‚Äù (GOST 34.602-89)</a> is a capacious piece of work with all possible types of software, which makes the document very spatial in relation to the creation of documentation for the sites, but serves as a good universal documentary basis for drawing up the TOR. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://www.rugost.com/index.php%3Foption%3Dcom_content%26task%3Dview%26id%3D54%26Itemid%3D50">"TECHNICAL TASK. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE CONTENT AND DECORATION" (GOST 19.201-78)</a> - more suitable for the design of TK to the site, In my opinion - a shorter version of the previous GOST and more convenient to use, because  practically, it is a ready-made set of sections of TK as a whole. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      It is convenient to use them in a pair, since  in the first (GOST 34.602-89) there are forms of the title and last sheet of the TK and how to formalize the document as a whole so that it has legal force, and in the second (GOST 19.201-78) the very principle of creating the TZ is described.  The points of the second GOST and their sequence quite allow us to use it as a plan for drawing up the TK. <br><br>  As a lyrical digression, I want to draw attention to one, regularly arising question - <b>who should provide the TK, the customer or performer?</b>  Many performers believe that it is impossible to work without TK from the customer, many customers refuse to write TZ, because ‚Äúthis is not our job, you need to write to you‚Äù.  In this case both sides are wrong.  In my opinion, the very design of the TZ should be done by the performer, but taking into account the wishes of the customer.  That is, the <b>work of drawing up the TZ should be joint!</b>  You can not cross it on each other.  Ideally, it is best to meet on a neutral territory and solve all controversial issues immediately over a cup of hot coffee.  This will save a lot of time, both for the customer and the performer, since  I do not have to find out what was meant by one or another point in the TK and would allow to immediately solve all disputed issues in a calm atmosphere.  <b>In the end, both win - the customer will be calm that the performer understood him correctly, and the performer, in turn, will be able to immediately exclude options when the customer wants the impossible.</b>  Immediately it will be possible to negotiate all deadlines and other nuances. <br>  If there is no possibility of a personal meeting, the customer can transfer in writing all his wishes to the performer - the performer and the customer already correct the dubious points and decide jointly controversial issues in the process of communication via Skype, ICQ, e-mail or phone and bring the document to its final form. which will suit both sides. <br><br>  And, of course, it is worth remembering that a document properly drawn up and signed by signatures is the key to the security of both parties who signed it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/77403/">https://habr.com/ru/post/77403/</a></p>
