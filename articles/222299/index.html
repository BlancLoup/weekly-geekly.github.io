  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The most popular trends of SEO-2014 according to Forbes</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/81d/9a5/cea/81d9a5cea5de40ee874398af8deda190.png" alt="image" align="right"><br>  The almost constant changes in the work of <a href="https://plus.google.com/107189857271631479870%3Frel%3Dauthor">Google</a> search algorithms lead to a rapid change in the leading trends in SEO.  Based on the past four months, Forbes journalist Jason Demers decided to summarize the main promotion methods that SEO specialists use in 2014.  In addition, in September 2013, the author submitted an article in which he tried to predict which trends would prevail in the 2014 SEO.  Leading positions have been given to content content;  creative approach to social networks;  image as a key content item;  short and informative advertising messages;  cross-platform;  targeted ads that use your browsing history.  What we see in May 2014: <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  1. The growing role of Google-authorship </h5><br>  Business owners are gradually becoming aware of the importance of Google-authorship.  Google has already <a href="http://searchengineland.com/yes-google-specifically-within-depth-articles-186627">confirmed</a> that they use the system of popularity of the authors. 
      <br>

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"

      <br>
      At the end of 2013, changes were made to the system, which weed out the author's content on low-quality websites, which led to the number of indexed authors reduced by 15%, but allowed a significant increase in the level of competition between recognized authors.  In addition, a multi-level system for displaying search results is introduced, depending on the ranking of the article and the resource on which it is located.  The higher the article, the more detailed information about it will give the search engine. <br>  It was also suggested that the content, the authorship of which is not specified by <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/1408986%3Fhl%3Dru">Google</a> , will not be ranked by a search engine.  Although the implementation of such a scenario will take considerable time, there is a serious motivation for authors to start associating themselves with their articles. <br><br><h5>  2. Social networks as one of the key ways to promote a brand online </h5><br>  According to the latest <a href="http://blog.shareaholic.com/social-media-traffic-trends-04-2014/">research</a> conducted by Shareaholic, Facebook continues to lead in the number of clicks to advertised sites.  In March 2014, almost a quarter of all traffic came from sites thanks to the Facebook advertising campaign.  Twitter continues to trail in the tail with a share of 1%. <br><br><h5>  3. "Content Management" is gradually replacing the term "SEO" </h5><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0d1/fc6/629/0d1fc6629d727b9c8139114549a3726b.png"></div><br><br>  Most experts agree that it is no longer enough just to have a promotion strategy.  In fact, the term ‚Äúcontent marketing‚Äù is beginning to be used synonymously with ‚ÄúSEO.‚Äù  Although these concepts need to be clearly separated, many are beginning to argue that content management is a new kind of SEO. <br><br>  Business owners and marketers should focus on creating high-quality content, not forgetting keywords and other SEO tools.  But everything goes to the fact that keywords are rapidly losing their leading position in the field of promotion.  However, any SEO strategy should combine high-quality content and fundamental principles that have not yet lost their relevance in 2014. <br><br><h5>  4. Reconsideration of guest blogging attitude </h5><br>  The word "Blog" was one of the most used keywords in 2013.  SEO professionals and internet marketers preached guest blogging as one of the most effective ways to increase traffic, increase credibility and other benefits for the site. <br><br>  Now we can talk about such concepts as "good blog" and "bad blog."  A ‚Äúbad‚Äù blog is focused solely on an increase in the number of transitions, a ‚Äúgood‚Äù blog is filled with excellent content and allows you to create your audience and earn a certain authority. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/140/b78/ba6/140b78ba6f68d2c979859471fa7e0688.gif"></div><br><h5>  5. SEO is becoming more expensive </h5><br>  Changing the algorithms of search engines leads to the fact that content management is becoming a full-fledged field of activity and requires the involvement of highly qualified personnel.  Gradually increasing demand for such a profession as a content manager.  According to one Kapost survey, 54% of marketers consider hiring a qualified content team as a priority for funding a marketing campaign.  This leads to a huge investment in SEO, which forces a thorough review of the approach to the content of resources and closely monitor the effectiveness of each change. <br><br><h5>  6. Seoshnikov begin to coordinate the work of the maintenance workers, and not ‚Äúlure‚Äù it </h5><br>  With an increase in the level of complexity of creating SEO-optimized content, SEO specialists are beginning to take part in its earliest stages.  They formulate TK, coordinate the execution, rather than optimizing the finished content, as it was before.  SEO professionals themselves become project managers who coordinate tasks, assign performers, evaluate performance, and perform other management functions. <br><br><h5>  7. Significant growth in demand for SEO services </h5><br>  The overwhelming majority of the company realized the need to use the services of professionals in the field of content management.  Today, competition for rankings in search services is fiercer than ever, which leads to an increase in the value and demand of specialists in the field of SEO and content management.  At the same time, the lion's share of demand is still accounted for by SEO specialists (78%). <br><br>  Today, it is still very early to say that it is not about death, even about the decline of SEO.  Tools and ways of promotion are changing to a large extent, there is a need for active integration with ideas of informative content, but SEO is confidently maintaining its position.  Constantly changing requirements that put forward search engines to sites require great flexibility from specialists and a high level of professionalism that will allow them to stay afloat, regardless of where the wind blows. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jaysondemers/2014/04/30/the-top-7-seo-trends-dominating-2014/">Original article</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/222299/">https://habr.com/ru/post/222299/</a></p>
