I happened to take part in the ‚ÄúAll-Ukrainian competition of youth on information technologies‚Äù, in the nomination ‚ÄúWeb-programming‚Äù, which this year was held in the city of Brovary, not far from Kiev.  What I saw there - frankly, I was shocked.  Read more - under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I came from there with spoiled nerves, with total displeasure, with surprise and in general ... I can't even find the words to convey with anything else. <br><br>  When I was driving, I thought all the same a state level competition.  The organization must be exemplary.  The jury, I thought, would be professionals.  I thought for a long time how to surprise them.  All the same - a state-level competition. <br><br>  As far as I was wrong ...

    <h3>  Organization </h3><br>  On the first day of arrival, 75 people (these are only participants) + their leaders from different areas all day in the morning were sitting in a small, like a box, assembly hall. <br><br>  All gradually went crazy until the evening.  The same can really go crazy - sit half a day in one position on the chair doing nothing.  Indoors it was commonplace to breathe, all the same so many people in a small assembly hall! <br><br>  Finally came the evening, what a happiness.  They have a schedule written: "Check in the hotel." <br><br>  If it were all so literally.  They took an old barely-traveling bus from the times of the USSR (where everyone barely got into) to the antediluvian hostels. <br><br>  They settled us on the 1st floor, we have 6 people in one box room, no comfort at all, so much dust that the nose was simply torn and it was difficult to breathe in general, the same dust was falling from the ceiling. <br><br>  We went to bed, all the same exhausted.  Aha - figushki :) Outside the window of the room, the cleaners watch TV, ride the mop, discuss the purchase of pans (not even thinking that someone might want to sleep). <br><br>  Of course, at the request of making the TV a little quieter, nothing happened. <br><br><h3>  Competition </h3><br>  Second day.  I wait half a day for homework defense in my nomination. <br><br>  It was written in the rules and regulations of the competition that the use of modern web site development technologies would be assessed, namely: AJAX, jQuery, Flash, PHP, MySQL, CSS, adherence to code standards and more. <br><br>  Aha, it is they, apparently, just copied from the provisions of the competition last year. <br><br>  The computers on which we have to protect our homework did not contain a single Web server, not a single modern browser (only IE, although later the participants installed at a minimum FireFox). <br><br>  The jury is a separate topic from which I was thrown right into the cold :) The jury is not competent in any of the above technologies.  They are not professionals in the field of websites, it is generally ... it will be good if they were teachers of computer science, but I even doubt it. <br><br>  The jury did not evaluate any of these points at all - because the jury is not competent in this field at all. <br><br>  At the request to open the source code of the site, the jury falls into a trance.  They do not know what to do, until one of the participants suggested that they open it in Notepad - they opened it in their ear.  But so what if they do not know what the source code is. <br><br>  In a word, I will not describe it all, but I think that you understood that here, in general, assessment was purely ‚Äúby eye‚Äù and that was all. <br><br>  The jury does not even know that in order to open the main page of the site you need to open the index file - and it‚Äôs not me who saw it, everyone saw it and smiled softly. <br><br>  In fact, works were evaluated on the basis of this principle: the jury member likes / dislikes - and this is because of their own qualities, since they have no idea about the relevance of the design today and in general, I doubt that they have extensive experience in surfing the Internet. <br><br><h3>  Works </h3><br>  What sites "rulili" for the jury?  Blue background, green text, brown color links.  This was just a bomb for the jury. <br><br>  And my W3C code using only tags and exclusively CSS, the design that is relevant for the day with easy navigation, none of the jury came to ‚Äútaste‚Äù. <br><br>  Separate story with web servers.  When a certain percentage of participants said that they needed to install a local server in order to demonstrate the site, a cool and deadly phrase from the main jury member sounded: <em>‚ÄúDid you bring this?</em>  <em>What are the Deans?</em>  <em>This sho take, I didn‚Äôt allow it !!! 1 ‚Äù</em> - I think, at least after that it became clear to you about the competence of the jury? <br><br>  I asked if it was possible to do some work from my laptop, the answer was simply awesome: <i>‚ÄúThe rules clearly indicate that you <strong>‚Äôll</strong> demonstrate from your <strong>UEsbE portals</strong></i> . <i>‚Äù</i>  Participants simply could not resist and throughout the contest the word ‚Äúuesbe-partal‚Äù became the most popular joke. <br><br>  To the question of one of the leaders to the organizers: What do you assess under the item ‚Äútechnical implementation?‚Äù <br><br>  We just turned the jury in a stupor.  5 minutes of reflection, the answer: <em>"Schaub was a lot of text</em> . <em>"</em> <br><br>  The guy from the team from Ternopil who was in the nomination "Programming" was no less shocked. <br><br>  A few hours before the competition, there was not a single programming environment on their computers, and when the participants compiled a list of software they needed, the ‚ÄúPetrosyan House‚Äù started again, the chairman of the jury read out and quote: <br><br>  <em>- Visual Basik, Se two pluses, Fre Pascal ... Visual Basik ??</em>  <em>And sho eta is?</em>  <em>No, I allow it.</em> <br><br>  The phrase ‚ÄúBehold Two Pluses‚Äù knocked us off the rail and we just lay on the floor. <br><br>  Actually, after such situations everything became clear to us both about the competition, and about the jury and about the ‚ÄúEuropean portals‚Äù as well. <br><br>  I think we should not continue, everything is already completely clear. <br><br>  I did not like the blatant lie of the chairman of the jury.  On the day of the homework presentation, the jury members were 2 + the chairman of the jury, and the next day we were told to do it again because a new jury member appeared o_O <br><br>  And not a violation of the rules, people?  When the defense has already passed, the scores are exposed and here the new jury member fell from the sky. <br><br>  I didn‚Äôt actually take my homework from that hostel that day, and is it my fault?  This is insanity. <br><br>  When we talked in a calm tone with them about this, the chairman of the jury began to tug at my hand, break, shout and raise the tone.  The man is simply inadequate.  Well, after this conversation, I decided to cancel the points for my homework. <br><br>  In short, I will not continue because there are just hundreds of such aspects.  The point is not that, just know how it was, make certain conclusions for yourself. <br><br>  <i>And finally, the most delicious:</i> first place given, of course, to the guys with templates, CMS like Joomla or DLE, and of sites on frames with a black background and unreadable text, well, or a blue background and green text - in this spirit. <br><br>  Thank you for attention. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/82673/">https://habr.com/ru/post/82673/</a></p>
