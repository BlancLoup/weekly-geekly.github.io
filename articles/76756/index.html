  <section class="page js-page"><h1>10 TOPs of the Runet blogosphere, who with what came to the closure of TOP Yandex</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> On November 3, 2009, Yandex, without knowing it (or maybe the other way around - knowing everything perfectly and chuckling quietly), organized an online contest with very unusual conditions. <br><br>  Everyone probably remembers how a shockwave of the information bomb swept across the Internet a month ago - Yandex closes the rating of the popular entries of the day.  Someone dug up another nail into the coffin of publicity and democracy, someone reproached Yandex with a trough before the authorities, and someone saw a dulu hidden in a pocket, because the rating of popular records had not gone away, but simply switched to "Semi-underground" position.  But there were also those who rolled up their sleeves and decided to try their luck - try yourself to make your best rating in runet. <br><br>  Because if you judge - all the attendant attributes of the competition are obvious. <br>  Officially announced the specific completion date of acceptance of competitive works - December 1.  A whole month was given to translate any creative ideas.  Anyone could take part in the competition, whether it was an organization or a private person, even the conditions for participation were published - the project that entered the competition must indicate the key phrase: ‚ÄúWhen compiling the ratings, the data obtained using Yandex.Logic search was used.  Yandex is not related to the method of compiling the ratings themselves "and put a <a href="http://blogs.yandex.ru/">link</a> to the site of the organizers of the competition.  Just like people.  All that was missing was fashionable in online PR campaigns to place a banner on his page and add Yandex to his friends, but who can say that Yandex is not his friend?

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In short, the competitive component is obvious, let's see how the applicants coped with the task.  In fact, it is clear that the main competition and the struggle for readers will begin only after December 1, when the Yandex rating will finally close, and each participant will remain one-on-one with an army of users suffering from something to chew their eyes on today. <br><br>  But it will be a completely different story.  Rating warfare will begin, administrative, corporate and financial resources will simply turn on, advertising spam, recriminations and searching for errors in the competitor‚Äôs code, <s>stealing</s> ideas, black PR and so on will be used ... Well, have you seen spiders in the bank?  And in business is always the case, what can we say about a young and troubled Internet business. <br><br>  However, today I want to take stock of a more or less honest stage, when everyone had a similar task and the same starting conditions.  To date, I know 10 participants - 10 projects submitted by December 1, operating in varying degrees (a month - a short time), services rating popular records of the Russian blogosphere.  I excluded ratings from the review that do not use data provided by Yandex.Search for blogs, such as, for example, TOP Zius or TOP LiveJournal. <br><br>  So, here is the composition of the participants who came to the finish, in alphabetical order: <br><br>  <a href="http://alltopnews.ru/">http://alltopnews.ru/</a> <br>  <a href="http://artlebedev.ru/tools/blogs/">http://artlebedev.ru/tools/blogs/</a> <br>  <a href="http://currentnews.ru/">http://currentnews.ru/</a> <br>  <a href="http://ljrate.ru/">http://ljrate.ru/</a> <br>  <a href="http://lleo.aha.ru/blog/yandextop">http://lleo.aha.ru/blog/yandextop</a> <br>  <a href="http://lopni.ru/">http://lopni.ru/</a> <br>  <a href="http://rublogs.info/">http://rublogs.info/</a> <br>  <a href="http://t30p.ru/">http://t30p.ru/</a> <br>  <a href="http://top-50.ru/">http://top-50.ru/</a> <br>  <a href="http://whoyougle.ru/blogs/">http://whoyougle.ru/blogs/</a> <br><br>  Let's see who was able to achieve what for the allotted month, and with what ideas got to the finish line.  Once again, we will consider only what the participants managed to <b>do</b> , and that each plan has a lot of unrealized ideas and a bunch - leave it to future potential users. <br><br>  1. <a href="http://alltopnews.ru/">http://alltopnews.ru/</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/806/1c2/1c7/8061c21c7c119a89cf05141604ca9489.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Features and advantages:</i> Breaking up the records into categories (Business / Art / Internet / ...), not a single competitor has this, the TOP archive for the past days, the ability to view all rating records, and not just the top 30-50 lines. <br>  <i>Disadvantages:</i> No previews of the first lines of posts, no previews of photos, no previews of user bloggers. <br>  <i>Technical implementation</i> 7 out of 10. <br>  <i>Design:</i> 6 out of 10. <br><br>  2. <a href="http://artlebedev.ru/tools/blogs/">http://artlebedev.ru/tools/blogs/</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9b2/e7c/310/9b2e7c310442fc434cfe74a977a0f40e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Features and advantages of the service:</i> One of the first working services, appeared just a couple of days after the announcement of the beginning of the competition.  There are userpic bloggers, preview records. <br>  <i>Disadvantages:</i> In addition to being one of the first TOPs launched, the service has no other merits.  Promises RSS, graphs, analytics, other ratings as appeared a month ago, and hang, remaining no more than promises. <br>  <i>Technical implementation</i> 6 out of 10. <br>  <i>Design:</i> 8 out of 10. <br><br>  3. <a href="http://currentnews.ru/">http://currentnews.ru/</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cf3/f8d/d0d/cf3f8dd0d476f9e1ba96b6a9b38aa637.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Features and advantages:</i> User statistics are present - blogger's previous hits in TOP, search by rating. <br>  <i>Disadvantages:</i> There are no user bloggers, and in general there is not a single picture on the entire service page.  Perhaps this is even a plus - the service loads quickly, good for slow connections.  The date of the ranking is not indicated, only the time.  And what is it the day before yesterday data? <br>  <i>Technical implementation</i> 7 out of 10. <br>  <i>Design:</i> 8 out of 10. <br><br>  4. <a href="http://ljrate.ru/">http://ljrate.ru/</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b58/705/6b6/b587056b6be1b5018b43b2b973199ea0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Features and advantages: The</i> best graphic implementation for today (in personal opinion, of course).  Convenient preview of pictures from the record, the original solution of round userpik, nice design. <br>  <i>Disadvantages:</i> If I understand correctly, this is a rating of records only from LiveJournal.  Also, the service does not have any original chips (except for round userpics), this is almost a complete copy of the existing Yandex TOP, and where are your ideas?  All went to the design? <br>  <i>Technical implementation</i> 8 of 10. <br>  <i>Design:</i> 10 out of 10. (compared to competitors) <br><br>  5. <a href="http://lleo.aha.ru/blog/yandextop">http://lleo.aha.ru/blog/yandextop</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c39/fc1/600/c39fc16004366abce42ab6f2ef4953f3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Features and advantages:</i> Very simple graphical implementation.  On the one hand, this is a virtue - nothing superfluous.  One feels that the rating was written for himself, and not to the general public.  Many sorting settings, almost everything that gives Yandex. <br>  <i>Disadvantages:</i> Very simple graphical implementation.  On the other hand, this is a drawback - there is nothing, neither a preview of the images from the recording, nor a userpic, nothing at all.  Visually does not separate posts from bloggers and LJ communities.  In general, everything is very, very simple.  Although again, for someone it is rather a virtue.  The page turns out easy, quickly loaded. <br>  <i>Technical implementation</i> 6 out of 10. <br>  <i>Design:</i> 6 out of 10. <br><br>  6. <a href="http://lopni.ru/">http://lopni.ru/</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/942/a91/0ef/942a910efc66aa0a82fc1b00c557275b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Features and advantages:</i> Dividing the rating into ‚ÄúHot discussions‚Äù and ‚ÄúMost important‚Äù (though it‚Äôs not quite clear what it is, it looks like it is just masked TOPs by links and comments).  There is a dynamic movement of records up and down. <br>  <i>Disadvantages:</i> Overly simple graphical implementation.  There are no previews of the first lines of posts, no images, there is not even a separation of blog servers, all posts are displayed under one standard user picture.  The complete absence of any settings. <br>  <i>Technical implementation</i> 5 out of 10. <br>  <i>Design:</i> 6 out of 10. <br><br>  7. <a href="http://rublogs.info/">http://rublogs.info/</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/578/e88/8da/578e888daf85234406f38cfcafa9b259.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Features and advantages: The</i> service is aimed at personalization of the rating, i.e.  on the compilation of personal top.  It is possible to exclude annoying bloggers from the personal rating, although, as opposed to this, there is also the possibility of obtaining a random sample.  There is a possibility to preview all the photos from the recording, and not just the first one.  Unusual concept of the last warning. <br>  <i>Disadvantages: Poor</i> design.  For such a hand would pootryvat! <br>  <i>Technical implementation</i> 8 of 10. <br>  <i>Design:</i> 4 out of 10. <br><br>  8. <a href="http://t30p.ru/">http://t30p.ru/</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/515/bbf/157/515bbf1570517035fa03fdf2c2b8291d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Features and advantages:</i> Implemented tag cloud (keywords), search by rating, there are previews of pictures and text entries, there is RSS and sending to email, in general a lot of things have been done. <br>  <i>Disadvantages:</i> It is difficult to even call.  Well, a little crooked design is it. <br>  <i>Technical implementation</i> 9 out of 10. <br>  <i>Design:</i> 7 out of 10. <br><br>  9. <a href="http://top-50.ru/">http://top-50.ru/</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8c2/e5a/e7a/8c2e5ae7ac9e7cd2b4059bf019efc18a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Features and benefits:</i> Cute design.  Convenient to leave reviews.  There is a breakdown of the rating on blog services, there is a convenient sorting. <br>  <i>Disadvantages:</i> Nothing new.  Others have it all and think about what to stand out? <br>  <i>Technical implementation</i> 7 out of 10. <br>  <i>Design:</i> 8 out of 10. <br><br>  10. <a href="http://whoyougle.ru/blogs/">http://whoyougle.ru/blogs/</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/df4/d86/239/df4d86239a9e59e797e1c47ea0015153.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Features and advantages: The</i> ability to most influence the ranking of records - the "equalizer" was first implemented on this service.  The same with the preview image from the record. <br>  <i>Disadvantages:</i> There are currently no user bloggers, the service is not a separate project, but is included in the whoyougle system, hence the constantly hanging banner ads and other extraneous links on the rating page. <br>  <i>Technical implementation</i> 8 of 10. <br>  <i>Design:</i> 8 out of 10. <br><br>  It remains to wish all the participants good luck and a fair fight in the future.  After all, in fact, only for TOP Yandex is the finish, for everyone else this is only the beginning of the journey. <br><br>  Rating flipping, wound on a mustache.  TOPs are good in different, choose to taste! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/76756/">https://habr.com/ru/post/76756/</a></p>
