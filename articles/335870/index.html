  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is DNSBL and how can you not get there</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  DNSBL are blacklists of domains and IP addresses.  Under the cut it is described what they represent, for what merits one can get there and what it is fraught with.  Well, and from there quickly, in which case, we also mentioned getting out with the help <a href="http://www.host-tracker.com/">of the HostTracker site monitoring service</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/fea/124/444/fea1244442b444528bbd9ec81cea58e6.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Even white and fluffy sites often end up in a very unpleasant company, namely in the same list next to spammers, fraudsters and beggars.  And in this case it is especially dangerous - for the owner is piously sure that his site is a store of wisdom and can be viewed without a shudder without even using an ad blocker.  So, he learns about the problem, if it does happen, very soon.  But it may happen. <br>  Example (random free proxy): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/8b9/47a/c51/8b947ac51b8b4d24ba1034045ade24b9.png">

          data-ad-layout="in-article"

        </script>
      <br>
      And if you click on any of these links, you can find the reason: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/772/d19/b69/772d19b69ade4645a9f0fde02a15e104.png"><br><br>  That is, this mail server has the wrong settings, or it has already been hacked.  If you click on other links, you can find other reasons: someone's spam is already going through it.  Why can different reasons be given?  What exactly do the DNSBL writers pay attention to? <br><br><h4>  How and why? </h4><br>  So, domain names AND / OR IP addresses fall into the DNSBL.  Virtual hosting tenants with a common pool of IP addresses have already tensed, is not it?  But the incomprehensibility of hosting to customers and the unlucky star, according to which your site at some point turned out to be at the same address as the Prince of Nigeria, are not the only causes of trouble.  Lists are compiled by the following criteria: <br><br>  <i>Suspicious mail server activity.</i>  What exactly is suspicion?  Everyone can create their own DNSBL list, having laid there, along with expert opinion and experience, all the shortcomings of their education and children's offenses.  It may be just the intensity of sending letters, or something more interesting - its distribution over time, the use of repeated mailing lists, etc.  <u>Quite a few mid-level hosters, offering their clients the services of an integrated mail server, have long been registered in such lists.</u>  Therefore, with a serious approach to business, it is not recommended to use these servers. <br><br>  <i>Mail servers with incorrect configuration.</i>  While the validity criteria may change over time.  This may be the absence of some, according to the compiler of the next DNSBL list, an important entry in the settings.  Or open ports.  Or the potential for OS vulnerabilities on this server. <br><br>  <i>Customer complaints.</i>  Yes, yes, if you clicked ‚Äúcomplain‚Äù, ‚Äúunsubscribe‚Äù and so on, and even forgot about it right away, it is quite possible that your efforts were not in vain.  Not to mention the angry letters to the host or site owner.  And the fact that they, as a rule, wanted to sneeze on it - it almost guarantees that the offender in two clicks will go to the dark side without unnecessary trials. <br><br>  <i>Proxy, especially allowing anonymous use.</i>  Here, too, each has its own criteria.  Someone just for anonymity can ban. <br><br><h4>  What are we afraid of </h4><br>  There are a lot of DNSBL lists.  But some, over the years, have gained a reputation and some weight.  The main criterion is practicality.  If the list really allows you to filter spam or other unwanted actions, various services start using it.  And the consequences can be very diverse - letters stop coming in or they automatically get into spam, warnings about fraud pop up to visitors, the site disappears from some directories where it was previously included and so on.  The result is usually one - the site falls in the issue and loses some clients.  And the more lists it appears - the more tangible these effects are.  If the jamb is serious, then the case takes a serious turn, but it is quickly noticed and corrected.  If not, the site can hang in a couple of lists for years and stably lose something.  What is worse in which case is a matter of taste.  So that <br><br><h4>  It‚Äôs better not to go there at all </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/8d9/382/1ec/8d93821ecc9b4708918dbf56b98cd36f.png"><br><br>  Well, or quickly get out of there if that.  Since the guarantee of missing you will not give anyone.  But you can regularly check these lists, as if saved God saves.  And, of course, you can do it automatically.  With that <a href="https://www.host-tracker.com/InstantCheck/Create%3Ftype%3DDNSBL">completely free</a> .  Well, for regular customers there is a separate function that will watch out for the bright name and address of the site on an ongoing basis and notify you of the trouble that has happened. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/712/03c/f16/71203cf16c944a8688f4a1071c0c513c.png"><br><br><h4>  Getting out of the pit </h4><br>  Having found the hit, the main thing is to respond quickly: the less time the site spends on the list, the less likelihood of problems.  No one has synchronized with this list yet.  As a rule, they allow you to delete an entry automatically.  Just go through the anti-botto captcha and politely click.  Here you just need to go to a specific page from the desired address: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/70c/70d/a55/70c70da55e374171a4aee05b6a000d03.png"><br><br>  In some cases, you need to write a letter.  But efforts in any case are not an example less than in liquidation of consequences.  So, in one way or another, we still recommend keeping a finger on the pulse.  And yes, generally speaking, hosting should do all this.  But ... :) <br><br>  HostTracker has developed this feature when it once got into the binding.  Therefore, we recommend learning from our mistakes.  Suggestions and comments, as always, will be welcome. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/335870/">https://habr.com/ru/post/335870/</a></p>
