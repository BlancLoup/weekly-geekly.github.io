  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Notebook for writer</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  - Everything, enough from us, we throw you in your human anthill and move to the mountains.  We will fall into nirvana, drink narzan and write a book. <br>  - Write a book?  When was the last time you held a pen or pencil in your hand? <br>  - To write books - it is not necessary to have a pen or pencil, you can print. <br>  - Given the lack of a source of electricity in your mountains - you have to get a good typewriter. <br>  - Do not have to!  As always, I took care of the problem beforehand and soon I will have a laptop that will solve all my problems! <br>  - Surprised and amazed!  It turns out that you can write a whole book a maximum of a day!  Until the laptop is discharged ... Or will your book consist of 3-4 pages? <br>  - My laptop will work almost forever, this is a special notebook for writers.  Now you will be the first person I will devote to some of the details of my mission. <br>  - Interesting interesting.  Let's start.  What is your product for? <br>  - Entirely for typing.  Opened the lid - began typing.  No to you desktops, beautiful and other things.  Only text mode, the display can only show letters.  The colors are also not important to me, so the display can be monochrome, like my old Montana watches, the main thing is that the energy consumes a little and the picture is visible in the sun. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  - intrigued.  And what is there OSes? <br>  - Perhaps it will be some kind of tricky build of Linux with all the buns, and maybe some of its own firmware.  Do not forget that the task of the device is to memorize the entered text and consume at the same time the very minimum of energy. <br>  - By the way about her.  And what kind of battery will work for six months? <br>  - It will work from finger-type batteries, it is easier to buy them, even in wild areas, but I will definitely take stock with me.  By the way, one of the ideas is solar panels on the back of the lid.  I hope the engineers will have the strength and taste of such an innovation. <br>  - And how will the files deal? <br>  - I think you can use anything, but I usually use * .tex format for books.  It is convenient to work with him, especially when you know what to write. <br>  - Normally, the user would not like this format. <br>  - If you already look at the mass user, you can always add a small instruction to the laptop with the basic rules for typing books in tex format.  It is still better than plain text format.  By the way, two flash drives will be used as a save location. <br>  - Why two?  System and user files? <br>  - Not really.  The contents of flash drives are absolutely identical, new data will be written to both at once.  One will be inside the laptop, so to speak, ‚Äúin the depths‚Äù, and the second will be easily retrieved so that you can pull out and transfer the data already in the publishing house. <br>  - Or quickly pull out and swallow, when a tribe of aborigines attacks you? <br>  - Ha ha ha!  Of course.  It‚Äôs better to take away the laptop than the data. <br>  - But what about bluetooth, everything gets better when there is bluetooth? <br>  - Of course, everything gets better when there is bluetooth, but I preferred the Wi-fi module.  I decided that let it be.  But on one condition: a large hardware switch to completely disable it should be above the keyboard and only show with its appearance whether Wi-fi is turned off or not.  Like the power button. <br>  - Wi-fi built in, but what about CD-RW? <br>  - It is not needed, like the touchpad.  After all, only text modes will be.  After much deliberation, I came to the conclusion that the sound adapter wouldn't hurt, but I didn‚Äôt embed the column - I would manage with a headphone jack.  Hardwired volume slider with the function of completely disconnecting the adapter will also be above the keyboard.  Installation of the port for the local network is left to the engineers. <br>  - It will not be easy for your engineers. <br>  ‚ÄúI agree, they will have to work hard on the hull.  It may be aluminum or carbon fiber, but in any case it must withstand falls from small heights on the stones, be water- and dust-proof.  The keyboard can be easily unfastened, and attach another.  This is because my wife and I have some minor disagreements about the location of some of the keys. <br>  - An interesting device in theory, it turns out, I think that the red-eyed console lovers, and writers in dense forests, it may come to taste. </div>
