For most entrepreneurs (especially regional) it is really expensive.  Of course, in advertising, ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù is a relative concept, but at the start it is a psychological barrier that the client will not step over. <br><br>  Psychologically normal amount for our businessman is 5 000 rubles.  This amount can be risked, not afraid to lose it, if something goes wrong;  because of 5,000 rubles you will not go to court, etc.  Anybody starts thinking like this when it‚Äôs difficult to compare the price with something similar.

      As we once learned to work in the lowest-budget segment of website development, now we are doing the same with advertising and promotion.  After a year of work, we can say that 5,000 rubles a month for website promotion turns out to be quite an adequate budget to make the client happy.  The main thing is to know how. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  How to make the client happy for 5 000 rubles per month? </h4><br>  To find out what makes a client happy, you need to understand his expectations.  It is very important to understand, and not to impose the criteria of happiness contract or commercial offer. <br><br>  If the head of a small company is asked how he evaluates the return on his site, then you will not get an answer.  He does not examine our Yandex.Metrica reports, does not count the number of applications from the site, and moreover does not evaluate ROI.  He just sees how things are with him in general. <br><br><ol><li>  <b>Appeals from the site.</b>  They should be for the client to feel that the site is working. </li><li>  <b>Site control.</b>  The feeling that someone is engaged in his site and keeps everything under control. </li></ol><br>  The above items are the result of our work to promote the site. <br><br>  Work on traffic, on positions, on requests - all this is not for small business.  Forget it.  It will make you happy, but not the customer.  Either we provide orders and calls, or not. <br><br><h5>  Appeals from the site.  To begin with - 10 applications per month </h5><br>  Of course, everything is relative.  But we are sure that for an average regional small businessman the number ‚Äúten‚Äù is already something.  Ten orders of pizza per month is not enough, ten applications for cargo transportation are not bad, ten orders of tractors are more than.  In any case, 10 applications through the site (through the site) - this is already something. <br><br>  For the starting point, we took the figure "ten", which we strive to at any cost.  As soon as the entrepreneur sees that the orders have gone, he begins to believe in the site, and faith (or confidence) is very much worth it.  ‚ÄúThere is fish here,‚Äù the brain begins to work, and then orders and budgets begin to grow. <br><br><h5>  Site control.  Promotion is also support. </h5><br>  Promotional specialists provide more customer support to the customer support department than customers themselves.  They know what needs to be done on the site, control the quality of the work done in support, and check all this in battle.  It turns out a closed system that regulates itself and suits the client. <br><br>  The client is interested in orders and contacts the promotion department.  The promotion service is interested in the result for the client and initiates the necessary work on the development of the site.  The support service does the work and gets paid.  The promotion department checks the quality and controls the effect of site improvements in the form of promotion dynamics and new orders.  It is very convenient for the client and profitable for the company. <br><br><h4>  How to make everyone happy at such a low cost? </h4><br>  Do you think we are applying new technologies?  Of course not.  Strict adherence to standards, regulations + a little automation allows you to work wonders. <br><br>  It has long been no secret methods of promotion.  Search engines increasingly prefer sites with good behavioral indicators.  If most of the site visitors come by targeted requests, looks more than one page, spends 5-10 minutes of their time on the site, then in the eyes of the search engine your site is useful and deserves to be higher than the rest who have less behavioral indicators.  Much has been written about all this, including <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/twins/blog/119686/">one</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/twins/blog/120505/">two</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/twins/blog/121861/">three by us</a> .  Let's go to the main thing. <br><br><h5>  Regulations and typical actions </h5><br>  There is not a single business, but there are proven success stories.  We do not invent stories of successful promotion, we write them down and repeat. <br>  During our work, managers have developed a schedule of standard works.  For six months, it is necessary to carry out all the work with quality, and then the result will not take long.  Here is a general reduced <a href="http://www.web-canape.ru/img/file/prodvizhenie_obschiy_reglament_dlya_menedzherov_webcanape.pdf">scope of work for managers</a> .  The specific set of actions may vary for different industries. <br><br>  Having your own CMS allows you to automate many routine operations for the primary targeted optimization of the site (mass installation of meta tags using unique templates, embedding micro-markup, quick registration of content in the form of selling pages, etc.). <br><br>  Further work to modify the site to improve positions in the search are divided into 5 months (from more important to less important).  This allows you to reduce the cost of promotion (monthly payments) and not to perform unnecessary work.  In a month, we allocate 3-4 hours of developers + work manager.  We almost do not use paid links in order not to fall under dependence on them. <br><br>  After 5 months, managers choose an advanced list of requests for promotion and look for options to increase targeted traffic to the site.  Everything else remains as before.  It is interesting that in Moscow such an approach gives good results. <br><br><h5>  Automation of project management </h5><br>  To control more than 30 projects for a manager is not an easy task.  All the time can go on just one switch between projects and phone calls.  To prevent this from happening, we have developed the Canape ADS tool (C-ADS), which is a combination of Yandex.Metrica, Direct and our Canape CRM. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/888/bc0/37f/888bc037f6ca710310c07d90db3abb48.png"><br><br>  For each client project, a subscription service is established in CRM, in which the tariff, promotion region, list of requests, goals, etc. are indicated. If the service is active, it enters C-ADS and the promotion specialists work with it.  C-ADS allows you to keep under control the implementation of client's tasks on time, pay for services by the client, track the achievement of goals, monitor important site statistics and plan work. <br><br>  The executive manager has a clear sequence of crawling client projects.  If the C-ADS system has a drop in attendance, the number of requests or calls from the site is less than permissible, the system will signal this and it will be a must to call the client and discuss the situation, without waiting for the client to call.  I think everyone knows how important it is to call first. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bfc/ed5/8ff/bfced58ff79b758004453f7756485db5.png"><br><br>  At the end of each month, reports are automatically generated (where to without them).  Project managers complement them with their analytics and plans for the next month.  The client is sent a link to the report, which he can view online or print. <br><br><h4>  Warranty, or what to promise the client? </h4><br>  We cannot give the client 100% guarantee of getting into the TOP or receiving the required number of applications.  We can promise an honest and professional approach to work and tell us what we are doing to increase the number of orders. <br><br>  A lawyer, a lawyer, too, can not give guarantees, if the court is fair.  You can only trust their professionalism and rely on a good job.  Or engage in <s>their own</s> promotion promotion. <br><br><h4>  Instead of conclusion </h4><br>  I was encouraged to write this post by thinking how to build work with a large number of clients and a recent review from one of our clients.  Feedback is on <a href="http://www.web-canape.ru/guestbook/">our website</a> (Luxlight Company Review).  He demonstrates exactly that client faith (or confidence), about which I spoke at the very beginning and which many start-up businesses lack to cross the line of unprofitability and start earning. <br><br>  The question of how to work with a large number of clients on promotion (from 300) is still open and, perhaps, soon we will be able to write about it.  We would appreciate your experience. <br><br>  Vasily Churanov and <a href="http://www.web-canape.ru/">WebCanape</a> team </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/223017/">https://habr.com/ru/post/223017/</a></p>
