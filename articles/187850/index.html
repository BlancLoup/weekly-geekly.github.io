  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The international network of provider independent data centers DataHouse</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fd1/299/08a/fd129908accd95d4b46fd6aa6d3e2bad.png" align="left">  The western market of data centers is increasingly absorbed by the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãgigantism: the number of projects announced all over the world that are huge in area of ‚Äã‚Äãdata centers is growing exponentially.  In Russia, of course, they are trying to meet the trend and are not building the largest but far from small sites.  The vast majority of them are located on the territory of the two capitals, and the regions are still most often represented in the industry by operator data centers at the level of local PBXs and small server rooms with split air-conditioning and UPS units modestly in the corner.  The key players in the regional market of data centers are still telecommunication operators, who lend to the business surplus of their space, and the situation on the regional market everywhere resembles the situation of the mid-2000s in Moscow.  Similar problems are observed in the CIS countries. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Does Russia need data centers in the regions, and what should they be? <br><br>  The Filanko Group of Companies with the DataHouse.ru project found its answer to this question by offering a unique solution that allows medium and small businesses that provide services in regional and local markets to place equipment in highly reliable, but small and inexpensive regional data centers. .  In 2006, as part of the DataHouse.ru project, the first data center was built in Moscow at Nizhnyaya Syromyatnicheskaya, whose areas were quickly filled.  In 2009, another capital data center was launched - at Burakova, and in 2010 - a data center in St. Petersburg.  The decision came to taste and the federal networks, as well as services with a territorial distribution of nodes, for example, gaming, news, media content, etc. According to Parallels estimates, in 2012 the size of the SMB market for cloud services in Russia was 15.6 billion rubles.  At the same time, the share of infrastructure hosting accounted for 5.8 billion rubles, web presence services - 3.4 billion rubles, hosting solutions for communications and collaboration (this includes paid e-mail and virtual PBX) - 0.6 billion rubles. , the share of business applications - 5.8 billion rubles.  Gradually, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating small high-reliability data centers was embodied in the project of the national network of independent data center providers DataHouse.ru, which in 2012 became international and is now experiencing an active growth phase. <br><br><ul><li>  Provider independence, allowing all customers to receive communication services from any operator present on the site, and if necessary, invite an operator to the site, with whom the client is most comfortable to work.  Technical specifications for fiber optic input, work on cross-connects, subscriber services, as well as the timing of response to requests for all operators are provided on equal terms. <br></li><li>  The relatively compact size of DataHouse.ru data centers (in the first stage - from 20 to 50 racks with the possibility of expanding up to 100) allows you to implement a program to ensure a personal approach when servicing each client, which is important for quickly solving customer needs of any level. <br></li><li>  The accumulated experience in the construction and operation of data centers combined with the use of industrial precision air conditioning systems, uninterruptible power supplies, diesel generator sets, monitoring engineering infrastructure and ensuring multi-level security in each of them allows us to offer customers high availability and physical security of the equipment placed. <br></li><li>  The presence in each of the data centers of the traffic exchange point Cloud-IX.net allows you to concentrate the maximum number of telecom operators at the regional and federal level on the site.  This became possible due to an active tariff policy, which allows to rapidly increase the number of peering participants.  In turn, customers who place equipment in DataHouse.ru data centers, when connected to a traffic exchange point, receive free local traffic and the ability to quickly organize any channels between all Cloud-IX.net nodes. <br></li><li>  The transparent tariff policy allows network clients to place equipment in any of the data centers at a tariff understandable to them, as well as to get the opportunity of free delivery of server equipment to any network data center in Russia or Ukraine. <br></li></ul>

      It is important to mention one more innovation, which so far applies only to data centers in Moscow, but in the future will be extended to all data centers of the network.  DataHouse.ru begins to provide rental services for server cabinets with the possibility of physically dividing the internal space into ¬Ω and  of the cabinet, with an individual key and ensuring that access to the placed equipment will be limited just as if the client rented a whole cabinet. <br><br>  Today, the DataHouse.ru data provider independent network includes five data centers in Russia, located in Moscow (two data centers), St. Petersburg, Yekaterinburg and Krasnoyarsk.  Another network data center operates in the capital of Ukraine, Kiev.  The issues of building sites in Vladimir, Nizhny Novgorod, Tyumen, and Novosibirsk are being worked out.  It is planned to actively enter other countries of the near abroad, in addition to Ukraine, expanding its presence not only with the introduction of technological platforms, but also with the main fiber-optic links. <br><br>  <a href="http://dcjournal.ru/">Journal TsODy.RF, issue 3</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.datahouse.ru/">www.datahouse.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/187850/">https://habr.com/ru/post/187850/</a></p>
