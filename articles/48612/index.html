It is about the tasks I would like to write, so: <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Task: google chatting with friends on Skype and Google Talk when there is no computer at hand. <br>  Solution: Put fring (http://www.fring.com/), configure it to work with Skype and google (just enter the current logins and passwords of the corresponding messengers), and then look for the nearest free WiFi (quite often there is in restaurants, on stations, airports), connect and talk as you need.  Fring supports not only Skype and GT, but also ICQ, and Yahoo Messenger, and MSN, and SIP, etc.  Details on their website. <br><br>  Task: sometimes you need to translate a word from a foreign language, but there is no computer with you <br>  Solution: set ABBYY Lingvo (http://www.lingvo.ru/) - this is the best dictionary for a computer and works on the phone.  Supports 8 languages ‚Äã‚Äãand knows some unimaginable number of words.  Depending on your needs, you can add or remove dictionaries, i.e.  if only English is interested, then you can leave it alone, thus saving space on a mobile flash drive.

      Task: it is convenient to read news from the small screen of the phone <br>  Solution: Put OperaMini (http://www.opera.com/mini/) and use the RSS-reader built into it.  Because  far from all sites have a version of the content, sharpened under the small screen of the phone, then the best way to submit information is RSS.  As a rule, RSS feeds consist of a news headline, a small picture and a brief description with a link to the full version of the article.  It is perfectly suitable for phone screens - news is different, you can quickly skip them, and if you are interested in something, then open the site and see the details.  Opera Mini does an excellent job of formatting the content of ordinary sites for a small resolution, so it‚Äôs best to use it, and not any separate RSS reader. <br><br>  Task: do not get stuck in traffic jams <br>  Solution: put Yandex traffic jams (http://mobile.yandex.ru/maps/probki2.xml).  The idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãYandex traffic jams is simple - when this application is launched, it simply transfers the current coordinates of the user to the Yandex traffic server.  The server determines which street you are on and if you move slowly, and there are a lot of people like you, this place is marked on the map as a traffic jam.  Those.  This application can be used without GPS, but it works practically from the bottom up.  If the phone has a GPS, then this application also has a free navigator with city maps and the ability to get directions. <br><br>  Task: to show your friends a funny YouTube video when you don‚Äôt have a computer. <br>  Solution: we put MobiTubia (http://www.mobitubia.com/dp/?q=node/2).  This is a mobile flv video player that can be searched on YouTube.  We put the application, connect to the nearest WiFi network (or via GPRS / 3G), enter the search phrase and watch the clip.  Due to the fact that the number of dots per inch at the screen of the smartphone is more than that of a computer, the video quality is simply awesome.  MobiTubia also allows you to save videos on the phone itself. <br><br>  Challenge: play with toys without interrupting osbo from the surrounding reality. <br>  Solution: there are a lot of games for phones, but basically everyone demands a quick press of the buttons for a minute without looking up from the phone screen.  I just do not like these, because  require constant attention, which is incompatible with mobility - in line, waiting for dishes in a cafe, in the subway / minibus to play them is simply impossible - all the attention on the phone screen, which can lead to disastrous consequences.  In addition, you can call at any time and have to start the game again.  I love the games in which you do not need a quick reaction + there is always the opportunity to start the game from the level where you left off.  My top looks like this: <br>  1. TowerWars: Time Guardians (http://www.in-fusio.com/start.php) - a strategy in which there is a road, monsters walk along it and you need to arrange towers in such a way to spend the least amount of money, while destroying all monsters.  Really addictive, because  money periodically is not enough, and the monsters with each wave more and more hardy.  The game itself is unhurried, thoughtful, gives you the opportunity to think, look around, then put the tower, then call, then read the SMS, and then return to the game and continue from the place where you left off - when you press the "home" key, and Also, when you call, or any other event of the phone that is not related to the game, it includes a pause. <br>  2. Fashionable dolls (http://modnye-kukly.ru) - I do not know how to properly describe this game.  It's like in films about "nondescript girlfriends" who dressed up become beautiful women.  Usually in such films there are scenes where ‚ÄúCinderellas‚Äù come to the clothing store and the ‚Äúcool specialist‚Äù evaluates how different clothes sit on them, periodically causing them to turn, walk, walk, walk, etc.  Here is the same - video of half-dressed models scurrying back and forth.  The developers claim that this is a ‚Äúmobile video magazine mod.‚Äù  I am not a special fan of any mods, I don‚Äôt understand anything about them, etc.  I just like the opportunity to drive a half-dressed model on the phone screen :) <br>  3. Tanchiki (http://tanchiki.ru/) is an analogue of the ‚ÄúBattle city‚Äù for the ancient prefix ‚ÄúDandy‚Äù.  Excellent strategy with elements of the arcade in which controlling your tank you need to destroy opponents.  The tank can be upgraded - buy weapons, armor, ammunition, etc.  Remarkable is that it has autosave, i.e.  it is not necessary to start again if someone suddenly called - just download the interrupted level.  The game of my generation, the generation who found the advertisement ‚ÄúDandy is played by everyone!‚Äù.  And they really did play!  :) <br>  4. Worms World Party (http://wwp.team17.com/).  We set the force by lined up, the angle of inclination and shoot from different guns across the hill, trying to take out the enemy's worms.  Up to four players are supported (as one against three computers, and all four are human).  Funny worms, various weapons - from a banal bazooka to a hilarious "old grandmother" that can get worse than any bomb :) At first, it‚Äôs annoying that all shots are fired almost at random - you can‚Äôt set the angle in degrees and force in any units.  The computer conducts a virtuoso aimed fire, and you have nothing to answer to this.  However, having practiced you understand that special precision is not needed - a person has something that a computer doesn‚Äôt have - a trick that allows winning even the strongest computer ai. <br><br>  Task: read a book from the phone. <br>  Solution: If you are a happy owner of a smartphone with a large screen and a good battery charge, then put QReader (http://www.qreader.com/) and enjoy, perhaps, the most useful feature of the phone.  The easiest way to describe this application is saying that QReader is HaaliReader under Symbian.  For those who do not know what the legendary HaaliReader is, I will limit myself to the main functions: <br>  1. Supported .txt and TCR, Palm DOC (.prc and .pdb), FB2 <br>  2. Support archived files (zip) <br>  3. Rotate the screen by 90 and 270%. <br>  4. 5 font sizes <br>  5. Directory support <br>  6. Search in the text <br>  7. Autoscroll text <br>  8. Auto-hyphenation <br>  9. Text formatting (align, margin) <br>  10. Quick view of hours and volume read <br>  11. Ability to change text color <br>  12. Quick transition inside the document (%) <br>  13. Sending text by E-Mail, Bluetooth, IrDA or MMS. <br>  14. Ability to turn on and off the backlight. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/48612/">https://habr.com/ru/post/48612/</a></p>
