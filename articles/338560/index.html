  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Who, how and why is going to regulate Big Data in Russia?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This morning I received another PR letter with the following sentence: <br><br><blockquote>  We are ready to provide a comment with analysis and forecast for the draft law on regulation of Big Data will be ready by the end of 2017. </blockquote><br>  The topic (‚Äúregulation of Big Data‚Äù) immediately interested me (I was at its origins), and I asked in response: ‚ÄúWhat kind of bill is speech?‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúThat's about it, <a href="https://ria.ru/technology/20170919/1505085765.html">ria.ru/technology/20170919/1505085765.html,</a> ‚Äù my counterparty promptly replied: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  Media Communications Union (ISS) by the end of 2017 will submit a bill, including regulating the use of "big" user data (Big Data), the head of Roskomnadzor Alexander Zharov told RIA Novosti </blockquote><br>  Further study of this issue in communication with several potential experts and the issue in public sources on the Internet made it possible to clarify the following.

      1. In addition to this publication, who does not know anything about such an initiative.  No one saw the bill or at least its draft.  So there is generally not very clear: how to comment on what is not. <br><br>  2. Apparently, someone has a desire to make the next law on the next IT regulation, but for now all this is likely to be in the nature of pre-sensing public opinion (the fishing rod is cast and the public response is monitored).  Actually, this is clearly seen from the RIA news - such authority as the head of Roskomnadzor also knows about the initiative only at the level of private private information, for which no one is responsible (this can be seen from his words "as far as I know"). <br><br>  3. At the same time, RIA news is hardly news.  The fact is that a similar idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating the ‚ÄúBig Data Law‚Äù was discussed <a href="http://www.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/02/06/2017/59313ea19a79474a5e288e0a">at the beginning of June of this year</a> , and even <a href="http://www.plusworld.ru/daily/cat-news_regulators/pravila-regulirovaniya-big-data-v-rossii-opredelyat-do-konca-2016-g/">in the autumn of last year</a> , moreover a year ago the same Mr. Zharov spoke about the issue, almost as already decided, saying then (as now) that the bill will be ready by the end of the year (but that time it was said about the end of 2016). <br><br>  In short, from all this, the sequence of news rumors only one thing is clear: the process of developing new requirements for state regulation of the information sphere continues, although it‚Äôs still a mystery about what the authors of the next initiatives are and why they are written into legal requirements. <br><br>  And here I want to return to the origin of the topic of ‚ÄúBig Data regulation‚Äù. <br><br>  The fact is that back in May 2015 (more than two years ago!), This issue was discussed in the Analytical Center under the Government of Russia in the format of a round table: <a href="https://www.itweek.ru/infrastructure/article/detail.php%3FID%3D175144">‚ÄúDo we need legislative regulation in the field of big data‚Äù</a> .  The general impression from that meeting was some kind of artificiality, artificiality of the topic itself.  After all, to solve a problem, you first need to formulate (or show) the problem itself, and here everything looked like that, someone really wants to solve something (in this case, ‚Äúadjust‚Äù), and it was necessary to invent the original problem. <br><br>  This question - ‚Äúwhat caused the agenda itself?‚Äù - was then asked to the organizers, to which they answered - ‚ÄúThe government asked us to study the question.‚Äù <br><br>  In general, then, the result of the discussion was the conclusion that Big Data legislation is not necessary.  That there are no problems to be solved with the help of such regulation: <br><br><blockquote>  One of the results of the meeting, recorded in its protocol, was a rather long list of proposals for how our state can use big data for the benefit of social development.  The problems of the actual big data from the point of view of the need for their regulation have not been identified. </blockquote><br>  Yes, of course, in two years (from that expert discussion) a lot could have happened.  ‚ÄúEverything flows, everything changes ...‚Äù It is quite possible that now problems have appeared. <br><br>  But it would be nice to know - what? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/338560/">https://habr.com/ru/post/338560/</a></p>
