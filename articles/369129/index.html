This is true, especially if you look at the prices of phones, applications for cameras which can immediately in RAW.  But my phone can not in RAW, and therefore you need to use gray matter and, a little, break the patterns :) <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Google found this topic very little information, almost no instructions.  And those that are, not only that they differ in the quality of the photo on the output, are also not universal.  The only thing that is a lot, is the discussion as it is all cool on the new flagships with android L and M. <br>  It seems that this topic is not specifically discussed.  Although it is quite strange.  For free, improve the dynamic range of your camera by pulling out a RAW file from it, it should be a running theme.  But, then, whether the people are not interested, or few people know that it is generally possible to do.  I do not know.  But I could.  And, sure, many will be able now, and most importantly, without buying a new phone. <br><br>  What you need for this: <br>  1. The bucket doesn‚Äôt matter which version (tested on fly phoenix 2 and THL 4000 (4.4.x)) with access to the engineering menu.  For information on how to access the engineering menu for your particular phone model or custom firmware, find out in the appropriate section on sites, for example w3bsit3-dns.com (not advertising).  There is an opinion that this can be done only on MTK processors, but I am sure that this process should also be available on other processors.  Need to test. <br>  There are some firmware (especially any ports from other phones), in which the engineering menu simply simply does not exist or it is presented in the form of several settings - in this case, you need to search for another firmware. <br>  2. Go to the engineering menu (EngineerMode), and this can be done in at least 3 ways (Mobileuncle or * # * # 3646633 # * # * or in the very settings of the custom firmware). <br>  3. Next, follow the Hardware Testing tab and find the Camera item. <br>  4. In the setting of the Capture type, you can set Pure Raw or Processed Raw, the main thing is not jpeg. <br>  5. In the Capture size setting, set the Capture size (you get the maximum photo resolution). <br>  6. ISO set optional.  (100 is the best quality). <br>  7. Click on the Start Preview button - the camera will open and you can already take a photo by clicking on the Capture visa button. <br>  Photos in the * .raw and * .jpeg files are saved in the DCIM / CameraEM folder on the internal or external memory (depending on the firmware and device). <br>  8. We need naturally * .raw.  This * .raw cannot be immediately imported into a lightroom or another graphical raw editor for processing, so you need to prepare it as follows (according to the <a href="http://4pda.ru/forum/index.php%3Fs%3D%26showtopic%3D635586%26view%3Dfindpost%26p%3D43813028">instructions</a> from frost_ua that I expanded): <br>  9. Dragging our * .raw into the Photoshop in the import dialog will need to correctly specify the height and width of the photo (we take the numbers from the name of the * .raw file or extract them in any other way, for example using XnView or IrfanView), as well as set the depth - 16 bit and write order - IBM PC. <br>  10. Get the black square of Malevich (not quite).  Select Filter - Other - Custom, in the dialog box, the value in the middle of the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãchanged to 64 and click OK.  We receive the B / W image. <br>  11. Then Save as and select the Photoshop RAW format. <br>  12. Now we need to use the raw2dng program (the first link is <a href="http://e2500.narod.ru/raw2dng.htm">from here</a> ).  But to feed her the file * .raw saved in Photoshop at once will not work.  To do this, you need to play with the raw2nef.ini file, namely, register your parameters here. <br><br>  Open the raw2nef.ini file and edit it for your phone: <br>  For example, we modify the first line <br>  15417648, 0, 3204, 2406, 6, 6408, 16, 4, LX1, -2;  Jiayu G2H <br>  for my phone, it will look like this: <br>  15360000, 0, 3200, 2400, 7, 6400, 16, 4, Phoenix2;  Fly Phoenix 2 <br><br>  15417648 - file size in bytes, <br>  0 - do not touch. <br>  3204, 2406 - photo size (the width and height values ‚Äã‚Äãthat were entered in Photoshop) <br>  6 - the parameter that will have to pick up manually.  Fortunately, it takes only 7 values.  I have this parameter = 7. That is how the colors in the photo turned out to be the most adequate. <br>  6408 is the width multiplied by 2. (3204 * 2 = 6408). <br>  16 - bits per pixel (10 or 12 or 16). <br>  4 - flag.  Reserve at 4. <br>  LX1 - change to the abbreviated name of your device (preferably without spaces) <br>  -2 - not required.  You can not write. <br>  Jiayu G2H - change to the full name of your device. <br><br>  Save raw2nef.ini. <br><br>  13. Reopen raw2dng_ru.exe.  In the window that appears, look for our device in the drop-down list (in my case, this is Phoenix2).  Close the program, and open it again.  try dragging our saved with photoshop * .raw into it. <br>  If the raw2nef.ini file is all correct, then next to the name of the imported file in the program will be the name of your device and some other info.  Feel free to click the ‚ÄúProcess‚Äù button and get in the same folder a ready-made * .dng file for importing and processing, for example in a light room (you can also choose to save to the * .nef file). <br><br>  And that's it, now we are ready to convert the files saved in Photoshop * .raw and feel the full power of our camera in batch mode. <br><br>  Ate the same in raw2nef.ini error - then on against the file name in the program will appear the word error with an explanation. <br>  After changing any parameter in the raw2nef.ini file, the program raw2dng_ru.exe needs to be closed and reopened. <br>  Thus, if the photo in * .raw after processing is obtained with strongly changed colors - we iterate over the value from the example [6] starting from 1 to 7, and see which of the seven photos will be the most adequate in color. <br><br>  Further in the lightroom, you need to do automatic white balance (color temperature and shade) and the colors will even out as it should.  In Photoshop, when importing a file, you can do the same.  Of course, if the photo did not work right away without any blue or yellowness there, then this item can be skipped. <br><br>  I want to note that, depending on the device and the firmware, some of the names of the items in the engineering menu may differ from those given by me in the article.  But, in general, I think everything is intuitive. <br><br>  PS: if someone came across this or can in programming on android, please explain in detail all the items in the camera's engineering menu.  In particular, there are many settings that are not quite clear how to set (such as EV Calibration, Custom Parameter, etc.).  Well, ideally, you can write an application that will take a photo straight into the RAW format without the need to enter the engineering menu.  (I can help with testing on 4-5 different devices). <br><br>  I thank the sites w3bsit3-dns.com and xda, as well as the user frost_ua. <br><br>  Thanks for attention!  Hope was helpful. <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> <br>  I post the <a href="https://cloud.mail.ru/public/Gu9w/dcT2SFQ5p">test</a> result.  The result I personally satisfied. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/369129/">https://habr.com/ru/post/369129/</a></p>
