  <section class="page js-page"><h1>With the unloved do not part</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Sometimes it happens that you have to make a decision about dismissing an employee.  I think many have done it.  It is difficult, I understand ... especially if you are the head of a small company or department where relationships are built as in a family.  But you still have to fire, because it can be otherwise. <br><br>  So how do you make this process not so painful?  Neither for you, nor for the dismissed, nor for the team: for you, you have to say that neither you nor the company need his services any more, and let him look for work somewhere else, but not here;  for him - at one moment those people with whom he not only handed over the projects, did not sleep at night and solved problems, but also had fun, drank, walked, told him that his work had become ineffective, that for various reasons he had fallen out of the process and company life;  for the team - for many, he became a friend, a friend, or just a nice person.  Of course, it also happens that the whole team ‚Äúrises‚Äù against one person and only dreams that he should be fired, but we don‚Äôt say anything about such situations - so everything is clear. <br><br>  So, the most important thing is not to dismiss a person with scandal, abuse, public censure, as a person may be offended, embittered and will definitely want to take revenge by doing minor dirty tricks, or simply begin to spread unflattering reviews about you or the company, which could harm the company's image or You personally, and you can start doing big dirty tricks (transfer important commercial information to competitors, run a bunch of viruses into the network, etc., etc.).

      It is necessary to part with people "amicably", while maintaining a positive personal relationship.  Yes, he may not suit you for various reasons, professional or personal, the main thing is to part with "on a good wave." <br><br>  Many will say: ‚ÄúWell, that took a good start in a good way and in a good way.  And how is this good? ‚ÄùAnd that's how it is! <br><br><ol><li>  If you intend to dismiss someone, be prepared for this: remember all the positive aspects of this person‚Äôs work, as well as the negative ones (you will not forget about them), once again analyze all this and decide for yourself whether you are doing the right thing.  Is the answer yes?  Follow on ... <br></li><li>  Think about where this person could be useful, where his efficiency will be higher (certainly not in your company).  It happens that a person develops his resource at a certain position, or he initially did not correctly define his field of activity, or does not have time to restructure himself in the wake of changes in the company's business processes, or he simply cannot work at that rate and with the return that the established situation.  This does not mean that a person is bad.  Accordingly, he needs help - to offer options where he could show himself better.  Think about your acquaintances, friends, good clients - maybe he will find his place among them. <br></li><li>  Never tell a person that you want to fire him, "sitting at the table", as a boss and subordinate.  It is better to create an informal atmosphere - for example, go to lunch together, and there, in a relaxed atmosphere, speak frankly with him as frankly as possible. <br></li><li>  During a conversation, in no case should you start a conversation about dismissal from the first minutes, better smoothly bring it to this topic, simultaneously explaining what made your decision, do not forget to note the positive aspects of this person‚Äôs work in the company. <br></li><li>  As an option, you can offer the person to continue working with you as a freelancer. <br></li><li>  After the dismissal, do not prohibit a person from coming to the office to visit his friends, friends, or corporate events ‚Äî let him continue to maintain good relations with both individual employees and the company in general. <br></li><li>  Tell him, he can turn to you for help, and you will surely help him if not by deed, then by advice for sure. <br></li></ol><br><br>  As a result, even by dismissing a person from the company, you will not get an offended person, an ‚Äúenemy‚Äù, and you will gain: <br><br><ul><li>  future competitor, loyal to the company and to you personally; <br></li><li>  potential customer; <br></li><li>  partner <br></li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4485/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4485/</a></p>
