      <i>The translation is not literal, but the meaning is accurate.</i> <br><br>  <b>Tencent</b> , the largest Chinese Internet portal, known above all for the Chinese popular <b>QQ</b> instant messenger, took and published data on the number of users of its Chinese social service <b>QZone</b> .  Last week, and leaked this info. <br>  The report itself is strange in Chinese, but the familiar Chinese boys from Web2Asia kindly transferred us to the good old American. <br><br>  And if we assume that the Chinese did not twist these numbers too much, then they simply demolish the tower on our side ... and even a little backwards ... <br><br>  Even if we allow some trick on the part of the Chinese, this statistic deserves that we publish it.  And we print it ... because we don‚Äôt know what else to do with it: <br><br>  - The report states that on January 31, 2009, <b>QZone</b> had <b>200 million users</b> !  This leaves such famous men as <b>Facebook</b> (which recently announced 175 million registered users) and <b>MySpace</b> (which hadn‚Äôt announced anything for a long time, probably mobile discharged) in a well-known place. <br><br>  For comparison, we looked into our favorite booklet from comScore - there they wrote us all sorts of data about all the Chinese and non-Chinese social networks.  But comScore only gives <b>QQ.com</b> visitors instead of <b>QZone</b> , which as luck would have it is a subdomain of this <b>QQ.com</b> .  In truth, we are not even very sure that the comparison is correct because it is not clear where the users of the QQ messenger site end and the users of the QZone social network begin. <br><br><img src="http://www.anti-site.ru/trash/chart-qzone.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Returning to the kitchen where the Tencent report was lying, we found that the Chinese went even further than we expected - they write that <b>150 million</b> of the 200 million <b>Qzone</b> users actively post on Chinese-language blogs, exchange Chinese photos and more everyone in Chinese is socially hanging out there. <br><br>  Further - more: <b>4 million</b> Chinese are uploading on servers an average of <b>60 million photos</b> and <b>9.5 million posts</b> to blogs per day.  Moreover, and this is just an edge, pitchfork and fly away - <b>QQ</b> said that on February 9, <b>50 million</b> Chinese were sitting in its messenger at the same time ... <br><br>  These figures so aroused us that we tried to dig deeper and dug out a report from some <a href="http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2009/02/24/is-chinas-qzone-bigger-than-facebook/"><b>DataCenterKnowledge</b></a> , which, like us, also does not catch up - after all, <b>QZone is</b> more than <b>Facebook</b> on the Hamburg account or the States have yet avoided such disgrace and still virgins. <br><br>  The article in <a href="http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2009/02/24/is-chinas-qzone-bigger-than-facebook/"><b>DataCenterKnowledge</b></a> , in turn, does not diplomatically refer to some <a href="http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2009/02/18/february_2009_web_server_survey.html"><b>Netcraft</b> 's</a> latest monthly report, which finally included <b>Qzone</b> blogs in its statistics this month and its mouth spontaneously opened: <b>20 million blogs</b> on the <b>QQ</b> domain. <br>  Here is what he writes, <a href="http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2009/02/18/february_2009_web_server_survey.html"><b>Netcraft is</b></a> this: ‚Äúthe inclusion of Chinese <b>Qzone</b> blogs in the results of this month immediately brought <b>Qzone</b> to the <b>first place</b> among blog services, they are really more than such blog dumps like <b>Windows Live Spaces, Blogger and MySpace</b> ‚Äù. <br>  True, on Facebook, their data is incorrectly low, for such is the specificity of their measurements, so the Chinese have not yet been able to measure blog services with Facebook. <br><br>  <b>QQ</b> also has social networks in other user segments, outside of their <b>QZone</b> service.  For example, <b>QQ Xiaoyou</b> unreadable rubbish is a social network for students and high school students (it looks like this is Chinese Odnoklassniki.cn).  This network raised its hospitable toko barriers in January 2009, and already there were <b>over 20 million</b> Chinese classmates crowded!  For a month, count up, yes! <br><br>  In general, we wanted to say something along the way ... Ah, so ‚Äî even if <b>QQ</b> is not the largest social network (well, we didn't follow hands when the Chinese were hanging out under the table), then there is no doubt that soon it will become the biggest one anyway ... no matter how cool the livestock of the Chinese is ... <br><br>  Link in Chinese: <a href="http://qzone.qq.com/">QZone</a> <br><br><img src="http://www.anti-site.ru/trash/qzone-screen.png" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/52828/">https://habr.com/ru/post/52828/</a></p>
