  <section class="page js-page"><h1>‚ÄúPlease, do not trample me on the site‚Äù</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Almost two years ago, when I hadn‚Äôt taught people how to make money on startups, to make quick photo models, Google wasn‚Äôt such a garbage yet, and web crowds didn‚Äôt win 2-0 from me, I created websites.  And one of the clients asked me to do something, from which everything would go nuts for his luxury furniture store.  At first I had a completely ordinary design, which they didn‚Äôt accept, but here‚Äôs the second idea that took all the head off.  During these two years, I saw only one site that was made using this technology, although <i>it lies on the surface</i> , and it was a company of the Sony level (who exactly - forgot.) <br><br><img src="http://rarestblog.com/i/pano_00.jpg"><br>  Remember, when in an article about a fast fashion model yesterday, I said that soon we will work <i>in the volumetric world</i> ?  Think i was joking?  Well, you got a traveler - come in, take off your shoes, I will tell you the story of how the Network ceased to be flat two years ago ... <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I really wanted the Web to break out of flat space and how could this be done better than with a luxury furniture store?  I designed its architecture (not in the IT sense, but in the sense of the building) - yes, the architect of me is not great, but not the point ... And I invited them to go inside and walk around.  No plug-ins, except Flash, using the technology of many years ago.

      Now I invite you, the traveler, to the world of fairy tales and an incredible prototype.  <b>Click the picture</b> , and then come back, if you do not guess it yourself, - read how it is done. <br><br> <a href="http://seelf.com/b/"><img src="http://rarestblog.com/i/pano_01.jpg"></a> <br>  Did you find a flying price tag on TV? <br>  Could you look at the store from the second point? <br><br>  Okay, so this was a prototype site.  The client was very impressed, as well as everyone whom I showed it in January '07.  Unfortunately, the client refused in favor of a simpler design, because this one is too difficult to update and decided to make another site later on this design.  But the technology went through a perpetual light bulb and got lost in the basements.  Enough time has passed and I decided to give it to the Public Domain, use it. <br><br>  So, the point is that you can use panoramas to simulate 3d space and it is VERY simple, as I will show below. <br><br>  At once I will make a reservation that this was the easiest way for the moment, something could change during this time and an even simpler one appeared. <br><br><h4>  What we need </h4><br>  1. Either the 3d model of the building where we will go (I made it in SketchUp, then threw in models of trees and furniture from Evermotion - it‚Äôs almost the furniture that they sell), <br><br>  Or we can use real panoramas of a real store or shopping center.  Panoramas 360x180.  <a href="http://stitcher.realviz.com/">Autodesk [RealViz] Stitcher</a> can recommend. <br><br>  2. Player for panoramas.  I considered many options, incl.  and all 3d frameworks, but loading a panorama into them is not easy.  Then I bought a player from <a href="http://flashpanoramas.com/player/">FlashPanoramas.com</a> (40 euros, our Russians do not have any relation to them, except that I bought the player).  Find a simple free alternative - write in the comments.  By the way, the site is in English, if anything - contact the author flashpanoramas@gmail.com, like his name is Denis Chumakov, in any case it is sent in the invoice for payment. <br><br><h4>  Part 1. Render and pitfalls. </h4><br><img src="http://rarestblog.com/i/pano_02.jpg"><br><br>  <b>IMPORTANT</b> .  This part implies that you can already model and work with 3d-max level programs or you have a modeler.  If not, you will have to wait for my other article where I will talk about <a href="http://sketchup.google.com/">Google Sketchup</a> and probably the <a href="http://blog.alternativaplatform.com/en/">Alternativa Platform</a> . <br><br>  So, I went through SketchUp ‚Üí 3DSMax + VRay ‚Üí speherical panoramic .jpg, but there are many options. <br><br>  1. We render either through the standard Max's render of panoramas, Google suggests that it is <i>Utilities panel&gt; Utilities rollout&gt; More button&gt; Utilities dialog&gt; Panorama Exporter</i> , or, if in <b>VRay</b> , we set <i>Sperical</i> for a physical camera. <br><br>  The output file should be ratio = 0.5, I did 3000 x 1500 and then the pixels are visible well.  Although, if I were not lazy and played with Vray a little longer (well, I‚Äôm not a modeler, and not a designer, I‚Äôm a programmer), it would have turned out better.  But we are discussing the idea here - I hope sincerely that you will do better. <br><br>  What is important - <b>make the ceiling and the floor MONOTONE</b> !  Look at the first point and the second in the site.  The difference between JPG 500kb, you know why?  In the one on the floor "type-carpet", in the other it is monotonous.  Remember that the output will be a giant file at least 3000 in width, which will have to be downloaded via the Web.  I understand that to you, comrades designers, the quality picture is more important, but think of users not in Moscow, who have your megovaya .JPG loaded for a minute.  They will not see all this beauty. <br><br>  So, <b>at the exit</b> we have a 3000 by 1500 file (or proportional) panoramic view ‚Äî it should look like the picture at the beginning of this section ‚Äî straight lines should become arcs ‚Äî a spherical projection. <br><br>  <b>UPDATE</b> Forgot, for semi-newbies: in order to shove so many trees - you need to use VRay Proxy, if you suddenly did not know.  Just make sure that the materials did not disappear, if you just make proxies from a group of objects, the materials disappear, so trees and concrete TVs :) to avoid this - you need to do something cleverly about a proxy - maybe a pro in the comments will tell - I will add. <br><br><h4>  Part 2. Panoramic player and examples for copy-paste. </h4><br><img src="http://rarestblog.com/i/pano_03.jpg"><br>  As I said, I used Flash Panorama Player.  Others can also be used, but Flash will have to be programmed here, while here is one view (the point where the user can get up - next I will call her <i>POV</i> = point-of-view) = ninety lines of XML, without Flash programming in general, and modeling the sphere and turning out its normals. <br><br>  I urge you to <b>support the author</b> who wrote such a wonderful plugin [no relation to him] - 40 euros - not so much, especially if you take $ 50K from a client for such a website :) <br>  I use the license.  So I tell for this player. <br><br>  1. Create an .html file for each POV. <br>  Take a sample at <a href="http://seelf.com/b/index.html.txt">seelf.com/b/index.html.txt</a> - there you only need to <b>change test.swf</b> in two places - what is the required <b>.swf</b> in the manual in the distribution you buy. <br><br>  2. For each <b>filename</b> .swf we create the exact same <b>filename</b> .xml - there all the magic happens. <br><br>  Samples taken at <a href="http://seelf.com/b/test.xml.txt">seelf.com/b/test.xml.txt</a> , <a href="http://seelf.com/b/test2.xml.txt">seelf.com/b/test2.xml.txt</a> .  I will analyze the first file - there is more interesting. <br><br>  So first, plug-in modules: <br><br><pre>  layer_2 = hotspots.swf </pre>  - all that is pressed <br><pre>  layer_3 = limits.swf </pre>  - restrictions on movement, if the panorama is less than 360x180 (I forgot why I connected it) <br><pre>  layer_5 = cylConverter.swf </pre>  - for spherical or cylindrical panoramas (the box is also able, but the plugin is no longer needed) <br><pre>  editor.swf </pre>  - a plugin for visual editing of panoramas, so as not to guess where to put a hotspot (this is hard to figure out), is in the purchased distribution.  From the site, of course, deleted. <br><br><pre>  panoType = cylinder </pre>  - spherical (or cylindrical panorama) <br><pre>  panoName = &lt;b&gt; test &lt;/ b&gt; </pre>  - what is the name of .jpg = <b>test</b> .jpg ‚Üí <a href="">seelf.com/b/test.jpg</a> <br><br>  Further in the hotspots section, we define the global section - these are all sorts of events (onStart) and functions (onOver, loadPreview, goUp, pt, etc.) - there is a very simple language, you will understand everything yourself. <br><br><pre>  &lt;box id = "logo" url = "logo.png" al .... </pre>  - the sample of the applied layer is my cap, telephones, all sorts. <br><pre>  &lt;box id = "up" url = "black_u.png" ... </pre>  - pattern of transition to a new point. <br><pre>  &lt;box id = "up1" url = "radking.png" ... </pre>  - a sample of how the price tag jumps on the TV behind you on the first POV. <br><br>  Since it is possible to impose even .swf words, there was an idea to even make an order basket ‚Äî just to transfer a purchase to it ‚Äî I didn‚Äôt think about it in detail, but it‚Äôs certainly possible. <br><br><pre>  &lt;cylconverter&gt; &lt;/ cylconverter&gt; </pre>  - Activation of the plugin for the spherical panorama. <br><br>  The player itself can still embed YouTube videos, audio, for example, into a panorama, you can also upload them without reloading the page and many more goodies.  Everything in the manual is. <br><br>  Then we upload it all to the site, show it to the stranded client and finish it with an account. <br><br>  By the way, there was another idea to add moving people (or rather, standing in place, projected gifs with micromovements - this is possible), but I‚Äôll introduce you to break your head like. <br><br>  Good luck, traveler :) <br><br><img src="http://habrahabr.ru/media/userpic/avatar/14/45/58/31055.png"><br>  Yoi Haji <br>  <a href="http://yoihj.habrahabr.ru/blog/">view from Habra</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/40103/">https://habr.com/ru/post/40103/</a></p>
