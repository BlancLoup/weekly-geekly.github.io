  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Web apps & Apple Safari</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  These are reflections on the topic: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/adobe/29765.html">‚ÄúOnline Photoshop will appear this year‚Äù</a> <br>  Future Adobe Photoshop will live in the Web, as you have such a prospect, eh?  And did you ever wonder which browser is the most correct, in terms of functionality and appearance, On-line Photoshop will work? <br><br>  All IT`nye companies today are trying to have time to stake out a place on the new Klondike that has opened - Web2.0.  Even HP has announced new <a href="http://www.ixbt.com/news/all/index.shtml%3F09/19/50">Print 2.0</a> services.  Ahead of all is of course Google, Yahoo, Adobe and Apple.  And Adobe and Apple are longtime allies and obviously On-line Photoshop cannot fail to make money with Apple Safari. <br>  With the release of Safari for Windows at WWDC`2007, Apple tried to break into the front rank of the On-line revolution.  This event can only be compared with WWDC`2005, when Apple switched to the generally accepted standard - IA (Intel Architecture).  Snot then flowed on all Mac-forums.  And this summer, Mac News was crammed with disappointments and incomprehensible fortune telling, and why does the Mac community need this Safari for Win product that you don‚Äôt have to screw to your native Mac, almost uncle Steve spends money on these untouchable Win Ducks.  And all because he is terrible - a new open world, with ample opportunities, terrible to get out of his shell and look at the world with open eyes. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And the computer world is already quietly and imperceptibly changing, and Uncle Steve is trying his best to be first!  Openly declare something new, dare to say the old - die, and again impose on your submissive herd, albeit with the pain of loss (the old wine is always tastier), but with the promise of a better (communism) future.  The new Safari 3.0 for Windows is the death of programming announcement using the classic OS-API. <br>  This is a renaissance of the old OpenStep for Windows project of NeXT Software.  This is an attempt to make a new shell of a classic OS, as when MS-Windows closed MS-DOS and all programmers gradually rewrote their old DOS Software under Win-API. <br>  And of course, this ‚ÄúLeninsky‚Äù reference to a new standard (although it did not sound in an imperative tone, but there was clearly a hint, and a year or two later it would be an order) - All modern programmers should learn how to write their own programs for Web 2.0 <br>  Build and Go There Comrades ‚Äì‚Äì&gt; to New Paradise ‚Äì-&gt; WEB 2.0 <br><br>  And when everyone realizes this and learns how to write <a href="http://www.apple.com/webapps/">full-fledged web-apps</a> , then it doesn't matter what your OS is on, any: MacOS, Win, Linux, Android will do. <br>  And it is important that your computer be connected via a wide channel to the Internet and you have the right browser on your computer - of course Apple Safari.  Because the most active support for web-apps in your browser today is implemented by Apple.  After losing the fight against OS, it seems that Apple wants to take advantage of Microsoft in the market for future web-apps.  To this end, Apple has actively connected to Web 2.0 programming along with its allies - Google, Adobe and Yahoo.  If they still did not compete with each other, and together the joint team were engaged in the development of web-apps, they could then have been able to overwhelm this slow-moving Mammoth - Microsoft.  Today, Apple is the only one of the four companies listed that has a competing Microsoft browser, and it tries to do everything so that Safari is the most correct browser for web-apps. <br>  And if the attempts of Google, Yahoo, Adobe and Apple to promote web-apps are realized, then happiness will come ...

      Good that awaits us: <br>  one).  Software web-apps will no longer need to be transferred from one platform to another (from Win to Mac); <br>  2).  Once written web-apps, whether it‚Äôs a Toy or a business program, you can run both on Mac and WinPC, and on Apple TV, and on iPhone or on any other handset or tablet like Android, just to the correct Browser (of course Apple Safari) was found, and only it was connected to I-net; <br>  3).  Specialized servers will appear on the Web, such as an Autodesk 3ds Max or Autodesk Maya server, which will calculate your incredible 3D models in near real-time. <br><br>  And these are side effects (such as insomnia): <br>  four).  You will pay a monthly subscription fee for using the Web-apps software or receive a bunch of ads; <br>  five).  Apple will open a web-apps rental shop on its website, where you can buy both Adobe Photoshop and QuarkXPress and CorelDRAW and other necessary Soft.  Well, Adobe and Quark and Corel and others redo their business models in the manner of film studios and record labels. <br>  6).  You must have a sufficiently powerful, or specialized (sharpened under Java) hardware to pull the interpretation of software written in the form of Java and other scripting languages. <br>  7).  You will receive a bunch of new I-net worms and viruses trying to know your personal data. <br>  eight).  For a wide I-net, Wi-Fi will most likely be used and you will always be tied to specific points, which means that the relevant authorities (state security) can always control you and find you anywhere in the planet Earth! <br>  Well, I think that's enough, and the rest will be prompted by your imagination ... <br><br>  If I understand everything correctly, after the knight‚Äôs move that makes Adobe, Apple‚Äôs next step is to release an updated ‚Äú.Mac‚Äù service that will include iWork or iLife products made in the form of web-apps, and then this service will be interesting not only Mac  ªovodov, but also representatives of other platforms, such as Linux! <br><br>  If Apple is going to seriously turn around to web-apps, then, of course, it will have to form a close alliance with either Google or Yahoo!  And then maybe Apple will finally make a big purchase.  For example, buy Yahoo!  and with Yahoo!  develop primarily Internet-business, but also iPod-Music &amp; Computers-businesses. <br>  In the worst-case scenarios for Apple, Google can still unite with Apple.  But since Apple simply does not have enough money to swallow Google, the main one in this alliance will be Google.  And then, most likely after some time, Apple will stop selling computer hardware, and the new combined company Google-Apple will focus exclusively on the Internet business ... <br><br>  Things to think about Web 2.0: <br>  1) ‚ÄúMicrosoft is dead‚Äù, Paul Graham ( <a href="http://offline.computerra.ru/2007/683/315608/">offline.computerra.ru/2007/683/315608</a> ) <br>  2) Tim O'Reilly "What is Web 2.0" (Russian translation <a href="http://www.computerra.ru/think/234100/">www.computerra.ru/think/234100</a> ); <br>  3) ‚ÄúWeb 2.0 Review‚Äù (http://designformasters.info/posts/web-20-overview); <br>  4) ‚ÄúModern style in web design‚Äù (http://designformasters.info/posts/current-style/); <br>  5) <a href="http://blog.turbomilk.ru/archives/000097.html">blog.turbomilk.ru/archives/000097.html</a> ; <br>  6) <a href="http://www.webdesignfromscratch.com/">www.webdesignfromscratch.com</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/16017/">https://habr.com/ru/post/16017/</a></p>
