    <h1>  How can a teacher make a million? </h1><br>  I will begin with a description of my quite obvious sources of income, as an IT teacher: the main place of work is the university, part-time school teacher, on weekends tutoring, sometimes freelance programming.  It turns out that this list can be expanded by sharing your educational resources for money.  This is a really good idea that everyone benefits from - buyers-buyers, and pedagogues-sellers.  In this article, I looked at ways to disseminate (preferably profitable for the author) educational resources without creating a <s>company for</s> your site. <br><br><h2>  In the world </h2><br>  <a href="http://www.teacherspayteachers.com/">TeachersPayTeachers</a> site helped to earn a million dollars to a kindergarten teacher from the above article.  For sales, the service takes a commission from the authors of the resources in 40% of the earned amount and an additional 30 cents for each transaction.  For an annual payment of $ 59.95, you can purchase a Premium subscription, which will lower the commission to 15% of sales and completely eliminate the transaction fee. <br><br>  An online market for teachers was created in April 2006 by a school teacher from New York named Paul Edelman (Paul Edelman), and for almost 10 years TpT has gained a base of 1.8 million resources and a community of 3.6 million teachers, which has already paid $ 175 million. <br><br><h2>  In runet </h2><br>  Today, there are several Russian-speaking online communities and one trading platform for teachers, as well as three official projects of the Ministry of Education and Science related to the distribution of educational resources: <br><ol><li>  Social network of educators ( <a href="http://nsportal.ru/">portal</a> ) - for teachers of all levels of education, files can be downloaded in all formats.  The teacher can create his own mini-site, place his developments on the mini-site and for 90 rubles receive an electronic certificate of publication in the electronic media and an electronic certificate of the creation of a personal website. </li><li>  Teachers Mutual Assistance Community ( <a href="http://pedsovet.su/">portal</a> ) - for kindergarten teachers and school teachers, files can be downloaded in ms office formats or as archives.  The teacher can publish his development and order an electronic certificate of publication for 200 rubles or get it in hard copy by mail for 250 rubles. </li><li>  Educational resources and lesson plans ( <a href="http://programmarazvitiya.ru/">trading floor</a> ) - for teachers of all levels of education, files can be downloaded in formats doc, ppt, xls, pdf, zip, rar, etc. Authors can publish their resources and assign prices to them.  For ensuring sales, the service takes a commission from the authors of 15% from the earned amount, but for 1500 rubles a year you can purchase a Premium subscription, which will lower the commission to 5% from sales.  This is the Russian equivalent of TeachersPayTeachers. </li><li>  A single collection of digital educational resources ( <a href="http://school-collection.edu.ru/">portal ECOR</a> ) - for school teachers, files can be downloaded in the formats of office documents, spreadsheets, presentations, there are interactive resources swf.  Teachers cannot publish their resources; the range of resource providers is limited to educational institutions and commercial organizations. </li><li>  Federal Center for Information and Educational Resources ( <a href="http://fcior.edu.ru/">FTSIOR portal</a> ) - for teachers of general and vocational education, files can be downloaded in a special OMS format, you cannot publish your resource, but this project is still interesting. </li><li>  A single window of access to educational resources ( <a href="http://window.edu.ru/">portal</a> ) - for students of general and vocational education, links to sites with educational information are collected and electronic textbooks can be downloaded in PDF format.  You can add your own resource, for which you must register. </li></ol><br>  There is no monetary compensation to the teacher for publishing the resource on the portals of the Ministry of Education. <br>  Social networks of teachers motivate authors by providing evidence of publication in the media. <br>  I will discuss in more detail some of the examples given. <br><br><h4>  1. Social network of educators </h4><br>  The social network of educators "Our Network" was founded in 2010.  Certificate of registration of electronic media received in December 2010.  Creating your personal mini-site on nsportal.ru is very simple.  Just register and the mini-site will be created automatically.  On the mini-site you can place your portfolio.  If you already have ready texts and photos, then it will take no more than an hour.  Based on the extensible functionality of groups (communities), you can create large educational projects, as well as websites of educational institutions, classes, groups, circles. <br><br><h4>  2. The community of mutual aid teachers </h4><br>  ‚ÄúEkaterina Pashkova's pedagogical community - PEDSOVET.SU‚Äù was founded in 2007 and registered as electronic media in 2010.  By submitting the material to the site, the author, free of charge, without requiring any author's remuneration, transfers the editors the right to use the materials for commercial or non-commercial purposes, in particular, the right to reproduce, publicly display, translate and rework the work, make it publicly available.  with the Civil Code.  (Art. 1270, etc.).  For the newly created sections of the portal there is a special offer of a free publication certificate as an incentive for the speedy filling of these sections. <br><br><h4>  3. Educational resources and lesson plans </h4><br>  Online market for teachers ProgrammaRazvitiya.ru is a place where you can earn money by selling your digital educational resources.  The site provides a separate link to the store of each teacher with his resources and publishes them also in the general catalog of resources.  You can post both free and paid resources.  The project appeared in RuNet after proving the success of this business model from TeachersPayTeachers.  The service is still young - the first author was registered at the beginning of 2016.  The teacher can add work programs of disciplines, lesson plans, development and presentation to the lessons and other educational resources, assigning them any price (if 0 rubles is indicated, the resource will be free of charge). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e5c/024/f98/e5c024f98ccf4e79bdf0d9b2d38ef9f1.png"><br><br>  Payments to teachers on the card of Sberbank for the sold educational resources are made on a monthly basis according to the details specified in the seller‚Äôs office.  The transfer of the money earned takes place under the condition that an amount of 500 rubles is accumulated, and if the amount has not reached this threshold in the current month, then this condition will be checked next month. <br><br><h4>  4. One collection of digital educational resources. </h4><br>  The collection cannot be called rich, because the motivation to publish new resources for teachers is not traceable at all, you cannot even add your resource through the site.  Resource authors are organizations that are listed in <a href="http://school-collection.edu.ru/providers/">the resource provider list</a> . <br>  As a teacher, ICT used some resources (there are few of them) and I can mention the plus of this portal: the materials correspond to the official adopted programs in Russia. <br><br>  The interface and the quality of the technical implementation of the portal are at a height, yet the organizer is the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation.  There is also a minus - sometimes the portal is unavailable. <br><br><h4>  5. Federal Center for Information and Educational Resources </h4><br>  FTSIOR provides resources in the OMI format from only a certain circle of <a href="http://fcior.edu.ru/postavshchiki-resursov">10 suppliers</a> (2 state universities and 8 commercial enterprises).  Any wishing teacher is not able to independently publish their resources. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Open Educational Modular Multimedia Systems (OMS)</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Open educational modular multimedia systems (OMS) are an electronic educational resource of modular architecture.  To work with the OMS electronic training modules, you need to download from the portal and install special software on your local computer - the resource player. <br><br>  Software for viewing resources provides storage, search, selection and playback of Electronic Learning Modules (EUM): <br><ul><li>  OMC Player - designed to play EUM.  The player provides the ability to search EUM among the modules located in the local storage.  Local storage is a dedicated folder on the user's computer, the path to which is set when installing the OMC software components. </li><li>  OMS User Organizer - provides loading of EEM from the central storage of the FCEAR to the user's local storage, as well as storage of selected modules in the user's workplace.  The organizer allows you to play and view the EMP metadata stored in the local storage. </li></ul><br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">FTSIOR technology platform</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The hardware complex FTSIOR is built on IBM solutions and technologies. <br><br>  Computing facilities center provide high-performance IBM servers.  Efficient storage of various types of electronic educational resources is carried out using Open Source projects.  The software architecture of FCEIOR is implemented on JavaServlets, Java Server Pages technologies using projects of the Apache Software Foundation (Tomcat, Lucene, Commons).  MySQL is used as a DBMS for application systems.  Application Development - Java 2, Enterprise Edition Platform. <br></div></div><br><br><h4>  6. One-stop access to educational resources </h4><br>  You can offer to add the ‚ÄúSingle Window‚Äù information system with new resources - place the material in the electronic library or a link to an Internet resource in the catalog. <br><br>  The sent document can be placed in the electronic library if you are its author (co-author) or offer it with the knowledge and consent of the authors and your actions do not contradict the ‚ÄúCivil Code of the Russian Federation (PART FOUR)‚Äù of December 18, 2006 N 230-. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/10a/7c0/72c/10a7c072cffd4c1c8f9de7670693cd6a.png"><br><br>  The electronic library does not contain materials representing work programs of disciplines, lesson plans, development and presentation of lessons, etc. <br><br>  The catalog may include a link to any resource of a scientific and educational nature that is publicly available on the Internet. <br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  There are enough opportunities for teachers to spread digital educational resources in runet, but the material motivation of authors to publish their unique developments is still poorly developed.  It‚Äôs profitable to sell your digital educational establishments, this is shown by the 10-year-old age and the experience of the foreign digital educational resources market.  Until 2016, in RuNet, it was only possible to donate your copyright materials to the world free of charge on state or private portals (the latter offer a paid service to provide a certificate of publication).  Recently, an alternative has appeared - to make money on its own resources, but it is too early to speak about the effectiveness of this.  In my opinion, this is a very effective motivation to publish more new high-quality materials, when the teacher can earn in addition to his salary. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298972/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298972/</a></p>
