It is not enough to understand that a particular unit is not working correctly; it is important to understand how it interacts with others.  Otherwise, it is impossible to identify all the existing problems and choose the optimal method for solving the problem.  And for this you need to study the work of the company and make its functional model. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Of course, in theory, the functional model of the company‚Äôs work should be with the manager, and it doesn‚Äôt matter whether it is about organizing the warehouse or about the IT system from lead to application.  But in reality, it almost never turns out, and therefore in the process of studying and finding a solution to the task set by the client, I also create a functional model of the company or a specific process (function) independently. <br><br><h3>  A few words about the benefits of graphics </h3><br>  As you know, IDEF0 functional models are always graphic schemes.  They have their own characteristics and rules of drafting.  We will talk about this a little bit later.  And now I would like to give a couple of examples of graphics efficiency.  Why do I emphasize this?  Most likely, after my statement about the need for a functional model of the company, many people thought that this was all optional, and it is possible to explain in words how this or that function works in the company.  That's what I want to talk about.

      And for starters, we‚Äôll do a little history.  Let us return to the distant 1877, during the Russian-Turkish war.  It was then that the printer Sytin first used graphics in the description of military operations.  Now, all this is customary for us; when describing any battle, each one has cards with arrows that clearly show the course of the battle.  And at that time military actions were described in words.  For each fight - many, many words.  And to understand in the end what was happening was very difficult. <br><br>  Therefore, Sytin‚Äôs idea was truly revolutionary - he began to print lithographic copies of maps indicating the fortifications and locations of military units.  These cards were called ‚ÄúFor readers of newspapers.  Benefit.  The idea turned out to be so urgent that the very first print run of the "Grants" was sold instantly.  And then these applications were very popular.  The reason is obvious.  Graphics helped to understand that with the help of some words it was almost impossible to make out. <br><br>  I can cite a similar example of the helplessness of verbal descriptions also from my own practice.  One of my customers is very requested to take up the implementation of ERP-system for his company.  On the question of whether they have any technical task, I received the answer: ‚ÄúYes, there is.  But it has 400 pages. ‚Äù  At the same time, the client complained very much that my colleagues, to whom he had addressed earlier, either refused the project at all, or called obviously overpriced prices.  After I saw that the technical task really has 400 pages, and it consists entirely of textual description, I understood the reasons for the behavior of the developers.  To read such a volume of text, to penetrate into it, to understand all the nuances only in order to understand the task and name the price - this is really very difficult. <br><br>  I offered this client an alternative option - to describe everything that is possible, graphically in the form of notations.  He showed him examples of modeling.  As a result, they are now rethinking their wishes and design specifications. <br><br>  I also know many other examples where graphical modeling of business processes helped in the work of my colleagues, business consultants and developers, and businessmen themselves. <br><br><h3>  Why is it important for my work? </h3><br>  My job is always related to making changes to the existing system.  And in order to make changes and get the desired result, you need to explore what already exists.  And it doesn‚Äôt matter what we do - we set up or install a CRM system from scratch, create an effective ERP system, and integrate various systems to increase the overall automation of work.  In any case, to begin with, it is necessary to get an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe existing scheme of work, and only after that, you can suggest any changes and think through solutions to the task. <br><br>  After studying the existing state of affairs, I, like any other third-party specialist, create a commercial offer in which I describe my current vision of the current situation, as well as the actions that need to be performed to solve the task, and, of course, the expected result. <br><br>  Such reports on the survey work are voluminous, occupy more than one page, which on the one hand is necessary, and on the other - complicates perception.  At first, like many people, I thought that lengthy reports are good, because a person pays for work and needs to provide him with maximum detailed information. <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://trinion.org/otchet_po_rezultatu_obsledovaniya_kompanii/">An example of one of my reports in text form</a> <a href="https://trinion.org/otchet_po_rezultatu_obsledovaniya_kompanii/"><br></a> <br>  In fact, it is important not to provide the volume, but to convey the essence as quickly and fully as possible.  Large volumes of text take time, which businessmen often have very little.  A graphics allows you to reduce the amount of my proposal and clearly, in an understandable form to show the solution.  As a result, my proposals were significantly reduced, graphics appeared in them, and decisions about starting cooperation began to be made faster. <br><br>  It is for this reason that I use visual models.  As you know, one picture is worth a thousand words.  And in the case of a description of business processes and options for the modernization of the business - this is true.  And here IDEF0 notations are very well suited. <br><br>  But for a start, let's understand the basic concepts of what notations are, why they are needed, what IDEF0 is, what the features and advantages of this method are. <br><br><h3>  What is a business process description notation </h3><br>  A notation is a business process description format, which is a collection of graphical objects used in modeling, as well as modeling rules. <br><br>  In essence, notations are a special graphical language that allows you to describe the work of a company, to demonstrate the interaction between different departments, i.e.  describe business processes.  Notations can be used for process or functional modeling. <br><br>  In general, notations can be called a programming language in business analysis. <br><br><h3>  What is IDEF0? </h3><br><blockquote>  IDEF0 is a functional modeling methodology (function modeling) and graphic notation designed to formalize and describe business processes.  A distinctive feature of IDEF0 is its emphasis on the hierarchy of objects.  IDEF0 discusses the logical relationships between jobs, not their time sequence (workflow). </blockquote>  Wikipedia <br><br>  The IDEF0 standard was developed in 1981 in the United States by the Department of the Air Force for the automation of industrial enterprises.  In the process of developing software, developers are faced with the need to develop new methods for analyzing business processes.  As a result, the IDEF0 functional modeling methodology has emerged, in which special IDEF0 notations are used for analysis. <br><br><h3>  Functional model of the company </h3><br>  The IDEF0 functional model is a set of blocks, each of which is a ‚Äúblack box‚Äù with inputs and outputs, controls and mechanisms that are detailed (decomposed) to the required level.  The most important feature is located in the upper left corner.  And functions are interconnected by means of arrows and descriptions of functional blocks.  In addition, each type of arrow or activity has its own meaning.  This model allows you to describe all the main types of processes, both administrative and organizational. <br><br>  Arrows can be: <br><br><ul><li>  Inbox - introductory, which pose a specific task. </li><li>  Outgoing - outputting activity. </li><li>  Managing (from top to bottom) - control mechanisms (provisions, instructions, etc.). </li><li>  Mechanisms (from bottom to top) - what is used to produce the necessary work. </li></ul><br>  Incoming and outgoing arrows would be more accurate to call input and output, since in English they are called Input and Output, respectively.  But the features of the translation and the usual names already look like it happened.  And yet, for the correct understanding of the terms, it is important to remember their meaning in this case.  This is also confirmed by the fact that this notation is created primarily for software development, and the terms should be translated more correctly in this point of view. <br><br>  Arrows are signed using nouns (experience, plan, rules), and blocks are signed with verbs, i.e.  they describe the actions that are being made (to create a product, to conclude a contract, to make a shipment). <br><br>  IDEF0 is a very simple and at the same time visual language describing business processes.  With this standard, it is possible to transfer information between developers, consultants and users.  The standard was very carefully developed, it is convenient for design, universal.  There are many tools for working with it, for example, VISIO, BPWIN, ERWIN, Bussines studio, etc. <br><br>  In addition, using IDEF0 to create business models is not only convenient, it is also correct.  This tool was developed for business intelligence, it was a long and thorough debugging and grinding.  Therefore, using IDEF0 to create a functional model without errors is much easier than without applying this standard. <br><br>  As you know, hammer nails best.  Of course, you can use other tools for this, but the hammer is the most functional and with its help it is easiest to hammer in a nail accurately and accurately.  So with the use of IDEF0 - this tool was created for functional modeling, and with its help you will be able to get the desired result much faster and more accurately. <br><br><h3>  An example of creating a functional model IDEF0 </h3><br>  In order to understand how to work with functional modeling, I will give an example of the process of writing an article. <br><br>  The main unit is ‚ÄúWrite an article.‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ae8/da6/f1a/ae8da6f1a5064401b8ae7fb5b7f62cc1.png"><br>  <i>An example of the description of the functional model of the top level</i> <br><br>  Incoming arrows - "Experience", "Information from third-party sources."  These are the inputs that you need to get started. <br><br>  The managers for writing the article are ‚ÄúPublishing Plan‚Äù, ‚ÄúPublisher Requirements‚Äù, ‚ÄúRussian Language Rules‚Äù. <br><br>  And in the role of "Mechanisms" are the author, copywriter, proofreader and software.  In this case, the author creates an audio material in which he collects all the thoughts and ideas that should be reflected in the article.  A copywriter is a person who creates on the basis of this material, guided by the requirements of the publisher, the publication plan and the rules of the Russian language, the text of the article.  Proofreader checks material for errors.  And the software is the tools that all participants in the process use. <br><br>  Thus, I set the basic parameters of the process, its input, output, as well as everything necessary for a successful process.  But this is only the main framework of the process.  This describes the general scheme of the company as a whole. <br><br>  In fact, the process of creating an article, like any business process, can and should be detailed.  To do this, I decompose the general ‚Äúwrite an article‚Äù block into related elements. <br><br>  In our case, the work is divided into 4 main stages: <br><br><ol><li>  Prepare audio. </li><li>  Prepare the text </li><li>  Prepare the text for publication. </li><li>  Post an article in the publication. </li></ol><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/80e/23c/2fa/80e23c2fa6cb4375bbc6547d1323b683.png"><br>  <i>An example of describing a functional model of a business process of the second level</i> <br><br>  The diagram clearly shows at what stage which controls and which mechanisms are involved. <br><br>  Thus, the author uses his knowledge and experience in creating audio, while he is guided by the publication plan and the requirements of the publisher.  The copywriter receives an audio recording at the entrance, from which, guided by the rules of the Russian language, creates the text.  The proofreader receives the text and checks it, also guided by the rules of the Russian language.  To publish an article in the publication requires special software. <br><br>  When creating a functional model, the key parameters are the goal and point of view.  Based on them, the modeling of the same processes may look somewhat different.  For example, in my case, the goal is to ‚Äútalk about the process of writing an article.‚Äù  And the point of view of a copywriter is ‚Äúwriting and publishing an article from the point of view of the process manager‚Äù. <br><br>  So, if the same process was described from the point of view of a copywriter, then the experience and the audio file from the author would be included.  In this case, under the Experience would have meant the experience of a copywriter, but not the manager or the author.  That is why the first thing to be determined when creating a business process model is to choose a point of view and clearly formulate a goal. <br><br>  Such modeling is not only clear, but also very convenient for making effective management decisions.  For example, in the above described business process there are two separate specialists - a copywriter and proofreader.  If I set the task to optimize the financing of the project, then I will see where it is and how it can be done thanks to the scheme.  So, the copywriter and the proofreader use approximately the same rules, but the copywriter receives audio, and gives the result as text, the proofreader accepts and gives the text.  And therefore, if necessary, I can, say, for half the cost of the duty of a proofreader, offer a copywriter.  So I will save money and time for the interaction of different specialists.  Of course, I understand all the merits of proofreaders and why it is better to work with individual specialists.  But I remind you - I have a task: cost optimization. <br><br>  Without such a visual tool, it would be more difficult to determine which blocks can be removed and, thus, optimize work. <br><br><h3>  How to create IDEF0 notation </h3><br>  There are many different software products that can be used to create notations.  Some are designed specifically for functional modeling, others are designed for any work with graphic elements.  Where and how you will build these models is up to you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/114/d17/02d/114d1702dca8494d8574a94d71b5f051.jpeg" align="right">  I personally believe that at the first stage there is nothing better than ordinary paper, a simple pencil and an eraser to make corrections in case of errors. <br><br>  In order to create a notation for existing business processes, i.e.  describe how the company is now working, you need to study the principles of work.  A third-party specialist (consultant, developer) conducts an interview for this.  At the first stage, the head of the company answers the questions, then in the process of detailing the notation, interviews are conducted with the staff responsible for the different stages of work. <br><br>  It is important to understand that as a result, 2 notations will be required.  The first will display business processes in the form of "as is".  You create it on the basis of interviews and coordinate every detail with the company's employees and the manager.  It is very important that your vision of the existing processes coincides with reality, that‚Äôs why confirmation at all levels is required. <br><br>  The second notation is ‚Äúhow it should be‚Äù.  It is created on the basis of the first and those changes that you propose to make in the structure of work to optimize and automate the work of the company in the framework of the task. <br><br><h3>  IDEF0 requirements </h3><br>  The basic requirements of the standard IDEF0, in principle, I described above and showed an example. <br><br><ol><li>  In the upper left corner is always the main element. </li><li>  All elements must have incoming and outgoing arrows, since to perform it is necessary to receive something at the entrance (order, task), and after processing at the exit it is necessary to transfer the finished product.  Incoming arrows are always on the left, outgoing arrows are on the right. </li><li>  Above - the controls, below - the mechanisms necessary to carry out the process. </li><li>  If there are several blocks on one sheet (screen), each next one is on the right and below the previous one. </li><li>  It is necessary to strive to create schemes in such a way that the intersection of the arrows is kept to the minimum necessary. </li></ol><br>  The IDEF0 standard also includes generally accepted notation, rules, requirements for blocks of diagrams, it has its own semantics.  You can get acquainted with them in detail in the document <a href="http://www.nsu.ru/smk/files/idef.pdf">‚ÄúMethodology of functional modeling IDEF0‚Äù</a> . <br><br><h3>  Typical mistakes </h3><br>  Functional modeling is performed using a variety of tools, including those not intended for modeling.  In the latter case, there is no check for errors and limitations of the standard.  The desire to increase visibility and lack of experience often ends with errors. <br><br><h4>  Using different colors </h4><br>  All elements in the diagram are equally important.  In functional modeling, there are no more or less important elements.  The disappearance of any lead to disruption of the process and production marriage. <br><br>  Often, when modeling on paper or in various programs, users try to increase visibility by using different colors.  This is one of the most common mistakes.  In fact, the use of multi-colored arrows and blocks only introduces additional confusion, and also distorts the perception of the scheme. <br><br>  Your model should be read in black and white, without any additional color solutions.  Such an approach at the same time helps to avoid misunderstandings and disciplines the creator of the model, as a result, the readability and literacy of the model increase. <br><br><h4>  Too many blocks </h4><br>  When compiling a model, they often try to display on one sheet all the nuances of the company's work with all the details.  The result is a very large number of blocks with a large number of control arrows.  Readability is lost. <br><br>  The best option is a detailed enough to understand the issue, and no more.  Detailed details of the work of each department or even an employee can be revealed when choosing a detailed view of a particular process.  And such a structure is created only if it is really needed for work or decision making. <br><br><h4>  Breakdown of structure when making adjustments </h4><br>  Carefully ensure that there is no confusion or processes without incoming, outgoing and other important elements.  For example, if in the example above, I consider it necessary to shift the point of view of a copywriter, I will remove the author from the scheme.  And then the control elements "author's experience and third-party sources", as well as the publication plan, become unnecessary.  After all, the author uses them.  Copywriter works with audio file.  And if they remain in the general scheme, then in detailing it will be incomprehensible where and to confuse. <br><br>  Similarly, if I decide to add a block, it is important to make sure that it also has all the necessary attributes.  Carefulness is very important here, as when modeling complex business processes, changes in one part of the model may entail changes in another.  They must be made. <br><br><h4>  Rules for the name of controls and blocks </h4><br>  It is important to remember a simple rule: control arrows are called nouns, blocks - verbs.  This is accepted in the IDEF0 standard, and this approach helps to avoid confusion and mistakes. <br><br>  Most often, mistakes are made when naming blocks.  For example, instead of "Create an article" write "Create an article."  The blocks in this approach are actions, and therefore they must always be verbs. <br><br><h3>  Benefits of using IDEF0 </h3><br><ul><li>  <b>The very first benefit is obvious - this is visibility.</b>  You yourself begin to understand how this or that system works, and you can also visually explain where the ‚Äúthin spots‚Äù in this system and how your solutions will help get rid of them. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Mutual understanding and lack of discrepancies.</b>  When discussing the work of a company using a functional model, you have visual and intuitive blocks of tasks with control elements.  In addition, functional modeling involves the creation of a glossary, if necessary, in which the conventions and terms are disclosed.  As a result, you speak the same language with a client, a manager, and other employees. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Simplicity and high speed model creation.</b>  Of course, learning to model is not as easy as it sounds.  After all, the scheme is, in fact, a super-dense flow of information, which is very good for understanding, but for the implementation of this flow, a special approach is required.  In this case, the analyst's brain acts as a very powerful press on the one hand, and a filter on the other.  But with experience, this process becomes very fast.  As a result, you get a tool that will help you to figure out for yourself what is happening in a particular system and, using a visual aid created in a short time, to illustrate important points to colleagues or customers. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Discipline and no mistakes.</b>  The IDEF0 standard implies strict limits and rules.  Such an approach disciplines, and the habit of acting within the framework of a standard helps to avoid mistakes through carelessness.  Any violations of the standard become immediately noticeable. </li></ul><br><h3>  What is the difficulty of using IDEF0 </h3><br>  It is important to understand that only in the simplest cases, two business analysts will create absolutely identical functional models for describing the company's work.  Any model is a reflection of the analyst's experience, the depth of understanding of the business that he seeks to describe, as well as, in some way, his personal point of view on this business.  Those.  a person develops a business model from the point of view of a manager, as if he is the leader. <br><br>  At the same time, I believe that a business analyst is not exactly a profession; every business executive or any system developer who analyzes business and seeks to build the most efficient system is engaged in business intelligence.  It is for these people and for these purposes that the IDEF0 tool is intended. <br><br>  That is why it is very important to constantly consult with the head of the company when developing a functional business model ‚Äúas is‚Äù, in order not to make a mistake, which will automatically entail mistakes at the stages of decomposition.  Also at the subsequent stages additional coordination with heads of structural divisions and employees may be required.  Only if your functional model "as is" will truly reflect the real state of affairs, can you make any changes and suggestions.  And to achieve high-quality results in such work, first of all, practical experience and knowledge of the characteristics of a particular type of business is required. <br><br>  More articles on this topic: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/trinion/blog/342448/">What is a business process and business process description</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/trinion/blog/332772/">Business modeling.</a>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/trinion/blog/332772/">Basic approaches</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/trinion/blog/354608/">We understand the concept of BPM.</a>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/trinion/blog/354608/">What is business process management?</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/trinion/blog/331254/">A brief description of BPMN with an example</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/trinion/blog/273025/">What is BPMS</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/trinion/blog/331946/">Using GAP analysis to identify and coordinate project tasks</a> </li></ul><br><br>  Also, currently I am preparing a book for publication and an online course in which I will describe in detail my own vision of the process approach to business, as well as my own practical experience in the field of functional and process modeling.
