      Today, the Mobius 2015 program is 85% complete: <b>18 reports were</b> announced from the planned 21. All reports were divided into <b>5</b> groups: Devices, Tools, Tests, Security and Others.  Now, 4 weeks before the conference, it's time to go through them briefly. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Group 1: Devices </h5><br>  In addition to smartphones and tablets, there are other mobile devices.  This time they will be devoted to two reports: a report on the development for Chromecast and the development for SmartWatches. <br><br>  <b>Anton Keks, Codeborne - Chromecast, or Why is the best way to spend 30 ‚Ç¨</b> <br>  Chromecast is a small dongle from Google for the HDMI port of the TV, looks like a USB stick.  Recently, an API has appeared for it that allows you to run your HTML / JS applications directly on your device, using a computer or phone as a remote control for content management.  Anton will conduct a Live Coding session and show you how to program under Chromecast. <br><br>  <b>Alexey Rybakov, DataArt - Development for SmartWatches: Apple WatchKit, Android Wear and TizenOS</b> <br>  The current situation on the wearable device market will be shown, as well as how to start developing a wearable application.  An overview of the technologies available to the developer today will be given: API and Frameworks for AppleWatch, WatchFace API in Android Wear.  Let's figure out what is needed for the successful creation of the mega-popular WatchFace.  Some examples from the report will be tested on Moto 360 (download and debug application). <br><br><h5>  Group 2: Tools </h5><br>  Traditionally, development tools are one of the most important parts of any developer conference.  Mobius 2015 is not an exception: this time we have 6 reports for Tulah, half of which are dedicated to cross-platform development. <br><br>  <b>Matvey Malkov, 2GIS - Jet engine for your Android application</b> <br>  A report on how to build a fully reactive Android application using RxJava.  Key concepts to be covered in the report: immutable data, event streams, flatMap, zip, combineLatest, filter and other charms of FP, MVVM charms on Android. <br><br>  <b>Alexey Zinoviev, Tamtek - Android Geo Apps: In Soviet Russia, latitude and longitude are looking for YOU!</b> <br>  A report on how to build geo-mobile applications, which frameworks to use, whether to connect Google Maps or Bing Maps, how to bypass the pitfalls associated with limits and text licenses, as well as the most popular types of similar applications, their pros and cons.  After this report, knowledge of Location Based Services, Maps Frameworks, cases of correct use of personal geodata, energy optimization, as well as OpenSource mapping components based on data from the Open Street Maps project will be structured in the listener's head. <br><br>  <b>Danil Nikiforov, Tamtek - Couchbase lite - NoSQL for mobile platforms</b> <br>  In the world of mobile development, everyone is used to pure SQLite or CoreData for data storage.  Synchronization with the server is a complex topic, as you need to properly handle connection breaks, conflicts, etc. This will focus on Couchbase Lite, an alternative lightweight native framework for iOS that implements document-oriented and synchronized storage for mobile devices and embedded systems. <br><br>  <b>Victor Korsun, Zeptolab - Designing Cross-Platform Games</b> <br>  It will be about Zeptolab storage solutions for graphic resources to get the perfect visual quality.  It will be a question of the evolution of the engine from the time of the original Cut The Rope to the present.  The main cross-platform principles, common problems caused by the richness of resolutions and devices and the influence of this diversity on the game logic will be revealed. <br><br>  <b>Sergey Lalov, Spiral Code Studio - Go and Google App Engine - this is awesome!</b> <br>  Google App Engine provides an excellent platform for reliable cross-platform applications, both regular and gaming.  The report is dedicated to the Go language and features of its use on Google App Engine. <br><br>  <b>Mikhail Samarin, Futurice - Cross-platform UI with Unity</b> <br>  Starting with version 4.6, Unity contains a new subsystem for building user interfaces.  The report is devoted to the effective use and features of this new approach to creating a user interface for your cross-platform games and interactive graphic applications, as well as its adaptation to fundamentally different form factors of modern devices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/89a/197/c51/89a197c512f8412eb75fd63b9c4965f7.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Group 3: Tests </h5><br>  Testing mobile applications is a real headache: there are few tools, hardware and operating systems - a zoo, and in combination with each other - a zoo in a square.  Therefore, a couple of reports on Mobius 2015 will be devoted to testing: one is testing games, and the second is testing traditional applications using the example of an email client. <br><br>  <b>Alexander Smirnov, Mail.Ru - Bu shall not pass</b> <br>  A report about a series of automatic project quality control tools that Mail.Ru iOS-mail developers have introduced on their project: UI-tests, Unit-tests, snapshot-tests, integrity monitoring of different build options with one code base, filling in meta-information in the repository, verification of localization, live reports on new tasks, crashes, reviews, etc., compiler extension, fuzzing, extended alpha builds, logging. <br><br>  <b>Phillip Keks, Creative Mobile - How to teach robots to play games?</b> <br>  How to write automatic tests for the game, if the game interface is non-standard, interactivity is complex, and there is not a single library and no ready-made solution on the market?  Using the example of Unity3D, the author and the audience will plunge right into the code.  It will show you how to write understandable serviced tests and how and where to run them.  The report will be of interest to developers far from the gaming industry. <br><br><h5>  Group 4: Security </h5><br>  Almost half of last year‚Äôs Mobius reports were somehow dedicated to security in mobile applications.  Not all of them were successful, so experts attacked us from all over the country with shouts of "how long ?!" and "just as impossible!".  In response, we kindly invited them to make the reports themselves and in practice show what is the cool report on security.  The guys for the market responded, so this time we have as many as 6 (!) Reports about Mobile Security.  Time will tell, it's a lot or a little :) <br><br>  <b>Yuri Leonichev, Yandex - Divide and Conquer</b> <br>  A report on how and why Yandex has a common library for user authentication in mobile applications, what its stuffing and additional functions are, what are the development prospects, what difficulties it had to face in the development process due to the evolution of the iOS and Android operating systems.  Developers will find out what rake can occur when creating an ecosystem with a large number of applications and shared accounts. <br><br>  <b>Mikhail Dudarev, Licel - Full root: Practical tips for the survival of Android and iOS applications in untrusted environments</b> <br>  Report on various aspects of security on mobile platforms: the necessary actions before installing in the Market, application delivery to the device and first checks, environmental analysis, root / jailbreak detection and other signs of ‚Äúother‚Äù activity.  At the end of the report, you will be told about how your application does not fall under the false positive antivirus, and what to do if this happens. <br><br>  <b>Ivan Kinash, Licel - The new dress of the king: Using the hardware capabilities of modern processors to create a secure Android environment</b> <br>  Is there a way to protect user data and applications on Android from outside interference?  Architecture Trusted Execution Environment.  How does the ARM TrustZone work?  What is Samsung Knox, and why this technology was transferred to Google.  Will this gugoid technology save?  The report will provide answers to all the above questions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dad/0d2/e54/dad0d2e54a7d4b2294140a86889b4fe4.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Vladimir Ivanov, Kaspersky Lab - Mobile threats: defend yourself!</b> <br>  How do mobile malware steal your money using your own phone?  What rake are banking application developers attacking and how to avoid these rakes?  How to provide a comprehensive protection of the banking application, making life more difficult for virus writers? <br>  The report will answer all these questions. <br><br>  <b>Andrey Belenko, NowSecure - What is worth and what not to do to protect data of iOS applications</b> <br>  The purpose of this report is to help developers better protect their applications (or make life easier for their application security team, if any). <br>  This will focus on the protection of ‚Äústored data‚Äù in iOS applications.  Several common error patterns will be considered.  We will see how the data can be extracted from the device, and what measures developers should take to avoid this.  Although most of the talk will focus on iOS, some ideas may be relevant to other platforms. <br><br><h5>  Group 5: Others </h5><br>  Three reports did not fall into any of the categories.  If you have thoughts about which category they belong to - write in a personal or comments. <br><br>  <b>Denis Kretov, Notissimus - iBeacon Technology in Payment Solutions</b> <br>  IBeacon technology is applicable for smartphones based on iOS, GoogleAndroid, WinPhone.  The payment solution is a quick purchase service using iBeacon technology.  Listeners of the report will learn about iBeacon: how to use this technology in practice, how to use the Azure cloud and how to integrate payment solutions into mobile phones. <br><br>  <b>Kirill Bessonov, TCS Bank - Analytics for mobile applications</b> <br>  How often does the user log into your application, from which devices, what technical problems arise, what does the application do and what preferences does it have?  These and other questions will be answered by mobile analytics services.  The report will consider the types of analytics, the order of implementation and the main tools: Google Analytics, Yandex.Metrica and Flurry.  You will learn about all the basic capabilities of each of the analytics systems, see examples of integrating the SDK into your application (Android, iOS, Windows Phone) and look at the benchmarking analysis that will help you choose the analytics system that best suits you. <br><br>  <b>Yuriy Buyanov, Classmates - Comfortable development of mobile projects</b> <br>  A report for developers interested in improving various processes around the development of mobile applications.  Simple but effective tips will be given that will make you happier, as they will save you from a heap of unnecessary work on keeping the project in working condition, namely: storing code, dependencies, continuous integration, static analysis, code review, interaction with the server team ( API documentation, development automation), interaction with testers (delivery of builds, collection of information about errors, diagnostic tools, application configuration). <br><br><h5>  Conclusion </h5><br>  Again: <br><ul><li>  Peter </li><li>  April 3, Friday </li><li>  <a href="http://mobiusconf.com/%3Futm_refcode%3D20ed16bc0cc965e9df0b5897a2abcf28073ae6f9">conference site</a> </li></ul><br><br>  In the end, as always, we ask you to evaluate how interesting this or that topic is for you.  Depending on your ratings, we will distribute the reports on halls: the most popular reports will fall into the largest hall.  Thanks in advance to everyone for their participation! <br><br>  If there are comments, questions or any suggestions on the conference program - write in the comments! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/252273/">https://habr.com/ru/post/252273/</a></p>
