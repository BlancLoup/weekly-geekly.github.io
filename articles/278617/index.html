Since the release of the previous beta, a lot of good has been done, both in terms of correcting errors and shortcomings, and in terms of expanding the capabilities of existing functions.  Naturally, not without new features.  We will now tell about all this in order. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c8b/681/caf/c8b681cafea7c637515fc90038ec6f82.png"></div><br>  For the corrected errors, one thing can be said - there have been many such corrections since the second beta, which was released in December last year.  Therefore, this article does not make sense to publish the entire list, and those interested in details can read this list on a <a href="https://update.vivaldi.com/update/1.0/relnotes/1.0.403.24.html">special page</a> .  In the meantime, we will talk about what functions were being worked on to expand their capabilities and what was new. <br><br>  Since the release of the second beta, the following new (or improved) features have become most noticeable: 
      <br>

      <b>Beta 3 (release date 03/03/2016)</b> <br><br>  Export Bookmarks <br>  Interface scale <br>  Global / individual page scale <br>  Close tab by double click <br>  Color tab settings <br>  Manage closing / opening tabs <br>  Sessions <br>  Unloading tabs from memory <br>  CSS debugger <br><br>  All these functions can be divided into several important areas, which we will discuss. <br><br>  <b>Appearance and display of content</b> <br><br>  Here, we first of all worked on the ability to customize the display of both the browser interface itself and the content of pages for high resolution displays.  In order to change the scale of the interface, it is enough to specify the desired size in the appearance settings: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/383/df8/579/383df85797b159828075c8a7deac30be.png" alt="image"></div><br>  Also appeared a similar global setting for page scale - in the section of the web page: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2dc/686/0da/2dc6860da8ddf676302a95380cc5a08b.png" alt="image"></div><br>  In this way, you can customize the most appropriate display for your eyes, both of the browser interface elements and the web pages you are viewing. <br><br>  Another new feature related to the appearance settings is the result of the empowerment of the previously introduced.  In one of the previous versions, we added the ability to use an individual color for each tab, depending on the page being viewed (more precisely, on the main color of the favicon of the site).  Now you can decide for yourself which interface element should be highlighted, the actual tab or its environment: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a38/768/cf6/a38768cf637c4d332d98f98aceecb7f0.png" alt="image"></div><br>  The result will look something like this: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9f2/b91/efa/9f2b91efa2de7dab423f06a8c1bdda81.png" alt="image"></div><br>  We hope this small improvement will allow you to make working with the browser a little more comfortable. <br><br>  <b>Browser control</b> <br><br>  This is another important area we are constantly working on.  This includes, for example, the long-requested tab-closing of users by double-clicking, but even more popular were requests for working with the tabs themselves.  In particular, in what order they should open and close, and also where they should be placed on the tab bar.  For obvious reasons, to fulfill the wishes of all users with a couple of options will not work here - we have all worked out a very different style of work over the past years.  Therefore, we decided to go, perhaps in a more difficult way, but at the same time more correct - by letting you choose which principle of working with tabs you will use. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/60e/a26/dcc/60ea26dcccb28d7d1cf79a6ad6918e07.png" alt="image"></div><br>  As you can see, the settings section related to tabs has grown quite well, but at the moment we are interested in two options - the position of the new tab and the browser actions when closing the tab. <br><br>  So, a new tab can now open in three different positions: to the right of all tabs, to the right of the active tab, or to the right of the associated tab.  A linked tab is a tab opened as a link from the active tab.  Thus, if you open a certain link in the background tab, for example, from Wikipedia, the next link from the same active page will open to the right of the opened one before that.  And so on.  Get a kind of group of tabs, interconnected and located compactly. <br><br>  You can also use a different behavior when closing the tab you are viewing.  By default, you will be moved to the previous linked tab, if there is one (that is, to the left of the one to be closed).  If there are no related tabs, or if you have enabled the <b>Go to the next</b> option <b>in the order of switching</b> , then when you close the tab, you will be moved to the tab according to the browser settings in the Tab <b>Features</b> section. <br><br>  In general, it is quite difficult to explain, you can just experiment with different combinations of settings and see which behavior you find most comfortable. <br><br>  <b>Work with the data of web pages</b> <br><br>  In this category, you can highlight features such as <b>Sessions</b> .  This is also a long-requested feature and at the moment the basic functionality is implemented, further it is planned to expand the capabilities of the sessions both in the direction familiar to users and opening up new features.  While you can work with sessions through the menu <b>File</b> : <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fc4/c23/498/fc4c234982d50b5299f00affba5ff06b.png" alt="image"></div><br>  But the following function is intended to partially solve the problem of the ‚Äúsores‚Äù inherited from Chromium - clogging the computer‚Äôs memory with the data of the pages viewed due to the creation of a separate process for each tab.  The solution, of course, is not ideal, but sometimes unloading one or several currently inactive pages from the computer‚Äôs memory can help maintain network comfort for long hours (the function is temporarily disabled in Linux - until the bug is fixed): <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c62/ebb/292/c62ebb292cc9ee767608f27c8d850f17.png" alt="image"></div><br>  The <b>CSS debugger</b> function also works in some way with the content of web pages, but it will be useful, perhaps, only for web developers.  You can enable this feature in the Effects page: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/397/aee/6dc/397aee6dcfeaa8cabdc1caa669fd4e27.png" alt="image"></div><br><br>  <b>Where to put something?</b> <br><br>  Yes, not an idle question.  This is a beta version, this branch is separated from the one where we release weekly test builds.  Therefore, you need to update the previous beta number 2, if you have it, of course.  However, if it is, then auto-update should work without additional gestures.  As for the installation of this third beta on top of the test build, this is, as they say, at your own peril and risk.  And is it necessary?  We recommend to keep the beta version on the computer as the main browser, and test versions should be used strictly for its intended purpose - for testing and catching bugs.  If you need to transfer your personal data from one browser version to another, we <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/vivaldi/blog/277741/">published the</a> corresponding instructions <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/vivaldi/blog/277741/">relatively recently</a> . <br><br>  That's all.  We wish you a good weekend and do not forget to install today's beta version: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/conversation/4ea/e17/e89/4eae17e895a661ec3d60a7612c9f92ce.png" alt="image"></div><br><br>  You can report any errors found at the <a href="https://vivaldi.com/bugreport/">same address</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/278617/">https://habr.com/ru/post/278617/</a></p>
