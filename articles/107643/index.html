There is a pivot table and comments of those who compared. <br>  There is no playing along with the participants, juggling with facts and other jeans. <br><br>  The experiment was conducted as part of my teaching a course on web technologies at VolgGTU.  To perform the work, a dedicated server of the company in which I work was used, in addition to the state university. <br>  For especially corrosive comrades, I‚Äôll make a reservation that the company is Bitrix Gold Partner and has a lot of points from Yumi. <br>  Representatives of each of the systems with which I am familiar (Kotyrev, Ryzhikov, Sidorenko, Solonchuk) will learn about the details and the results of the study from this topic.  I don‚Äôt trade in research, it‚Äôs interesting for me to support the industry. <br>  Before minus topic for the fact that it is about the box systems that you may not like, read it.  Or just pass by. <br>  There is no agitation, there is analysis. <br><br>  So, the task-system-criteria-test-result. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Task </h4><br>  As part of the laboratory work on usability and hosting, I gave students links to distribution kits of systems, hosting, minimal instructions.  They had to deliver demo or trial versions of the online store, work on them as site administrators, evaluate convenience, create a report. <br>  The parameters studied are the criteria: the functionality of the demo solutions, convenience, quality, clarity from the point of view of several roles: the administrator who puts the site, the user-buyer, the content manager and the administrator of the control panel. <br>  The quality of the systems was not evaluated as development platforms, the quality of the code was not directly evaluated (although it is indirectly visible by the number of installation problems and stability). <br>  Not evaluated the process of stretching your design.  Just what is said.

    <h5>  Objective </h5><br>  Get acquainted with the concept of hosting, installing a CMS system on a hosting service, conduct a comparative analysis of 1C-Bitrix and UMI.CMS systems, draw conclusions <br><br><h5>  Working process </h5><br>  0. We get access. <br>  Each student is allocated 2 third level domains on a domain *** <br>  for example sb12. ***. ru for Bitrix and su12. ***. ru for UMI <br><br>  each has 2 databases to install systems.  username is the same as the database name <br><br>  access phpmyadmin ***. ru / myadmin <br><br>  in the folder of each domain there is a stub file index.html <br>  it can and should be removed, it will interfere with work. <br><br>  on the hosting, you can do anything, except for downloading scripts that are not provided for in the laboratory work <br><br>  Make a report. <br>  The report must include passwords to the systems. <br><br>  Student's assessment does not depend on his sympathies for a particular system.  You can put at least all -2 (very bad) in the columns, if you can argue it.  I will reduce the score for the hack and superficial approach.  The main thing is analysis and argumentation. <br><br>  examples of installed systems - the full address is hidden, students were provided with working versions of both systems, which I put: <br>  su12. ***. en / s12_umi TRnvFHm2 <br>  sb12. ***. en / s12_bitrix fKlGrbSb <br><br><h4>  Systems </h4><br>  As it has already become clear, this is a test version of competing systems with demons available for download.  According to the principle of fair play, all participants in equal conditions, did not warn anyone about anything, the server was equally ready to receive both systems. <br><br><h5>  BITRIX - 1c-bitrix.ru </h5><br>  <a href="http://www.1c-bitrix.ru/download/cms.php">www.1c-bitrix.ru/download/cms.php#tab-bitrixsetup-link</a> <br>  Installation data <br>  business demo <br>  Installation Solution - Online Store (the experiment was carried out already at the Hermitage) <br><br><h5>  UMI-CMS.ru </h5><br>  <a href="http://www.umi-cms.ru/downloads/test_umicms/umicms_commerce_trial/">www.umi-cms.ru/downloads/test_umicms/umicms_commerce_trial</a> <br>  we get in your name UMI trial key <br>  When installing - Trial key <br>  Template <br>  New version of online store on xslt-template engine <br><br><h4>  Criteria </h4><br>  Each student compiled a report of such a structure and derived the average value of the rating of each system for each indicator. <br>  Numerical indicators were estimated from -2 to 2 on the so-called "expectations scale". <br>  -2 - significantly worse than expected, very bad <br>  -1 - worse than expected, bad <br>  0 - the job was not completed due to technical reasons or did not start <br>  1 - meets expectations, well <br>  2 - significantly better than expected, very good <br>  Each rating must be reasoned with at least 1 phrase. <br><br><h6>  1. Convenience and clarity of the system supplier website </h6><br>  1.1.  Ease of finding the right data on the site <br>  1.2.  The quality of the texts, the clarity of the documentation (if you used it) <br>  1.3.  Overall impression - a free comment of at least 5 proposals for stage 1 <br><br><h6>  2.

Design quality <br>  3.2.  Demonstration quality <br>  3.3.  Structure and Navigation <br>  3.4.  Functionality <br><br><h6>  4. Convenience and functionality of the system from the point of view of the site content manager </h6><br>  We evaluate the convenience of performing typical tasks. <br>  We supply fulfillment of EVERY task 1 with a screenshot <br>  4.1.  Change browser title for homepage <br>  4.2.  Store name change (displayed in the header on the main page) <br>  4.3.  Change the text on the main page to your <br>  4.4.  Editing product <br>  4.5.

Adding 3 products to each group (choose specific products yourself) <br>  4.9.  Complete removal of one product (not the one added on its own) <br>  4.10.  Complete removal of one product group (not the one added by us) <br><br><h6>  5. Convenience and functionality of the site admin panel (/ bitrix for 1C-Bitrix and / admin for UMI.CMS) </h6><br>  5.1.  Functionality. <br>  5.1.1.  Map the system administration panel <br>  5.1.2.  Choose 3 different sections of the 2nd level of the system administration panel and describe their functionality, convenience (there should not be any repetitions among students). <br><br>  Example of a Level 2 Section for Bitrix (Content Section does not select) <br>  Settings - Performance <br>  Services - Polls <br><br>  Example of a Level 2 Section for UMI (Do not select Structure Section) <br>  Configuration \ Languages <br>  Data Exchange \ Data Export <br><br>  5.1.3.  Rate the functionality of the administration panel according to the scale of expectations from -2 to 2 with arguments <br><br>  5.2.  Convenience <br>  Evaluate the convenience of the administration panel as a whole on a scale of expectations from -2 to 2 with arguments <br><br><h6>  6. Conclusions </h6><br>  6.1.  Create a summary table of the assessment of each system for each parameter, display the average rating of each system for each parameter <br>  6.2.  Write conclusions on the operation of each system.  Indicate what you liked most and did not like, what surprised you most about each system. <br>  Specify which system you would like to work with if there is a choice. <br><br><h4>  Test subjects </h4><br>  These are 11 students of the 5th course of the Faculty of Electronics and Computer Engineering, quite normal.  Some were familiar with the web, but had not previously encountered any of the systems. <br><br>  It is strange that some did not immediately cope with the installation of systems on the server.  Honestly, I had nothing to do with it, before I gave the task, I put each system under student rights and did the work. <br><br><h4>  Result </h4><br>  The task was issued to 11 people.  3 scored, the rest did.  Someone quickly and immediately, someone seemed to be dragging tulle through blackberry bushes - but I received reports. <br>  8 reports.  I quote points assigned to systems and comments. <br>  Representatives of each of the systems, if they are interested, I will send an archive with reports.  There are comments on each problem and motivation of ratings. <br><br>  Long puzzled how to show statistics so that everything was clear.  I present my attempts to create a visual diagram. <br>  In the rows - indicators.  Each was rated on a scale of -2 to 2 each student for each system.  The indicator describes one consumer property of the system under study.  For simplicity, all indicators are considered equilibrium. <br><br>  There are 2 groups of columns: Yumi and Bitrix, respectively.  Within each group of columns, marks are given by each of the 8 students.  In some places there are zeros (a student made such an assessment), in some places omissions (the task was understood by students unequally). <br><br>  For the analysis, the average for each indicator for each system, the average for the student and the average for the system in general are calculated. <br>  The winners in each nomination are highlighted in bold, the scores for clarity are painted in red and green colors. <br>  The results are obvious. <br> <a title="when clicking is larger" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b58/4d2/687/b584d2687bf1d4de78fd1d602a0b412e.png" alt="with a larger click"></a> <br><br>  It seems to me that the advantages and disadvantages of the systems, which appeared in these conditions, are quite visible. <br><br><h4>  Excerpts from student reports (arguments, conclusions) </h4><br><h5>  Report 1 </h5><br>  Bitrix <br>  Quality product from professionals.  The first acquaintance with him left <br>  pleasant impression.  If there are any flaws in the system, you can close them <br>  eyes looking at the provided functionality and power. <br>  Liked: <br>  ‚Ä¢ easy editing mode; <br>  ‚Ä¢ documentation; <br>  ‚Ä¢ demonstration set of goods; <br>  ‚Ä¢ functional; <br>  ‚Ä¢ design; <br>  Did not like: <br>  ‚Ä¢ general ‚Äúcomplexity‚Äù of the administrative panel (documentation helps, but is lost <br>  time); <br>  ‚Ä¢ the way of defining the data template for the product is not obvious; <br><br>  UMI.CMS <br>  A promising CMS, but not very impressive against Bitrix. <br>  Liked: <br>  ‚Ä¢ fairly simple creation of data templates; <br>  ‚Ä¢ design; <br>  ‚Ä¢ functional; <br>  Did not like: <br>  ‚Ä¢ demonstration set of goods; <br>  ‚Ä¢ edit mode (F2); <br>  ‚Ä¢ congestion of the administrative interface; <br>  Selection <br>  If I had to develop an online store, then I would choose Bitrix, let <br>  5% percent of Bitrix features will be applied to the problem being solved, but experience <br>  with such a system is very valuable. <br><br><h5>  Report 2 </h5><br>  When installing UMI, I immediately made a pleasant impression. By the time Bitrix was delivered, I had already managed to look around with the appearance, try adding / deleting goods and news. <br>  With Bitrix there were difficulties only during installation and sometimes when searching for the necessary items in the admin panel, but in general the system did not cause any difficulties. <br>  Sometimes they strained timeout errors 504, but this is probably the fault of the hosting. <br>  In Bitrix, only the spelling mistake in the word Registered surprised. <br>  If you had a choice, you would agree to work with both systems. <br><br><h5>  Report 3 </h5><br>  Bitrix <br>  When working with this CMS, I liked that you can add any site components to edit when editing a page.  I liked the convenience and functionality of the administrative panel interface.  Very quickly, you can build on Bitrix a whole information portal.  We are also pleased with the good informational support, both for developers and for users on the Bitrix support site (the presence of video and text courses, divided by modules and with good examples). <br>  UMI.CMS <br>  When working with this CMS, I liked the ability to edit the page on the fly, this feature allows you to see what the page will look like after editing, right during editing.  There is a nice opportunity to add notes to the page.  The lack of additional functionality in the administration panel upset, as well as the lack of a tree structure in the administration panel. <br>  My choice <br>  If I had the task to develop an online store, then I would choose Bitrix as a platform, for the reason that it has everything that could satisfy the customer, and I would not need to write my code when I needed it.  Summing up, I‚Äôll say Bitrix is ‚Äã‚Äãworth the money they‚Äôre asking for. <br><br><h5>  Report 4 </h5><br>  1C-Bitrix. <br>  A convenient system that provides a huge number of opportunities for managing the site.  However, working with it is hampered by the fact that, to put it mildly, it slows down in edit mode (unlike the same UMI.CMS).  But the administration panel is smart here and is suitable for those who like to work with the tree structure of the menu. <br><br><h5>  UMI.CMS. </h5><br>  In editing mode, the system works quickly, which makes life easier for the administrator.  But the administration panel itself is poorer in capabilities than in 1C-Bitrix.  The local file manager makes life even harder, for example, when adding photos of a product (and this is one of the most important and frequently repeated operations). <br><br>  It is difficult to say which system I would work with if there was a choice: they are still good in their own way.  But considering what a surprise UMI.CMS prepared for me during installation, I would stop at 1C-Bitrix (this is more reliable). <br><br><h5>  Report 5 </h5><br>  Bitrix: <br>  The system is good.  It has a rich functionality.  But the internet toli I stupid, the web hosting was such.  Working with the site was very hard. (Maybe I didn‚Äôt figure out what can be configured).  Very long feedback.  Frequent breaks of communication (error 504).  Long page editing mode is included.  The inclusion of this mode is beautiful but not very convenient.  In edit mode, you can safely navigate around the site. <br>  UMI-cms: <br>  An interesting system.  Editing with the F2 button is very convenient in contrast to the bitrix.  Worked more brightly (although it may be due to the weather).  But in edit mode it is very inconvenient to walk around the site.  Because you can not click on the links.  Subsections are not displayed in subsections, although you can create one. <br><br>  Between CMS data, I can‚Äôt say exactly which one I would choose.  It all depends on the task.  If you need to make a business card site, then I would prefer UMI.  If you make a more serious project, I would prefer Bitrix.  It has a lot of good, useful, and most importantly high-quality modules, but it also needs more host machine resources (well, I thought so) <br><br><h5>  Report 6 </h5><br>  Bitrix: <br>  I enjoyed working with this system.  Convenient structure that allows you to quickly find the information you need.  I did not like the fact that new products are somehow strangely added, since  You can not immediately select the type of information added.  Liked the admin part of the system, well structured.  A lot of content in the demo version.  Easy to install. <br><br>  UMI-cms: <br>  Not a bad system.  Most liked the easy one-button page editing.  Admin panel is conveniently placed in the right-upper corner and has a stowing structure.  Disadvantages, it was delivered from the second time and it is crooked, there is no content in the example, adding new products is not clear how it works, the submenu did not work, navigation through the admin panel also did not work. <br><br>  If you had a choice, would choose Bitrix <br><br><h5>  Report 7 </h5><br>  Bitrix <br>  I liked the opportunity to edit the structure of the page right on the fly without any dull text fields into which the system dumps the nasty code of the page.  I liked the presence of the component of the page, i.e.  even a form is a component that has certain parameters and can be inserted on several pages, but at the same time it will have different states on these pages.  I liked the convenience and functionality, it is very rare to find a product with such a friendly interface of the administrative panel.  Using only one section of "Content", you can build a whole information portal on the basis of Bitrix in just a day - the main thing is to understand the enormous possibilities of Bitrix.  I was also pleasantly surprised by the documentation and training courses for developers and users.  The only thing that did not like (rather, it is a whim) is the resource intensity of the Bitrix engine. <br>  UMI.CMS <br>  Before installing this CMS, I had a better opinion about it.  Let this system from the frontend look very comfortable, then from the side of the backend it is just awful.  The developers decided to put all the simpler things into the administrative panel without thinking about convenience.  In principle, it is possible to work with CMS, but only from the front-end.  There is potential in the CMS itself, but it is very difficult to uncover it by means provided by the site administrator.  Surprised in the system is the ability to edit on the fly, which can jump and Bitrix. <br>  My choice <br>  If I were asked, on what I would prefer to develop a site, I would immediately say that Bitrix.  This system has proven itself in the performance of this work.  I will continue to study it and make attempts to implement my own projects. <br><br><h5>  Report 8 </h5><br>  Bitrix: <br>  I enjoyed working with this system.  Convenient structure that allows you to quickly find the information you need.  Liked the admin part of the system, well structured.  Impressed with the way to install CMS.  The downside of the system is the lack of free design templates. <br>  UMI-cms: <br>  The system as a whole did not like.  Problems arose during and after installation.  The system could not be installed properly either on the provided hosting or on the local host: the system was installed without demo content. <br><br>  I prefer 1C-Bitrix. <br><br><h4>  My findings </h4><br>  I tried to organize the experiment in such a way that in fair conditions it showed the work and typical problems of each system. <br><br>  There are 2 more laboratory works for the same students, where we could analyze more complex technological operations than simple installation and management of a ready-made demo system on these or other systems, engines, and frameworks. <br><br>  I am waiting for opinions, I will listen to sensible advice. <br><br><h4>  PS </h4><br>  The main observation is essentially that Bitrix and Yumi are compared, which, they say, are not indicative and do not cover the market.  I would be pleased to hold a similar event with the participation of TYPO3, DRUPAL, HostCMS, Zend Framefork, if I understand what task they are setting?  Systems of different caliber, degrees of abstraction, even ideology, they are often used at different levels. <br>  What can be done on these systems so that the conditions remain fair? <br>  There is only 1 idea: to give a custom design and offer to pile on a site with a given primitive functionality. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/107643/">https://habr.com/ru/post/107643/</a></p>
