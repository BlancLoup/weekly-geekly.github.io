We are engaged in the outsourcing of various types of accounting, personnel office work and payroll.  Or in other words - automation and optimization of business processes related to financial and accounting accounting, as well as personnel management.  There are related services - inventory, recruiting, outstaffing, legal support.  It is important to note that Intercomp takes responsibility to the regulatory authorities, including compensation of fines in case of detection of an error made by our fault. <br><br>  Such activities are impossible without the use of electronic document management, SaaS technologies and modern IT solutions that ensure information security.  We will definitely write about the examples of their implementation in the following materials. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In addition, the main advantages of outsourcing (as well as its problems and prospects) are similar for almost all of its types.  What opens up many areas for discussion, interesting within the site.  Scalability, continuity, reduction of dependence on the human factor, increased transparency and manageability, this is not a complete list of topics that ‚Äúhave‚Äù our business with the IT sphere.

      Finally, blogging will provide new opportunities to get feedback.  It is possible that from our current customers.  Among them, unknown startups of 3-5 people come across to anyone, for whom it is important to rid themselves of the routine and save on non-core tasks.  And there are real giants who pay a lot of attention to working with staff.  For example, the company Cisco Systems, which for many years in a row is in the <a href="http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/bestcompanies/2010/full_list/index.html">TOP 100 best employers</a> . <br><br>  But to the majority here we are almost certainly not familiar, so the first thing we will tell about ourselves. <br><br>  <i>Do you remember how it all started</i> <br><br>  Intercomp was incorporated in the United States in 1994, its birthplace is Houston, Texas.  At that time, the company's founders had been working in the post-Soviet space for four years and saw great potential in an actively developing market.  Initially, the main activity was payroll.  Shareholder expectations of high growth rates were confirmed in practice, after which all efforts were fully concentrated in the CIS.  After 19 years, the business was bought out by the Russian investment fund <a href="http://elbcp.ru/">Elbrus Capital</a> , as already proven to be successful. <br><br>  Initially, a small team of Intercomp developed rapidly and now has more than 750 specialists.  Our units operate in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Ryazan, Nizhny Novgorod, Kiev, Astana, Almaty and Baku, but the main services are available remotely and in other cities of Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan. <br><br>  Intercomp is considered to be the recognized Russian leader in the accounting function outsourcing market.  Since the appearance in 2009 of the corresponding ranking of the Expert rating agency, our company has been steadily leading it. <br><br>  In 2012, a subsidiary was created to provide services to the public sector.  As you know, accounting in such organizations has significantly different specifics, so it was decided to divide the specialists into teams: commercial and budget. <br><br>  <i>Small business - large market</i> <br><br>  Last year, in addition to our ‚Äúclassic‚Äù services, which are focused on medium and large businesses and suggest an individual approach to each client, a convenient product for small and medium businesses was developed - <a href="http://www.intercomp.ru/intercomp-direct">Intercomp Direct</a> , which can be attributed to SaaS products.  At the moment, this solution covers three areas - personnel records, payroll and the preparation of regulated reporting.  A web portal is actively used in the work, all other communications are minimized and tied to a personal manager.  Also, all other stages of cooperation are simplified as much as possible, starting with the signing of the contract and the exit from outsourcing.  For the new service, flexible pricing is provided - 550 rubles per employee per month, which is important in the unstable economic situation.  At the same time, all responsibility for possible errors in design and calculations is transferred to us. <br><br>  At the beginning of this year, we offered our customers another solution, also built on the SaaS model - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talent_management_system">the</a> Intercomp TMS <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talent_management_system">talent management system</a> .  This is a relatively new direction in the field of personnel management for the Russian market, but, as world practice shows, it is extremely promising. <br><br>  Today Intercomp serves more than 800 customers, including many large domestic and international companies, such as Shell, Nokia Networks, Dassault Syst√®mes, Deutsche Bank, 3M and others.  At the same time, we do not focus on any particular sectors of the economy, our specialists are well aware of the specifics of more than 30 industries, including IT, banks, retail, manufacturing, and so on.  It is worth noting that many companies have been outsourcing with us for more than 15 years, and over the years cooperation with them has turned into full-fledged partnership. <br><br>  Among our partners are high-profile international organizations - leading business associations, professional clubs and chambers of commerce.  This allows you to share experience and expertise with experts from different countries and regions.  In addition, Intercomp is a local partner in Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan, <a href="http://www.intercomp.ru/about">one of the world's largest</a> business process outsourcing <a href="http://www.intercomp.ru/about">providers</a> . <br><br>  <i>Components of stable growth</i> <br><br>  The basis for the successful development of any business is qualified, loyal and well-motivated employees.  Since we are engaged in staff recruitment, we select only competent specialists in our team, paying considerable attention to the issue of their adaptation in a new place.  Subsequently, we actively promote their professional and career growth.  The company conducts a regular assessment of the work of the staff, which results in the formation of training programs (of course, taking into account the wishes of the employees and line managers themselves).  The process of forming the right team is a topic for a separate article, so over time we‚Äôll stop on it in more detail. <br><br>  Equally important is the use of optimized processes, streamlined years of practice and modern technology.  All business processes are clearly described, regulated and automated as much as possible.  As for innovation, we are constantly trying to invest in new technological platforms and infrastructure development. <br><br>  The listed factors (professional team, polished processes and newest technologies) mutually reinforce each other and create a synergistic effect.  Due to this we are in the industry unconditional authority. <br><br>  The high quality of our outsourcing services is confirmed not only by many years of successful work, but also by independent evaluations of the world's leading auditors and certification bodies, such as <a href="http://www.afnor.ru/ru/">AFNOR GROUP</a> (FRANCE) and <a href="http://kpmg.com/ru/">KPMG</a> .  The certificates and statements issued by them enable the client to be sure that our quality management system, information security and internal operational controls, are fully compliant with international standards - ISO 9001, ISO 27001, SSAE 16. <br><br>  <i>The future is in the clouds</i> <br><br>  As for the further development of outsourcing in general and business process outsourcing in particular, we consider the future to be actively using cloud technologies.  Their implementation allows to reduce the time of implementation, more quickly respond to increasing customer requests and reduce the cost of services, thereby making it more accessible for small and medium-sized businesses.  The use of online services provides a level of flexibility, scalability and convenience that cannot be achieved in the classic outsourcing model. <br><br>  Actually, this is where we end our acquaintance with Intercomp.  Thanks to everyone who mastered this topic entirely.  It may have turned out to be a bit boring, but we decided that it would be more correct to first talk about who we are and what we do.  And only then proceed to specific solutions, technologies and cases. <br><br>  We will be happy to answer any questions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/256041/">https://habr.com/ru/post/256041/</a></p>
