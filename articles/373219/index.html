  <section class="page js-page"><h1>NTR banner: a series of interviews</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This article begins a cycle of interviews with our compatriots who have achieved significant results in the field of engineering in modern Russia. <br><br>  Several years ago, fascinated by 3D printers, and then robotics, and to some extent, radio engineering, by the will of fate, was able to communicate with interesting people.  These people are somewhat reminiscent of the "generation of the sixties."  Modern engineers, of course, are not as romantic and stark as their grandfathers were. <br><br>  Life is different today.  A modern engineering person, as a rule, seems bald, wicked, and indifferent.  But behind this protective mask, forcedly worn in the brutal world of developing capitalism, there is a remarkable mind, enterprise and truly iron resistance to adversity. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  My interlocutors have manifested themselves in various branches of scientific and technological progress. <br>  What unites them all, perhaps, is a characteristic feature - these people are at the very edge of the technological vector of the modern world.  Here, obviously, the analogy between the beginning of the last century and our time is appropriate: both periods are characterized as an incredible technical breakthrough.  The technical progress of the early twentieth century, received its embodiment, understood by contemporaries, only in the Great War of 1914-18.

      Those people who in the early 1900s were carried away by motors, airplanes, electricity, were reputed to be rare eccentrics (rare ‚Äî literally here, probably around five to seven, no more than the whole globe of the then innovators), although they founded Renault, Diesel , Siemens, Sikorsky Erk. <br><br>  Our contemporaries also took up the solution of the most diverse and most complex tasks of our time.  Not all of them will become billionaires today, but even after many years, their names will take their deserved place on the banners of the progress of civilization. <br><br>  <b>Today we have a brief conversation with Konstantin Popov.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/749/7d1/04d/7497d104d45e4196872a5b9117c59efc.jpg"><br><br>  Konstantin Popov is our compatriot, innovator, entrepreneur.  At the end of 2016, he entered the <a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2016/12/07/top-innovators-for-2016">Top Intel Software Innovators of 2016</a> and ranked second in the United States. <br><br>  <b>1) Konstantin, when we talked over a cup of coffee in ‚ÄúChocolate Girl‚Äù on Taganka a couple of years ago, you just started your new project, it was about using 3D technologies for e-commerce.</b>  <b>Tell me, how did the idea arise, what was the impetus, to take up the decision to create and integrate 3D content for e-commerce?</b> <br><br>  We started working with technologies to automatically create 3D content back in 2013.  In the beginning, we studied 3D scanning for our own needs, since we developed video games and needed to produce content cheaply and quickly.  Later, R &amp; D became so enthusiastic that they decided to close the game production business and open a new company that would solve only one problem - how to make 3D quickly and cheaply.  On the other hand, we were influenced by Apple‚Äôs decision to buy PrimeSense. <br><br>  This is how Cappasity was founded.  At the same time with R &amp; D, we were looking for a niche where we could shoot the most efficiently and as a result we stopped at e-commerce. <br><br>  Now Cappasity is a cloud-based e-commerce platform that allows you to increase conversion by integrating 3D technology into business processes.  Integration involves the digitization of goods and connecting them to view in 3D and VR mode to existing online stores or websites. <br><br>  Interactive viewing of goods in 3D allows you to transmit more information to the buyer, because the buyer has the opportunity to bring closer and in detail to consider the goods being sold from any side.  Interactivity additionally delays the buyer‚Äôs attention to the product and makes it easier to remember.  In addition, this interaction mode reduces the risk of returning the goods, since the customer has a better idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat he is going to buy. <br><br>  <b>2) What is the product of your company:</b> <br><br>  We provide free software for 3D digitizing products and access to a platform for integrating 3D into online shopping sites.  So any business owner can try to create 3D for their products, upload to the cloud and embed the result on the site. <br><br>  <b>3) What are you most afraid of and what did you most desire when you started a new topic?</b> <br><br>  We didn‚Äôt have any concerns - the whole movement and stages of Cappasity growth were planned initially.  Some risks worked, but we were ready for it.  Still, before that, they had already launched a company in the USA, and therefore the second time was easier.  We had to spend about a year before we made a list of the necessary product characteristics for an advantage to enter the market.  We needed to beat the competitors in the flexibility of the solution and provide what they could not do before us. <br><br>  <b>4) What seemed the most difficult, and what was really difficult in the process?</b> <br><br>  The most difficult thing at the planning stage was to predict which technological solution would really work.  We chose between 3D cameras, a combination of 3D cameras and DSLR cameras and ordinary cameras.  As a result, the most difficult was to dwell on the simplest for users - now you can make content using a regular camera, which any store owner has. <br><br>  Initially, we set a goal to make a simple business solution, as most store owners do not have the necessary technical knowledge.  We had to make a decision where everything happens at the touch of a button.  And this was not an easy task for us. <br><br>  <b>5) How did you feel about the policy of the government of our country, in the field of innovation?</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Simply say, is it difficult to ‚Äúget through‚Äù?</b> <br><br>  We are not engaged in politics and do not work with government agencies.  I do not know what is happening in innovation and what is considered innovation.  Russia has always had its own way. <br><br>  If your market is international and you create a demanded product, then you can choose in which country you want to develop it.  So far, our government gives such an opportunity and thanks to him for that. <br><br>  <b>6) Have your views changed today, what has changed in your opinion?</b> <br><br>  Since we focus on the international market, for us in Russia nothing has changed in principle.  Is that more willing to invest in international and in particular in American companies.  And here we just provide this opportunity, as we attract private capital as well.  Therefore, the current crisis in Russia contributes to the development of business Cappasity. <br><br>  <b>7) Obviously, with the implementation of such an intensively developing project, you have gained enormous experience both as a project manager and as a manager.</b>  <b>What is the most valuable professional acquisition for you?</b> <br><br>  From the global - we have become more realistic to look at the closing cycles of transactions that are associated with the promotion of the product in the United States.  Everything else from the newly acquired experience, again connected with marketing, understanding of the e-commerce market is a fairly narrow experience, but without it, it‚Äôs impossible to sell SaaS here. <br><br>  But the most interesting thing we have ahead - the platform is just beginning its way to market. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/607/63a/68d/60763a68d34e483293d0bcedf48d4852.jpg"><br><br>  <b>8) Such a simple question: did you have to work hard?</b> <br><br>  If you do not live a startup, then nothing will take off.  I do not count the clock. <br><br>  <b>9) How, with such a busy mode of work, was your personal life?</b> <br><br>  Happily married, two daughters.  We must try to find time for everything. <br><br>  <b>10) Today, CMIITs, Technoparks, and the Robot Section are being created in our country. How do you evaluate the usefulness of such innovations? Can you compare it with foreign experience?</b> <br><br>  Unfortunately, I do not communicate much with local TSMIITami and technoparks.  I can only say that all this is not visible here (USA).  That is, the majority of active startups that could actually do something in the Valley do not sit in Russian structures, but simply work here. <br><br>  But it all depends on the product that the company makes.  Foreign accelerators and incubators are the only right place for the development of an international startup, since they have the necessary connections on the international market.  Russian structures are effective only for those who work exclusively on the Russian market. <br><br>  In this matter, many factors - from the level of mentoring / network and to geographic location. <br><br>  <b>11) In short, plans for the near future?</b> <br><br>  We have entered the market and are now starting to integrate Cappasity with the TOP-10 e-commerce sites.  This is more than 2 million active stores around the world.  So the whole year will be devoted to the growth of the client base. <br><br>  <b>12) What are your wishes for young guys - technicians, future engineers, inventors?</b> <br><br>  Immediately look at the international market.  This will allow you to set goals correctly.  And any desire can become a reality! <br><br>  <b>Konstantin, thanks for the accurate, concise answers!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/373219/">https://habr.com/ru/post/373219/</a></p>
