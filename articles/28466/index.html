      The second fact.  My previous place of work: Microtest.  How are you?  <a href="http://rdaemons.blogspot.com/2008/02/sap-bw-oltp-1.html">Meet this - SAP BW, OLTP-system (Russian Railways Project No. 1: HOW + WHY)</a> <br><br>  About the last place of work, REDLAB LTD, - in more detail.  Some time ago I had a conversation with the management about not disclosing the most blatant facts of the activities of this office, but, after some time, I thought: what the hell ?!  After all, precisely because of the silence of the deprived and offended, such little firms can continue their rather dubious activities with impunity.  When I first got a job at REDLAB, I moved from a company that had problems with paying salaries.  Therefore, I asked directly at the interview the head of the EIS department Konoplyova EF: ‚ÄúWhat about your company with the payment of salary?  Is it always on time?  Is it full? ‚ÄùI was assured that everything was in full openwork and there was absolutely nothing to worry about.  That there are delays in payments from customers, but the company wisely buffers such problems and the salary is always paid on time and in full.  It was in early <em>May</em> (note!). <br><br>  Two weeks later, a corporate meeting ensues, asking the question: ‚ÄúWhen will the debts be paid?‚Äù This question was answered by the wise leader of REDLAB Ruslan Smelyansky (who, as far as I know, is also a professor at the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics of Moscow State University, which I had the honor to finish ; about this character, apparently, it will still make sense to say a few words below).  Playing with the keys to the Audi A8 (they told me so, maybe it was not true; I could only understand that these keys were from the expensive car) and plentifully sprinkling my speech with an archaic union ‚Äúpoeliku‚Äù (it must be said, sounded quite idiotic) he said something like that, yes, as early as <em>February</em> (remember, they told me in <em>May</em> that there were no problems with salaries) there was a delay in salary, we won‚Äôt pay until then, don‚Äôt hell, we‚Äôll pay later.  Well, well, I had to wipe myself.  I was just pulled at the interview as a boy.  I have heard promises of repayment yet oh-oh-ry many times.  And with a bellowing, it is finally behind, and with the promises to pay already in a week, and with the promise that the top management will not receive a salary until the debt is paid off.  And each time it was accompanied by stroking a shiny tummy and playing with the keys of an expensive car. <br><br>  Yes, damn it with this tummy and this machine, in the end!  The problem was that at first, just no one thought that the problem would be so prolonged, and then I realized that you would never get the accumulated debt if you quit.  It turned out a vicious circle.  Therefore, when the first substantial return of debts occurred (yes! In a year and a half!), Your humble servant immediately wrote a statement.  Moreover, the debts still remained, and they did not return them to me, but I preferred to leave and say goodbye to this office forever. <br><br>  I still have warm feelings for the team with which I worked (but not to the authorities!).  All of them are to some extent hostage to REDLAB: some regional, other age, third students, and so on.  and so on  Only by using the weak position of the employees and putting them in the obviously worse conditions compared to the market, REDLAB somehow keeps afloat.  He was not helped by the transition to Compulink‚Äôs wing, nor by the violent (against the will of most of the staff) moving the office outside the Moscow Ring Road to a cheaper place. <br><br>  By the way, it's funny, but it is precisely with the problem of debts in REDLAB that the CENZURA inscriptions appear in my blog.  The fact is that when they almost swore to us on the Bible that they would pay their debts in January 2008, I believed the leadership and began to prepare materials on the Russian Railways project, in a subcontract in which I worked until that time.  God knows, nothing seditious was there, but I decided that it was better to publish all this in the end.  I must admit that my behavior is rather stupid, because the leadership, as always, did not keep its promise, and over time someone came across my blog, and I was called to the carpet.  I really risked losing the money the company owed me.  Now, of course, there is no sense in hiding anything, and the inscription -CENZURA- will soon disappear :) But here‚Äôs a lesson for everyone: leave the revelations to ‚Äúthe most sweat‚Äù when there is nothing to lose. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/28466/">https://habr.com/ru/post/28466/</a></p>
