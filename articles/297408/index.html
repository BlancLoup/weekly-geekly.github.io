      The change of the place of registration of the company led to certain tax consequences, which affected the Authors to a greater extent. <br><br>  <b>Change number 1.</b> <br>  The change was made by the Authors from US. <br>  All US Authors must send to Envato <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw9.pdf">W-9 Form</a> <br><br>  If the author does not submit the form, then from all sales through the Envato Market, the latter will hold 28% as a US Backup Withholding Tax. <br><br>  <b>Change number 2.</b> <br><br>  In connection with the change in the corporate structure, in carrying out sales by non-US Authors to American users through the Envato Market, Envato is obliged to withhold the royalty tax from payment. <br><br>  <b>To withhold tax</b> means to deduct it from the author's profit and pay instead of the author. <br><br>  <b>Summarize!</b>  Royalty tax withheld from: <br><br>  a) non-US Authors <br>  b) Who made the sale through the Envato Market <br>  c) And while the buyer was a US resident. <br><br>  Tax rates depend on the residence of the Author, and can be from 0% to 30%. <br>  You can see the rates by <a href="https://www.irs.gov/publications/p515/ar02.html">clicking on the link</a> in the right column - ‚ÄúCopyrights‚Äù <br><br>  All non-US Authors must submit to Envato <br>  individuals - <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw8ben.pdf">form W-8 BEN</a> , <br>  legal entities - <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw8bene.pdf">form W-8 BEN-E</a> . <br><br>  If the Author does not submit the form, then from all <i>{even if the buyer is not from the US}</i> sales through the Envato Market will hold 28% as a US Backup Withholding Tax. <br><br>  <b>So:</b> <br>  What will happen if the author is a resident of Ukraine and is registered as a FLP or a legal entity in Ukraine and filed a W-8 form? <br>  <i>A 10% tax on royalties will now be deducted from sales to US residents.</i> <br><br>  What will happen if the Author is a resident of the Russian Federation and is registered as an individual entrepreneur or a legal entity in the Russian Federation and filed a W-8 form? <br>  <i>The royalty tax will NOT be withheld now.</i>  <i>0% rate.</i> <br><br>  What will happen if the Author is a resident of the Republic of Belarus and is registered as an individual entrepreneur or a legal entity in the Republic of Belarus and submitted a W-8 form? <br>  <i>A 0% tax on royalties will now be charged on sales to US residents.</i> <br><br>  What to do if the Author wants to use the company outside of his country? <br><br>  <b>The most optimal</b> way to work with Envato since January 1, 2016 is to register a company in Cyprus. <br>  Currently, Cyprus legislation allows you to make an effective income tax rate of 2.5% (and less) using the IP BOX, which we will discuss in another article. <br>  At the same time, most of the profits from Cyprus will flow to an offshore company, which can be considered as an additional plus. <br><br>  <b>A good tool, right ?!</b> <br><br>  But it is worth noting that now <a href="http://www.oecd.org/">OECD is</a> trying to change the legislation of Cyprus regarding IP BOX, royalties and tax burden may be above 2.5%. <br><br>  UPDT: it is rumored that those who used such a structure in Cyprus before June 2016 will be able to use it for another 5 years (but these are only rumors) <br><br>  At the moment it is not known <a href="http://www.oecd.org/ctp/beps.htm">whether the BEPS</a> plan will enter into force, and whether it will enter at all! <br><br>  But, in order to apply a zero tax rate on royalties, your company must be a resident with a Cyprus Tax ID. <br><br>  Contact <a href="http://law-boot.com/en">LAWBOOT Lawyers &amp; Consultants</a> and we will be happy to help you get such a tool! <br><br>  We always ‚Äúhold our nose to the wind‚Äù in matters related to jurisprudence in the field of IT. <br><br>  <b>For wordpress developers, we have a special offer!</b> <a href=""><br></a>  <a href="">Email us</a> for details. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/988/28a/bbd/98828abbda1e4838b42afea501b39673.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297408/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297408/</a></p>
