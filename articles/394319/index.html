Conventional alarms are triggered only by clearly tuned sensors, and only indoors.  And that, provided that the owner set the object on protection (those who we are trying to protect are aware of, too). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/918/d31/88b/918d3188b3604488b87f78c134c99bf0.jpg"><br><br>  And if you went out for a smoke - and you by teme?  Or the child walks in the yard - and strangers offend him?  Yes, even the car at the house can not be put on the console guard, it is necessary to follow everything personally!

You can order any service from substitution of captcha for automatic systems for resetting messages to the forums to monitoring the performance of your washing machine.  Well, the washing machines themselves know a lot of things, but the console protection of property today is still far from perfect.  As part of the downsizing, the police sequestered the Private Security, now it almost does not work with the private and commercial sectors.  Chop s have little right, and they leave only for a clear threat - the sensor triggered in advance of the armed system.  A whole sector of security services, on which you will not install sensors with alarms, is now available on the Internet. <br><br>  Honestly, I was asked to write this article.  At first, I had been butting with this company for a long time due to the difficulty of connecting a cheap IP camera, which I already had.  ‚ÄúTake the normal‚Äù in the sense of the ‚Äúmore expensive‚Äù did not suit me - for some kind of Internet service only.  Cheap refused to work through services that provide direct access without a "white" IP.  Then it turned out that I don‚Äôt have a ‚Äúgray‚Äù IP, the provider doesn‚Äôt give anything at all, these are such high-tech technologies.  But two months later, the "concierge" themselves connected and without any IP. <br><br>  When I had already forgotten why I was going to do this, an unexpected problem brought me back to IP-concierg.com.  To sit with a sick father, I needed a nurse, and my mother was afraid to let in strangers, asked me to sit down - every time she needed to go to the store or go to the country house.  Then I put the cheapest IP camera, brought it to my phone - in full confidence that I can watch the process all the time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/be7/940/04e/be794004e4cf4695895f23e48f022c68.jpg"><br><br>  For a long time I did not have enough, such video surveillance is only one name that is mobile;  You will not keep the phone in front of your eyes all the time, and the Internet is not always good.  Total ‚Äúthousand‚Äù rubles per month - and around the clock, other people watching your camera via the Internet are watching.  Living creatures with real human intelligence monitor everything that happens in the house, including the nurse.  You set a task for them, what to pay attention to - and they report to you in all respects. <br><br>  Entering into the taste, I put a couple of cameras, one - at the entrance from the hallway.  A week later, they called me from <a href="http://ip-concierge.com/">Ipikonszhera</a> - they reported that some insane went into the apartment and communicates with the hostess.  Immediately I call my parents back - under the pretext of checking the meter, pinned the ‚Äúseller of things‚Äù.  I turn the car over to the house and explain to my mom at the same time so that she immediately announces to the guest that his arrival is being recorded, well, and a bunch of other useful phrases.  In general, such visitors were divorced by the Nemer, they spud old people in every way. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/525/e6f/43d/525e6f43d3b44f0380afd72327f9ab36.jpg"><br><br>  Now I have sent the Internet Concierge photos of those who are allowed to enter my parents' apartment, so that they immediately report the arrival of strangers.  My old people will not be able to give a decent answer to such citizens, especially since they will definitely open the door, I know.  But the operator can now call not only me, but also familiar neighbors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c5b/c31/ffe/c5bc31ffe9f546fea78393bd5b586029.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, not just a call or SMS comes to the mobile phone, but a video of the event that the Concierge thought was dangerous.  What is very informative, then I myself make a decision.  But I don‚Äôt jump to the phone every hour now - I don‚Äôt ask if there was any other evil person who came?  For the sake of fairness, I must say, more has not yet come, perhaps the very look of the half-hidden camera, though annoying.  By the way, Ipikonsier is also responsible for her safety.  Virtually, of course, but let's hopefully, effectively.  When video is lost, a video of what was recorded a few minutes before the signal disappears is sent to my phone. <br><br>  Naturally, no one will come if something happens to be serious, but at least I myself can react, at least, to call the police and / or ambulance.  Now there is an opportunity to receive an informative signal in time.  You can configure his danger level in your personal account ‚Äî report all suspicious cases or only overt obvious ones, such as masked people and pistols.  This is not a joke, after a few months I made an alert for the camera in the stairwell - ‚Äúonly when attempting to enter‚Äù.  Just inadequate rummaging around the entrances insanely a lot, a month came a couple of video messages: some nasty muzzles inspect the door and locks.  Or it seems to me already. <br><br>  Another 1,200 rubles - and I no longer parked my car.  Of course, at an apartment building you will not always find a place under your own camera, which I stuck out of the window, but even a cheap two-megapixel is enough to cover a wide area, and if anything, you can tuck it.  The concierge on the Internet now also monitors the car around the clock.  My personal invention is to not loudly signal the movement through the division through the video detection did not roll, because  It works on animals and children playing around cars.  And a living person, albeit a distant one, is able to distinguish where the pigeons are, and where the real "it" is. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a56/7ed/a56/a567eda568dc4fc49fd9f008086d48f4.jpg"><br><br>  I sent the photos, as those who are allowed to sit down and even touch my ‚Äúhorse‚Äù look, and now I sleep peacefully, even after threatening my neighbor to put millet on the hood - the struggle for the parking space in the yard is only heating up all the time.  And the situation with the theft of wheelbarrows, they say, is tense - there are more hijackings, apparently, the parts have risen in price with an increase in the baxometer. <br><br>  I must say the truth, in a month I was tired of moving the camera, in our yard it was thick - it was empty, you could not guess with a place for parking, and I put a wide view on which you would not see people.  But I am still recognized by conventional signals that only I know, I hope. <br><br>  Well, the final chord, after which I penetrated to the outsourcing and agreed to write such an article (according to an unobtrusive statement of the operator, like put it on), this is a technical solution in the country house of his boss.  I myself know almost everything in safety, but here no technological tricks and obstinacy helped.  Sobsna, it is often the case when a person wants to protect the street area at his home in a cottage settlement.  But how, on what technologies?  Perimeter sensors do not roll - there are constantly running small animals such as cats, and packs.  Video cameras are even more so - there are trees and bushes around here, which block the video detector with alarms ... And the task is ordinary - at least to ensure the safety of walking children.  Put a three-shift guard with a booth?  This is no longer life. <br><br>  And now we are preparing cameras that will cover the entire perimeter, and only the perimeter, so as not to interfere with personal life.  Bushes and living creatures are no longer a problem, to distinguish interference, the Concierge has a real intellect - a humane.  Well, oddly enough, the chief asked to equip and play area to control the nurse. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/041/4ae/26f/0414ae26f9c34b329932ad5bae87ef03.jpg"><br><br>  You can‚Äôt take anyone or anything out of the village right away, you should have enough time to react if there is a quick alert.  Everything can have time to return in the ass, as they say in the bodies, hot on the trail. <br><br>  While writing this article, I found people to have an acquaintance client at a convenience store.  And it turned out like this.  My wife accidentally dropped an expensive item in this place, at 2000 re.  She was offered to pay or wait for the police.  When I came, the sellers hinted to me that we would agree on 500 re, but there is a problem - the new guard, for the time being, everyone is afraid of him.  I'm coming up to it, like what are you laying here?  The man was so embarrassed that almost in tears he began to assure everyone that he was his boyfriend.  Of course, I saved 1,500 re, but, damn, what kind of protection?  And, as it turned out, the shop belongs to my good friend.  Personally, I was not ashamed to lay all, although I earned.  I feel sorry for entrepreneurs more. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/df8/305/63c/df830563c775413ea96f8eedec7ab6d2.jpg"><br><br>  In our close collectives there are security guards and personnel, and buyers are often at the same time.  If the owner is determined to watch all this all night himself, this is an owl.  And, if the lark, then with IP-concierges do not agree, they are oh, very far!  Without phone and without address.  Another friend's family business collapsed due to the silent misunderstanding of who and how much has the right to use the cash register.  So you will think who is better to entrust the guards: to their loved ones or to distant strangers? <br><br>  Sergey Kostylin (Izhevsk) <br><br>  PS: In the discussion of the previous articles, we were asked many times to write in more detail what the ‚Äú <a href="http://ip-concierge.com/">Ipikonsier</a> ‚Äù service is.  The site explains its services from the point of view of professionals, perhaps, therefore, it does not seem completely clear.  We decided to present the information on behalf of the client.  Sorry for not using public style and some idioms! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/394319/">https://habr.com/ru/post/394319/</a></p>
