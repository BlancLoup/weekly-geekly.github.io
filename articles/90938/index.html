  <section class="page js-page"><h1>IT on guard of the law</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I suggest you express an opinion, or even better, to take part in a brainstorming session on the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa software project for law enforcement agencies in Russia. <br>  A few years ago I worked in the investigation.  For convenience, many of us used different programs that automatically generated different forms, all that remained was to type text.  What did it give us?  A small saving of time and effort - no more.  The presented project has a slightly different purpose: to give clues on a crime, to reveal various patterns, to give ‚Äúfood for thought‚Äù to the investigator and the investigator, i.e.  to help precisely in <u>solving the</u> crime, and not in record keeping.  Interesting?  Then I ask under the cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Preamble</b>  If desired, this part can be skipped. <br><br>  One of the main problems in the investigation and operational-search activity is the ‚Äúconveyor‚Äù, the monotony of labor.  Consider the example of a typical burglary.  Dozens, if not hundreds of burglaries, are committed every day, almost all of them resemble one another like twin brothers: a lock was broken, things were scattered around the apartment, valuable property was stolen, neighbors did not see anything, heard nothing, and the victims did not suspect anyone.  As a result, there are no clues, it is impossible to solve the crime without delay, the verification materials, which have not yet become a criminal case, fall into the category of ‚Äúgrouse‚Äù.  With a 99% probability, it can be argued that all actions in this criminal case will be reduced to questioning the victim and paperwork: write a sample commission to the opera and get the same sample response.  Naturally, there will be no operational search activities: there are no leads, there is no motivation for the work of the operatives.

      <br>
      <b>Practical part</b> <br><br>  Without further ado, I immediately show the layout of the program interface (I‚Äôm not a designer, so don‚Äôt blame me): <br><br> <a href=""><img src="http://img406.imageshack.us/img406/3560/48448794.th.jpg" alt="Interface"></a> <br><br>  As you can see, the main element of the program is Yandex.Maps.  It is assumed that we have a certain database that contains materials of criminal cases, as well as various results of operational investigative activities.  The main elements of the database are: <br><ul><li>  <b>events</b> are actually crimes or other facts that are time bound; </li><li>  <b>Places or points</b> are the places where crimes were committed, and places that are important for operatives (well-known points of sale of stolen goods, drug dealers, etc.); </li><li>  <b>individuals</b> - criminals (ie, their place of residence, temporary stay on the map) and other individuals. </li></ul><br><br>  The database is centralized - either at the level of a separate territorial unit, or at the city level. <br>  Having entered the data of the next crime, we immediately visually see important elements (similar crimes committed earlier in the area, the circle of potential suspects, possible locations of the stolen property), having not only geographic, but also time bound (promptly, we absolutely do not need similar crimes committed a year, two, three back).  For example, I made the following tags on the map: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/447/510/24f447510d93df0b7119b49096261ef4.png" alt="Event">  - crime (i.e. an element of the category "event").  The level of transparency of the label may indicate, for example, the age of the event (the more time has passed since the crime was committed, the more transparent the label) or the level of similarity with the current crime (if the crime previously committed has many similar tags to the crime being considered). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/837/899/e96/837899e96e717fe4efee1707af55eb09.png" alt="A place">  - place, point, i.e.  some object that is important when dealing with crimes of this category (for example, a pawnshop when stealing, on the other hand, we absolutely do not need the same pawnshop when investigating a murder, respectively, in the second case it does not appear). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/57c/cee/b8f/57cceeb8f41ac4921420e8c19e1586d3.png" alt="Persons">  - Persons, for example, previously convicted for the commission of similar crimes, conditionally convicted, registered, etc. <br><br>  To set the time interval, the graph under the map can be used - by changing the period, we, accordingly, hide or add new elements on the map. <br>  For crimes, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãtags is also actively used: from the event, its characteristic features are highlighted (for example, penetration into a dwelling by selecting a key), by which elements from the database can be filtered out (for example, they can be displayed on a map of burglaries last month). <br><br>  When you click on the label, a similar type of information window pops up (a <i>balun</i> , if you speak in Yandex.Maps "language"): <br><br><img src="http://img576.imageshack.us/img576/6641/baloon.jpg" alt="Balun"><br><br>  in which we can quickly see the most important elements, such as the method of committing a crime, photos from the crime scene, etc.  If necessary, by clicking on the appropriate link, we can move to the interrogation protocol (or any other protocol) of the criminal case. <br><br>  Toolbar: <br><br><img src="http://img51.imageshack.us/img51/8503/panelv.jpg" alt="Toolbar"><br><br>  contains on / off buttons for displaying the corresponding categories of elements (after the drag-and-drop tool from left to right, respectively: persons, crimes, places).  Do not look at the "quality" of the icons - I took the first ones that came from the Internet. <br><br>  As I wrote above, besides dividing the elements into three categories (individuals, events and places), they are also tied to certain categories of crimes: the places of sale of the stolen property are only relevant for crimes involving the theft of property, etc.  This is done so as not to burden the operative with redundant, unnecessary information. <br><br>  <b>Summary</b>  I suggest everyone to express an opinion about the idea, suggest improvements, criticize, etc.  If you get enough enthusiasts, then ready to take an active part in creating the project.  In particular, on the program part (web programming), on the part of new ideas, contacting with the Ministry of Internal Affairs for joint discussion of the project.  I do not pursue any commercial interests in this, I believe that such software should be developed free of charge (for good). <br><br>  <b>PS:</b> tell me which blog to place the topic? <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> moved to the "collective mind." </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/90938/">https://habr.com/ru/post/90938/</a></p>
