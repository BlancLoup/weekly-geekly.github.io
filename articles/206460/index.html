Here are some basic tips: <br><ul><li>  Start with the most difficult task. </li><li>  Take the first step - it will be easier to continue </li><li>  Make a plan and follow it strictly </li><li>  Do what you love </li><li>  Do not be distructed </li></ul><br>  It's simple.  <b>Close Habr and get to work!</b> <br><br>  But for some reason all these tips don't work on me.  Like the right things people say, but - does not work.  By the way, there are also articles on the topic ‚ÄúWhy can't I force myself to work?‚Äù  They describe the problem from the point of view of psychology and offer solutions like ‚Äúget rid of internal contradictions and the fear of failure.‚Äù  Probably, if you do this, everything will work out, but where can you find this magic button ‚ÄúGet rid of ...‚Äù? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Before you start solving a problem, you need to <b>understand its causes</b> .  This we now do.  I will say right away that I cannot offer any general recipe, since everyone will have his own reasons for the problem.  I will demonstrate only the method of its solution. <br><br>  In my opinion, the problem considered in this article can be divided into two: <br><ol><li>  I do not want to engage in a specific task </li><li>  I don't want to work at all </li></ol><br>  At the same time, the state ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to work at all‚Äù often arises because there are too many tasks that I don‚Äôt want to do.  There are other options - I do not like the work itself or just get tired - but everything seems to be clear here: change your job or sleep well.  Therefore, in the further reasoning, we will assume that the work in general is pleasant, the state of health is normal, and it is impossible to work precisely because of some ‚Äúwrong‚Äù tasks.

      To begin with, we will make a list of tasks that need to be done right now, but instead I write an article, read Habr, watch a video, communicate with friends, play, drink coffee or smoke (underline).  Have made?  Good.  Now for each task we ask ourselves the question ‚ÄúWhy don't I do it?‚Äù The answers in the style ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want / can‚Äôt‚Äù are complemented by ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want / can‚Äôt, <i>because</i> ...‚Äù.  If at the same time it is possible to realize some general reasons for not doing all the tasks recorded, we fix them too.  The result will be a list of significant problems for you, leading to shirking work.  I got this: <br><ol><li>  The task is <b>too simple</b> .  In the mind, it is thought out in a matter of seconds and is already perceived as resolved, so that it becomes in fact not interesting at all to do it after that. </li><li>  The task is <b>too complicated</b> .  It would seem that this paragraph contradicts the previous one, but if we describe in more detail, it becomes clear that there is no contradiction.  I don‚Äôt like the same type of problems with the previously known solution algorithm - I need a space for creativity.  However, if the task is so out of the usual framework that I can‚Äôt even imagine which side to approach it from, then it kills any desire to experiment. </li><li>  The task is <b>important, but not urgent</b> , therefore all the time it is postponed by others - not so important, but more urgent.  In this case, as a rule, they recommend delegating all these unimportant tasks to an employee for whom they will be important enough - but what if there is no one to delegate? </li><li>  The solution of the problem <b>can</b> obviously <b>be automated</b> , but now it <b>has to be done manually</b> .  This situation arises when you do what you have already done the second, fifth or tenth time, you see the pattern and you understand that it can be easily programmed so that everything can be done by itself.  At the same time, I do not want to rush to program right now either, because see clause 1. </li><li>  To solve the problem requires <b>access to the real world</b> with all the ensuing consequences.  For example, send the client the original documents by Russian Post.  This and the previous point, perhaps, are the result of the professional deformation of an IT specialist, but the fact remains that such problems interfere with the solution of some problems, and this must somehow be addressed. </li><li>  <b>No external stimulus.</b>  There are no clear deadlines.  Or there is, but there are still a few days before the deadline, and working there for five minutes - at least, it seems so now.  No one needs to report on the performance of the task, because the boss trusts you and everyone doesn‚Äôt keep track of, or in general you are your own boss. </li><li>  You <b>need to immerse yourself</b> in a task <b>completely and for a long time</b> - I am afraid that I can get carried away and lose control over other current tasks. </li><li>  The task is <b>contrary to internal beliefs</b> .  For example, I find it difficult to remind people that they owe me something, but I have to do it periodically. </li><li>  <b>I briefly switch</b> to reading mail or various useful articles on Habr√© - and for a whole hour the work gets up. </li><li>  <b>There are too many tasks</b> .  It‚Äôs impossible to single out one or two of the most important and urgent ones.  There is a feeling of ‚Äústill not having time for anything‚Äù and automatic switching to a more pleasant pastime. </li></ol><br>  Here, as many as 10 reasons have been identified.  You can continue this exciting activity and find 10 more pieces, smaller, but let's better deal with these.  Let's go the same way on points. <br><ol><li>  Once such an impressive list of problems has been drawn up, it becomes clear that <b>too simple</b> tasks are simply a gift.  They are solved quickly and easily - it is possible that you will spend less time on solving several such problems than on reading this article and compiling your list.  And now it‚Äôs also easy to find interest in them - since we began to rake up the debris of accumulated cases, it means that we want the number of tasks hanging over us to be reduced, and with small steps it is easier to do.  By the way, the problem number 10 as a result will not be so acute. </li><li>  With <b>too complex</b> tasks will be more difficult.  The main thing here is to understand that if there is a task, then it will have to be solved anyway anyway (it is unlikely that it will resolve itself).  Therefore, we must close our eyes and take the first step (somewhere we have already been advised to do this, yes).  Take a simple example.  It is necessary to make a presentation for a speech at the conference, but there is no such experience.  I think there are thoughts in my head (the topic is well known, otherwise we would not be assigned to speak), but it‚Äôs unclear how to make a presentation.  You can sit and feel sorry for yourself.  And you can open PowerPoint and make the first slide - with the topic and the name of the speaker.  And at the end to make a slide, ‚ÄúThank you for your attention,‚Äù with contact information.  Here, already something.  At this stage, the main thing is not to get involved in the elaboration of details - selection of fonts, etc. - because you need to move on.  And then we begin to think about what we are going to talk about - and for each thesis we make a separate slide with a title.  Then it will become clear that somewhere need pictures, charts, animation ... As a result, you will not notice how the presentation will be ready.  Of course, you can argue that there is nothing difficult in making a presentation, but &lt;my task&gt; is really complicated.  Nevertheless, try this approach - surely the matter will get off the ground, and there it will be a shame not to finish it to the end. </li><li>  We turn to <b>an important, but not urgent</b> task.  To begin with, we will determine why it is, in fact, important.  Perhaps some tasks only <i>seem</i> important, and at this stage they will be safely eliminated - i.e.  it will become clear that they can not be postponed permanently, but completely canceled.  This really happens.  If, nevertheless, the task turned out to be important, then it is necessary to understand what its successful completion will affect.  You may be able to release a new version of the product and your users will be happy.  Or you can do another task - interesting and enjoyable.  This in itself stimulates an end to the fact that it hinders such a bright future, plus some deadlines may appear - for example, a new version is planned to be released before the new year, which means the task has a quite visible time. </li><li>  In the case when the <b>task that can be automated, you have to perform manually</b> , I think it remains only to come to terms with the imperfections of the world - not everything always turns out the way you want.  You need to do this task manually.  And then another one the same.  And when it becomes unbearable to endure, then still take it and automate it.  That's all. </li><li>  <b>Going to the real world</b> is actually even beneficial.  After that, it becomes clear that these tasks are not so difficult in paragraph 2. You can take this as an additional motivation to solve habitual tasks. </li><li>  If the task has <b>no external stimulus</b> , you can invent it yourself.  Come up with a challenge for yourself.  For example, tell colleagues that you are ready to do this very task in N hours (the deadline should be real, but not allowing laziness).  And go! </li><li>  If you have already dealt with all the previous tasks, then there is nothing to worry about <b>plunging completely</b> into some task.  Give yourself up to an interesting exciting business - you deserve it. </li><li>  Change beliefs for the sake of one task that <b>contradicts</b> them is certainly not worth it.  But courageously solve it and be proud that overcame this complexity - why not an option?  However, there is a more subtle approach to the question - if the contradiction is very strong or there are many such problems, then perhaps it is better not to break yourself, but to think about changing the type of activity. </li><li> <b>For a short time, switching is</b> not only possible but necessary.  But it is better to switch to something noticeable to the authorities - for example, drink tea or go <s>out for a</s> walk.  First, you will have a better rest, and second, the same external stimulus is added - you are unlikely to drink tea for an hour. </li><li>  <b>Too many tasks?</b>  <b>No longer!</b>  Moving in small steps, by this time you have already solved most of the problems, so that the latter will disappear by itself. </li></ol><br>  Something like that.  Successes in work and with the coming! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/206460/">https://habr.com/ru/post/206460/</a></p>
