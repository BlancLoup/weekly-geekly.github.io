Having worked for several years in the support team, I cannot but appreciate the work of my colleagues from other companies.  ‚ÄúPlease clean the cache.  Also on the link you will find the FAQ, which contains many answers to your questions "- no, friends, so we will not help anyone.  A good support agent should answer questions as if the fate of the whole Universe depends on his answer.  I will tell a few stories that happened to me in real life, and I will try to show how the real Lord Lord should behave in these situations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ed7/04e/a74/ed704ea743534e828748081eabd6a61c.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Story One: Speed</b> <br>  After updating the operating system on the phone, some games stopped working.  Since one of them was really good, I tried to start it in all possible ways.  And, of course, the first thing she wrote in support.  There was no answer, so I tried the only available method: I deleted the game and installed it again.  After 14 hours, the answer came from the support: ‚ÄúWe are working on solving this problem.  If you do not delete the game, then the progress will be saved in the new version. "  Very timely. <br><br>  If there is no time machine in your storage room, you must answer the user's question right away, discarding all distractions.  For some reason did not answer in time?  Sorry, clarify whether this problem is still relevant.  Even if the issue has already been resolved, explain the reasons for this situation, tell us how to avoid this in the future.

      <b>History Two: Knowledge</b> <br>  In one of the online stores of printing materials, a support specialist recommended me excellent ink.  True, they were not suitable for my printer.  But the man tried! <br><br>  There can be nothing worse than a support agent, whose knowledge does not exceed the user's knowledge level.  How are you going to save the world?  All support staff must be damn smart if not brilliant!  After all, it is impossible to help someone if you do not know your own product. <br><br>  <b>History Three: Visualization</b> <br>  <i>- How to change the nickname in the game?</i>  <i>He reminds me of the former, because of this I stopped enjoying the game.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- You can change the nickname in the settings.</i>  <i>Click on the desired tab, then - "General Information", then select "Personal Information" ...</i> <br><br>  Blah blah blah.  The problem is that for a specialist, some things become obvious.  He pressed the button so many times that it was hard for him to imagine how to get confused in this situation.  And for the player, the word ‚Äútab‚Äù itself is a challenge worthy of the Google search string. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ac2/587/cb9/ac2587cb965144d9aad1d0f1f4ceb3bf.jpg"><br><br>  Attach screenshots to your answer, if possible - send a video instruction.  Explain everything as simple as possible, avoid complex terms.  Arm yourself with the phrase ‚ÄúThis is a feature of the game (product)‚Äù.  I realized a long time ago that in especially neglected cases such an explanation works flawlessly.  By following these simple rules, the support agent will be able to quickly convey his thoughts to the user. <br><br>  <b>Fourth Story: Adventure Time</b> <br>  I hardly can now count how many times my friends called me and asked what Firebug is.  For them, this is the magical mystery of the installation of the browser with the name Mazila, which is unpleasant for the ear, and the quest to catch the fire bug.  It is normal to ask the user for help in solving his own problem, but this should be done correctly. <br><br>  Write down in all the details of the actions that a person must perform, be sure to attach screenshots and a video tutorial.  The user will be happy to help: ‚ÄúWow!  They deal with my problem, and I can participate in this!  Here are 10 screenshots, here's a photo of my daughter, and this is me and my mother, and this is Firebug. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Fifth story: participation</b> <br>  Even if the support agent could help, it‚Äôs a shame to see the Question Closed before you could thank the specialist for participating. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1d7/1f9/86c/1d71f986c6aa460d9d5183a67775d05a.jpg"><br><br>  Be with the user to the end.  To ask for help is a stress for everyone; it is a fear to seem stupid, a fear to meet a housing department employee on the other side of the screen, and not a trained support agent.  When a person is given a good, comprehensive answer, he is genuinely pleased.  Give him the opportunity to express gratitude, wishes, or to share his joy. <br><br>  Over time, a good support service agent develops his own unique style of answers, his own special charm, and his own chips that players will like.  But never forget: people trust you.  Do not let them down. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/362597/">https://habr.com/ru/post/362597/</a></p>
