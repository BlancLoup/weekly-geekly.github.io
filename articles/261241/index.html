  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Read more about 3D navigation in nanoCAD Plus 7</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In nanoCAD Plus 7, which <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/nanosoft/blog/258193/">was released on May 18, 2015</a> , a number of functions have appeared, significantly expanding the scope and positioning of the nanoCAD platform.  We offer our readers a number of technical articles in which we dive into these functions in more detail, consider ‚Äúwhat opportunities they have‚Äù and ‚Äúhow they can be put into practice‚Äù.  This article focuses on the "Perspective Navigation" feature. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/151/d19/6c9/151d196c9ed14d488fb86093e7b522f4.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Introduction </h4>  Why is this interesting?  The fact is that navigation in three-dimensional space is very important for analyzing 3D models, which can be obtained in completely different software products, but assembled in a single DWG model. <br><br>  The subtlety is that AutoCAD allows you to conveniently look at the model only in the Parallel (orthogonal) projection mode, i.e.  the model lies in your palm, and you examine it from all sides - the commands of the Free and Dependent orbits are responsible for this.  This is an ample mode for visualization of engineering parts, but it is completely inconvenient to work with architectural and construction objects when you need to feel yourself inside the model.  Yes, in AutoCAD, you can put a camera, move it along the way, but these are all very complicated from the user's point of view modes that almost nobody uses. <br><br>  That is why we set the task for the developers of the nanoCAD platform to implement convenient navigation in three-dimensional space in the Perspective projection mode ala DOOM. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">About perspective and orthogonal projection</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  On the Internet you can find a <a href="https://www.google.ru/webhp%3Fsourceid%3Dchrome-instant%26rlz%3D1C1CHFX_ruRU646RU646%26ion%3D1%26espv%3D2%26es_th%3D1%26ie%3DUTF-8">huge number of interesting articles</a> explaining the difference between Perspective and Parallel (orthogonal) projections.

    <h4>  Model preparation </h4>  What data does navigation in 3D work with?  C any.  Anything that is saved in the DWG format, modeled in the nanoCAD environment, or imported into the DWG format, will be displayed in the nanoCAD Plus 3D space.  And then this model will be like. <br><br>  This means that this function will be of interest both to applications under nanoCAD (which can use it to understand and analyze the model in the design process), and for those professionals who assemble three-dimensional models in the nanoCAD environment through external links.  There is a unique opportunity to integrate the models of disparate solutions into one whole and carry out a visual analysis of the model.  For example, you can create a three-dimensional model in ArchiCAD, then perform a design part in Revit, ventilate in MagiCAD, and electrics, water and heating in nanoCAD Electro, VC, Heating solutions, and then unload the models from these solutions in the DWG format and display them as a single unit in the nanoCAD Plus 7 platform. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f79/912/aff/f79912aff66b4e929ff6951ee7a19b71.jpg"><br>  <i>Fig.</i>  <i>2. A model assembled from ArchiCAD, nanoCAD Electro, SCS, OPS, VC and Heating is displayed in the nanoCAD Plus environment.</i> <br><br>  Also, this function will be useful when working with clouds of points, which are full-fledged three-dimensional objects in nanoCAD.  Imagine that you can walk on a virtual model in 10 minutes after the 3D scanner has processed the object?  This is fantastic! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d24/e3c/98e/d24e3c98e50645a59b5d783c4292555e.png"><br>  <i>Fig.</i>  <i>3. Navigating the three-dimensional model obtained from the 3D scanner.</i> <br><br><h4>  Navigation in nanoCAD Plus 7 </h4>  If you <a href="http://nanocad7.ru/download-nanocad-7-plus">have nanoCAD Plus installed</a> , then open the sample file in the program from the Samples \ Clouds of dots folder - let's use it to practically explore the navigation options in nanoCAD: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/408/52f/95b/40852f95b3224e62a4eb420c8f2695ee.png"><br>  <i>Fig.</i>  <i>4. Navigating the three-dimensional model obtained from the 3D scanner.</i> <br><br>  Navigation is carried out by two methods: by means of the ‚ÄúWalk‚Äù command (3DWALK, 3D WALK) or by the ‚ÄúFly‚Äù command (3DFLY, 3D WIGHT).  Both of these commands are located in the Views and Projections panel or in the View \ Circuit and Circle menu.  The difference between the teams lies in the "freedom" of navigation: during a walk, you move in one plane, while flying around, freely hover over the entire model. <br><br>  When a command is launched, the way the model is projected on the screen changes (so there is a slight distortion), and the cursor turns into a green cross, aimed at the center of the screen (see Fig. 3).  Try now to move the mouse - the image on the screen will begin to move.  In fact, the mouse now controls your gaze - up, down, left-right.  Look around - you are immersed in the nanoCAD environment!  :-) <br><br>  Now try to press the "W" key or the forward arrow and hold it.  You will start moving forward and, if you hold the button for a long time, sooner or later you will enter the model!  Backward movement - key "S" or down arrow.  There is also the possibility to move left and right - these are the keys ‚ÄúA‚Äù and ‚ÄúD‚Äù, respectively.  Moreover, all these keys can be pressed and held in combinations and thus go forward and at the same time slightly to the side.  As a result, you have the full opportunity to control the movement on the three-dimensional model of nanoCAD - left-right-forward-back and the mouse indicates where you look! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b29/f49/14e/b29f4914e92a4f72a934c568fc690601.png"><br>  <i>Fig.</i>  <i>5. Using nanoCAD navigation, you can climb into the most inaccessible parts of the model - for example, behind a false ceiling, to see how communications are placed in a confined space.</i> <br><br>  There is also the ‚ÄúSHIFT‚Äù key, which includes temporary acceleration, the ‚Äú+‚Äù and ‚Äú-‚Äù keys, which respectively increase and decrease the displacement step.  Welcome to the world of three-dimensional navigation nanoCAD!  :-) <br><br><h4>  The advantages of 3D navigation in nanoCAD </h4><ol><li>  <b>Simple and convenient</b> .  If you have ever played shooters like DOOM, then you can easily get comfortable in the nanoCAD environment.  If you are far from the games, then after reading this article, I think you will feel quite free inside the nanoCAD model. </li><li>  <b>Helpful</b>  At any time you can look into the remote part of the project, see how one dock with another, understand how much space is left between objects, analyze the intersection of objects with each other.  A great tool for analyzing your projects. </li><li>  <b>Comprehensively</b> .  nanoCAD can collect various data in one project - point clouds, solid-state (solid) and surface (mesh) models, models of any CAD systems compatible with the DWG format (vertical applications Nanosoft, AutoCAD Architectural, Civil, Revit, Tekla, ArchiCAD and others).  Most importantly, save the 3D model in DWG format. </li><li>  <b>Fast</b> .  The processing speed of three-dimensional data in nanoCAD is quite high.  This allows you to open large assemblies inside the product and navigate through it.  But, of course, everything must be within reason. </li><li>  <b>Inexpensive</b> .  Using nanoCAD as a tool for integrating disparate models into one, you can build an inexpensive workplace for analyzing a three-dimensional project. </li></ol><br><h4>  3D navigation features in nanoCAD </h4><ol><li>  <b>Demanding of resources</b> .  Three-dimensional navigation is not the easiest tool; it can load the resources of any modern machine.  The more complex models you drag into the volume, the more productive the system you need to have.  Therefore, approach the process wisely, limiting the data so as to successfully solve your problem. </li><li>  <b>Work with multi-scale models</b> .  Since  Since nanoCAD is not tied to dimensional units and can work with completely different models in scale, it becomes difficult to estimate the dimension of the model and adjust the default settings.  There are several difficult situations for the user: <ul><li>  The "W" and "S" keys do not move around the model.  In this case, check the step of movement - most likely it is so small that you just do not notice the movement.  Use the "+" and "-" keys to change the movement step. </li><li>  When you move the model is cut at some distance in front of you.  Cancel the command and return to the regular nanoCAD mode, use the mouse wheel to bring the model closer and again switch to perspective mode - nanoCAD will reduce the cropping area to a more acceptable level. </li></ul></li><li>  <b>There is no possibility to edit the model in perspective mode</b> - this is one of the current limitations of nanoCAD and we have much to develop. </li></ol><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4>  We really hope that the functionality of navigation in three-dimensional space in the perspective mode will appeal to designers and users of nanoCAD - not many CAD systems can boast such functionality at the moment, and among AutoCAD-like systems, such visualization of projects is unique.  Therefore, in our opinion, the tool was very useful. <br><br>  We count on feedback and good projects for you. <br><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/dows/" class="user_link">dows</a> aka Denis Ozhigin </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/261241/">https://habr.com/ru/post/261241/</a></p>
