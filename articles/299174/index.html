Raising the price of a click, interrupting the leaders' stakes means quickly reaching the limit when contextual advertising becomes simply unprofitable.  The cost of attracting customers is more than net income.  And the budget is not rubber. <br><br>  And if the business needs more customers?  The usual scheme is to increase advertising costs.  More money - more applications.  Again, everything depends on the budget)

      In this case you will learn how to invest less in advertising and get more return.  On the example of a transport company that has set the task to load a fleet of 100%.  The name and address of the site is not disclosed under the terms of confidentiality.  In this case, you will see a detailed scheme of action. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Initial data</b> <br><br>  Trucking company, one of the market leaders in its region.  Carry goods in Russia + Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan.  An advertising campaign has been launched in 32 regions.  In each of them, there are 7-10 advertisers who compete for 30-40 high-frequency requests, which is why the price of a click on ‚ÄúZadran‚Äù is incredible. <br><br>  An example of one of the regions: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/edb/bed/cdf/edbbedcdf8d946f8801322df81bf4c5f.jpg"><br><br>  As you can see, the rate for "high frequency" starts from 200 rubles.  ($ 6.5) and exceeds 1,470 rubles.  upon request ‚ÄúTransport Company‚Äù, on the 1st place in the Special Placement block.  In Moscow and St. Petersburg, the numbers are even greater. <br><br>  On average for an advertising campaign, the price per click is $ 5.5.  (165 rubles). <br><br>  Traffic for all requests goes to the landing page with the proposal to get the calculation of cargo delivery: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/69a/2ab/976/69a2ab9769234a35b877fd9cbbccac23.jpg"><br><br>  Conversion of the page in the application - 3.7%. <br><br>  Yandex Direct for the company - the main source of applications.  At the same time, there is a problem of the underfilling of the fleet in separate months.  Of course, you can "fight" for top requests, but with the current business margin it is unprofitable.  For example, at the request of "Shipping in Russia" the end customer costs 80,580 rubles. <br><br>  Plus, the owners additionally purchased 2 trucks, so orders are also needed for them. <br><br>  The task is to increase the number of incoming applications from Yandex.Direct with the same budget. <br><br>  <b>What did</b> <br><br>  1) RK was divided into 32 separate campaigns, separately for each region.  This made it possible to optimize control over budget expenditures, since different cost per click is different in different regions.  As a result, additional budget savings of 11.5%. <br><br>  2) Expanded semantic core due to low-frequency queries, where there is less competition.  For example, by type of cargo - ‚ÄúTransportation of equipment‚Äù, ‚ÄúTransportation of cable‚Äù, ‚ÄúTransportation of construction goods‚Äù, etc.  Plus, they increased the number of geo-requests for directions, for example, ‚ÄúShipping Perm - Kirov‚Äù.  As a result, they reduced the price of a click to 4.3 USD.  (129 rubles). <br><br>  3) Synchronized advertising campaigns with <b><a href="http://yagla.ru/">Yagla</a></b> in one click, they marked the landing page heading for substitution.  According to our statistics, it is the title, more precisely, the value proposition in the title decides whether the visitor leaves the application. <br><br>  The marking process takes place directly in the system interface, the page itself does not change. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2f9/3cd/b5e/2f93cdb5e82a4b939bb5dfdd92549045.jpg"><br><br>  In the screenshot: mark the title as a dynamic element. <br><br>  4) In the editor, the Jagla submenus divided all key requests into 134 groups, since it does not require direct correspondence here, as in Yandex Direct.  If we see several requests showing the same need, feel free to combine them into one group.  And the substitution is configured specifically for this group. <br><br>  For example: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/018/e03/a45/018e03a454d841e2aac65698d3915ed5.jpg"><br><br>  As a result, under any of these three requests, users see the heading ‚ÄúForwarding services.  Cargo insurance". <br><br>  On the landing page, it looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/018/e03/a45/018e03a454d841e2aac65698d3915ed5.jpg"><br><br>  Exact compliance is necessary where the requests contain an indication of the brand of the truck or a specific type of cargo. <br><br>  For example, under the request ‚ÄúKAMAZ Freight Transportation‚Äù we made the title ‚ÄúKAMAZ Freight Transportation.  Cargo insured. <br><br>  Thus, an effective model of a replaceable header is ‚ÄúIndication of need + Value‚Äù.  The value here is cargo insurance. <br><br>  5) In order to set up the sending of contacts from the application form.  This is an important point for understanding the effectiveness of substitutions.  When goals are set up on the site (what you are tracking), Jagla performs automatic a / b tests - compares the conversion of each substitution with the original.  That is, half of the users see a header with a substitution for some request, half - the original version. <br><br>  In the editor, next to each substitution - statistics, as it worked on the conversion.  As a result, you can quickly replace or correct one or another version of the replaced item if it shows a conversion worse than the source code. <br><br>  6) After 3 weeks of testing, the average project conversion of the site from 3.7% rose to 5.9%.  An increase of 62.7%. <br><br>  7) We did not stop at that, and the next step was to set up substitutions in the signature to the application form and the call-to-action button.  The original version of the call "Get the calculation of the delivery of your goods" in many cases did not coincide in meaning with the substitution in the title. <br><br>  For example, under the request ‚ÄúForwarding services‚Äù the page with substitutions looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2b3/e42/93a/2b3e4293a92d487caeaf172c2b7c03aa.jpg"><br><br>  If we are already personalizing the site, this should apply to all semantic elements. <br><br>  After another 3 weeks of tests, the average project conversion was 7.1%.  The overall increase is 91.2%.  This means that for 2 months of the project, the company received 91.2% more applications from contextual advertising. <br><br>  8) Here are the common numbers before and after the launch of the project. <br><br>  <b>It was</b> <br><br>  Price per click is 165 rubles. <br>  Number of clicks 735 <br>  Budget 121 275 rub. <br>  Conversion to the request of 3.7% <br>  Number of applications 27 <br><br>  <b>It became</b> <br><br>  Price per click 129 rubles. <br>  Number of clicks 730 <br>  Budget 94 170 rub. <br>  Conversion to bid 7.1% <br>  Number of applications 52 <br><br>  The budget is less by 22.4%.  At the same time, the number of requests for the company's services increased by almost 2 times, which made it possible to increase the load of the fleet to 96% even during the fall of freight activity (the project is in October-November).  Including, to provide orders for new trucks. <br><br>  After the first success, the company sets the task of ‚Äúdiscouraging‚Äù competitors' bids for top requests and become a market leader in the region. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299174/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299174/</a></p>
