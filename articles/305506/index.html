      Therefore, we decided to expand the range of equipment available to the hackathon participants - and now it will include sets of wireless modules of the 6LoWPAN network developed by Unwired Devices, which, in conjunction with Tarantool and Edison, will allow the participants to accomplish anything. <br><br>  In total, technologies will be available to hackathon members: <br><ul><li>  A set of sensors and control devices Unwired Devices for 6LoWPAN network </li><li>  Gateway between 6LoWPAN and Wi-Fi based on Intel Edison microcomputer </li><li>  The Tarantool DBMS running on the gateway provides processing and reliable data replication </li></ul><br><br>  Moreover, representatives of the venture capital investor CommIT Capital owned by Rostelecom will also visit the hackathon. <br><br>  <a href="https://corp.mail.ru/ru/press/events/235/">Apply</a> and come! <br><br>  PS What exactly will be included in the sets - under the cut. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/780/887/ec2/780887ec2d5e486bb460b230a03c63e8.jpg"><br><br>  6LoWPAN is one of the newest networking technologies developed specifically for the ‚ÄúInternet of Things‚Äù;  in fact, IPv6 adapted for the 802.15.4 physical layer ‚Äî which, in turn, is adapted for low-speed wireless networks with a small typical data packet size and a very large number of devices. <br><br>  In addition, the hackathon will also feature communication modules for LoRa networks (Unwired Range model) - with a range of up to 30 km (in words: thirty kilometers) in direct line of sight, as well as some industrial solutions based on these technologies.  However, from the point of view of working with Tarantool, there is not much difference between LoRa and 6LoWPAN - the Unwired Range and Unwired Mesh are compatible both in connectors and in the top-level API, therefore, having completed the project on one type of module, you can easily transfer it to another . <br><br>  A complete list of Unwired Kit modules can be found on <a href="http://www.unwireddevices.com/ru/products/umdk">the company's website</a> .  The modules included in the standard set for the hackathon are listed below - but if we see interesting projects for which other modules or even whole devices can be useful, we will also try to provide them. <br><br><h3>  UMDK-EDISON </h3><br><br>  Gateway module from LoRa and 6LoWPAN networks to Wi-Fi.  Due to the high performance and memory capacity of <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/do-it-yourself/edison.html">Intel Edison</a> , this is not just a packet translator between two different environments - but a full-fledged server for processing data received from the IoT network and managing it.  Edison will install Tarantool, which makes solving these tasks even easier and more efficient. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/946/09b/9cd/94609b9cdd6a4cfba74bb5ad55b1a316.png"><br><br>  In addition to Edison itself, the module is equipped with bidirectional translators of logic levels TI TXB0108 and TXB0102 (GPIO Edison works with 1.8 V, the rest of the dialing modules with 3.3 V), and 8 additional GPIO and USB ports are outside. <br><br><h3>  UMDK-RF / 868 </h3><br><br>  Radio 6LoWPAN network for the license-free 868-869 MHz band using the latest generation of TI SimpleLink chips - <a href="http://www.ti.com/product/CC1310">CC1310</a> .  The range of work is up to 200 meters in direct visibility at full speed (50 kbps).  It is possible to connect one or several sensors and actuating devices to each radio module, both in its own Unwired Kit format and in the Grove Starter Kit Plus format. <br><br><h3>  UMDK-JTAG </h3><br><br>  Programmer with JTAG support (for LoRa modules) and UART-loader (for 6LoWPAN modules).  It allows you to quickly update the firmware of the modules - for example, to assemble one large one from two different sets, change the radio band, or add a ready block to the firmware to support the desired sensor if you wish to combine several sensors on the same radio module. <br><br><h3>  UMDK-THP </h3><br><br>  High-precision digital temperature, humidity and barometric pressure sensor based on Sensirion <a href="https://www.sensirion.com/products/humidity-sensors/humidity-temperature-sensor-sht2x-digital-i2c-accurate/">SHT21</a> and STMicro <a href="http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/mems-and-sensors/pressure-sensors/lps331ap.html">LPS331AP chips</a> .  It is useful both in the "smart home" and, for example, in maintaining the climate in the greenhouse. <br><br><h3>  UMDK-LIT </h3><br><br>  High-precision digital ambient light sensor based on the TI <a href="http://www.ti.com/product/OPT3001">OPT3001</a> chip with a sensitivity curve corresponding to the human eye.  Great for automatic dimming systems. <br><br><h3>  UMDK-SOIL </h3><br><br>  Capacitive high-frequency sensor of humidity and surface temperature of the soil.  It has no electrical contact with the soil, and therefore, in contrast to common soil conductivity sensors, it is not susceptible to corrosion.  A working frequency of 50 MHz minimizes the dependence of sensor readings on the salt composition of the soil. <br><br><h3>  UMDK-2AA </h3><br><br>  Self-contained power module with two AA batteries.  Provides a voltage of 5 V and allows you to turn on the UMDK-RF modules with sensors far from the socket (if the socket is close - the UMDK-RF can be powered from any charger with a microUSB connector). <br><br><h3>  UMDK-2RDC </h3><br><br>  Two ordinary DC relays.  High-quality <a href="https://www.omron.com/ecb/products/pdf/en-g6d.pdf">Omron G6D</a> relays are <a href="https://www.omron.com/ecb/products/pdf/en-g6d.pdf">used</a> , designed for 5 A at 250 V AC.  However, if you need to switch a really powerful load, it is better to choose the UMDK-1RAC module with a special circuit that eliminates the sparking of the relay contacts and reduces the starting currents. <br><br><h3>  UMDK-GRV </h3><br><br>  Adapter module for sensors from the Grove Starter Kit.  Most sensors capable of operating at 3.3V are supported. In addition, the Unwired Devices - UMDK-ACC / T and UMDK-SOIL remote sensors are connected to the same module. <br><br><h3>  UMDK-ACC / T </h3><br><br>  Remote vibration sensor (ST <a href="http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/mems-and-sensors/inemo-inertial-modules/lsm6ds3.html">LSM6DS3 gyro-accelerometer</a> ) and surface temperature (NXP <a href="http://www.nxp.com/products/sensors/isup2-supc-temperature-voltage-monitors/digital-temperature-sensor-and-thermal-watchdog:LM75AD">LM75AD</a> ).  It is extremely useful in monitoring the status of industrial equipment ‚Äî for example, by raising the temperature or amplitude of vibrations, we can predict the machine‚Äôs early failure and plan its maintenance before this failure happens. <br><br><h2>  O tarantool </h2><br><br>  Tarantool is a universal IoT platform, which is a general purpose DBMS with an application server inside.  Tarantool is designed to work both on IoT devices and in the cloud, ensuring reliable synchronization between them in both directions.  The main distinctive feature of Tarantool is that it is very undemanding of resources.  It can work on a single processor core, even very slow.  It can work from a few megabytes of memory.  It can store data on a slow and unreliable flush, without killing it with constant overwrites (because Tarantool does not do it at all).  At the same time, it securely saves each transaction to disk or flash. <br><br>  By developing using Tarantool as a local platform on IoT devices, you get the same system status on all devices and on the central server.  Moreover, each device works independently with the current copy of data, even when Internet access is blinking or not working (when access is restored, all data is instantly replicated in both directions). <br><br>  Tarantool is a real powerful IoT platform for developing full and fast-running local applications with full synchronization between devices and a central server and with almost complete independence from access to the Internet. <br><br><h2>  Ob edison </h2><br><br>  Intel Edison is a powerful, ultra-compact, highly integrated ‚Äúsystem on module‚Äù, equipped with an Intel Atom processor with a frequency of 500 MHz, 4 GB of flash memory, 1 GB of RAM and built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth adapters.  In the ‚ÄúInternet of things‚Äù systems, Edison can provide excellent performance and opportunities for data collection and processing at the gateway between the IoT network and the Internet ‚Äî all with extremely modest size and power consumption, which allows the Edison to be powered from the battery when necessary. <br><br><h2>  Unwired devices </h2><br><br>  Unwired Devices company specializes in the development and production of modern electronics, primarily, embedded microcomputer and network communication devices.  The company's interests include the technologies of the Internet of Things, Wi-Fi and mesh networks (mesh networks), LoRa networks, products for the automation of industrial lighting, wireless control and data collection, as well as the system of "smart" home and "smart" office. <br><br>  The Unwired Kit is a set of electronic modules designed for the rapid development of Internet of Things devices: IoT controllers and routers, cellular networks, long-range LoRa networks, including various types of sensors, controls and actuators.  In addition to typical modules, the kit includes modules with interfaces widely used in industrial systems, such as DALI, PWM 0-10 V or RS-485. <br><br><h2>  CommIT Capital </h2><br><br>  CommIT Capital is a corporate fund of Rostelecom PJSC.  The purpose of ‚ÄúCOMMIT Capital‚Äù is to find innovative companies in the market, whose business is complementary to the business of the telecommunications operator, and to invest in the best of them.  Such companies must have unique competencies in their fields and have a high-tech product with export potential.  In turn, the fund helps them develop and realize synergies with Rostelecom. <br><br>  Priority areas for investment are companies developing products for the network infrastructure of the operator and data centers.  No less interesting are corporate solutions.  The Fund also considers projects with new products and services for Rostelecom's end customers in the B2C, B2B and B2G segments. <br><br>  The fund‚Äôs portfolio includes Raidix (developer of data storage systems) and Brain4Net (solutions for operators and corporations in the field of SDN &amp; NFV). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/305506/">https://habr.com/ru/post/305506/</a></p>
