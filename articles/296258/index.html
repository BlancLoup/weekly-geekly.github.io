      After a couple of weeks of fruitful work by a programmer and a security specialist, <b>the authorization algorithm has been implemented</b> and is now <b>the main way to connect</b> clients to the service. <br><br>  <b>What is OAuth?</b> <br><br>  Speaking in a dry technical language, this is an authorization protocol that allows you to give one service (in this case, Invola) the right to access user resources on another service (access to mail). <br><br>  The user has more reason to trust the application, since the user can be sure that unauthorized access to his personal data is impossible.  Without owning the user's login and password, the <b>application will be able to perform</b> only those <b>actions</b> with the data <b>that the user has authorized</b> , and no other. <br><br>  Simply put, you can say this: the Invola service connects to your email to receive bills and offers, without requiring a login and password, but requesting the right of access.  If you confirm - the application gets access until it is recalled by the user, or until the application exists and is active at all. <br><br>  Briefly, the principle of OAuth authorization in conjunction with Invola is shown in the picture below. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/619/d45/e49/619d45e49e3142a2a5e89443901522cc.jpg"><br><br>  The communication between Invola and the mail server uses the access token access token (step 4-5), which automatically becomes obsolete after one hour and is updated as necessary (automatically, without user intervention, by Invola software). <br><br>  Now let's talk about security, and why <b>OAuth authorization is preferable to login-password</b> . <br><br>  When you provide any service with a username and password to access your account (mail.ru, gmail.com), you actually provide a password for the entire account (this way you can access, for example, a disk, photo albums and other personal data). <br><br>  <b>By providing access through OAuth,</b> you yourself <b>control which resources of the</b> account <b>you give access to</b> .  Consider an example of the rights requested when connecting to Invola: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/baa/580/c49/baa580c495564c18bf39ca8f09bd5605.png"><br><br>  " <i>View and manage mail</i> " - to automatically receive invoices and KP, " <i>view address</i> " - to get the email address of the mailbox, " <i>view profile</i> " - to get the user name (required at the registration stage). <br><br>  Unfortunately, <b>not all mail servers</b> (including corporate ones) <b>support</b> <b>OAuth</b> <b>authentication</b> , in particular, the popular Yandex.Mail service.  If your mail is on Yandex, you can only connect to our service at the moment using your login password. <br><br>  <b>A little about security</b> . <br><br>  We understand very well how critical the leakage of confidential data or unauthorized access to customer data, financial transactions, personal correspondence is to business.  <b>Data security is one of our top priorities</b> . <br><br>  Access tokens, as well as e-mail access passwords, are stored on a secure, dedicated database server using a cryptographic scheme based on dynamic keys. <br><br>  As a result, it is worth noting that our employees do not have access to mail servers and correspondence of our users under any circumstances. <br><br>  <b>All communications</b> between the user and the service, as well as between the service and the mail server are <b>carried out over a secure SSL channel</b> , in other words, all transmitted data in both directions is encrypted using a strong cryptographic algorithm. <br><br>  - If you have a business, you send a lot of bills and offers to your customers, then you simply must try our system.  <b>Invola sends automatic alerts</b> if there is no response to the account, and also monitors the reaction of your customers to the accounts (expensive, long delivery time, etc.).  As a result, <b>you get an increase in the share of paid bills</b> , and also have the opportunity to collect statistics on the performance of your managers, frequent reasons for refusals. <br><br>  <b><a href="https://invola.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dblog%26utm_campaign%3DOAuthConnect">Sign up now</a></b> , set up in 5 minutes and work for free for a month. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296258/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296258/</a></p>
