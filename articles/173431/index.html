It gives very high power (W / kg, W / l), high specific energy (Wh / kg, Wh / l) and can be carried out on non-magnetic materials.  The largest (22,000 Ah, 420 kg) and the smallest (0.17 Ah, 4.5 g) prismatic energy cells in the world are made according to this scheme.  Here are some products that use these batteries: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f25/a11/37c/f25a1137ca5eb604f4e4c1e03256713f.png" align="right"><ul><li>  Batteries for aerospace vehicles, including space shuttles and stations both in the USA and Russia (including Sputnik-1 cm ill.).  Batteries of moon rovers, mars rovers and space probes </li><li>  The largest rechargeable batteries (256 tons in the USA, 300 tons in Russia) - both for submarines, batteries for bathyscaphes, torpedoes </li></ul><br>  It is striking that these devices are either from the aerospace or from the defense field, and they have one feature: the performance characteristics here prevail over the economic ones.  The price of silver does not allow this technology to step into consumer goods.  The only niche on which it has firmly entrenched is microbatches for watches, since the price of such a small battery in the total cost of the product is negligible. <br>  There is another problem: the relative non-rechargeability of such cells caused by the rapid degradation of the electrode.  Moreover, even this reversible reaction has a nominal voltage of about 1.2V versus 1.55V of an irreversible reaction, which reduces the energy of such a battery. <br>  Ross Dueber presents 1.55 Volt Rechargeable Technology.  Here is the literal translation of one of the <a href="http://www.zmp.com/technology/index.htm"><font color="000000">press releases.</font></a> <br><br><h1>  <font color="b18a8a">Taking Silver-Zinc technology to a new level</font> </h1><br>  ZPower uses all the latest advances in polymers, nanotechnology, power electronics and processing methods to create a battery far superior to all existing in performance, safety for us and the environment. <br><h6>  ZPower's success lies in innovation in three elements: </h6><br><ol><li>  <b>Composite Zinc Anode</b> <br>  ZPower Zinc Anode Batteries are a composite electrode whose structure prevents dendrite reshaping and growth.  In the past, these problems have been a stumbling block in traditional silver-zinc cells.  these problems were solved by the new original ZPower technology. </li><li>  <b>Multi-layer and multifunctional separator</b> <br>  ZPower has created a highly efficient separator that hinders the growth of dendrites on the anode on the one hand, and prevents the degradation of the silver cathode on the other.  At the same time, it allows the free movement of ions from the cathode to the anode, minimizing the internal resistance of the cell.  As a result of a power cell with a long service life and fast charging. </li><li>  <b>Nanoparticle Cathode</b> <br>  The silver cathode ZPower consists of coated silver nanoparticles.  This nanotechnology provides high conductivity, reducing also the general internal resistance. </li></ol><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c90/541/740/c905417407bdf327886b810c3ae4de99.jpg" align="left"><br><h6>  Benefits of Silver Zinc technology </h6><br><br><ul><li>  <b>High performance</b> - 40% more energy than lithium-ion and 2-3 times more than Nickel Metal Hydride </li><li>  <b>Clean technology</b> - no mercury in the layout, where more than 95% of the elements can be recycled and reused </li><li>  <b>Safety</b> - Zinc batteries are thermally stable and safe by themselves. </li></ul>

    <h1>  <font color="b18a8a">Reality</font> </h1><br>  It all sounds very cool, and the company also boasts of agreements with Apple, Intel, and the US military.  In 2012, a patent was confirmed for the entire cell.  Well, can you rejoice? <br>  Who else but we, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mugenpower/">Mugen Power</a> , are interested in such a niche technology, but from the very beginning it was not clear why such a narrow circle of researchers is interested in such a hot topic. <br>  Now we can look at the <a href="http://www.google.ru/patents/EP1380060A1%3Fcl%3Den%26dq%3Dzinc%2Bmatrix%2Bpower%2Banode%26hl%3Den%26sa%3DX%26ei%3Dg5k3UYGoFeas4ASvpoDgAQ%26ved%3D0CDAQ6AEwAA">patents</a> of Zpower itself, make an upper estimate of capacity and energy per gram of battery and compare them with modern <a href="http://industrial.panasonic.com/www-cgi/jvcr21pz.cgi%3FE%2BBA%2B3%2BACA4001%2B4%2B%2BWW">lithium-ion</a> cells, as well as modern <a href="http://www.sony.net/Products/MicroBattery/sr/spec.html">commercial non-rechargeable Ag-Zn</a> , as with the ceiling of rechargeable technology. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c25/bd8/74b/c25bd874bbaf3aa22deef513d082d4e7.png" align="left"><br><h5>  How so!?  Where is 40% in energy?  She loses Li-ion!  Could it be, and why? </h5><br>  To begin with, in spite of the fact that Zpower has been actively stirring up interest in its activities to this day, the claimed advantages have not changed in any way since 2004, while the Li-ion technology has gone a long way. <br>  The prospects for lithium-ion technology were already evident then, and the key advantage at that time, against the background of mass battery recall, was not so much capacity as safety. <br>  The risk in the innovation business does not even lie in what may not turn out, but in what may turn out too late: in these almost 10 years the acuteness of this issue has subsided noticeably, which has spoiled the prospects of Zpower. <br><br><h1>  <font color="b18a8a">Perspectives</font> </h1><br>  From my lines it may seem that everything is lost for this technology, but it is not. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b95/b94/d66/b95b94d663104dbb7087b591cfaab41e.jpeg" align="right"><br>  In terms of capacity, such a technology is still ahead of lithium-ion, in power, too.  A strong loss in voltage is also an advantage, since it is under 1.5 V that many household appliances are designed.  Of course, the cost of such batteries will be high, but feasible, but the charge will not hold longer as Nickel-Metal Hydride. <br>  The company itself hopes to occupy the hearing aid battery market.  Many ultracompact hearing aids use non-rechargeable Zinc-air batteries that have similar voltage.  Having a rechargeable device for a hearing impaired person is far more important than most of us might think.  Imagine: one morning you wake up and do not hear anything, you are an elderly person and you cannot replace the micro battery yourself, and until you insert a new one, you will be tormented by the fear of total hearing loss.  Zpower batteries should work for a long time and, importantly, do not heat up when working (without causing discomfort to the auricle). <br>  The military will get significantly improved technology from ZPower. <br>  And finally, for the future: ZPower managed to overcome the problem of dendritic formation of a zinc electrode, which can help create a rechargeable Zinc-Air cell. <br><br><h1>  Urgently in the room!  Zpower strikes back </h1><br>  Do not believe it!  Just before my eyes, the ASUS netbook caught fire.  Bought two years ago, a regular battery <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/74f/167/638/74f167638a1e1d10976c8b8da849b0ed.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/33d/1aa/3f8/33d1aa3f8c0880c64db2a718893005af.jpg"><br>  it's only the beginning </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/173431/">https://habr.com/ru/post/173431/</a></p>
