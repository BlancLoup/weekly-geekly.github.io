Part two</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> <b>Warren Buffett, Trey and Melinda Gates</b> <br><img src="http://f.imagehost.org/0398/POW27_P.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>After he left the walls of Harvard University at the age of 21 in order to found Microsoft, William Henry Gates the Third also stubbornly won victory after victory now in the field of operating systems for personal computers.</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the process, he earned a huge fortune - according to Forbes estimates, this year it is about 40 billion dollars. <br>  In the distant 1996th, an 88 percent breakthrough in Microsoft shares meant that he earned more than $ 10.9 billion (on paper), or about $ 30 million dollars a day. <br>  Today, he is <a href="http://lenta.ru/news/2009/03/12/richlist/">again the richest man on the planet.</a>  But it is much more.  He became Edison and Ford of our age. <br>  An engineer who has become a successful entrepreneur, Bill Gates personifies the digital age. <br><br>  His success is almost entirely rooted in his individuality: an incredible and sometimes frightening mixture of genius, drive, a constant desire to compete and a furious rhythm of life. <br>  This largely sets the course for Microsoft.

    <img src="http://f.imagehost.org/0408/nathan_myhrvold.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>"The personality of Bill Gates completely determined the culture of Microsoft," confirms his friend and constant intellectual duelist Nathan Mirvold.</i> <br><br><img src="http://f.imagehost.org/0588/GatesOpenerLo.jpg" alt="image"><br>  “I don’t think there is anything unique in the human mind,” says Gates at lunch in an almost empty Indian restaurant in a shopping center near his office.  Even while eating, he seems to be in multitasking mode: equally wielding both his right and left hands, Gates throws the plug from one to the other, using his free hand to gesticulate or write something. <br>  “All the neurons in the human brain that are responsible for perception and emotions work almost according to binary principles.  We will ever reproduce it on a machine, I am sure. <br>  Earthly life is based on carbon, computers are based on silicon, but this is not a key difference. <br>  Sooner or later, scientists will be able to isolate and read the human genome, and understand how nature has breathed the mind into a carbon-based system. ” <br><br>  “Of course,” he adds, “the idea itself seems a bit intimidating, however,” continues with a slight grin, <br>  "It will still be a scam."  “It’s as if the programmer did reverse engineering of someone’s product in order to understand how his competitor handled the task.” <br><br>  “Y-yes.  Do you think there is anything special, perhaps even divine in the human soul? ” <br><br>  His face loses expression, the tone becomes colorless.  Gates folds his hands on his stomach and begins to sway strongly in his chair.  In the end, in the same colorless tone, completely on the machine he answers: “Well, I don’t have evidence”, sways again, forward, backward - “I don’t have evidence ...” <br><br>  “When he was just a kid, he terribly loved swinging back and forth in his crib,” recalls Gates's father, a rather large man, while Bill is a short man and rather frail. <br><br>  <b>William Henry Gates Sr.</b> <br><img src="http://f.imagehost.org/0521/40A_Gates2_RGB_75dpi.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  He is a retired lawyer, and he lives in that old house in the suburbs of Seattle, on the shores of Lake Washington, where Bill the Third — the boy he still calls Trey (Trey, a three-card term) means. <br><br>  “His mother was a truly spectacular woman,” says Bill Senior.  As a daughter of a banker, she was very well oriented in both social and business environments.  For a long time, she worked at the University of Washington, and was President of the United Way Charitable Association.  After her death, in 1994, the city council named the street leading to their house in her honor. <br><br>  "Trey, in terms of communication with peers, had to be tight ...", - recalls his father. <br>  “I remember how he suffered for two weeks before inviting some girl to a school ball.  And she still eventually refused ... " <br><br>  As we go through the house with him, he shows all the new photos of his son: here stands the blond smiling Gates, the scout, here he is with his sister, Christie, (she is a year older than him), who now happily works for him in the position a tax consultant, but with the youngest Libby - they have 9 years of difference.  She lives nearby, just a couple of blocks away, and has two children.  Here he is with Bill Senior and his wife Mimi, Director of the Seattle Museum of Art, so he embraces Melinda, during a performance by Willie Nelson at a New Year's party in 1994 in Hawaii. <br><br>  <b>Bill the Elder with his wife Mimi</b> <br><img src="http://f.imagehost.org/0295/gateswife.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Elder sister Christie</b> <br><img src="http://f.imagehost.org/0603/blake.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Family photo</b> <br><img src="http://f.imagehost.org/0887/gates_family.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>The Gates Family, 1970</i>  <i>From left to right: Libby, Bill, Christie, Mary, and Bill Sr.</i> <br><br>  <b>Another family photo - later</b> <br><img src="http://f.imagehost.org/0519/rt-2-3d1.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>From left to right: Bill, Christie, Bill Sr. and Libby.</i>  <i>India 2008</i> <br><br>  <b>Queen Elizabeth the Second knights Gates</b> <br><img src="http://f.imagehost.org/0862/bill-gates-knighthood-photo.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  “He is a busy guy,” smiles Bill Senior, “so we don’t often see each other, but we spend holidays together.” <br>  “Thanksgiving in Spokane, Washington County, at Christie’s house, playing golf at Palm Springs for Christmas, where Bill and Melinda have a small house.” <br>  They communicate with the father mainly by e-mail.  Just this morning, he received a letter from his son, which described what a wonderful photocopier Trey bought him as a birthday present. <br><br>  In 1986, when Microsoft came to success, Gates bought a small village (called Gateway) for four houses for his family.  There, his parents for a long time helped him spend summer amusement outings for dozens of friends and colleagues, who later became known as Microgames. <br><br>  “The mandatory part of the program was games for quick-wittedness, battle of minds.  Although there were just quizzes and contests, ”says Bill Sr., turning the pages of a photo album.  There were no usual picnics: for example, during one of the games the teams had to compete in sending numeric messages to each other using smoke signaling machines, the winners had to come up with their own 4-bit binary code. <br><br>  <b>Bill Sr. and his wife Mary</b> <br><img src="http://f.imagehost.org/0421/bill-gates-parents-photo.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  “We started worrying about him when it was time to move to the seventh grade,” recalls Bill Sr., “he was so small and modest, and his interests were so very different from those of a regular sixth grader.” <br>  His intellectual drive and curiosity could hardly be satisfied in a regular urban school.  And the parents decide to send him to an elite private school at the other end of the city. <br><br><img src="http://f.imagehost.org/0532/bill-gates_1.jpg" alt="image"><br>  When we walk with him around the wide courtyard of Lakeside School, Bill Sr. shows his hand to a small amphitheater: there his son once even played a major role in the school play “Black Comedy” by Peter Shaffer. <br>  “He liked it a lot, he was burning with enthusiasm about the stage, of course.  But what really occupied him was here, ”he says, pointing to the educational building, a small building with a spire on top. <br>  It was in this building that a bulky teletype terminal stood, bought with money from the mothers club from the yard sale. <br><br><img src="http://f.imagehost.org/0248/leftnav_home.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://f.imagehost.org/0342/School_picture.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Studying the BASIC language from one of the first versions of his documentation, with a friend Paul Allen, Trey in eighth grade will write two whole programs: the first one translates numbers entered from the keyboard from one number system to another, the second one they played with Allen for a long time, there were tic-tac-toe. <br><br><img src="http://f.imagehost.org/0246/gates_and_allen_450px.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Later, Gates, fascinated by the literature on the military strategies of the emperor Napoleon, will write a computer version of the game Risk, a board game that he loves very much and the goal in which is world domination. <br><br>  The wise advice of the “senior adviser” (see the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/it_bigraphy/56833/">beginning of the story</a> ) and his fascination with computers shaped him as a self-confident young businessman. <br>  By the end of the school, he and his friends open a small company that even makes a profit and is engaged in analyzing and graphically presenting information about traffic on the city’s roads. <br><br>  “At that time, his self-confidence greatly increased, and his sense of humor was a bargain,” recalls the father.  “He became a great storyteller, could imitate the voices of various characters.  And he finally made up with his mother. " <br><br>  “In the ninth grade,” Bill Gates himself recalls, “I came up with a new form of resistance.  I was not particularly keen on getting top marks in school.  And yet, this time I decided to get all the “A” nothing at all bison at home. <br>  I did not go to mathematics in principle, because I knew enough about the subject, and I also read ahead. <br>  The goal was easily achieved.  This strengthened my independence, and taught me that you can no longer rebel. " <br>  In the tenth, he already teaches the subject of computers and writes a program that builds up the grid of school timetables.  Which has a secret function, assigning it to some classes with girls that he likes. <br><br><img src="http://ontechnology.files.wordpress.com/2008/06/bill-gates-ad.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  His best friend was Kent Evans, and very little is known about him, except that his father had a high rank in the Unitarian church. <br>  “We read Fortune together, we were going to take over the world,” smiles Gate, “yes, I still remember his phone number by heart.” <br>  Three of them (Gates, Evans and Allen) they organize such an official-sounding Lakeside Programmers Group and even receive an order to develop a payment system for a local firm. <br><br>  A terrible quarrel (the first of many) occurred when Allen tried to pull everything over.  But he quickly realized <br>  that tireless gates he needs. <br>  “Okay,” Gates told him, “but then I’m in charge.” <br><br>  To relieve tension after long hours of programming, Evans goes in for climbing. <br>  One day, Gates was called by the director and reported that Evans had fallen and crashed during a workout. <br>  “I have never before encountered death ...” says Gates.  Again the same colorless tone, detached look.  “At the farewell ceremony, I had to give a speech, but I could not even get up from the bench.  After that, I could not do anything for another two weeks. ” <br><br>  After that, he gets even closer to Paul Allen.  Together they continue to learn to code and find occasional part-time jobs as programmers.  “We were real partners,” recalls those years Gates, “spent hours discussing something day after day, deliberating, arguing.” <br>  After Gates went to Harvard to study, Allen drove his cross-country Chrysler several times a month for hours to prevent the end of friendship and cooperation. <br><br>  <b>Gates and allen</b> <br><img src="http://f.imagehost.org/0691/allen-gates.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It is he who ultimately convinces Gates to become that famous Harvard student for the sake of creating a new software development company.  Initially, they dubbed it “Mikro-Soft” (Micro-Soft, but this is after a long discussion of the name “Gates and Allen Incorporated”). <br><br>  The starting point in the plans of partners was the not so trivial task of writing a new version of the BASIC language for the first personal computers.  And it was a truly strong alliance.  Gates, coder and workaholic, with his insatiable desire to always and with everyone compete.  And Allen, the dreamer and dreamer. <br><br><h6>  The first logo options are: </h6><br>  Do not forget, this was the disco era <br><img src="http://f.imagehost.org/0511/old-microsoft-logo.png" alt="image"><br><img src="http://f.imagehost.org/0521/msdos.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://f.imagehost.org/0186/2190898074_f6cdfff206.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Finally, all sorts of tastes: </h4><br>  <b>Interview <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D2-kI0urN9tI">from the second minute</a></b> <br>  Probably the earliest his video that you can find. <br>  <i>(Correct if wrong)</i> <br><br>  <b>Video from Fortune magazine.</b> <br>  About Gates tell his father, sister and colleagues.
