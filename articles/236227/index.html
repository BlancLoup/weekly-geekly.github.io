To do this, just need to fill out an application for participation, describing your project, the desired task and the desired result. <a name="habracut"></a>

      As a result, you will receive materials that: <br>  ‚Ä¢ denote a wide range of tasks facing designers that can be solved using the Autodesk Simulation product line; <br>  ‚Ä¢ allow yourself to repeat the entire process of solving, using the products of Autodesk Simulation; <br>  ‚Ä¢ demonstrate the main problems arising in the course of solving design problems, and approaches to their solution. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7d5/cef/174/7d5cef174654464794bdff81f13a1321.jpg" align="right"><br>  The procedure for participation in the project Masters of Simulation is simple.  "At the entrance" the participant provides as input data his 3D or 2D model and description of the tasks, as well as information about himself and his organization.  "At the exit" receives video and text materials, which describe the solution of these and related problems, as well as emerging problems.  These materials are published online, and links to them are sent to the "customer". <br><br>  At the same time, POINT Company and Autodesk will be able to use the obtained information (product geometry, problem statement, project results, customer information) for open publications, marketing materials and others. <br><br>  Those participants who want to see the solution to their problems, but do not want to give out their know-how or violate the terms of contracts, can modify the initial data of the geometry and setting. <br><br>  For the current project, the list of software used is limited to the following products *: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Autodesk Simulation Mechanical; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Autodesk Simulation CFD; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Autodesk Sim 360 (Simulus). <br><br>  * Calculations using Autodesk Simulation Moldflow and Autodesk Simulation Composite products will not be performed under this project. <br><br>  Here are just a few examples of using Autodesk Simulation products in practice: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Customer 1: leader in the production of water treatment equipment. <br>  Result: The following tasks were solved using Autodesk Simulation CFD: the uniformity of water flow through the industrial filter was determined;  revealed a pressure change in the layer of filter material;  visualized flow lines of fluid movement in the structure;  pressure drop in switchgears has been determined. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5c8/5a1/1af/5c85a11aff234b2cbfb8097f7aed4bbf.jpg"><br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Customer 2: a company engaged in the development and production of high-tech intelligent control and communication systems, <br>  Result: Due to the use of Autodesk Simulation CFD, a lot of positive results were revealed: the opportunity appeared for the calculation analysis of heat and mass transfer without full-scale tests, and the accuracy of the program calculations was within the margin of error, i.e.  very close to the results of field tests;  reduced time spent on the calculation of complex electronic devices. <br>  ‚Ä¢ In one of the data centers, a simulation of air conditioning and ventilation systems was carried out using the product Autodesk Simulation CFD.  As a result of the simulation, it was determined: distribution of air flow in the data center;  possible stagnant zones;  temperature field distribution.  All this allowed us to quickly and as accurately as possible design a new data center room. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b43/d1c/cd6/b43d1ccd6a7b41ecadb13fa24fb9f251.jpg"><br><br>  Due to the fact that the project Masters of Simulation is being held for the first time, it is impossible to predict in advance the number of applications and their complexity, a list of tasks will be formed on the basis of the entire list, according to which they are solved and materials are published.  For individual typical tasks (for example, which are discussed earlier), a simple statement of the possibility of calculation will be made with demonstration of the results.  For the most interesting and characteristic tasks, not only a detailed description of the sequence of actions of the solution will be published, but also a list of various emerging problems, related tasks, and so on. <br><br>  Are you interested in our offer?  Then fill in the <a href="http://simulation.pointcad.ru/masters_of_simulation_submission_form">application form for participation</a> ! <br>  We are ready to consider any of your wishes regarding the project. <br><br>  If you have any questions, write to simulation@autodesk.com or call +7 (495) 781-54-81 (ext. 173 or 126). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/236227/">https://habr.com/ru/post/236227/</a></p>
