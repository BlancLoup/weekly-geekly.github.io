But since Vtiger 5.3 performed its functions, it was decided to leave everything as it is, following the principle - the best enemy of the good. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/042/bdf/eee/042bdfeee7274a98ba5a5927e69cc09d.png"><br><br>  A year later, when choosing software for managing a project office (but for a completely different project), I ran into Advanta.

      The program was more than just a project management environment.  I will not go into details, the program‚Äôs website has a detailed description of it, let me just say that the program seemed to me to be a designer, with which you can independently and quickly set up any management environment. <br><br>  I wondered if it was possible to reproduce CRM in a wholesale company.  It turned out possible, and all the settings took me a few hours. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First of all, the ‚ÄúCustomer Relationship Management‚Äù section was set up. Its client details were configured in the client card (life cycle stage, general information, etc.). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/0f0/ab6/946/0f0ab6946aaa401bb9d26ab43583518a.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Then the section ‚ÄúAssortment line‚Äù was created, in which there is information about the structure of customer consumption in the context of product groups. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/ff5/47e/4f6/ff547e4f622649c7ada4ded9fbc74c77.png"><br><br>  In the "Brands" section there is information about the customer consumption structure by brand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/58c/e4a/f92/58ce4af921a04b24ad4ab5bb2f1e2bbf.png"><br>  The sections ‚ÄúHistory of Work‚Äù and ‚ÄúContacts‚Äù are standard for any CRM, I just formed a set of required fields. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/1a4/d54/80d/1a4d5480dee64402bb7aa5bdbf58f934.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/f7e/56b/5e6/f7e56b5e6e5a408097d28564fe023df0.png"><br><br>  In the section "Our competitors" is information about the threats to individual product groups and brands of the company. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/728/2ec/982/7282ec9824e6481b9650b6d510d43c79.png"><br><br>  Information on goals for the current month in terms of brands and product groups is entered in the ‚ÄúSales Plan‚Äù section. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/6e1/afd/32d/6e1afd32d0a04ab4aa4f0e53e6314c9f.png"><br><br>  On the ‚ÄúSales Facts‚Äù tab, information about actual sales is aggregated based on the delivery schedule. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/a2f/9b9/1f3/a2f9b91f329442cebde7dff7e13d8119.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/0ed/2b8/d16/0ed2b8d167ff4e03aab3e099cb706701.png"><br><br>  I set up the sales funnel as a subordinate to the customer, but it can be completely arbitrary. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/60b/572/a02/60b572a027e6461587474473efea93fb.png"><br><br>  Information on the tabs "Actual sales", "Brands", "Assortment line", "Sales plan" is aggregated at the level of customer groups.  Thus, it is possible to navigate through the levels of the client hierarchy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/299/bc9/1fc/299bc91fcaf2447c88384a47f8eedfe0.png"><br><br>  In my opinion, an interesting feature of Advanta is the possibility of creating discussions, approving documents among company employees in relation to the objects of management (customers, assortment, etc.). <br><br>  After the customer model was set up, it was the turn of brands and product groups. <br><br>  Communication with consumers one way or another relate to the range and brands.  Therefore, it is necessary to keep in view of managers information about sales plans for product groups and brands. <br><br>  At the level of commercial director, it is necessary to plan growth points and avoid erosion of sales between them, use this information as a basis for making management decisions. <br>  When creating a model, there was the problem of choosing the top level of the hierarchy.  As a result, brands were chosen as it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/525/f24/a6f/525f24a6fb744162bbf257332562c9a7.png"><br><br>  I recognized the assortment groups as being too blurred, their borders may fluctuate (for example, from the level of VAZ 2108 shock absorbers to VAZ shock absorbers) depending on the brand.  Therefore, for this example of designer customization, the assortment has been decomposed within each brand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/f07/e48/7e7/f07e487e789548c286740037ad5d1e62.png"><br><br>  Sample brand card. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e64/1ab/291/e641ab2916e74feda5d328c1f9d625ba.png"><br><br>  For each brand, it is possible to create / link deals, establish links with priority segments.  Within each brand are highlighted suppliers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/883/7c0/65c/8837c065ca4f4b029aa8947123c89c23.png"><br><br>  For each supplier, the section "Financial Management" is highlighted. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/002/c09/e17/002c09e17e944321a6fd7b5ba0314c86.png"><br><br>  For the connection of sections, customers and brands / assortment within the section of brands, it is possible to create tasks, connecting them with customers, segments and specific performers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/d23/bb1/8ca/d23bb18cacaa47eebe7a258fe12f436e.png"><br><br>  An important feature of Advanta is that the system allows you to customize reports and their visualization, linking objects and their details, including using OLAP cubes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/5ca/e46/e79/5cae46e791264a2aa11b97f1ddb0621f.png"><br><br>  As a result, after creating a wholesale company management model, I realized that Advanta is quite an option for quick implementation. <br><br>  It is possible to implement all four management functions. <br>  Planning - through setting tasks in the context of employees, customers, brands and product groups <br>  Organization - discussion of work issues with the help of Discussion Tools, Coordination of documents and assignment of performers to tasks. <br>  Motivation and control - through visualization of the progress in achieving goals, calculating indicators and KPI. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/331114/">https://habr.com/ru/post/331114/</a></p>
