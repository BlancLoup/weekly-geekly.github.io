We sincerely wanted to reduce the time spent in the mail, but did not find any option to automate the filling and payment of forms online. <br><br>  Having implemented the basic functionality on the knee, we shared it with the closest people.  Quickly receiving feedback and a ‚Äúgolden post‚Äù in a non-existent blozhik, they finished off a personal account with templates and implemented an API. <br><br>  In the end, the project so quickly got to the top of the main requests and began to grow, that a month later <i>we presented him in the office of the deputy director of IT at Russian Post</i> , and later received consulting from Peter Didenko himself!

      Below, I‚Äôll be happy to tell you some secrets: what the <a href="http://pbrf.ru/">postal</a> blanc. The Russian <a href="http://pbrf.ru/">Federation</a> is, what we started to earn, what difficulties we faced and where we are going to come to in the end. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6d4/93f/7c0/6d493f7c04ce2805c4c6524376c2fba7.png"><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Currently, <a href="http://pbrf.ru/">pbrf.ru</a> is the easiest and most convenient way to fill in the mail forms of Russian Post online.  Upon agreement with postal operators, we will enable the option to pay for shipments online. <br><br>  Since the start of the project, more than 100 users have registered. <br>  <i>For 3 months, 3400+ forms were printed</i> , with the main increase in the last month. <br>  As usual, 80% of printouts are made by 20% of the forms. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/58c/c42/511/58cc425114e0cb4baa426a60d7aa831f.png"><br><br><h5>  About tariffs </h5>  We left the opportunity for everyone to fill out and print forms <b>for free</b> . <br>  The main income channel is online stores, which are Russian mail clients.  They should devote more time to their favorite business, and not to bureaucratic questions in the form of correctness of the entered data and the choice of the necessary forms.  From now on, this is not their problem. <br><br>  <b>We are happy to provide an account with all the features for free to the habrausers for the required amount of time.</b>  <b>It is enough just to drop my login to me in a personal, and the required tariff will be activated within 24 hours.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/36b/a26/922/36ba26922fd1b53982af9902d014818c.png"><br><br>  Currently, a module for Simpla CMS is implemented.  Over the spring, add at least Bitrix, ECWID, Drupal. <br><br>  The data in the field, of course, is automatically substituted immediately after the payment status is changed to ‚ÄúPaid‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/faf/474/834/faf4748345098000d301ebb383381b61.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/44d/6cd/068/44d6cd0680b5d6a3a9cfdba18d94f966.png"><br><br><h5>  RF domain and pass to the top. </h5>  I will share a little secret for all who still have not bought the domain of the Russian Federation for their projects.  If you have the opportunity, be sure to buy one with the target high-frequency occurrence of your request.  If multiple requests - buy multiple domains.  Thanks to our RF domain, we got to the top without any problems in just a month. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/56f/fc0/6fb/56ffc06fbee5257302fbc79165b63026.png"><br><br>  Our ideal is to get a license from the post office in Russia and give everyone the opportunity to pay for shipments online.  Now it is impossible to do this for many reasons, which are not subject to publicity.  But everyone is trying and putting maximum effort to implement his plan, believe me). <br><br><h5>  How do we improve the PBRF? </h5><ul><li>  What to choose - chronopay, assistant or robocassa? </li><li>  How can we find and connect all the stores working with Russian Post? </li><li>  Does the fare include payment for printouts of each form? </li></ul><br>  We would like to receive answers to these questions from you.  Feel free to write our cons objectively.  We will do the maximum to improve ourselves and the project. A low bow to everyone who has paid attention to this post.  We sincerely hope for your bright support! <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/173745/">https://habr.com/ru/post/173745/</a></p>
