  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What does Apple Watch: a year later</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  <i>according to The New York Times</i> </p><br><p>  Just over a year ago, Apple Watch sales started.  Over the past few months, a huge number of reviews of the new apple device have been released, and yet for many it still remains a mystery what Apple Watch can do. </p><br><p>  To a large extent, the usefulness of Apple Watch is determined by the applications available to them.  From this point of view, the picture is quite rosy - the list of applications for watches is growing rapidly. <a name="habracut"></a>  Here are some of the most successful ones: </p><br><p><img src="http://imageshack.com/a/img921/1588/n9S8Oq.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <em>The Facer app shows a different wallpaper on the screen every time you look at the clock.</em> </p><br><p>  ‚ÄúThe simpler, the better,‚Äù says <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/e/kit_eaton/index.html">Keith Eaton</a> , columnist for <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/07/technology/personaltech/what-the-apple-watch-does-one-year-later.html">The New York Times</a> .  His favorite Apple Watch <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/facer-watch-faces-customization/id1057071179">app</a> is called <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/facer-watch-faces-customization/id1057071179">Facer</a> , and it does one single thing ‚Äî it shows a different wallpaper every time you look at a watch.  It would seem to be nothing special and even more useful, however, after installing Facer, it becomes much more pleasant to use the clock.  I want to raise my hand with the clock again and again to see which picture they will show this time.  Facer does not let us forget that we are facing the present offspring of technologies of the 21st century - a watch that looks different every time. </p><br><p>  Of course, Facer has its limitations for watches.  The main thing from them is that you are tied to one design of the clock screen, the simplest one available, which shows only the background and time.  This means that you will not see other elements, such as weather and warnings, available in other screen designs.  In addition, for some pictures have to pay - and they cost $ 1 and up. </p><br><p>  The most useful application for watches according to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/07/technology/personaltech/what-the-apple-watch-does-one-year-later.html">The New York Times</a> is <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/grocery-shopping-list-free/id491297400">Buy a loaf!</a>  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/grocery-shopping-list-free/id491297400">Convenient shopping list</a> that works on the clock and on the iPhone. </p><br><p><img src="http://imageshack.com/a/img924/125/O2SbRc.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <em>Shopping List ‚ÄúBuy a loaf!‚Äù Allows you to synchronize purchases and makes going to the store easier and more pleasant.</em> </p><br><p>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe application is that when you make a shopping list before you go to the store, you use the application on the iPhone.  With ‚ÄúBuy a loaf!‚Äù It is very easy to do this, because the application has a dictionary of the most popular products, plus you can add new products to the lists.  Products can be assigned one or another color (for example, each color may correspond to a particular store department), and the application will group them by color.  There can be several lists, and each of them can be shared with other people. </p><br><p>  The turn of the clock comes when you come to the store.  You do not need to get the phone every time to check the list - just raise your hand with the clock, and it is fantastically convenient.  To cross out the purchased product, just touch it with your finger on the clock.  And if you suddenly remembered that you need to buy something else, you can add the product to the list right on your watch with voice input. </p><br><p>  This convenient and clear application has a free version (of course, in a somewhat truncated version and with advertising).  Similar functions have another free application <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/bring!-shopping-list/id580669177">Bring!</a>  with icon graphics and a slightly more modern interface.  It is very good, but "Buy a loaf!" Easier and more enjoyable. </p><br><p>  The clock is very convenient to use as a fitness tracker and a physical condition monitoring tool, especially with the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/heartwatch.-view-get-notified/id1062745479">HeartWatch</a> app for 229 rubles.  The application shows the current pulse, as well as the average, minimum and maximum values ‚Äã‚Äãof the pulse for the day. </p><br><p>  One glance at the clock is enough to understand whether the heart is coping with stress during cardiovascular exercises.  With Force Touch ‚Äî a strong tap on the screen ‚Äî you can add a note about today's pulse, or add a measurement result to Apple‚Äôs standard Health app, which also contains information about weight, body temperature, etc. </p><br><p>  The companion application for the iPhone is also convenient and informative - it collects detailed statistics on heart health and is presented in a very clear and descriptive form.  In addition, the application allows you to monitor the duration and quality of sleep. </p><br><p>  However, the best sleep tracker is the free <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/sleep%2B%2B/id1038440371">Sleep ++</a> app.  With the help of Apple Watch, it tracks all your movements during the night and shows how restless you are sleeping. </p><br><p>  The application has one button to enable sleep detection mode, in which the application counts how much you actually overslept.  Sleep mode is also disabled with one button, after which the application shows sleep statistics.  Companion application for the iPhone shows detailed information about the phases of sleep. </p><br><p>  The only drawback of this application is that you have to sleep in a clock, which is not always convenient. </p><br><p>  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/cycles-period-tracker-fertility/id577187307">Cycles</a> is another useful free application for women, with which it is very convenient to follow the menstrual cycle.  The companion app for the iPhone allows you to make journal entries and customize alerts. </p><br><p><img src="http://imageshack.com/a/img924/3183/es8rlE.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <em>Weather Underground application.</em> </p><br><p><img src="http://imageshack.com/a/img923/2543/nJy7RU.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <em>Meetup is an application that allows you to find people with similar interests near you.</em> </p><br><p><img src="http://imageshack.com/a/img921/3460/ldKGBm.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <em>The Glyphica app is a text based adventure game.</em> </p><br><p>  Finally, it is worth noting a very beautifully drawn <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/weather-underground-forecasts/id486154808">Weather Underground</a> application, which is much more interesting than Apple's built-in Weather;  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/meetup-groups-near-you-that/id375990038">Meetup</a> application that allows you to find people with similar interests near you and negotiate a joint pastime;  and the same text adventure game <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/glyphica/id1032915484">Glyphica</a> , which can be played right on the clock.  What is especially nice, all these applications are distributed free of charge. </p></div>
