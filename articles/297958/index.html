We decided to tell you about why your potential employer or HR should know how you spend your free time.  And how to make your hobby make your resume more efficient.  So! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f53/a9e/21b/f53a9e21bc7341b2b8ff9c90d90f251f.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  None of us (almost) like being presented to friends, saying something like ‚Äúthis is Olesya, smm-shchik‚Äù.  Olesya, of course, can and works with social networks, only in life she prefers to play the role of Olesya, who has two higher educations, a lot of plans for the future, a family, a dog, and also draws excellently.

      Just unfair to introduce her friends Olesya-smm-shchitsy, agree.  In the summary, as in life, you should show not only your professional experience, but also your personal characteristics.  And the easiest way (believe me!) Is to do this with the help of a hobby - no pompous words about yourself, but just a description of activities that are close to you. <br><br>  HR will look for your personal qualities in your hobbies that allow you to be a good employee and who say that you are a great fit for this position.  So do not rush to talk about how you like to spend all the money on shopping.  Hobbies are different :) So, what does your hobby say about you to your employer? <br><br>  By the way, <a href="http://icanchoose.ru/resume">in our resume designer</a> you can add a hobby and tell about them. <br><br>  <b>// You are a team player</b> <br><br>  If you play sports, you are a member of a football / volleyball / hockey, etc.  team, then, of course, it speaks of you as a person who knows how to work in a team.  Participation in volunteer projects, teaching in circles - all this in the same piggy bank.  Almost every position today involves the ability to be part of a team and even take a leadership role at some point. <br><br>  <b>// You can be a leader</b> <br><br>  If you have had teaching experience or you, for example, are organizing hiking trips for friends, organizing intellectual games or ... gathering everyone to play mafia, it seems that you definitely have the makings of a leader.  And a manager who cares.  You definitely will not remain in the shadows, and people will reach for you.  And HR understands this. <br><br>  <b>// You are good at what you do.</b> <br><br>  For many years, doing something one and trying to constantly improve their skills?  This is just great.  Even better, if you have succeeded in your hobby - whether it be dancing, cross-stitching or cooking cheesecakes.  Perseverance in self-improvement is something that many lack.  This quality you can show in the workplace. <br><br>  / This kind of information can also be indicated in the summary in the section ‚Äúabout yourself‚Äù, if there are achievements that you want to share, such as what you are.  or awarded any prize / <br><br>  <b>// You value time</b> <br><br>  HR managers are well aware that an employee who is focused on his business 24/7 is not the best option.  It is interesting to work with those who are diversified, who see the balance between improvement in the career and personal plan, and not only seek to get promoted.  The ability to manage your time, as well as to distribute your goals and objectives, weigh values ‚Äã‚Äã- if you are a passionate and organized person, then you definitely succeed.  And a hobby helps you with this. <br><br>  <b>// Are you really sociable</b> <br><br>  The ability to communicate with completely different people is an excellent skill.  Simplicity in building communication with representatives of different professions, nationalities, interests can be incredibly useful to you in your work.  If you study languages, work with children or lead a circle in your free time, or maybe ... just learn something that has nothing to do with work (you got into astronomy and became a free listener somewhere, for example), - PR, marketing, yes all services and departments will take you!  :) <br><br>  <b>// Or you are closed</b> <br><br>  We are all different.  And you need to take this into account.  If, for example, you write poetry, like to read books, you can work on something with concentration, then this can also be your strength.  You do not need outside intervention in the work. <br><br>  <b>// Do you know how to handle pressure</b> <br><br>  Fans of playing chess, for example, will understand exactly what we mean!  It is here, playing, sometimes you have to cope with incredible pressure.  And then in the head should be distributed unique moves, combinations ... wow!  In fact, to be honest, fans of computer games (which, by the way, can significantly affect IQ), also cope well with stress. <br><br>  <b>// You are a passionate person</b> <br><br>  In the end, we all strive to love what we do.  If you managed to find a case that you are talking about with burning eyes, that's fine.  And it can be seen immediately.  And there is excitement in you.  And therefore you will try to do everything better than anyone! <br><br>  <b>// You can solve problems</b> <br><br>  Do you like to take pictures / draw?  This suggests that you can look at the object in different ways.  Change the lens.  Make different photos and choose the best.  You consider the details.  Perhaps at work, you too will be able to creatively address the issue and you will be the very person who sees the task from a different angle.  Wow! <br><br>  <b>// you see more in front of you</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúI'm too busy to do anything other than work‚Äù <br><br>  Red light. <br><br>  You can be any hardworking, but must respect yourself.  You do not end where the name of your position in the company begins.  Look for yourself, your talents and then, believe me, everything at work will also take shape differently. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297958/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297958/</a></p>
