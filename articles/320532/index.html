A solution that is already fully competitive in the market. <br><br>  <strong>1. Skins</strong> <br><br>  Monstroid 2 offers <strong>10</strong> designs <strong>out of the box</strong> (one original default theme that can be seen on the Demo page <strong>and 9 more skins</strong> ). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ce9/737/4fa/ce97374fabe041f59303ccac69ba2d54.png"><br><br>  These 9 skins cover all the most important industry niches: <strong>Business, Restaurants, Furniture, Construction, Fitness, Hotels, Investments, Law, Fashion and Entertainment Magazines.</strong> <br><br>  Monstroid 2 set the bar high without exaggeration.  If you look at each template in detail, they are truly masterpiece. <br><br>  In this case, X Theme can respond with 4 main stacks (separate topics), one of which is Ethos with 10 Demo.  However, currently only 3 of 10 Demo are released. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/545/3dc/a32/5453dca325824a7d8351708f4ec589c4.png"><br><br>  <strong>2. The number of sites on one template</strong> <br><br>  Multipurpose template assumes its use on the number of sites on which you need.  Monstroid 2 did not step away from this rule.  Released under <strong>the GPL 3.0 license</strong> , the template allows you to create an unlimited number of sites on your base. <br><br>  This type of license is convenient in that Monstroid 2 itself will be developed, offering its owners all new skins and updates.  Lifetime subscription for a one-time payment, not bad? <br><br>  And what about X Theme?  The theme is sold under the usual license, which gives the right to use the solution for only one project.  Want more - pay. <br><br>  <strong>3. Installation</strong> <br><br>  Immediately after the activation of Monstroid 2, the user is given the opportunity to install the template using the TM Wizard plugin. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8e9/f58/99c/8e9f5899c63041b0b28b4577a0ec2993.png"><br><br>  This great tool will guide you through the installation process.  Is logical.  Simply.  Quickly. <br><br>  <strong>The choice of design and installation</strong> <br><br>  Each skin has demo content and a set of plug-ins.  Depending on the choice of design, the installation wizard will install the necessary set of plug-ins and demo pages. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dea/f60/d94/deaf60d940ab42cda2a036d50b885fcf.png"><br><br>  <strong>Installing plugins</strong> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e64/86a/014/e6486a014aee49129f35805ca172367f.png"><br><br>  X Theme also boasts a quick and easy installation process.  The most common WordPress user will not have any problems installing demo content. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/170/08a/425/17008a42543543a582ea565d4eb990b2.png"><br><br>  <strong>4.

GPL license</strong> <br><br>  You know what's really cool?  <strong>GPL topics</strong> !  And, fortunately, both themes are sold under the GPL.  For those who do not know, this means that when you buy any of these multifunctional themes, you can use it as many times as you like.  Create as many sites as you want.  This is creative freedom, friends, enjoy! <br><br>  Both <strong>Monstroid 2</strong> and <strong>Divi</strong> can be used on all sites you own and are just about to create.  You do not have to pay every time you want to start a new project. <br><br>  <strong>2. Magic?</strong>  <strong>Come on!</strong> <br><br>  The installation wizard is the cornerstone.  Someone adds this opportunity, some do not.  However, letting the client ‚Äúinto the forest without a card‚Äù is bad. <br><br>  That is why <strong>Monstroid 2</strong> has its own installation wizard to help you customize the template.  You can choose the skin and demo data to install, and then go and have a cup of coffee. <br><br>  Divi does not offer any additional tools for installation.  But as soon as you install the template, you see a control panel where you can customize settings.  Further Divi will work according to these settings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/50e/d30/300/50ed303003e547bc98928d34bee84621.png"><br><br>  The only time Divi doesn‚Äôt have an installation wizard, it‚Äôs not so easy for the user to change skins.  You have to open the designer and edit each page by selecting the pre-loaded layout. <br><br>  <strong>3. How much does it cost</strong> <br><br>  To start using Monstroid 2, you only have to pay once.  The price of this topic is $ 75.  After payment of your order, you can use it as many times as you want. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d74/184/8bc/d741848bc6434356b80087eed2617c8f.png"><br><br>  Divi also offers the ability to create as many sites as you want.  And this is understandable, both themes are licensed by the GPL. <br><br>  But there is one problem: Divi is sold with an annual subscription condition, and in order to continue using it, you will have to deposit a certain amount of money once a year. <br><br>  <strong>Divi Developer offers 3 different plans, but there is also a nuance:</strong> <br><br>  1. If you decide to pay $ 69 per year, you will not receive premium plug-ins and multi-layer Photoshop files. <br>  2. If you choose a developer version for $ 89, you will have to pay this amount once a year. <br>  3. If you want to pay it only once, you can choose the plan ‚Äúwith lifelong access‚Äù, then its price will be $ 249 (!). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/955/e97/cdb/955e97cdbe2043ddabda0f5c47f2c328.png"><br><br>  <strong>4. Skins</strong> <br><br>  As of today, Monstroid 2 offers <strong>10 completely unique skins</strong> .  Obviously, <a href="https://www.templatemonster.com/ru/">TemplateMonster</a> designers work on quality, not quantity.  And this is, in fact, one of the key advantages of Monstroid 2. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bed/810/5bb/bed8105bb5f349bba10f55e73dc60fb7.png"><br><br>  Divi has a pre-loaded constructor.  There are about 20+ themes in it, new elegant themes can be additionally downloaded from the site. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d99/190/38f/d9919038fd2343e6983d8c2094524239.png"><br><br>  It is also worth noting that if you pay $ 89 per month, you will have access to 88 other elegant topics on the site. <br><br>  <strong>5. Plugins</strong> <br><br>  Thanks to the attraction of the forces of <a href="http://www.cherryframework.com/">Cherry</a> and <a href="http://www.getmotopress.com/">MotoPress</a> , all owners of Monstroid 2 get to their topic more than <strong>20+ plugins</strong> .  They are sure to help create the perfect website, without worrying about the availability of the necessary plug-ins. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/46d/5b0/c6c/46d5b0c6c2e944a3a2899432cb11be4d.png"><br><br>  Divi offers <strong>6 unique premium plugins</strong> along with templates. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/748/13b/27c/74813b27ceb14a328b6076c26cc057e2.png"><br><br>  <strong>6. For those who like to create</strong> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c84/0c6/574/c840c6574f6a4e60a69fa0b5fe9063d2.png"><br><br>  Monstroid 2 has built-in <strong>Power Builder</strong> .  You can customize your site the easiest way possible! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/834/fef/629/834fef629a3a48bf8d20aff2b445d922.png"><br><br>  Divi also provides its customers with a <strong>Divi Constructor</strong> , which is very similar to PowerBuilder.  Without lying, it is also very easy to use!  It also offers a visual designer that will make the setup process even easier. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fdb/dd9/c6d/fdbdd9c6d74b47efa0924031b2d1da50.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f73/2d7/4e1/f732d74e1e3c48ea93d8d75c89121386.png"><br><br>  <strong>7.

Monstroid 2 support service specialists are ready to help clients 24/7 by phone, chat or e-mail.  You just need to choose your communication channel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1d0/6dd/09b/1d06dd09bcbf40fd99a45efbbfa76198.png"><br><br>  All questions on Divi are solved on the developer forum, this is the only way to communicate with the support service at the moment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/367/203/f30/367203f3017642ed82f8fb873ba29656.png"><br><br>  <strong>8. Documentation</strong> <br><br>  People finally realized the importance of documentation.  Your project may look very cool, but only having good documentation takes it to another level. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7d0/f5f/e2c/7d0f5fe2c4c847b1a098d8c4c5a26fc3.png"><br><br>  Monstroid 2 and Divi provide links to documentation, so that clients should have no problems with working with template customization. <br><br><h2>  Monstroid 2 VS Enfold </h2><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4b8/5d6/82e/4b85d682e5b7449ab911e13f2039db1e.jpg"><br><br>  Enfold is positioned as a universal all-in-one tool for creating a website of any complexity.  The template has powerful technical support and detailed documentation.  It was released back in 2013, but now it already has several updates.  Currently contains 25 child themes. <br><br>  <strong>1. License</strong> <br><br>  Monstroid 2, as already mentioned above, has a GPL license, it gives unimaginable freedom when using it.  You can create an unlimited number of sites, customize them endlessly and even create new pages. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/686/ec3/466/686ec346693144d1beefb29b0c488798.jpg"><br><br>  Enfold is 100% proprietary and can be used to create only one site. <br><br>  <strong>2. Child themes</strong> <br><br>  Monstroid 2 has <strong>9 original designs</strong> , their number will grow.  Monstroid 2 owners will receive new child themes for free. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8b2/eff/edd/8b2effeddfa24a07a9d1f8e82266af82.jpg"><br><br>  Enfold now has <strong>25 child threads</strong> .  Each of them is available in two styles: widescreen and block.  With their help, you can create a website for any niche.  The default theme is universal and suitable for any subject sites. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/029/e9c/2b2/029e9c2b2ae84fa0a4d4bc23cc4b3ad3.jpg"><br><br>  <strong>3. Constructor</strong> <br><br>  Monstroid 2 can be easily customized using <strong>PowerBuilder</strong> , created specifically for the GPL template.  This is a flexible tool with unsurpassed features: it comes with a set of pre-made modules and content blocks that can be useful to your site during the setup process.  Drag-and-drop functionality is also present. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/268/989/3f5/2689893f5a1e473fb4edb3d6a4892f1c.jpg"><br><br>  Improved <strong>Live Customizer</strong> allows you to change the color scheme, modify the layout of your site, its typography and widget area. <br><br>  The Enfold template implements its own <strong>Drag &amp; Drop</strong> Template <strong>Designer</strong> .  It gives you the opportunity to use on the site components: buttons, sliders, accordions, reviews and more.  You can choose from an unlimited number of colors for the site. <br><br>  <strong>4. Framework</strong> <br><br>  Monstroid 2 is based on the <a href="http://www.cherryframework.com/">Cherry Framework 5</a> platform.  If you are accustomed to the flexibility of sites, then this solution is what you need. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5ea/81b/767/5ea81b76760e46ab98665e8ab565467c.jpg"><br><br>  Enfold is not based on any frameworks. <br><br>  <strong>5. Plugin support</strong> <br><br>  The plugins used in detail in Monstroid 2 are described above.  What boasts Enfold? <br>  In addition to common features such as WPML support and SEO optimization, Enfold offers compatibility with the most famous WordPress plugins.  As you can see, this topic does not include many additional extensions, but nevertheless it is strong and reliable. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <strong>WooCommerce</strong> <br>  You can create an online store using this template. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <strong>BuddyPress and bbPress</strong> <br>  These plugins are supported, but not tied to pre-designed pages.  You can use them if you want, but be aware that your social integration will most likely not be perfect. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <strong>EventsCalendar</strong> <br>  EventsCalendar and EventsCalendarPro are included as third-party plug-ins.  They greatly enhance the basic functionality of Enfold. <br><br><h2>  Monstroid 2 VS Avada 5.0 </h2><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b9d/915/70a/b9d91570a32f42e9b5742779f0f92a2c.jpg"><br><br>  Avada 5.0 is the latest version of the best selling WordPress template.  280 thousand sales, this is not a joke. <br><br>  <strong>1. License</strong> <br><br>  Avada is a proprietary template with a single site license.  This means that after creating one site for each next project, you will need to acquire new copies of this topic.  However, this is not a problem if you plan to develop a website for yourself or your business: in this case, you don‚Äôt even need so many design options.  But, creating websites for your clients, you need to pay $ 60 for each such project. <br><br>  <strong>2. Installation</strong> <br><br>  These two templates can be used for your site in different ways.  Each of them has its own installation tool, which gives more opportunities to create a website from scratch. <br><br>  In the case of Monstroid 2 there are such options: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Automatic installation using TM Wizard; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Direct installation by downloading the archive with the theme to your server. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/45a/95e/3ec/45a95e3ecbff4bac8844fa6ee8b79e4f.jpg"><br><br>  If you consider yourself an experienced developer, it is better to install Monstroid 2 manually, simply by downloading the .ZIP file with the template to your server and activating it on the panel of your WordPress. <br>  Depending on the desired functionality of the future site, you can choose between the Lite and Full installation options available through the use of TM Wizard. <br><br>  If you select <strong>Lite</strong> , only the base components are installed.  ECommerce features and non-Cherry based plugins will not be available.  Your Lite version can be updated by adding new plugins via content import. <br><br>  <strong>Full</strong> installation includes the entire array of extensions, it is better suited for virtual dedicated servers (VPS) and other types of premium-level hosting. <br><br>  Avada is no less easy to install: all you need to do is go to the <strong>Appearance ‚Üí Themes</strong> tab and upload the theme to your WordPress site, then install the necessary plugins. <br><br>  <strong>3. Customization and fine tuning</strong> <br><br>  Monstroid 2 not only fully supports WordPress <strong>Live Customizer</strong> , but also adds a lot of additional features.  With it, you can change the <a href="https://www.templatemonster.com/ru/">design of the site</a> element by element, easily and precisely adjust the color scheme and even save your design experiments as ready-to-use skins.  Each skin offers a choice of several options heder, footer and side panels. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/381/ce7/ad9/381ce7ad944e492e873b34a2968a4283.jpg"><br><br>  The Avada template is often praised for the flexibility and abundance of personalization options.  As in any other modern WordPress solution, its latest version is compatible with <strong>Live Customizer</strong> and allows you to change any element of your site at your own discretion. <br><br>  <strong>4. Constructor</strong> <br><br>  Monstroid 2 has <strong>Power Builder</strong> , and Avada runs on the latest version of Fusion Builder, an optimized Drag &amp; Drop page builder.  The template interacts with <strong>Fusion Theme Options and Fusion Page Options</strong> and is able to modify both the appearance of the site and its content. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2b0/828/d42/2b0828d426514c958299d6e8170273c9.jpg"><br><br>  <strong>5. Ready templates</strong> <br><br>  Instead of classic child themes, Avada has <strong>22 demo versions</strong> , and Monstroid 2 has <strong>10 skins</strong> . <br><br>  A complete list of ready-made Monstroid 2 templates available immediately after purchase: <br><br>  <strong>Default</strong> is the basic design of Monstroid 2.
