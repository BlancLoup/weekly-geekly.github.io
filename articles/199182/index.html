  <section class="page js-page"><h1>PCs are not dead, we just do not need new ones.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  When was the last time you bought a new personal computer?  Two years ago?  Three?  The last PC I assembled in 2009. I needed an upgrade, since the previous computer had exhausted its capabilities - after all, it began its life in 2004. By the standards of computers, 2009 is already antiquity, but this is not quite so in terms of computing.  Yes, there are a huge number of new processors on the market and their speed is growing exponentially.  But for me, all benchmarks are just marketing tricks.  PC sales are falling, but this is the wrong indicator to determine the development of technology.  The reason we stopped buying MS is that they are already pretty good. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2da/193/cb2/2da193cb23c17b31222af6a375a434a1.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I have a Dell Inspiron e1505 laptop.  Its screen is broken, but I connect an external monitor.  I started to use it more and more for development.  Please note that this is a 2006 model and even now it works great.  I just upgraded the hard drive to 120G SanDisk SSD and installed Ubuntu 12.04 - and now it boots in less than 15 seconds.  You can say that the tablets are loaded instantly, but this computer is from 2006 and I use it for development and sometimes I watch movies.  I launch a browser with a lot of tabs, my IDE works on it, the code is compiled and I am not worried about its performance.  If such an ancient machine can do so much, what can we expect from a desktop in 2009?

      I recently updated the graphics card to the one that has an HDMI output (I never needed it before).  I connected it to the TV, and the children were able to watch their cartoons on the big screen while I was developing my applications at the same time.  The car barely tenses with all these things running in the background. <br><br>  A personal computer has its drawbacks, it is not portable.  That's all. <br><br>  Of course, PC sales will be low.  When you do not have enough memory, you buy extra.  When the processor is too slow, buy a new or new cooler and overclock the old one.  Very rarely do you need a completely new computer. <br><br>  I quite believe that tablets are amazing devices.  They serve their purpose of ‚Äúeasy‚Äù computing very well.  They are portable and work even longer laptops.  When you work with a tablet, you almost never get the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãadding memory.  But for some reason, after several years of use, you begin to notice that the tablet is getting too slow.  And after that the only possibility will be the purchase of a new model. <br><br>  A properly assembled PC can run for 5 years without any upgrade.  Top smartphones or tablets that are currently on the market will become obsolete by the end of 2014, if not earlier.  My HTC Evo 4G was incredibly fast 2 years ago when I received it.  Today I deleted all my applications and left only a cellular connection to receive messages.  I desperately need a new phone, because now I have only 80 MB of internal memory.  Of course, I‚Äôll buy a new one and it will add lovely + 1 to all increasing sales of mobile devices. <br><br>  Let's stop pretending that this is the current state of the industry: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/243/186/58c/24318658cef031fd7e69c472bcd2c63a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  PC manufacturers and retailers will find it difficult to convince people of the need to buy new computers, as they simply change the packaging.  This does not mean that the RS will slowly disappear.  Just buy new computers will be only those who really need them.  And, actually, that was exactly what was intended. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/199182/">https://habr.com/ru/post/199182/</a></p>
