      <b><u>Do not try to re-force yourself, do what you want to do</u></b> . <br><br>  How do you find such a simple and simple idea?  She initially seemed wildly irrational, distressingly evasive and completely indifferent.  Such advice can only be given by a person who is indifferent to my life and my problem.  Next, I will explain what basis I found under this idea, and why it makes so much more sense than it seems.  But first, let's deal with the subject. <br><br><h4>  I have laziness or procrastination? </h4><br>  It is very important to make the correct diagnosis.  The psyche is a serious thing, and you should not act at random.  Fortunately, the procedure of diagnosis is quite simple, the patient is quite able to perform it on their own.  To do this, you need an office with a stove bench.  Better if it is a comfortable bed.  Eliminate extraneous noise: close the windows, escort from the premises of all uncomplicated and onlookers.  Dim the lights: turn off the lights, cover the blinds and curtains on the windows.  Now lie down.  If it is cool, it is advisable to take cover with a blanket or blanket.  For complete immersion in the procedure, you can close your eyes.  All is ready?  Now you need to do the following.  Think of some important business that you need to do, but you somehow take it easy.  Think about how you need to do it, what exactly your actions will be.  Try to be relaxed.  Let thoughts flow freely and at ease.  After 15 minutes, analyze what happened to you during the procedure. <br><br>  So, we make a diagnosis.  If during the entire procedure you experienced nervousness, accompanied by increased sweating and rapid heartbeat - most likely you have procrastination.  And if after 15 minutes you find yourself sleeping peacefully - probably you are just lazy.  In the case, if you prefer to use more rational actions, such as throwing at the office, pulling out hair, punching the wall with your head, etc., you should know that you are not our patient.  But in any case, do not worry and do not panic, dial 103 on the phone and try to articulate the essence of the case from which you take a shirk.  And finally, if you have fallen into a lethargic sleep, we are sorry for you, but at the moment we cannot help.  Wait, someone will find you. <br><br><h4>  And what to do now? </h4><br>  If you are still with us, then it's time to think about treatment.  There are many widely publicized drugs to suppress this disease.  You can ‚Äúeat a frog‚Äù in the morning on an empty stomach (perform the most unpleasant thing first), carry out daily inhalations with formaldehydes (take walks in the park), do physical therapy (train a muscle of the will starting from small weights), or even turn to alternative medicine (for example, do yoga).  All this is an incredibly interesting pastime by itself, but it has very little effectiveness with respect to our problem.  To cure a disease, it is necessary to understand its causes. <br><br>  During the diagnosis, without knowing it, we have already eliminated the mental and physiological problem.  If you are not sure, just in case, additionally check with the therapist and psychiatrist.  Do not talk about the purpose of checking the latter, since  By this you can provoke an incorrect diagnosis with all the consequences.  Psychiatrists are strange and dumb people, beware of them.  Further, we will assume that you are physically healthy, and, therefore, the problem has an exclusively psychological basis. <br><br>  From the point of view of psychology, motives are the cause of human actions.  Motivation is based on needs and fueled by a reward system.  When climbing Maslow's pyramid, the blood pressure of dopamine rises, which leads to an increase in the concentration of the liver in the blood.  Simply put, psychologists say that if you do not do something, then you simply do not want to do it.  O-pa, unexpected, right?  I already hear exclamations of indignation, they say, how I don‚Äôt want it, if I know what I want.  That's how!  Do not want - and all.  Scientifically, your motivation is insufficient.  And to put it simply - unwillingness outweighs desire. <br><br>  This moment, perhaps, is the biggest obstacle to the elimination of the problem.  To solve a problem, you need to recognize it.  You can easily recognize a pimple on the nose.  But how to recognize unobvious, or even unthinkable?  How is it possible that a person, clearly aware of all the delights of owning a car and apartment, exciting trips abroad, making repairs and building all his dreams, walking around restaurants, theaters and other things, other things ... most of all, eager to score on his work ?  Unimaginable, incomprehensible.  Too stupid to be true! <br><br>  I want to remind you that if you reasonably consider yourself a healthy person, then logic should prevent you from blaming everything on physiological or mental problems.  If you really think that the awl in one place prevents you from sitting down, then I strongly recommend you to think about turning to a therapist or psychiatrist.  If you are completely confident that you are completely healthy, and in no other activity other than the work of such symptoms are observed, then it should be recognized that there can be no other reason for shirking except for the lack of sufficient desire. <br><br><h4>  How to treat? </h4><br>  It is clear that all this does not sound very convincing, and almost unfounded.  Looking for facts!  And you get them.  You just need patience, attentiveness and ... courage.  I am sure that over time you will learn to see the reverse sides of all benefits, and the likelihood of failures on the way to their achievements, a lot more interesting.  All this you will get from your life, now we will return to the problem itself.  Although the problem is not a disease in the psychophysiological sense, from the point of view of psychology, this is quite a worthy problem requiring attention and, we can say (with a stretch), treatment. <br><br>  Psychology is not a science in the strict sense of the word, because  explores mostly intangible concepts that exist only in verbal form and in the form of an idea.  Since we concluded that our ailment is psychological, we will be treating him with an extremely kind word.  And do not worry about the effectiveness of this method.  At a minimum, you can count on a placebo effect, a typical level of effectiveness of which is 5-10%, which is not so bad.  But history shows that the word has much more power, so let us drop doubts. <br><br><h5>  Idea # 0: ideas are our pills </h5><br>  Man is a rational being, and in his actions depends largely on his (ideally) inferences.  If their own conclusions do not help, it will not be shameful to turn to ideas from the outside.  I will try to convey these ideas, and the word will be the carrier.  You also, for the successful adoption of the message, you need to focus primarily on the next thought.  Since the problem is not physiological, but psychological, the only action that can fix it is a thought process.  No frogs for breakfast here will help.  Only conclusions can change your desire and behavior (psychotropic substances are not discussed here - this is a completely different, little-studied story).  To change behavior - change your beliefs. <br><br><h5>  Idea # 1: laziness is not a vice, procrastination is not a disease </h5><br>  Leave this approach to doctors.  Have you already figured out that your body is healthy?  Then no need to treat yourself like a leper.  And do not break what works.  This, in general, is the main ‚Äúcure‚Äù for procrastination.  As soon as you conclude that there is no disease, the need to treat something disappears immediately.  Procrastination and laziness are just terms symptomatically describing a behavior that someone regards as painful.  However, there is no reason to assert that this is a disease, in our case is not available.  And this means that the idea, and even the terms themselves, in our case, are harmful, if only by the fact that they mislead us. <br><br><h5>  Idea number 2: if I do not do something - then I just do not want </h5><br>  Yes, again.  With this little to accept.  It just needs to be taken.  Say to myself: ‚ÄúI do not want!  and I will not. "That's so simple.  Remember the old Soviet <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DNQEkVCq_SWQ">cartoon about Nechuhuha</a> ?  We must become nehochuhoy.  Probably, neither the grandmother from the cartoon, nor the party that ordered this cartoon, would not be happy with your decision.  However, as long as you deceive yourself, you will spoil your life for yourself.  It should be recognized that all your actions come from desires.  For example, helping a grandmother may come from the desire to be a good person, or not to be censured, or, as in a cartoon, from the fear of losing freedom (a crazy idea, but he is a cartoon).  Unwillingness is the same desire, only the opposite.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to move‚Äù is the same as ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to move‚Äù.  Simply, someone may not like your desires, that's all.  The question is - who exactly?  Wife?  Parents?  Children?  Superiors?  Employees?  Friends?  The second question arising from the first - and what do you lose from this?  Maybe not so much?  Well, not enough to want to do what you do not want to do now?  We must learn to recognize their reluctance, finally and firmly: ‚ÄúI do not want.  At least now.  Maybe tomorrow, or in a month I want, but now - no. ‚Äù <br><br><h5>  Idea number 3: just do what you want to do </h5><br>  People who suffer from not being able to force themselves to work usually spend time on all that nonsense stuff.  Anything, just not to work.  Lazy people are lying around and watching TV, procrastinators are sitting at the computer and watching YouTube - by and large there is no difference how you spend time when you waste it.  In this case, do something else can interfere with the feeling that you are not doing what you need, wasting precious time.  In this way, you will either seek to be close to your work, or you will try to get away from your work and thoughts about it as far as possible.  But in neither case will you do the work.  That makes no sense.  If you foresee that you obviously will not do this work at the moment, inform everyone who depends on you: heads, staff, family members, friends.  Be honest with yourself and with people around you, everyone will benefit from it.  Speak as it is: now I can‚Äôt, for personal reasons, I‚Äôll let you know in a limited amount of time if something has changed.  Of course, you can be fired, you can get a divorce, and the whole life can turn around.  But if everything is so bad, does it really make sense to continue to suffer and wait for someone else to take responsibility for themselves, and then get depressed and engage in self-flagellation?  Do you really want to force yourself all your life, whip yourself with a whip on your back to do work that you do not want to do?  To stop this mess, you need to learn how to make a decision, and voice it to everyone.  As soon as you tell everyone that you will not do anything, the burden of responsibility will drop from you.  And then you can calmly think about what you really want to do right now.  When everyone is up to date - no need to pretend, creating the appearance of work, no need to run, pouring stress into alcohol.  This is freedom: do what you want to do.  It is not necessary to be categorical.  You can at least take a time out and see how it works for you and what will change.  I am sure that in a state of freedom a healthy person will have healthy desires that in no way harm him.  Perhaps some desires are too big and unattainable in a short period of time - then you should concentrate on some smaller desires.  Something must be found.  There can be no way. <br><br><h5>  Idea number 4: self-sacrifice is a bad idea </h5><br>  Many people cannot afford to seriously change anything, because their loved ones depend on them.  And behind this attitude lies a big problem.  I do not mean that you should not save children from the fire by risking your life.  Short-term self-sacrifice can make sense to you.  However, sacrificing your whole life is a really bad idea.  Especially if you have already started to experience problems with a lack of motivation.  Let us leave the reasoning on the meaning of life beyond the scope of this article, and ask ourselves a simpler question: will it become good for your loved ones if you continue to sink into depression?  Will your wife be glad to communicate with you?  Can you put your children on their feet?  Will you be able to stretch a glass of water to your parents?  A person with big problems, in fact, very few people need, and certainly does not bring benefit to anyone.  Is that people with a pathological desire to care about your neighbor.  In a normal situation, you risk bringing an unnecessary sacrifice and being left with nothing. <br><br><h5>  Idea number 5: fears are far-fetched </h5><br>  As they say, fear has big eyes.  Most people even in the worst situation are afraid that if you try to change something, it will get worse.  I would be lying if I said that I don‚Äôt think so.  Yes, there is a high probability that it will become worse.  However, this is unlikely to drag on for a long time.  If you are not your own enemy, you will find a way out.  We live in the 21st century, around a lot of resources and opportunities.  Try to soberly assess the probability that you will die of hunger under some kind of bridge?  In the end, you may elect a box from the refrigerator as your place of residence, but if you are happy about it, then why not?  It is worth noting that the majority of homeless people are mentally ill, among them there are many schizophrenics.  If in doubt - again, it is better to visit a psychiatrist.  And to those who worry that laziness will enslave them, I want to note that many successful people admitted to the extreme degree of laziness.  They allegedly constantly avoid unpleasant work.  But the strange thing: people wonder how they manage to remake so many things! <br><br><h4>  A recipe for laziness attacks: </h4><br>  1) to grow up (physically) <br>  2) take responsibility for your life, <br>  3) have the courage <br>  4) be honest with yourself and others <br>  5) learn to say ‚Äúno‚Äù <br>  6) learn to make a decision <br>  7) do what you want and have fun. <br><br><h4>  PS: </h4><br>  I would be grateful if you would write in the comments if the article helped to sort out the problem and understand how to finally solve it.  Thank :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300500/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300500/</a></p>
