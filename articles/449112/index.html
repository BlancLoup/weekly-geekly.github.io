A large number of audio gadgets have fallen into it, for example, Sony and Apple iPod players.  But today, many of them are already outdated.  We are talking about audio devices, which at one time made a lot of noise. <br><br> <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/audiomania/blog/449112/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dz/fy/p-/dzfyp-ry_k3ylzkardofay7pd8u.jpeg"></a> <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/8e0EHPUx3Mo">Eric Noapnen</a> / Unsplash</i></font> <br><br><h2>  iPod </h2><br>  In late 2001, Apple revolutionized digital music with the release of the iPod.  For a long time, the player remained Apple's flagship product in the mass market - sales of devices grew <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-ipod-rise-fall-chart-2017-7">steadily</a> until 2008.  Later, however, the first iPhone came out, and the corporation's portable player began to "sink."

      The IT giant continued to release updates for its device for a long time.  For example, in 2010, the sixth generation of iPod Nano with a touch screen and the fourth generation of iPod Shuffle weighing only 12 grams.  But the amount of revenue that brought players, continued to decline.  The logical finale of the once successful lines came in 2017, when Apple <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-says-so-long-to-the-ipod-nano-and-ipod-shuffle/">stopped their release</a> .  Then the journalists of large media <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2017/07/28/apples-ipod-nano-shuffle-are-officially-dead-and-it-was-time-for-them-to-go/">noted</a> that, despite its former popularity, the devices could not withstand competition with smartphones and streaming services. <br><br>  The only iPod that has a chance for an update is the Touch.  Apple has not officially announced the closure of this project.  In March of this year, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/03/19/new-ipod-touch-as-early-as-tomorrow/">there</a> were even rumors about the imminent announcement of a new model.  But it is likely that they will remain rumors. <br><br><h2>  Zune </h2><br>  In 2006, Microsoft officially <a href="https://www.silicon.co.uk/mobility/smartphones/tales-tech-history-microsoft-zune-210569">released</a> its response to the iPod - Zune.  However, the product did not manage to find a place in the market.  For the iPod, the status of the iconic audio gadget, which had already occupied three-quarters of the world market by the time Zune was released, would be fixed. <br><br>  Microsoft has not left attempts to keep up with Apple.  In 2007, the corporation released the Zune 80 and smaller versions of the device - the Zune 4 and Zune 8 - in response to the iPod Nano.  A bit later, the Zune HD was introduced.  Critics <a href="https://www.popmatters.com/112482-new-microsoft-zune-hd-is-lovely-but-not-perfect-2496093084.html">praised</a> its design and screen quality.  But all these models remained in the shadow of apple devices. <br><br>  New versions of the Zune came out before the early 2010s.  After that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groove_Music">,</a> music services and digital marketplace of the same name were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groove_Music">formed</a> on their base.  A little later, they all united under the Xbox Music brand and transformed into a music platform (today <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groove_Music">it is called Groove</a> ).  Brand Zune officially ceased to exist. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/y0/lc/jn/y0lcjnidlcrlqpahuqxskeww6uk.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>Photo <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/armydre2008/6860026117">frankieleon</a> / CC BY / Photo changed</i></font> <br><br><h2>  PMP300 </h2><br>  In 1998, Diamond Multimedia released the Rio PMP300 player.  It <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/03/10/ft_first_mp3_player/">is called the</a> first commercial MP3 player.  The memory capacity of the device was only 32 megabytes, but for its time it was a breakthrough.  At the same time, its price was 200 dollars - the first iPod, released three years later, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_Classic">cost</a> twice as much. <br><br>  But the age of this device was short.  Just a month after the release, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) sued the manufacturer PMP300.  The RIAA feared that the distribution of music in digital format will have a negative impact on CD sales and will contribute to the development of piracy.  As a result, the court ordered to stop the production and implementation of the PMP300.  So, Diamond Multimedia has become a victim of the fight against the new format. <br><br>  The company later appealed the ruling, but time was lost.  Total Diamond Multimedia sold about 200 thousand copies of its player. <br><br><h2>  Helix </h2><br>  In 2006, Samsung engaged in the release of Helix.  These were small devices with the function of recording and playback of tracks in MP3 format, broadcast by satellite radio stations.  Although these audio gadgets were not players in the classic sense, they <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/25/technology/25pogue.html">didn‚Äôt avoid</a> comparisons with the iPod at the time. <br><br>  In addition to Samsung, the operator of satellite radio XM Satellite Radio was involved in the development of Helix.  Soon after the release of the device, he had to sue the RIAA on the same occasion as Diamond Multimedia.  The association did not like that users could record songs from the air, thereby creating pirated copies of the tracks. <br><br>  While the courts were passing, smartphones and streaming services became widespread.  As a result, the project Helix also turned.  As for XM Satellite Radio, the company subsequently transformed into an online radio with its own application for smartphones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7_/pn/qp/7_pnqpi-g2wxshdofsd38dd44yg.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>Photo <a href="https://pixabay.com/ru/photos/%25D1%2581%25D0%25BF%25D1%2583%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F-%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0-2801490/">Pixabay</a> / PD</i></font> <br><br><h2>  Chromecast audio </h2><br>  In 2015, Google has a device that turns wired speakers into wireless, - Chromecast Audio.  Users on thematic resources <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/01/30/opinion-an-ode-to-the-chromecast-audio/">noted</a> that this is "a very simple product with a simple function."  The decision was also relatively budget - Chromecast Audio cost $ 35. <br><br>  Earlier this year, Google <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/01/google-kills-the-chromecast-audio/">announced</a> the discontinuation of the audio gadget.  Probably, this decision is due to the fact that the device has lost its relevance.  According to statistics, at the end of 2018, 41% of consumers in the United States <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/28/smart-speakers-hit-critical-mass-in-2018/">owned</a> smart speakers.  And analysts expect that this figure will only increase.  Therefore, the need to connect the old wired speakers gradually disappears, and with it the need for a specialized device like Chromecast. <br><br><h2>  AirPods? </h2><br>  Another popular Apple product is EarPods headphones.  They appeared on the market with the first iPod and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-are-apple-headphones-white-2016-5">became</a> part of an advertising campaign for Apple music devices.  Headphones have successfully experienced a decline in the popularity of digital players.  In 2007, they received a volume control and became an accessory for the iPhone. <br><br>  Over time, the design and functionality of the headphones changed, and the company began to move toward wireless devices.  In 2016, the corporation released the first generation of AirPods.  In two years, they <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/02/12/airpods-second-best-selling-apple-product/">became the</a> second best-selling Apple product (after the iPad).  However, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/03/your-airpods-probably-have-terrible-battery-life/585439/">according to major media</a> , soon this gadget may also become outdated.  But here we are talking about a slightly different form of obsolescence associated with a lack of battery life. <br><br>  According <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/01/28/airpods-battery-life/">to some news portals</a> , AirPods headphones eventually begin to quickly discharge.  The battery life of the device approximately two years after the purchase may be two times less than that declared by the manufacturer.  The existence of the problem is also confirmed by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/airpods/comments/9mcc66/airpod_battery_draining_relatively_quickly/">some Reddit residents</a> . <br><br>  Apple says they knew about the problem and tried to correct the situation in the new version of the headphones - AirPods 2 - they were introduced in March of this year.  Did you correct the deficiency will be seen in the near future. <br><br><hr><br>  <i>Additional reading from our ‚ÄúWorld Hi-Fi‚Äù and Telegram channel:</i> <i><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1o/sf/72/1osf72wkwrjhzpl2bwl5hcmwnbq.png"></i>  <i><a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-6552.html">The history of audio technology: synthesizers and samplers</a></i> <i><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1o/sf/72/1osf72wkwrjhzpl2bwl5hcmwnbq.png"></i>  <i><a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-6529.html">The method of noise isolation, quenching up to 94% of noise - we tell how it works</a></i> <i><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1o/sf/72/1osf72wkwrjhzpl2bwl5hcmwnbq.png"></i>  <i><a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-6499.html">Enthusiast recreated the Sound Blaster 1.0 sound card</a></i> <i><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1o/sf/72/1osf72wkwrjhzpl2bwl5hcmwnbq.png"></i>  <i><a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-6493.html">What is happening in the streaming audio market: discussing the development of streaming platforms</a></i> <i><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1o/sf/72/1osf72wkwrjhzpl2bwl5hcmwnbq.png"></i>  <i><a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-6475.html">Vinyl is back and it's different</a></i> <i><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1o/sf/72/1osf72wkwrjhzpl2bwl5hcmwnbq.png"></i>  <i><a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-6468.html">A selection of online stores with hi-res music</a></i> <i><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1o/sf/72/1osf72wkwrjhzpl2bwl5hcmwnbq.png"></i>  <i><a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-6454.html">Please be quiet - we are talking about the loudest places and sounds in the world</a></i> <i><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png"></i>  <i><a href="https://t.me/audiomaniaRU/736">Artificial Intelligence will be able to train professional violinists.</a></i> <i><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png"></i>  <i><a href="https://t.me/audiomaniaRU/734">Centipedes celebrate anniversary</a></i> <br><br><hr></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/449112/">https://habr.com/ru/post/449112/</a></p>
