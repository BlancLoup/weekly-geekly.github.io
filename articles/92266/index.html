By tradition, at the next job for the IT department was allocated disgusting room.  Despite the fact that it was large and convenient in principle, it had a number of drawbacks.  Somehow - the lack of windows and the fact that the office was passing.  And if it was still possible to put up with the second one, the lack of windows ... and the presence of 4 employees + couriers coming to sit did the air in the room not just stale, but completely devoid of oxygen. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A constantly working air conditioner improved conditions a little - the cold air created the illusion that it was fresh.  But it definitely did not increase the oxygen content, which sometimes led to ... certain mental disorders :) <br><br>  Then one day, when we were sitting in the office during the day, it was still far before lunch and there was nothing to do - a stray glance came across a cardboard dog sitting under the ceiling from a box with a Zyxel modem.  No one remembers how she appeared there - she was there always.

      With the help of a chair, one of the administrators, such-and-such mothers and improvised tools, the dog was removed from the ceiling and subjected to the <s>execution of</s> modernization.  Painted eyes were cut and two bulbs (OSRAM H4) were inserted from the headlights of my car instead.  The neighbor did not work on one of them, so they were replaced, and for some reason they were lying on the table.  :) <br><br>  After that, the dog was installed on the edge of the table, and in front of it was scattered a finely broken disk from the ASUS M2N-E motherboard (what else could a robot dog eat?).  However, the picture was not complete, so the power supply unit was removed from the cushion and the light bulbs were powered at 5 volts in the high-beam mode (they were first powered at 12V, but from such brightness they tried to explode). <br><br>  Unfortunately, due to circumstances, the project did not have time to develop - the plans were to attach a video camera with a motion sensor and a voice module.  Therefore, the dog performed two main functions - it maintained in the office the reputation of the IT department as exceptional <s>dibil of</s> mentally defective personalities and, when turned on, protected our brain during regular visits of our IT director, whose favorite activity was to sit down and generate a stream of consciousness, which apparently from his point of view was gushing brilliant ideas, and with ours - destroyed our brain with its senselessness and unprofessionalism. <br><br>  I hope the dog is still alive and faithfully serving those who replaced us in a difficult post ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/92266/">https://habr.com/ru/post/92266/</a></p>
