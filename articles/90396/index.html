  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Silicone Hills of Russia</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The theme of the construction of the ‚ÄúSilicon Valley‚Äù in the Moscow suburb of Skolkovo is already on the verge of ‚Äúgetting it all‚Äù, but still, I decided to share my experience with Habra, after attending the ‚Äúfirst meeting of the community‚Äù.  IT in the list of priority areas was mentioned in 3 positions (out of 5) with the comment ‚Äúit's impossible not to do this‚Äù.  So‚Ä¶ <br><br><img src="http://i.imagehost.org/0677/26789203_sotnya_holmov.jpg" width="699" height="257" alt="ImageHost.org"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  WTF </h4><br>  Officially, the valley is called ... the valley is called ... no name at all!  The servants of the people did not know or forgot Captain Vrungel, and in fact how would you call a yacht ... Glimpses of phrases like "a separate territorial unit" and other water for filling in reports.  But where have I been then?

    <h5>  Community Futurussia </h5><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://i.imagehost.org/0677/7_28.jpg" width="454" height="399" alt="Futurama" title="Futurama"></div><br><br>  What is it, difficult to explain.  Indeed, it is incredibly difficult to explain what you do not understand yourself.  ‚ÄúYou are 200 people,‚Äù ‚Äúwe make this city for you,‚Äù ‚Äúyou live there, work and grow rich‚Äù - these are Vladovlav Yuryevich Surkov's free quotes - the main one on this project, the first deputy.  the head of the presidential administration. <br>  The organizers did not come up with a single wording regarding the Russian community name and wrote an absolutely miserable ‚Äúfuturussia‚Äù on the screen.  Probably not to burn, although Surkov doesn‚Äôt look like Bender at all.  In speech, of course, everyone used futurash. <br><br>  It turned out like a party 200 young and not very people who have listened to many words, and had to be filled with enthusiasm.  The question from the audience (which was moderated in the form of voting among the other participants) is ‚Äúwhat is our status?‚Äù.  Vladislav Yuryevich seemed to be a rather positive person, so the answer ‚Äúyes, you don‚Äôt have any status‚Äù delivered the audience quite a lot, breaking applause. <br><br><h5>  City of Sun </h5><br>  Here under this name "object" is often mentioned in the press.  Accordingly, the event is a discussion of this city, receiving feedback from the audience (the electorate?). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://i.imagehost.org/0426/51733c3666.jpg" width="216" height="240" alt="Idontknower" title="Idontknower"></div>  . <br><br>  By analogy with the megalopolis in the work of Nikolay Nosov, in the newly-minted Solntsegrad, it is planned to invent circulines, planetarks, tracked motorcycles, spiral rovers, jet roller turbolets and other nanotractors instead of inefficient cars on the syrup.  In general, to move away from raw materials technologies, as the oil economy will not feed you, ‚Äúwe were lucky at one time‚Äù (¬© Surkov). <br><br><h4>  What for </h4><br>  Again, it is not very clear ... It seems that this is what is supposed to be determined by the people.  What to do Kulibin on the innovation zone - whether government orders, or start-ups;  whether they should build a business or be limited to issuing scientific and technical reports;  where to get money from, if we don‚Äôt have venture funds, but it‚Äôs more profitable for business operators to overtake the luminescent car ... <br><br><h4>  Shorthand </h4><br>  The undeclared, but the main participant in the speeches was Captain "Cap" Obvious.  For almost an hour, Surkov spread out the long-known truths about the primitiveness of the commodity economy, technical backwardness, the need for modernization, and Russia (and it was offered to get acquainted with the video version of these speeches in an interview with Vedomosti).  The question of "how", as I understand it, is up to the people-community to decide. <br><br>  After fixing the fact that innovations are inevitable, Vladislav Yuryevich sent the oppositionists to engage in raising the technical level of the country, since ‚Äúwhat kind of economy, is this and power‚Äù, and ‚Äúpower vertical is generally a projection of a gas pipe‚Äù. <br><br>  Then there were the aunt of the American Academy of Sciences and the European type uncle from China.  Since the program of the English-speaking speakers was not stated, far from everyone at the entrance realized that they would receive receivers for synchronic translation (and, indeed, they understood Surkov in the original).  It was amusing to observe how the American guest first looked at the audience listening to her without any intermediaries with obvious surprise, and then, apparently realizing what was going on on the faces of the individual comrades, she said that she would try to speak more slowly.  The Chinese brother discovered the secret of how to become the most innovative country in the world in 30 years (using the example of China) - just believe and love your country (twice).  The second Chinese recipe, probably already Surkov, as the representative of the state, was issued the principle of ‚Äúprotect and grow.‚Äù  I don‚Äôt know if he reached the addressee, Surkov‚Äôs synchronic translation also didn‚Äôt seem to work out. <br><br>  It was stated about the need to attract foreign luminaries of science (‚Äúlure into the perimeter and take away the passport from the professor‚Äù - our underground version), including (certainly!) The Nobel laureates. <br><br>  After these events, the event rolled into the UG, which I recorded in a coated branded notebook: <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://i.imagehost.org/0892/1_119.jpg" width="388" height="215" title="Spherical horse in the outer space" alt="Spherical horse in the outer space"></div><br><br>  At the end of the meeting, all those gathered broke up into groups and debated on the themes of the beautification of the garden city.  On the sidelines agreed that the undertaker and the sheriff are most needed. <br><br><h4>  Instead of conclusion </h4><br>  In general, if you put up with the loss of time (all the same day is working, and time is money) it was interesting, even prolonged.  The idea, of course, is very raw, but the furnace is loaded with money. <br><br>  If you try on rose-colored glasses for a moment, then you really want to see how it will end, maybe, really, Russia, go ahead? <br><br>  PS At the exit, the organizers desperately asked for the return of two receivers for synchronic translation (a total of 9 were issued).  Do you still doubt what the root of all troubles?  :) <br><br>  <b>UPDATE:</b> <br>  <a href="http://www.vesti.ru/videos%3Fvid%3D266653">Video futures report</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/90396/">https://habr.com/ru/post/90396/</a></p>
