  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Is there life on Mars? Ugh! Under Linux?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  All people, after installing Linux, have the same number of questions.  Solving the questions that have appeared to me, I will describe them here, I hope that this will help someone to save their time and nerves. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Once again, when I took the hated creation of small-scale ones, I had an idea ... to put Linux at home as the main and only system.  Some houses put linuha as a second axis and constantly switched back and forth.  This is not our method and I have chosen the path for strong spirit men. <br><br>  My first acquaintance with linux was made thanks to a wonderful general-purpose computer specialist Myachkov Alexander.  We then worked together at the Volgograd brewery "Pivovar" and he gave me a sidyuk with Linux Red Hat 5.0 for me and a book "Linux Reference Book" for my birthday.  At that time, the support for the iron was not very good, so the GUI didn't start right away on my vidyuhi.  Neither desire nor qualification was enough for me at that time, so my communication was limited to the command line, but it was short-lived.  I began to study computers from DOS, so the console did not particularly scare me, I decided to be patient.  I missed the 6th version of the red cap, bought 7.0 at once and fully enjoyed the charms of the gays.  Since then, the following unixes have been tested: Linux Red Hat 5.0, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 8.0, 9.0, Linux Red Hat Advanced Server 3-4, Linux Fedora Core 4.0-8.0, Linux Suse 8.0, Linux Mandriva 2007, Linux Slackware (I don‚Äôt remember the version), Alt Linux 9.0, Sco Unix 5.0.5, Sun Solaris 5.0.  As you can see, the list is quite large, but I do not consider myself a guru, and it is quite reasonable.  To be a guru, you need to sit on the OS not every now and then, but every day.  Experiencing old tender feelings for the Reddish-branch, I stopped at the freshest distro - Linux Fedora Core 8.0. <br><br>  Knowing the main rule of admins: ‚Äúdrink beer, starting any serious business,‚Äù I scored ‚ÄúGolden Pheasant‚Äù and got down to business.  Because  at home there is an Internet through DSL, then I decided to tick off ‚Äúadditional repositories‚Äù and expand the list of available packages during installation.  For good reason I did so !!!  The packages turned out to be a lot of different and tasty.  Sat and licked at everything, trying not to pump too much from an Internet.  When the choice of packages was completed and the installation began, it turned out that the server was loaded and the download speed was slow.  Having extinguished the monitor, I lay down to sleep.  In the morning I saw a freshly installed Fedor in all its glory and a devoured traffic of 500 rubles (mega 300-350).

      I brought the film from work in the evening and decided to look at the newly installed linux.  The absence of MPlayer did not surprise me and I rushed to install it sharply.  In Fedor there were several shells for installing software.  Having finished playing with them, I got a conflict between them and a persistent unwillingness of some to work.  Sam admin, so well understand their laziness.  Having put several packages to satisfy dependencies, I never installed MPlayer.  Reading the manual did nothing, post the problem on the forums.  When I got tired of waiting, I downloaded the raw materials from the official site, then slowly and sadly began to poke buttons that formed into letters: make configure ... In the distro with packages this is not the best way, but in light of the imminent release of the 9th Fedora with KDE 4.1, I decided not to bathe.  In the evening I sat and watched movies. <br><br>  The next task was listening to music, specifically installing XMMS with mp3 support.  That I knew that this support was thrown out of the distribution kit, the format was closed and a penny should be deducted for use.  After reading the manuals, I realized that while I was too lazy to do this (did I say that I was an admin?).  As a temporary measure, I stopped at ‚Äúmplayer -playlist‚Äù, since he also plays music. <br><br>  The next task was to adjust the parameters of the screw to accelerate.  Having typed the coveted command ‚Äúhdparm -t / dev / hda‚Äù, my jaw very quickly fell on the floor: <br><br>  [root @ dark dark] # hdparm -t / dev / hda <br>  / dev / hda: No such file or directory <br><br>  WHAT THE FUCK ???  Where did my / dev / hda go ???  With shaking fingers, I type df -h to view the free space on the screws and at the same time the partitions themselves, after which I roll head over heels from the chair: <br><br>  [root @ dark] # df -h <br>  The file system Size Usp% is mounted on <br>  / dev / sdb3 52G 11G 38G 23% / <br>  tmpfs 125M 0 125M 0% / dev / shm <br>  / dev / sda5 37G 37G 278M 100% / mnt / win / disk40_1 <br>  / dev / sdb2 65G 46G 19G 72% / mnt / win / disk160_1 <br>  / dev / sdb4 9,8G 53M 9,8G 1% / mnt / win / disk160_2 <br><br>  WHAT ARE THE FUCK / dev / sda and / dev / sdb ???  My system does not know what SATA is, I have not seen them in my eyes and in general my mother is old.  Okay, you need to test the speed on the clarified sections, after which it again fell into a solid insoluble precipitate: <br>  # hdparm -t / dev / sda <br>  / dev / sda: Timing buffered disk reads: 26 MB in 3.40 seconds = 7.65 MB / sec <br><br>  I decided to type the coveted hdparm -m3 -c1 -d1 -k1 / dev / sda command to speed up the work.  Her result was very discouraged: <br>  Installing 32-bit screw access does not plow <br><br>  [root @ dark dark] # hdparm -c1 / dev / sda <br>  / dev / sda: <br>  setting 32-bit IO_support flag to 1 <br>  HDIO_SET_32BIT failed: Invalid argument <br>  IO_support = 0 (default 16-bit) <br><br>  The setting of the multicount parameter also failed: <br><br>  [root @ dark dark] # hdparm -m3 / dev / sda <br><br>  / dev / sda: <br>  setting multcount to 3 <br>  HDIO_SET_MULTCOUNT failed: Inappropriate ioctl for device <br>  HDIO_GET_MULTCOUNT failed: Inappropriate ioctl for device <br><br>  [root @ dark dark] # hdparm -m1 / dev / sda <br><br>  / dev / sda: <br>  setting multcount to 1 <br>  HDIO_SET_MULTCOUNT failed: Inappropriate ioctl for device <br>  HDIO_GET_MULTCOUNT failed: Inappropriate ioctl for device <br>  [root @ dark dark] # hdparm -m3 / dev / sda <br><br>  The inclusion of the DMA mode did not bring much joy: <br><br>  [root @ dark dark] # hdparm -d1 / dev / sda <br><br>  / dev / sda: <br>  setting using_dma to 1 (on) <br>  HDIO_SET_DMA failed: Inappropriate ioctl for device <br><br>  This is called a big black Negro ass.  Reading the manuals and chatting on the forums revealed the following: normal IDE screws are called / dev / sda with 2.6.19 kernel (http://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_2_6_19#head-cdcbaa9c1b476decdc064e0a75d23d1328b1ddce), and the library of work of the system of the staff of the group of the staff of the staff of the group of the staff of the staff of the group of the staff of the staff of the group of the staff of the readers of the group of the staff of the readers of the group of the staff of the readers of the group of the staff of the readers for the group of the staff of the dischargers, etc., in the program of the work of the staff of the staff of the discharges, etc., in the system of the work of the discharges, in the work of the discharges, in the discharges, in the discharges, in the discharges, in the discharges of the discharges, in the discharges, in the discharges, in the discharges, in the forums; bit mode of operation (http://linux-ata.org/faq.html#old_ioctls) <br>  In short, I achieved the acceleration of work only by forcing the PIO-4 screws to work in SETUP, and at the output <br><br>  [root @ dark] # hdparm -t / dev / sda <br><br>  / dev / sda: <br>  Timing buffered disk reads: 98 MB in 3.01 seconds = 32.57 MB / sec <br><br>  Okay, you can live. <br><br>  The next task is ICQ.  Kopete seemed to me quite nice.  After setting it up, it turned out that the messages arrive with a hogger.  3 minutes on Yandex suggested that it is solved very simply.  We click on the daisy at the bottom right (in the contact list), select the tab ‚Äúproperties‚Äù - ‚Äúaccount settings‚Äù, there we select ‚Äúencoding for messages by default - win1251‚Äù. <br><br>  Next - mail.  While I have not decided on the mailer, and I need to have access to the mail archive of thebat-vind windows.  When installing Linux I installed wine.  It was lazy to tune in, I tried ‚Äúon a fool‚Äù to type "wine thebat.exe" and O MIRACLE, it all worked!  When I read the forums and docks, I will determine the choice of a mailer into which you can upload the Bat archive.  On Habr√© planted a handful of ideas: <br>  3al: <br>  Export to mbox format, then import in your favorite mailer (Thunderbird (emnip with plugin), Claws mail) <br><br>  alrond: <br>  The claws mail is the bat!  in the linux world <br>  He himself transferred tens of thousands of letters from the baht via mbox. <br>  I lack only the search in all folders / boxes <br><br>  If the topic in the minus is not driven, then later I can continue in the same spirit. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/23313/">https://habr.com/ru/post/23313/</a></p>
