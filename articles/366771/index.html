No matter how well the authors programmed his behavior, when confronted with reality, the robot is still not good enough. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c7e/793/1e1/c7e7931e12144e9a991853def2f6fe7e.gif"><br><br>  I think the answer is obvious - robots have no natural selection.  How well the creators would not have thought them through, they will never compare with reality.  Only natural selection can make engineers jump above their heads.  And robots really evolve.

      And where is natural selection more effective than ever?  In fights without rules.  When two robots enter the arena, and one comes out.  In general, all that is waiting for you on <a href="http://www.bronebot.ru/"><b></b></a><b><a href="http://www.bronebot.ru/">www.bronebot.ru</a></b> on October 31 and November 1.  Here, for example, the famous champion " <a href="http://www.kan-opener.com/"><b>Opener</b></a> " - during the time of participation in the battles, its authors changed seven models, each of which took into account the experience of the previous battles.  As a result, the car was born significantly superior base model. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/337/c9e/1b4/337c9e1b4cac1fd1e0aa81078e871ca3.gif" alt="image">  Ôøº <br><br>  The first problem was the overturning of the robot, brilliantly solved in the second generation - the robot became two-way. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/750/0ec/208/7500ec20811344109e90e58cf8f6f6ee.jpg">  Ôøº <br><br>  The third generation has added new hydraulics, the design of robots turned out to be too strong. <br><br>  Ôøº <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/294/176/d1e/294176d1e4a91bcf138341d64dc39196.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The fourth generation radically strengthened durable case. <br><br>  Ôøº <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bb9/7ff/030/bb97ff0306f5cc796d23db27d86b7956.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Generation E has completely changed the stuffing, now it has become smaller, safer and more invulnerable. <br><br>  Ôøº <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/14d/b9c/2fb/14db9c2fb4a1915339da224fa284b2a6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Generation F - again a completely updated filling, new hydraulics and new battle tactics - now claws can produce two pressure modes - 4.25 tons for durable designs and 2.5 tons for everyday use. <br><br>  Ôøº <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2c1/642/470/2c164247032edf6b9d5e0d1e917754dc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  What distinguishes the first model from the last?  Reasonableness of all nodes.  If in the first robot the design was based only on the theoretical estimates of the authors, then model F is a combat vehicle in which, like a warship, there is nothing superfluous, and each node and element underwent severe practical tests. <br><br>  What made the authors every time so radically improve their robot, each time surpassing themselves?  Enemy.  Which each time was a little better, more experienced and faster.  So the robot had to get better, or disappear.  Only a stronger enemy can make you evolve. <br><br>  If we consider this phenomenon on a larger scale, then the history of the development of helicopters involuntarily suggests itself - the benefit they appeared almost very recently and their evolution proceeded before our eyes.  Beginning in the late 1950s, for the first time in history, the massive use of helicopters in the Vietnam War began.  The inventive opposition of the enemy and the need to quickly make changes to the design led to a very rapid progress of all aviation technology.  The Duma will not be an exaggeration to say that in the ten years of Vietnam helicopters have come a long way more than in all the previous half century. <br><br>  Bell started using light transport helicopters for medical services back in Korea; you can remember these cars on the MASH series. <br><br>  Ôøº <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/831/550/0ce/8315500ce6274ea1a191d7347c5a6703.jpg"><br><br>  Great car, but low-lift and completely defenseless from enemy fire.  Considering the Korean experience, Bell suggested that the army develop something better based on <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_47">Bell 47</a> .  So in 1956, was born <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_UH-1_Iroquois_variants">XH40</a> . <br><br>  Ôøº <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/004/8c8/883/0048c88832ed4a4cbb6f8fc80acae9e6.jpg"><br><br>  As you can see, he is already very similar to the famous Vietnamese " <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_UH-1_Iroquois">Huey</a> ", but he will still have to go through the thorny path of evolution - in the very first battles it turned out that engine power is definitely not enough, the control system is easily damaged by enemy fire, the door is jammed, and the capacity is needed a couple of times more.  Taking into account all these moments, the Bell UH-1 ‚ÄúHuey‚Äù was born - the most successful and recognizable helicopter of the twentieth century. <br><br>  Ôøº <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/70e/c81/6e3/70ec816e36f3446cab11a2a808934732.jpg"><br><br>  At first, everything went well, but then the Vietnamese had <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A8%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0_(%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D1%2585%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2583%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0)">Shilka</a> anti-aircraft guns and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0-2">Strela-2</a> MANPADS.  The helicopters were quickly unable to reach the troops in the action zone until they cleared the landing zone.  Of the 7,000 cars in Vietnam, 3300 were shot down.  Such a low ratio of casualties to the number of combat sorties is unique for aircraft in the context of intensive military operations ‚Äî 1:18 000. However, a significant part of the combat losses fell into the ‚Äúflight incidents‚Äù column.  For example, if a downed helicopter landed on its airfield, where it burned safely, it was not counted as a downed one.  The same happened with the decommissioned machines, which managed to return, but were not subject to recovery.  The command demanded to leave such a survivable helicopter, but to turn the transport "Huey" into a strike force.  Thus, the Bell Model 207 Sioux Scout modification was born, the features of UH-1 are still guessed in it, but a completely different role is already visible. <br><br>  Ôøº <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/819/bd6/48d/819bd648d3b843d19407186835037391.jpg"><br><br>  The very first tests forced the designers to go ahead and screw up all the parameters to the limit.  Reduce the body to 90 (!!!) cm and book it, the car was equipped with the most modern electronics and weapons.  The main attention was paid to protection from enemy fire - the hull was so narrow that it was difficult to even touch the helicopter with small arms.  And from the systems of MANPADS defended exhaust dispersion system through the rotor.  So in 1967 the first in the world attack helicopter <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_AH-1_Cobra">AH Z1 Cobra</a> was born. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a56/f37/1cf/a56f371cfabe49549042e70743ca7b69.jpg">  Ôøº <br><br>  The cobra was so successful that it was able to make a decisive contribution to the break in the war ‚Äî in the final stages, the Americans were able to completely abandon the use of ground forces and only by aviation forces stopped the general offensive of North Vietnam against An Loc in 1972.  Imagine - only 1000 cars could replace more than 300,000 infantrymen!  All this was possible due to the amazing adaptability of the machine - in the jungles of Vietnam she felt like sowing at home - the narrow profile did not allow to defeat, the duplicated control system did not allow to lose control even when hit, and the guidance systems destroyed the anti-aircraft gunners before they started.  Of the 1,100 cars in Vietnam, 300 were shot down. <br><br>  Ôøº <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/379/c41/301/379c413013a046de90087e52c2276059.jpg"><br><br>  This example clearly shows how rapid and radical progress can be if you give it the right motivation.  In just 10 years, the Americans have traveled from a low-speed, easily-transported helicopter to an invulnerable hunter.  And a simple Viet Cong member helped them with Soviet MANPADS in their hands.  Without the Strela-2 system in Vietnam, the AH-1 Cobra would not have come into being ‚Äî the only machines capable of surviving a direct hit by an anti-aircraft missile. <br><br>  Ôøº <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7f3/b4a/1c5/7f3b4a1c543744a7be7c4af3c82097a5.jpg"><br><br>  Now let's see if we can also speed up the evolution of Russian robots.  In the next post we will tell about them in more detail, but for now we bring to your attention a list of English-robot champions who will come to help our teams evolve in the ring: <br><br>  Ôøº <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/89e/04e/ea1/89e04eea132a48d6ae4b9a2e766a0f06.jpg"><br><br>  RIPPER (JOHN &amp; DAVID FINDLAY) <br>  This is the sixth incarnation of the robot Ripper, one of the most <br>  successful heavyweight robots.

After that, he often took second place in local competitions until he gained the upper hand in 2005.  He was altered so many times, but he invariably carries his flipper, which has already shown its superiority many times, throwing opponents out of the Arena. <br><br>  Ôøº <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/24c/883/935/24c8839355614c0987ae25ce3e791498.jpg"><br><br>  STINGER (KEVIN SCOTT, JOHN &amp; DAVID FINDLAY) <br>  Stinger is known for its uncontrollability.  However, this is not only the headache of his pilots, but also the horror of his opponents.  You never know what to expect from him.  He then accelerates, forcing his heavy ax with a roar and sparks to descend again and again on the body of the enemy, then begins to frantically revolve around its axis, inflicting heavy wounds on the blades to everyone who dares to approach. <br>  ‚Ä¢ 3rd place in the British competition, 2000 <br>  ‚Ä¢ Winning the ‚ÄúRobot Live‚Äù team tournament with the Tilly All-Stars team, 2010 <br>  Year of creation: 1999 <br>  Weight: 95 kg <br>  Speed: 16 km / h <br>  Armor: steel shell <br>  Power: two 750 Watt electric motors <br>  Weapons: Shock ax + spikes with blades <br>  Strengths: Truly heavy weapons, the robot is a rather ‚Äúslippery type‚Äù for its opponents <br>  Weaknesses: hard to manage <br>  Team: Kevin Scott, John Findlay and David Findlay <br><br>  Description: Stinger is a heavyweight veteran who has been involved in fights for 16 years.
