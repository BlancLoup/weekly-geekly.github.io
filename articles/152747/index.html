      Once I noticed that if you drag and drop any folder into Start =&gt; All Programs, then it‚Äôs not a shortcut that is created, but a folder. <br>  You can drag it to your desktop and it will look like a folder, but behave like a shortcut. <br>  It puzzled me, and I began to dig deeper. <br>  Found that these folders are created in the "Network Neighborhood" and behave the same way. <br><br>  I understood that it is impossible to see the "real" insides of a folder using the explorer. <br>  By running the console, I was able to get to the files inside. <br><br>  There were two files: desktop.ini and target.lnk <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5fc/a07/f41/5fca07f419ec5a9e6392637a19a6d419.jpg"><br>  If you rename or delete one of the files, Explorer will show the real insides. <br><br>  In the desktop.ini file I found the following text: <br><pre><code class="cpp hljs">[.ShellClassInfo] CLSID2={<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0</span></span>AFACED1-E828<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">-11</span></span>D1<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">-9187</span></span>-B532F1E9575D} Flags=<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">2</span></span></code> </pre> <br>  A label referred to the folder that I created at the beginning. <br><br>  I was interested in it, because I realized that there could be more files inside such a folder, and no one would see them. <br>  At the university, all computers were with limited access, and any student could delete my personal files folder, and I did not have a computer at that time. <br>  And then there was no flash drive.  Floppy disks are not reliable, so it was not safe to store your files on university computers. <br><br>  And I realized that no one would see my files in such a folder, and I can get access to my folder at the direct address inside the shortcut folder. <br>  But this did not give protection to personal files: the folder could still be deleted along with my data. <br><br>  I fumbled further with an interesting folder, tried to replace the target.lnk file with my own, and watch what happens. <br>  You can change the shortcut icon, and the folder icon in this case also changes. <br><br>  And then I created a shortcut to the same desktop.ini file, renamed it to target.lnk <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a9a/3f4/136/a9a3f41368054fb48a763e24dfca82b8.jpg"><br>  I didn‚Äôt immediately believe this effect and didn‚Äôt understand what was happening: after renaming, the explorer immediately gave an error and restarted. <br>  I climbed back into the created folder, and as soon as I saw it, the explorer departed again. <br><br>  I began to explore the strange effect and realized that the explorer was trying to get the properties of the folder-shortcut, and they were redirected to the folder itself again.  The result is looping. <br>  I tried to enter the folder with different programs: even Total Commander took off when trying to enter it, even if it was delayed.  It was possible to enter it only with the help of the console. <br><br>  And I realized that this folder will store my data well, and none of the students can even click on it to delete it. <br><br><h4>  Sequencing </h4><br>  Then I will tell you how to make such a folder, unbind the binding to the path, and how to create such a ‚Äúprotected‚Äù folder on a flash drive that would ‚Äúwork‚Äù, as expected, on all computers. <br><br><h5>  In order for a label <s>killer</s> folder to work as expected, there must be the following: </h5><br><ul><li>  folder must have System attribute </li><li>  The folder must have a desktop.ini file with the correct content. </li><li>  the folder must have a target.lnk shortcut that refers to the desktop.ini file in the same folder </li></ul><br><h5>  When creating such a folder using the explorer, there are pitfalls </h5><br><ul><li>  the System attribute for the folder must be set before creating internal files </li><li>  you must first write the data to desktop.ini and only after that put it in the folder </li><li>  before you put the shortcut target.lnk in the folder, you need to restart into it </li></ul><br><h5>  Create a "protected" folder that works on all Windows file systems. </h5><br><ol><li>  create an empty folder, preferably not on the desktop </li><li>  create a subfolder, put your data there and remember the path </li><li>  set the original folder attribute System </li><li>  create a text file desktop.txt and write data into it as written above </li><li>  rename desktop.txt to desktop.ini </li><li>  create a shortcut on desktop.ini called target.lnk and the explorer will restart </li></ol><br>  Now you need to go to your subfolder only at the address and, preferably, not in the conductor (due to saving the previous paths). <br>  For example, in the console, write explorer.exe &lt;folder address&gt;, and the history will not be saved so that no one can figure out the path. <br><br>  To automate the creation of such a folder, I wrote a script: <br><pre> <code class="vbscript hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">Dim</span></span> arg, WSHShell, fsobj, file, link <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">Set</span></span> arg = WScript.Arguments <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">Set</span></span> WSHShell = WScript.<span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">CreateObject</span></span>(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"WScript.Shell"</span></span>) <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">Set</span></span> fsobj = WScript.<span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">CreateObject</span></span>(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"Scripting.FileSystemObject"</span></span>) <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">If</span></span> arg.Length = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">Then</span></span> WSHShell.Popup <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"    "</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">End</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">If</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">If</span></span> arg.Length &gt; <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">Then</span></span> <span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">'    fsobj.GetFolder(arg(0)).Attributes = 1 '  desktop.ini Set file = fsobj.OpenTextFile(arg(0) + "\desktop.ini", 2, True) file.Write "[.ShellClassInfo]" + vbCrLf file.Write "CLSID2={0AFACED1-E828-11D1-9187-B532F1E9575D}" + vbCrLf file.Write "Flags=2" + vbCrLf file.Close '  target.lnk    desktop.ini Set link = WSHShell.CreateShortcut(arg(0) + "\target.lnk") link.TargetPath = arg(0) + "\desktop.ini" link.Save WSHShell.Popup "- " End If</span></span></code> </pre><br>  It must be saved to a file called mkFolderKiller.vbs, and drag the folder onto it. <br><br><h5>  Binding the path to a protected folder </h5><br>  The created folder will strictly depend on its original address. <br>  If you rename it, then it will be possible to enter it. <br>  And I found a solution, although not ideal, but which allows you to change the address of the folder. <br><br>  We need to create an empty folder in a place where the user cannot climb. <br>  For example, deep in the system files (if available). <br>  We assign the System attribute to it, and write the desktop.ini file there, but we do not rush to make a shortcut. <br><br>  Now, on another disk, where there should be a folder with data, do the same, for example, on D: \. <br>  We take the shortcut of the desktop.ini file from the C: \ drive and put it in a folder that is on the D: \ drive.  Only then do we make a shortcut in the C: \ drive folder. <br><br>  As a result, the folder on the D: \ drive will perform its ‚Äúfunction‚Äù that we need, even if its address is changed. <br><br><h5>  Protecting folders on a flash drive </h5><br>  There is nothing special to say. <br>  I think many have guessed that you can create a folder in which there will be ‚Äúprotected‚Äù folders for all the letters of the alphabet. <br>  And only you can get access to your protected folder, knowing the full address. <br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br>  Everyone can create this folder for themselves, for fun, for tests or for the sake of primitive protection. <br><br><h5>  Is this a reliable protection? </h5><br>  Of course not.  There are many other ways more reliable than this. <br>  For an experienced user, it will not be difficult to figure out and get into such a ‚Äúprotected‚Äù folder. <br>  But it will puzzle for a while.  And ordinary users will not be able to get there at all. <br><br><h5>  On which versions of Windows will this folder ‚Äúwork‚Äù? </h5><br>  Personally, I conducted all the experiments at the university, on Windows XP and 2000. <br>  And, over time, on Windows Vista, 7 and Windows 8. <br>  Regardless of the capacity of the system, it works on all versions. <br><br><h5>  Does this folder harm the computer? </h5><br>  Of course not.  All she does is looping the process that wants to access her, and this causes it to restart. <br><br><h5>  How to delete such a killer folder? </h5><br>  You can go to the folder using the console and rename one of the two files or remove the System flag from the folder. <br>  Or rename the root folder to neutralize the loop. <br><br><h5>  If you can not wait to try </h5><br>  You can download the file by link <a href="">ShortcutKiller.rar</a> , <br>  unpack it into the folder C: \ TEMP \ 1234, and restart into it. <br>  The archive has a folder 1 with two files desktop.ini and target.lnk, tied only to this path. <br><br>  I hope the article was interesting to you, and that I was able to explain everything well. <br>  I found many more different glitches about which it is not written anywhere, maybe I will tell you another time :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/152747/">https://habr.com/ru/post/152747/</a></p>
