  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Was the accounting?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Do you believe that accountants existed?  Until recently, I not only did not believe, but I had no idea about accountants.  I believed when I came across the old phrase, semi-digitized from time, in a pip iskovik: "The accountant is obliged to submit an annual report before April 1." <br><br>  Everything in this quotation breathed the secret of the ages: what is an accountant really?  and what is the annual report meaningless even by name?  and where this incomprehensible subject is supposed to take?  Only a hint of April 1 was transparent.  In some places in the open spaces of the Planetary Brotherhood, there is still an ancient custom to joke on friends and neighbors that day: pour water from a kettle or put a sequential instrument in the posterior cerebral connector.  Therefore, I decided that the phrase ‚ÄúThe accountant is obliged to submit the annual report before April 1‚Äù is nothing more than a witty joke, or at least an untranslatable play on words. <br><br>  What was my surprise when further research showed: not a joke and not a pun.  Accountants existed in the pre-quantum era, when, due to strife and lack of organization, humankind led a semi-wild existence. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This is hard to believe, but these are historical facts.  It is even more difficult to understand what kind of useful functions the accountants performed: I can only say that they were related to ... hmm-hmm-hmm ... accounting services for vital activity.

      I apologize for repeating the elementary truths, but without them understanding of the topic is impossible. <br><br>  How is livelihoods ensured in our enlightened age?  At first, we take from us public life tools and high-calorie organic matter, then sensors automatically - and how else, if not automatically?  - register consumption, after which the registration data is entered into the Accounting universe.  The same happens in manufacturing, where sensors register the participation of each of us in the production process.  As a result, it becomes possible to calculate the balance of labor costs - a lifeline, proving the right of every biological individual to exist.  Individuals with a positive balance have a supply of vital energy, and individuals with a negative balance are at risk of being excluded from buyers because they rarely visit manufacturers.  This is cruel, but fair, because purchasing and manufacturing are two sides of a single process of life activity.  This order of management is so familiar that few people think about it. <br><br>  But it was not always so.  In the brief historical epoch between the invention of the wheel and the abolition of statehood, other accounting principles were practiced, and accountants were their guides.  It is difficult to believe in this, but the initial data were entered into computer systems ‚Äî primitive still laptops and smart loops ‚Äî manually, and the reporting data was manually generated!  The people sentenced to this martyrdom were called accountants. <br><br>  At first I decided that this was due to the lack of sensors in the pit and fabricators, but upon reflection, I had to abandon this idea.  Humanity was not so underdeveloped not to use sensors.  Could not the thinking beings think of the simple idea that, if there are computer gadgets, the registration of any object should be carried out automatically?  Why, in this case, humanity did not take advantage of automatic registration, but preferred to pull millions of innocent individuals, accountants, out of the production process, so that they manually enter the original data into computer systems?  Such a decision is unpairable, to say the least. <br><br>  Even more strange is the compilation practiced in ancient times ... I ask you to maintain control over the bladder and vestibular apparatus! .. compilation of reports of a given, rather than an arbitrary, form.  Today, a rational procedure for obtaining a report is obvious to every browser: you are applying to the Accounting Creation and get an answer.  The training course in bebigadens is the art of asking adequate questions in order to get reasonable answers to them.  And in the dark pre-quantum times in question, the individual was not free in curiosity: he was given the only answer to all questions about production, for some masochistic irony called public (sic!) Reporting.  Although what does the public have to do with it, how can a heterogeneous public ask the same question in order to receive the only answer to it? <br><br>  By the way, the reports were not generated for any required date, but only for past periods.  I say this because the end of the mysterious phrase ‚ÄúThe accountant must submit an annual report before April 1‚Äù indicates the day of the current reporting ... for the last year.  Exactly so, dear soplanetniki, over the past year!  Although why today may need data for the last year, why not for the past century?  And it was strictly forbidden to request production data for the current year, especially for future moments, it was also forbidden to request data for a period not coinciding with the calendar year. <br><br>  And the existence of so-called auditors, who were engaged in manually re-checking the accounting reports and manually certifying their authenticity, seems completely altruistic.  Reliability is not software algorithms, as you probably thought, but the reports themselves!  If accountants were grouped around made - probably due to some sacred economic rite that had died off over time, then the auditors would unite with each other outside of any production, forming bizarre biological colonies functioning according to their laws.  Once a calendar year, auditors made raids on the manufacturer with the already announced goal of ‚Äúchecking‚Äù the accounting report and ‚Äúvising‚Äù it with a manual signature.  Why they did it is unknown.  From the height of today's experience, it is obvious that, despite the cooperation of many co-planners in order to achieve a common goal, the source of consumption is the labor of the individual.  Consequently, individual and not total social labor is subject to registration and accounting: calculations must be made separately for each individual, and not at all for manufacturing.  But our ancestors had a vague idea about the economy, unfortunately. <br><br>  These are the results of the research - in my opinion, sensational.  I admit that I could not find them an acceptable explanation.  Whether our ancestors were clinical idiots or just blind, remains a mystery: the presence of gadgets indicates the birth of intelligence, but the categorical inability to use information technology proves the opposite.  I will make a reservation that the ancient accountants had nothing to do with nanomakers, quantomas and fagots, whose existence in the transition period to the Planetary Brotherhood can be considered a necessary measure.  No, accountants are fundamentally different, inexplicable, frightening by the lack of rationality and not falling within the framework of mathematical logic. <br><br>  Who the accountants were in reality and how gloomy the role was played in the development of the Planetary Brotherhood, scientists still have to figure out. <br><br>  *** <br>  Before publishing the article, I rechecked artifacts three times and found no significant contradictions in them.  In proof of the fact that this is not a rally, I‚Äôm ready to send the pentographic neurogram of my brain and spinal cord to anyone who doubts, at his first request. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/172539/">https://habr.com/ru/post/172539/</a></p>
