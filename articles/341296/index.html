However, even if you are not from Moscow, you probably heard about him.  After all, this is the flagship park of national scale and the real attraction of modern Moscow.  Here, 16th century heritage sites coexist with innovative architecture and high-tech media complexes.  We will tell about them today.  After all, we all know firsthand - they themselves supplied the equipment and set it up. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/333/ecc/bea/333eccbea97e07a103118407d31bc308.jpg"><br>  <i>Perhaps the best construction site in Russia - with views of the Kremlin and St. Basil's Cathedral.</i>  <i>Eye-catching!</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  If suddenly someone did not hear </h2><br>  Construction of the park "Zaryadie" began in 2015.  In Moscow, this is the first large-scale project in more than 50 years to create a unique space near the Kremlin walls at the junction of a diverse natural landscape, high technology and architecture.  Zaryadie, the first park built within the boundaries of the Boulevard Ring, has already become the center of attraction for residents and guests of the capital. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">History of Charges</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The name of the park comes from the name of one of the oldest districts of Moscow, Zaryadya, whose history goes back over 8 centuries.

      In the twentieth century it was supposed to place here one of Moscow's skyscrapers, but the project was not completed.  In 1967, the Hotel Russia was built on the foundation laid, at that time the largest in the world. <br><br>  At the beginning of the XXI century, the Moscow government decided to dismantle a huge, heavily dilapidated and obsolete building.  In 2006 the hotel was closed and dismantled.  In its place it was planned to build a new hotel and office complex with parking.  But in early 2012, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that a modern park would be set up in the historic Zaryadye district. <br><br>  In the first stage of the international competition for the creation of a landscape-architectural concept of the park, applications from 27 countries, from 420 companies united in 90 consortia, were considered.  The competition jury included leading specialists in architecture and urban planning, among them Saskia Sassen, a professor at Columbia University, Anthony Vives-i-Thomas, vice-mayor of Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãand Marta Thorn, executive director of the Pritzker Prize.  The victory was won by an international consortium, which included architects from the Diller Scofidio + Renfro bureau (New York), landscape workshop specialists from Hargreaves Associates (New York), and urbanists from Citymakers (Moscow). <br>  Construction of the park "Zaryadie" began in 2015.  In 2017, the construction of the park was completed. <br><br>  Read more about the history of Zaryadya <a href="http://www.zaryadyepark.ru/history/">here</a> . <br></div></div><br>  But Zaryadie is not only a <a href="http://www.zaryadyepark.ru/landscapes/">landscape</a> , it is also a very complex engineering and IT infrastructure, which helps to organize modern educational programs and interactive recreation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3b8/24a/968/3b824a968356605b91a1a5e5036181c0.jpg"><br>  <i>Basically, we don‚Äôt immediately show the finished version - go and see for yourself.</i>  <i>Only techno hardcore!</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/eb5/2f3/f3d/eb52f3f3da6833c8167d7ccf4f6b12c9.jpg"><br>  <i>This is how the best viewing platform of Moscow is created - the floating bridge of the Zaryadye Park: a V-shaped console located at a height of 13 m above the river.</i>  <i>It offers panoramic views of the Kremlin, the embankment and the park itself.</i> <br><br><h2>  Make it suddenly </h2><br>  If you have ever worked with Russian projects, and even of such importance, then you probably know what deadlines are and how they are related to them.  A five-year plan in three years is resting compared to how much we have done our part of the Zaryadya automation.  So, for example, the entire project took two years from launching it to launch, two and a half of them were working directly in the fields.  We, the specialists of <a href="http://itlanit.ru/">LANIT-Integration</a> , collected and launched the ‚ÄúPolet‚Äù media complex in 9 months, while in international practice such works take 2 years or more. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bf5/3fe/650/bf53fe65000cda1c47a50587d1c2d382.jpg"><br>  <i>Installation of equipment for the ‚ÄúTime Machine‚Äù media complex.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d46/a94/a84/d46a94a848db62d61ced8191ff009ace.jpg"><br>  <i>Soon there will be people instead of forests.</i>  <i>The real ones.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ed7/e80/2ce/ed7e802cebfdf72332d4c514d328cfbe.jpg"><br>  <i>And only the species continued to delight us.</i> <br><br><h2>  "Flight" in a dream and in reality </h2><br>  The media complex is a cinema with an acoustically transparent projection screen in the form of a sphere 11 meters high and a specialized platform with auditorium seats that have 6 degrees of freedom (you can sit down as comfortable). <br><br>  The highlight of the attraction is that before the start of the show program, the platform is in a horizontal position and the audience simply enters the room and sits in places.  When the show begins, the platform rises and turns 90 degrees.  After that, everyone finds themselves alone with stunning views of Moscow, and the multi-channel sound system and special effects, which work synchronously with the video sequence and the turns of the platform, give a real sense of flight. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1cb/976/933/1cb976933b1433af89d325041895b018.jpg"></div>  <i>This is how the media complex looked like before our team took on the installation.</i> <br><br>  Going to the ‚ÄúFlight‚Äù, you can rush through the fountains of VDNH, smell the fresh air filled with water splashes over the Kremlin and Kuskovo estate, stay in the epicenter of fireworks, watch the festival of balloons from a bird's eye view and much more.  For the technical side there are 3 projectors with 4K resolution - each, 4 specialized video servers, more than 80 tons of mechanics and hydraulics.  And over 16 kW of sound to help. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e6b/dd4/eab/e6bdd4eab9dd0d9f278a83d5aa4f084d.jpg"><br>  <i>We were helped by Spider-Man, without it the wires would obviously have to be tight.</i> <br><br>  Does such a system seem fragile to you?  Nothing like this!  Security has become a top priority.  All rides in Russia are subject to mandatory certification, receive the relevant documents, coupons, etc.  "Flight" was tested on the upper bar.  After the installation and adjustment were completed, they flew first over the virtual Moscow on the seats ... sandbags.  Moreover, these are standard bags weighing 80 kg - as a dense person, but we decided that the load should be above the norm and put on 136 kg - the maximum bar. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6a8/895/55c/6a889555c69473a2ba1b54989cb14d0e.jpg"><br>  <i>Here are our first testers - sandbags</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1c4/878/4ff/1c48784ffe4ececfb7f75cadefccdff5.jpg"><br>  <i>Altitude fitters send you greetings from a height!</i>  <i>Pay attention to our not boring forests.</i> <br><br>  And after the sandbags, we flew ourselves, the leadership of LANIT, and even some of the leaders of Moscow.  What can I say - full of delight.  By the way, at first we were still present at the site and saw how groups of visitors were leaving - absolutely everyone applaud after the ‚Äúhire‚Äù. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8c1/a95/12c/8c1a9512c62b510c138089bcfc65de1a.jpg"></div><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fb9/801/c03/fb9801c03853d26a784b0f6bc15602e6.jpg"><br>  <i>Stronger than durable</i> <br><br>  Delight is caused by special special effects: spray, wind, smells.  In fact, everything is quite trivially sprayed.  But the video was made amazingly - the full sensation of flight (the video is the work of the Red Square company, for which many thanks to them).  If you have a fear of heights, then think twice before flying over Moscow in the media complex - everything is very realistic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/339/5a3/08a/3395a308a45acaa6e43678b75e686258.jpg"><br>  <i>Post-industrial portrait in interiors.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a9f/e70/789/a9fe70789bb8a366b19aa66087105a22.jpg"><br>  <i>And this is the platform with the help of which we will ‚Äúfly‚Äù over Moscow.</i>  <i>Well, ready?</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b7e/f8d/bbc/b7ef8dbbc85cae626a64d538c7358e08.jpg"><br>  <i>Is everyone wearing a seat belt?</i>  <i>And even a good mood stocked?</i>  <i>Then let's go!</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/35b/5d0/c36/35b5d0c36fb938d757c1e1a11f4502a3.jpg"><br><br><h2>  "Time Machine": we walked into such steps ... </h2><br>  The second media complex, the installation of which we were engaged in - "Time Machine".  This cool multi-functional presentation pavilion is located in the building of the Zaryadyya media center adjacent to the ‚ÄúFlight‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d84/679/2b6/d846792b619680103f832d37877a3b18.jpg"><br>  <i>The same media center is a view from the inside: on the left side of the reception and ticket sales center is located the center of ‚Äúflights‚Äù above the capital, on the right side - time travel.</i> <br><br>  Getting into the "Time Machine", you find yourself in the very center of the history of the formation and development of our country.  The feeling of complete immersion arises due to the fact that the image is displayed on the floor surface and a cylindrical screen with a diameter of 16.5 and a height of 5 meters.  Multichannel sound amplification system, generators of special effects (smoke, smell, wind) and the possibility of interactive interaction with the video series create the necessary atmosphere.  In the future, the media complex can be used for various events, for example, for educational programs, exhibitions and presentations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/981/376/037/98137603799e6221c08c2c12ed5514f0.jpg"><br>  <i>Bags and here are useful.</i> <br><br>  The projection system is used as the display system of the media complex, and with the help of specialized media servers and show program management software, the projection systems are stitched, the multichannel sound reinforcement system is controlled, the interactive interaction and the special effects work.  The Time Machine is equipped with a specialized system for hearing impaired people. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/53f/1c7/13c/53f1c713c4a6bc478fcc7a07eb0cfbe1.jpg"><br>  <i>This is not smoke on the site, but those very special effects.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aab/1b4/b7e/aab1b4b7ee6b13fea8f3a36a2a435b21.jpg"><br>  <i>The nervous system of the media complex - a view from the inside.</i> <br><br>  33 projectors, 10 specialized media servers, 26 specialized tracking video cameras and more than 20 kW of sound are responsible for all this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/028/0c3/9d8/0280c39d88ded101bec8ac79143dad60.jpg"><br>  <i>While we were having lunch in Ancient Russia, our people assembled and checked the equipment.</i> <br><br>  This is not just a media complex, but a story about great multimedia capabilities, a unique platform for the realization of the most daring ideas of television. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/88c/9c2/102/88c9c2102c914c4f1a2eecdf3e99ff10.jpg"><br>  <i>Anyone who wants to go on a trip on the ‚ÄúTime Machine‚Äù cannot do without a ‚Äúbriefing‚Äù: before visiting, be sure to watch a video about how the video was created.</i>  <i>The film about the history of Moscow shot the First Channel.</i>  <i>Already watched?</i>  <i>Then - go!</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7d3/cf0/f8e/7d3cf0f8ef0e3679e3773d79d15070e7.jpg"><br>  <i>Moving to the "Time Machine", you can not only look at the capital from space ...</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/56c/146/c1e/56c146c1ecc30e93c647003bc2ca77bf.jpg"><br>  <i>But also walk along Abrikosova Street, turn onto Grape ... and find yourself in the very heart of XIX century Moscow.</i> <br><br><h2>  By the way, about learning </h2><br>  Park "Zaryadie" initially did not think solely as a relaxation.  First of all, this is a place to enlighten, develop and satisfy the curiosity of people of all ages.  Our company has acted as a contractor for the equipment of numerous laboratories, video walls, interactive kiosks throughout the park. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dae/0ba/9ce/dae0ba9ce68e8ca448c9fb9bf8a90a31.jpg"><br>  <i>The entire territory of the park is represented on the video card: all that remains is to choose places to visit, relax before a walk and go.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8e6/a95/31a/8e6a9531a46afd9060295433602d96e9.jpg"><br>  <i>You can buy tickets to media complexes or educational programs at an interactive kiosk.</i> <br><br>  The ‚Äúsmart‚Äù part of the project was implemented, for example, in the ‚ÄúReserved Embassy‚Äù pavilion, where in the florarium zone you can enjoy views of remote corners of Russia through a special viewing window.  The LED screen with a pixel pitch of 1.2 mm, dimensions of 5.5x3.1 meters, with a specialized optical coating and sound amplification system really gives the same ‚Äúwindow‚Äù effect to other parts of Russia. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f49/f75/02b/f49f7502b9f6b96a957358e6e6cd85db.jpg"><br>  <i>And from our "window" the Russian steppe is visible.</i>  <i>Even to go anywhere is not necessary.</i> <br><br>  In addition to this effect, screens can be used during seminars and conferences: it is enough to connect a source of media content (for example, a laptop) to the appropriate architectural interface. <br><br>  In the ‚ÄúReserve Embassy‚Äù there are 4 classrooms, a real, powerfully equipped biological laboratory and a conference room, in which training sessions are regularly held.  The premises are equipped with everything necessary for the demonstration of educational materials, including specialized equipment in the biological laboratory, projection systems, interactive whiteboards, video conferencing systems and wireless content broadcast. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ddc/b12/436/ddcb12436dfc03ff64b9bcd4c7ea5cd1.jpg"><br>  <i>Learning or listening to speakers at conferences is a pleasure ...</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c34/409/b57/c34409b57c3c4cf3be0c279b1603e142.jpg"><br>  <i>And to provide simultaneous translation is another.</i> <br><br>  In all the pavilions, the Digital Signage system operates, providing information and navigation support to visitors, while being also part of the design of these pavilions.  Technical details: more than 50 information screens, including interactive kiosks and video walls, more than 60 acoustic systems. <br><br>  By the way, about curiosity - surely you have any questions about the famous "Glass Bark" over the Great Amphitheater of the park.  We have no relation to it, but as engineers, we could not help but find out what kind of mysterious roof of a small world.  This is a metal frame made of glass triangles, under which there is a part of the seats for the spectators of the Large Amphitheater and an observation deck.  Wonderful roof will provide a temperature a few degrees higher than outside.  For the winter - the most it is, and so that in the summer it is not hot, a ventilation system is provided. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d53/422/8ed/d534228edcd8278050b00f85618ee8e2.jpg"><br>  <i>This is how the ‚ÄúGlass Bark‚Äù was created.</i> <br><br><h2>  It was hot </h2><br>  Needless to say, the project was very difficult for us.  Judge for yourself. <br><br><ol><li>  Zaryadia Media Center unites two media complexes described by us and the entire IT infrastructure of the park. <br></li><li>  The ‚ÄúPolet‚Äù mediacomplex, weighing over 80 tons, is located above the underground parking and has no external walls.  The project for its installation was unique. <br></li><li>  The total number of media content pixels for Time Machine is 62,681,104. <br></li><li>  Over 360,000,000 - the total number of pixels of all unique video surfaces. <br></li><li>  More than 55 kW - the total power of acoustic systems in the media center, the ‚ÄúIce Cave‚Äù labyrinth installation and the ‚ÄúReserved Embassy‚Äù scientific and educational center. <br></li><li>  More than 18,000 people per hour - labor costs for the development of project documentation. <br></li></ol><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sf/x2/cq/sfx2cqgup1vpmqs4z01nzd8ofi0.jpeg"></div>  <i>The picture very accurately conveys our state when we learned about the timing</i> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Want to know what we did back in Zaryadye?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  A complete list of all that was attached to the hands and heads, or rather, the staff <a href="http://itlanit.ru/">of LANIT-Integration</a> equipped the equipment: <br><ul><li>  The media center of the park; <br></li><li>  Media complex "Flight" and pre-show; <br></li><li>  media complex "Time Machine" and pre-show; <br></li><li>  Digital Signage in the Media Center, Ice Cave and Conservation Embassy; <br></li><li>  Entrance zone "Moscow now"; <br></li><li>  Media Studio ‚ÄúGlavkino.

For example, we were accused of taking "testers" for pull.  Since equipping media complexes is a serious matter related to the health and safety of people, we carried out not only technical briefing, but also trained park personnel to work with emergency situations: how to seat spectators, how to help them get out of the room, how to control - all these processes do not allow liberties on the part of the park workers and the visitors themselves.  So, someone decided that for training we take ours and ours.  Actually, we invited volunteers in exchange for a session in each media complex. <br><br>  For two years we worked around the clock and seven days a week, not really even noticing the change of seasons.  And the park "Zaryadie" taught us the main lesson: to believe in yourself and not be afraid of either deadlines or disruptions from suppliers.  Now we know that we can do such projects with honor. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">For those who want to become part of our team, there are several vacancies in Lanit Integration.</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  <a href="https://job.lanit.ru/vacancy/Pages/MM-68.aspx%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost-31-10%26utm_campaign%3Dhabr">Design Engineer for audio-visual complexes and video conferencing</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://job.lanit.ru/vacancy/Pages/MM-40.aspx%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost-31-10%26utm_campaign%3Dhabr">System architect</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://job.lanit.ru/vacancy/Pages/MM-34.aspx%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost-31-10%26utm_campaign%3Dhabr">Project manager</a> </li></ul><br></div></div><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/68d/7b4/480/68d7b44804d99a40aa4368acb2c014ac.jpg"><br>  <i>After such techno-colors any salute fades.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5e9/3dc/f81/5e93dcf817c5666df11a980dd5cb8510.jpg"><br><br>  Have you been to Zaryadye Park? <br><br>  <i>‚úé Text co-author <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/i_dot_i/" class="user_link">I_DOT_I</a></i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/341296/">https://habr.com/ru/post/341296/</a></p>
