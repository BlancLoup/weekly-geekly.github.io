  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Dell will sell PCs preinstalled with Linux</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We already <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/blog/linux/5355.html">wrote</a> about <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/company/dell/">Dell</a> ‚Äôs initiative to start working more closely with manufacturers of popular Linux distributions in order to satisfy numerous <a href="http://www.dellideastorm.com/">requests from users</a> who want to see computers with a pre-installed free OS in the product line of this brand.  But until now, it was not known about any specific deadlines, nor about the degree of seriousness of the intentions of companies, nor about any other details. <br><br>  But this week in the <a href="http://direct2dell.com/">Direct 2</a> blog <a href="http://direct2dell.com/">of Dell</a> , which serves as one of Dell‚Äôs tools for working with the public, the first post appeared that a rapprochement with Linux is in full swing and the company has developed an optimal, in its view, strategy with which wants to introduce customers. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In particular, Dell made a <a href="http://direct2dell.com/one2one/archive/2007/03/28/9655.aspx">decision</a> on the main problem that has always been between PC and Linux manufacturers - the compatibility issue between hardware and OS.  Those lines of computers that are supposed to be equipped with Linux will be assembled so that the drivers for as much of their components as possible are already contained in the kernel itself.

      For other devices, such as printers and wireless network adapters, the most stable open source drivers supported by the user community will be selected.  But for much more critical from the point of view of stability of parts of the system, for example for video cards, the user can also choose closed drivers from the manufacturer.  Thus, Dell in most cases actually transfers the functions of technical support for future PC buyers with installed Linux to specialized forums and communities, including those that exist around certain OS distributions, depending on the user's choice. <br><br>  The important question that arises from this is: how is Dell going (if at all) to influence hardware manufacturers so that they can open their drivers and, accordingly, specifications for their products?  After all, it will raise the work with the same graphics accelerators to a new level, giving the community the opportunity to squeeze everything out of them. <br><br>  In response, one of the employees of the Linux-team of the company reasonably noted that those who ask such questions should soften their radical position and listen to the arguments of the hardware manufacturers.  With such strong competition, which is between ATI and nVidia, it is difficult to imagine that they will suddenly reveal to the world all their secrets.  It is enough to recall the common practice of software shutdown of some functions of the video chip, which are included only in its more expensive modifications, from which no one will refuse either today or tomorrow. <br><br>  Discussion of only the first post on the topic of Dell-Linux has stretched almost 200 comments.  From his reading it seems that both sides sincerely seek to smooth out all possible angles on the way to a common goal.  And if the same working atmosphere in communication between Open Source activists and the company continues even further, the success of the whole enterprise seems quite achievable. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/6058/">https://habr.com/ru/post/6058/</a></p>
