  <section class="page js-page"><h1>CUSTIS Open Seminars: Graduation Season</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  With the onset of autumn, life, warmed up by the previous season, as if slows down its pace, diminishes the brightness and contrast and freezes in anticipation of heat.  So, at least, the official press thinks: autumn spleen, checkered rugs and notes on how to keep warm and cozy when the rains and the cold wind are raging are in fashion again.  It‚Äôs hard to argue with that, but everyone‚Äôs own idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcomfort.  Our team is confident that it is cozy where you understand, among like-minded professionals, with whom you can spend an evening for interesting discussions about what really interests you. <br><br>  Therefore, we are happy and undisguised pride announce the start of the eighth cycle of open seminars for students and young professionals in the field of IT.  Following a good tradition, we began to prepare in the summer, and now we are ready to offer our students informative and professional-oriented meetings ‚Äî four seminars on the most important IT topics, with our leading experts in the role of lecturers.  This cycle will be the final one in this format, so we tried to make a really ‚Äústrong‚Äù and bright season, so that we don‚Äôt want to think about autumn fall at all. <br><br>  We invite everyone who likes to learn and discover new horizons for us in our cozy office, where for four weeks our experts will share experience, secrets of skill and valuable advice on a variety of professional topics: how to deal with routine in developing Enterprise- applications before the evolution of ideas about modern system administrators and their specialization. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Farewell to the "iron" century: modern approaches to the management of IT-infrastructure </h3><br>  <b>October 8, 18: 30‚Äì20: 30</b>

We will understand what ITIL and ITSM are, what SLA is for and what needs to be included in it, and also consider the concept of a service approach and find out why IT‚Äôs value lies not in equipment and its cost, but in processes and proper management of them. <br><br><h3>  Production secret: a software product for which you will not be ashamed </h3><br>  <b>October 15, 18: 30‚Äì20: 00</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/986/dfd/b6b/986dfdb6b7fc454ba69afe542d948dd6.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Victor Krapivin,</b> architect <br><br>  In a software project, the developer constantly has to work with the inherited code of previously created programs to be completed, corrected or made a source of examples in further practice.  In the process of studying such source code, programmers are often outraged, sometimes not without reason saying: ‚ÄúWell, who writes like that ?!‚Äù.  Numerous incomprehensible solutions, urgent patches for correcting critical errors, ‚Äúcrutches‚Äù - it is not easy to figure it all out even with the documentation, and sometimes it is no longer relevant or it is not at all. <br><br>  Creating a software product that can "live" to industrial operation, you must remember that sooner or later it will fall into the hands of programmers who are not related to its initial development.  In the course of this seminar, we will use examples from the Java world to demonstrate how to create this product in such a way that the ‚Äúdescendants‚Äù are satisfied. <br><br><h3>  ‚ÄúStop!  Who is coming? ": Authentication and authorization in corporate systems </h3><br>  <b>October 22, 18: 30‚Äì21: 30</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a44/13c/2e3/a4413c2e34ac4b559789fd86ebbeae24.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Vladislav Iofe,</b> architect <br><br>  When designing and implementing corporate systems, there are always a number of questions: do we need to develop an access control system ourselves?  How are authentication and authorization built into the application architecture?  Is it possible to make the login easy, convenient and secure at the same time?  What to do with passwords from hundreds of sites? <br><br>  At the seminar, we will look at various methods of authentication and authorization, we will try to circumvent them, as well as get acquainted with industry standards and modern trends in this area in relation to corporate systems.  We will give answers to already asked and many other questions not from the point of view of a security specialist, but from the standpoint of a designer, user, developer, tester and maintenance engineer, and we will pay special attention to architecture and usability. <br><br><h3>  Down with the routine of development!  Software Automation </h3><br>  <b>October 29, 18: 30‚Äì21: 30</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f90/ce5/ca4/f90ce5ca49b84c9fb37b7b1c2be5dd95.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Denis Gavrilov,</b> architect <br>  <b>Igor Shatalkin,</b> .NET developer <br>  <b>Denis Chekushin,</b> leading .NET developer <br><br>  Very often, the main activity of a developer is to automate customer tasks.  However, in the process of work, the programmers themselves often have to deal with the routine: write the same type of code, perform similar operations. <br><br>  What are the means of automation of the programmer?  Why use ORM, autoforms and other similar tools?  What is code generation?  How to write a plugin for Visual Studio?  Where is the automation limit and does it even exist?  At the seminar we will answer these questions and consider how automation is used in everyday practice. <br><br>  Detailed information about the seminars, registration and venue - in our group <a href="https://vk.com/custis_young">VKontakte</a> .  After each meeting, we traditionally upload media reports, presentations and other useful information.  Video recordings of all seminars are available on our <a href="http://vimeo.com/channels/423857">Vimeo</a> channel, and presentations are available at <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/custisppt/presentations">Slideshare</a> . <br><br>  Registration for the first seminar is <a href="http://custis-office.timepad.ru/event/250406/">already open</a> , come yourself and bring friends - we will be glad to see you! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/268057/">https://habr.com/ru/post/268057/</a></p>
