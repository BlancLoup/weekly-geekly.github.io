  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Nanotechnology: in the continuation of the topic of innovation.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Continuing the topic of nanotechnology, I found the article ‚ÄúThe Invisible Market‚Äù, published in the journal ‚ÄúThe <a href="http://www.sf-online.ru/">Secret of the Firm</a> ‚Äù (No. 7 (190) February 26, 2007).  It has several interesting examples of what has already been done. <br>  <b>Who will get the largest market share of $ 1 trillion?</b>  <b>That is exactly what the sales of products based on nanotechnology will bring by 2015.</b>  <b>Corporations are in a hurry to join the race.</b> <br>  ‚ÄúMy attempt to draw attention to the problem was the result <br>  headlines like ‚ÄúThe Prince of Wales scares the nightmare of‚Äú gray goo ‚Äù‚Äù.  TO <br>  I never used this expression and do not believe that <br>  self-replicating robots smaller than a virus are capable of <br>  one day of uncontrolled reproduction destroy our <br>  the planet, "- <b>Prince Charles</b> justified in the pages of The <br>  Independent on Sunday. <br><a name="habracut"></a>  "Gray mucus" (a term coined in 1986 by a doctor <br>  <b>Eric Drexler</b> ) relates to the field of nanotechnology - <br>  science and industry, where the main production <br>  "Brick" is an atom.  Similar scale of construction <br>  allows you to create molecules and, therefore, substances with given <br>  properties, which in practice means the ability to "force" <br>  product to do whatever the developer thinks. <br>  Molecular construction opens up tremendous prospects. <br>  A bacteria-based engine, a dozen transport carts <br>  molecules, a robot ‚Äúsubmarine‚Äù traveling through the veins for <br>  anti-blood clots, cancer cell fighters ... This is just the tip <br>  iceberg.  And, of course, the very ‚Äúnanites‚Äù are self-produced. <br>  nanorobots building their own copies of molecules extracted from <br>  ambient substance.  By the way, they too can be non-hostile. <br>  Such builders are able to design new materials, <br>  giving them amazing properties - from self-reproduction to <br>  self-cleaning and repair. <br>  Since 2004, there has been a real nanotechnology boom in the world.  By <br>  different estimates, the annual amount of public funding in <br>  this area is about $ 5 billion, about the same investment <br>  private business.  It is expected that by 2012 this amount will increase to <br>  $ 600 billion, and in ten years will reach $ 1 trillion, surpassing the markets <br>  electronics, medicine, chemistry and energy. <br>  Russia has every chance not to be left out of this process.  AT <br>  At the end of last year, the Russian government adopted a federal <br>  a nanotechnology development program with a $ 29 billion allocation <br>  rub.  for five years since 2007.  In the fight for the budget already <br>  entered the Moscow, Perm and Saratov regions, presenting <br>  their nanotechnology development programs based on these <br>  regions of high-tech industries and research <br>  centers. <br>  Despite Russia‚Äôs significant lag behind developed countries in <br>  nanotechnology, we already have such an industry.  At the rate <br>  chief editor of the journal "Russian nanotechnology", academic <br>  RAS <b>Mikhail Alfimov,</b> total production, <br>  created using nanotechnology is at level 3 <br>  billion rubles  This mainly applies to semiconductor and <br>  chemical industry. <br>  Today, nanotechnology is mainly used in <br>  the production of materials with desired properties, optics, medicine and <br>  biochemistry, electronics and agriculture.  In the consumer <br>  market, according to average estimates, there are no more than 500 products, <br>  manufactured using nanotechnology.  Non-sticky <br>  "Nanosol", thick, but easily flowing from the bottles "nanoketchup" - <br>  the sphere of nanotechnology from the moment of birth was one step away from <br>  speculation and projecting.  What to look for the consumer on the shelves <br>  Stores now and in the near future?  <b>SF</b> chose the most <br>  interesting nanoproducts. <br>  <b>Nano ball</b> <b><br></b>  "For the time being, you still need to be able to play a little <br>  golf ", - says one of the forum participants <br>  de.rec.sport.golf on Google website the appearance of a new ball under the brand <br>  NDMX from NanoDynamics.  No, he turns 45 degrees <br>  does not know how and he himself will not reach the pocket, either way, but <br>  tells the executive director of the company <b>Kate Blakely,</b> <br>  NDMX-ball will fly farther and more precisely, and it will require an application. <br>  minimal effort. <br><br>  The key to the amazing properties of the ball should be unusual <br>  properties of molecules in the material used for its production. <br>  Company employees say they figured out how to make the ball <br>  control the flight path and torque by adjusting them <br>  change in weight distribution in the shell.  They think they can <br>  save not one spoiled weekend golfers falling into <br>  prostration from uncontrolled flight of the ball.  <b>Frank thomas</b> <br>  former technical director of the US Golf Association, says <br>  "This is probably one of the most important steps in the design of balls <br>  for golf over the past 50 years. "  "The idea is just awesome, only <br>  I do not know if such a ball obeys any laws of physics at all.  AND <br>  most importantly, won't it be banned at competitions? ‚Äùasks a question <br>  on the same golfers forum <b>Mark Reichenbach, a</b> keen player <br>  to golf. <br>  A set of three balls from NanoDynamics costs $ 39.95.  In company <br>  They say that their product is unlikely to shake the positions of such <br>  manufacturers like Wilson, Nike or Titleist, in the market, <br>  estimated at $ 4 billion a year.  ‚ÄúBut if NanoDynamics succeeds <br>  grab and 5% of the market, it will be as much as $ 200 million a year. <br>  Excellent jackpot for yesterday's start-up, "- writes American <br>  columnist <b>John Dvorak</b> in Market Watch. <br>  <b>Nanotechnology</b> <b><br></b>  If you pour milk into a glass, you <br>  found that it is red, do not be alarmed.  It means that <br>  you are faced with Die Innovationsgesellschaft products <br>  GmbH.  "The calculation is correct: we are all accustomed since childhood that red <br>  it is ‚Äústop‚Äù, - the company site visitor comments on the project .‚Äì <br>  Conveniently, if the spoiled product itself will report that it <br>  it's time to go to the trash. " <br>  According to research results, Europeans are ready to pay even more. <br>  It‚Äôs usual for the products to be in the fridge <br>  will follow its own expiration date.  "Now many <br>  products are thrown away just because the packaging is expired <br>  date, ‚Äùsays Dr. <b>Christoph Meily, an</b> expert on <br>  Die Innovationsgesellschaft nanotechnology. - But it‚Äôs not at all <br>  it means that the product is spoiled. "  Much smarter according to <br>  developers, if the consumer was interested not in the date, but in <br>  real quality products.  To help him in this and should <br>  nanoparticles that are able to change the color of the product in response to <br>  appearance in its composition of substances indicating unsuitability <br>  to eat. <br>  "When it comes to adopting new technologies, for <br>  consumers nutrition is the most sensitive area, ‚Äùrecognizes <br>  Christoph Meily  Nevertheless, the emergence of "nano-milk" is already planned <br>  in the next year or two. <br>  <b>Nanoeda</b> <b><br></b>  The world's largest food concerns, such as <br>  Nestle, Kraft and Unilever, although they don‚Äôt like to talk about it, <br>  lead the development of nanotransporters - tiny capsules containing <br>  vitamins, flavoring substances and dyes and those who can give their <br>  cargo by request.  ‚ÄúWilly Wonka - that's who the father of nanoedics.  If you remember <br>  the owner of a chocolate factory invented the gum with a taste of dinner from three <br>  dishes, ‚Äùwrites <b>Alex Renton</b> in Guardian Unlimited. <br>  Scientists paint such a picture: you take pizza nano-preparations and <br>  depending on the temperature in the microwave you get <br>  pizza of a specific taste - mushroom, "four cheeses" or salami. <br>  Experts suggest that these products are turned not only <br>  consumer habits, but the entire food market, as in its <br>  time made it instant food.  Estimated <br>  Helmut Kaiser Consultancy, by 2010 the market of nano-nutrition will be <br>  $ 20.4 billion. Today, more than 200 companies worldwide are <br>  active development in this area.  The United States leads here, behind them <br>  followed by Japan and China.  Estimated by the same Helmut Kaiser <br>  Consultancy, namely Asia, whose population by 2010 will be more than <br>  50% of the world's population will be the largest nano-food market. <br>  <b>Nanoclue</b> <b><br></b>  What do consumers expect from glue?  So he <br>  firmly glued.  And what if the glued one needs to be separated again?  Before <br>  Recently, the rule was: the better the glue, the harder <br>  do it.  And it was even less likely to remove the glue without residue. <br>  Scholars of the Bremen Research <br>  Institute of industrial development and applied materials named <br>  Fraunhofer (IFAM) together with the chemical concern Degussa.  They <br>  have developed a "glue of the future" that is able to acquire or <br>  lose adhesive properties when you press a button.  It happens like this.  AT <br>  ordinary glue add iron oxide placed in a layer of nanoparticles <br>  silicon oxide.  When exposed to high frequency magnetic field <br>  particles oscillate in time with the field, and in seconds the mass <br>  hardens.  For sticking again need high frequency <br>  the magnetic field, with the same frequency, only slightly higher <br>  intensity.  The technology has already been tested in the laboratory, and <br>  before the product was released to the market, only the final tests remained.  "Until <br>  there is only one condition: for the glued thing to work, one of <br>  The parts to be glued must not conduct electricity.  We are many <br>  experimented - the process of nanomagnetic bonding works <br>  with all sorts of combinations of materials, ‚Äùsays <b>Andreas</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Hartwig</b> from IFAM. <br>  <b>Nano TV</b> <b><br></b>  ‚ÄúBy the end of 2006, our monitors on <br>  nanotubes will be in stores, "- promised in 2004, <b>Young</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Jun Jill,</b> Samsung Senior Technologist.  In 2005, Motorola <br>  presented the next prototype of the display - 12 cm in diagonal and 3 mm <br>  thick  Now the company is going to present ready for <br>  mass release product. <br>  Nanotubes - the formation of carbon molecules.  Hollow inside they <br>  possess amazing properties.  With a thickness of several atoms, they <br>  incredibly strong, have good electrical conductivity and <br>  elasticity.  These properties allowed to create a new TV. <br>  generations where nanotubes will become mini-analogues of the usual <br>  electron beam.  Each of them will correspond to its point. <br>  screen, sending there a bunch of three colors, with which <br>  formed a television picture.  This design allows <br>  make a TV just a few millimeters thick, with <br>  HDTV-resolution (grain may be of the order of microns), contrast <br>  up to 100 000: 1 in the absence of a sweep and with power consumption doubled <br>  smaller than before.  At the same time, the cost of displays with 30-inch <br>  screen, as promised by developers from different companies, should <br>  be 30% below the LCD display of the same diagonal. <br>  Following Samsung on similar developments at the end of December 2006 <br>  years, said the concern Sony, created in conjunction with the company Investor <br>  Tex Gate, Field Emission Technologies Inc., total size <br>  investment in which amounted to 16.2 million euros.  Also in the creation <br>  The nanotelevision includes the Toshiba and Canon alliance.  As promised <br>  representatives of both companies, their revolutionary product can <br>  appear already for the 2008 Olympic Games.  Experts suggest <br>  that by this time the market volume will be $ 113.5 billion <br><br></div>
