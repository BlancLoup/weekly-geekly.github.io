  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Yota in the suburbs outside coverage</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I want to talk about my experience connecting Yota in the suburbs, in a place where according to the <a href="http://www.yota.ru/ru/coverage/">official coverage map</a> there is no signal.  This article is useful to those who live or rest near Moscow and at the same time want to use unlimited Internet at an acceptable speed.  I hope it will be clear and interesting for both IT specialists and peaceful summer residents. <br><br>  The system is simple: a relatively powerful parabolic antenna is placed on the house, which is connected to the standard Samsung iota USB modem (connected to a computer or, if necessary, to a router).  The service of ‚Äúunofficial‚Äù connections is offered by several easily guided companies, I chose the one that seemed the most solid - judged by the reviews, the quality of the site and the professionalism of the operators on the phone. <br><br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/8a/df/8adf6813e2f4cf2ff1764ec7ba45d9d3.png" alt="Equipment kit for connecting Yota outside coverage"></a>

      Departure of the master gager costs about 1000 rubles.  If desired, you can also purchase a set of equipment from him. <br><br>  Our house is located about 8 km from Moscow, surrounded by other, rather tall houses, and forest.  To the closest reception area - kilometers 5, no less.  In some places in the village there is a signal, but weak and inconstant. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Test measurements showed an amazing thing - the greatest <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/CINR">CINR</a> was achieved when the antenna was turned in the direction opposite to both Moscow and the closest Yota base tower.  With the ‚Äúrough‚Äù punching out of the house, we and the master achieved a power of 10 dB.  The Yota site was loaded quite quickly: what pages, what a heavy coverage map.  The speed counter, unfortunately, was lying that day - more precisely, the company had a license for it.  But the very presence of the Internet predetermined a positive decision;  those who have to spend large sums on Skylink will understand me. <br><br>  I cannot fail to praise the master - he knows his business, he does not suffer with greed: he did not begin to challenge the installer, honestly saying that you can drill 5 holes in the wall of the house on your own.  And even presented an additional antenna mount kit. <br><br>  Equipment, of course, flew a pretty penny.  ANT-25 antenna (4,200 rubles), <a href="http://www.yota.ru/ru/devices/modems/%3Fsec%3Dusb">Samsung SWC-U200</a> modem (2,390 rubles), microwave antenna cable (5 m, 1,500 rubles), <a href="http://www.d-link.ru/ru/products/5/786.html">D-Link DIR-320</a> router with Yota firmware (3 490 rubles.), A pigtail from a cable to a modem (950 rubles) and an antenna bracket (450 rubles).  Total - almost 13,000, plus the call of the master.  For each device is given invoice, check and two-week warranty. <br><br>  The master left, and the antenna perfectly settled on the mount of another antenna - television.  Finding the best reception point is not an easy task, because the CINR jumps almost unsystematically: in the same position, oscillations can reach 10-15 dB - with a maximum of 25!  Nevertheless, it was possible to ensure that this ratio did not fall below 10 - when the antenna was raised as high as possible.  The cable was stretched through the window, a thin wire was connected to it to connect to the modem - a pigtail. <br><br>  A separate story with the fastening of the pigtail to the modem.  In the small USB ‚Äúwhistle‚Äù there are two ma-a-ahonkie nests for an external antenna - a pigtail is inserted into one of them, and the other end is connected to a thick antenna cable.  All this is fraught with breakage of the socket, so I recommend that you immediately fix the cable. <br><br>  Opening a Samsung modem is also not an easy task, only a table knife coped with it and hooked a gray lid on the upper sidewall ( <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/missterr/" class="user_link">missTerr</a> notices that everything opens without any problems with a sure shift towards thickening).  She left with a wild crash, but none of the fixings broke.  Inside there is another cover covering the microcircuit directly.  It contains a sticker with technical information.  Do not repeat my mistake - no need to remove the inner cover.  There are two holes in the cover, covered with a protective film.  Unclip it by freeing the one closest to the ‚ÄúSamsung‚Äù badge on the sticker and carefully, without effort, attach the pigtail to it.  After all these actions, the official warranty on the modem, of course, disappears. <br><br>  The modem can be connected to a computer, it will be defined as a CD-ROM, and install Yota Access from it - drivers and a convenient CINR meter and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Received_signal_strength_indication">RSSI are</a> protected into this program.  But if the Internet needs to be shared, then, having adjusted the antenna, connect the modem to the router - it has a USB connector, originally intended for printers. <br><br>  All settings are sewn into the router - by the way, the firmware in it for Asus, do not be surprised.  For people from IT distant, detailed step-by-step instructions are attached to the device, and the experienced people will not experience a password change for Wi-Fi.  It is possible to register forwarding ports, assign IP to MAC address, available - support for DynDNS.  Well, the rest of the "gentleman's set."  It is possible to reset the settings in the "factory", while the firmware under Yota will disappear. <br><br>  The activation of the modem (binding of the MAC address to the personal account) and payment are described step by step on the Yota website.  For those who doubt, or simply there is little money available, there is a tariff of 50 rubles.  per day;  and so - 900 rubles.  per month. <br><br>  How's the speed?  In different ways, but you can live very much.  At ‚Äúbad‚Äù moments, download 0.6 Mb / s, at night about 2 Mb / s to download and 0.4 to upload.  The pages are loaded without brakes, the streaming audio is the same, but the video comes to ‚Äúpre-load‚Äù about half of the video before viewing (this is YouTube and the resolution is 360p).  For 5 night hours, almost 3 GB of torrents downloaded.  As for the toys, the trial network ride at Burnout Paradise went without a hitch. <br><br>  Summarizing, I‚Äôll say that we don‚Äôt regret the purchase - the whole family uses the Internet, the connection is stable, there are no gaps, you don‚Äôt need to shake for the spent megabytes.  The whole system will pay off in 2-3 months, so even if problems arise in winter, the purchase will be repaid. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8ae/ae2/3cb/8aeae23cbbb9d14c378a67db6c5d90a9.png" alt="Speed ‚Äã‚ÄãTest 1"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/62e/f46/b19/62ef46b19fca7a7745d456bd0d2c077f.png" alt="Speed ‚Äã‚ÄãTest 2"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/570/347/dc4/570347dc4d3dcd0008f0daeb8c9b12eb.png"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/95404/">https://habr.com/ru/post/95404/</a></p>
