During this time, an invaluable feedback was received from the players.  It was an order of criticism, mostly constructive, as well as quite a few sensible tips / suggestions.  All this helped to outline the key problem areas and directions for development. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In addition, a sufficient amount of statistical data was collected for their analysis.  One of the key points was that the core of a loyal audience with a high degree of repeated visits was made by users playing from mobile devices.  Trying to clarify this moment, I heard comments in the spirit - ‚Äúit‚Äôs convenient that once I opened the game in the tab of my mobile browser, I can play even outside the coverage of mobile Internet‚Äù.  Taking into account this fact, the visualization of the playing field and game elements has been reworked to meet the needs of the "target audience". <br><br>  The process of using algorithms like ‚Äúwashing machine‚Äù and similar ones is significantly complicated.  The ability to use light strategies to play almost indefinitely and at the same time gain a lot of points - the leader among the players' complaints.  Solved by the introduction of a system of penalties for repeatedly repeating the same type of combination.  For each series of "suspicious" moves the player receives a penalty point.  Every ten scoring penalties complicate the gameplay.  The game is complicated by increasing the number of added blocks at each subsequent step.

      Victory conditions added.  In the original version, the gameplay did not pursue any particular goal, which caused a flurry of discontent from the players.  At the moment there are two ways to achieve the cherished goal - to hold 400 moves in the game or to score 5000 game points.  The task is not simple ... <br><br>  Added a brief guide for beginners.  Users who came into the game not from publishing to Habr√©, where it was described what and how to do, were lost and could not immediately understand the essence of the game.  Now the user is always on hand a hint with the rules of the game and the ways of interaction for his type of device. <br><br>  Game <a href="https://shtange.github.io/bushed-bricks/">Bushed Bricks</a> .  <a href="https://github.com/shtange/bushed-bricks">Game sources are</a> available on GitHub. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> I would be glad if you have a desire to take part in the development of the project - in the format of criticism / advice or code in the repository on GitHub. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/320560/">https://habr.com/ru/post/320560/</a></p>
