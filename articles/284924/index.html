  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Kaspersky dealt with the "juridicals"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Kaspersky Lab has been successfully fighting patent trolls for a long time.  In 2012 and 2013, the company <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/kaspersky/blog/200210/">told</a> how it crushed several extortionists.  She continues to resist new trolls, although most foreign competitors prefer to negotiate with them amicably, so as not to spend money on litigation costs.  But for a Russian firm, this seems to be a matter of principle. <br><br>  Today, Evgeny Kaspersky in his personal blog told <a href="http://eugene.kaspersky.ru/2015/01/20/yuridasty-v-galstukax/">about one more success in the legal field</a> .  In addition to the patent trolls, the company managed to win a lawsuit against the so-called ‚Äúlawyers in ties‚Äù.  We are talking about law firms that file class lawsuits against manufacturers of consumer goods, collect a large army of "victims" and demand compensation for each of them, as well as the payment of a fine. <br><br>  This business model is also called "consumer terrorism" (industry turnover is <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm%3Fabstract_id%3D1442108">$ 6-8 billion per year</a> ).  And now the Russian company has become the target of ‚Äúterrorists‚Äù.  But not those attacked. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Further, the word Eugene (published with small cuts).

    <blockquote>  Exactly one year ago, we received a claim from a certain Barbara Makhovits and her representative of the law firm Edelson to our <a href="https://eugene.kaspersky.ru/2013/03/22/kazhdyj-dvadcatyj-uvy-da/">free KSS scanner (Kaspersky Security Scan)</a> .  Allegedly, KSS fraudulently forced the victim to ‚Äúpurchase a commercial license of an antivirus product.‚Äù <br><br>  How we were defamed in a statement and called out in any way I will not write.  Indecent. <br><br>  KSS scans your computer for malware and suspicious programs, system and application vulnerabilities, the correctness of settings and other features that may affect the security of your computer.  According to the results of Ms. Makhovits' computer scan, I did not find the product of viruses, but I found a whole bunch of vulnerabilities, including dangerous settings of Windows and Internet Explorer, autorun from flash drives and CD, saving cookies, caching data received via https.  Well, and, accordingly, issued the verdict "Perhaps the computer is under threat, problems are discovered." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ea1/c00/30d/ea1c0030d085461d945618fa25b4742d.jpg"><br><br>  Yeah, it was because of this message that Edelson accused us of intimidating users!  It seems like an unpatched browser is not a threat, and the antivirus can only protect against viruses, and if there are no viruses on the computer, then there is no need to defend oneself.  OK‚Ä¶ <br><br>  I believe that readers do not need to prove that the antivirus protects far from it only viruses and the concept of ‚Äúthreat‚Äù goes far beyond the scope of malware.  But the court is the court and there often have to prove that you are not a camel. <br><br>  We have prepared a detailed justification for each of the 112 "non-viral" vulnerabilities that KSS considers a threat.  They brought real cases of malware that use them to infiltrate the system.  They even prepared a stand for ‚Äúlive‚Äù demonstration to the court of attack scenarios through these vulnerabilities and protection against such attacks with the help of KIS.  In general, everything is laid out on the shelves for a reasoned proof of their position.  Out of habit, Edelson tried to overwhelm us with additional requests - we quickly and clearly answered everything, slightly replied :) and suddenly there was an unexpectedly interesting: the plaintiff ... was gone! <br><br>  Yeah, I just disappeared and I no longer contacted my lawyers.  What really happened there is unknown to me, but the fact remains that the lawsuit was withdrawn! <br><br>  Yes, a certain amount of money was spent, to return it in any way, but they were definitely not wasted. <br><br>  These (and others like them) got a good slap signal that ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt need to go here,‚Äù there is no easy money here.  And all anti-virus developers are now available working case to combat legal extortion.  And if these (or the like) guys have already begun to blackmail you - write in a personal, we will help! </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/284924/">https://habr.com/ru/post/284924/</a></p>
