  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Russian YouTube is open to talents and partners.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <strong>Today, YouTube officially presented the Russian-language version of its service.</strong>  <strong>The YouTube service is fully translated into Russian, has a localized homepage and search engine.</strong>  <strong>On the website <a href="http://ru.youtube.com/">www.youtube.com,</a> Russian users will be able not only to search, view and share the most interesting videos, but also to communicate with other Russian- <a href="http://ru.youtube.com/">speaking</a> users.</strong> <br><br>  Patrick Walker, head of the video partnership of Google, in an interview for Habrahabr noted that the opening of the Russian version of YouTube is very important for the company: in Russia there is growing interest in both YouTube and video services in general. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The YouTube team, of course, was aware of rumors spread on Runet about the launch date of the localized service.  Patrick Walker called these speculations essentially baseless: the work on the Russian version was carried out for a long time, but the service opened today is not just a ‚Äútranslation into Russian‚Äù, but a full search, access to the rating of the most viewed videos, professional content providers (YouTube concluded agreements with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/1tv">Channel One</a> , <a href="http://www.youtube.com/tnt">TNT</a> , <a href="http://www.youtube.com/ctctv">STS</a> , <a href="http://www.youtube.com/7tv">7TV</a> , <a href="http://www.youtube.com/2x2">22</a> , <a href="http://www.youtube.com/russiatoday">Russia Today</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/euronewsru">Euronews</a> ), etc. <br><br>  Quite serious work has been done on legal aspects.  The legal basis for the work of YouTube in Russia will be dealt with by a separate team of specialists, although the developers also rely on users who may mark certain videos as violating the rules of service.

      YouTube is open for cooperation: Patrick Walker noted that the Russian YouTube team does not plan to dwell on the existing partnership agreements with TV channels.  And for webmasters and programmers, as well as on other Google services, an API is available. <br><br>  The head of the video services Google is already familiar with the work of Peter Nalich, whose <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DAOzkN8dHnjk">clip Guitarr is</a> extremely popular among Russian-speaking users of YouTube.  Patrick Walker noted that Nalich is popular not only with Russians, but also with foreign users, and hopes that using YouTube, other talented musicians, like Peter, can quickly find their audience.  According to the developers, the Russian version of YouTube is not only a place to store video clips, but also a kind of ‚Äúwindow to the world.‚Äù <br><br>  The work on the Google video search engine does not stop either: Russian users will soon be able to see a fully localized version of Google Video, which already now indexes a part of Russian video services. <br><br>  Patrick Walker wished success to video hosting services in Russia, noting that there are certain national peculiarities in each country - and therefore it‚Äôs realistic to compete with YouTube.  Despite the fact that YouTube provides a lot of opportunities to its users, Russian video services can always do something better. <br><br>  Askar Tuganbaev, head of <a href="http://rutube.ru/">Rutube.ru</a> , says that there‚Äôs nothing wrong with opening the Russian version of YouTube: <br><br><blockquote>  The difference is that now even idiots who find it difficult to navigate the English-language site can use YouTube. <br><br>  The opening of the Russian YouTube was quite expected: after all, manufacturers of dishes and tobacco products are entering the Russian market.  So producers need new markets, the Russian market is attractive - everything is logical.  Someone strongly influenced by the attractiveness of the Western brand and huge advertising budgets, for someone - no.  Our friendly team will continue its work;  we do not have advertising budgets, we invest all the money in development.  Time will put everything in its place: there is a company acting in the interests of American shareholders, and there is a Russian team developing business in our country. </blockquote><br><br>  Rutube plans will change a bit due to today's event.  ‚ÄúWe are currently testing several innovations,‚Äù says Askar.  ‚ÄúWe have, for example, a file uploader, similar to that on Youtube.  Apparently, we will have to release our new features a little earlier. ‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/16131/">https://habr.com/ru/post/16131/</a></p>
