  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Computer card games: streamers that are worth paying attention to</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Kind time of the day, fans of computer entertainment.  In our world, computer games and streaming platforms go hand in hand.  If you regularly immerse yourself in the atmosphere of virtual worlds, then you probably also watch how others do it.  This becomes very important in the case when the game involves a certain degree of rivalry, that is, it is a ‚Äúcyber discipline‚Äù.  Just one of these disciplines became collectible card games (CCI). <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/288132/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4b5/738/a36/4b5738a3627543f3aa6083db5cd89033.jpg"></a> <a name="habracut"></a>  <i>Posted by: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/robscomputer/6248194455/">Robert Freiberger</a> / <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC</a></i> <br><br>  Watching the matches of professional players, you are ‚Äúpumping‚Äù your skills.  What decisions does a professional make?  What cards are thrown off during a mulligan?  When exchanges creatures?  When is fold?  You, passing all these decisions through a prism of own experience, improve the game.  Moreover, professional "gamblers" often use the most powerful and interesting decks - no one will mind if you borrow an idea :)

      Considering the above, I prepared a small selection of CCI streamers (domestic and foreign), which, in my humble opinion, should be noted.  I note that the collection includes people whom I watch myself.  They always comment on what is happening on the gaming table, share their thoughts, do not hesitate to make a joke and, this is important, limit themselves to using profanity. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  Magic: The Gathering Online </h2><br>  I would like to start with the most famous card game.  The developers have tried to transfer the experience from the game in Magic: The Gathering to the digital space.  All aspects have been preserved - from the construction of decks to tournaments.  Even the boosters still have to pay.  Here are a couple of streamers and channels in this segment: <br><br><h4>  1) Magic: The Gathering [ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8ZGymAvfP97qJabgqUkz4A">YouTube</a> ] [ <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/magic">Twitch</a> ] </h4><br>  The official channel of Magic: The Gathering - without it, in this case, nowhere.  The guys present new sets of cards, publish video tutorials, interviews, and also broadcast the matches of the best players in Magic.  No cost and without the classic examples of the work of decks in the "field conditions": <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_183lNXZl3s" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h4>  2) AJ Sacher [ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC23tYW6q5IRinekSydezl_A">YouTube</a> ] [ <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/ajsacher">Twitch</a> ] </h4><br>  AJ is a writer, caster, streamer and content maker who is seriously interested in many card games.  One of them is "Magic."  A lot of effort makes to create educational videos.  Here is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D0qo2M5Tf1Gw">an example of an</a> interesting video - the most complete analysis of the game mechanic, a review of the playing field, and so on. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  Hearthstone </h2><br>  Next on the list is the ‚Äúgun‚Äù of 2014, a game that rarely leaves the top three on Twitch.  This is Hearthstone: Heroes of WarCraft.  Blizzard was able to take the existing concept of card games and refine it - as a card game, it became easier, but significantly acquired in entertainment.  So, to the list of streamers: <br><br><h4>  1) Trump [ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TrumpSC">YouTube</a> ] [ <a href="https://d.docs.live.net/3ce1778315e9730e/%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%258B/Gaming/Twitch">Twitch</a> ] </h4><br>  Trump began his career as a StarCraft II player, but quickly moved onto the Hearthstone stage.  He is the first on this list, because it can rightfully be considered the grandfather of Hartstone - Jeffrey (his real name) is streaming since the launch of the beta test of the project.  He also participated in the first Hearthstone World Championship. <br><br>  Trump remains a kind of ‚Äúguiding star‚Äù for beginners, recording training videos.  His basic decks remain a great help for novice players, and the F2P Challenge video series shows that everyone can achieve high ranks without investing money into the game.  During matches, he always explains his moves, squeezing the maximum out of any situation.  And do not hesitate to "dilute" the news feed with your playing the piano. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.twitch.tv/" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h4>  2) NoxiousGLHF [ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/NoxiousHearthstone">YouTube</a> ] [ <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/noxious_hs">Twitch</a> ] </h4><br>  Noxious is also a veteran of the Hearthstone scene and has fun to the masses with open beta testing.  Unlike other streamers, Noxious follows the ‚Äúfun first‚Äù rule, therefore, it does not set itself the goal to reach high ranks or gain maximum victories in the arena.  That is why in his time he invented the Randuin Wrynn deck, completely built on the elements of randomness. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4NSzLXOcPFs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  In his opinion, the best deck is an unusual deck, even an unexpected one, which takes opponents by surprise and generates interesting interactions on the game table. <br><br><h4>  3) Tomatos [ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtar_hVOtXpCdR0u3bKjtRA">YouTube</a> ] [ <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/tomatosmuchachos">Twitch</a> ] </h4><br>  Alexey ‚ÄúTomat‚Äù is the only Russian-speaking streamer from those presented in this section, which makes him honor.  He likes to call the ‚ÄúHartstown police‚Äù and generates many positive and funny moments on the stream.  In his case, I suggest just to watch the cutting of the best videos for 2016.  Enjoy. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4eK5BX4JsCc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h4>  4) Kripparrian [ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Kripparrian">YouTube</a> ] [ <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/nl_kripp">Twitch</a> ] </h4><br>  Kripp played many high-level games and did (still does) videos on them.  He was one of two players who first defeated Diablo in Diablo III on the Inferno Hardcore difficulty level, and he was also banned from Neverwinter and Guild Wars 2 for being smarter than the economics of virtual universes. <br><br>  As a good player, he also showed himself in Hearthstone.  He does not ask viewers for money and subscriptions to the channel, he just likes to play games with people.  He is absolutely brilliant when it comes to finding incredible moves, thanks to a clear understanding of the mechanic "Hartstouna". <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VH1i9awgVxc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  For example, in the video above, Kripp talks about a possible scenario when a player wins a match in three moves (something unprecedented).  Just a week later, his ‚Äúprophecy‚Äù comes true during the stream number one on the list - Trump. <br><br><h4>  5) Day9 [ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/day9tv">YouTube</a> ] [ <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/day9tv">Twitch</a> ] </h4><br>  Sean Day9 Plott also came to Hearthstone from Starcraft.  Charismatic, smart, always makes smile.  Calling Sean a professional Hearthstone player doesn‚Äôt turn his tongue, as he often makes mistakes due to active interaction with the chat.  I reached the legend only once and constantly played with non-playable decks (the infamous Shadow Priest). <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/utaWZT5N-tQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  But all the ‚Äúknights‚Äù, as he calls his subscribers, still love him.  He is valued for his stunning open nature and great stories.  No wonder he was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/5doltp/day9_seems_to_have_won_the_golden_joystick_awards/">awarded the</a> award "Person of the Year." <br><br><hr><br><h2>  Gwent </h2><br>  Gwent is another collectible card game that is quickly gaining popularity.  Guint has replaced the bones and poker from the first and second parts of the game The Witcher, and now has been reborn as an independent project.  This CCI is very different from the rest in terms of a mechanic, which makes it more interesting.  Many streamers from the previous section tried to play Guint, but he brought new faces to the streaming arena. <br><br><h4>  1) Sherl Lightning [ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnWalZv3jOhzFIZwSM4Eflw">YouTube</a> ] [ <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/sherlightning">Twitch</a> ] </h4><br>  This is Ruslan, he publishes a video not only on ‚ÄúGwint‚Äù, but he pays a lot of attention to this card game.  It is very pleasant to watch him for the simple reason that he calmly explains everything that happens on the table. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aqilDD0xzzI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  It does not bother with cutting the video, laying out the recordings of streams "as is".  I can not say that this is good, because sometimes watching a three-hour video is sometimes problematic, but I have my own charm - you can get the most complete ‚Äúexperience‚Äù from what is happening on a live show. <br><br><h4>  2) KingBlackToof [ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxZnSkDHvtVhwzcJU5DEjNA">YouTube</a> ] [ <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/kingblacktoof">Twitch</a> ] </h4><br>  If it's time to play Guint, this guy is the best choice.  KBT tries to make each of its videos interesting and at the same time teach players something.  He likes to devote specific video to the features of one card, revealing all aspects of the game, giving various combinations and, of course, real examples from his matches.  In this video, he talks about NACK: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xt7OJlC-6eI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  His channel does not do without the latest news from the developers: about upcoming patches, events in the studio, new maps, and so on. <br><br><h4>  3) Merchant [ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3ZqFbpwxyp-sseip6nD9Iw">YouTube</a> ] [ <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/rsmerchant">Twitch</a> ] </h4><br>  His channel is the place to go first if you need a good deck.  Detailed analysis of the mechanic, a variety of factions, examples of games with comments. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YbOVLa9fIpE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Merchant began streaming ‚ÄúGwint‚Äù from the first days after the beta was released, and although it ranks third on this list, it quickly became one of my favorite content makers.  It is interesting to watch, but even more interesting to listen to - he is the owner of a stunning deep voice, which takes the viewing experience to a new level. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  Duelyst </h2><br>  This project also stands out a bit from the general list, since it is not a collectible card game 100%.  Duelyst is a turn-based tactical strategy with KKI elements and curious pixel graphics.  The game has a kind of plot - a story that explains what is happening on the battlefield - and an amazing musical component, here's an example of music: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bBdVSntbVEQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Well, here's a list of streamers that you should pay attention to: <br><br><h4>  1) MegaMogwai [ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvUZXLShMx-FZvoadtb8xBQ">YouTube</a> ] [ <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/megam0gwai">Twitch</a> ] </h4><br>  Spanish guy MegaMogwai just loves to play card games.  Duelyst video he began to do in partnership with Counterplay Games, game developers, and the result of their cooperation was a good series of training videos.  I give the first part below: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zXaStZZzaHs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Stream recordings are no less interesting to watch, because after making a move, he explains why he did it this way: he puts everything on the shelves, "predicts" the likely consequences and reaction of the opponent. <br><br><h4>  2) Brian Kibler [ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCItISwABVRjboRSBBi6WYTA">YouTube</a> ] [ <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/bmkibler">Twitch</a> ] </h4><br>  Brian Kibler is quite a significant figure in the world of CCI.  He started with Magic: The Gathering, where he had a great success.  Then he switched to other card games and went into eSports - many could see him in tournaments in ‚ÄúHearthstone‚Äù, to which he is now spending more time.  However, does not bypass the side and "Duelist".  Here is his latest video: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_-xly_cM3_I" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h4>  3) NoxiousGLHF [ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/NoxiousHearthstone">YouTube</a> ] [ <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/noxious_hs">Twitch</a> ] </h4><br>  And again Noxious.  He began streaming ‚ÄúDuelist‚Äù in the Paid Promotion format, but he liked the project, because he continued his interaction with him. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rCP3zJNpS4U" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  In each of the videos he produces, he offers the viewer a new deck, explains the main combos and plays a couple of matches with explanations. <br><br><hr><br>  <i>On this, perhaps, everything.</i>  <i>I will note that many worthy people were not included in the list: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/amazhs">Amaz</a> , <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/strifecro">StrifeCro</a> , <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMu3_s7WCRCJrbh37UKmJ-A">FireBat</a> , <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/naurplay">Naur</a> , <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCniSlgdtltH4S2Z1LuG_jsA">LifeCoach</a> and others (for the same ‚ÄúDuelist‚Äù the guys on Reddit picked up a long <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duelyst/comments/43xc4l/good_twitch_streamer_for_duelyst/">list</a> ).</i>  <i>They did not get here for various reasons, but perhaps some of you will like them.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/403229/">https://habr.com/ru/post/403229/</a></p>
