This does not apply to all companies - "Chinese" with its backlash, deception, non-working elements and other pleasures are still very much. <br><br>  But the same Xiaomi, Lenovo, BBK (Vivo, Oppo), Meizu, Huawei and other companies from China have long become independent corporations that produce their own high-quality products sold worldwide.  Relatively recently, Onda joined these brands.  Its engineers used to honestly copy Apple products, with a much lower price tag.  Now Onda has begun to produce independent products.  Let's see what this stuff is. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This is mainly about tablets, with good quality and excellent performance.  But there are also laptops in the company's range, and their design can be called quite successful, and their characteristics are quite good.  The main thing here is also the price at which, after the growth of the dollar rate, domestic buyers began paying particular attention.  Prices are more or less, let's say.

      Let's look at the tablets. <br><br><h3>  Onda V989 Air </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/53f/be9/c5a/53fbe9c5a15b1bed4c83e22fc0e31c8e.jpg" width="750"><br><br>  As usual, here is Android.  The display diagonal is 9.7 inches, the resolution is 2048 * 1536, the pixel density is 264 per inch. <br><br>  As for the internals, they are represented by the Allwinner A83T processor, the PowerVR SGX544 graphics chip and the 2 GB RAM module.  The internal memory here is 32 GB.  True, the part is occupied by the operating system. <br><br>  There is a rear camera, there is a front camera.  Communication modules - WiFi and Bluetooth. <br><br>  The price of this miracle of technology is <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/hu">$ 132.99 on Ali *</a> . <br><br><h3>  Onda V719 3G </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/991/f0e/95f/991f0e95f8080f5cf63ad0074bb093c2.jpg"><br><br>  This is one of the most budget tablet models of the company.  For a small amount of $ 80-90 (depending on the store), the buyer receives a 7-inch tablet with a SIM card slot and the ability to make calls.  This, in fact, the ceiling (tablet). <br><br>  The characteristics of the device are very modest, but for work or watching movies with surfing they are enough.  There is a rear and front camera, there is a MediaTek MT8312 processor, plus a Mali-400 MP2 video accelerator. <br><br>  There is little RAM here, only 512 MB, so it‚Äôs better not to run any heavy applications here.  But again, if you just need to watch a movie and rummage on the Web, plus making calls is just what you need. <br><br>  The price of the tablet is about <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/hv">$ 72 on Ali *</a> . <br><br><h3>  Onda V919 AIR CH (with Windows 10) </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/07a/08b/246/07a08b246db4cfc1ebaf76b4fc18a0ad.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  One of the most powerful tablets of the company, equipped with a powerful Intel Atom x5-z8500 Cherry Trail processor (1.84 Hz).  The tablet is very productive, thanks to the processor, and video adapter and the presence of 4 GB of RAM. <br><br>  The internal memory here is 64 GB, which should be enough for any tablet user, plus it is possible to use memory cards.  There are cameras, there are two of them - there are 5 MP rear camera with flash, there is a front camera with 2 MP. <br><br>  The diagonal of the display is 9.7 inches, with a resolution of 2048 * 1536 pixels. <br><br>  For all that, the battery has a capacity of 8000 mAh.  The weight of the tablet is about 450 g. <br><br>  There is a card reader, there are wireless memory modules, plus a Micro USB connector with the ability to connect peripheral USB devices. <br><br>  This is one of the most productive tablets of the company, which costs less ( <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/hw">about $ 172 *</a> on Ali) than the counterparts of better-known manufacturers from the United States.  The design is not bad, the assembly is of high quality, what else does a user need for happiness? <br><br><h3>  Laptop transformer Onda oBook 11 </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d09/8ff/6a5/d098ff6a52237ff5254d6a6b82be420a.png"><br><br>  As mentioned above, Onda began to produce not only tablets, but also laptops.  One of the interesting examples is the Onda oBook 11 model, which can work both as a laptop and as a tablet (running Windows 10). <br><br>  Inside the hybrid device, an Intel Atom x5-Z8300 processor is installed, plus 2 GB of RAM, 32 GB of internal memory. <br><br>  A battery with a capacity of 8000 mAh can work offline for many hours.  The display diagonal is 11.6 inches, and the screen resolution is 1920 * 1080.  The weight of the gadget is about 1.2 kg. <br><br>  No matter how much you are looking for such a transformer for games (although indie toys - why not?), But for work - completely.  Well, the price also does not really bite (although everything is relative, of course) - this is about <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/hx">$ 210 on Ali *</a> . <br><br><h3>  Onda V919 3G Air (Windows 10 + Android) </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c78/c5f/0ac/c78c5f0aca8b9bc44e2d4c3509d4101f.jpg"><br><br>  Another interesting device that supports both work with Windows 10 and work with Android.  The manufacturer has provided the possibility of using both of these systems.  Switching between systems is carried out by pressing one button. <br><br>  Inside is a good stuffing, Intel's 64-bit quad-core processor - Baytrail-T Z3735F 64 X86 with a core operating frequency of 2.16 GHz.  Plus the amount of RAM in 2 GB, plus an internal memory of 64 GB and the ability to add a memory card. <br><br>  For lovers of pofotkat or take a video there is a 5 MP camera with autofocus, plus a front camera available. <br><br>  There is also a SIM card slot, and this is another useful feature of the device.  The user can either work on the 3G network or make calls. <br><br>  This device can not be called cheap, but again, its price is lower than the cost of a similar device of more well-known manufacturers.  The price is about <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/hy">$ 170 on Ali *</a> . <br><br>  <b>As output</b> .  Overall, Onda is no stranger to the market for electronic devices.  But active development began only recently: new tablet models are emerging, transforming laptops are added to the range.  The company is expanding and trying to work quality. <br><br>  Onda tablets can be used as an anti-crisis solution - if such a tablet can do the same thing as Apple, Samsung and more well-known companies, why pay more? <br><br>  That's all, with you there was a simple service for choosing sophisticated <a href="https://dronk.ru/">Dronk.Ru</a> equipment.
