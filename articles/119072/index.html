Even to invent a good gift, or to solve the problem ‚ÄúWhat should I wear?‚Äù A girl takes far less power!  It is clear - he gave the gift, and then you can not worry, and you can wear the second dress tomorrow.  With the selected name - live and face every day. <br><br>  At some point we decided that it was time to change the working title of our project to the present.  For more than a month we came up with different names, twisted them like that, and, of course, rejected them.  Much was discussed verbally - but the main discussion was conducted on the forum, and therefore we can bring to your attention a note about how this happened with us. <br><br>  I think not everyone will be able to carefully read the entire chronicle, it is too big.  But even if you just flip through the post, it will be easier for you when you yourself encounter the agony of choosing a name: you will know that you are not alone. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br> <a href="http://foto.delfi.ua/picture/425006/"><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/13f/7ee/a30/13f7eea3052052a8a4725687019dfc81.jpg" alt="History of one name" width="300" height="225"></a>  <i>The story is conducted on behalf of Igor Kryltsov</i>

      After reading Jason Cohen <a href="http://blog.asmartbear.com/naming-startup.html">'s</a> post <a href="http://blog.asmartbear.com/naming-startup.html">‚ÄúNaming your startup: Settle down, it's cool!‚Äù</a> , I remembered reading <a href="http://onstartups.com/tabid/3339/bid/12156/How-To-Pick-A-Company-Name-Tips-From-The-Trenches.aspx">‚ÄúHow To Pick A Company Name: Tips From The Trenches‚Äù</a> and <a href="http://onstartups.com/tabid/3339/bid/17702/17-Mutable-Suggestions-For-Naming-A-Startup.aspx">‚Äú17 Mutable Suggestions For Naming A Startup‚Äù</a> , and even the full version <a href="http://www.igorinternational.com/process/naming-guide-product-company-names.php">from Igor</a>  Memories of how we came up with a name were still fresh in our memory.  Besides, I had never met a detailed story about inventing a name before - and the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis post was born. <br><br>  As you understand, English for some of us is the second, or even the third.  And we, of course, chose the name English, and therefore if some options seem ridiculous or cool-associated to our English-speaking readers, you will know that they sound great in Russian and don‚Äôt smell like that. <br><br>  Now a few words about the subject area. <br><br>  Deep Shift Labs is the name of our team, and therefore the product name consonant with the words 'deep' or 'shift' would be good, from our point of view. <br>  Selenium - our product uses <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a> , and therefore the full or partial (root or suffix) presence of this word would not be bad either. <br>  Test-ing - our service performs automatic functional tests and therefore such a word may be present in the name. <br>  Cloud, Elastic, Virtual - the system creates a virtual environment consisting of 10, or 100, or ... machine testers. <br>  Bug, Error - here it is clear, this is what we are looking for - bugs, errors. <br><br>  This is, I would say, a <i>semantic shell</i> .  Probably, in search of a name, it is wise to always start with it.  This was not recorded explicitly in our country, but, as you will see, all discussions revolved mostly around these words. <br><br>  By the time we started discussing the name in January 2010, we had already been working on the project for a year and a half, and therefore we were looking for a name for an already living system.  The system is made in the time free from contract work.  From the very beginning of the work, the name Trillium consonant with Selenium stuck to it.  The word also contains the letter 'T' from Testing, but unfortunately, <a href="">it turned out</a> <sup>*</sup> that there are a lot of people who want to use this name, and besides, it is very close to the name of the popular <a href="http://www.trillian.im/">Trillian</a> chat client from Cerulean Studios.  We started talking about the new name, because we decided that we could invent a better name for which the domain would be free.  As soon as inspiration appeared, we again and again generated names, and these dialogues are listed below with minor authoring changes. <br><br>  In the discussion took part: <br>  <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/igorkryltsov">Igor</a> <br>  <a href="http://ua.linkedin.com/pub/yakubovskiy-dmitriy/10/b34/4ba">Dima</a> <br>  <a href="http://ua.linkedin.com/pub/alexander-savchenko/3/6b3/516">Sasha</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/olegkiselev">Oleg</a> - to be brief and not to go into the history of our 8-year-old acquaintance - Oleg Kiselyov helps us with practical advice, when our questions are interesting to him and intersect with his knowledge and experience.  We consider him an advisor and therefore we ask questions ... not often :) <br><br>  <strong>Mon</strong>  <strong>Jan.</strong>  <strong>11, 2010 11:14 am - Igor</strong> <br>  Trillium - currently used <br><br>  ShiftOS or ShiftOs or Shiftos <br>  ShiftOZ or ShiftOz or Shiftoz - Australia - <a href="http://in.answers.yahoo.com/question/index%3Fqid%3D20080731014435AAZHowE">Oz</a> <br>  Shiftoid - fictional <br><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/52b/cbf/737/52bcbf737920aedbf4706ce27c71e90b.jpg" width="229" height="140"><br>  Selenoid - fictional <br>  Selenius - fictional <br><br>  Selenium - Selenium <br>  Selenite - Selenite (calcium sulfate dihydrate) <br>  Selenide - Selenide (hydrochloric acid salt) <br>  Selenosis - selenium poisoning <br>  Selenious - selenium <br><br>  Gridder - a player <br><br>  Found and immediately dropped (the dangerous word - test, as it turned out): <br>  Testaceous - having a hard shell or shell-like outer covering <br>  Testa - the protective outer covering of a seed. <br>  Testee - one who takes or has been taken a test. <br>  Testoid - testosterone or androsterone, that promotes male characteristics. <br>  Testis - an organ which produces sperm. <br><br>  <strong>W.</strong>  <strong>Jan.</strong>  <strong>19, 2010 9:08 pm - Dima</strong> <br><br>  <i>The parallel logo topic was discussed in a parallel topic, where we immediately appeared on a chameleon - it catches bugs (even at a great distance, like our system), changes color, looks in all directions.</i>  <i>Therefore, among the options will come across words intersecting with the word chameleon</i> <br><br>  Chameleon is also a cool character.  And you tail, and language, and bugs, and color changes. <br><br>  <strong>Mon</strong>  <strong>Jan.</strong>  <strong>18, 2010 2:19 pm - Igor</strong> <br><br>  Two names that sound like chameleon + selenium: <br><br>  Seleon - fictional <br>  <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/selion">Selion</a> <br><br>  <strong>Wed</strong>  <strong>Jan.</strong>  <strong>20, 2010 11:45 am - Igor</strong> <blockquote>  Dima: ‚ÄúChameleon is also a cool character.  And you tail, and language, and bugs, and the color changes. " </blockquote> In addition, the chameleon is a very funny character, around which you can create a lot of funny situations.  And he can "shoot" the language - we can also create as many virtual machines for testing.  We, like the chameleon, can change their ‚Äúcolors‚Äù by launching IE8 on Windows or Firefox on Linux.  Very, very nice parallels. <br><br>  This morning, on the train to the office, I realized that the logo, the name and the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7">motto</a> <i>(if you were not in the pioneering organization and were born under capitalism, would the word ‚Äúslogan‚Äù be closer to you)</i> should you come together?  Well, or at least not contradict. <br><br>  What is the essence of our system?  We are Selenium cloud.  The cloud is associated with a certain space, which can change (elastic), spread out or gather (stretchable).  Having poshamaniv or sacrificing the gods, you can cause rain (can be used on demand).  Amazon calls its service Elastic Computing Cloud, Oleg's company is called Parascale <sup>**</sup> - tobto uses the words 'scale' or 'scalable'.  I also used the word 'valium' (valium), thinking about connecting it with the word 'selenium' and the slogan 'Selenium testing and no stress' ('Stress free Selenium testing') or something like that.  Having passed several stations (it was on the train), I realized that, despite the fact that our service really facilitates testing with Selenium, the slogan in this case will not say anything about the main advantage of the service - the ability to use as many resources as necessary (scalability Selenium way). <br><br>  After the insight that had descended on me, I wrote down the words for myself: <br>  Chameleon <br>  Selenium <br>  Elastic <br>  Valium <br>  Cloud <br><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/47b/058/b9d/47b058b9d80971800dcf3db6bbaa6ad4.jpg" width="272" height="215"><br>  and began to combine them with: <br><br>  --Valium &amp; Selenium <br>  Valenium (+) <br>  Selanium (+) <br>  Selium - of course not Valium (well, almost ...) <br><br>  --Scale &amp; Selenium <br>  Scalium <br>  Scanium <br><br>  --Cloud &amp; Selenium <br>  Closelin (-) <br>  Closeus (-) <br>  Seclonium (-) <br>  Closenium (-) <br>  Clodium <br><br>  --Elastic &amp; Selenium <br>  Seltic <br>  Elanium (+) <br>  Those who liked the plus.  Those that are not - with a minus. <br><br>  Variants of slogans: <br><br>  - stress free Selenium cloud <br>  - elastic Selenium cloud <br>  - Selenium on a cloud <br><br>  Slogans can be polished further.  I see the slogan in large letters on the system‚Äôs home page next to the name and logo. <br><br>  <strong>Wed</strong>  <strong>Jan.</strong>  <strong>27, 2010 2:04 am - Sasha</strong> <blockquote>  Dima: ‚ÄúChameleon is also a cool character.  And you tail, and language, and bugs, and the color changes. " </blockquote>  I support.  Well, congratulations, we seem to have decided on a character. <blockquote>  Igor: <br>  "--Valim + Selenium <br>  Valenium <br>  Selanium <br>  Selium is certainly not Valium (well, almost ...) " </blockquote>  What is Celanium, that I have Elanium associated with medicines, for example, Relanium :) Generally, Celanium sounds better.  Can I give a couple more options?  Not?  Well, I still throw in - Secleon (Selenium cloud chameleon), Scasecl (Scalable selenium cloud). <br><br>  <strong>Wed</strong>  <strong>Jan.</strong>  <strong>27, 2010 11:16 am - Igor</strong> <br><blockquote>  Sasha: ‚ÄúWhat is Selanium, that I have Elanium associated with medicines?‚Äù </blockquote>  I agree, brought a bit. <br><blockquote>  Sasha: ‚ÄúWell, I'll throw it all the same - Secleon (Selenium cloud chameleon), Scasecl (Scalable selenium cloud)‚Äù </blockquote>  Your options take into account everything, but difficult to pronounce.  Perhaps it makes sense to refuse altogether from trying to abreviate everything in the title, otherwise we will receive <a href="http://www.vsegei.ru/">VSEGEI</a> , <a href="http://www.ass-concerts.de/">ASS Concerts</a> , and simply call for example Debugz.  Sounds like debug bugs and destroy bugs, and the definition of what it really is - Selenium cloud - will remain in the slogan. <br><br>  <strong>Wed</strong>  <strong>Jan.</strong>  <strong>27, 2010 9:22 pm - Oleg</strong> <br>  <i>(sent slogans to consult)</i> <br><br>  ‚ÄúSelenium in the cloud‚Äù sounds like a good description. <br>  "Stress-free selenium service in the cloud" is a good slogan <br><br>  <strong>Su</strong>  <strong>Jan.</strong>  <strong>31, 2010 11:33 am - Igor</strong> <br>  Debugz - domain is busy. <br><br>  I read it here: <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bazooka">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bazooka</a> - the domain is naturally busy, I am writing - can anyone light up on this topic <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chameleon">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chameleon</a> - ‚Äúand rapidly extrudable tongues‚Äù was thought to be 'eXtrudius' (the word itself is well thought out) or 'Extrudius'. <br><br>  Since Selenium on demand - can it be ' <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/demandus">Demandus</a> ' or 'Demandium' or 'Demanium' using the suffix Selen-ium? <br><br>  <strong>Su</strong>  <strong>Jan.</strong>  <strong>31, 2010 11:35 am - Igor</strong> <br><br>  Go to <a href="http://dictionaries.travlang.com/EnglishEsperanto/dict.cgi%3Fquery%3DChameleon%26amp%3Bmax%3D50">Esperanto</a> . <br><br>  <strong>Mon</strong>  <strong>Feb</strong>  <strong>01, 2010 10:29 pm - Igor</strong> <br><br>  From Esperanto: <br>  eskali or eSkali - translated as scale.  It is well pronounced in Russian - almost like ‚ÄúShot?‚Äù From the White Sun of the Desert, I don‚Äôt say that it can be written like eBay - a small letter and then a big one).  Registered trademark not found. <br><br>  insekto or inSekto - translated as bug.  The word contains Se.  Registered trademark not found. <br><br>  Other Esperanto words: <br>  demand - debito <br>  kill - mortigi <br>  cloud - nebuligi, nubo <br><br>  Other non-Esperanto names are patented and domains are not available: <br>  Bugster <br>  Bugbuster <br>  Buzzuka <br>  Buginator <br>  Buggle <br><br>  On the wave of Harry Potter: <br><br>  bugdemort.com - available, but looks like Harry Potter <br>  debugtor.com is in the book dementors.  I like.  And you? <br>  debugius.com - in the continuation of the topic.  Free <br><br>  debugos.com - it seems to me that it is better than shiftos.com.  Domain is free. <br>  selentos.com <br><br>  <strong>W.</strong>  <strong>Feb</strong>  <strong>02, 2010 1:39 am - Sasha</strong> <br><br>  We discussed with Dima and came to the conclusion that the option 'eXtrudius' or 'Extrudius' sounds good. <blockquote>  Igor: "'Demandus' or 'Demandium' or 'Demanium'" </blockquote>  But these options somehow in the direction of demonology are gone, which is scary :) <br><br>  <strong>W.</strong>  <strong>Feb</strong>  <strong>02, 2010 1:52 am - Sasha</strong> <br><br>  We've been creating creative here for quite a while.  Initial considerations - the trademark and domain name should be at least similar, so that one reminds one of the other, ideally the same.  Of course, this is not a necessary condition, but highly desirable. <blockquote>  Igor: <br>  "Debugtor.com <br>  debugius.com <br>  debugos.com ¬ª </blockquote>  The last two options seem to be nothing (debugius.com, debugos.com), like the previously discussed option 'eXtrudius' or 'Extrudius'.  But none of them is the undisputed leader, in each there is something completely uncomfortable.  In order to facilitate our fate, we have prepared the options, all domains are free: <br><br>  clinnium.com (1) <br>  bugspell.com (3) <br>  bugzcore.com (1) <br>  buzzless.com (1) <br>  deepium.com, deelium.com (3) <br>  deesbug.com (2) <br>  deesc.com (2) <br>  fireum.com (2) <br>  s-clo.com (1) <br>  sellenia.com (1) <br>  selenager.com (1) <br>  seekabug.com (1) <br><br>  The number of votes given for each option is indicated in brackets, it is easy to see the favorites :) Now, based on the received list (+3 options above), we will hold the final vote by selecting 3 candidates and by coincidence determine the winner. <br><br>  <strong>W.</strong>  <strong>Feb</strong>  <strong>02, 2010 9:53 am - Oleg</strong> <br><br>  With the exception of "selentos" and "escali", everything else does not fit, from my point of view. <br>  You are very focused on the -os and -us endings.  They are not super attractive. <br><br>  Think about the fact that many popular web startups have strange names that are not related to what they do.  If you want a name associated with what you do - selenium on demand testing.  selenium - takes its roots from the Greek 'selene' - the moon.  How does the moonwalk start?  Busy? <blockquote>  Igor: "moonwalk.com is busy." </blockquote>  <strong>W.</strong>  <strong>Feb</strong>  <strong>02, 2010 12:50 pm - Igor</strong> <br><br>  Moon Theme - Mooongle.com <br>  We can draw the chameleon behind the name by making two letters 'o' with his eyes.  Used three 'o' because moongle.com is busy. <br>  In Latin, the moon - Lynaris and Lynaris.com is free, but I prefer Mooongle.  It sounds better and almost like ‚Äúyou know who‚Äù. <br><br>  <strong>W.</strong>  <strong>Feb</strong>  <strong>02, 2010 2:31 pm - Igor</strong> <br><br>  Go to the <a href="http://www.lowchensaustralia.com/names/abornames.htm">names of Aboriginal</a> Australia <br><br>  <strong>W.</strong>  <strong>Feb</strong>  <strong>02, 2010 8:00 pm - Dima</strong> <blockquote>  Oleg: ‚Äúpopular web startups have strange names that have nothing to do with what they do‚Äù </blockquote>  We discussed the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãusing some kind of Russian sounding word, for example, the cloud. <br><blockquote>  Igor: ‚ÄúWe proceed to the names of Australian Aborigines‚Äù </blockquote>  Many beautiful words :) Same arana - moon. <br>  For that matter, I have long liked the words aranda and armidale.  Toowoomba also sounds mysterious. <br><blockquote>  Igor: ‚ÄúI like Mooongle more.‚Äù </blockquote>  The only thing I don‚Äôt like in Mooongle is the association with Google.  Or is it the other way around? <br><br>  <strong>W.</strong>  <strong>Feb</strong>  <strong>02, 2010 8:46 pm - Igor</strong> <br><br>  Another brainstorming in the train to work. <br>  Domains and mottos to them: <br>  nerrvana.com - we are looking for bugs with pleasure <br>  erranium.com - search for bugs without stress in the virtual cloud Selenium <br>  erronium.com - similarly <br>  moonshu.com - moon and shoot - just a good name, a bit meaningful <br>  nirvanium.com - immerse yourself in nirvana and test with Selenium.  I like that mach :) <br><del>  moonerr.com </del>  - find errors in your web application using with Selenium (the son said that this name sounds like - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mooning">mooning</a> , but we don‚Äôt need us at all) :) <br><br>  I like 'moonshu'. <br><blockquote>  Dima: ‚ÄúThe only thing I don‚Äôt like about Mooongle is the association with Google.  Or is it the other way around? ‚Äù </blockquote>  I agree.  Trying to be like Google is NOT good. <br><br>  All domains are free.  I suggest now to always check the options for the availability of the domain and indicate this fact. <br>  Most of the titles (the link I gave above) are unfortunately busy. <br><br>  <strong>W.</strong>  <strong>Feb</strong>  <strong>02, 2010 8:59 pm - Dima</strong> <br><blockquote>  Igor: "I like 'moonshu'." </blockquote>  I think a little Asian name, nerrvana more like it. <br><blockquote>  Igor: ‚Äúfinding errors in a pleasant way‚Äù </blockquote>  Good slogan) <br><br>  <strong>W.</strong>  <strong>Feb</strong>  <strong>02, 2010 10:04 pm - Sasha</strong> <br><blockquote>  Dima: ‚ÄúThe only thing I don‚Äôt like about Mooongle is associations with Google.  Or is it the other way around? ‚Äù </blockquote>  In principle, any associations are good, as long as the name is easily remembered.  The only bad thing is that there is a combination of ‚Äúngl‚Äù pronounced in Russian.  And so a good option. <br><br>  <strong>W.</strong>  <strong>Feb</strong>  <strong>02, 2010 10:13 pm - Sasha</strong> <br><blockquote>  Igor: <br>  "Nerrvana.com - we are looking for bugs with pleasure <br>  nirvanium.com - immerse yourself in nirvana and test with Selenium.  I like that mach :) " </blockquote>  These 2 options for me are better than others.  And if you choose from them, then I would take the second - I do not like double letters, people will make mistakes and come to another domain.  If we had the same theme as <a href="http://nervana.com/">nervana.com</a> , it would be a clever move.  By the way, they protupil, it was necessary to redeem such a domain. <br><br>  <strong>Wed</strong>  <strong>Feb</strong>  <strong>03, 2010 10:39 am - Oleg</strong> <br><blockquote>  Igor: <br>  "Nerrvana.com <br>  erranium.com <br>  erronium.com <br>  moonshu.com <br>  nirvanium.com ¬ª </blockquote>  To be honest, your -um and -us endings are not to my liking.  I prefer, after you send a link to Aboriginal names, to use one of them. <br>  nirvanium - sounds good, but very close to <a href="http://www.nirvanix.com/">Nirvanix</a> .  It can confuse both them and your customers, which may be the cause of a lawsuit from Nirvanix.
