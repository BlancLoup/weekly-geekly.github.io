All and more.  I do not know the answer to this question myself, and I continue to buy some of the publications ... well, or pick up magazines in the offices of companies where all these papers are brought, and where nobody reads them anyway.  I admit honestly - he began to read much less, sometimes even just leafing through.  It seems to be all right - relevant topics, visual infographics, interesting devices, neat, trimmed photos and sometimes funny headlines ... even disochek will write, if not two.  But ... rarely happiness is complete - then hygienic advertising will be made for a whole page spread, then a big picture full-page to ‚Äúspend some space‚Äù.  You read about the device you are familiar with and understand how empty or embellished the text is, but still ‚Äúin a magazine format‚Äù. <br><br>  But relatively recently there was a magazine like <b>C'T</b> .  He suddenly appeared in Russia (in my opinion, originally from Germany) and after only 7 numbers just as suddenly ceased to exist.  But, to admit, it was those 7 magazines which I read almost from cover to cover. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Imagine - 200 pages (which is quite a lot by the standards of current magazines) that DO NOT stink with typographical ink.  Inside - the almost complete lack of advertising (apparently, this undermined the foundation of the publication), but at the same time - the most interesting content.  Right here is the text-text-text (but not for hamsters), decorated with appropriate pictures (which do not occupy the whole page, as it is now fashionable to do).  Interesting topics of articles, interesting syllable, visual tables.  Professional reviews, programming, technologies, announcements of games, books, websites - it seems that the publisher could not decide on what to write about, that's why they wrote about everything.  Maybe this was a bribe - you flip through and rightly rejoice the eye.  And it's a pity that only 7 rooms ... very sorry. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/213/af7/db6/213af7db6067e85654d65474d43041c5.jpg" alt="image">

      Just the other day I decided to rake up my mail - out of almost 4,000 letters, about a thousand survived.  Among the letters I found a correspondence with the notorious editor-in-chief of the magazine ‚Äî I decided to write to him, they say, is there a finish, or is there still hope?  The answer was twofold - on the one hand, it seems to be like everyone else ... but on the other hand, "and maybe something else will turn out." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8ab/c08/ee0/8abc08ee088ccb13e54ff799d8486f32.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In short, I begged in electronic form this issue, which was not available anywhere else - exclusive) Actually, I want to share them, since the authors gave the go-ahead.  Despite the already irrelevant topics, the magazine will certainly be of interest to those who shared with me the opinion of the magnificence of the publication.  And for those who have not even heard of such a journal (and no one heard of him I know about it), I suggest that you read at least to see WHAT magazines may be.  At least for comparison with what they sell now) <br><br><img src="http://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4dc/cb6/863/4dccb686372ab2ac2be77bce6cdd980c.png" alt="image">  C'T # 8 |  19MB |  <a href="http://narod.ru/disk/22796748000/CT08_2008_SCR.pdf.html">Download</a> <br><br>  In general, anyone interested, download - the original PDF-ka just 20Mb.  Well, at least after a quick glance, I would like to know your opinion in kamentah - suddenly the authors (and they read Habr) will gather forces, and they will try again.  At least, I really want this - for such a journal, at least it is not a pity to give away money (and it cost about 100 rubles, if memory serves me).  In any case, I have already wound myself something for my reviews;) <br><br>  <b>Successes!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/99241/">https://habr.com/ru/post/99241/</a></p>
