I had an alarm clock.  I kicked my leg, suddenly waking up, and she came into close contact with the new laptop, innocently lying at the foot of the hotel bed.  He landed on a chair leg - the sound of the blow was loud.  An obvious dent appeared on the aluminum next to the Apple logo.  I opened it and saw a huge blob of broken pixels. <br><br>  I had a few options.  $ 600 for replacing the screen in the Apple store.  $ 500 from an independent repairman.  I fumbled with eBay and found out that the new screen can be bought for $ 50, if only I didn‚Äôt mind knowing what the MacBook Pro looks like from the inside.  I clicked "buy."  And then I saw the cogs.

      *** <br><br>  If you have ever tried to open iDevice - iPad, iPhone, iMac, anything - done in the last four years, you have met with the Eagle tiny five-pointed " <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentalobe_screw">Do not enter</a> " signs.  This is a clear statement that your phone, computer, tablet, is not really yours, and you can‚Äôt pick it up.  This is a public statement that you are not qualified to repair your own things. <br><br>  If you are reading this from an iPhone, or it is near you - look at the charging port, and next you will see these two tiny heads of five-petal screws [pentalobe] that are not found in the wild. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/43b/9ab/460/43b9ab460573488dbaec87993e03e306.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5c0/c5d/971/5c0c5d971f70cf31f8b63ff32d0e3f86.png"><br><br>  There is a solution for a five-petal screw - a <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Store/Tools/P2-Pentalobe-Screwdriver-iPhone/IF145-096">screwdriver from iFixit</a> , a <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Store/Tools/P2-Pentalobe-Screwdriver-iPhone/IF145-096">California-based startup</a> that is at the same time opposed to Apple and does everything so that, despite the constant complication of electronics, amateurs can still learn how to repair it (and other companies started to make screwdrivers).  [ <i>not to mention <a href="http://ru.aliexpress.com/popular/pentalobe-screwdriver-iphone-5.html">aliexpress</a> - approx.</i>  ] <br><br>  I recently spent several days with iFixit director Kyle Wines and repair technicians at the electronics reuse <a href="http://www.ereuseconference.com/">conference</a> in New Orleans.  I wanted to find out exactly how manufacturing companies infringe our rights to open, mess and repair their devices that we own. <br><br>  Manufacturers tried to attract the ‚ÄúCopyright Act in the digital age‚Äù ( <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/why-dmca-rulemaking-is-an-unsustainable-garbage-train">DMCA</a> ) to prove that the software that makes electronics electronics belongs to them, which means picking this software would be a copyright violation.  Apple quietly finished accepting applications from new applicants to become an "authorized service center" in 2010.  There is a withdrawal of lots of "fake" parts coming from China, which in fact can be quite legal.  There are development programs for leasing devices from Apple, so that you can never truly own a phone. <br><br>  ‚ÄúUsually, if a noggin falls off a hammer I bought, I have the right to repair it.  And after that, I can use it again, ‚Äùsaid Charles Duane, <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/putting-your-waterlogged-phone-in-rice-is-dumb-and-doesnt-work">director of the</a> Public Knowledge patent reform <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/putting-your-waterlogged-phone-in-rice-is-dumb-and-doesnt-work">project</a> .  ‚ÄúAnd in the case of new electronics, its manufacturers want only them to repair it, since they have more profits from this.  They have already found many ways to achieve this.  Intellectual property laws, contracts, user agreements are a lot of ways to make it so that you can't do what you want with your things. ‚Äù <br><br>  Therefore, Apple has many ways to not let you into their devices.  But why not start with a screw.  <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/01/21/us-apple-screws-idUSTRE70K0BO20110121">On January 20, 2011, Reuters</a> reported that Apple employees were told not to inform the phone owners about the substitution.  The replacement was to ensure that no one except Apple would get into the device. <br><br>  The iPhone 4 had normal Philips head screws.  But somewhere in 2010, the company <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/01/21/us-apple-screws-idUSTRE70K0BO20110121">gave the installation for its "geniuses" in the Apple Store</a> to replace these screws with five-petals in the smartphones coming in for repair.  In theory, this was supposed to restrict access to devices for everyone except Apple. <br><br>  Weins expected such a development of events, it was he who told Reuters about what was happening, and then, the day after the article appeared, iFixit released an ‚Äú <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/ifixit-offers-pentalobe-screwdriver-iphone-4-258043">iPhone release kit</a> ‚Äù consisting of a screwdriver for a five-petal screw and two screws with conventional heads.  During his trip to Japan, Wines discovered that the Japanese iPhone 4 came with five-petal screws.  One of the local repairmen using a microscope and a file set off a flat screwdriver to the five-petaled state, and managed to open the iPhone. <br><br>  "It was the first screwdriver in the world, not owned by Apple, able to unscrew the five-petal screw," says Wines.  "Apple literally tightened the screws in its relations with its users, and since we knew everything in advance, we were able to sell the screwdriver as soon as it entered the United States." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9c9/826/5dd/9c98265ddbc8dda56b187c7005cc6600.png"><br>  <i>Kyle Wines</i> <br><br>  I learned about iFixit shortly after this screwdriver.  After searching Google, I got to the site of the California company San Luis Obispo.  Having bought a five-petal screwdriver, I spent a few minutes exploring the site, and it opened my eyes to the existence of a large and thriving DIY repairmen community. <br><br>  Want to know how to fix the " <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Xbox%2B360%2BRed%2BRing%2Bof%2BDeath%2BFix%2BKit/3550">red ring of death</a> " that occurs on the Xbox 360?  On iFixit there are step-by-step instructions for hacking the device, and in the same place you can buy spare parts and tools.  Want to <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Device/Canon_Camera">disassemble a DSLR camera lens</a> ?  <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Device/iPhone_6">Replace the screen on the iPhone</a> (or any other phone)?  Install more memory in the computer?  Fix an alarm clock?  IFixit has it all.  Want to know how the iron works?  What about a washing machine, or Speak &amp; Spell toys?  No problem.  Want to learn how to sew a button on your shirt?  You and this will be taught. <br><br>  Although I constantly mention Apple, this company is not alone in trying to prohibit or complicate the repair of broken things.  Most manufacturers are clamping repair instructions, Apple is mentioned only because the market for repairing iPhones is larger than any android phone. <br><br>  John Deere argued with the copyright department that if we allow farmers and mechanics to repair their tractors, this will lead to the fact that "pirates, third-party developers and less innovative competitors will have the opportunity to profit by creative achievements, unique embodiments and the genius of software machines."  Lexmark has been suing a company for a long time with a company that <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/12/supreme-court-hears-aftermath-of-long-dead-dmca-printer-cartridge-case/">re-engineered their printers</a> to develop and sell cartridges.  It‚Äôs almost impossible for consumers to open the HTC One - and so on and so forth. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/764/c8f/d88/764c8fd88cf0094aa5101b9eb065b0a4.png"><br><br>  The electronics reuse conference was filled with people rejecting manufacturers ‚Äôdesire to control the devices in their hands.  There are, of course, industry secrets and repair strategies that companies do not share - basically, these people are trying to figure out how to convince consumers that repairing electronics is often better than replacing it. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe are not competing with each other,‚Äù says Vains to a hundred repairmen (there are different people at the presentation, but mostly white-skinned middle-aged men).  "We compete with the trash." <br><br>  "When you first open an electronic device, it turns from a magic black box into a bunch of things connected together." <br><br>  When iFixit uncovered microscopes and soldering irons to demonstrate the repair and replacement of transistors and capacitors a hundred times smaller than a dime on the iPad, it became obvious that these professionals are much more serious about the art of repair than any manufacturer. <br><br>  ‚ÄúPeople here are doing repairs that Apple doesn‚Äôt dream of,‚Äù Chris Collins, a Texas repairman, told me.  Collins repairs Apple devices, gaming consoles, old stereos, and turntables, and even contracted to repair surveillance cameras in city sewers.  "The world's top repair professionals do not work for Apple." <br><br>  Jessa Jones, in the past - a microbiologist, is now engaged in repairing the iPad.  In a professional environment, she <a href="http://mendonipadrehab.com/about">is considered one of the best specialists in the world</a> .  In addition to bringing up four children and working as a housewife, she spends days getting valuable data from an imbued iPad, which no one would take, or repairing short circuits that caused the backlight of tablet screens to burn out.  She does her job so well that she doesn‚Äôt take money for a failed repair. <br><br>  ‚ÄúEven in our community of repairmen, it is believed that the art of repairing boards died when things moved to a microscopic level,‚Äù says Jones, who founded <a href="http://mendonipadrehab.com/practical-board-repair-school">a board repair school</a> .  "This is not true.  The more people engaged in high-level repair, the more devices we save, the more data we will recover, the more we will be able to promote our idea to the masses. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/346/f03/1ea/346f031ea6cf85aadfd4074fc2cae924.png"><br><br>  Later, for a beer, Vines falls into a nostalgic mood and recalls the times when washing machines worked for fifty years, and not five.  He notes that increasing the screen of smartphones leads to an increase in the number of broken smartphones - ‚ÄúHave you ever seen a Galaxy Note with a whole screen?‚Äù, He asks - and says angry ranks, regretting that his company should exist at all. <br><br>  He says that the fact that Apple and other manufacturers do not sell parts to consumers and do not make repair instructions for them leads to disastrous consequences for the environment.  The transition to unique screws, the threat of falling under the rink of copyright lawyers, enmity with independent repair shops ‚Äî all this shows that the culture that opposes repair has not grown out of naivety or negligence ‚Äî it is cultivated with malicious intent. <br><br>  As Vines says, leaving a broken phone in a desk drawer or throwing it in the trash is two of the worst things you can do with electronics.  And recycling will not be much better. <br><br>  "For electronics, recycling should be the last refuge," writes Weins in his article, " <a href="http://ifixit.org/blog/4546/happy-earth-day-dont-recycle/">Happy Earth, and do not need to recycle anything</a> ." <br><br>  In an ideal world, your thing would be repaired, and you would continue to use it.  And you could also fix it and sell it, or just make sure it was repaired and used ‚Äî that would be just as good.  ‚ÄúMining and production ‚Äî in that order ‚Äî is the worst thing we do with the world,‚Äù he told me. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a3b/7ff/07f/a3b7ff07f0c24e2ba2a1c392dcfc181f.png"><br>  <i>Agbogbloshi district of the capital of Ghana, Accra</i> <br><br>  When creating a smartphone uses about 50 elements of the periodic table, many of which are present in very small quantities.  And most of them are not available for recycling. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe plastic of your iPhone will be turned into low-quality plastic, and then into a park bench.  ‚ÄúIt's a pity, because this is high-quality plastic, it can cost up to $ 30 per pound,‚Äù he says.  After processing, it will cost ten cents per pound, since it cannot be processed separately from the cheap. ‚Äù <br><br>  If we don‚Äôt want to use electronics during its entire possible life cycle, we need to figure out how to keep it in working condition and pass it on to those who can use it.  ‚ÄúEvery person should have a cell phone, but we have to figure out how to achieve this through reasonable methods,‚Äù he says. <br><br>  Much of Vain's environmentalism was born on several trips to developing countries.  He‚Äôs inflamed most of all when he talks about people ‚Äî about the man repairing the water pumps he met in Kenya, Cairo‚Äôs best mechanics, or people from Delhi, revealing old CRT TVs and monitors to make new ones (this is very dangerous because each CRT monitor has up to 5 kilograms of lead). <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe all heard about e-waste, and I decided to see everything with my own eyes,‚Äù he says.  He therefore visited the Agbogloshi district in Accra, the capital of Ghana, which is commonly referred to as the ‚Äú <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/inside-the-worlds-biggest-e-waste-dump">world's largest e-dump</a> ‚Äù, and many other cities in developing countries.  (He even shot a documentary on this topic, which has not yet been published yet).  Agbogbloshi is really a disaster for the environment, but it's not that simple. <br><br>  ‚ÄúEverybody says that we throw garbage into Africa.  But in reality, this is not the case, says Vines.  ‚ÄúIn fact, they buy electronics from us because of the need, and when it breaks down, they throw it away because they do not have waste processing and recycling facilities.‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3a0/467/982/3a04679827254da286e9799628f87f85.png"><br><br>  According to Wines, in Agbogloshsi and many other places there is no access to spare parts and repair instructions, as a result of which they do not have the opportunity not to throw out these things. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe problem is that there are complex products, and their manufacturers do not share with us information on their repair.  You make a million printers, they are used in millions of different ways, and at the end of their life they are thrown away or discarded from them in a million different ways.  This is a lever that we can use to teach people how to fix things.  We stumbled upon a solution to a huge problem.  That's why I do my job. ‚Äù <br><br>  *** <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/696/e80/d9e/696e80d9e74d7d96b013b024e8128844.png"><br><br>  Having ordered the LCD screen for the MacBook, I did not think about its origin.  Yes, I had no idea about it.  But it was not made by Apple.  Go to eBay or search for a component of a computer or smartphone.  You will find spare parts for cameras, headphone jacks, LCD screens and iPhone front panels (it's easier to replace the entire panel, including the camera, than a separate glass).  You will see a huge variation in prices for parts and their different names.  There will be "original" parts, OEM, "certified", "used" and "extracted from used devices." <br><br>  Even people who make their living by repairing it is not clear what these words mean. <br><br>  Everything is so conceived.  Americans <a href="http://www.squaretrade.com/press/new-study-shows-damaged-iphones-cost-americans-10.7billion-4.8b-in-the-last-two-years-alone">spent more than $ 23.5 billion</a> to repair and replace broken smartphones from 2007 to 2014.  In 2013, the analyst said that Apple <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2014/07/31/apple-replacing-displays-in-stores/">is going to save a billion dollars</a> by repairing the iPhone instead of replacing them - this gives an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe size of the repair market for the most popular phone in the world.  Apple wants to bite off a bigger piece of the market.  Because she controls iron, she wants to control the parts market as well. <br><br>  There is nothing illegal in the sale and production of LCD screens for the iPhone, but it is illegal to produce the back panel with the Apple logo.  Apple has registered trademarks for different things - for example, the rectangle on the Home button, and it also places logos even on some internal cables. <br><br>  So what is a "fake" part?  Who knows! <br><br>  ‚ÄúApple and Samsung do not like the gray market, and this is the gray market,‚Äù Scott Head from iFixit explained at the conference.  ‚ÄúThere is a difference between the way customs officials and manufacturers perceive authenticity.‚Äù <br><br>  Most repairmen told me that they are trying to order legal parts from China.  But did these <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/how-to-perform-amateur-surgery-on-a-phone">500 Sony Xperia panels come from the</a> original production?  Fell from the truck on the way?  Were made without the permission of Sony?  All this matters - and many problems would be solved if only the manufacturers themselves would sell parts to consumers and repairmen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/807/cf3/628/807cf3628268082b88ecfbdee95408d1.png"><br><br>  Such questions lead us to situations where customs officers after a <a href="http://www.local10.com/news/federal-agents-raid-smartphone-repair-shops/19898110">raid at 25 Miami repair shops</a> confiscate "fake" parts for iPhones for $ 300,000.  Local news in 2013 reported: <br><br>  ‚ÄúAbella Abella claims that 20 customs agents and two people from Apple came to their Bird Road shop.  ‚ÄúWe bought parts from a Californian company.  And to this day they sell them, ‚Äú- says Abella.  ‚ÄúWhy did they come for me?‚Äù <br><br>  Abella did not want to give me an interview, but said that the raid had devastating consequences.  "Since then, I have not been repairing iPhones, I generally left the business." <br><br>  Last year, customs officers confiscated parts and electronics for $ 162 million as a result of 6,612 raids under the Operation Chain Reaction program, in which 16 government agencies participated.  It is easy to find <a href="http://www.howardforums.com/showthread.php/1788191-iPhone-screens-seized-by-US-Customs-cell-Phone-repair-is-illegal!">posts on the forums</a> for the authorship of people whose business or lives were destroyed by this program. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe were terribly frightened, we removed all the parts from all the stores and brought them to my house,‚Äù said Ivan Mladenovich, manager of two TechBar repair shops in South Florida.  - We transported 2-3 parts to the workshop at a time.  I have the impression that the repair business of iPhones may one day simply disappear.  Apple can simply eliminate the entire industry if it wants to go against us. " <br><br>  *** <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5b9/a2d/271/5b9a2d271def932bc837e3531b4acb1c.png"><br><br>  The ability to repair your things disappears as the electronics become more difficult in the device, the ability to open it and it becomes easier to get rid of it.  Most people who advocate self-repair had some insight that inspired them to do this.  It happened to me because of the laptop. <br><br>  Vines listens carefully to how I cracked my MacBook Pro using his website, and since I saved on tools, I used a knife to remove the glass from the LCD.  I understood little of what I was doing, and at 4 am, after six hours of fussing, solving problems and trying not to lose the cogs barely visible to the eye, I was left with a set of pieces on the kitchen table and a headache from disappointment. <br><br>  Wines is familiar with this feeling.  iFixit appeared due to the difficult repair of a laptop, started by him in college.  As a student at the California Polytechnic, he saved enough money to buy a new iBook for $ 1,800.  Like me, Vines showed his clumsiness by breaking the laptop shortly after the purchase.  But, unlike me, he had no one to turn to for help. <br><br>  He looked for repair instructions, but found nothing.  And still dismantled it.  ‚ÄúIt was two o'clock in the morning, and I thought‚Äú I will leave the details, and in the morning I will assemble ‚Äù.  It was a bad idea.  The next day I could not figure out what was where.  I then collected it all back, and the computer worked, but not in the same way as before. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/28d/564/2fe/28d5642fe2e3b5cb51ce1fdc6095a5e5.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Weins continued his research and found that Apple filed lawsuits based on the DMCA against sites that dared to lay out official instructions for repairing the company's equipment. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúAnd I thought,‚Äú Wow, they use copyright to forbid people to repair things. ‚Äù I thought it was some kind of heresy. ‚Äù </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Weins and his partner, Luke Souls, decided to find all the iBook, PowerBook computers, write repair instructions for them and sell for $ 15. The matter did not go; they never sold their 50 instructions. Then they posted them on the site for free, wrote about them in a couple of blogs dedicated to Apple, and they suddenly turned into a source of information of this kind.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúAll this is an attempt to circumvent copyright laws. According to the results of our study of developing countries, we decided that the world needed instructions for repairing anything and everything. There are two ways to do this - either get manufacturers to open their documents, or write new ones. We have not yet abandoned the first point, but are concentrating on the second. ‚Äù </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On the first question, iFixit became one of the most well-known companies campaigning for DMCA reform, and even snatched a small victory when the head of the Library of Congress allowed </font></font><a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/why-dmca-rulemaking-is-an-unsustainable-garbage-train"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">for a couple of exceptions to the law</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> protecting the ‚Äúright to repair‚Äù. iFixit purposefully and successfully attacked the John Deere Corporation - now farmers can poke around in tractors without fear of being condemned. Now the company is fighting for the adoption of state law, which</font></font><a href="http://newyork.digitalrighttorepair.org/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">will oblige manufacturers to sell parts for repair</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> and issue instructions. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Few small companies that tried to oppose their activities to the largest corporations in the world survived. Even less live well. But iFixit seems to have found its niche in the throwing of stones in the eplovo Goliath. First, a five-petal screwdriver appeared, and by the time the iPhone 4S came out, iFixit sent one of the engineers to Australia so that it could become one of the world's first buyers of new devices - and one of the first to disassemble them. The company operates at a profit, although Wines doesn‚Äôt cover exact numbers. The separated company Dozuki sells wiki technology to corporate clients around the world.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">With each release of the new iPhone, MacBook or iPad, iFixit has to develop new tools using artisanal techniques to open and repair them. A week after the release of Apple Watch, the company has already made special adhesive strips to assemble the watch after the repair. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7ba/651/fcf/7ba651fcfc437a3383eda9ce4e7121c3.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6a9/e7a/d49/6a9e7ad49e6ab80dd12af576e0f16794.png"><br> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúPizza Cutter‚Äù ( </font></font><a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Store/Tools/iMac-Opening-Tool/IF145-219-4"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">opener for iMac</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ) and </font></font><a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Store/Tools/iSclack/IF145-243-1"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">iSlack device opening tool</font></font></a></i> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ‚ÄúWe have such a thing like a pizza cutter, which is convenient to open the new iMac, so we entered the pizza cutting business,‚Äù says Weins. We also make suckers, which I really didn‚Äôt expect - they are necessary for opening iPhones. Apple and I have been butting for a long time. This company solves problems by ignoring people. ‚Äù</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After publishing the article, Apple responded to one of my three inquiries: ‚ÄúWe are not discussing the company's future plans and disclosing information about the profits received from the repair. All relevant information about authorized repair shops is available on locate.apple.com. ‚ÄùThe </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">cold war between Apple and iFixit has been warming up recently, Apple has </font></font><a href="http://ifixit.org/blog/7401/ifixit-app-pulled/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">removed the iFixit application from the App Store</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> for breach of contract, because Apple sent iFixit new Apple TV, and iFixit by his habit of taking it apart.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is also worth noting the interesting changes between the iPhone 5S and the iPhone 6. 5S is especially dangerous to repair - the wire from the Home button to the motherboard is very easy to tear off when you open the phone (it happened to me). And for security reasons, breaking this wire causes TouchID to fail on the device. Forever and ever. On the 6th iPhone, this wire was shifted differently so that it does not interfere, and it was no longer so easy to tear it.</font></font><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/lSA8uFwptJc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgAuN6G-BdmprTNAW6eDnXA6yZJAA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúApple makes more than a billion a year on repairing iPhones, so they can afford to instruct Jonathan Yves to make an iPhone more maintainable,‚Äù says Weins. ‚ÄúSuch changes require time and careful thought, and they are expensive - all in order to make the device more fixable.‚Äù </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After a flurry of criticism from Wines and the media, due to the fact that the MacBook Pro Retina uses too much glue to mount the battery, Apple switched to more convenient stripping strips that secure the battery to the iPad Pro. The change seems to be small, but it is not. Apple has </font></font><a href="http://fortune.com/2012/07/07/what-apple-lost-by-dropping-epeat-green-certification/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">lost its ‚Äúecological‚Äù status in EPEAT</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">, an organization under the wing of the environmental protection agency, because the MacBook Pro Retina with glued batteries could not be recycled. Leaving batteries in devices often leads to fire. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúThe guys from Apple armed themselves with a sledgehammer and a crowbar, and pulled out their battery,‚Äù says Weins. Apple got its certificate back and switched to adhesive strips. Thus, we have already won a great deal - using environmental concern as arguments. ‚Äù </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúI sat at meetings with their lobbyists,‚Äù he adds. ‚ÄúThey get paid for opposing anything that could limit their designers.‚Äù</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">iFixit recently announced that, instead of Apple, it will supply bulk parts of spare parts to repair shops, and has launched a certification program for workshops through online testing. But it is even more important that iFixit makes it clear to those brave ones that they dare to open their devices - they are not alone. Most repair instructions are written by site users. DIY on the forums constantly discuss hacks, modifications and other tricks to facilitate the repair of devices. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúWe want to teach everyone how to fix everything,‚Äù says Vines. ‚ÄúWithout the help of the community, we cannot do this.‚Äù</font></font><br><br>  *** <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8c6/e39/1d2/8c6e391d28f5f8fed6be82c6d924a7a0.png"><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">My MacBook is in the process of repairing. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I was carrying my MacBook until dawn. The screen clicked strangely when I opened and closed it, but all the small cables were stuck in place. I pressed the power button - and he earned. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For me, as for a person who had avoided manual labor all his life, be he rude or exact, this feeling was unexpected and unusual. I repaired something myself. To some small extent, I had the feeling that I was going against the system. But mostly I was just proud of myself.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúWhen you open an electronic device for the first time, it stops being a magic box, and you see that it‚Äôs just a bunch of parts put together,‚Äù says Weins. - Plumber is not necessarily better than me versed in plumbing, he just works faster and he is familiar. So with many other things. ‚Äù </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At home in California, he repairs garden sprinklers, chairs, toilets, and everything that breaks. Replaced the clutch on his pickup, tried to assemble the disassembled chainsaw, and got a scolding from the manufacturer of the folding knife when he tried to replace the spring in it. But most of all he is afraid of replacing the lightning on his jacket (‚ÄúA story for the whole day, and most likely with an unlucky end‚Äù). </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Bible </font><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Shop-Class-Soulcraft-Inquiry-Value/dp/0143117467"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Repairmen</font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - </font></font><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Shop-Class-Soulcraft-Inquiry-Value/dp/0143117467"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Shop Class as Soulcraft</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">[‚ÄúRepair Courses as a Discipline for the Soul‚Äù] by Matthew Crawford [2010]. The author writes about how he quit his well-paid job as an office analyst and started repairing motorcycles - and got more pleasure and intellectual incentives from this work. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúThe disappearance of tools from the curriculum is the first step towards comprehensive ignorance in the artifact world we inhabit,‚Äù writes Crawford. ‚ÄúThe engineering culture that has emerged in recent years, in which the object must hide its internal structure, leads to the fact that we do not know how to study the many things we use.‚Äù</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/63a/9ea/16e/63a9ea16e21b5a55790158ea94bacd7c.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Such thoughts arise from all who work in the company. When they moved to their current location in an office that previously belonged to car dealers, employees spent several weeks reworking it. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúWe specifically left the repair unfinished. On Saturdays we attached wooden boards we bought. The tool development team sits over there, in cargo containers. ‚ÄúThey took plasma cutters, cut out the doors there and put them on the sliding mechanisms,‚Äù said Scott Dingle, who has been with the company for four years. ‚ÄúIf we could build this building ourselves, we would do it - this is our mindset.‚Äù</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúThis is a self-made group, everyone likes to build something and modify it on their own,‚Äù says Jake Devincenzi, a former iFixit employee who now works at an electronics processing company. "If Kyle‚Äôs wishes were fulfilled, we would live together in complete harmony." </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And this is not a question of opposition from Apple or any other company. It‚Äôs not just a matter of fighting to preserve the environment. It‚Äôs nice to repair things. It‚Äôs not surprising that I once found the staff companies and other repairmen drinking beer and whiskey surrounded by microscopes late at night after the conference.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Spare parts for the iPhone and iPad were the table and the floor. Someone was showing the phone‚Äôs own back panel. Jessa Jones repaired the iPad's backlighting and told everyone what each component was for. Weins and colleagues discussed fiction, decided which pizza to order, and showed off their latest renovations. Beer was run several times. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At some point, Wines poured himself a warm whiskey. Then he grabbed the freezing cylinder (it is used to search for overheated chips on the boards), put it in his temples and sprayed it. The spray scattered everywhere, but the drink cooled.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then I realized that Vines, in fact, devotes a lot of time to the struggle for his company not to become needed. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I asked what would happen if Apple and other manufacturers decide to start teaching people how to fix devices and offer official parts. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúIFixit is a hack. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Manufacturers must do this. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I would love to do something else. ‚Äù </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But I still did not believe him.</font></font></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/395225/">https://habr.com/ru/post/395225/</a></p>
