At the moment, we are planning to mite 2.0, and I would like to take into account as many shortcomings as possible in order to improve the pastime for more guests. <br><br>  We tried our best.  We tried hard.  To my great regret, MIT v.1 I‚Äôm afraid I don‚Äôt even have a hard time ... But I‚Äôll not say that everything was very bad.  Perhaps the bad is always easier to notice, perhaps there were really bad moments, and in fact there were more successful ones.  Whatever one may say, but for us, the organizers of this event, MITTING v.1 gave incomparably much.  I mean the experience and understanding of the very device of such professional evenings.  This invaluable experience, although it has plunged many of us into shock - we frankly did not expect so many negative posts.  But this is also the result.  Thanks to everyone who spoke and "put" us on the case.  We will surely take into account all wishes and will make every effort to implement them at the following events. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      I want to list the problems that in my opinion took place: <br>  1. Registration.  Horror.  Over offensively, you had to stand in such a queue.  Even more offensive is that someone did not wait for their turn. <br>  2. Music ... That's hard to say about music.  the quality seemed acceptable to me.  Music is probably difficult to evaluate, taste and color ... <br>  3. Beer.  Unfortunately was driving.  I did not try, but I have no reason to disbelieve the participants.  I believe and grieve ... We will check the beer next time. <br>  4. The staff is really a scoop.  Unfriendly.  We will be more demanding on the choice of location. <br>  5. There was enough space for communication in my opinion, the only thing, apparently, the dance floor should be smaller, music is quieter, there are more tables. <br>  6. Carefully it is necessary to draw up a cultural program, if it is needed at all.  or do some contests and performances aimed at acquiring new professional dating <br>  7. You need to think of a way to meet before mITinga.  It is necessary to make a private messaging on the site so that professional connections are created before a personal meeting, which will only strengthen the started acquaintance. <br><br>  In conclusion, I will say that the mitigation v.2 be!  Be sure to take into account all the wishes, think over all the details in more detail.  We will all be grateful for the kind words and comments on the case. <br>  Thanks to everyone who came! <br><br>  Photo: <a href="http://m-it-ing.ru/photo_report.php">m-it-ing.ru/photo_report.php</a> <br><br>  <font color="#FFFFFF">32258531.faf361d27d2a339d35ca4be7bebe179a.1210668569.c5c55913fbe467a96a0cb8116feabbed</font> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/14167/">https://habr.com/ru/post/14167/</a></p>
