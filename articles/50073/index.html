  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why do I need virtualka?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I think that everyone has ever heard that there are virtual machines (hereinafter referred to as "VM"). <br>  Virtual machines allow you to deploy multiple systems based on a single computer or server. <br>  I want to tell about how you can use them and why they are needed. <br><br>  If it is not difficult for you, comment and feel free to ask questions. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To begin with, I met them quite a while ago.  I will not advertise a specific product, I can only say that I used one of the most common systems working on Windows;) <br>  I came to the use of VM due to the fact that on duty I had to support the illiterate users of the same Windy scattered throughout the city.  The problem was that users were on different systems.  A couple of times I even had to deal with 95 and NT =).  But it's not about that. <br>  We all understand that it is impossible to remember everything, and when they call you and ask for example: ‚Äúhow do I adjust the network settings for win ME‚Äù, you unwittingly try to remember what is there and how, and you begin to overwhelm the already scared user with questions. <br>  Why am I doing all this, and besides, I solved the problem for myself by creating virtuals with almost all popular AXs, and the questions disappeared by themselves, the necessary virtual machine was just opened, and I, together with the user, performed the actions necessary to solve his problem. <br>  The second acquaintance, or more precisely the second application of the VM, was found when a powerful HP server appeared in the office.  After some time, it became clear: What has already been delivered to the server does not use 1/5 of its capabilities, and besides what was already on it (Vin 2k3 with AD, Eksch on 40 computers, ftp, Iza), shove it into it it was impossible, because everything else was on the Nix, and at the same time on the terribly wretched iron of the 90s, as well as what was transferred to the serv initially.  I decided that I could try to correct the situation and make the serv work 100%. <br>  At first, I put the VM directly from under Vind and deployed 3 virtual machines on it (as an experiment) and transferred some of the nicknames (mostly databases, and all sorts of experiments) to them.  The next day, surprised employees came to me, asking what happened, that now everything is flying like that.  I was pleasantly surprised by the fact that, on average, even at peak moments, the server load did not exceed 40%, in connection with which, the next night was devoted to a full transfer to virtual machines.  As a result, 7 VMs were created, which loaded the server by 80-90%, sometimes up to 98% at the peak, and finally consumed all the memory.  Thus, several problems were solved at once. <br>  1. Station performance. <br>  2. Saving electricity <br>  3. Reducing the noise in the home administrator - server. <br>  4. The release of space (in total, 10 computers dispersed in departments =)) <br>  5. Ease of management.  (it turned out some kind of console)

      The downside is that such systems, in the event of a critical failure, must be fully duplicated, since if one machine is covered (actually our server), then everything falls =), but this did not happen to me. <br>  Well, the machine must be powerful enough (percents, memory, disks), because everything is distributed between virtuals. <br><img src="http://www.jet.msk.su/Sites/jet/Uploads/virt.3353401878224A68A3D4DE236A72FEC1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Here is a small illustration that reflects the meaning of virtualization, only in my case, A, B and C are weak machines loaded at 90-100% and ABC Powerful server. <br><br>  Another VM is used by me, for security, I almost forgot. <br>  The fact is that VMs can be completely isolated from the Mother OS, that is, you can not be afraid to experiment with viruses, the left software, you can also check your code on them, since the virtual machine is much easier to repair than its main machine, plus it is always may be at hand. <br>  To the admin, she can also help at home: you can safely experiment creating virtual networks, emulating services. <br><br>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/admion/" class="user_link">admion</a> <br>  There is another option of using VMs for training, for example, familiarization with nix systems, many people are afraid that during installation they may accidentally format a hard disk, and install something new on the VM is more secure for the system. <br>  It can also be used to test new systems (the same win7) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/50073/">https://habr.com/ru/post/50073/</a></p>
