  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Radio communication with robots improves closer to full moon</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the previous article of a series of articles about DJI copters ( <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/272834/">here</a> and <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/273572/">here</a> ), the community supported with a ‚Äúvoice‚Äù the topic for the next article - analysis of communication with the drone. <br><br>  Analyzing hundreds of logs, I accidentally discovered a pattern I had never seen before.  At first I thought that I was interpreting the results incorrectly, or there was an error in my samopisny software.  But after spending the night in debugging, I was convinced that everything was correct. <br><br>  After drinking tea and thinking a little, I realized that this phenomenon affects not only the copters, but also all the electronics and robotics where radio communication is used.  The main factor of this phenomenon is the <b>moon</b> !

Each flight on the copter takes an average of 15 minutes, i.e.  I had about 7500 minutes of flight time.  The greatest concentration of data falls on the past month (March), where I decided to focus on the study of the radio signal. <br><br>  Data on the moon turned out to be not so easy to find.  For some reason, the request to find the API for the phases of the moon did not give out ready web services (I give the idea for a startup), but I still found some interesting answers to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9318328/lunar-phase-api">StackOverflow</a> , <a href="https://github.com/tingletech/moon-phase">the GitHub repository</a> and a couple of specialized topics on astronomy forums. <br><br>  Lunar phases are a parameter that does not interest us in everyday life, for others it is a vital factor.  The ebb and flow of the oceans are attributed to the attraction of the moon.  At a certain time of day, the water level in the oceans rises and then decreases.  The ocean is breathing. <br>  This interesting phenomenon is best observed on the shore of the White Sea.  This sea goes deep into the land and is more like a funnel-shaped bay.  If in the open ocean the height of the tidal wave reaches 1 m, then along the shores of the White Sea, its height increases several times. <br>  The attraction of the moon has an impact on human health.  Sometimes at this time there are mood swings in people, fatigue, irritability, insomnia. <br><br>  Combining all this together and adding a bit of my code I was able to calculate the lunar phases to the nearest second. <br><br>  For several hours I received all the data I needed in excel format and was ready to make the discovery. <br><br><h1>  Calculation method </h1><br><br>  First, thanks to the course of matana at my university, that I gave the necessary knowledge to find the truth.  Unfortunately, the searches did not produce logical results. <br><br>  Secondly, thanks to the developers of the Microsoft Office suite for embedding the possibility of some ‚Äúsmart‚Äù automatic analysis in Excel. <br><br>  Trusting the office, I saw the following picture: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b98/88a/9d5/b9888a9d56d34846b8efa4e7ebb80022.png" alt="image"><br><br>  At first glance, it seems that the moon does not affect anything, but in fact, it remains so unpredictable factor that we simply obey it. <br><br>  As you can see, the moon behaves discretely at the beginning of the month.  This is explained by the fact that at the beginning of the lunar month there were not enough flights in the database.  Perhaps the pilots on a subconscious level do not fly at this time?  This behavior is similar to what can be observed in the summer of migratory birds.  They on the "machine" understand where and when to fly (and when and where not to). <br><br><h1>  Recommendations </h1><br><br>  I recommend to all radio amateurs, modellers and robotics to refrain from using radio communications at the beginning of the lunar month. <br>  It may be worthwhile to consider the option of controlling the drone / robot via cable in order to reduce the risk of the electronics falling and getting out of control. <br>  Toward the end of the lunar cycle, you can get the consoles from the shelves. <br><br><h1>  findings </h1><br><br>  Although the nature of this phenomenon is still incomprehensible to me, I will continue to research.  Perhaps in a year of fruitful work (ie, by April 1, 2017) I will accumulate enough information to substantiate this phenomenon completely. <br><br>  In the meantime, I will return to the regular analysis of logs ... <br><br>  To be continued. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/392427/">https://habr.com/ru/post/392427/</a></p>
