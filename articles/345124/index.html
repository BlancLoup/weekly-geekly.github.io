And this is quite logical. <br><br>  How to optimize your costs without losing quality in business processes is almost a rhetorical question, but in order to survive where the competition goes off scale, you still have to attend to this.  Well, learned to optimize, okay.  Further - more interesting ... New tasks appear, and under them investments in new equipment, software, and qualified specialists are needed.  It is expensive, and inefficient.

      There are also companies for which IT is a non-core thing, for example: a contact center or Wi-Fi for a museum or customers, whose profits greatly depend on seasonality.  This, for example, an online store during the New Year holidays.  Capital costs for such companies - a decent load.  They are especially important, as in a short time and without serious money to get IT resources.  There is such an option as managed services.  This is when you pay monthly and you forget about a part of hemorrhoids. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In general, a managed service is such a service, something like outsourcing, but not in its classical sense, when part of the functionality is transferred to the outside, but with a much broader and more flexible approach (including financially).  You get all the necessary resources and do not worry about administration and technical support.  In short, all turnkey. <br><br>  We started to provide such services, and now there are several dozen of them.  This, for example, a contact center, Digital Signage, Wi-Fi-analytics to "digitize" the behavior of visitors / buyers.  Some of them are in Tsisk. <br><br>  All customers who implement managed services have certain general conditions: <br><br><ol><li>  No equipment and add.  funds for its purchase and service.  In other words, there is no budget for investments, but there is an understanding of the payback of the service. </li><li>  There are no people who will be engaged in a new project (or in general the business lives without its IT team). </li><li>  I want to start quickly - here and now, immediately after signing the contract. </li></ol><br>  Managed services are relevant for companies whose business is now inextricably linked with IT (banks, retail, etc.), for them it is an opportunity to optimize costs and establish inefficient business processes.  But there are also such customers who do not have an advanced IT block, but the business requires the introduction of a new technological service. <br><br>  The same Tretyakov Gallery, of course, does not want to build its contact center (even for a very small number of operators).  And he does not want to outsource him entirely either.  Solution - remote workplaces of operators in our data center.  In the simplest case (without CRM integration), deployment takes several hours.  In the "stuffing" there is everything you need: outgoing telephone calls, SMS and mailing lists, recording, IVR, reporting on operators.  There are, of course, <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/croc/blog/251503/">such</a> technological engines with speech synthesis and recognition, voice identification, etc.).  But if you have dozens of operators, this KC will hit your pocket a lot, and you will not be able to launch it for ‚Äúa couple of clicks‚Äù.  But it is also necessary to accompany. <br><br>  What is the beauty of KC as a managed service? <br><br><ol><li>  All capital costs are transferred to operating costs, which can be flexibly controlled depending on the actual number of operators required. </li><li>  You can grow in jobs at least several times in minutes.  This is especially true during the holidays. </li><li>  We exclude our own administration (no need to grow the internal IT department) - all work on our experts. </li></ol><br>  <b>Financial performance:</b> when using a managed service, the Tretyakov Gallery in the calculation of TCO for 5 years (25 operators) will <a href="https://www.croc.ru/news/detail/76815/">save</a> 71% of funds for the creation and maintenance of a contact center. <br><br>  Here is an example from world practice: a communications system was installed at the <a href="https://www.swisscom.ch/en/business/enterprise/success-stories/government-and-administration/schaffhauser-polizei.html">police station</a> (235 users) in the city of Schaffhausen, for which the vendor stopped issuing updates.  It worked - and did not touch, but at some point it was necessary to expand.  As a result, the police saved a lot by using the Managed Service On Premises model.  The site was equipped with a new telephone system, including 6 lines for emergency calls.  The system operates 24/7, and Swisscom, which has established it, is fully responsible for its operation and maintenance. <br><br><h2>  Digital signage </h2><br>  Suppose you need to provide each of your service offices with digital screens to which content for customers will be broadcast ‚Äî up-to-date information (promotions, discounts, special offers).  Or, for example, roll out the navigation and the program of the event at a large conference.  Here we need monitors, PC, special software.  Plus, all this must be purchased, brought, "friends" among themselves.  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/croc/blog/167427/">Here</a> is more detailed how this process looks like. <br><br>  Digital Signage is used to inform visitors about promotions, events and events;  to display entertainment content in waiting areas (TV-broadcasting, weather forecast, exchange rates, current news, etc.);  to build interactive processes of interaction / purchase without the participation of a consultant;  create visitor profiles in conjunction with video analytics (gender, age) and display targeted ads;  organize an additional corporate communication channel with employees. <br><br>  <b>Financial performance on the example of retail:</b> retail I want to put all this in operating costs so that you do not need to buy licenses and hardware.  Deployment in one of our examples took 5 days.  Scaling for 5 days (although it depends on the volume).  Administer on us. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_2/ek/qu/_2ekquuhybzqmk1ip-0m3powo1g.png"><br><br><h2>  Wi-Fi analytics of customer behavior </h2><br>  You go to the store, the phone sends a technical package to search the network.  The Cisco router (now they support this feature most fully) catches it and looks at your MAC address, it counts you, and then it checks to see if you have been before and when in other stores of the network.  More precisely, it makes the other component of the system, the router is used only as a sensor.  Plus, if there are at least three cisc access points, then you can create your movement map around the store with an accuracy of 2 meters (on new models).  Details here: (https://habrahabr.ru/company/croc/blog/331894/) <br><br>  The result is something like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ij/z_/oh/ijz_oht9cijh08qsijyfyiwqqoa.png"><br><br>  Wi-Fi analytics helps to increase revenues through the correct layout of goods and the distribution of sales assistants in places of "attraction", helps to evaluate the conversion from advertising campaigns and marketing activities, track the flow of repeat visitors;  identify promising shopping areas with low sales. <br><br>  <b>Financial performance:</b> when using a managed service model solution based on TCO for 5 years, the company will save 30% of money on the creation and maintenance of Wi-Fi analytics of customer behavior.  With the existing Cisco infrastructure, a bit more. <br><br><h2>  Video conferencing as a service </h2><br>  The service is useful when you need to quickly raise the video conferencing system, or (and this also happens) someone from the IT specialists already had experience of supporting VCS in a large company and does not want to dive into this fascinating task again. <br><br>  By comparing the TCO (hardware solution vs managed service from CROC), the customer will save up to 58% of money for 5 years.  The solution comes with Cisco Meeting Server as the core of virtualization, that is compatible with any other vendor solutions. <br><br>  An example from world practice: the customer <a href="http://www.appliedglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/AGTCaseStudy-GTAStateGovernment.pdf">provided</a> VCS for state organizations.  The equipment is outdated and was not compatible with more modern counterparts.  There was little money and no internal resources for modernization.  APG provided the customer with the EncoreB2B video calling platform with the ability to connect up to 18 participants to the conference in 15 minutes.  At the same time, all conference management and technical support were on the vendor side.  AGT also provided VCS on user devices and launched a call quality monitoring service.  The efficiency of video conferencing on user devices, troubleshooting, and management is remotely provided by the vendor support service.  As a result, over two years, the number of connected user devices increased by 64.7%, the total use of the service increased by 45.3%, and each invested dollar gave a saving of $ 8. <br><br><h2>  Optimized channel </h2><br>  Good old story about how to <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/croc/blog/267883/">optimize communication channels</a> .  Without laying of new channels it is necessary to raise the utilization.  Most often, geographically distributed companies are needed (read: Far East, offshore drilling).  It starts in 1-4 weeks (you need to get to the point). <br><br>  <b>Financial indicators of the optimization project for 20 communication channels:</b> in terms of TCO comparison (hardware solution vs managed service), the customer will save 28% of money for 5 years.  Here, the savings are the smallest compared to other managed services, but still sufficient to think about it. <br><br>  An example from world practice: the company had to centralize IT services on a global scale.  In the new centralized systems there were failures with access and data processing.  The internal team did not have the resources to manage the new technology.  Teneo took over the management of WAN optimization in customer offices around the world.  Result: optimization 4.7 times (industry standard 2.5 times) and a <a href="https://www.teneo.net/uk/success-story/plan-international/">reduction</a> in traffic volume by 78.6%. <br><br><h2>  Still </h2><br>  We also do as a service: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Managed Business Communications (when you need to combine email, VoIP, instant messaging, audio, video conferencing), for 100 connections over 5 years - 58% savings. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Management of information security services (installation of new generation firewalls and intrusion detection systems, cameras, access control systems). <br><br>  An example from international practice: the <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/physical-security/los_alamos_public_schools_case_study.pdf">solution</a> - a video surveillance system of 95 Cisco cameras on 3 campuses allows the customer not to waste his IT staff time on system maintenance, security staff can monitor the situation from tablets (now only one security officer is enough for one campus) general awareness of students and staff about emergency situations is increasing. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Network administration (LAN, WAN, Wi-Fi). <br><br>  A global example: due to inefficient use of IT and problems with service providers, JLL turned to Teneo for a managed WAN optimization service.  As a <a href="https://www.teneo.net/uk/success-story/jll/">result</a> , the customer‚Äôs team had more time to work on innovative projects while constantly improving the quality of network service. <br><br>  That's about it.  I think using the tables above, you can calculate for yourself the cost of owning and owning iron and the cost of the same outsourcing with the provision of equipment.  Well, or just email me, if you count the laziness, mail - SVrublevskaya@croc.ru. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/345124/">https://habr.com/ru/post/345124/</a></p>
