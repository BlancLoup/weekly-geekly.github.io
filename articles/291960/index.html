  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Setting up an automatic series of letters in MailChimp on the example of an online store</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Megamind, hello!  We have compiled a universal script for mailings in MailChimp.  It will suit most novice sellers and those who have not really engaged in e-mail marketing.  Similar scenarios and principles can be applied to any of your projects.  For example, you can set up a series of letters for subscribers;  those who have registered for the trial;  for clients. <br><br>  The goal of all these letter manipulations is simple - to increase sales without any special expenses.  Now we will step by step describe what emails need to be sent and how to set it all up in Mailchimp using the example of an online store.  The principle of setting is this: once done, and then everything should work itself.  Already in the process of work we analyze, improve, rework, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/734/e6f/f9b/734e6ff9b2a346e4ab5c9851a1ddb04f.jpg">

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Some things without developers or in your current store will not work.  In this case, just remember that there is still something to strive for and, perhaps, it is time to update the platform.  If anything, <a href="http://digistr.ru/">let's us</a> :) <br><br><h4>  <strong>So, we have two scenarios for getting subscribers to the list and corresponding goals.</strong> </h4><br>  <strong>1. When you lured the subscriber by any bonus or useful information through a subscription on the site</strong> .  In this case, it‚Äôs not a fact that someone will buy something from you, but the chances of selling are already much greater than when a visitor just leaves.  Here our goal is to sell something. <br><br>  <strong>2. With a new order</strong> .  For simplicity, we will consider only the first customer order.  We need to make these people buy more, become more loyal and participate in the development of your store. <br><br>  These are two different scenarios, since the buyer could not be a subscriber prior to his purchase.  Came and bought, then we sign it to the newsletter.  And those who simply subscribe buy and then follow the second mailing scenario - for customers.  The third scenario is a general newsletter, which is useful to all. <br><br>  Consider all these scenarios in detail and configure them in MailChimp. <br><br><h2>  Work with new subscribers </h2><br><br>  Here is a sale in two steps: to benefit and inspire confidence, and then sell. <br><br>  Go to your email account.  If it is not there yet, register via our <a rel="nofollow" href="http://eepurl.com/5NqXf">affiliate link.</a> You will be credited with $ 30 bonuses to the mailing balance. <br><br>  In the "Automation" section, click the "Create Automation Workflow" button.  So we create an automatic series of letters that will be sent independently according to specified conditions.  If you have not had a mailing list in this service, you will be prompted to create a list of subscribers.  Create it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/33b/944/aeb/33b944aeb2f6797e68d52dd2ff5293c1.png" width="706" height="616"><br><br>  For ourselves, we remember that a list with this name is just subscribers, not clients yet.  There will be a separate list for customers, because the most important thing in e-mail marketing is the segmentation of the subscriber base and the corresponding letter segments. <br><br>  The name appears in the letters, so it is not necessary to write phrases like ‚Äúour customers‚Äù, ‚Äúsubscribers‚Äù, etc. into it.  You need to write the name of your project in different ways, when there are several lists. <br><br>  We continue to create a series of letters.  Specify the list in which we have subscribers and select the ‚ÄúWelcome Series‚Äù option. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/dfb/d45/054/dfbd450548ec9ba95561175ba04cfeba.png" width="807" height="708"><br><br>  Further we specify the name of this series of letters, we specify the sender.  If under the sender's mail you are asked to confirm the domain, click on the link, specify any real mail in this domain, you will receive an activation letter.  That is, mailings can be done only from your own mail in your own domain.  Otherwise, the spam will fly away. <br><br>  Parameters can be left standard. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/4ad/3be/b9d/4ad3beb9d9aeab8bd4419b3bd5099246.png" width="1022" height="634"><br><br>  In the next step, you can leave everything as standard, since we will do the same for all subscribers.  You can only remove the tick from the weekend, if these days orders are not accepted by phone.  If all orders go on any day or without the participation of calls, you can leave, although the opening letters will be less on weekends. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/40d/e77/802/40de7780224e1405e7d09b7259ec2d05.png" width="682" height="708"><br><br>  Click "Next", we will be offered to add 1-5 letters that need to be edited.  We choose 5 letters, we make a professional newsletter. <br><br>  Our first email is sent immediately.  In it, we send what the visitor promised for a subscription: a discount coupon, some valuable information or instructions on what to do next.  For the same purpose, in the setting of the list of subscribers there is the option ‚ÄúWelcome message‚Äù - this is the letter that is sent when subscribing to the newsletter.  We recommend using the immediate first letter of the series.  So you can see the statistics of discoveries and clicks on this letter.  Even those who subscribed to the newsletter for a coupon - only 50-70% opened it.  In general, statistics will grind illusions. <br><br>  Click "Design Email" and edit the text of the first letter: specify the subject, choose a template, write the text.  At the first stages, the simplest templates will fit, even plain text.  Main content.  Now we need to adjust everything, and then improve it, all at once, it will not work out perfectly.  With unnecessary meticulousness, mailings may not get to work - there is still a lot of work ahead. <br><br>  Next you need to create the remaining letters. <br><br><h3>  The strategy for creating letters for the first sale by subscribers </h3><br><br>  <strong>1. You need to estimate the average period for which your visitor buys something</strong> .  If there is no such information yet, then assume based on common sense.  For example, it is possible that the TV is chosen and bought within two weeks, and the cover for the phone is bought immediately. <br><br>  Of course, the TV can start watching in the summer, considering how much you can spend on vacation, to be with the new TV for the new year.  For such long periods there will be a further scenario, while we are considering those who are about to buy. <br><br>  As for the phone case, most likely the remaining letters are not needed.  The subscriber is probably lured by a discount coupon, which he is already ready to apply. <br><br>  So everything is individual.  Here you know better.  Suppose the order period is two weeks. <br><br>  <strong>2. Divide this period into intervals</strong> (size at one‚Äôs discretion) and have time to benefit the subscriber, make a good impression on him and offer to buy from you. <br><br>  Usually, the maximum percentage of opening letters in the first 2-5.  Suppose the last letter with the proposal should go away in two weeks.  We will send evenly.  We will send three more letters with valuable information and a fourth with a stock or other reason to buy from you right now. <br><br><h4>  <strong>Digest it all, get about the next series of letters</strong> </h4><br><ul><li>  <strong>Immediately</strong> : a letter with "Thank you for the subscription" and the fact that they promised for the subscription </li><li>  <strong>Day 3, article</strong> : "What to look for when choosing a TV" </li><li>  <strong>Day 7, article</strong> : "Which TV is better: LG, Sony or Vityaz" </li><li>  <strong>10 day, customer photos with TVs, reviews</strong> (instead of a story about yourself): "Which TVs are most often bought by our customers" </li></ul><br><br>  This is the fastest, easiest thing to do.  It will already be many times better than most.  We will do things more difficult. <br><br><h4>  <strong>General recommendations for these letters</strong> </h4><br><br>  <strong>1. In no case do not paint the letters.</strong>  If they are not drawn by an experienced designer, then only two options: text in black or dark gray and white.  The only way. <br><br>  <strong>2. If there are a lot of goods and it is impossible to make a targeted distribution of recommendations, we still apply the same principle: we fulfilled our promise, brought benefits, told about ourselves, offered to buy.</strong>  In this case, a coupon for a discount or sale of each type of goods that are most often purchased will work.  Since we still do not know what the subscriber wanted to buy. <br><br>  <strong>3. There is a sale of some very cheap product, just to transfer the subscriber to the buyer.</strong>  We will continue to sell, but you need to evaluate the profitability of such a move. <br><br>  <strong>4. Articles can be a regular letter or announcement with reference to the site.</strong>  <strong>The link is better</strong> , since opening a letter does not mean reading it (just like going to the site).  The visitor can order something ahead of time if things interesting to him appear around the article.  In addition, the statistics will show the number of clicks in the letter, this figure will be closer to determining the number of people interested in your products and interest in your mailing list. <br><br>  <strong>5. Mailing material should not be far-fetched.</strong>  Nonsense and advertising will not be read.  Copywriter for 1.5U / 1k on advego is only suitable for throwing ideas, you need 3-5 such writers.  The benchmark value of the article: 2500-5000 rubles.  This or professionals or write yourself, if you understand.  If not, you can find all the information on the Internet on the topic and make it a very specific and useful squeeze. <br><br>  <strong>Until you have sent at least a thousand letters, you don‚Äôt need to optimize and test anything.</strong>  <strong>There are no statistics yet.</strong>  If there is a frank heresy in the letters, you will quickly tell you this.  The adequacy of individual opinions of readers also need to be assessed, also adequately.  General statistics is more important. <br><br><h3>  Next, we start to complicate - we hold the action </h3><br><br>  In the process of mailing, our subscribers will be divided into two parts.  The first are those who have already bought.  Further they will go according to the scenario of clients.  With the remaining 99.9% still work and work.  As we previously determined, the selection period is two weeks.  So we are making a new series of letters for an offer to buy.  We will do a two-day campaign. <br><br>  Let's call the new series ‚ÄúPromotion for subscribers digistr.ru # 1‚Äù.  The rest will be called # 2, # 3, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/88d/c21/d19/88dc21d19a0707af9bcb8b3b8d49a9b0.png" width="660" height="376"><br><br>  We select the same list of subscribers with the ‚ÄúCustom‚Äù series type.  Now we need to adjust the time of sending.  This parameter will need to be tested in the future, but for now just a helmet in the morning on weekdays. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/62f/c6a/f06/62fc6af06a83fd22e33b26ff4148f79d.png" width="666" height="653"><br><br>  And we add three letters to it with the start of distribution within 14 days from the moment of subscription.  Approximately the following meaning, as in the image. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/5be/52f/e64/5be52fe64d953ce09f39aad544c5c72d.png" width="763" height="600"><br><br>  Please note that for the series we set the departure time at 7.00 am.  This means that the first letter will leave after 14 days from the date of subscription to the newsletter at 7.00, the second the next day, too, at 7.00.  The third is at 14.00 of the second day, seven hours later from the previous second letter. <br><br>  The meaning of this series is as follows.  Here we are typical mailers of incredible stocks.  But without this in any way.  Without sales, sales will not increase.  We hope your subscribers who do not buy at least forgive you.  It depends on the quality of the previous letters. <br><br>  <strong>1. It is necessary to notify about the action and will appoint a reasonable time for it.</strong>  ‚ÄúHave time to buy a TV only today‚Äù - does not work.  Sometimes you should add a letter like ‚ÄúIn two days we plan to make an action‚Äù - to warn in advance if the purchase is expensive. <br><br>  <strong>2. It is necessary to remind about the course of the action.</strong>  Part of the audience thinks ‚Äúwell, I'll order tomorrow‚Äù and forget it. <br><br>  3. Partly because of the forgetfulness, the last letter was made several hours before the end of the working day.  The second reason for this letter is to <strong>influence those who are afraid of missing the last opportunity</strong> . <br><br><h4>  <strong>Recommendations for this series of letters</strong> </h4><br><br>  1. When you have a very large store and there are many subscribers (from 10,000), it is advisable to program your store additionally in order to keep track of those who have already bought.  No need to send them extra letters.  In the meantime, <strong>just consider when writing texts of letters that they will be read by those who have already bought them</strong> . <br><br>  <strong>2. The link to the action should be on the landing page</strong> : either with a selection of promotional items, or on a separate <strong>landing page</strong> with details.  It is impossible that the visitor had to look for something on the site.  The exception is when the sale of everything and when ordering any product will be a gift. <br><br>  3. Despite the urgency and limited nature of the action, the text cannot be ‚Äúhysterical !!!!!‚Äù, the letter must also be black-and-white or design.  In general, the <strong>usual normal letter, just with information about the action</strong> . <br><br>  <strong>4. In no case can not sell the goods on the promotional conditions after the completion of the action.</strong>  No customer arguments should act on you.  Otherwise, the next action will be the thought "Ay, then I agree, so there lovers trade."  And there should be ‚ÄúOh!  We must take it sooner, but I will not have time! ‚Äù  The resulting benefits will now result in large losses in further work with this client.  You will still have promotions for every holiday, buyers should know that they must be in time. <br><br>  <strong>You now have a good selling script for new subscribers.</strong>  <strong>This scenario can be improved as follows.</strong> <br><br>  Send a stock letter and make sure that it is opened.  The following letters are sent only to those who opened the first.  For those who have not opened within two days, repeat the sending of the first letter.  This will increase the coverage of participants in the action.  In the above example, we make two letters each day, which covers this drawback a little.  For starters, enough.  Already in the course of work, more adequate requirements for mailing scenarios will be formed. <br><br>  A week after the promotion, you can send a letter asking why you didn‚Äôt buy what was wrong.  It helps to collect feedback and improve newsletters.  But this also requires additional individual integration.  The store platform should be able to create mailing lists for stocks in the mailing service.  Then you can set up a series on the list ‚ÄúNot bought in action number 1‚Äù created by the platform. <br><br>  Further, we believe that those who managed to buy - go to the scenarios for customers, and the rest in the general distribution script.  Now consider these two scenarios. <br><br><br><br><h2>  Scenario for customers </h2><br><br>  By clients, we will mean those who have just bought something from us.  Mailimpimp allows you to receive data about orders (number and amount of the order) and products (category, name, article, price), and then set up a series of letters, taking into account this data. <br><br>  We need to create a separate list of subscribers to which we will add customers and configure your store platform.  She should send the information on purchases and on the buyers themselves to Mailchimp when these orders are created. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/726/6bf/ec4/7266bfec42dff258018fc5b98715c9e6.png" width="907" height="709"><br><br><br><br><h3>  Immediately after the purchase we do pre-sale </h3><br><br>  Since the customer has already bought something from you, it is easier for him to buy from you again.  And if you offer customers something useful, depending on their purchase, then some people will agree to re-order. <br><br>  For pre-sale there are simple, advanced and sniper options. <br><br><h4>  <strong>Easy way - landing page segmentation</strong> </h4><br><br>  This is when we sell something about the same and it is easy to pick up a universal additional product.  To do this, go to the section "Account / Integrations".  Turn on "Goal" and install the counter code on your website. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/966/7fe/5f8/9667fe5f835865ba2c0dd7161014bcb8.png" width="660" height="442"><br><br>  After that we create a series of letters for the list of clients with the ‚ÄúCustom‚Äù type.  We specify the condition ‚ÄúVisited URL‚Äù as a trigger.  We specify as the parameter the address of the page, which on the site is considered to be the page of the issued order.  Usually this page is like ‚ÄúThank you, your order is accepted‚Äù. <br><br><blockquote>  For example, for stores on our platform Digistr.ru specify the address of the form "http://vashmagazin.ru/cart?order_id".  Without quotes. </blockquote><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/3cb/f43/ef0/3cbf43ef0373c00746d50a7497bbb981.png" width="745" height="646"><br><br>  All other settings are made on the same principles as previously described. <br><br>  As a recommendation, you can use the pre-sale as a share: for two days with two reminders.  Then the general scenario for buyers will look like this: Bought -&gt; In the morning I received a letter with an offer to purchase -&gt; Next morning a reminder -&gt; A few hours before the end of the day another reminder. <br><br>  Of course, such an action must be coordinated with the action for subscribers.  If we make a newsletter from which people will get on the customer list, then immediately doing such a two-day pre-sale with three letters will be strange.  In this case, it‚Äôs enough just one letter the next day or every other day: ‚ÄúWe still recommend it.‚Äù  Just consider this in the setup of a series of letters. <br><br><h4>  <strong>Advanced method - price segmentation</strong> </h4><br><br>  We use the following rule.  If the client has bought something for X rubles, then he can offer 2-3 options for additional goods in the amount of 0.1X, 0.3X and 0.5X.  That is, the client can buy something else in the amount of 10-50% of the one that he has already bought.  With additional products you can experiment in the future.  for now it is enough to pick up just reasonable options. <br><br>  To do this, we make a few series on different price segments.  For example, if you buy some, an average of 5,000 rubles, others for 10,000 and some for 50,000, then we make three more series of letters. <br><br>  For example, let's make a series on buyers about 10 thousand per order.  Specify the list for distribution - our customers and again select the type "Custom".  In the triggers, specify ‚ÄúWith any order‚Äù and add the segmentation condition ‚ÄúE-commerce / Spent (Average Per Order)‚Äù.  This condition is the average price of the order, it is most suitable from the rest.  If you take the total amount of orders (Spent / Total) or for one order (Spent / One order), then the customer can ‚Äúget rid‚Äù of all series with time.  But maybe you want to do it.  We indicate two price ranges of about 10 thousand with the condition ‚Äúall‚Äù to be fulfilled. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/902/924/ce1/902924ce125257339f9cc867cc8263ce.png" width="919" height="707"><br><br>  Further, everything is similar to the previous series. <br><br><h4>  <strong>Sniper scenario with segmentation by category or product</strong> </h4><br><br>  When you have many different categories of goods, then for each category we make our own series.  It's long and boring, but your suggestions will be incredibly targeted.  For starters, you can make such a series on the most popular categories of goods and offer related ones. <br><br>  Again we select the list of clients, the ‚ÄúCustom‚Äù type and as a trigger specify ‚ÄúOrder from a certain category‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/9c8/d1c/fbd/9c8d1cfbd86c8f24842bfba63bf14647.png" width="742" height="351"><br><br>  The list of categories will appear only when the platform sends at least one order with goods from this category.  To add the entire list of categories to customize the series, make a test order, in which add one product from each category.  Then all the categories will be in Mailchimpe. <br><br>  Further, everything is standard in this series is configured.  And yes, if you wish, you can configure such series at the level of purchased goods.  This is advisable if you have only 10-50 relatively different products and they need different related products. <br><br>  In the same series of pre-sales add another letter, which let them go in 5-7 days from the last letter of the pre-sale, when everything calms down.  In it, request a review of the purchase and an opinion about your store. <br><br><br><br>  Thus, you have already set up sales for subscribers, made additional sales to customers and requested feedback from them.  Great job! <br><br>  For the remaining 97-99% of your base, we include the third scenario of mailings - a common one. <br><br><br><br><h2>  General mailing - she has three goals </h2><br><br>  <strong>1. To benefit.</strong>  We regularly write something useful and valuable.  Once a week, two or once a month.  You can make a new series of letters for subscribers and customers (these will be two series), which begin 10 days from the end of all mailings, that is, 25 days from the moment you get on the list.  By adding letters to these series, all new subscribers will continue to receive these letters.  No need to send out manually.  When adding a new letter in this case, put a tick "Send to all existing subscribers." <br><br>  <strong>2. Build trust and increase loyalty to your store.</strong>  In the process of mailing we arrange surveys and ask the opinion of visitors for any reason.  Polls can be done similarly in 2-3 letters for those who have not read or forgotten.  Sometimes we add new customer reviews to these letters, tell the stories of our store. <br><br>  <strong>3. Sell.</strong>  On holidays or when significant new products are released, we arrange actions according to the following scheme: warning, notification of the beginning, reminder in the process, reminder at the end.  The main thing here is not to overdo it: 4-5 letters are a lot.  Therefore it is better to do some actions with one letter.  One of the types of shares "Raffle" or "Lottery".  It is held as a regular action, but after it comes another letter of gratitude for participation and feedback from customers who took part in it. <br><br>  <strong>Correct answers, how often to send on what topic there is no letter.</strong>  The main thing is not to bother, not to write nonsense, to be adequate.  The level of irritability with your customers needs to be checked over time.  Start with one letter a week or two. <br><br>  Customize the scripts of these letters on the patterns above - your homework.  From the first time it may not work, but after the first thousand letters sent it will become more and more clear. <br><br><br><br><h3>  What remains behind the scenes and what to strive for </h3><br><br>  <strong>1. Transactional letters.</strong>  When you can deeply track the visitor's behavior on the site, the frequency of visits, the status of opening or non-opening of letters, etc.  So far we have done simple transactions based on orders and viewing a specific page. <br><br>  <strong>2.
