In fact, these materials are called "photos of Nazi symbols, which are open and accessible to an unlimited number of users."  Although in reality it was a documentary about Kolovrat, and screenshots from this video were attached to the case.  The case was considered so quickly that they were taken directly from the prosecutor's office of Alexander to the court, and from there to immediately serve the sentence. <br><br>  Where is the likelihood that tomorrow some of your friends will not mark you in the photo with the image of the swastika, and will you serve the same administrative punishment?  I would like to hear the opinion of the habravchan on this account and find out whether similar precedents occurred in other regions? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>History details:</b> <br>  On September 25, 2013, Alexander (Naberezhnye Chelny) was brought a summons from the center for countering extremism, and the agenda was framed illiterately, it did not say on which issue to come and as someone.  On the recommendation of a lawyer, Alexander did not go to the survey on such an agenda. <br>  On September 26, Alexander's lawyer phoned the security officer who called Sasha.  He said that in 2012, a swastika was posted on Sasha‚Äôs ‚ÄúVKontakte‚Äù page, and they want to talk to Sasha, find out if it‚Äôs a page or not.  He said that since Sasha did not come, his case was handed over to the prosecutor‚Äôs office, and the agenda was sent to the prosecutor‚Äôs office the next day on September 27th.  When asked where Sasha‚Äôs address and phone <b>number</b> came from, the security officer said that <b>the contact page was registered on the phone number</b> that they called and got to Sasha.

      Before going to the prosecutor, they looked at Alexander's wall for VKontakte for a long time, no suspicious photos were found on the wall.  While we got to the records of 2012, three hours went by continuously viewing the wall.  It is not clear how the anti-extremism officer found a video with a swastika on his page.  How persistent it was to search for these materials on the wall? <br><br>  Since it is strictly obligatory to come to the prosecutor‚Äôs office, the next day, September 27, Sasha went to the prosecutor‚Äôs office with a lawyer, the lawyer was not allowed to visit the prosecutor.  Everything was very fast in the prosecutor's office; a report was made on him according to part 1, no.  20.3 of the Administrative Code of the Russian Federation - Propaganda and public demonstration of Nazi paraphernalia or symbols, or public demonstration of paraphernalia or symbols of extremist organizations. It turned out that Nazi symbols were found not even in pictures, but in a video that told about the use of the swastika in antiquity and in cultures of different nations such kolovrat and so on. <br>  And according to Sasha, screenshots of frames from the video were attached to the materials of the case, and the images were very blurry. <br>  As a result, Sasha, as a person who committed a dangerous offense, was sent to court from the prosecutor's office, and they were not allowed to go to court in their car.  There was a feeling that the prosecutor knew that he would be arrested in court, therefore he insisted so. <br><br>  In court, the judge rejected three petitions by Sasha: one to postpone the consideration of the case due to the fact that he did not have time to get acquainted with the case file in two hours, which took place between the campaign to the prosecutor and the beginning of the court session.  The second is about postponing the consideration of the case due to the fact that he has the constitutional right to qualified legal assistance and needs the help of a lawyer.  And the third is that the meeting should be rescheduled at his place of residence - in 90% of such cases hearings are postponed, but the court was not a district one, but a city one.  The fact that Sasha did not have time to get acquainted with the materials of the case, the judge said that Sasha had to get acquainted with the materials from the prosecutor and ask the lawyer to help him in advance. <br><br>  As a result, he was immediately taken out of the courtroom in handcuffs, and they began to use the penalty of administrative arrest for 5 days immediately.  Sasha was immediately taken to a special detention center at the Internal Affairs Directorate for the maintenance of persons arrested in administrative order, the city of Naberezhnye Chelny, there is still there.  He feels fine, he says. <br><br>  As I learn, I will write further details here. <br>  <b>UPD 1</b> : <a href="http://vk.com/russkiy7">vk.com/russkiy7</a> scans the page address is specified with an error <br>  <b>UPD 2</b> : Communicated with a lawyer.  I learned that this mol. Man had previously been actively involved in social life, but he was taken under special control when he participated and helped in organizing events of the party "Volia".  Today, Alexander should release, I hope I will receive the case files and immediately publish them here. <br>  <b>UPD 3</b> Clarified, Alexander will be released only on Wednesday 2 October.  Only after that it will be possible to get access to the case file. <br>  <b>UPD 4</b> 03/10/2013 - Video due to which this story.  The name is easy to find in contact: <i>Swastika - Not fascist and non-Nazi symbols!</i>  <i>Take a look and make sure!</i>  Duration 3:30 <br>  <b>UPD 5</b> October <b>3,</b> 2013 - case materials, as promised, you can <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/flyer2001/album/205239/%3Fp%3D0">see here</a> and the <a href="http://naberezhno-chelninsky.tat.sudrf.ru/modules.php%3Fname%3Dsud_delo%26srv_num%3D2%26name_op%3Dcase%26case_id%3D106145538%26result%3D1%26delo_id%3D1500001">proof of the case</a> on the official website of the court <br>  That's all I wanted to say.
