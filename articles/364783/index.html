      To get a good result on the GMAT exam, you need to work hard.  This test provides a comprehensive assessment of the level of knowledge and analytical skills, which allows you to see the degree of readiness of the candidate to study at a higher educational institution.  It is because of these features that the preparation for the GMAT should cover various areas of knowledge, allowing you to get the most important and necessary skills. <br><br>  First of all, you need to work on improving the English language.  To understand all the requirements and conditions of GMAT you need to know it at least at the Upper-Intermediate level.  Therefore, during preparation, it is necessary to engage in vocabulary expansion, placing particular emphasis on academic and scientific terms.  You also need to devote time to in-depth study of grammar and norms of the English language, without knowing which it will be very difficult to complete the Sentence Correction assignments and the written test section.  You also need to carefully examine the <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/tests/struktura-gmat/">structure of the exam</a> and get acquainted with the various types of his assignments.  This will allow not only a better orientation during the actual testing, but also will provide an opportunity to properly prepare a training plan.  By using the knowledge of GMAT features, you can make your learning more effective. <br><br>  <b>GMAT Verbal</b> <br><br>  Reading books and a variety of literature allows you to expand your vocabulary and learn to understand the printed text, defining the main idea in it.  All this is sure to be useful not only for understanding the conditions of tasks, but also for their implementation.  Preparing for GMAT should be done by working out each section.  So, preparing for the tasks of the Verbal section, it is recommended to master the technique of fast reading.  With this useful skill, you can save a lot of time on the exam. <br><br>  <b>GMAT AWA</b> <br><br>  In the Analytical Writing section, you need to write a beautiful and competent essay with a thoughtful structure in 30 minutes.  It‚Äôs not easy without good preparation.  Therefore, it is necessary to practice a lot and persistently in writing texts on various topics.  It is very good if they are checked by an experienced teacher who can find lexical and grammatical errors and help with their correction. <br><br>  <b>GMAT Quantitative &amp; Integrated Reasoning</b> <br><br>  The mathematical section (Quantitative) provides solutions to various problems in arithmetic, statistics and geometry.  Despite its seriousness, this section is considered the easiest in the entire exam.  When preparing, it is enough just to repeat the school curriculum and practice in performing various exercises.  It will be much more difficult to cope with questions from the Integrated Reasoning section.  To answer them correctly, you need to learn how to analyze data from different sources and make reasoned conclusions. <br><br>  Testing analytical skills is the basis of the entire test.  It is this skill that is evaluated in all sections, so its development must be given the most important role.  And the only way at the moment to expand their analytical skills is through practical training.  Practice is the main component of success.  And it should cover absolutely all sections of the exam.  It is necessary to learn how to perform the tasks of the verbal, mathematical and written section in conditions as close as possible to the real test. <br><br>  To do this, you can find trial interactive exercises on the Internet or buy a special manual with a disc on which trial tests and practical tasks are recorded.  Nevertheless, the chances of successful passing the test will increase significantly if the training is conducted under the guidance of an experienced teacher who can point out errors, teach the basics of analysis and demonstrate it with real examples. <br><br>  <a href="http://gmat-test.ru/podgotovka-k-gmat.html">Preparing for a GMAT</a> covers a wide range of skills, so you need to develop your own learning strategy before starting it.  The study plan will allow you to move in the direction that will be able to provide all the necessary knowledge and guarantee a good result. <br><br>  <b>What are the main benefits of preparing for testing at specialized courses?</b> <br><br>  Classes are held with an experienced teacher, who will tell you about all the specific features of the test.  This will help avoid standard errors.  You will learn about the gaps in your knowledge, you can consult about the literature, talk to a person who has already passed the exam independently. <br><br>  On the courses you will write a test test and an essay, which will be checked and analyzed in detail by the teacher.  You will be provided with proven textbooks that have been developed by leading experts in the field of GMAT preparation. <br>  You will save a lot of time, because you do not have to analyze a huge amount of information that is offered in the network, you will be provided with it in the optimum time. <br><br>  <b>GMAT individual preparation program</b> <br><br>  If you are a busy person whose life flows according to a very complex work schedule, you are constantly on the road and there is no possibility to attend classes in a group regularly, then the ideal option for preparing for the GMAT would be individual lessons with a teacher. <br><br>  <a href="http://gmat-test.ru/repetitor-gmat-ili-individualnaya-podgotovka-k-testu.html">An experienced specialist</a> will be able to quickly and efficiently prepare you for the exam;  He will develop a special test preparation program personally for the student.  In the classroom you will learn all the necessary information about the intricacies of the exam.  Based on the level of your knowledge and training, the tutor will set the right direction for working with the most difficult moments.  In addition, the teacher will offer you additional material, advise literature that will help you pass the exam for the desired score. <br><br>  The teacher will develop with you an individual time management strategy that can be used directly in the exam.

Naturally, on the Internet you can find a huge number of test tests, methods, tips and other information.  All this will be useful only if you have already developed your test preparation program.  Therefore, we should not neglect the basic guidelines for preparing for the GMAT from the world's best experts. <br><br>  First of all, you should pay attention to the following tutorials, in which you will find a large number of trial tasks, as well as excellent descriptions of the test structure, a lot of useful tips that can be used during the test: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Official-Review-Online-Question-Exclusive/dp/1118914090/">Official Guide for GMAT Review</a> ; <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kaplan-GMAT-Premier-Practice-Tests/dp/161865053X/">Kaplan GMAT Premier Program</a> ; <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Complete-GMAT-Strategy-Guide-Set/dp/1941234100/">Manhattan GMAT</a> ; <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Computer-Adaptive-Practice-Graduate-Preparation/dp/0804124949/">Princeton Review</a> ; <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Barrons-GMAT-Bobby-Umar/dp/1438002319/">Barron's GMAT</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1ae/587/cd6/1ae587cd6d1f4007abd802227ab3c57f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>GMAT Preparation Online</b> <br><br>  When preparing for the GMAT, we recommend not only passing the courses, completing the tasks in the textbooks, but also paying attention to the ways of preparing for the GMAT online. <br><br>  For more effective preparation, you can take the GMAT test exam online.  So you not only try your hand, evaluate the level of knowledge, but also analyze your strengths and weaknesses.  All this will undoubtedly be useful for you to adjust the training plan, to get acquainted with the exemplary procedure of the exam. <br><br>  You can take a trial test as many times as you think necessary, and with each attempt you will feel more confident. <br><br>  Now on the Internet there is a huge variety of tests GMAT online, below are the most common ones: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://www.mba-info.ru/tests.php">www.mba-info.ru/tests.php</a> <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://www.testpreppractice.net/GMAT/Free-Online-GMAT-Practice-Tests.aspx">www.testpreppractice.net/GMAT/Free-Online-GMAT-Practice-Tests.aspx</a> <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://www.4tests.com/exams/examdetail.asp%3Feid%3D31">www.4tests.com/exams/examdetail.asp?eid=31</a> <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://www.platinumgmat.com/gmat-practice-test/">www.platinumgmat.com/gmat-practice-test/</a> <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://gmat.jumbotests.com/tests/online-gmat-quiz">www.gmat.jumbotests.com/tests/online-gmat-quiz</a> <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://www.800score.com/download4.html">www.800score.com/download4.html</a> <br><br>  We recommend to pass all tests to get a hand. <br><br>  Despite the fact that GMAT online tests help well in preparation, it should be noted that they are unlikely to imitate the real exam.  First, you are testing at home at the computer, and not in a specialized center, where you are unlikely to feel comfortable. <br><br>  In addition, as a rule, not all types of questions that will be met in the real exam are included in the test tests.  For example, most online assessments do not include AWA (Assessment of Analytic Writing) and Integrated Reasoning. <br>  You will also be offered no more than 10 tasks, while the exam questions are much more. <br><br>  <i>Our next article will tell about the <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/tests/registratsiya-i-sdacha-gmat/">registration and passing of the GMAT test</a> .</i>  <i>We remind you that this is a fairly important event, so we recommend to follow our publications.</i> <br><br>  The author of the article is Vyacheslav Davidenko, founder of <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/">MBA Consult</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/364783/">https://habr.com/ru/post/364783/</a></p>
