  <section class="page js-page"><h1>C ++ Russia and after</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello! <br><br>  At the end of February in Moscow with the support of Kaspersky Lab, JetBrains, PVS-Studio and IncrediBuild the C ++ Russia, 2015 conference was held: 2 days, 2 tracks, 16 reports, 300 participants. <br><br>  We recently posted slides of all reports and continue to work on video processing.  Under the cat a brief description, the general impression of the conference from the side of the organizer, work on the mistakes, plans for the future. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Opened the conference Sean Parent.  In the process of preparing the conference, I was surprised to learn that few C ++ programmers had heard of it.  If you have never seen his speeches, I recommend to read.  He sometimes says unexpected things, but always explains very clearly why he decided to say this.

      There were several guests from Europe: Bartosz Milewski, Zoltan Porkolab, Rainer Grimm, Guntram Berti, Ivan Cukic.  We hoped that there would be more guests, so we asked for English presentations if possible.  However, while they were dealing with the sale of tickets in Europe, all the tickets were sold.  It was not possible to learn how interesting it was for foreign participants to come to Russia. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/86a/389/3f1/86a3893f17424749063fe217636e15d1.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>All your base are belong to us !!</i> <br><br>  The main objective of the conference is a live professional communication, so it‚Äôs great that almost every report started a discussion.  We had to strictly follow the time to follow the schedule. <br><br><h1>  Bug work </h1><br>  I will not do a detailed analysis of the reports, and retell the content.  I will better describe the mistakes that have been made, which need to be worked on. <br><br><h3>  Conference program </h3><br>  The most frequent question I heard was ‚ÄúWhere can I get a program.‚Äù  The schedule was on the site and we decided not to make a paper version: it-event, all gadgets.  In vain.  Firstly, our site looks awful from mobile (yes, we are C ++ developers).  Secondly, not all gadgets. <br><br><h3>  Hall A </h3><br>  The largest room looked good in the evening and was empty, but it turned out to be a terrible day.  It was visible and heard it was bad, constant extraneous noises.  We have made certain conclusions for ourselves, we will try not to make any more mistakes. <br><br><h3>  Conference site </h3><br>  Not only does the site look awful, it does not work as we want.  We will look for resources to do everything right. <br><br><h3>  check in </h3><br>  At our previous meetings we tried to use QR codes on registration.  It worked well, and we decided at the conference to mark the arrivals using the QR code on the ticket.  But <i>something went wrong</i> and we were not ready for it.  Next time we will have a fallback. <br><br><h3>  T-shirts for organizers </h3><br>  The organizers were not marked in any way, so sometimes it was difficult to find us.  Fix it. <br><br><h3>  There was no lunch </h3><br>  More precisely: when buying a ticket it was not possible to add food to the ticket.  We recognize our guilt.  Meru.  Power.  Depth  Now we will sell tickets with and without dinner. <br><br><h3>  Report language </h3><br>  The reports were in Russian and in English, but the schedule did not indicate the language of the report.  Yes, we will indicate the language. <br><br>  All these comments were received from the reviews, there are still notes made in the margins, but about them some other time. <br><br><h1>  Thanks to all </h1><br>  I saw this conference from a completely different angle.  For me, it has become a constant communication with interesting new people, solving small and big problems, financial reporting, taxes.  This is a very interesting experience and I am very grateful to the people who helped me get this experience (especially reports and taxes, yes). <br><br>  A good half of the Russian speakers are the regulars of the C ++ hub.  Thank you guys so much!  Without you there would not be such a wonderful event. <br><br>  Thanks to all participants!  Without you, too, it is unlikely that something happened.  I am glad that we managed to bring together so many people who are interested in C ++. <br><br>  Special thanks to the people who gave valuable advice on the organizational part. <br><br><h1>  Down and Out trouble started </h1><br>  It's time to discuss how meetings and conferences will continue. <br><br><h3>  Meetings </h3><br>  There are obviously not enough resources to hold six free meetings a year now, but we will try to keep up the pace and make three or four meetings (every two to three months).  While there are plans for the next six months: Veliky Novgorod and St. Petersburg. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Why Great Novgorod?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  It's simple: I live here.  Plus, the city is in three hours by train from St. Petersburg and at 8 hours from Moscow.  For all participants of the meeting a walking tour of the city is free ;-) Previously, the meeting will take place on April 25, but better follow the information on the site. <br></div></div><br>  If you want to arrange a C ++ meeting in your city, let's write down.  I will help with advice, search for speakers, support information. <br><br><h3>  Conferences </h3><br>  We decided to try this mode: to hold one conference a year in the European part and one on the other side of the Ural Mountains. <br><br>  The next conference will be held in Novosibirsk on August 28-29 at the Expocenter.  The program is still being formed, and we are happy to discuss any proposals.  Tickets, by the way, can already be <a href="https://c-user-group-russia.timepad.ru/event/188890/">bought</a> . <br><br><h1>  Reports </h1><br>  Requirements for reports remain the same: C ++, 50 minutes, preliminary run on Skype.  There were proposals to make one section of blitz reports (no more than 15 minutes).  If this format is interesting and there are enough speakers, we are ready to try. <br><br>  You can submit a report to a meeting or conference <a href="http://meetingcpp.ru/%3Fpage_id%3D63">here</a> .  More reports, good and different! <br><br>  See you later! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/252505/">https://habr.com/ru/post/252505/</a></p>
