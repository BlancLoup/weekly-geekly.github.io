The meaning of the statements does not affect. </blockquote></div></div><br><h3 id="vmesto-vstupleniya">  Instead of intro </h3><br><p>  Today, most Companies remain built in a functional way and are a mechanism with a set of functions.  These functions are distributed among divisions where they are performed by executing employees.  In carrying out their highly specialized tasks, workers no longer see the end results of the work of the entire enterprise and become aware of their place in the common chain.  They are no longer focused on the Company's target tasks, since their vision of what is happening most often does not go beyond the framework of their own divisions in which they work.  The monopoly position of each service within the Company leads to the fact that the employees of these services consider themselves indispensable, which is why interaction between functional departments and services often becomes destructive for them.  By and large, this situation is not good, but not bad;  it is none. </p><br><h3 id="pro-dolzhnostnye-instrukcii">  About job descriptions </h3><br><blockquote> <strong>Important!</strong> <br>  Unfortunately, in the modern world (especially in the Russian Federation) job descriptions are not at all regarded as a powerful tool contributing to a positive effect on increasing the efficiency of workers' activities.  The situation is stalemate initially: the law never stipulates the requirement for a job description, HR specialists do not have time / effort / desire to write (choose 2 out of 3), line managers set aside for later, subordinates are not at all interested in them, because .  The courts in most cases make decisions in favor of the employee if they do not exist (based on the judicial practice of the city of Moscow). </blockquote><p>  The attitude to the question of the presence or absence of job descriptions in general can be expressed in 4 groups: </p><br><ol><li>  <strong>Instructions should be</strong> .  Such an approach is rare, but some managers and employees of HR services are convinced that the Companies need instructions developed for each position, since  Without them, it is extremely difficult to organize the effective work of the staff.  However, many do not fully understand what their presence can give, but they strive to make them as high-quality as possible.  Up to 15% of Companies. </li><li>  <strong>No instructions are needed</strong> .  There are many more people who believe that the instructions play no role in the management of human resources.  Therefore, there is no job description in such Companies, especially since the law does not require it.  This approach can be found in about 30% of Companies. </li><li>  <strong>Instructions are needed, but their quality does not matter.</strong>  With this approach, the job description has nothing to do with the actual activities of the Company's employees.  You can safely give more than 50% of the total. </li><li>  <strong>Instructions - this is a management tool</strong> - the most effective approach, but it is used by only a very small number of Companies, up to 5% of the total.  It lies in the fact that relevant instructions are not only created, but also regularly reviewed and updated, and are actively used in practice. </li></ol><br><p>  In general, we can talk about two approaches to the creation of job descriptions: the Western and the Russian.  The western approach is to write very short instructions, where the description of the functional takes literally a few lines.  At the same time, a separate regulation is created for each of the functions, where it is described in more detail. <br>  The Russian approach is expressed in the fact that the instruction describes the functionality as fully as possible, without additional references to the regulations. </p><br><p>  Regardless of the approach to creation, the goals of the job descriptions can be formulated as follows: </p><br><ol><li>  Clear regulation of the obligations of the parties to the employment contract (transparency of labor relations), both at the stage of recruitment and in the process of employment. </li><li>  Determination of the employee‚Äôs specific work functions, detalization of the procedure for his actions, limitation of his area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility and limits of authority. </li><li>  To be a guide to action, as well as a basis for resolving disputes in the event of disagreement (between an employee and an employer, between employees within a structural unit, between structural divisions, in court). </li><li>  Become a tool for evaluating personnel and, of course, corporate business process management. </li></ol><br><p>  Job descriptions are a necessary and effective tool for improving business performance.  Their presence allows: </p><br><ul><li>  create a management system that makes the business more transparent and manageable; </li><li>  clearly regulate the main obligations that are taken by the employer and the employee applying for a job, which greatly simplifies the relations of both parties; </li><li>  streamline the work of each structural unit in particular, and the enterprise as a whole; </li><li>  to formulate the labor functions of employees, their areas of responsibility, powers and restrictions in decision making, qualification requirements for the position, functional responsibilities of the person occupying it, the algorithm of actions in standard situations; </li><li>  avoid duplication of functions when performing certain types of work and uneven distribution of load; </li><li>  ensure effective interaction of employees holding different positions in solving production and management tasks; </li><li>  to select high-quality staff: a recruiter, having read the instructions, will be able to competently organize work with the candidates, and the applicant will be able to know in advance what will be required of him in this position; </li><li>  create comfortable conditions for the adaptation of a new employee: if the instructions clearly state what the newcomer should do and within what limits, and who his immediate supervisor is, this will make it easier for him the first days of work; </li><li>  to attract negligent employees to disciplinary responsibility for non-fulfillment of their job duties. </li></ul><br><p>  Like any other toolkit, job description with proper formation and maintenance can be: </p><br><p>  <strong>Business Performance Tool</strong> </p><br><p>  The formal approach to the development of job descriptions, when they are drawn up according to templates, do not correspond to the business objectives, does not reflect the main tasks of the employee in this position, does not aim at achieving the main goal of the Company, leads to the result that useless, inoperative documents are obtained.  In this matter, the attitude to the job descriptions of the employer plays a big role.  If he views them as an effective tool for personnel management, most likely it will be so.  But if the instructions are developed by employees who are far from understanding the real functionality of specialists, their creation will be of no use to anyone. </p><br><p>  Many Companies, having developed job descriptions once, no longer correct them, although business processes periodically undergo certain changes, which should be reflected in the instructions.  In the conditions of strict requirements of modern business, it makes no sense to use job descriptions that do not reveal the specifics of the Company and do not contain strictly fixed tasks, functional responsibilities of staff, a description of the desired result of work and transfer of those responsible for its effectiveness. </p><br><p>  <strong>Motivation management tool</strong> </p><br><p>  In the face of fierce competition, more and more managers began to realize that the main resource that allows them to achieve strategic goals is personnel who need to be given due attention, primarily stimulated, both materially and non-materially.  One of the most effective HR-tools that can help the Company to solve these problems is the system of grades / bands, in the development of which an important role is played by a verified and transparent organizational structure and well-described job descriptions / competencies that avoid many problems and reduce the cost of this procedure . </p><br><p>  <strong>Employee Performance Assessment Tool</strong> </p><br><p>  At any stage of the Company's development, errors and deviations from planned business results are possible.  To minimize such risks, clear planning and control are needed.  The presence in the Company of such an effective management tool that performs an organizational, regulatory and regulatory role, as a job description, simplifies control over employee performance. </p><br><p>  Carried out with the help of job descriptions control over the activity is part of the personnel management system.  The data contained in job descriptions make it possible to quickly assess what an employee needs to do in order to achieve the goals he has set, what measures should be taken to improve the efficiency of his activities.  Detailed job descriptions set the standards and technologies for performing the tasks, which can be supported by both the employee and his manager.  With their help, it is possible to assess how much an employee corresponds to his position, and to apply certain measures of influence to him. </p><br><p>  <strong>Training needs assessment tool</strong> </p><br><p>  Instructions are a great career planning tool if they include a clause on the required knowledge and qualifications.  Using the information from this point, it is very easy to understand what skills one or another employee needs in order to take one or another position. </p><br><h3 id="pro-processy-i-podhody">  Pro processes and approaches </h3><br><blockquote><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Thanks for the section</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The author wants to thank Orphan V.E.  for assistance in preparing the section <br></div></div><br><br>  The author does not seek to impose a process approach, as the only true one.  However, it wants to remind that each functional division of the Company optimizes the activities in its area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility, which, ultimately, may lead to the substitution of the strategic goal of the Company with the target functions of a separate division, which, in turn, leads to inhibition of development of both a separate division and and Companies. </blockquote><p>  Before proceeding you should classify the processes.  In general, it makes sense to classify something only when the groups identified in the classification will be used in the future, and their presence will ‚Äúsimplify‚Äù life.  While it is always necessary to remember that any objects can be classified in different ways, but always retain their common characteristics. </p><br><p>  By <strong>classification</strong> we mean the grouping of objects of study in accordance with their common features, called the basis of classification. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/36/cd/vl/36cdvlmwq7smwubuommkyhg8h10.png"></p><br><p>  Reasons for classifying processes: </p><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">By result payment (business and service)</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  <strong>Business</strong> is a process in which the value created (satisfied need) is paid (directly or indirectly) by a consumer external to the Company. </li><li>  <strong>Service</strong> - a process that is carried out in the interests of the consumer, internal to the Company. </li></ul></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">By hierarchy level (overprocess and subprocess)</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  <strong>The overprocess</strong> is a stable, purposeful system of processes at a lower level (subprocesses in relation to the current one), which generally meets all the requirements for the process. </li><li>  <strong>A subprocess</strong> is an activity element that meets all the requirements for a process and is part of a higher level process (overprocess relative to the current one). </li></ul></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">By level of abstraction (meta-process and process precedent)</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  <strong>Meta-process</strong> - a class of processes of a certain type, obtained as a result of abstraction from an object on which an action is taken and aimed at satisfying a group of needs. </li><li>  <strong>Process use case</strong> is an instance of a process. </li></ul></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Along the boundaries of performance (local and cross-cutting (cross-functional))</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  <strong>A local process</strong> is a process that exists entirely within the framework of the division in whose interests it is operating, i.e.  all participants in the process are employees of the same department. </li><li>  <strong>The cross-functional (cross-functional) process</strong> is a process that is carried out within several divisions, i.e.  some of his tasks (functions, subprocesses) are solved within one division, and some within another. </li></ul></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Total, based on the described classification, we define the process of ensuring information security can be defined as:</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><blockquote>  A continuous process that is carried out in the interests of the internal consumer, affecting all the units acting in the interests of specific individuals, at a particular point in time relative to a specific object, and which is part of a higher level process. </blockquote></div></div><br><p>  Here is a comparison of the characteristics of the Function / Process / Project: </p><br><table><thead><tr><th>  Characteristic </th><th>  Function </th><th>  Process </th><th>  Project </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>  Why is carried out?

Most likely you have a problem in performing the function and the participants are trying to choose the culprit, because the result has not yet been presented. </p></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Special features</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><p>  The functional approach answers the question ‚ÄúWhat to do?‚Äù. </p><br><p>  The functional model is based on the universal principle of division of labor between services, departments, workshops, teams with assignment to them of certain functions (operations). </p><br><p>  Main features <strong>Functions</strong> : </p><br><ul><li>  Context Independence.  Inputs (outputs) are part of the function and their composition and characteristics do not directly depend on their source (receiver), but are set by the control. </li><li>  External management.  The function is controlled ‚Äúfrom the outside‚Äù by setting rules and plans for the work of resources and setting requirements for the result (output).  Decisions on each case are made by the person in charge of management. </li></ul><br><p>  <u>Behavioral patterns:</u> <br>  <strong>Management:</strong> <br>  <em>‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúI gave instructions - let them carry out‚Äù;</em> <em><br></em>  <em>‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúIf something goes wrong - I will refer to the next unit‚Äù;</em> <em><br></em>  <em>‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúWhile it is important that we do our work, we will do as much of our work as possible‚Äù;</em> <br>  <strong>Performers:</strong> <br>  <em>‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care - I do what they say‚Äù;</em> <em><br></em>  <em>‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúMy boss is my consumer: he is satisfied - there is a salary‚Äù;</em> <em><br></em>  <em>‚Ä¢ "Solutions?</em>  <em>This is not a question of my salary! ‚Äù;</em> </p><br><p>  The process approach answers the question ‚ÄúHow to do?‚Äù. </p><br><p>  The process approach in its essence leads to the transition to the so-called ‚Äúlean production‚Äù or ‚Äúlean‚Äù resource-saving organizational structure (Lean production).  The main features of such an organizational structure are: </p><br><p>  wide delegation of powers and responsibilities to performers; </p><br><ul><li>  reducing the number of decision levels; </li><li>  the combination of the principle of target management with the group organization of labor; </li><li>  increased attention to ensuring the quality of products or services, as well as the work of the enterprise as a whole. </li></ul><br><p>  The main features of the <strong>process</strong> : </p><br><ul><li>  Focus.  The purpose of the activity is to satisfy the consumer's need, and there are clear criteria for assessing the achievement of a goal (performance) and the cost of it (efficiency). </li><li>  Constant needs and manufacturability.  The satisfied need is neither one-time nor unique, therefore the process is carried out by performing certain steps (technology). </li><li>  The need can change only after trying to satisfy it, and not during time. </li><li>  Integrity of activity and responsibility.  The process is carried out from the moment of identifying the consumer's need to the moment of its satisfaction, and the one who makes the decision is responsible for the ‚Äúfrom and to‚Äù activity. </li><li>  Manageability "from the inside."  Since there is a responsibility for effectiveness and efficiency, the process implies (requires) management decisions by the process participants themselves.  Moreover, all participants in the process are motivated for its effectiveness and efficiency. </li></ul><br><p>  <u>Behavioral patterns:</u> <br>  <em>‚Ä¢ No goal - no resources!</em> <em><br></em>  <em>‚Ä¢ As patted - and burst!</em> </p><br><p>  The project approach is used for project-oriented companies, for example, research, consulting, construction, etc.  It can be applied to any company when creating innovative products within these projects. </p><br><p>  Main features of the <strong>project</strong> : </p><br><ul><li>  Time constraints.
