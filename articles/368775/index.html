  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Battle mini-drones Byrobot - for the first time in Ukraine</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  During 2015, our colleagues from Tallinn - the RC Land team - talked about their experience in the commercial launch of the ‚Äúattraction‚Äù with fights on the Byrobot drones.  Another business based on outdoor events with the Byrobot Drone Fighter was presented by the Ukrainian company InFly.  In March 2016, the first in Ukraine presentation of Byrobot minicopter was held. <br><br>  In this material, the InFly project manager, Jan Lipnitsky will tell you about his experience. <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/byrobot_russia/blog/274765/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/756/db5/a16/756db5a16705170b7104ea281849c6ee.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  About the idea of ‚Äã‚Äã"school and attraction" </h2><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/257/b73/140/257b731407f595e1910208408d32efbd.jpg"></div><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a company arose almost immediately after becoming acquainted with the Byrobot Drone Fighter - the world's first combat quadcopter combat drones.  At first, I thought about how great it would be to spend time with friends fighting on combat drones.  And then I realized that air battles on copters are a great outdoor entertainment for corporate events and team building.  The final decision on the creation of the company was made within a week after the development of the first version of the business plan, and from the inception of the idea to the first event from InFly, 2 months passed.  The presentation of the fights on the minicopter Byrobot was conducted by our friends from the company Savvy.

In Ukraine, just a couple of companies are engaged not only in the sale of quadcopters, but also in individual drone control training.  And usually you need to come to study with your drone.  Accordingly, all falls, collisions and breakdowns in the process of learning happen with your copter. <br><br>  In InFly, we give training on different models - training takes place on the copers Byrobot Drone Fighter and Syma X5 (about twice as long as the bayrobot).  We help amateurs prepare to the level of a confident pilot who understands control modes and is able to carry out basic flight elements.  Such training will allow you to fill all possible bumps before you start flying on your own copter. <br><br>  It is not easy to be pioneers, but it‚Äôs an honor and promise - we have a fresh niche open and busy.  After all, quadcopters are clearly experiencing a boom and analysts say that public interest in this topic will only grow. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f56/5d8/df1/f565d8df137178f39c919584ec179df9.jpg"></div><br>  <i>Global sales forecast for civilian and military drones</i> <br><br><h2>  What we liked Byrobot </h2><br>  On Geektimes, the pros and cons of the model have already been considered in detail both from the user's point of view ( <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/byrobot_russia/blog/266302/">link</a> ) and from the point of view of commercial exploitation ( <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/rcland/blog/263420/">link</a> ).  I will share my opinion and experience of using Byrobot, having told about some points revealed in practice. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d73/e9c/728/d73e9c728fdf8883d19b8bd3ecea5cc7.jpg"></div><br>  First of all, it is worth noting simple management - both children aged 7-10 years old and literally enough were just ten minutes for adults for more or less confident aerobatics.  Some problems with the first acquaintance with Byrobot arose with control in the "professional mode": with turns around its axis and flights, when the rotor was turned with its front end facing the pilot.  Beginners usually have a hard time getting used to the fact that when the stick moves to the right side, the copter flies in the opposite direction.  However, having flown several batteries, even novice pilots already feel confident when performing such maneuvers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7dd/959/516/7dd959516d7ba87f25a149f21007ac84.jpg"><br><br>  We note in particular the unique Byrobot chip - the ‚Äúautomatic transmission‚Äù, when the electronics take over the entire board by the speed and speed of the flight.  Usually, in drones, the left height stick keeps the position in which it was left, and reacts sharply to changes.  This can be convenient and familiar for pros, but not for novice pilots.  On the contrary, in Byrobot the stick height is always centered with springs, which helps to get comfortable with take-off, descent and acceleration.  For example, if you pull down - Byrobot will begin a gradual decline, not a rapid fall. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5a9/f1f/5dc/5a9f1f5dc2163d4928661b87068d1820.jpg"><br><br>  The next important point is the modular system, when right on the battlefield, without a screwdriver and a soldering iron, you can replace any element of the drone up to the motor and motherboard.  During away events, the client does not like to wait - any breakdown should be fixed as quickly as possible.  We especially liked the fact that absolutely any Byrobot modules are available for sale separately - consoles, motherboards, motors, blades, protection, batteries - everything can be ordered in any quantity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/400/b14/e78/400b14e780633c9b3f88f51516736954.png"><br><br>  Byrobot control panels have repeatedly received praise from our customers.  In fact, they have not yet come up with anything more convenient in terms of ergonomics than the usual console gamepad.  Although in this case - very much reduced.  Durable, "tenacious" and non-staining plastic remotes - also an important plus. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9c8/e2c/012/9c8e2c0124441277806c1eed36c86bf4.jpg"><br><br>  Very convenient and practical that Byrobot uses the same battery for drones and remotes.  If you understand the copters and other radio-controlled models, then you know - in the bulk of the models for the remote you have to buy more batteries, sometimes even six to eight pieces.  This is unacceptable for our business - it is impossible to constantly carry with you a huge backpack of spare batteries in case one of a dozen remotes is discharged! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/517/802/874/51780287468a26b9c34bf54f5b71f708.jpg"><br><br>  Initially, we were not sure about the durability of Byrobot - the use of a printed circuit board as a case raised doubts about the durability of the structure.  However, based on the results of several events, the model showed itself from the best side.  At the moment, with a set of eight copters, we have very minor damage: for all the time three blades and two screw protectors were broken.  We also had problems with one falling copter, but everything was quickly resolved by resetting the settings and updating the firmware with subsequent calibration. <br><br><h2>  And a little tar </h2><br>  Not without drawbacks, but here we will note only a couple of points.  Of course, Byrobot is not cheap, in Russia - 7,890 rubles per set.  However, there are simply no other devices with a combat system and a similar modular design.  And to limit its activities only to training in the management of drones (unsuitable for quick repair) would be completely silly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/750/b98/506/750b98506354e9adc0592f4a708f096b.jpg"><br><br>  I would like to see accelerated charging of batteries in the arsenal.  The proposed hub for four batteries immediately charges one battery in about 10 minutes.  But if you insert all four batteries, the charging time increases by almost half an hour. <br><br>  Finally, the latter concerns the combat system.  When all lives are spent, the copter smoothly lowers, however, after the engine is lowered, it does not turn off automatically.  The model continues to fly 5 cm from the floor, collecting dust, hair, and small debris.  The rest of the noticeable flaws in Byrobot, we could not find. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/067/181/162/0671811624a0c59fbb19579808b49332.jpg"><br><br><h2>  The first presentation of Byrobot in Ukraine </h2><br>  We conducted the presentation of the fights on minicopter with our friends from the company Savvy.  In just three hours, those gathered fully plunged into an exciting game and an incredible friendly atmosphere.  First, we told the theoretical foundations, and the most impatient immediately took up the console and tried out the controls.  And in vain!  After all, the landing of the Byrobot back to the ground is not a tricky business, but it requires knowledge of a certain combination of buttons. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b35/99e/c65/b3599ec65f8e6fe996bfa7fb39b7ecb1.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/000/704/599/000704599e3e34b1a867a1d07a594a79.jpg"><br><br>  When it came to practice, it turned out that children learn the subtleties of piloting even faster than adults! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/697/995/da1/697995da187f972dbec3a381c3f94534.jpg"><br><br>  As we already mentioned, all problems with equipment are solved very quickly - it takes no more than 30 seconds to replace the blade, and you don‚Äôt even need to turn off the copter. <br><br><h2>  InFly at Smart Robo Fest </h2><br>  April 16 at the IT-School Smart held a festival of robotics Smart Robo Fest.  Anyone who wanted could have a closer look at the world of robots and personally try out the role of a drone pilot at the free-of-charge minicopter workshop, which was conducted by InFly.  Our master class gathered about 100 spectators, at least 50 people took up the console for the first time and took part in air battles at Byrobot. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cf0/36c/e15/cf036ce15bae8ccb35a49f94dc3d3979.jpg"></div><br>  This time the main audience among children was at the age of 6-8 years.  And again, I was glad to see how easy and conveniently the Byrobot Drone Fighter control was organized: after a ten-minute practical session, even the youngest pilots did an excellent job of managing Korean combat machines. <br><br><h2>  In perspective </h2><br>  Now InFly works at outdoor events - exhibitions, popular science festivals, corporate parties, team building.  In the near future we plan to open "polygons" in Ukraine, where you can come and fend for yourself at Byrobot copters with friends or children.  The first game room will soon appear in our hometown of Dnipropetrovsk. <br><br>  The experience of past mass events underlines how fascinating the air battles on mini-copters are - there is no doubt about the prospects of this new entertainment.  At the same time, oddly enough, it is impossible to find Byrobot for sale on the Ukrainian market.  Therefore, we plan to become also suppliers of this buzzing Korean miracle of technology in our country. <br><br>  We will certainly keep you up to date with our news! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/368775/">https://habr.com/ru/post/368775/</a></p>
