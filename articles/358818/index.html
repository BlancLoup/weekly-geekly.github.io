  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Summer vacation: how not to worry about the work of your site in vain</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Summer is coming, and everyone wants to relax.  But, as statistics show, not everyone can afford it, and it‚Äôs not only and not so much about the means.  And then, to go to the sea, but to sit there with a laptop in the room, solving the problems of the category ‚Äúwithout-me-not-will-understand‚Äù is also quite a popular approach.  What to do?  Delegate, delegate and delegate.  Why a full vacation is so important, and how you can entrust the care of sites / servers to a special <a href="http://www.host-tracker.com/">service for monitoring the availability of sites</a> - we will tell below. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ed/km/fv/edkmfvty7ak-uhltvsr9oe9weoe.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Why vacation is important </h4><br>  And here it is serious.  Career careers, but the chances of getting something heartfelt, but not at all romance, <a href="http://tastylifemag.ru/world/travel/pochemu-tak-vazhno-otdohnut-ot-raboty-i-vzyat-sebe.html">almost double</a> in those who work a lot and do not allow themselves to have a good rest.  This is quite comparable with the effect of regular smoking, for example.  Depression is on the way, which is not a status on the social network, but one that is treated for a long time and does not go away without a trace.  But the problem is not only in the holidays, but also in its quality and duration.  <a href="https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-012-9345-3">In this extensive publication</a> , for example, analyzed many factors and their changes during the holidays.  A comparison of indicators of health and the number of days of official vacation by country also confirms the need for rest. <br><br>  But in practice, employees of large companies are rarely completely out of business.  And it‚Äôs scary to mention businessmen, freelancers and startups in this context - only a little more than half allow themselves to go on vacation, and only every tenth of this half - at least for 2 weeks.

Indeed, during the holidays, fraudsters and hackers are activated, and the whole range of relatively honest ways of withdrawing money from the population is slightly increasing - from copy-sites designed for immediate profit to the creation of botnets for the future.  Yes, and without them anything happens - the reaction time to the problem grows, therefore, for example, the usual disk overflow can seriously spoil the mood.  Nevertheless, it is still possible to protect yourself and your vacation business.  To a large extent. <br><br><h4>  Monitoring service - how can I help? </h4><br>  With the help of our site monitoring service, you can close a number of important issues.  With that, during the holidays - and generally completely free, using the monthly Trial. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/b4/91/ba/b491ba8h2gk9uk-bma_annpyc0q.png"><br><br><ul><li>  <b>Monitoring site availability</b> ‚Äî get notified when something goes wrong with the site. </li><li>  <b>Content monitoring</b> is a more advanced version of checking the site, check whether everything is loaded. </li><li>  <b><a href="https://habr.com/company/host-tracker/blog/353828/">Check for getting into Roskomnadzor's lists</a></b> - are you sure that the treacherous Telegram is far enough away from you? </li><li>  <b><a href="https://www.host-tracker.com/blog/Domain">The expiration date of the domain and certificate</a></b> - for sure they are lost, then it is during the holidays. </li><li>  <b>Monitoring server response time</b> - catching the ‚Äúbrakes‚Äù;  it is immediately visible if someone decides to remember crypts a little while you are away. </li><li>  <b>Check ping, and a specific port</b> - check various nodes and applications </li><li>  <b>Databases</b> - we can observe from the side both the ability to connect and execute queries / procedures, drawing convenient graphs. </li><li>  <b>Cron</b> - external schedule to jerk certain links at the right time;  can be used for anything; </li><li>  <b>Monitoring CPU, RAM, HDD</b> - catch DDOS, do not forget that you need to clean the logs and all that. </li><li>  And even automatically <a href="https://www.host-tracker.com/blog/adwords_monitoring"><b>stop \ run an AdWords campaign</b></a> , to save money. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/40/vq/rn/40vqrnq5a2qruds_mvddjsl0iki.png"><br>  <i>And here so somewhere one database grows</i> <br><br>  Information about critical changes about all this can be obtained using email, SMS, phone call, Skype, Hangouts, Messanger, Telegram.  And this is all set up in 5 minutes at the airport while waiting for boarding the plane. <br><br>  We will be happy to help save nerves and healthy sleep, and if there are additional requests - we are always happy. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/358818/">https://habr.com/ru/post/358818/</a></p>
