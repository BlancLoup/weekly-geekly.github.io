  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Megaphone Recognizes Apple's Iphone Marriage</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This story began a long time ago.  One of my co-workers, in October 2008, bought an iphone in the Megafon sales office.  He liked the device and he used it for its intended purpose, forgot to add that he bought a white model (here you can attach a photo and add some information like: Then these models just went on sale in Russia, they were not cheap (25.500r for 16g model), and also demanded a binding agreement with Megaphone).  This device was very good and the comrade did not just rejoice and he liked everything.  But as in any business there are pitfalls this device gave him an unpleasant surprise.  As it turned out later, because of the temperature drops, the paintwork part of the iPhone cracks at the joints, and if dust gets in there, the cracks become very noticeable (owners of white iPhones will understand me).  In January 2009, my friend carried him to the branch of Megaphone for a refund.  The device was taken away, and after 2 weeks they gave away a new one without flaws, since they saw their flaws in these cracks.  A comrade was satisfied with this outcome of events, several months passed and in August 2009 the problem repeated, with one in one (the same cracks in the same place).  A colleague realized that this would happen to all white iPhones and decided to demand the return of the full cost of the phone.  I wrote a claim to which I was refused.  The refusal to issue the cost of the phone was argued by the fact that this is not a technical malfunction and that Megafon is not responsible for such problems.  Moreover, the speech was no longer even about replacing the phone.  and the matter could now be resolved only through legislation.  In October 2009, the case went to court. <br><br>  The decision of the court under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The court accepted the case, the representatives of the megaphone did not agree with the claim and refused to pay the money.  The court ordered an examination, which established that the defect is a factory marriage.  A colleague asked to return to him the cost of the device (25500r), the cost of examination (7000r), moral damage (2500r).  Megaphone went to the world with the payment of the cost of the device + the cost of examination + moral damage in the amount of 500 rubles.  This was the end of the trial.
