Spend a minute.  Closing my eyes, I sat and listened as the world around me was rapidly shrinking.  He was already dead, but he did not understand it yet.  And only individual sparks in it, as in a cooled fire, shone those who were in no hurry. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  14 minutes <br><br>  - Atomic alarm!  - the ever-silent speakers roared from the lampposts.  - Atomic alarm!  This is not a teaching!  Attention!  Immediately hide in the nearest shelters! <br>  He shuddered because he was standing under a mouthpiece.  I looked around in bewilderment, already unnecessary movement covering the bouquet from the wind.  And then he saw her - she ran from the bus stop, stumbling, waving her purse.  Without taking his eyes off his face.  He watched her, and all the other pedestrians seemed angular cardboard silhouettes covered in ashes. <br>  - Lord ... How now?  She said, grabbing his arm. <br>  “Take the flowers,” he said. <br>  - Crazy?  Which flowers?  She cried. <br>  “Take it,” he said, “and walk away, or they will trample it.”  Let's go better in the alley, walk.  Just have time to reach our beloved tree. <br>  She suddenly calmed down. <br>  - promise? <br>  “Of course,” he smiled, feeling how everything inside was chilling with fear.

      13 minutes <br><br>  He shot three times and saw the headmaster collapse in a chair, twitching a broken doll and splashing blood — hissing like a siphon. <br>  “Nothing personal,” he muttered under his breath, “just business ...” <br>  He aimed at the secretary, who was standing at the door of the office on bending legs, but changed his mind.  Coming closer, the killer carefully pulled the leather folder from under her arm. <br>  - Run, - advised gently.  He immediately noticed that he accidentally soiled the leg of black jeans with dust, patted it with his hand. <br>  - Run, really.  Maybe you will have time, - advised again and went out. <br><br>  12 minutes <br><br>  The old man sat motionless and looked at the chessboard, where his black king was huddled in a corner, under the protection of the last pieces.  His opponent, if it could be called an old chess partner, just leaned back, wheezed and fell from a folding stool, scratching his jacket in front of his heart with his hands.  They met here, on Passion Boulevard, every Friday — for thirty years now.  Good time. <br>  The old man looked around.  Somewhere there were beeps, the ringing of glasses and the rattle of thrashing machines.  He watched with a strange couple - a man with a sharp thin face and his companion, holding a bouquet of flowers to him.  The man hugged the girl by the shoulders.  Their eyes slid over the old man without noticing. <br>  He glanced at the board, then, coughing, stretched out his thin hand and gently laid the king on the black cell with cold fingers. <br><br>  11 minutes <br><br>  - Interestingly, and if I leave now without paying - will you arrest me?  - Sergey turned the gold signet in his fingers, then looked at the saleswoman behind the showcase of the jewelry salon.  She did not hear him - she stood with a white face, and with shaking hands infinitely straightened and straightened the pendant on her neck.  “Mom, ma-aaa, enough, well enough!”, - the second girl squealed in the corner, but the sirens drowned out her voice.  The guard looked at Sergei blankly, then suddenly pulled away, ran up to the screaming saleswoman, and hit her hard twice in the face. <br>  - Go away, bitch! <br>  - Not good, countryman, - smiling, Sergey loudly told him.  He put the signet on his finger and put his hand in the pocket of an expensive coat. <br>  - Che?  - shouted the guard, moving at him.  Sergey saw sweat drops on his forehead, and stared at them for a second, thinking that the signet was sitting on the finger as it should - it didn’t shake and dangle.  Then he took a pistol from his pocket and shot the guard in the face. <br><br>  10 minutes <br><br>  They sat in a stopped tram and passed each other a bottle of brandy. <br>  “It turned out badly,” said Andrei.  He tried to smile, but his lower jaw jumped, and his face turned white with every sip, - so reluctant to die. <br>  - Maybe all the same exercises? .. - Dimka objected, but he stopped right there. <br>  - It is a pity that they did not get to Pasha.  He is now just all gathered.  Birthday, probably a pillar of smoke ... <br>  - You think it would be easier? <br>  Andrew thought. <br>  “No,” he said.  - Not easier.  Okay, let's take another throat.  Have a snack, the cake is still not reach. <br>  He looked out the window. <br>  - Look, people live. <br>  At the crossroads a tall man in a coat shot a black jeep.  Each time he aimed carefully and for a long time - it seemed he really wanted to knock off the antenna, but he could not do it.  Having shot the cartridges, he waved his hand and leaned on the hood. <br>  - We arrived, - Dimka smiled.  He took a sip of brandy and grimaced. <br><br>  9 minutes <br><br>  “I have long wanted to tell you ...” he finished clicking the remote control, from one channel sizzling with an empty screen to another, and left the TV in peace. <br>  - What?  - she sluggishly responded. <br>  - Never loved you.  You should have drowned you in Crimea yet.  Would have thought that an accident. <br>  - Bastard!  - she hit him on the cheek.  Catching his hand, he abruptly twisted it.  When the wife squealed and bent from the pain, drove her to the open balcony, arching her elbow more. <br>  - Do not!  - she tried to cling with long nails to the door jamb.  The nail broke and remained stuck in the gap. <br>  He threw it from the balcony, barely restraining himself at the railing.  I looked at how the body flopped on the asphalt - the sound was not audible, everyone blocked the sirens. <br>  Smoked.  For ten years I did not feel the taste of cigarette smoke, because my wife wanted it that way.  He exhaled, inhaled deeper. <br><br>  8 minutes <br><br>  People ran down the street - in different directions, who where.  They ran across each other, fell, screamed and cursed.  The beggar alone sat quietly by the fence, wrapped in a tattered cloak.  The cap, in which some trifle strummed, had long been stumbled to the other side of the pavement, but he was in no hurry to follow it.  He quivered, lowering his unkempt head. <br>  “On you,” someone threw a pistol with the bolt pulled back to the beggar’s knees, “I'm kind today.”  One cartridge is still there like.  You'll figure it out. <br>  The beggar did not look up, with his eyes half-eyed, he wore his legs in black jeans, a smear of dust on his trouser leg.  I brushed the gun on the asphalt, howled softly, swaying from side to side.  Nearby, cautiously glancing with a brilliant gaze, a dove sank, pecking some kind of crumb. <br><br>  7 minutes <br><br>  In the cinema, someone was killed, the crowd kicked a body tossing and twirling around, and carrying a broken face across the floor. <br>  - Do not look, - he gently took her chin, turned to himself, kissed her lips. <br>  “I don’t look,” she bravely shrugged, although it was obvious that she was scared. <br>  “I will not leave you,” he said softly. <br>  - What?  - the girl didn’t hear, she covered her ears, cried out loudly: <br>  - How these sirens are fed up!  I can't hear you at all! <br>  - And do not listen!  He shouted back.  “I won't let you go anyway!” <br>  - True? <br>  - Of course! <br>  A few seconds later, they were shot by a beggar, overgrown with dirty bristles, who had a gun from somewhere.  In the cage there were only two bullets, and the beggar was not enough to shoot himself. <br>  - Critters!  So that you are dead!  - he shouted for a long time, but no one listened to him, only two guys in an empty tram nearby, ate the cake with their hands. <br><br>  6 minutes <br><br>  “You did everything so quickly,” he said, “thanks, Masha ... And these sirens are almost unheard of.” <br>  “Shut up,” a tall woman told the man in bed, “you can't talk.” <br>  “Now what's the point?”  - he laughed hoarsely, he coughed.  - Wonderful you, Masha.  So we will obey the doctors? <br>  She carefully tucked the blanket to him, she sat next to her, looking at the sharp profile in the twilight of the room. <br>  “Masha,” he stirred the words, raised his head, “read something?” <br>  - Do you want Brodsky?  She asked, not moving. <br>  - Highly. <br>  She didn't have to reach for the book and turn on the light.  Barely moving her lips, almost silently, she began: <br><br>  - I'm not that crazy, but tired over the summer. <br>  Over the shirt into the chest come on, and the day is lost. <br>  Hurry, or something, the winter came and brought it all - <br>  cities, humans, but for the beginning the greens ... <br><br>  5 minutes <br><br>  - Mom, do we have to sit here for a long time?  - asked from the depths of silently breathing carriage a children's voice. <br>  - Quiet.  How many will say, so much and we will sit, - the woman squealed.  And again everyone calmed down, only the crowd breathed - like one mortally wounded man. <br>  - Let's go to the platform?  - asked the driver of his mate. <br>  - What for?  At least in the cockpit.  And now there is a solid hysteria, especially when the escalators are turned off. <br>  The driver listened. <br>  “It seems quiet,” he shrugged. <br>  - This is for now.  Wait a bit more. <br>  - Yes, soon it will be all the same, you know.  We are on the roundabout.  Here everything will fill up. <br>  - That's for sure. <br>  Without saying a word, both lit up. <br>  “I feel like a pilot,” said the mate.  - As if the plane falls, and already a little bit left.  Only for a smoke. <br>  “The plane, the metro is the same, only without wings,” the engineer tried to joke. <br>  Both laughed sadly.  Then the changer flicked the switch and the train lights went out. <br><br>  4 minutes <br><br>  Around the corner, someone was playing the guitar, the discordant chorus diligently pulled out the words of the song.  Sasha climbed the dark stairs to the top floor of the house.  At first it seemed to him that there was no one on the landing, but then he heard a quiet cry at the door, upholstered in red leatherette. <br>  - Well?  What roars?  - Sasha squatted in front of a little girl in a red jumpsuit. <br>  “Scary ...” she said, looking at him with gray eyes.  - My mother does not open the door.  She and papa swore strongly, and then fell silent, I heard through the door. <br>  - Silent - this is bad, - seriously said Sasha.  - Listen, you want to the roof?  From above, everything is visible far, far away. <br>  “It’s impossible to get on the roof,” the girl shook her head, crying, her face crying in her hands.  Sasha gently pulled his hands from his face, winked at his gray eyes. <br>  - Today you can.  I'm not someone else's uncle, and your neighbor below.  That is honestly honest.  Come and see for yourself. <br>  Rumbling with sheets of iron, they climbed to the very top of the roof.  Sasha firmly held the girl by the hand. <br>  - Yeah.  So we came, - he looked around, then took off his raincoat and laid it on the rusty tin, - sit down.  Good visibility? <br>  - Yes, - the girl, without looking up, looked at the sky. <br>  - So that's great.  We'll sit, and then mom will return, and dad ... <br>  Sasha stretched out beside him, his hands behind his head, and also began to look at the clouds, wondering to himself whether he would have time to notice the rocket. <br><br>  3 minutes <br><br>  The city calmed down.  I was sitting on a bench, still not opening my eyes, feeling how people were huddled deeper into the cracks to hide, although it was useless to hide.  Those lucky enough to survive were far away.  And I was not considered, I did not even cast a shadow, sitting under a dim lantern. <br><br>  Two minutes. <br><br>  The wind stopped blowing.  Time was shrinking, rapidly twisting into a ball, because millions of people now thought only about one thing - how to slow down these minutes.  Never the way everyone wants.  Slow and unhurried, they were on an equal footing, although the first ones had a few extra moments in stock. <br><br>  Minute. <br><br>  In the sky like someone drew a white strip.  It all lengthened, and in front of it glowed hot spot - like a meteorite, which is now falling, leaving behind just a small funnel.  “Little!  - I begged, without opening my lips.  - You are welcome!  Little!  And so that all would return, leave, take out the garbage, again become like before! ” <br>  There was silence in the world, and I realized that no one was listening to me.  Soon this city will turn into a glass bubble, frozen, forever melted into the crust of the earth. <br><br>  <em>I found these works on my network at work, who was the primary source of this text - I don’t know, but it’s curious to read ...</em> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/19039/">https://habr.com/ru/post/19039/</a></p>
