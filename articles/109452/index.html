  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Business Informatics</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello, dear habrasoobschestvu! <br>  In essence, with my article, I want to decide, to some extent, the future of our youth, and more specifically, the author of this article claims to be a teacher of computer science and programming at Mr. University.  Everything would be quite simple, but the specificity of teaching makes you look at this task from the other side.  Namely, the problem is that the faculty at which to be taught is economic, with a specialty "Business Informatics".  Since there is no such specialty in St. Petersburg yet, the program itself does not exist either. <br>  Thus, your obedient servant has a task: to make a plan of teaching for 8 lectures, respectively 16 training hours, during which a person without desire (the majority of students) received at least some residual knowledge and concepts on the subject of programming. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/090/58c/c92/09058cc925561f8526554150f1535e3b.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Communicating with the leadership of my university, I was given to understand that downloading ‚Äúunfortunate children‚Äù with profound knowledge of programming is absolutely not required.  And what is required, I was never told.  From this I concluded that the teaching program should be based on the fact that most students are afraid of computer mice as living system units like atomic reactors, and the process of writing programs, in their thinking, comes down to a black screen and jumping in it incomprehensible characters (a scene from the matrix comes to mind). <br>  To begin with, it seems to me, it is worth making them understand that programming surrounds them everywhere, starting from alarm clocks and metro cards, from which many of them start the morning, ending with mobile phones.  It is also worth pointing out that programming is carried out not only on computers, but also in the person‚Äôs head (it is possible to make a lyrical digression on NLP tepu).  After students realize that programming is not the privilege of bearded men in stretched sweaters, it is worthwhile to introduce the concept of pseudo-code and explain to them the basics of building programs: following, branching, repeating.  After that, you can safely give them the task of building an algorithm for any action based on known facts. <br>  Further down the list, you can enter the concept of programming languages, which are a formal system of characters, for recording programs.  The concept of syntax and semantics of the language does not hurt right there.  In my opinion, the definition of variables, what types they are, what actions with them can be performed will quite harmoniously be included in the same pair.  You should start with the simplest variables, and gradually move to structures and objects, and then define the concept of functions and properties. <br>  Based on the knowledge gained earlier, you can begin to talk about the software itself.  Its classification is possible architecture. <br>  At this point in the development of the program, I am a bit stalled, as further development involves evasion in one direction or another.  And the "unfortunate kids" is absolutely not necessary.  And the task before me is to either develop all of the above described more deeply and gradually, or score on the requirements of the dean's office and independently determine the direction of development. <br>  Here, it would be interesting for me to hear the opinion of the habrasoobshchestvo, which should not be indifferent to the future of our children).  What knowledge do you think a second-year undergraduate student with a specialty in business informatics should have in order for you to take him as an apprentice and continue his education on the basis of the available basis? </div>
