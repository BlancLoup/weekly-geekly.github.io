I read the ‚ÄúBook for Heroes‚Äù - I didn‚Äôt like it, the book seemed somehow fanciful to the gurism of the author.  And so I myself and lived on.  Then I stumbled upon a good review of the audio recording of the ‚ÄúOffice of Machiavelli‚Äù seminar.  I downloaded (I understand what I stole - I repent, I hope to refund the author's fee) - I listened, and I was delighted: many of the most fundamental things, as they say "in life," I rediscovered myself.  It was akin to some kind of growing up, sort of like eating a pill - and becoming an adult :)

      Joke, in fact, it gave a completely different view of the world, more precisely it gave a social and technological view of the world.  Because it was here that I had a big gap.  It's like that you suddenly emerged in a completely different world, I realized that I had not seen a significant, immensely important aspect of life.  I saw the inadequacy of my picture of the world, I really hope that thanks to this my picture of the world has become more adequate.  I began to see those "little things in life" that have an incredible impact on life (not without reason at the beginning of this article there was such a picture - after all, even a nail lying on the road regulates the movement of cars). <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cd7/b5f/10a/cd7b5f10ade796bf2634f38b882b7cbd.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Management fights </h4><br><br>  Of course, when I was reading Tarasov‚Äôs books, I really wanted to try what it was - <a href="http://www.poedinki.ru/skill/duel">Management fights</a> .  But they passed only Russia and Belarus, they were not conducted in Ukraine.  And now, from Facebook, I suddenly find out that they began to be held in Kiev.  Decided to go try. <br><br>  I didn‚Äôt want to play as a player right away, as I thought it was better for me to watch, but they reassured me and said that they were training duels.  Since I have been working as a hired manager for the past 10 years, I immediately volunteered to be on the board of employees. <br><br>  Finally, everything that I read about could be tracked and analyzed in practice.  For example, only after a duel, I am not in theory, but what is called ‚Äúskin‚Äù realized that there can be no clear victory or pure defeat, there is always something that will ‚Äúspoil‚Äù the picture - in my case, hired workers voted against me.  Pure victories are probably available to the masters.  This is one of the main "discoveries" of that evening, it is not counting the minor ones, but the most important thing is the layout of all the theoretical management puzzle puzzles that have been piled in my head.  This is so far for me one of the best intellectual pastimes (and I think that all sorts of Mafias nervously smoke on the sidelines).  God bless the health of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/managesfight">organizers</a> .  It was unforgettable (cooler than a date with a girl :), it sounds pathetic, but it is so. <br><br>  Particularly interesting is the ‚Äúmafia effect‚Äù, as I call it.  That is - there are 3 boards of judges: those who are hired for work, send to negotiate and trust property.  And this is right, because no one will be able to sit on all the chairs at once.  And when the judges evaluate, and you listen and feel yourself in a kaleidoscope of roles: here you were one, and now you listen to how you would assess the situation in another role (often the opposite position).  And this is called - to consider the situation from different points of view. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d63/099/9f6/d630999f6073500a546a05612b0db6bb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  One can ‚Äúpump the brain‚Äù as much as possible, defeat competitors at the meta level, read books (this is useful, no one argues), but until you get into the car and test all your skills offline, you are a theoretical driver.  You still need to go over the rubicon of practice.  And managerial fights are wonderful, and, most importantly, an eco-friendly reason to do it (it is better to stuff bumps in training than in a real fight). <br><br>  Yes, we can say that the whole life is training, but where else will they give you to be in the role of a top millionaire manager?  Or as your leader?  Like, say, hear, let the chief steer one day !?  Of course - in real life it is almost impossible.  Here, thanks to the game situation, it is possible, without consequences, and without large resources, to try oneself in a variety of roles.  There is a place for a social and technological experiment, for honing social engineering tools, without which the work of a manager, a negotiator, and even an employee is unthinkable, yes, even hired workers manage their leader (when they work well or poorly, or when they strike) .  After all, even a nail lying on the road regulates the movement of cars. <br><br>  <b>Management fights are something like a scientific research institute or a social laboratory, after a workshop in which you understand social mechanics better, you begin to better feel the social space around you, better see those invisible threads that entangle our lives</b> even after our death, even after our death there is a struggle: tell me, what testament did the deceased write, this or that? <br><br>  One thing is for sure: after the managerial fights, the picture of the world (and with it the possibilities) widens considerably.  You start to see managerial moves everywhere: in films, on the market bargaining with the seller, in advertising, in a conversation with a friend, in the speeches of deputies on TV, in fairy tales that you read to children for the night - everywhere. <br><br>  Although the situation is gaming, but the results are not at all game, but very much even vital. <br><br><h4>  So, why do I go to fights, than they are useful: </h4><br><br>  - Negotiation skills (now there are many negotiation techniques / exercises / trainings, but here the negotiation technique is trained in a complex situation - after all, winning negotiations is not an end in itself, negotiations can be won, but the situation can be overwhelmed - it seems like winning a battle, but losing the war. Therefore, the negotiator is evaluated whether he ‚Äúsettled‚Äù the situation and not ‚Äúcrushed‚Äù the counterparty in the negotiations). <br><br>  - Ownership management skills (it helps to know how the owner / investor sees the situation, because if a hired manager does not increase his property, then the price is worthless. Often, because of the owner‚Äôs remoteness, the owner forgets what they are meant to do - increase the property, and not revel in their power). <br><br>  - skills for evaluating future employers (whether the manager wants or not, but his management style will still be visible to employees even at the interview level, and if your potential very valuable employee sees the manager‚Äôs not completely human attitude to himself - with the loss of a valuable employee, the manager will lose everything: gain values ‚Äã‚Äãof the company, an increase in the property of the investor, your career. As an employee you can immediately train the vision of good employers: in any game situation, it will be immediately obvious: will it deceive you?  Do children promote professional growth? etc.) <br><br>  - the ability to correctly enter the necessary information and skillfully operate with input data (input is like a weapon, like a ‚ÄúKalashnikov assault rifle‚Äù - but there‚Äôs no sense in it if you a) don‚Äôt know how to use it, b) didn‚Äôt skillfully use it in an inappropriate situation , c) chose the wrong weapon while negotiating) <br><br>  - the practice of solving managerial tasks (no matter how the situation turns, the skill of not falling into a stupor from different circumstances is always useful) <br><br>  - skills of seeing the moves of the opponent and scenarios of the development of the situation not 1 turn ahead <br>  (it helps to start thinking strategically, in order not to fall into the managerial fog, to acquire a kind of internal GPS targets, which no interference of others, circumstances, etc. can bring down) <br><br>  <b>- the most important thing: an integrated approach, where all of the above is trained at once.</b> <br><br>  After all, in life all these elements and even more sometimes combine into such a cocktail that you understand - it is better to own a recipe to keep control of what you can keep.  This is how to expand this sphere of solidity in your life, of what you can rely on and help Management fights. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">For those interested</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <a href="http://on.fb.me/1gcd4MK">Managerial fights in Kiev</a> </div></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/205078/">https://habr.com/ru/post/205078/</a></p>
