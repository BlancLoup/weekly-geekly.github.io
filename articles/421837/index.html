It was impossible to make a demo in the form in which I would like to see it, for this very limited period of time. <br><br>  However, I could not give up and not do anything.  And then I remembered that I had long wanted to take part in the <strong>ZX-Spectrum</strong> demo contests.  And so, as for the last year I had as many as two <strong>48k</strong> real, I could get some pleasure from creating a demo.  By the way - for me the most important thing in writing a demo is testing for real, <em>emulsifiers</em> do not give such pleasure from the process, this is a very wonderful feeling when after another change in the code you upload a demo to real, and see how the real piece of paper shuffles bytes in memory rendering effect.

      Since I only have <strong>48k</strong> from the reals, I decided to make a demo for <strong>48k</strong> .  And due to the limited timeframe and the absence of any developments, the choice fell on the creation of <strong>1k intro</strong> (a demo of only 1 kilobyte, or 1024 bytes). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Last time <strong>z80 asm</strong> I poked in <strong>EmuZWin</strong> - a great emulator with built-in assembler.  But unfortunately <strong>EmuZWin</strong> on anything above <strong>Windows XP</strong> does not work, or is buggy. <br>  Having considered various options, he stopped at a bunch of <strong>Unreal + sjAsm + Notepad ++</strong> programs, which, in my opinion, are much <strong>less comfortable</strong> for <strong>EmuZWin</strong> , but unlike him, they are still alive. <br><br>  During the writing of this intro, I conducted, directly in the source code, a development log, based on which the following text was written: <br><br><h5>  Hello World! </h5><br>  What should I write first, having almost zero experience in <strong>z80 asm</strong> ?  That's right, sprite output of 5x5 familiarity or 40x40 pixels for one of the effects (ironically, later, in order to climb into 1k this unfinished part was thrown out of the intro). <br><br>  Amazingly, it was quite simple to do it from scratch, using a pre-generated label of row addresses using <a href="http://speccy.info/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582_%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0_%25D1%2581%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D1%2583%25D1%258E%25D1%2589%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8_%25D1%258D%25D0%25BA%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0">Down HL</a> . <br><br>  Oh, index registers, which ones are convenient, but which are slow, they literally survive ticks.  I had to throw their use out of the pile of places. <br><br>  Still here, at the very beginning, I came across the incredible glitches of <strong>sjAsm</strong> , or rather its latest version.  Dizasm in <strong>Unreal</strong> showed absolutely crazy sequence of commands.  I downloaded the penultimate version - it was already possible to live with it somehow. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xh/yh/ot/xhyhotktsbfmg1iqk_gtrbmsvjy.png"><br><br>  It is clear that a sufficient amount of pre-drawn sprites in 1k is not thrust, so I decided to generate them dynamically.  And not anyhow how, and to draw with the help of polygons. <br><br>  Therefore, the second procedure, which I wrote, was the procedure for drawing a triangle.  For the most part, it was porting my own code written in <strong>C.</strong>  With the only global difference from the <strong>C</strong> version, the scanners of the polygon are first generated, and only then are they drawn on these scanlines. <br><br>  After high-level languages, you get a certain pleasure from <strong>jr aka goto</strong> : <br><br><pre><code class="hljs css"><span

that it took me at a reasonable time to write a working <strong>draw_triangle</strong> on <strong>z80 asm</strong> , drawing a pixel polygon per pixel and no holes when joining polygons. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tl/sv/or/tlsvorwso0wpqcrulnaewu23_84.png"><br>  <em>Hello triangles!</em> <br><br><h5>  Particles </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ng/kx/mq/ngkxmqez4envpqx6-tzzc0wd2ge.png"><br><br>  Due to the presence of a generator of the table screen rows, I wrote a pretty curved and slow point output procedure using this table.  The procedure has two entry points - just pixel inversion, and pixel inversion with painting it <strong>INK</strong> -a + <strong>BRIGHT</strong> + and the color specified in one of the registers. <br><br>  At the stage of creating the effect with particles, I discovered that the example with the structures from the examples in <strong>wiki sjAsm</strong> just does not work.  Googling was brought up on the topic from the site <strong>zx-pk.ru</strong> , where this problem is described, and there is no solution to it - ha, great - another glitch. <br><br>  I decided to do everything clearly - updating the coordinates regardless of the drawing, by interruption.  Aha ... plus dohren bytes to generate an interrupt table. <br><br>  There were few particles at this stage, and they barely fit into the frame - this is to the word about the slowness of my procedure for outputting the point%) But using the common table with sprites did not allow me to throw it out, and take it ready, because  this greatly saved space on the need for only one table generator.  Yes, and my love for bikes too :) <br><br>  Too few particles ... increased their number, but now the drawing has grown fat to two frames. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tb/eu/qq/tbeuqqaoeef05uf04tfe33-t7f4.jpeg"><br>  <em>Testing for <strong>Peters WS64</strong> , which I got on the past cc and repaired this winter :)</em> <br><br>  By the way, already at this stage the points turned into fat horizontal points <strong>2: 1</strong> , as on the <strong>Commodore 64</strong> .  This happened because of the initially small number of particles, and my dissatisfaction with the fact that they were quite invisible when running on real.  Solved the problem by replacing the plate <br><br><pre> <code class="hljs nginx"><span class="hljs-attribute"><span class="hljs-attribute">db</span></span> <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">128</span></span>,<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">64</span></span>,<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">32</span></span>,<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">16</span></span>,<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">8</span></span>,<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">4</span></span>,<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">2</span></span>,<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span>;</code> </pre> <br>  on <br><br><pre> <code class="hljs nginx"><span class="hljs-attribute"><span class="hljs-attribute">db</span></span> <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">192</span></span>,<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">192</span></span>,<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">96</span></span>,<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">24</span></span>,<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">12</span></span>,<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">6</span></span>,<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">3</span></span>,<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">3</span></span>;</code> </pre> <br>  which worsened the accuracy of positioning and made the flight a bit jerky, but increased visibility.  Here, the fact that the particles fell from top to bottom also played into the hands - their vision was smeared on the vertical. <br><br>  By the way, particles each fall with their own random speed, and two bytes are used to store the <strong>Y</strong> coordinates. <br><br><h5>  Sprites </h5><br>  I threw out the unfinished piece of the part with the sprites, realizing that I did not fit in <strong>1k</strong> with him. <br><br>  In addition, there was already a shortage of space, so I remembered the wonderful <a href="http://hypr.ru/blog/dev/740.html">article</a> about <a href="http://hypr.ru/blog/dev/740.html">Introspek</a> about packers, chose <strong>zx7</strong> as a packer, which resulted in savings of about 110 bytes.  By the way, maybe someone knows a more suitable packer for the 1k intro? <br><br><h5>  Chaos Constructions </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/83/xj/h4/83xjh4wggmay449rwrmrfphx62y.png"><br><br>  Since I already had a procedure for displaying a polygon, it seemed to me a cool idea to break the <strong>cc</strong> logo into polygons and display them one after another. <br><br>  I wrote some test code that outputs several polygons - everything worked as I planned - great. <br><br>  To check whether or not my idea would fit in <strong>1k</strong> , I generated a certain number of random polygons, according to estimates, a sufficient number for the logo, and drove it into the source.  Compiled, and made sure that - excellent - intro, in this form, breaks the limit of 1024 bytes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fq/8k/bc/fq8kbcfvtdbdirtysojcd0hix8m.jpeg"><br>  <em>Life photo, recognize the device on the table?</em>  <em>:)))</em> <br><br>  I decided once again to test the semi-finished intro, already with polygons, and a packer, uploaded to real and ... got a reset.  First of all, I began to sin on the fact that I forgot to initialize the memory somewhere, from which, where on the emulator <strong>0x00</strong> and everything works fine, on the real world there is garbage that causes a reset. <br><br>  Nothing better for finding a problem place than the half-division method and <strong>di halt</strong> I could not think of. <br><br>  Carry with a reset on real life for two hours, there was no way to localize the glitch ... <br>  As it turned out, the matter was not in my code, it was in the included sound <em>enhancer</em> on the phone from which I loaded the <strong>WAV</strong> .  Improvers from the bit stream in the <strong>WAV</strong> file generated the delusion stream. <br><br>  As soon as I turned it off, everything magically worked. <br><br>  He outlined the logo in the graphics editor <a href="https://vk.com/errorsoft%3Fw%3Dwall-101502595_150%252Fall">errorsoft greenpixel</a> , breaking it into a bunch of triangles, and manually drove the coordinates into the source.  Having shoved the <strong>Chaos Constructions</strong> logo completely and running it on real life - I was glad - it looked pretty good. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vy/4m/ul/vy4mul7kzdo_o7qav3wtnvc3oki.jpeg"><br>  <em>The first display of the logo on the real</em> <br><br>  However, I crammed too few random landfills, and on the real logo, there was an output of <strong>1k</strong> by 150 bytes.  And this is despite the fact that the particle effect was still not completed, and the transition between the parts was sharp. <br><br>  To go to sleep on this day, because of the fussing with glitches, it came out already at 8 am 8) <br><br>  And yes, I tried to optimize the size, keeping the coordinates and indexes of the vertices separately, but the packer didn‚Äôt like it much, which made the size only increase. <br><br><h5>  The final </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qv/h9/is/qvh9ist1fdq9xunbrd4uyejd3gi.png"><br><br>  I figured out how to diversify the output of the logo; for this, almost nothing was needed except two more plates of pixels: <br><br><pre> <code class="hljs">fake_points1: db 1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128; 1 ch fake_points2: db 32,8,128,2,16,1,64,4; 2 ch normal_points: db 128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1; 3 ch</code> </pre> <br>  What gave the cool effect of increasing the detail of the logo rendering, or the initial obscuration and a gradual increase in sharpness. <br><br>  And finally, I made the final version with all the transitions, while throwing out a lot of everything.  In the process, I found a glitch in the procedure of drawing a triangle - if the two vertices on <strong>Y have the</strong> same coordinates, then the triangle is drawn crookedly (it looks like division by 0 when calculating <strong>dx</strong> ), bypassed a temporary hack. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xo/a3/--/xoa3--9_kt2k-uodr2gabj8ithm.jpeg"><br>  <em>Testing the final version on Leningrad 48</em> <br><br><h5>  Size optimization </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-e/ro/l8/-erol8uszgdcler4i9jhp4n-9cu.jpeg"><br>  <em>Double digits are ‚Äúextra bytes‚Äù</em> <br><br><h6>  94 extra bytes ... </h6><br>  It is time to cut out the ‚Äúcultural‚Äù preservation / restoration of registers of the procedures for entering / exiting, it‚Äôs far from necessary, and the memory is eating. <br><br><h6>  86 bytes ... </h6><br>  Tested on real - works!

Therefore, for looping, after the end of the intro is <strong>ret</strong> , well, and then - another unpacking and transition to the unpacked code ... <br><br>  It was not possible to get rid of the last 48 bytes, I had to cut out the interrupt handler, but Hurray!  Shoved!  Even 1 extra byte remained. <br><br>  And since there are no interruptions, it is possible to score on the frame structure, and it is difficult to see the cross section of the beam on one pixel in the first effect, therefore, it increased the number of particles per eye, with a compromise between speed and entertainment. <br><br>  He even more stung, stupidly transferring code and data from one place to another, helping the packer.  What took some time :) <br><br>  This freed up about <strong>10 bytes</strong> , into which I thrust a parody of the sound.  KHK, KHE, sound is in some places, by ear inserted: <br><br><pre> <code class="hljs perl"> ifdef UseSound ld a,d <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">and</span></span> <span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">#10 out (#FE),a endif</span></span></code> </pre> <br>  I did not ‚Äúnail‚Äù the sound, but made a define, thus having received two versions of the intro, with and without sound.  In the one that without sound, in the "extra" bytes stuffed <br><br><pre> <code class="hljs nginx"><span class="hljs-attribute"><span class="hljs-attribute">db</span></span> <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'e'</span></span>,<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'r'</span></span>,<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'r'</span></span>,<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'o'</span></span>,<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'r'</span></span></code> </pre> <br>  I collected <strong>trd</strong> and <strong>tap</strong> , and uploaded it all to <strong>cc</strong> . <br><br>  Hooray - I participate in demopati! <br><br><h5>  Afterword </h5><br>  It was funny with the sound at all, someone on the puttlace spoke about ‚Äúclear sound‚Äù, someone looked at me strangely, and I found the following on the <strong>pouet</strong> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vt/p_/sw/vtp_swwrkskgpqbexsuj1nubn40.png"><br><br>  And this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/og/vh/wc/ogvhwc8p907emey1wk2erb-ejtm.png"><br><br>  In general, I didn‚Äôt understand whether someone liked a 10-byte sound or not :) <br><br>  And finally - it is a shame that the <strong>1k</strong> competition did not take place this year, in my opinion, the work turned out to be decent, but it is difficult to compete with <strong>640k</strong> , but I really wanted to fight. <br><br>  <strong>Write demos, write 1k!</strong> <br><br>  And here's what happened in the end (ps, take care of your ears): <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Q3cD3dx5lY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Version without sound: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2fwdWSiczIE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/421837/">https://habr.com/ru/post/421837/</a></p>
