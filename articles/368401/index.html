      Manufacturers of the following battery packs stated that they have a low level of self-discharge: Ansmann maxE, Duracell Duralock, Fujitsu HR-3UTC, Fujitsu HR-3UTHC, Panasonic BK-3MCCE, Panasonic BK-3HCCE, Varta Ready 2 Use. <br><br>  It is also stated that the following battery packs are frost resistant: Ansmann maxE, Ansmann 2850 mAh, Fujitsu HR-3UTC, Fujitsu HR-3UTHC, Panasonic BK-3MCCE and Panasonic BK-3HCCE.  In principle, all LSD Ni-MH (Low Self-Discharge) batteries should have a high frost resistance ratio.  As far as this is true, we will find out in one of the parts of this review. <br><br><h2>  <b>Battery Testing Technique:</b> </h2><br>  To test the batteries were assembled kits, consisting of four pieces.  In the first part of the study, the residual capacity of the batteries out of the box was measured without recharging them and after the capacity recovery process based on the Maha MH-C9000 battery charger.  For the battery in the first slot, the voltage was monitored using a UNI-T UT61E digital True RMS multimeter.  Based on the data obtained, the battery voltage was plotted against time for the process of discharging new batteries with a current of 500 mA and recovered batteries with currents of 500 and 1000 mA. <br><br>  In the second part of the study, battery resistance to negative temperatures was studied.  To do this, they were placed in the freezer for one hour and frozen to a temperature of -15 degrees Celsius.  Temperature control was carried out using a UNI-T UT303A pyrometer.  Batteries were frozen in the battery store of the Fujifilm FinePix S3 Pro camera, based on which further definition of performance. <br><br>  In the third part of testing, on the basis of two identical flashes of Yongnuo YN560-III, they compared the speed of their charge after a pulse at full power.  Simultaneous descent of flashes was made using the Yongnuo YN560-TX transmitter.  To eliminate the effect of any flash on the test results, during pair tests, batteries were tested in both flashes. <br><br>  Well, now let's move on to the main characters of this test. <br><br><h2>  <b>Ansmann maxE 2100 mAh</b> </h2><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/123/323/6c9/1233236c91614c54a4808fcc2675a1f8.jpg"><br><br>  The batteries are packaged in a transparent blister with a gray backing.  On sale you can find kits for two or four batteries.  I got two battery packs, so it took two blisters to complete the set. <br><br>  The batteries have a capacity of 2100 mAh and are manufactured using the maxE technology, due to which they have low self-discharge characteristics.  This also confirms the process of discharging new batteries with a current of 500 mA. <br><br>  The manufacturer declared the cold resistance of batteries.  The number of charge / discharge cycles is 1000 cycles. <br><br>  The graph of the discharge of the battery current of 500 mA and recovered by currents of 500 and 1000 mA. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/165/95d/01e/16595d01ed70404a81bffd651fa2b4a4.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <b>Ansmann 2850 mAh</b> </h2><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/725/c85/19b/725c8519b7764bd0a2ff27585a3f518b.jpg"><br><br>  Ansmann 2850 mAh batteries are packaged in a similar blister as the Ansmann maxE 2100 mAh.  Packages for two or four batteries are also available.  I again had to assemble a complete set of two sets. <br><br>  Batteries have a higher declared capacity of 2850 mAh.  These batteries are manufactured according to technology other than maxE, because of which they have a very high self-discharge.  This is evident from the test discharge of a new uncharged battery with a current of 500 mA.  After the start of the discharge process, the charger immediately issued information that the battery in the first slot is completely discharged.  The remaining batteries also had low residual capacity values. <br><br>  The manufacturer declared the cold resistance of batteries.  The number of charge / discharge cycles is 1000 cycles. <br><br>  The graph of the discharge of the battery current of 500 mA and recovered by currents of 500 and 1000 mA. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f10/381/6be/f103816be74c4c09bb886ce3993d4230.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <b>Duracell Duralock 2400 mAh</b> </h2><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/30d/9ba/6cc/30d9ba6cceff4f3da2b18a9cd2f5518b.jpg"><br><br>  Batteries are also packed in a plastic blister.  On sale you can find packaging for two and four batteries.  I needed two packs again to make a complete set. <br><br>  Batteries have a capacity of 2400 mAh.  The manufacturer claims that they have low self-discharge.  The results of the discharge of new batteries indicate their close residual capacity of all batteries, which confirms this statement. <br><br>  The stated number of charge / discharge cycles: 1000 cycles. <br><br>  The graph of the discharge of the battery current of 500 mA and recovered by currents of 500 and 1000 mA. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/197/b84/2cf/197b842cfdbb4a308ef2ef32ddbccfca.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <b>Fujitsu HR-3UTC 1900 mAh</b> </h2><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/971/54c/16a/97154c16abee4004bd3217347dc185b5.jpg"><br><br>  Fujitsu batteries are a completely new product on the market, which was put to the test at the last moment.  Batteries are packaged in a transparent white blister.  There are packs of two or four batteries.  This time I got a pack for four batteries. <br><br>  The manufacturer declared a minimum battery capacity of 1900 mAh.  These batteries have a low self-discharge, because they are produced using the well-proven LSD Ni-MH technology, developed by Sanyo and first used for Eneloop batteries. <br><br>  The manufacturer declared the cold resistance of batteries.  The number of charge / discharge cycles is 2100 cycles. <br><br>  The graph of the discharge of the battery current of 500 mA and recovered by currents of 500 and 1000 mA. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/457/ec8/af9/457ec8af971c4457984934145b37b26c.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <b>Fujitsu HR-3UTHC 2450 mAh</b> </h2><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3b6/742/5ee/3b67425eef75481d848aac1c90eba1bc.jpg"><br><br>  Another set of batteries from Fujitsu.  The batteries are packaged in a transparent blister with a dark gray backing.  Packages of two and four batteries are available.  I again got a pack for four batteries. <br><br>  The manufacturer declared a minimum battery capacity of 2450 mAh.  These batteries are manufactured using Eneloop technology and have a large capacity and low self-discharge. <br><br>  The manufacturer declared the cold resistance of batteries.  The number of charge / discharge cycles is 500 cycles. <br><br>  The graph of the discharge of a new battery current of 500 mA and recovered by currents of 500 and 1000 mA. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e90/3fb/c32/e903fbc328fb4bc88e8813047d1388ea.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <b>GP 210AAHC 2000 mAh</b> </h2><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/70b/d98/869/70bd9886931b45f68d73499d4465dba3.jpg"><br><br>  The batteries are packaged in a transparent blister with a backing in yellow-green colors.  On sale you can find packaging for two and four batteries. <br><br>  The number 2100, applied to the half of the battery case, does not at all indicate its capacity, but the name of the series.  The minimum battery capacity is stated in 2000 mAh. <br><br>  The manufacturer claims the use of new production technology and low self-discharge of batteries.  But this statement differs from the test results of new batteries, when the difference of their residual capacity inside the kit is 30-35%. <br><br>  The number of charge / discharge cycles is 500 cycles. <br><br>  The graph of the discharge of a new battery current of 500 mA and recovered by currents of 500 and 1000 mA. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/484/26a/a45/48426aa452b845b3a0b3f0ef41b78dfb.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <b>GP 250AAHC 2450 mAh</b> </h2><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/368/fa1/edc/368fa1edc7a849eda1a8bdc92a7f80c1.jpg"><br><br>  Batteries are packed in a blister similar to GP 210AAHC batteries.  Packages for two and four batteries are also available. <br><br>  The inscription 2500 again means only that the battery belongs to this series.  When the declared minimum capacity is 2450 mAh. <br><br>  The manufacturer reassures us about the application of technology Low Self-Discharge (low self-discharge).  However, the results of the discharge of new batteries with a current of 500 mA.  The maximum value of the residual capacity inside the kit is 437 mAh, and the minimum is 34 mAh.  This indicates the impossibility of using out-of-box batteries and high self-discharge of batteries. <br><br>  The number of charge / discharge cycles is 500 cycles. <br><br>  The graph of the discharge of a new battery current of 500 mA and recovered by currents of 500 and 1000 mA. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4fb/c1e/850/4fbc1e85000f48998b4cfc78a97cc386.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <b>Panasonic BK-3MCCE 1900 mAh</b> </h2><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0f5/207/234/0f5207234cf74517960e14fb8c21f55d.jpg"><br><br>  The batteries are packaged in a transparent blister with a blue-blue backing.  Packages for two, four and even eight batteries are available. <br><br>  The manufacturer declared a minimum battery capacity of 1900 mAh.  Batteries are manufactured using the same Eneloop technology, thanks to which they have a low level of self-discharge.  This is the fourth generation of batteries of this series, in which the number of charge / discharge cycles has been increased from 1,800 to 2,100 cycles. <br><br>  The manufacturer declared the cold resistance of batteries.

On sale there are packaging for two and four batteries.  I again got a blister on four batteries. <br><br>  The manufacturer declared a minimum battery capacity of 2450 mAh.  These batteries, like Fujitsu HR-3UTHC, are manufactured using Eneloop Pro technology and have low self-discharge and high capacity compared to Fujitsu HR-3UTC and Panasonic BK-3MCCE. <br><br>  The manufacturer declared the cold resistance of batteries.  The number of charge / discharge cycles is 500 cycles. <br><br>  The graph of the discharge of a new battery current of 500 mA and recovered by currents of 500 and 1000 mA. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/812/7c5/5c2/8127c55c26dd49ec904b9c0a69c887a4.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <b>Varta Ready 2 Use 2100 mAh</b> </h2><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/987/528/eb9/987528eb9f874c6793bf9e48d97cae07.jpg"><br><br>  Varta Ready 2 Use batteries, like all previous battery models, are packed in a transparent blister.  On sale you can find packaging for two batteries, and four. <br><br>  Batteries have a capacity of 2100 mAh.  The manufacturer claims a low level of self-discharge of batteries.  This, in principle, is confirmed by tests of new batteries for discharge with a current of 500 mA. <br><br>  The number of charge / discharge cycles is 1000 cycles. <br><br>  The graph of the discharge of a new battery current of 500 mA and recovered by currents of 500 and 1000 mA. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/196/4a8/609/1964a8609fc84df0b4fbe68f70bf1e07.jpg"><br><br><hr><br>  To analyze the data, I divided the batteries into two groups.  The first is batteries with a capacity of about 2000 mAh, the second with a capacity of about 2500 mAh. <br><br>  <b>The schedule of discharge of new batteries with a capacity of about 2000 mAh with a current of 500 mA</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9ef/4ae/63f/9ef4ae63f7244e2d83861cae17d8a79e.jpg"><br><br>  The measured residual capacity of batteries allows them to be divided into two groups.  Ansmann maxE 2100 mAh, Fujitsu HR-3UTC 1900 mAh, Panasonic BK-3MCCE 1900 mAh and Varta Ready 2 Use 2100 mAh showed very similar results.  Equal battery capacity inside the kit confirms that these batteries have a low self-discharge. <br><br>  GP 210AAHC 2000 mAh kit was the worst in this test.  Moreover, the battery capacity was lower than its competitors by about 150 mAh, but also the variation of capacity inside the kit was almost 300 mAh. <br><br>  <b>Discharge graph of recovered batteries with a capacity of about 2000 mAh with a current of 500 mA</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/653/9f5/44c/6539f544cc9742efb954e130a8a84348.jpg"><br><br>  In this test, the Ansmann maxE 2100 mAh kit becomes the clear leader.  The battery discharge confirmed the passport capacity of 2100 mAh. <br><br>  The following is a group of GP 210AAHC 2000 mAh, Panasonic BK-3MCCE 1900 mAh and Varta Ready 2 Use 2100 mAh.  Their results are about 2000 mAh. <br><br>  Well, and closes the test results kit Fujitsu HR-3UTC 1900 mAh.  Despite the last place, the battery test still confirms the passport minimum capacity of 1900 mAh. <br><br>  <b>The discharge graph of the recovered batteries with a capacity of about 2000 mAh with a current of 1000 mA</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/549/8aa/eba/5498aaebab554c598ed85cac4ae4dc5f.jpg"><br><br>  When batteries are discharged with a higher current, the alignment of forces changes somewhat. <br><br>  The leader becomes a set of Varta Ready 2 Use 2100 mAh with a result of 2100 mAh.  Interesting is the fact that this kit has demonstrated a greater value of capacitance when discharging a current of 1000 mA than 500 mA. <br><br>  Next come the Ansmann maxE 2100 mAh and GP 210AAHC 2000 mAh kits.  The battery capacity of these sets is approximately 2000 mAh. <br><br>  Fujitsu HR-3UTC 1900 mAh and Panasonic BK-3MCCE 1900 mAh kits showed approximately 1900 mAh of capacity.  Despite the last place in this test, batteries reaffirm the minimum passport capacity. <br><br>  <b>Chart of discharge of new batteries with a capacity of about 2500 mAh with a current of 500 mA</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5b1/b0c/5f1/5b1b0c5f1b514b5599d53d11cdd804eb.jpg"><br><br>  With the results of batteries with higher capacity, everything is much more interesting. <br><br>  Ansmann 2850 mAh and GP 250AAHC 2450 mAh kits completely failed this test.  Some batteries were completely discharged, so there is no question of any use right after the purchase.  This fact indicates a high self-discharge of batteries. <br><br>  The Duracell Duralock 2400 mAh kit showed an average result with a residual capacity of 950 mAh.  Equal capacity of the batteries inside the kit suggests a low self-discharge of these batteries. <br><br>  Well, in the leading group are Fujitsu HR-3UTHC 2450 mAh and Panasonic BK-3HCCE 2450 mAh kits.  A residual capacity of approximately 1200 mAh makes it possible to use them with maximum efficiency immediately after purchase.  Equal battery capacity inside the kit also indicates low self-discharge of these batteries. <br><br>  <b>The discharge graph of the recovered batteries with a capacity of about 2500 mAh with a current of 500 mA</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f47/109/7b2/f471097b27c641dbb6d557f376a6c12d.jpg"><br><br>  The leader of this test was the Ansmann 2850 mAh kit.  At the same time, it was he who possessed the highest declared capacity, by as many as 400 mAh more competitors.  In this case, the batteries could not demonstrate the cherished passport number 2850 mAh.  The measured capacity was approximately 2600 mAh. <br><br>  The Duracell Duralock 2400 mAh, Fujitsu HR-3UTHC 2450 mAh and Panasonic BK-3HCCE 2450 mAh kits showed approximately equal results.  The measured capacity was 2400-2450 mAh. <br><br>  The worst kit in this test was the GP 250AAHC 2450 mAh.  Even after the restoration, he could not get to the values ‚Äã‚Äãdeclared by the manufacturer.  The measured battery capacity was 2300 mA * h, which is 150 mA * h below the minimum passport value. <br><br>  <b>Discharge graph of recovered batteries with a capacity of about 2500 mAh with a current of 1000 mA</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a9c/d34/db3/a9cd34db36c844d587d7a85745bba4ed.jpg"><br><br>  Discharge higher current arrangement of forces in principle does not change.  The same Ansmann 2850 mAh kit is in the lead, which again demonstrated the results of 2600 mAh, against the passport 2850 mAh. <br><br>  The measured capacity of batteries from Fujitsu HR-3UTHC 2450 mAh and Panasonic BK-3HCCE 2450 mAh batteries was 2400-2430 mAh.  This allows them to successfully rank 2 and 3 in the ranking. <br><br>  Batteries Duracell Duralock 2400 mAh dropped out of the previous group, for a higher discharge current with a slightly worse result.  The measured battery capacity was 2350-2400 mAh. <br><br>  Well, and traditionally closes the results of testing GP 250AAHC 2450 mAh batteries. <br><br>  Thanks to the Maha MH-C9000 charger with four independent channels and the ability to track the measured battery capacity during the discharge process and the elapsed time for this process, I made diagrams of all kits based on four batteries.  With their help, you can track the battery capacity inside each set and estimate the operating time of devices with consumption currents of 500 or 1000 mA. <br><br>  <b>Batteries with a capacity of about 2000 mAh</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/035/cdc/258/035cdc2582e64526b4b30a769712c4dd.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/532/145/1c9/5321451c9b86469aa9aef159b501e37b.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Batteries with a capacity of about 2500 mAh</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/822/96e/389/82296e3897424107ab96cc932b946b94.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/606/a52/c44/606a52c444e44a6c83bc26d73805b8aa.jpg"><br><br><hr><br>  However, the value of battery capacity is not always the decisive criterion for their selection.  Some manufacturers claim that their batteries are frost resistant.  For me, the typical temperature in winter is -15 degrees Celsius.  In addition, it is quite easily achieved in the freezer.  For those users who care about battery life under extreme conditions and the second part of the test is dedicated. <br><br>  For testing, I used the Fujifilm FinePix S3 Pro camera, in the battery store of which the batteries were frozen.  For one hour they were placed in a freezer, after which the temperature was monitored using a UNI-T UT303A pyrometer.  When the mark reached -15 degrees Celsius, the battery store was charged to the camera and then its performance in the burst mode was checked.  Below is a table showing the number of frames received with the participation of each battery pack. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/227/21c/2b4/22721c2b445c4ee881c44a653ec987db.jpg"><br><br>  As can be seen from the obtained results, the Duracell Duralock 2400 mAh, Fujitsu HR-3UTC 1900 mAh, Fujitsu HR-3UTHC 2450 mAh, Panasonic BK-3MCCE 1900 mAh and Panasonic BK-3HCCE 2450 mAh retained their working capacity.  If the manufacturers Fujitsu and Panasonic claimed this property for their batteries, then the kit from Duracell frankly surprised me pleasantly.  However, upon further study of this kit, the reason for this will be revealed.  But more about that later. <br><br>  Upset sets Ansmann maxE 2100 mAh and Ansmann 2850 mAh, the manufacturer of which declared this property.  But in fact it turned out to be completely different.  Perhaps at lower temperatures, they are able to demonstrate this quality.  But certainly not in these conditions. <br><br>  After the miracle from Duracell Duralock 2400 mAh, I was expecting something similar from Varta Ready 2 Use 2100 mAh.  But the second miracle did not happen.  The camera refused to work after the first shot.  Although LSD Ni-MH should cope with this task much better than conventional Ni-MH batteries. <br><br>  The GP 210AAHC 2000 mAh and GP 250AAHC 2450 mAh batteries also failed to provide a camera for more than one shot.  But the manufacturer did not declare these properties, so this time everything is fair. <br><br><hr><br>  Well, the final testing for batteries was the speed of readiness for operation of the Yongnuo YN560-III flash units after their pulse at full power. <br><br>  This testing broke them into the following groups: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Fujitsu HR-3UTC 1900 mAh, Fujitsu HR-3UTHC 2450 mAh, Panasonic BK-3MCCE 1900 mAh and Panasonic BK-3HCCE 2450 mAh <br>  ‚Ä¢ Duracell Duralock 2400 mAh <br>  ‚Ä¢ GP 210AAHC 2000 mAh <br>  ‚Ä¢ GP 250AAHC 2450 mAh, Varta Ready 2 Use 2100 mAh <br>  ‚Ä¢ Ansmann 2850 mAh <br>  ‚Ä¢ Ansmann maxE 2100 mAh <br><br>  After a long period of using Sanyo Eneloop and Sanyo Eneloop XX batteries, I honestly did not care for batteries from Fujitsu and Panasonic.  They honorably confirmed my expectations, having provided the shortest time of readiness of flashes. <br><br>  Again, I was pleasantly surprised by the kit from Duracell.  The difference in the speed of readiness of the flash, although it is felt, is not critical. <br><br>  GP batteries from the GP did not pretend to be in the lead, but they didn‚Äôt become "whipping boys" either, they sow firmly in the middle of the list. <br><br>  My main disappointment was the results of Ansmann maxE 2100 mAh and Varta Ready 2 Use 2100 mAh batteries.  After all, they are usually defined as the main competitors of Fujitsu HR-3UTC 1900 mAh or Panasonic BK-3MCCE 1900 mAh. <br><br>  To demonstrate the difference in flash availability time, I‚Äôll show two videos of Fujitsu HR-3UTC 1900 mAh against this pair of batteries. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/WNKpnnL2EDo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgz5XFHGbrKHs9yOP_3ROwcnEDqEA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/H4OnDlGC3DA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgd3hzCTd_V_PI1TkQAu5xqrnHQXQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Of course, it is very difficult to manufacture batteries that simultaneously satisfy the needs of a wide range of users.  In my opinion, the best batteries among those tested are Fujitsu HR-3UTHC 2450 mAh and Panasonic BK-3HCCE 2450 mAh.  They showed the best results in all tests, losing only by the value of the Ansmann 2850 mAh capacity, which, by the way, could not reach the declared passport values.  Their only disadvantage is 500 total charge / discharge cycles. <br><br>  A pleasant discovery for me was the Duracell Duralock 2400 mAh kit.  These batteries slightly failed to produce the results of the two sets mentioned above.  This is explained, perhaps, by the fact that the shape of the positive battery contact, the country of origin is Japan and the almost complete identity of the results with Fujitsu HR-3UTHC and Panasonic BK-3HCCE batteries make it possible to conclude that these batteries were not made at Duracell factories, but for example at FDK factories owned by the concern Fujitsu.  However, this does not diminish the merits of these batteries. <br><br>  If you continue to choose between sets with a capacity of about 2500 mAh, then the fourth place is in the Ansmann 2850 mAh set, and the last place in the GP 250AAHC 2450 mAh.  The advantage of the Ansmann kit is the highest capacity among the tested batteries.  Well, GP 250AAHC batteries can be bought at almost every corner.  When for models with the best results, you may have to chase even the residents of the capital. <br><br>  As for batteries with a capacity of about 2000 mAh, then the choice is somewhat more complicated.  If the user does not care about the maximum current from the batteries, the ability to work in extreme temperature conditions, then Ansmann maxE 2100 mAh or Varta Ready 2 Use 2100 mAh can be recommended for purchase.  They will do an excellent job with powering devices in greenhouse conditions, such as flash synchronizers in a photo studio, digital clock, wireless keyboards or mice.  Low level of self-discharge of batteries will allow the user to think about replacing or recharging them to a minimum. <br><br>  But if the above conditions are important for the user and he lives an active life, then it is worth making a choice in favor of the Fujitsu HR-3UTC 1900 mAh or Panasonic BK-3MCCE 1900 mAh.  At the same time, they also perfectly cope with the power supply of low-power devices, due to the low self-discharge.  In addition, these two sets have the largest stated number of charge / discharge cycles.  And the user can forget for a long time about the replacement of defective batteries, which are already not recoverable. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/368401/">https://habr.com/ru/post/368401/</a></p>
