One of the obvious ways to achieve this is to attract people to the exchange who have not yet worked on it, but who have an income level suitable for such activity. <br><br>  Naturally, you should take care of newcomers, giving them the opportunity to enter the stock market without the risk of financial losses.  From January 1, 2015, such a tool for beginners appeared in Russia - an <a href="http://www.itinvest.ru/services/individual-invest-chet/">individual investment account</a> (IIS). <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  What is it and for whom? </h4><br>  IIS is a brokerage account that gives its owner a natural person the right to tax benefits of two different types (see below).  On IIS you can deposit any amount of money up to 400 thousand rubles, these funds must be in the account for at least three years. <br><br>  The first type of exemption - a tax deduction of 13% of the amount paid - is suitable for people who are not going to try themselves as active investors, but simply want to keep their money not ‚Äúat home under the pillow‚Äù. <br><br>  It works this way - if a person in 2015 adds 400 thousand rubles to the account, then a tax deduction in the amount of 52 thousand rubles (13%) for this year will be returned to him.  Money can be made even in December, and in January to receive a deduction. <br><br>  In fact, the state simply pays citizens for opening accounts to work on the stock market a kind of scholarship - while no one obliges them to actually make any operations on the stock exchange.  At the same time there is no prohibition on investments - you can use money from IIS to trade on the stock exchange, receive profit from it and, in addition, also have the right to a tax deduction. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1e8/a9f/0e2/1e8a9f0e22700035359ca88dc689fad6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The second type of exemption is designed for those people who not only put money on IIS, but also actively use it for investments in bonds, securities, currency and other financial instruments (there are no restrictions on what to invest in). <br><br>  In this case, if the profit from performing operations for three years exceeds 100% of the amount initially deposited into the account, then this money is exempt from paying income tax (when working on the stock exchange from ‚Äúordinary‚Äù brokerage accounts, taxes must always be paid). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2da/6d3/4ef/2da6d34eff1eef4580a1ad45c5dd5c83.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The important point is that you can decide on the type of desired benefit (tax deduction or exemption from income tax) not immediately, but even at the end of the third year of the account.  The investor simply weighs all the pros and cons and communicates his decision to the broker who manages his IIS (to open such an account in ITinvest you need to fill out an <a href="http://www.itinvest.ru/services/individual-invest-chet/">application on the website</a> ). <br><br><h4>  What is more profitable for beginners </h4><br>  It all depends on the situation of a particular person - if he does not want to ‚Äúbother‚Äù with active investments (or is afraid of losing money) and is looking for a way to place some of his savings, then it is logical to use the right to a tax deduction. <br><br>  However, the disadvantage here is that after receiving the deduction for the first year, the money must hang on the account for another two years, otherwise the deduction will have to be returned.  At the same time, it is still possible to deposit additional money in the second year and receive a deduction from them (this ‚Äúnew‚Äù money will also actually be frozen until the end of the third year of the account), and in the third year repeat the procedure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/db9/f83/686/db9f83686f0a83ad0f09a26d26c5c7a6.png" alt="image"><br><br>  If we take for example that 400 thousand rubles are deposited each year (the maximum possible amount), then it turns out that in three years only 1 million 200 thousand will be accumulated on the IIS - it will be possible to remove them without losing the right to deductions only at the end of the third year .  In the current dynamically changing economic situation, such conditions are not suitable for everyone. <br><br>  There are other options for the conservative use of IIS.  One of them is <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/itinvest/blog/234149/">buying currencies on a stock exchange</a> at a more favorable rate than the one offered by exchangers (and without a huge difference in the price of buying and selling) or investing in Russian stocks (for example, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/itinvest/blog/229237/">Yandex</a> ) and foreign ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/itinvest/blog/244913/">Apple, Google, Facebook)</a> ) companies.  The right to tax deduction is retained. <br><br>  Another option that can be compared with a deposit in a bank is an investment in federal loan bonds (OFZ).  The owner of an investment account can buy such bonds for the entire amount of his account, having received a profit in the form of bond yields (now stands at 15%), plus that same tax deduction of 13% - the level of yield unprecedented for banks. <br><br>  The risks of working with OFZ do not exceed the risks of deposit storage in a bank.  Income on them is guaranteed by the state.  The circumstances in which the state will not be able to fulfill such obligations is a default, in which problems will also arise in the country's banking system (with corresponding consequences for household deposits). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0a2/c8c/8eb/0a2c8c8ebc52fbed0647b7ad9cea3a2a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In addition, some financial companies that operate as a broker and have their own bank offer various combinations of IIS accounts and ordinary deposits in the bank.  For example, you can create an account of IIS, get a deduction of 13%, and the next two years this account will be equal to the usual deposit (with the corresponding interest), but you will not be able to withdraw money before the end of the third year of funds storage. <br><br>  Learn more about IIS and options for using this account can be found in our video: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/SgZ42kfvgbo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhi_DSMRm-GkNQKMwOwtELtR4-NXOg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  Total </h4><br>  Investment accounts are not some kind of purely Russian innovation.  Such tools to stimulate investment activity have long been used all over the world, for example, in the USA there are individual retirement accounts IRA (more than 15 million accounts have been opened), in the UK - SIA individual savings accounts, in Canada - TSFA non-tax savings accounts. <br><br>  As a result, in the West, a large number of quite ordinary people are familiar with the stock market, for whom speculation on the stock exchange is not the main occupation.  However, they know that there are other tools besides banks for the preservation and enhancement of finances - diversification of assets is useful at all times. <br><br>  Now, the opportunity to deal with the stock market without unnecessary risk and acquire new knowledge (plus get a ‚Äúscholarship‚Äù in the amount of 13% of the state for such studies) has appeared among Russians. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/377285/">https://habr.com/ru/post/377285/</a></p>
