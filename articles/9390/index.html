  <section class="page js-page"><h1>OOP, IP, FP and Towers of Hanoi</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This is some attempt to illustrate the significant differences between OOP, OP <br>  (functional programming) and PI (imperative) and prove why PI <br>  is the preferred style of thinking when solving problems. <br>  I'll try to do all this using the example of solving the problem of the Hanoi towers. <br>  Naturally, I do not pretend to be called an experienced OO, F, or AND <br>  a programmer, but I still have some skills, and I will try them <br>  apply to this problem, but the course of my thinking is most likely possible and, more <br>  In addition, it will be necessary to criticize, constructively, in order <br>  reach the truth. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First, let me remind you of the essence of the problem.  Initially, three rods are given: 1, 2, 3 - on <br>  one of which is a turret strung out of N circles of different radii so that the circle <br>  a larger radius always has a smaller circle.  The program should make <br>  the plan of shifting these circles from the rod to the rod so that the turret <br>  turned on another rod.  In this case, each shift must save <br>  ordering of circles - any circle can lie only on a larger circle <br>  radius, or on an empty rod and you can only shift one of the most <br>  upper circles on rods. <br>  So, if a turret with a height of two circles, which lies on 1 rod, was originally given, <br>  and if it needs to be shifted to rod number 2, then one of the correct <br>  sequences <br>  moves will be: 1 -&gt; 3, 1 -&gt; 2, 3 -&gt; 2. In the rules N -&gt; M <br>  only the numbers of the rods are used and they mean: to shift the uppermost <br>  circle from rod N to rod M. <br>  Functional approach.  Considered first because it gives the classic <br>  'school' problem solving. <br>  We need to build a function. <br><br><pre>  move N abc </pre><br>  The function, which is the height of the turret, the initial rod a, the final rod b <br>  and an extra bar c will display a list of moves.  Hmm ... Well, from what other <br>  functions can concoct move?  Compilation of some functions from others - the essence <br>  approach.  We can come up with a function 
      <br>

      <br>
    <pre>  movetoken ab </pre><br>  which transfers a circle from one rod to another, but there is no sense from it <br>  will not, because it is not clear how to call it.  Need a little <br>  pomedetirovat and overshadow your brain with a brilliant functional concept: <br>  We look at the first example and see, in order to transfer the turret, we must first <br>  transfer its top to the auxiliary rod, move the lower circle to <br>  target, and then on the same rod to move the top of the turret.  Wherein <br>  the upper circles can be shifted to any rods, because all that <br>  below them has a larger radius. <br>  Hooray.  Task <br>  solved.  It remains only to understand what the move function must return and take <br>  for the cause.  But everything is simple, it does not give us any alternative to the OP list.  So for <br>  a business.  The implementation is schematic and resembles what you can write in Haskell. <br><br><pre> move N abc
 // transfer one circle to the target turret
 move 1 abc = (a, b)
 // transfer of the top to the rod c, transfer of a large circle to the rod b,
 // transfer the top from the rod c to the rod b
 move N abc = move (N - 1) acb: (a, b): move (N - 1) cba

 // well, we call something like this
 print move 16 1 3 2 
</pre><br>  Elegant, difficult to challenge. <br>  But now the object-oriented approach.  First you need to select <br>  objects.  Well, this is simple: circles and rods, as well as the turret itself, because <br>  we need a solution in the form of sending a message to some object.  Anything <br>  like. <br><br><pre>  tower.move (a, b, c) </pre><br>  Fine.  We have turrets, cups and rods.  And how to tie it all together <br>  through the sending of messages?  Hmm ... We will honor the back of the head and decide that from the rods in general <br>  There is no sense, from one chip, too, because it is not for nothing <br>  affects.  It remains to focus on the turret, scratch the pumpkin and say that <br>  the turret, it turns out, consists of two objects: the top, which also <br>  is a turret or missing, and a large circle at the bottom.  Cool. <br>  If we construct the object in this way, then the solution is again obvious.  Have a turret ask <br>  jump over to another rod using some auxiliary then she <br>  first asks to jump over its top to the auxiliary rod, then <br>  moves its base on the target rod and then asks to jump on <br>  this target rod is its tip.  Great, now let's roll a couple of classes. <br>  Everything is schematic and similar to Java.  All methods are open and data is closed. <br><br><pre> class Tower {
 // a is the pivot on which the turret stands, useful for checks on
 // invalid requests, for example move (1, 3), if the turret is at 1
 // rod.  For FIG know what kind of request will come, you must be reliable and
 // encapsulated.  But there are no checks in the code.
         int N, a;
         Tower top;

         Tower (N, position) {
                 if N&gt; 1 {
                         top = new Tower (N - 1, a);
                 }
                 else {
                         top = null;
                 }

                 this.N = N;
                 this.a = a;
         }

         List move (b, c) {// b - where to move, c - auxiliary bar
                 List l;

                 if top {
                         l.append (top.move (c, b));
                 }

                 l.append (a.toString + "-&gt;" + b.toString);

                 if top {
                         l.append (top.move (b, a);
                 }

                 a = b;  // moved to a new rod

                 return l;
         }
 }

 // launch
 System.out.print ((new Tower (N, 1)). Move (2, 3) .toString);
</pre><br>  Wow, that was awesome.  In elegance lost, but we have a cool <br>  an object that can check for errors is encapsulated and <br>  In general, all such a likable.  Presumably imperative approach <br>  merge even more elegance and lenses will not give cute, so, well, <br>  its in figs, in theory.  But we, reluctantly and break through his teeth. <br>  So, what do we have in the imperative approach?  Nothing: no functions, no objects. <br>  Is it only the state of a certain area of ‚Äã‚Äãmemory and a description of the changes of these <br>  states.  In the state, we may have lists of circles on each of the disks. <br>  Hmm ... Not very optimistic.  Well lists and lists, and what to do with them?  Hmm ... <br>  Lists.  Eureka, we still have a list of moves, some, but which ones? <br>  For example, we have a list of moves for transferring a turret two circles high with <br>  the first rod to the third through the second: 1 -&gt; 2, 1 -&gt; 3, 3 -&gt; 2. <br>  Fine.  What can you do with it?  Well, for example, replace the number plates. <br>  For example: 1 = 1, 2 = 3, 3 = 2. And get a program for transferring our <br>  households in two circles on the second rod: 1 -&gt; 3, 1 -&gt; 2, 3 -&gt; 2. Feel to <br>  What am I getting at? <br>  If now we have a program for transferring a two-level farm to the second <br>  column, then on the third we can now put the third largest pancake, and <br>  then, using the already well-known program for transferring 2-households, tper already with <br>  the first rod to the second through the third, making a substitution in it: <br>  1 = 2, 3 = 1, 2 = 3, we get the transfer program from the second rod to <br>  the third through the first.  And in the end we will become the owners of a wonderful program for <br>  transferring the 3-farm from the first rod to the third through the second.  And so on. <br><br>  It remains only to understand from which move to start such a program development.  But <br>  this is obvious: if the turret is of odd height, then the first move must be made <br>  on the target rod, otherwise on the auxiliary.  Solution is written <br>  on something like iscript. <br><br><pre> nextblock (cmdnew, cmdold, f) {
         a = f [0];  // current program is a permutation from a to b through c
         b = f [1];  // N top circles
         c = f [2];

         // move (N + 1) circle from a to c
         listappend (cmdnew, {.from = a; .to = b;});

         f [0] = b;  // generate a permutation from b to c through a
         f [1] = c;
         f [2] = a;

         i = cmdold.head;  on i;  i = i.next {
                 listappend (cmdnew, {.from = f [i.from]; .to = f [i.to];});
         }

         f [0] = a;  // now we have a permutation with a to c through b
         f [1] = c;  // (N + 1) households
         f [2] = b;
 }

 solve (N, a, b, c) {
         f [0] = a;
         if n% 2 {
                 f [1] = b;
                 f [2] = c; 

         }
         or {
                 f [1] = c;
                 f [2] = b;
         }

         on N;  N = N - 1 {
                 nextblock (fl, sl, f);
                
                 i = fl.head;  on i;  i = i.next {
                         print ("% 0 -&gt;% 0 \ n", i.from, i.to);
                 } 

                 listmove (sl, fl);  // move everything from the first list to the second
         }
 }

 solve (16, 2, 0, 1);
</pre><br>  Hm  It will be longer than the option OP or OOP.  But let's compare this code and those <br>  two options, and they can be considered similar to each other.  Attention can <br>  draw on a couple of features. <br>  First, program generation starts immediately, no need to wait long <br>  time until the recursion is over, which may be enough <br>  long, the complexity of the problem in moves grows exponentially.  Meanwhile famous <br>  moves can be sent for further parallel processing, for example, <br>  A program to visualize this very Hanoi game. <br>  Secondly, the imperative code is able to work with an infinite down pyramid. <br>  He doesn‚Äôt really need N at all, except to determine the first <br>  move <br>  Two recursive constructions can not do this.  Hmm ... A little philosophical <br>  digression: perhaps this is beyond the power of recursive construction just because <br>  uncertainty with the first move.  Recursion must always be defined.  But <br>  This is a note for future analysis. <br>  In the end, I personally (I emphasize: I personally, the ultimate truth <br>  I do not pretend) the above reasoning inclines to the next look at <br>  approaches to programming. <br>  Programs need to be considered exactly as dynamic systems, that is, <br>  systems described by state changes. <br>  When we start trying <br>  formulate the functionality in the form of static mappings, as in <br>  functional programming, we are forced to limit ourselves <br>  1. dynamically, since the value of a function must be calculated before we <br>  we can use it <br>  2. in efficiency and distribution: if the calculated value is potentially <br>  can be used before its full calculation, then within <br>  We do not have the ability to do classic OP. <br>  Of course, solutions to these problems were found: in ML you can write <br>  imperative programs, in Haskell there are monads that imperative dynamics <br>  The calculations assign to each other infinite lists of values ‚Äã‚Äãthat are <br>  The trajectories of this dynamic are not the most convenient solution, imho. <br>  When we try to look at programs as interacting through <br>  special interfaces, objects, we again lose our dynamism.  Because <br>  the objects in our intuitive view correspond at all to the processes <br>  not at all dynamic structures.  In this example, the natural <br>  way (in my opinion, of course, but supported by many textbooks on <br>  OOP, in which similar tasks, about 8 fr√®zes, for example, are exactly how they are solved), <br>  object was selected: turret.  And we see what this abstraction leads to - <br>  immediate construction of a recursive algorithm, with all the consequences <br>  disadvantages. <br>  Well, of course, in the case of an implicit OOP, data generation for the visualizer <br>  you can start right away as the recursion reaches the first bottom, but it can <br>  reach it very long.  As part of the OP, this can also be done, but several <br>  confusing.  In addition, we must not forget that we do not <br>  we can solve the problem with the infinite tower in the chosen system of objects. <br>  It is precisely because OOP and FP limit the programmer‚Äôs ability to <br>  see the dynamics in the task, personally I never use them in the design. <br>  I focus on how the data should flow in the program and how it should <br>  change and this leads in my opinion to more beautiful and simple <br>  solutions.  Because the world is dynamic, because design is much <br>  closer to physical reality than objects or functions because there is no <br>  objects or functions in nature.  There are only dynamic systems, like trying <br>  prove to us modern physics.  So why limit your mind <br>  focus on static models of reality, which are the FP and <br>  OOP?  OP by its mathematical nature, and OOP for the reason that in <br>  modern form captures the mind on analogies with passive <br>  material objects. <br>  In fairness it should be noted that in our example the object could be <br>  choose just a chain of moves, and build a similar imperative solution <br>  the program, BUT OO, the programmer begins with a search for obvious objects, and not with <br>  analysis of the dynamics, which limits its design capabilities, <br>  and this often leads him to decisions that are more similar in their <br>  structure on the OP.  Within the framework of the OP approach, this could also potentially be <br>  but much more difficult to do, and it would be possible to cheat the endless turret <br>  only in functional languages ‚Äã‚Äãwith completely lazy execution, within the framework of <br>  the same lamda-abstraction, such a calculation will be non-computable.  What again, by the way, <br>  It proves that a computer is much more than a Turing machine. <br>  In addition, programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãincline to such design, <br>  who call themselves OO.  In them, objects are not <br>  dynamic messaging entities as it was intended back in <br>  Smalltalk, namely static <br>  abstract data types, no more.  A dynamic object that lives its own <br>  life is quite difficult to create.  It resists even in distributed <br>  technologies, the same croba, in <br>  which objects come to life only upon request, and just the very possible way <br>  implementations: launching a separate thread, and accessing shared data with an interface <br>  using synchronization.  This is the creation of a full-fledged client-server. <br>  applications coming out.  But the PLO, again, is inclined to create it not in the form of a process, <br>  but in the form of a set of objects, which again turn out to be dead and non-dynamic <br>  at its core.  It is difficult to organize a real data flow between them, their <br>  difficult to run in parallel, because for this they need to be done again <br>  servers. <br>  Meanwhile, some languages, which began as purely functional solutions, in <br>  eventually evolved to provide the ability to create just such entities <br>  - processes exchanging messages.  Erlang and O'Caml, an example, but this <br>  the opportunity is based on the close to the imperative functionality of these <br>  Languages: on monads or the explicit ability to store states.  When clean <br>  imperative structural approach with this in general no problems: <br>  Limbo, Ada or something like IPC on UNIX. <br>  Actually the call is based on this (not only mine, by the way: <br>  <a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/pikestyle.html">http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/pikestyle.html</a> ) refuse OOP and OP wherever <br>  Only this is possible, and focus on analyzing data changes in <br>  programs, on properties of states and on the logic of changes. <br>  The next <br>  retreat: modern physics considers existing, yes it is intuitive <br>  it is clear that it preserves the properties in the process of change, without focusing on <br>  analysis of the dynamics in the program can not accurately identify the saved properties, and <br>  hence the objects.  Such an analysis leads to more flexible solutions, and to more effective ones. <br>  Interfaces, functions, modules, classes will arise naturally in the process. <br>  implementation of the program.  And they can be reused. <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/9390/">https://habr.com/ru/post/9390/</a></p>
