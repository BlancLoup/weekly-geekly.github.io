Look at the competitors, try to figure out the main figures, understand what keeps the business.  For different projects it will be completely different numbers.  If you sell yachts, the business is probably holding on 5 deals a year, which grow out of 100 leads, which led you to 3 accounts, who spent the whole year hanging out in the right places with the right people. <br><br>  If you make the mobile application indicators easier and more familiar.  Today we will tell about the first results of the test launch of our mobile content browser <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.indxnews">Indexisto</a> (read the project description in the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/239455/">article</a> on Habr√©), understand the obtained indicators and think about the prospects. <br><br> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.indxnews"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fc1/ff2/ace/fc1ff2ace57e46a19a4f4d62928162cd.png"></a>

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  We defined the main indicators for our projects as: <br><ul><li>  Number of page views per person </li><li>  Cost per 1000 impressions (CPM) </li><li>  Retention </li><li>  Market volume of readers in general </li></ul><br>  which is quite reasonable for a content reader.  The combination of these indicators and allow us to take off (or not to take off) <br><br>  Being in the test mode, we collected the first positive reviews and, most importantly, the first digits of our own statistics.  Possessing these figures and analyzing competitors, we can already make certain predictions. <br><br><h4>  Number of page views per person </h4><br>  This is a very important indicator for all applications of this type.  For a content web project, <b>2-3</b> page views per person and a very high <i>bounce rate</i> is the norm.  Naturally, such a low indicator did not suit us and it was important to understand what this indicator is in our Indexisto.  It turned out an average of <b>18</b> page views per person: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4e4/318/9ad/4e43189adcc94c23a65c5cd5a36432dc.png"><br>  The pages we have are naturally mobile app screens.  We consider opening articles, switching to a new feed, and loading when scrolling down (when a person rewinds 15 articles down). <br><br>  Also, people make several visits to the application per day and spend quite a lot of time in it (session about <b>10 minutes</b> ).  This indicator is encouraging.  The Indexisto usage pattern is completely different from the regular content pattern of the project. <br><br><h4>  Retention (returns to the application) </h4><br>  This indicator is the most important for our application.  The whole idea is based on the fact that for a certain group of people our application will become a constant daily pastime. <br><br>  It is quite difficult to obtain the data of competitors, but something is leaking.  for example <br><ul><li>  Anews at RIF 2015 speaks of 300,000 active users with 2,500,000 installes, which gives retention about 12%. </li><li>  The Mint application in an interview a year ago, in the person of its manager, <a href="http://top.rbc.ru/economics/22/09/2014/950573.shtml">talks</a> about 100,000 active users with 1,000,000 installations - 10% retention. </li></ul><br>  Our retention for Google Analytics is around 13%. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f09/a92/bc4/f09a92bc4c834dfdaa8588668d3e638a.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4c4/370/456/4c437045645d403baff831ac798b9305.png"><br><br>  But on sensations and other measurements in reality it is still a little lower.  In principle, the average is obtained on the market, but it does not suit us.  Need to work with the first install, the selection of the right content, personalization of the application.  Little by little we begin work in this direction. <br><br><h4>  Cost per 1000 impressions (CPM) </h4><br>  It's about advertising <b>in the</b> application.  That is what we will earn. <br>  There are no special secrets. <br>  It all depends on the country you are targeting and how hard you will place ad units.  We interviewed colleagues, application owners and the ad networks themselves.  Contacted content projects to understand the cost of the river from them when buying directly.  For the Russian-speaking audience, we are talking about the amount from 30 to 100 rubles per 1000 impressions.  In the west, this figure is several times higher.  With this, mobile advertising is now one of the fastest growing segments. <br><br><h4>  Market volume of readers in general </h4><br>  Despite the fairly well-known applications like Flipboard and Feedly, you will not find them even in the <a href="https://www.appannie.com/apps/ios/top/">Top-500</a> application <a href="https://www.appannie.com/apps/ios/top/">charts</a> . <br>  At the same time, it cannot be said that there are no news and entertainment applications in the top at all.  There is Yahoo News, CNN - these applications do not require any settings and add your feeds or interests. <br><br>  The conclusion suggests itself - the majority of people have enough of the content that they see on Facebook and the fact that they are given by big news brands.  And the need for classic RSS consumption with the addition of its sources is not so great - we are talking about 10-15% of users.  Still, on a global scale, these are huge numbers. <br>  Also, the readers are now completely different from what RSS users are used to.  Everything becomes much more complicated.  Recommendations, rankings based on transitions from social networks (SmartNews, popular in the USA) are appearing, content delivery is changing to please the youth audience (‚ÄúDisco Discovery‚Äù). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/68e/d47/66b/68ed4766b6664eba91426c306a16645a.jpg"><br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br>  While we have in the application is not much traffic, but those people who use it do it regularly and a lot.  This is a positive signal for us. <br><br>  Over the past year, the printing press in the world has lost another 5% of turnover, and the need for information and entertainment has not disappeared, so that everything is just beginning. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290178/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290178/</a></p>
