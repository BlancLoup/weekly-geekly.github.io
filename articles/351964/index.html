"Network Basics".  "The value of Cisco products for security."  Eddie Martin  December 2012 </h4><br>  We use the method known to you and divide the board into two parts - security and safety from Cisco.  What do customers think about security? <br><br>  Security is primarily concerned with CXO - managers responsible for working together, or interacting in a company.  Therefore, you should often talk about security with these people. <br><br>  They control the process of sharing data and what is happening on the network, what is needed for effective interaction between people and products, because this is an important financial aspect of the company's work. <br><br>  Did you know that the TJ Maxx department store chain has lost 250 thousand credit card numbers of its customers?  The company's network has been attacked, with the result that hackers obtained data on card transactions of nearly 45 million clients.  Surely this data leak occurred through their employees.  Their security was based on wireless devices, but what was good in 1998 was no longer suitable for 2002.  And they could not stop trading, as this would lead to the collapse of the business. <br><br>  Such cases are well known to CXO and they understand their danger, because half or even most of the company's success is ensured by the brand's reputation and brand image.  Distrust of reputation leads to huge losses. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qa/zu/p9/qazup9hau37cmchookraqvf1hcc.jpeg"><br><br>  The second aspect on which CXOs are concerned about security issues is the integrity of the information and its veracity.  After all, they sign reports with the data that is sent up to the ‚Äúbig boss‚Äù, and if something is wrong with this data, they will immediately lose their job.  Before signing a document or report, the CXO asks the CIO: ‚ÄúCan I not be afraid to sign it?  Because of this, I will not be sent to prison? ‚Äù  Therefore, they must "keep the tools in place", and Cisco helps them in this. <br><br>  Next, we write the item "Promotion of the goal."  This is facilitated by the introduction of new technologies, new ways of doing business, hundreds of people in black hats are constantly engaged in this.  And in third place is the ‚ÄúData‚Äù item, the security of which is important for the client. <br><br>  Let's go now to Cisco.  We have products that integrate security solutions.  They do not need to be further protected; they already have protection inside.  These are special applications that are used to solve specific security aspects.  We can protect the Internet connection, mail, and so on.  We invest heavily in security. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ds/dq/qh/dsdqqhvlu3mjhgh1cjuk8blbyxc.jpeg"><br><br>  Next, Cisco offers the client cloud solutions.  It is very economical.  We can host security software in the Cloud or use a hybrid approach to security.  We use ASA on our site and when we need to go to an external site, it places it in the Cloud and so spreads the effect on the Internet.  Therefore, the same security policies operate within our network and outside it.  This is important for customers, because they can not post it on their website, but use the Cloud.  We can do the same with the firewall. <br><br>  The following are services and technical support.  We have very good security partners.  Cisco is not engaged in the development of security technologies directly, for this we have partners.  These are small partners with small practices and ‚Äúgold‚Äù partners that cover all areas of security.  They sell us certain solutions, we use them.  We can say that Cisco looks out from behind their shoulders, or vice versa - who knows? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/w7/_5/wb/w7_5wbur0kbgxwbiow1vfxgqa08.jpeg"><br><br>  And the last point, as usual, is followed by Cisco investment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zj/kz/lh/zjkzlhcncluwappt6pqupn6lqu8.jpeg"><br><br>  We had one client who conducted numerous clinical trials, and he wanted to take part in a tender tender contract with the largest manufacturer of drugs.  The condition for the conclusion of the contract was the purchase of equipment to ensure the safety of research for 350 thousand dollars, so the client was forced to buy it in order to participate in the tender.  So, we opened a credit line for him and provided a loan, and he won this contract.  Our client took into account the cost of purchased equipment in the cost of clinical trials, which lasted two years, and paid for his expenses so that he did not have to pay 350 or 400 thousand dollars at once, taking into account the interest, he repaid the loan monthly.  So Cisco's capital also plays an important role in security matters. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/67rb0mxk5SY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Continued:</b> <br><br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/ua-hosting/blog/352080/">FastTrack Training.</a>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/ua-hosting/blog/352080/">"Network Basics".</a>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/ua-hosting/blog/352080/">"Understanding Cisco Architectural Games (Overview)".</a>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/ua-hosting/blog/352080/">Eddie Martin</a>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/ua-hosting/blog/352080/">December 2012</a> <br><br>  Thank you for staying with us.
