They promised her last fall.  It seemed to be already unfinished according to the Zhdalker scheme, but in November the date of the start of sales is December 11, 2009. <br><br><img src="http://grab.by/1azs" alt="Disciples 3" title="Disciples 3"><br><br>  Actually, the desired day came on Friday.  To say that the game is swept away - to say nothing.  However, it was smooth only on paper ...

      <i>Summary of topics: wait with the purchase of the game.</i> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Yes, and judge for yourself.  How could it be otherwise?  If, on the eve of the beginning of purchases, when the disks are already stamped and <s>two</s> shops go urgently, <a href="http://www.disciples3.ru/forum/showthread.php%3Ft%3D6641">three</a> updaters are released ( <b>three</b> , <a href="http://disciples3.ru/forum/showthread.php%3Ft%3D6634%26page%3D7">two</a> , <a href="http://www.disciples3.ru/forum/showthread.php%3Ft%3D6641">three</a> ) ‚Äúemergency‚Äù patches that should fix the problem with starting (sic!) The game that occurs, the overwhelming majority users, if not all, and other "stability problems", as well as some game problems.  However, the patch does not help many people either: most often it is Win7 owners who are advised to wait for a special patch. <br><br><h1>  But wait!  There is more! </h1><br>  So, after installing the patches for the rest of the majority, the game still starts (somehow, not from the main menu, only from the game folder, but it can be patient).  However, normally playing, again, is impossible because of the monstrous technical, and sometimes gaming bugs. <br>  I just quote the most popular problems from the forum. <br><ul><li>  Regular departures.  Is always.  Both on the map and from the battlefield.  Sometimes with OS hang / reboot </li><li>  Music.  The composition on the card plays to the end and constantly ‚Äústutters‚Äù - it turns its last 5 seconds, before going into battle mode.  In combat mode, the same before switching to map mode. </li><li>  After Alt + Tab it is impossible to return to the game.  Only black screen.  The process is removed only from the Task Manager. </li><li>  Because of the departures, people are often saved to somehow be saved, <i>but everything is provided for</i> : saves are often not loaded.  Tip: make more saves. </li><li>  Unable to summon golem (in map mode).  The spell requires pointing at a friendly target, but when you hover at the target, the icon is crossed out, as the hero is already there.  In DI, the DII golem was cast anywhere. </li><li>  Some units (for example, healers) when upgrading do not receive an increase to the basic skill (for example, treatment).  People on the forums are already finding places in the files where to rule in order to put an increase </li><li>  At times, a unit remains alive with 0 health, which is impossible to kill.  For some, this means the impossibility of completing the quest, and therefore pass the game. </li><li>  Here are <a href="http://disciples3.ru/forum/showpost.php%3Fp%3D176245%26postcount%3D475">34 game bugs</a> from one attentive user. </li></ul><br>  And it's not that there was no beta test.  There was a long stubborn closed betatest.  Maybe we are just spoiled by Blizzard and have forgotten about the harsh igrostroy?  (You cannot say Russian, because the same Heroes 5, made by Russian Nival, did not contain such a number of shortcomings).  I don‚Äôt know when I‚Äôll decide to play it myself now, but in the place of those who haven‚Äôt had time to buy the game, I‚Äôd wait until the <s>best times for</s> correcting mistakes, otherwise the continuation of the turn-based strategy masterpiece will simply be hopelessly flawed ... <br><br><img src="http://img197.imageshack.us/img197/8929/negoduju.jpg" alt=" !" title="I resent!"><br><br>  <b>Update:</b> <br><h1>  But wait!  There is even more! </h1><br>  It turns out that there is often a problem that the <b>license key is</b> completely <b>absent</b> in the purchased license disk <b>aka serial number</b> . <br>  In a normal situation, the serial number is pasted on the box with the disk and must be under the disk, that is, you need to remove the disk to see it.  <i>Go Akella!</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/78134/">https://habr.com/ru/post/78134/</a></p>
