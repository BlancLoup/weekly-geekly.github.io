With the help of the Ruward team, we launched our new project focused on web studios and digital agencies - Inforzu. <br><br> <a href="http://agency.inforza.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7ef/0f6/18a/7ef0f618a08a67fb992bba618b701549.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://agency.inforza.ru/">Inforza</a> is an exchange of orders for digital services (website development, SEO, contextual advertising, SMM, mobile, etc.). We attract potential customers' applications for certain services, publish them on the exchange - and agencies acquire those that they like.  We work on a CPL model (cost per lead).

      A number of differences Inforza from existing analogues (freelance sites, gates CMS-systems, tender platforms): <br><br><ol><li>  One of the important differences - we give contacts on the application in no more than 5 companies.  This means that the client will not have to dig out spam from hundreds of typical KPs, for which the studios spent less than 5 minutes of their time.  On the other hand, the agency knows that the contact did not hit a thousand competing companies - and it will work with it more effectively (after all, the potential efficiency is so much higher). <br><br></li><li>  Applications for Inforza are purchased by auction model.  This means that after the application is published, an auction is held on it - the agencies themselves choose which bid to make (and how interesting the application is for them).  At the end of the auction, the contacts on the request are given to no more than 5 companies that have made the maximum bids (descending).  Thus, the system self-regulates - and the client receives feedback from the companies that were most interested in their project. <br><br></li><li>  If the bid was not bought at auction 5 times, it is archived - and it can be purchased instantly at the lowest price.  By the way, lead prices for us start at 50 rubles, which is less than the bids in contextual advertising per click on queries like ‚Äúwebsite creation‚Äù. <br><br></li><li>  In spite of the fact that applications from individuals are published in our country - we are focused on b2b - and in the future the percentage of applications from private traders will decrease. </li></ol><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At one time (two years ago) we launched the predecessor project for WebLeads, which received quite warm reviews, but could not bring it to mind - there were not enough resources and concentration.  But it was time to think about how everything should work.  And now we have reincarnated as <a href="http://agency.inforza.ru/">Inforza</a> . <br><br>  Now we are in the "point zero".  Applications, which are currently published on Inforza, may not be particularly impressive with budgets and full descriptions.  We are testing more than 50 channels to attract customers at the same time, and this will take some time. <br><br>  At the moment we have set up a stream of requests for vertical creation of sites, and in the near future we will launch SEO, contextual advertising, SMM and the development of mobile applications. <br><br><h4>  Future plans </h4><br>  Already within the framework of the next update, we implement the following useful pieces: <br><br><ul><li>  Launch of the flow of applications in the areas of contextual advertising, SEO, mobile application development and SMM. </li><li>  Launching a special category of ‚Äúsubcontracting‚Äù applications for its own - from agencies and for agencies. </li><li>  Launching a system for evaluating the quality of applications by channels - in order to cut off the least effective ones. </li><li>  Launch of the "Informer" - a flexible system for setting notifications about everything that happens on Inforza. </li><li>  Start accepting affiliate applications that are not suitable for other agencies for various reasons.  In fact, it is a functional for the exchange of unclaimed requests.  You can simply change the applications you do not need for those that are interesting. </li></ul><br>  And by the end of the year we will put into operation even more good features: <br><br><ul><li>  Launch auto broker for the automatic purchase of applications on the parameters that interest you. </li><li>  Connect all remaining verticals. </li><li>  Launch of the catalog and windows of studios of unprecedented beauty and convenience - with the ability to attract customer traffic </li><li>  Launch of profile content tape for interactive communications market agencies </li><li>  Launch of a VIP club for tenders for clients working in a high (from 1 million rubles) price segment </li></ul><br><h4>  Some questions </h4><br>  <b>Where do you get applications from?</b> <br><br>  We use all available channels to attract customers, the competence for which the Inforza team has increased over a decade of experience in the market. <br><br>  This includes direct purchases of traffic through contextual advertising, social networks, local sites, and the conduct of complex special projects, PR-activity, offline advertising channels, partner channels.  We use not only the Inforza head <a href="http://inforza.ru/">client site</a> , but also various kinds of landing pages, for example, <a href="http://inforza.ru/makesite">such</a> . <br><br>  <b>How large orders are published on Inforze?</b> <br><br>  Most of the applications in the system are in the low price segment (10 - 100 thousand rubles, if we talk, for example, about the creation of sites).  This is explained by the fact that customers with large budgets, as a rule, have quite qualified managers who understand the market and are able to form a list of companies for the tender themselves - from their own experience, ratings, portfolios, etc. Our system is usually used by clients with little experience on the Internet. <br><br>  In this case, the system often contains orders with budgets that significantly exceed the aforementioned frames. <br><br>  <b>How high is the quality of your applications?</b> <br><br>  This is a rather complicated question.  We are not going to deceive anyone and say that 100% of our applications can immediately be put to work.  This is not true.  Also, as with normal incoming requests to your agency, among our applications there are inadequate customers, customers who just find out the prices, but are not ready to work right now, fake requests from competitors. <br><br>  Manual moderation allows you to cut off the obvious inadequate, but does not guarantee that the customer will be good.  We (so far) do not call customers - otherwise the cost of applications in the system would be significantly higher. <br><br>  You should not expect that you buy one application and immediately enter into a contract.  Exit to normal statistics is possible only if you buy the number of applications, different from the units - otherwise there is a great chance that you just do not have luck.  Be sure to keep this in mind! <br><br>  We will be grateful for any feedback - bugs, comments, suggestions for improving the functionality and new features.  <a href="http://agency.inforza.ru/agent/register">Register</a> , try and write your first impressions in the comments. <br><br>  Regards, Terekhov Andrey </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/191024/">https://habr.com/ru/post/191024/</a></p>
