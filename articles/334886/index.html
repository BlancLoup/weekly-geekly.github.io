  <section class="page js-page"><h1>PGHACK. Avito Office Competition September 2</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In December 2016, my colleague <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/kevteev/" class="user_link">kevteev</a> said that it would be nice to stir up the mitap on postgres next year at the Avito site.  And shortly before that, the security men invited me to participate in several CTFs, including one Attack Defense.  And I answered him: ‚ÄúWhy not stir up the postgrese hackathon?‚Äù.  And now we have prepared the first in-person competition in Russia for PostgreSQL specialists, and today I want to invite you to it. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/avito/blog/334886/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/1c5/ad5/09a/1c5ad509ada84e26b4bfd59a24d3c5bd.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  What is PGHACK?  At its core, this competition is a bit like contests for information security professionals, <a href="https://ctfnews.ru/what-is-ctf/">CTF</a> .  The difference is that PGHACK was developed by us, taking into account the tasks faced by specialists working with databases.  And this is not only a competition, but also professional communication.  We have not heard anyone hold similar thematic events in this format. <br><br><h3>  PGHACK - for whom? </h3><br>  We are waiting for the competition of specialists working with databases: developers, programmers, administrators.  DevOps engineers and full-stack developers with a large knowledge base on the topic will be able to participate.  It is advisable to understand: 
      <br>

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

        </script>
      <br>
    <ul><li>  What is MVCC; </li><li>  how triggers work; </li><li>  how the database ensures the validity of the data stored in the table; </li><li>  how to administer Linux - you need to be able to install the program from the source code and build it manually. </li></ul><br><h3>  Competition mechanics </h3><br><h4>  The first stage, correspondence, qualifying </h4><br>  At this stage we accept applications for participation in PGHACK.  For this you need to enter registration data and answer 5 questions in the form <a href="http://bit.ly/2vlq6W1">on this page</a> .  Participants who propose the correct solutions will have the opportunity to compete for victory in the final round.  Selection criteria: the correct answers and their speed.  The time of the stage is from today, 7.08, and until 25.08.  If we select 50 finalists before this deadline, then we immediately close the registration to the TimePad.  All those who fill out the form on the event page will receive letters with the results of the selection stage. <br><br><h4>  PGHACK finals in Avito Moscow office </h4><br>  At the end of the first stage, we will invite 50 participants to Avito Moscow office on September 2.  To participate in the final round, you need a laptop with VirtualBox (version 5.1.24 or later), 20Gb of free hard disk space and 3GB of RAM.  A virtual machine will be provided on site.  If you need to - help set up the environment.  And the game will begin! <br><br>  First you need to solve the problem of restoring database health.  This will require not so much encyclopedic knowledge of how it is arranged, but rather, care.  Other tasks of the competition can be solved in any sequence.  It will be necessary to know (or quickly understand) the mechanisms that are used in the operation of the PostgreSQL database, to be able to identify errors in its work, to find flaws in operation. <br><br>  Results will be determined by an automatic test system in real time simultaneously for all participants.  For the assignment will be awarded a different number of points - depending on their complexity.  The criteria for deriving the rating are the same as in the verification stage: correctness and speed of the decision.  If during the performance of any task the participant violates the decision of another task, the points for him are canceled. <br><br><h3>  Partners </h3><br>  The competition partners are <a href="https://pgday.ru/">PGDay Russia</a> , our favorite St. Petersburg specialized conference, and <a href="https://www.meetup.com/postgresqlrussia/">#RuPostgres</a> , the Russian-speaking community of developers and users of this DBMS, with whom we have held joint events more than once. <br><br><h3>  Prizes </h3><br>  Of course, where the competition takes place, there must be awards.  The main prize of PGHACK is a quadrocopter.  The winner will also receive a ticket to PG Day Russia'2018.  Participants from the TOP-10 will get sets with Arduino, gadgets, mini-kopter.  And of course, everyone present at the finale prepared souvenirs from Avito.  We will certainly provide all the pizza and a pleasant company of pros.  See you! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/334886/">https://habr.com/ru/post/334886/</a></p>
