  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Speech Tips</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I want to share with you some tips on how to write a good speech for public speaking.  They will help someone who wants to speak so that he understood and appreciated. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Before writing a speech for a speech, make up for yourself a small brief.  Sit down with a piece of paper and determine your reference points.  Here is what you need to find out initially: <br><ul><li>  Where and when will the show take place? </li><li>  What is the time limit for the speech, how many minutes will you have to speak and how many to answer public questions? </li><li>  What public is expected?  Will it be ordinary people or interested professionals?  Will they ask questions? </li><li>  What writing style is acceptable, free or business? </li><li>  What will you be wearing?  Will you be able to move or will you read the speech static? </li></ul><br>  The list of questions is endless - leave him at the mercy of your scrupulousness.  In any case, you should know everything about what you will tell and about who you will tell this to.  If the speech will be important, it would not be bad to go and get acquainted with the place where you will be listened to.  At this organizational issues can be considered settled, proceed to writing the text of speech. <br><br>  Immediately I say - I strongly advise you not to read this with a piece of paper before the public (unless, of course, you want to be heard).  It is embarrassing and disrespectful to read the text into pieces of paper; it is clever and permissible to pry into the theses of his speech.  I advise you to have the full speech of your speech, but tell it by theses.

      It is not easy to write a good speech, and the main difficulty is to start it.  Sometimes it is a pity to look at how cool a specialist, the one who knows best about an object in a galaxy, cannot spend a few sentences for hours, nervous and crumpling the paper.  And all because he is trying to write a speech from the beginning - so it is not written. <br><br>  Start writing a speech from the middle.  Highlight several main points of your speech, relegating each one to one sentence - this is how you will have the ‚Äúskeleton‚Äù of the speech.  After that, you can safely build up around him "meat", revealing the main theses in more detail.  During this process, the original theses can be reformulated for the beauty of the presentation, but keep their original form - they will come in handy later.  Ideally, you will have several paragraphs of the text - the basis of speech.  now is the time to write its conclusion - just formulate a conclusion from all that you have written (three sentences will suffice).  The last stage is the creation of the entry.  It's great to use a quote, metaphor or a funny ‚Äúon topic‚Äù story for the introduction - it will help the public to relax a bit and tune in to the same wave with you.  Do not feel sorry for the words - write as detailed as possible, not paying attention to the volume of the test.  Here are some stylistic speech writing tips: <br><ul><li>  Use simple sentences.  If you want to break a sentence into a few simple ones, feel free to do it.  In speech, we rarely speak in sentences containing more than five words. </li><li>  Do not use quotes, brackets and other punctuation marks that you cannot mark with a voice. </li><li>  Write all numbers in words.  Not "in the XIX century," but "in the nineteenth century."  This will help you not to waste time on the visual decoding of such symbols. </li><li>  Shrink the numbers.  Is it worth using 76,56523567 in such precision?  Perhaps it is necessary to reduce the number to "seventy-six point six"?  And in general, a good habit is to display numbers on the screen in a presentation. </li></ul><br>  For the same reason, it is better to transcribe foreign words in advance.  "... A striking example of the use of product play ..." reads better than "... a clear example of using product placement ...". <br><br>  After everything is written, start reading all out loud, noting ‚Äúcurved places‚Äù (or reformulate them right away).  Shorten or overly complex pieces cut or boldly discard.  Do not edit the text of speech more than twice in one day - you can easily forget your nose and can ‚Äúfix it too much‚Äù.  A couple of runs on the text and enough, continue tomorrow.  You can also connect to the process of improving the speech of friends or relatives.  To do this, you need to read it out loud, and then discuss everything that it seemed strange or incomprehensible to the audience. <br><br>  The final stage of writing the text of speech - reduction.  As the authors of the book ReWork said, ‚Äúthey wrote a book - and now cut it in half‚Äù.  Did you note the time when you read it out loud?  Do you fit into the regulations?  And you need to meet - safely reduce everything!  Also, do not forget to reduce it with a small excess - you will spend 20% of your time without noticing it, for random questions and for small "ideas." <br><br>  As a result, all in your hands you will have a beautiful and clear speech.  The next step is the preparation of theses of the speech.  It is with them that you will perform (more precisely, you will pry them into them on occasion). <br><br>  Remember, we put aside the list of theses appearances?  Here we need it.  It needs to be modified to reflect the changed speech.  Do not forget - for each thesis one sentence. <br><br>  All that remains after this is to learn speech.  Do not try mindlessly memorize it.  Just read it five or six times, and then, putting the theses in front of you, try to calmly tell the plan.  A couple of runs and you are almost ready. <br><br>  Well, and finally - a couple of tips for a speech: <br><ul><li>  Try to relax as much as possible.  A few minutes before the speech, do not read anything (especially your speech).  Listen carefully to other speakers, try to feel the atmosphere of the hall. </li><li>  Leave the speech in the hall, take only theses with you.  They will be your plan.  Feel free to pry into them. </li><li>  If the room is large and you expect questions - write on the board or print your phone number or twitter on the slide - offer to send questions by SMS and replies.  This will help the hall to ask questions boldly, and you will only answer those you like. </li><li>  Respect the time limit - watch the time.  But remember that for a couple of minutes in which case it can be broken. </li><li>  On forget to relax the atmosphere with jokes and metaphors.  It is necessary to finish the speech with a joke.  Thank the audience for their attention. </li><li>  After the speech, track feedback and positive criticism - it will help you make the performance better. </li></ul><br><br>  The article is written by the authors <a href="http://bigideas.ru/">BigIdeas</a> specifically for the hardware community. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/116694/">https://habr.com/ru/post/116694/</a></p>
