  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Megaphone is not a customer-oriented company or down O'Light</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Everyone probably remembers what the excitement was when this tariff plan appeared, a minute of a call and sms to any Moscow operator for one cent, then the price was raised but not much to 3 cents and at the same time they gave a bonus in the form of ‚Äúevery incoming minute = 1 cent‚Äù.  A freebie and just do not care that you need to buy a card renewal.  The price of it grew along with its popularity.  Then it was removed from sale and speculators took over, selling the tariff from 1.5k to 3k (peak of popularity). <br>  I got my O'Light from my brother, because  He was given a corporate sim card.  Then the time came when the megaphone transferred everything into rubles and 3 cents became about 87 kopecks, which is not bad either, compared to the other participants of the ‚Äúbig three‚Äù they asked for about 2.5 rubles, then the time came when they canceled the fee for incoming calls from city ‚Äã‚Äãphones and the cost per minute of conversation raised right up to 1.2 rubles.  Not much raised, just 1 cent.  Then the tariff went to the archive and it was impossible to go to it at all. <br>  So I lived with this Olayt for several years, until I got a job in a large company, where I was given a corporate tariff.  I didn‚Äôt throw out Simka megafonovskaya, too many people knew the number and I carried 2 phones with me, receiving incoming calls and SMS from a megaphone. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As it turned out later, the megaphone has a clause in the contract (4.15) that obliges you to perform paid actions, otherwise they delete the number.  Here is a part of the conversation with the operator of the company (O - operator): <br>  Me: - Hello, I call my number, and they answer me that he is no longer served, what to do? <br>  A: - dictate your number, please. <br>  I: - 926 ... <br>  A: - yes, your number has been deleted. <br>  I: - How, for what?  After all, I use it? <br>  A: - Yes, but you did not make toll calls for 3 months, so we deleted you. <br>  I: - Why didn't you warn me before disconnecting? <br>  A: - We have 6 million subscribers, and we should not contact everyone. <br>  I: - But you know that I use the number, I receive incoming calls and SMS, Simka is constantly registered in the network and you have a robot that constantly checks less active subscribers.  I need my number and my data plan. <br>  A: - I think the number can be returned to you if you write a statement in one of our offices, but the tariff plan will not be returned to you, because it is in the archive. <br>  Me: - It turns out that you turn off all of them and then you already understand?  You are not a customer-oriented company? <br>  A: - As I said, we can not call everyone. <br><br>  So I understand Megaphone began to fight with a freebie, at the first opportunity to take it.  Let them take the number, now my attitude towards the megaphone has changed for the worse. </div>
