"Nanosoft" excites, does not allow to fall asleep in a series of known, understandable and predictable.  "Shakes the hall", as they would say about the star of the native scene or a visiting celebrity.  Software developer "shakes room"?  Imagine, yes.  And his room - the whole country.  And the country is pumping nanoCAD: according to statistics, every 100th citizen has already done so.  Over the past autumn, NANOCAD SHOW was visited by 1,750 designers in 18 cities of Russia, and there are almost as many new meetings ahead.  Span - from the Far East to Kaliningrad.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wp/oa/b9/wpoab9_qcex4vtwgbzdknhocnry.jpeg"><br><br>  Tours stepped over the temporary equator.  How does a star feel?  The star feels great.  Travels, new meetings and friends, almost fans - the best cure for fatigue.  The public interest ignites the desire to please the ‚Äúhall‚Äù as much as possible: to imprint on the retina, ring in the ears, catch on and stay to live in neural networks, not to tire, but to surprise. <br><br>  Russian software developer has become a star? .. Media person?  Why not.  They also warned: something fundamentally new, fresh format.  Who has already been to NANOCAD SHOW - appreciated.  The show dictates the genre rules.  Should not be bored under any.  ‚ÄúAll in three hours, the guests also participate in the show and win‚Äù - the show‚Äôs slogans say.  The market dictates the genre.  The desire to become special among CAD mastodons requires not only technological "elbows", but also great PR-ingenuity, precise movements.  There were a lot of precise movements during the road show.  This is in itself a fun fact - a show from a CAD developer.  Be alert, user!  Some people dressed up in a yellow jersey in the race for our attention.  A little more - and the word "fashionable" will appear. <br><blockquote>  - Fashionable CAD-developer ... How much is it about you?  - analyzing the impressions from NANOCAD SHOW ‚ÄúExpanding the boundaries‚Äù, we asked the director of the company ‚ÄúNanosoft‚Äù Maxim Egorov.  - Can technology be fashionable? <br><br>  - ‚ÄúFashionable‚Äù is an interesting word ... ‚ÄúNanosoft‚Äù is already well known in Russia.  Popularity is growing, primarily due to the need for our products and the fact that we, more than others, manage to respond to a technological inquiry.  At this stage, it seemed important to us that nanoCAD sympathized with human beings or something ... If you want, this desire to show that people work for people.  We have a great team, a good creative atmosphere.  That is what we wanted to share.  It turns out that the IT-company is fighting not only for users (after all, this is a business), but for sympathy and a warm attitude towards itself.  Yes, we want to be chosen by the heart, not just the head.  The search for the human in the most technologically advanced brand.  Hence the openness and availability of our technical support, the ability to work a lot and patiently with users.  If we talk about our show, we deliberately tried to make it lively and original.  You know, sometimes it seems to me that in terms of resources this was comparable to a different technological development.  Only other tools and another way of applying force. </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-k/oa/xm/-koaxm9sns4s70miogm0kbvjafo.jpeg"><br>  <i>Maxim Egorov, General Director of Nanosoft</i> <br><br>  It seems that the creators of the show managed to strike a balance between the technological novelty of the content and the ease in the nature of the action itself.  No lengths, no random presentations, or, God forbid, reports.  A lot of jingo jokes, a lot of jokes, a lot of warmth and turning towards the hall.  Soft and unobtrusive contact with the participants, the desire to see them better, to show that the interest is mutual.  They, the creators of the show, really seriously puzzled by the questions: ‚ÄúWhy do engineers go to events?  Does a designer always have to be serious? ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2v/26/zu/2v26zue2hjvgxpeoiozohvab158.jpeg"><br><br>  The hall responds.  In one of the reviews (look in social networks on # NANOCADSHOW), for example, they write like this: ‚Äú... the event is really worth the attention of engineers from all major areas.  The show in Ufa was impressive and not boring.  The program is rich and bright, all the available functionality of the nanoCAD is illuminated, the work of the latest innovations and what is about to be released has been demonstrated.  Gifts to all - it will be remembered for a long time.  Fun (the most lively meeting of which I was), did not save on a coffee break, a comfortable room in a place of interest. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/g8/sm/kv/g8smkv0jisxhbckrojbyv4rjnmg.jpeg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wn/vp/b2/wnvpb2pguv9v8vr0jq-ijxaaaqa.jpeg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rh/lg/lv/rhlglvkeyaai0ixsdgec7dwfdfi.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  Did the authors of the show realize their plan? </h3>  While it is difficult to say about all the parameters, because half of the cities are still waiting for the show.  Plans for the number of participants strongly overlapped.  St. Petersburg and Moscow record numbers;  in million-plus cities the number of participants steadily exceeded one hundred.  More than 200 posts in social networks on # NANOCADSHOW.  Ahead is your city: <a href="http://show.nanocad.ru/">Nizhny Novgorod, Perm, Kaliningrad, Krasnodar, Rostov-on-Don, Volgograd, Belgorod, Kursk, Yaroslavl, Almaty, Astana</a> .  For other regions created a <a href="http://show.nanocad.ru/">virtual form of participation</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qr/io/f-/qriof-aqhzdf3aws8np1q3eil1k.jpeg"><br><br>  People who have already visited a CAD show, leave feedback, share their impressions with colleagues.  The spectrum of shades of perception is wide, this is normal.  If you, while struggling with skepticism, still ponder, then we recall a few reference points on which the action will be built.  There are always those who do not like surprises and want to get a clear description of the upcoming event.  So let us remind you, and again we will tell those interested that the performances of the Nanosoft team cover the following topics: <br><br><ul><li>  The whole truth about the nanoCAD core </li><li>  Announcements of new products: <a href="http://www.nanocad.ru/products/nanocad-3dscan/">nanoCAD Clouds of points 1.0</a> and <a href="http://www.nanocad.ru/products/nanocad-plus/updates/">nanoCAD Plus 8.5</a> </li><li>  Why do we spend 250 million rubles a year to develop </li><li>  Is there a Russian BIM or is it a myth </li><li>  Life hacking for the daily work of an engineer in nanoCAD </li><li>  DWG, IFC, work with raster substrates, 3D navigation, point clouds </li><li>  3D-design of industrial facilities based on Model Studio CS </li><li>  Import substitution </li><li>  How to make money with nanoCAD </li></ul><br>  Ten live demonstrations in three hours with a short break, gifts and surprises, lively sharing atmosphere, content density and novelty.  Topics of the first row, the most recent and new from the developer of the Russian CAD platform. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xj/qv/wr/xjqvwre61ofrigylrfczkuryui0.jpeg"><br>  <i>Olga Kutuzova, Development Specialist for Regulatory and Technical Documentation Systems, Nanosoft CJSC</i> <br><br><h3>  Let's go to the details </h3><br><ul><li>  Noteworthy is the work with the DWG-format.  This is one of the platform chips.  The technology has acquired useful and pleasant functions in the section of fonts, cleaning drawings, significantly improved and simplified save and transfer operations. </li><li>  Going further - compliance with domestic standards.  nanoCAD was originally developed for Russian standards and projects.  He did not adapt to them in the course of market promotion, as it happens with Western systems, but tune in to them in its root, at the core.  Working in contact with users, whom the Nanosoft team calls collaborators, has the effect of maximizing the wishes of our designers.  This is implemented including in the openness of the platform for any custom modifications. </li><li>  Open API is a springboard for your creativity if you want.  Perhaps your interest will expand so much that you will become a part of the Nanosoft team, and first you will join the <a href="http://developer.nanocad.ru/">nanoCAD developers club</a> .  Since 2011, when the nanoCAD software interface was opened, about 4,000 people registered with the club.  As a rule, these are not professional programmers, but designers who create small utilities for automating routine in their own work.  Of these utilities written for themselves, many commercial products have grown. </li><li>  You will start with the developers club - and you will not have time to notice how you will find yourself in the same boat with those who develop the platform from the inside.  That is, become an employee of "Nanosoft".  About the possibility of such a development of events speak at each meeting of the company. </li><li>  On the show, of course, you will not see the team in full force.  But the key figures you will remember. <br>  Dmitry Popov, one of the pioneers of the company, created a unique presentation about Vernadsky's noosphere, its real incarnation, and security in fragile permeable glass houses with transparent borders, which are information technologies.  The fact that the economy is almost completely dependent on information technology, and without the beloved CAD system, nothing will be built, nothing will go and take off.  About the risks and sanctions, about the transition of the public sector to the domestic software and about how nanoCAD turns out to be a lifeline, all of whose products are already in the Register of domestic software.  The conclusion is simple: develop your own - this is import substitution.  The user receives a professional tool at a lower price, and the money that he paid for this tool remains in the country and will be used, among other things, to pay Russian programmers.  It seems to us that this thought should warm those who go to the show to look at the team, perhaps, as the future place for the application of their talents. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0c/k2/f5/0ck2f5e1adz-w8sk7abotvi8poe.jpeg"><br><ul><li>  Remember the main slogan of the show - "Expanding boundaries"?  We have already told about the fact that in the format of the show the heroes of our story really pulled apart these borders.  But the most skeptical skeptic will say - and where is the technological innovation?  Indeed, nanoCAD is just a tool for the development and release of working documentation, however, now with the functions of universal three-dimensional design, navigation in three-dimensional space, import of various data.  But the Nanosoft team also has two new areas that are, in fact, the leading edge of science and human thought, tied to the tasks of design.  The point is that in the future will significantly change the design system.  This three-dimensional scanning and the magical world of working with clouds of points.  If you get to the place where the show is taking place, you will learn that the navigation tools offered by the nanoCAD platform (free orbit, passage, span), as well as special tools for processing point clouds, help to deal with the huge array of spatial data. </li><li>  BIM - oh, how many in this word for the designer ... completely confused.  On the show you will be presented with a completely sober look, they will clear the debris of perception, they will cure from illusions.  And while not tired!  That's what matters.  Details stop on engineering BIM.  Dmitry Shchurov, creating his report, did not begin to talk about the diversity of views on BIM.  He shared the concept of "Nanosoft".  It is worthwhile to come at least to ask your sharp questions if you disagree.  Not everything that is said from the scene in the framework of even a dull show, you have to humbly swallow.  Go and ask the developers how in your project office to implement the BIM technology on the nanoCAD platform.  Let them answer specific questions.  Be cocky with cocky. <br>  By the way, a real project made using BIM technology will be shown, one of the last.  In residential construction.  They will have time to talk about the tools for designing in industrial construction.  The Russian integrated three-dimensional design system Model Studio CS is one of the favorite creations of the group of companies.  Nanosoft managed to cover all stages of the life cycle of an object: design, construction, operation.  Using Model Studio CS allows you to implement a variety of projects: from simple installations to factories and processing plants. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/do/zm/39/dozm39zesj6gkgb94wqe6isqdm4.jpeg"><br><br><ul><li>  In this place, the program will be interesting even ardent opponents "Nanosoft".  To watch this story to the end, you are welcome to the show, where the seriousness is mixed with a joke, engineering thought moves freely and is capable of self-irony, where you will definitely be pleased with something special. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lp/3e/ca/lp3ecac9zktwnuuikkobbk5nwna.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  And most importantly... </h3>  Already at 14:00 you will be completely free and full of energy (and not as usual after conferences). <br><br>  Already announced <a href="http://show.nanocad.ru/">schedule nanoCAD SHOW 2018</a> : Nizhny Novgorod, Perm, Kaliningrad, Krasnodar, Rostov-on-Don, Volgograd, Belgorod, Kursk, Yaroslavl, Almaty, Astana.  Do not wait for the places to end, it will happen faster than you think. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/nanocad%25D1%2588%25D0%25BE%25D1%2583/"># NANOCADSHOW</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/345132/">https://habr.com/ru/post/345132/</a></p>
