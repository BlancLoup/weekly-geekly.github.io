Immediately set myself a few mandatory characteristics that must be implemented in the new device. <br><br>  1) Diagonal: 22 to 26 inches.  Of course, I wanted more, but space is limited.

      2) Wi-Fi module for playing content from network storage.  In his role is the NETGEAR WNR3500L router with the Tomato firmware, which runs the Transmission torrent client, FTP, Samba and DLNA server.  After all, it is much nicer at dinner to see a freshly downloaded series of the Theory of the Big Bang than to stick into House 2 interspersed with advertising. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I began to study Yandex.market and was surprised to find that none of the manufacturers, except Sony, had realized the ability to connect a small diagonal to the TV network.  All models with network connectivity start at 32 inches.  The choice is great here.  I also had to choose from three (KDL-22EX320, KDL-24EX320, KDL-26EX320) Sony models.  All of them are completely identical in characteristics, the difference is only in the size of the screen.  Although not only in size.  With some fright in the 26 inch model, the resolution is 1366x768, and in 24 inch 1920x1080.  Where is the logic?  Because of this, stopped at 24EX320. <br><br><h5>  Wi-Fi: 802.11n </h5><br>  We are technically savvy people who know that there are several Wi-Fi standards in nature.  The most common is b \ g \ n.  For some reason, this was not indicated on the product page on Yandex.Market and on the <a href="http://www.sony.ru/product/tv-61-24-lcd/kdl-24ex320">official Sony website</a> .  Simply stated that Wi-fi is.  And what he is no longer clear.  How come?  In my opinion on the official website of the manufacturer should be given full technical information.  I am writing to Sony support (info@sony.ru) and get the answer: <br><br>  Good day! <br>  First of all, let me thank you for contacting us and for your interest in SONY products. <br>  We inform you that the built-in wi-fi module on the KDL-24EX320 TV does not support the n standard. <br><br>  Well, here we are: (2012 is in the yard. My entire home technical zoo (which is not the very first freshness), consisting of Macbook laptops, Asus F8, Sony Vaio Z11, Google Nexus One phone and Samsung Galaxy Tab tablet has Wi-Fi n The router has n only mode of operation for greater performance. I had to accept the fact that it would be necessary to change the mode to Auto. <br><br><h5>  Specifications, unboxing, testing </h5><br>  For seed the most interesting specifications <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2f5/da2/a43/2f5da2a43c19e5b39701cfd46ca32852.png"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.sony.ru/product/tv-61-24-lcd/kdl-24ex320">Here</a> you can read the works of marketers on additional features like the "X-Reality Image Processor" and other dregs.  Skopipistyu the most internesnoe: <br><br>  1) Video call and voice calls via Skype ‚Ñ¢ <br>  2) Record TV shows on an external hard drive <br>  3) Save energy and money thanks to the presence sensor <br>  4) Automatically adjust screen brightness to save power <br>  5) Play video and music, as well as view photos via USB <br>  6) Control TV through free applications for smartphones <br><br>  In the box was the TV itself, stand, bullets, remote control and batteries.  Quickly attached the stand to the TV with two screws and put it in its proper place.  Appearance turned out at Sony very good.  Looks expensive and solid.  For the design put definitely five! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/253/90e/95a/25390e95aad699b69a9a542ce63aece0.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Analog TV, Network, DLNA, Browser, Skype, YouTube </h5><br>  I also really liked the menu interface.  It works quickly, without delay.  Completely Russified and quite logical. <br>  To start, I run an automatic scan of analog broadcast.  No problem are all the necessary channels.  In the menu, they can be conveniently and quickly swapped and give a name.  The only negative - the name of the channel is limited to 8 characters.  Therefore, my favorite Discovery did not fit the letter Y. <br>  Separately, I want to highlight the quality of the screen.  After all, on the TV is one of the main criteria.  Here you can safely put the top five.  Just great viewing angles, a good supply of brightness.  It is very difficult to describe the quality of the image with words, but believe me, it is worthy! <br><br>  We turn to the most interesting - connecting to a wireless network.  The process is fast, without problems.  And now available video lying on the server.  Check TV omnivorous formats. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fee/bdc/656/feebdc656e969ed75f7b6df080566318.jpg"><br><br>  First, I tested it on serials, where one file weighs about 350 megabytes. <br>  AVI (MPEG-4 Visual) 720x400 1998 Kbps - excellent <br>  MKV (AVC) 720x400 1546 Kbps - excellent <br>  MPEG-PS (MPEG) 704x576 Kbps - excellent <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/825/d5d/570/825d5d570984cbf543cb58efbb23d006.jpg"><br><br>  But then there was a Fail.  Since the TV supports Full HD decided to give it something more serious.  To do this, specifically downloaded the movie Cars 2 weighing 21.0 GB (BDAV, 1920x1080 AVC 35.5 Mbit / s) and the Rise of the Planet of the Apes 7 GB (MKV, 1280x 544 AVC 9140 Kbps.) <br><br>  In the folder where these videos lay, I saw the inscription "There are no items to display."  I went to FTP, I checked the files on the spot.  Just in case, launched Rescan files on the server.  The result is one "No items to display."  It dawned on me - after all, my Galaxy Tab tablet is also friends with DLNA.  I go - all okay.  Video on the spot. <br>  The sad result, to start these films failed.  I do not know why, Sony TV felts scared a large file size, the stars so we got up.  But it is a fact. <br><br>  Further, during operation, a rather bad ‚Äúomnivorousness‚Äù of the device was revealed.  I did not search for my favorite codecs (for TV) and containers.  For you have to immediately download them or convert. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/10b/cd9/3de/10bcd93de474cf63bcb4280e3e792ec7.jpg"><br><br>  The browser does not work very fast.  The only fast-working resource is bash.org.ru :) If there is a lot of graphics on the page and complex formatting is a pipe.  Plus typing the URL from the TV remote is not the most convenient exercise.  Although one can bookmark sites of interest once and easily call them.  I made myself a page with Yandex Weather and Yandex Traffic Jams.  Now you can watch how the latter slows down. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d04/aa1/7d1/d04aa17d11dfe76ff4c13069641bc1f3.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/601/06f/dfa/60106fdfad9e234c330e681d8db62f77.jpg"><br><br>  The YouTube client is of a high standard.  All standard chips like search and comments work.  For those who do not know.  On Youtube there is a channel <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Soyuzmult%3Fblend%3D3%26ob%3D5">‚ÄúOur favorite cartoons‚Äù</a> , where almost all old cartoons from Soyuzmultfilm are completely free and legally posted.  Now we feed the child under this channel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/23a/e4d/1d6/23ae4d1d6272589362af56b59832e183.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Skype </h5><br>  A small ambush awaits here.  Fully (video and voice communication) can be used only with the purchase of an optional accessory <a href="http://www.sony.ru/product/tv-61-24-lcd/kdl-24ex320">‚ÄúBuilt-in camera and microphone for BRAVIA¬Æ TVs with Skype ‚Ñ¢ support‚Äù</a> This ‚Äútrick‚Äù is worth as much as 5,000 rubles.  And another non-original webcam can not be connected.  In principle, this is the usual policy of Sony, the other I did not expect.  Buy our accessories!  =) <br><br><h5>  Sony remote </h5><br>  I quickly found this softphone in the open spaces of the Android Market and put it on the tablet.  The first launch enters into a stupor.  First, the application is not adapted for large screens and does not run Full Screen.  Kindergarten.  Secondly infuriated advertising banner in the application.  For some reason I think that I already paid for the TV.  Surely such a megacorporation, like Sony, counts pennies and makes money on ad displays =) Not solid and not serious.  My opinion - the application is made for the tick "to be."  Demolished <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9b4/478/1f5/9b44781f53170cc22aedafe880edf745.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Summary </h5><br>  When buying, I naively believed that this unit is a multimedia processor of my dreams.  Four months have passed since the purchase.  We can say that I regret overpaid money for all those ‚Äúnetwork buns‚Äù that I have pecked at.  Surf through the built-in browser is possible only with steel nerves.  Movie playback on the network works through time.  It would be better to buy a separate device any omnivorous media player.  Only Youtube client did not disappoint :) <br><br><h5>  Pros: </h5><br>  1) Stylish appearance <br>  2) Good screen <br>  3) It's a Sony :) <br><br><h5>  Minuses: </h5><br>  1) The price against the other 24 inch models does not look very appetizing <br>  2) Problems with DLNA <br>  3) No Wi-Fi standard n <br><br>  Lastly, several different photos. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/af3/fa7/16f/af3fa716f27889e69777e1793a3831fe.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/298/ce8/97e/298ce897e9181b488e561afb378940c3.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8aa/7a9/638/8aa7a9638da0b50be30bff246b36b629.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dba/89e/477/dba89e477c601c521c99d92aa30de7ef.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d85/0ee/11a/d850ee11a03097cb1a543b1765274a55.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a53/666/3e0/a536663e0f3744cccd151f9a4b1451c9.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e4e/600/daa/e4e600daa9e5517cb19dbfe93bbb068b.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/140267/">https://habr.com/ru/post/140267/</a></p>
