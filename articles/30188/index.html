  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Microphones, microphones and microphones again. Part 1</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The question of choosing a microphone for podcasting, according to the frequency of setting covers all the others, taken together.  And although this process is very intimate, and the microphone is good for me may seem completely inappropriate for your voice and your conditions, I still decided to write this note and list those microphones with which I had to deal and which I have something to say. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  1. <a href="http://www.rodemic.com/microphone.php%3Fproduct%3DPodcaster"><strong>R0DE Podcaster</strong></a> - the manufacturer calls this device ‚ÄúBroadcast Quality USB Microphone‚Äù and I can subscribe to each of these 4 words.  Yes, that's exactly the case - the quality of a real radio microphone, durability and reliability of performance and amazing ease of use.  Strictly speaking, calling it a microphone is not entirely accurate.  In essence, this is a podcaster-individual studio that can be connected to USB USB (Windows and Mac are supported) and to which headphones can be connected for zero-latency monitoring.  At the moment, this is the device that I offer as a complete solution for new podcasters.  Very worthy and in terms of simplicity and results.  It seems to me that it is quite suitable for almost all types of voices, except that I didn‚Äôt really like the sound of a very high female voice in this device.  Yes, and this is a dynamic microphone in spite of the fact that on many sites it is called a condenser microphone. <br><br>  An extra shock mount is highly recommended for this microphone, and for some speaking styles either a windscreen or pop filter may be needed.

      Issue price from $ 160 to $ 250.  TTX is also at the level of: <br><ul><li>  Broadcast Sound Quality </li><li>  28mm dynamic capsule </li><li>  18-bit resolution, 8-48kHz sampling </li><li>  Windows and Mac compatible </li><li>  Powered by USB bus </li><li>  Internal capsule shock mounting </li><li>  3.5mm stereo headphone output with volume control built-in to body </li></ul><br>  A detailed <a href="http://www.podcastim.ru/2008/07/obzor-mikrofona-rode-podcaster/">review of this microphone</a> can be found at <a href="http://www.podcastim.ru/">podcastim.ru</a> <br><br>  2. <a href="http://www.shure.com/ProAudio/Products/WiredMicrophones/us_pro_SM58-CN_content"><strong>Shure SM58</strong></a> - professional dynamic directional microphone, which has become the standard and is the most popular among vocalists around the world.  SM58 has a lively and clear sound, unique durability and reliability.  Its smoothly rising mid-range response and the bass on the bass give maximum power and energy, with a minimum of bubbling on both male and female vocals.  The disadvantage on the one hand, but dignity on the other, is a very pronounced proximty effect, which adds a low level when speaking close.  Personally, he seems to me more suitable for medium and high (in frequency) votes.  The female voice he conveys is especially beautiful.  A good wind-filter or pop-filter is very important for this microphone.  Shock mount also does not hurt, but is not so mandatory.  In this microphone, you can successfully speak even holding it in your hands. <br><br>  He has a standard connector for prof.  microphones (XLR).  I would not recommend connecting this farm to the microphone input of your computer, although sometimes it will somehow work. <br><br>  Price microphone up to $ 99, can be found in the region of $ 80.  Unfortunately, a lot of Chinese fakes, apparently very similar but sounding irreproachable.  It seems to me that such a microphone is worth having on the farm.  For some, it may well serve as the main / sole, and for someone as a guest / exit / reserve.  I had 2 such microphones, one of which is still used for some special cases, and I gave the second one to a beginning podaster. <br><ul><li>  Frequency response tailored for vocals, with brightened midrange and bass rolloff </li><li>  Uniform cardioid pickup pattern </li><li>  Pneumatic shock-mount system cuts down noise </li><li>  Effective, built-in spherical wind and pop filter </li><li>  With rotates 180 degrees </li><li>  Legendary Shure quality, ruggedness and reliability </li><li>  Cardioid (unidirectional) dynamic </li><li>  Frequency response: 50 to 15,000 Hz </li></ul><br><br>  3. <strong><a href="http://www.samsontech.com/products/productpage.cfm%3Fprodid%3D1879">Samson Q1U USB Dynamic</a></strong> - Dynamic USB microphone.  Unlike R0DE, Podcaster does not have a built-in headphone amplifier and, as a result, does not allow monitoring the recording in real time by hearing that is a huge disadvantage for me personally.  Very well made, strong and reliable.  It sounds rather mediocre, but by post-processing it is possible to draw out quite a listenable sound.  The main advantage in my opinion is the low price - from $ 40 to $ 70.  The effect of close speaking is not as pronounced as in sm58, but much less pleasant to hear.  In one of the TiPZ I tried to make a normal sound out of this microphone.  You can <a href="http://tipz.umputun.com/podcasts/tip-zvuka-4-zhivoj-eksperiment/">listen to what happened</a> . <br><ul><li>  Dynamic Handheld Microphone with USB interface </li><li>  Plugs USB input </li><li>  High Quality A / D Converter with 16-Bit, 48kHz Sampling Rate </li><li>  Super Cardioid Pickup Pattern </li><li>  Compatible with any Computer Based Digital Audio Workstation </li><li>  Tripod desk stand and carry pouch included </li></ul><br><br>  4. <a href="http://www.audio-technica.com/cms/wired_mics/53b8b7998922fb02/index.html"><b>Audio Technica AT3035</b></a> - Large Diaphragm Condenser Microphone.  The release is discontinued, but it is still possible to buy it at a good price.  It occurs for $ 120- $ 200.  Despite its condenser nature, it is quite convenient for podcasting.  I used such a microphone for quite a long time and in my, not the quietest studio, I managed to get a noise of less than -42 at a signal level of -3. <br><br>  It sounds beautifully and smoothly, at almost all frequencies, and it seems to me quite suitable for any voice.  Built-in bass suppressor copes with pop effects and with this microphone there is no need for a pop filter.  Shock Mount, on the other hand, is highly recommended!  (in the US stores it is included with this microphone). <br><br>  For my taste, in this microphone there is little ‚Äúdrive‚Äù and some aggression.  However, what seems like a disadvantage to my case, for expressive and emotional voices, it can be a virtue. <br><br>  The condenser nature of this microphone causes, on the one hand, the need for phantom power, but on the other hand, not very high gain requirements. <br><ul><li>  Custom-engineered large diaphragm for exceptional detail and low noise </li><li>  Slow motion of the desired sound source </li><li>  High max SPL, unmatched versatility </li><li>  Low self-noise (12 dB SPL) - perfectly suited for today's most sophisticated digital recording equipment </li><li>  Extended low-frequency response for rich, full sound </li><li>  ATs stringent state consistency and reliability standards </li><li>  Custom shock mount provides superior isolation </li><li>  Lo-cut switch (80 Hz, 12 dB / octave) and 10 dB pad </li></ul><br><br>  At this point, the review of microphones in the context of our narrow podcaster interests is not at all completed, but in fact has just begun.  The plans are still a notable number of different microphones awaiting their review.  In short, to be continued ... <br><br>  * Original notes on the <a href="http://tipz.umputun.com/articles/mikrofony-mikrofony-i-eshhe-raz-mikrofony-chast-1/">Theory and Practice of Sound Recordings</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/30188/">https://habr.com/ru/post/30188/</a></p>
