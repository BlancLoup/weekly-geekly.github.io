And it is very important when working with various trifles.  Network soldering iron always dissipates the same power.  That is, if it lies on the spot, it can even heat up to 500 degrees, and when you begin to solder, it sharply cools. <br><br>  On the other hand, if a thermocouple is built into the soldering iron, you can arrange feedback.  This makes it possible to regulate the power on the heater in order to maintain a stable temperature. <br><br>  Our goal was to develop a soldering station based on a common and cheap soldering iron with a thermocouple.  It has the following characteristics: <br><br><ol><li>  Powered by a DC voltage source of 12-24V </li><li>  Power consumption, with 24V power: 50W </li><li>  Soldering iron resistance: 12Œ© </li><li>  Time of an exit to an operating mode: 1-2 minutes depending on the feeding tension </li><li>  Maximum deviation of temperature in the stabilization mode, not more than 5 degrees </li><li>  Regulation algorithm: PID </li><li>  Temperature display on a seven-segment display </li><li>  Heater type: nichrome </li><li>  Type of temperature sensor: thermocouple </li><li>  Temperature calibration capability </li><li>  Temperature setting with encoder </li><li>  LED to display the status of the soldering iron (heating / work) </li></ol><br><h2>  Printed circuit board </h2><br>  The board is double-sided, but adapted for manufacturing at home.  At the end of the article you will find a link to the file for SprintLayout. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/f8/kg/xv/f8kgxvadldht9trsk6fcefcrsp0.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/iy/ux/jv/iyuxjv_s0k5szunzmxpnodg2t_y.jpeg"><br><br>  If you are interested in the scheme of the device, you can find it <a href="http://www.customelectronics.ru/simple_solder_mk936/">here</a> .  On it, only the reference designations of the elements and the pin numbers of the microcontroller differ.  In fact, everything is done on the Atmega8 microcontroller, to which a seven-segment indicator, an encoder, a heater through a switch and a signal from a thermocouple, amplified by an operational amplifier, are connected. <br><br><h2>  Component List </h2><br>  The following components and materials will be required to assemble the circuit board and case: <br><br><ol><li>  BQ1.

Install elements on the board according to the list of elements.  When installing elements, it is important to follow the orientation of the tantalum capacitors and the operational amplifier.  The first output of DA2 is determined by the bevel on the body. <br><br>  If everything is assembled correctly, the board should look like this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7h/we/as/7hweasjoopf4m9u7njy07p91njy.jpeg"><br><br>  Please note that we used 1kOhm resistors without marking. <br>  Next, you need to install the output elements on the board in accordance with the list of elements.  Long LED output is a plus.  The seven-segment indicator is set ‚Äúpoints‚Äù down. <br><br>  Here is the front side of the PCB assembly: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wd/t6/va/wdt6vadhahsykkrpmyj_ao4sswa.jpeg"><br><br><h2>  Assembly of the case and volume installation </h2><br>  Power and soldering iron are connected according to the following scheme: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/we/s7/yt/wes7ytg1pn5j-61omgny30qvxn0.png"><br><br>  Before assembling the case, it is necessary to prepare a switch and a connector.  The switch must be connected to the break of the red wire so that on one contact of the switch there is a short piece of red thick wire, and on the second a long one. <br><br>  You need to connect short red wires to the first and fifth pins of the soldering iron connector, and the rest to black. <br><br>  Heat-shrink tubing should be worn on the switch and the connector and tinned all the free ends of the wires, so that later it was more convenient to fasten them to the terminals. <br><br>  Next, you need to install a switch and a soldering iron connector on the front panel.  Please note that the switch may be installed tightly and it may be necessary to modify the slot for it with a file. <br><br>  Then you should connect the first pin of the connector to the first pin of the board, the second to the second, and so on.  in accordance with the above figure.  The power supply on the board must be connected to the red short wire from the switch, and to the minus the black wire. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4w/2s/i3/4w2si3xqeunlxlr5ziz4rmwfzwg.jpeg"><br><br><h2>  Microcontroller firmware and first start </h2><br>  In the upper left corner of the board there is a standard ISP connector for flashing AVR microcontrollers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oz/xr/vy/ozxrvynybwolbyls-tb3qmg5lm4.jpeg"><br><br>  You can flash the microcontroller with any programmer you have, for example USBasp.  If the programmer provides power itself supplies 5V, then connect the external is not required.  You can also find the firmware file at the end of the article. <br><br>  <b>Configuration bits!</b>  <b>You must enable CKSEL0, CKSEL2, CKSEL3, SUT0, BOOTSZ0, BOOTSZ1 and SPIEN!</b>  That is, a change of default settings is required to start the controller at a clock frequency of 2 MHz. <br><br>  Now you can connect a soldering iron and supply the input supply voltage (from 12 to 24V).  After switching on, the soldering iron should start to heat up, and the temperature reading on the indicator should increase.  When the encoder shaft rotates, the value of the required temperature should change. <br><br><h2>  Completion of assembly </h2><br><oembed>  Now you can screw the board to the front panel.  It is allowed to use conventional racks with a height of 10 mm, but we have prepared special racks that provide better fixation of the board.  A model for 3D printing can also be found at the end of the article. </oembed><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/09/dz/vk/09dzvkrumiblklwefx4khiagwr0.jpeg"><br><br>  Side walls are installed without any mounts.  Now it remains only to insert the rear cover into the grooves, tighten the nuts, pull the power wires through the hole and fix them with cable clamps.  <b>Remember that the plexiglass parts are quite fragile and do not overtighten the fasteners!</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7r/bp/rn/7rbprnnalgxlgxfvthbie0saefu.jpeg"><br><br><h2>  Calibration </h2><br>  For precise temperature adjustment using a trimmer resistor.  The front panel has a special opening for access to it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lz/z5/30/lzz530k9obtzatqu3x7ymtnygeq.jpeg"><br><br>  When calibrating, first of all it is necessary to bring the sting to the temperature at which the solder melts.  You can just set the encoder very high temperature immediately.  Then, having collected a solder ball on a sting, it is required to warm up the thermocouple.  There are special measuring devices for such purposes, but an ordinary multimeter with a thermocouple will do.  Next, by rotating the trimming shaft, ensure that the measured value of the soldering station matches the readings of the external thermocouple. <br><br>  During calibration, remember that the more time you give a soldering iron to stabilize the temperature, the more accurately you will be able to adjust it.  Also note that the trimmer is multi-loop and one revolution changes the temperature very slightly.  That is, you need to turn it boldly and a lot. <br><br><h2>  Video </h2><br>  We also prepared a video instruction: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MQtV9PRmekk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h2>  Links </h2><br>  Direct links to all the necessary files for downloading can be found on the <a href="http://www.customelectronics.ru/simple_solder_mk936_smd/">main page of the project</a> . <br><br>  This device also has a version on a one-sided board using only pin components.  Find it <a href="https://habr.com/company/makeitlab/blog/373095/">here</a> <br><br>  Once again I want to emphasize that we provide all the necessary and very detailed information for the independent production of this device, and additionally we provide the opportunity to purchase it in the form of a set ( <a href="https://shop.robotclass.ru/index.php%3Froute%3Dproduct/product%26path%3D62%26product_id%3D1200">one</a> , <a href="http://good-kits.ru/raznoe/simple-solder-mk936-smd---payalnaya-stantsiya-nabor-dlya-sborki/">two</a> , <a href="http://www.shop.customelectronics.ru/">three</a> ). <br><br>  PS: and we are also preparing a hairdryer) thanks for your interest in our activities! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/417471/">https://habr.com/ru/post/417471/</a></p>
