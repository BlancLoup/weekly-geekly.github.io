  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Business lunch at Tanki Online, or a few words about bundles</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Come lunchtime.  You go to the nearest restaurant and order a business lunch for yourself: salad, soup, hot and always compote.  You return to work, finish the working day and go to the gym, you have, of course, an annual subscription, it is more profitable than the monthly one.  Bulk is always cheaper.  In this article we want to talk about how we use the mechanics of kits (bundles) in the game ‚ÄúTanks Online‚Äù: what KPI we are guided by, what principles we are guided by and what difficulties we encountered. <br><br>  Bandla - a very good thing from any point of view.  I remember that at my first job I preferred to always take lunch with me.  So profitable, and even my mother's kitchen - the most delicious and healthy in the world.  The situation changed when colleagues suggested that I go to a business lunch.  For two hundred rubles, I ate plenty of small portions of various dishes.  Soon he refused from his mother's kitchen and began to eat only business lunches.  ‚ÄúSo profitable,‚Äù I concluded again.  Speaking of game devil, I converted to a donator.  <b>The first advantage of bundles is an increase in conversion to a paying user.</b>  A few years later, my first purchase on Steam was also a bundle. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/da5/772/c9b/da5772c9b8191faca0e795af94949569.jpg">

      Speaking of Steam.  You‚Äôve probably ever bought bundles on Steam? <a name="habracut"></a>  Did all the games in these sets then play?  That's it!  For example, I have never listened to the soundtracks from the games that Steam, with stubborn periodicity, shoves into its bundles.  And the addition I install only one of the three purchased.  Bundle is good for the seller because it allows you to increase sales of goods with low demand.  <b>The second advantage of bundles is the illiquid discharge.</b>  And the effect here is as a one-time ‚Äî in fact, an increase in sales, as well as permanent ‚Äî demand creates demand.  Often after the expiration of a bundle, a product that was previously illiquid, spins up and begins to be in demand, primarily due to virality.  I think the creators of the Humble Bundle pursue these goals as well. <br><br>  I will not say for public catering, but we all know that the elasticity of demand for price in geymdev simply rolls over, and even a properly submitted ten percent discount can increase sales at least twice.  <b>The third advantage of bundles is an increase in revenue.</b>  Steam with its discount policy looks like a king here - weekly new attractive offers appear.  At the same time it is very important to show the entire kitchen.  Look: the bundle consists of five games, and if you bought them separately, you would spend X rubles, but in the bundle they cost X / 2, and we will also give you a soundtrack from the game and a card.  And you run to buy, despite the fact that you already have two of these five games - after all, it still benefits you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a09/ab9/f59/a09ab9f59ec7317fa001a1f48726856e.jpg"><br><br>  Bundle is a new item in the store, a new content.  Players are very fond of new content.  Do not believe it - try to add to the store of your game one new knickknack, say, Black Square of Malevich, raising hp exactly 0 points.  The demand for it will pleasantly surprise.  At the same time, the bundle is not a new gun, which must be balanced for a long time and painfully.  This is just welding from existing parts.  <b>Bundles are very simple to implement and always justify their already low production costs.</b> <br><br>  Plus, think about the users.  By making one purchase, no matter how much it costs, they get a bunch of diverse and multi-colored toys, which makes their lives brighter and more diverse.  In the end, the main thing is that the players were fun.  After all, we make our games so that the player is happy, isn't it?  <b>Bundles are user friendly.</b> <br><br>  Several captain principles of bandl formation: <br><ul><li>  a bundle should cost less than all its components separately; </li><li>  a bundle should not be cheaper than its most expensive item; </li><li>  the bundle should be evenly assembled, it should not contain objects that are very different in price in one direction or another; </li><li>  the bundle should be useful to the user, its components should not contradict each other (no substitute products, but no complement products); </li><li>  The pricing principles of the bundle should be shown to the user as transparently as possible; </li><li>  Do not be greedy - the bundle should be cool, and everything else - idle talk. </li></ul><br><br>  And now about how we made bands (in our case - kits) in ‚ÄúTanks Online‚Äù. <br>  We decided that the kit should be primarily user friendly.  By purchasing it, the user gets a finished tank, while with a regular purchase the hull, gun and paint are purchased separately.  The kit also contains everything you need: a gun, a body, paints with resists, as well as several dozen sets of consumables.  Sorting the items, we were not guided by any strict algorithms, instead we manually selected the details one by one, trying to keep a balance between the price of goods, their popularity and just playability.  For example, several paints with low demand were added to super popular cannons and bodies, choosing those colors that would work well and look good on a tank. <br><br>  The first time we released bandla in April 2013.  The goal was only to increase the conversion to Donat, and therefore the kits were designed only for the initial titles.  The kits justified themselves, but gave only a temporary effect, raising DAPU by about 3% for one month.  Then the euphoria subsided, and the effect of entering sets ‚Äúsmeared‚Äù throughout the game content. <br><br>  The experiment was considered successful, and we decided to repeat the success.  At the end of September 2013, new sets appeared in the game, this time for all ranks.  The effect worked very well - the daily number of payers increased by 20%, without dropping the average income on the payer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fcc/7cd/972/fcc7cd97284cf62ac6c1d1a2bbb8a436.jpg"><br><br>  A little more than a month has passed since the release of the kits, and the effect is not going to decrease.  Therefore, we decided to go ahead and launch new kits on a regular basis. <br><br>  Well, now lunchtime.  Bon Appetit everyone! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/200278/">https://habr.com/ru/post/200278/</a></p>
