Many government and commercial organizations are switching to electronic document management and electronic document storage.  In this regard, the need for specialists with relevant knowledge and skills in the field of ECM. <br>  Engineers and programmers should be able to provide the technical side of the issue.  Doktorovedy should know the specifics of electronic document management.  Financiers and economists need to know the subtleties of working with electronic financial documents.  The transition to electronic document management entails changes in legal practice - therefore, there is a need to provide relevant knowledge to future lawyers. <br>  The tasks of teaching ECM course at a higher educational institution can be formulated as follows: first, it is to form students' understanding of the theoretical and methodological foundations of information management, and secondly, to study the specifics of using modern tools and information management methods in specific subject areas. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  When preparing the course, the teacher inevitably raises the question: where to get the materials?  The ECM textbook is practically absent in Russian.  The materials available on the Internet, as a rule, are ‚Äúsharpened‚Äù for quite specific products of specific companies and are poorly suitable for studying at a university.  Therefore, without recourse to foreign sources can not do.  From foreign websites you can pay special attention to the following:

Let me be taught.  Where and who teaches this? <br>  <b>Lecturer and department</b> : We want to teach electronic document management in the native institute.  Where to go, who will help prepare the training course, what software to choose? <br>  <b>Software developer</b> : What are we ready to give to universities?  What benefits will we get from this? <br><br>  <b>Our implementation experience</b> : having enlisted the support of the department, find an IT partner, and better a few. <br><br><h4>  - your suitcase? <br>  - This one without a pen?  My! </h4><br>  Someone inherited apartments and cars, and I got "Electronic document management and payments."  2004, the head of the department with his team of teachers leaves the department, as a matter of urgency, the ‚Äúvacant‚Äù subjects are distributed to the teachers in the department.  By that moment in our company, we have already developed and implemented the <a href="http://www.alee-archive.ru/">ALEE Archive</a> system for our clients for several years (later renamed <a href="http://www.stor-m.ru/">STOR-M</a> ).  But to develop and implement information systems does not mean to be ready to teach them to students. <br><br><h4>  How was gold </h4><br>  Even today on the Russian Internet there is little academic information on the subject, one continuous advertisement.  Foreign resources are certainly richer, but translation and localization for the needs of the university is a tremendous job, requiring a lot of time, special skills and motivation.  In search of something ready, they turned to two companies, EOS and DocsVision, but at that time nothing was offered to us except licenses.  There were no ready-made academic courses or business courses close to them.  Then we turned to Documentum Services Russia, now <a href="http://russia.emc.com/domains/documentum/index.htm">EMC Documentum</a> . <br><br>  A meeting was held with managers responsible for partnership activities and the learning process.  Their main doubt lay in the phrase: "We will wean you, like several university teachers before, and after a while you will dissolve in the fog."  The decisive argument was that our main business lies in the field of electronic document management and we have strong incentives not to minimize the project.  Consent has been obtained. <br><br>  In January 2007, I completed the course on the ‚ÄúDocumentum Technical Basics‚Äù course, 40 hours, the teacher Konstantin Bazhukhov, passed the final exam-test along with all the students (sysadmins and implementers), I had to sweat, but I honestly got the minimum passing score, which left extremely satisfied.  In November 2008, the course "Fundamentals of ECM" + "Implementation of ECM solutions", 40 hours, teacher <a href="http://ecm-discovery.blogspot.com/">Albert Bertyakov</a> .  The course has much in common with the similar AIIMovsky, was localized and significantly complemented by Albert analytics and Russian practice. <br><br><h4>  What happened </h4><br>  The program received from Documentuma was adapted for senior students of specialty 0719 ‚ÄúInformation systems in engineering and technology‚Äù.  Theory ‚ÄúFundamentals of the ECM‚Äù + ‚ÄúImplementation of the ECM solutions‚Äù + ‚ÄúTechnical fundamentals of Documentum‚Äù + ‚ÄúElectronic archive system STOR-M‚Äù + laboratory works, the total course volume is 160 hours.  With the transition to a two-level training course is divided into two: for undergraduate and graduate.  Students gain knowledge and skills that outside the institute can only be obtained for money.  Our graduates are happy to take in the company implementing ECM, not only Documentum and STOR-M. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  Thus, the success factors of this course are: <br>  1. <b>Good theory</b> .  Translation materials, vendor materials, market analytics, experience of implemented projects in our own company. <br>  2. <b>"Correct" software and a full workshop</b> . <br>  3. <b>Related items</b> .  One apple tree is not yet a cherry orchard.  For the full development of a specialist, we read: ‚ÄúDesigning Information Systems‚Äù, ‚ÄúCollecting SRS Requirements‚Äù, ‚ÄúITIL Infrastructure Management ITIL‚Äù and much more. <br>  4. <b>Teacher training</b> .  Self-update materials do not have enough time, periodic courses and seminars are very helpful. <br>  5. <b>Technical support</b> .  It is carried out by its own sysadmin. <br>  6. The <b>work of the teacher in the profile of the subject</b> .  I am the general director of LLC <a href="http://www.alee.ru/">ALEE SOFTWARE</a> introducing electronic archives and <a href="http://www.scandocs.ru/">digitizing documents</a> industrially. <br>  7. <b>Marketing and PR readable course</b> .  I have repeatedly participated in seminars and conferences with EMC Documentum; there is great interest among colleagues and students. <br><br>  Ready to share information with all interested. <br><br>  PS We invite university lecturers to face-to-face and discuss the problems of teaching information technology at <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/events/258/">EMC Academic Forum Russia</a> , which will be held in St. Petersburg on November 21-22.  Places like there is still. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/132474/">https://habr.com/ru/post/132474/</a></p>
