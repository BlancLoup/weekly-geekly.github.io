  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The Future of iPad Web Apps</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  So, the entire Internet community is vigorously discussing the emergence of this wonderful device. <br><img src="http://www.theappleipadtablet.com/apple-ipad-64gb.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Everyone talks about how cool it will be to run on it already familiar applications from the App Store and, in general, everything will be fine.  And what is the situation with web applications?  Want to know?  Then we go under the cut and read the translation of one good article. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <a href="http://www.wolfire.com/">Wolfire</a> writes the <a href="http://blog.wolfire.com/2010/01/Web-applications-on-the-iPad">following</a> in a blog: ‚ÄúToday, Apple announced the iPad and modestly stated that it would shed the golden rain with native apps from the App Store.  Well, great, but what interested me the most is the fact that Apple also created with irony the most promising open platform for web applications that can instantly undermine the success of the App Store. [...] iPad the first device that combines the following characteristics: the ability to run fairly powerful applications, (with high probability) a huge client base, a developed WebKit implementation and a stable 3G Internet.  So, all the dominoes have taken their rightful place and, as it seems to me, the iPad has already brought down the first of the row. ‚Äù <br><br>  And I tend to agree with him.  Let's start with a clear understanding of this: absolutely, the goal of Apple can be considered the desire to make the iPad as successful as they did the iPhone.  Let us now imagine (and some geeks have been thinking only this for a long time) that iPhones and iPads have become the most popular products. <br>  In such a situation, a huge, financially prosperous and influential market mass is formed, which does not have Flash and is unlikely to receive it.  And this is very serious.  You can be sure that Adobe is unlikely to please it.  They sell expensive development tools that will not affect this market in any way, and any more or less knowledgeable web developer will understand that developing on Flash is not so great, since to support iPhone / iPad it‚Äôs easier to write to HTML5 / SVG instead of doing the same job twice. <br><br>  The success of the iPad (and / or ChromeOS) will lead to a change in a large number of habits prevailing in web developers.  So, if company X asks you to make a website, and it does not support the iPhone / iPad, what will make them pay you?  It will be easier for them to hire someone who has an iPhone / iPad skill in his resume. <br>  The absence of Flash means that you cannot distribute Flash videos.  Think about it.  How many sites on which the video is launched using a flash player, do you watch during the day?  All of them will lose their visitors if I can‚Äôt support the iPad.  And all of them will have only one way out - video using HTML5. <br>  And more precisely - the video in H.264 format, since Apple does not support anything else.  And it worries the most.  If you are a medium-sized developer, you have your own website and you want to provide video to iPhone / iPad users, then you simply have to risk using a licensed video codec.  And this in turn means that in 2011 you may knock on guys in <s>gray overcoats,</s> strict suits and will be asked to pay for everything.  Thus, Apple supports only the market sector in which reputable players play.

      What about advertising?  Advertisements constantly use Flash (to the great displeasure of users).  Such advertisements are always created on the assumption that everyone has this Flash.  It is almost omnipresent, although neither Microsoft nor Apple have a hand in its creation.  It is a completely independent plugin and always remained. <br>  I‚Äôm not stealing anything from advertisers if they decide to use another advertising mechanism that I cannot provide.  The iPad does not have Flash support and this has bothered many.  Most sites (or, more precisely, advertising firms) will now have to fight a market group that does not have Flash.  Simply put, how can they provide advertising there!? <br><br>  Well, what's done is done.  If the changes in the use of the mobile Internet, provoked by the iPhone, were just something new, now you should get ready for a huge injection of web applications that have no analogues.  And hardly anyone now ever remembers Internet Explorer.  So get ready for the fact that there is only one true path. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/90310/">https://habr.com/ru/post/90310/</a></p>
