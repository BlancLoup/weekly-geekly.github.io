As far as I know, one of the concepts of this system is the free schedule of work of all company employees.  Like, there is no need here to breed despotism and force everyone to work from 9 to 18 hours.  Maybe a person has a peak of creative activity at 23 o'clock, so let him come to work at 23 o'clock, and his work should be assessed by the results of his work, and not by the number of hours spent in the office. <br><br>  To me, as the head of a firm, these purely theoretical conclusions seem of little use in practice.  More precisely completely inapplicable.  This is worth doing if you need to quickly merge the company and close as soon as possible.  I see no other reason to introduce such a system of work.  At least, at this stage of technical progress, until people communicate mentally at a distance.  According to such a system, a company can work which, by the nature of its activity, does not communicate with customers, nor with partners, nor with suppliers.  A sort of spherical horse in a vacuum.  Let's sort everything out in order. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      I will make a reservation right away, I mean it is a free work schedule, that is, the employee himself decides when to work based on his personal desires, and not guided by the interests of the companies, because in the future we will see that if he is guided by the interests of the company, he will have to work in the schedule from 9 to 18 (plus minus an hour).  We do not consider exceptions here when the company operates in a foreign time zone. <br><br>  The impossibility of working on a free schedule of industrial enterprises is obvious.  For the manufacture of glass, for example, at least two people are required, both must work simultaneously at an agreed time, regardless of each other‚Äôs desires and ‚Äúcreative hours‚Äù.  The same in construction.  If the cement truck driver decides that there are fewer traffic jams in the evening and will come to work after 21 hours, and the bricklayer prefers to work in the morning in the cold, the construction, in my opinion, will not end soon. <br><br>  Perhaps, it is possible to introduce the considered principle in the sphere of services?  Would you go to the grocery store, which does not work on some kind of schedule, but say, at the request of the seller?  Today he slept, opened a shop at 9, tomorrow he decided to go to the country in the morning and the store started working from 19 o'clock.  How long will he last? <br><br>  Any company introducing a free schedule of work of all employees, first of all risks being left without work.  A sensible potential customer, after reading the advertisement, decides to call the company during working hours (it just so happened that everyone once agreed to work from 9 to 18, or about it).  If you don‚Äôt pick up the phone at this time, it‚Äôs unlikely he will guess to call back at 23 o'clock.  Even if you put an answering machine with the text ‚ÄúWe have a free schedule, call up periodically!‚Äù, This will not force him to dial your phone number frantically at half an hour to catch a moment of creativity of your employees.  Most likely, he will find a more adequate company.  Suppliers will not be delighted with the offer to give you material closer to 3 o'clock in the morning.  Just a couple of days, you just will not work with anyone. <br><br>  It turns out that at a strictly defined time, specialists who work with customers, suppliers, banks, technical specialists should work (not always the customer service manager can even understand, and not just to solve the customer's problem), that is, all the personnel of the company, which means along with them and all the leadership, because to lead the missing employees somehow not from the hand.  And employees should start working at 9 o'clock exactly (or at least become available for communication and have access to all the necessary information), because at 9.01 the Most Important Customer can call and everyone should be ready for this.  This is not the despotism of the authorities.  Otherwise, simply can not survive.  The company should work in the first place, as it is convenient to its partners, customers, suppliers.  So that all of them could solve their problems at a convenient time.  Only then the company has a chance to become successful.  And the fact that after a lunch Sereyu, a leading specialist, usually tends to sleep if someone besides a leading specialist Seregi is interested in sleep. <br><br>  PS Of course, there are employees whose work is individual, has a clear deadline and for its successful completion does not require communication with the outside world.  For example, the postmen in our Delivery Service have 3 days to post the communal bill receipts to the mailboxes in their area.  The company, in principle, does not care whether the postman will carry them from 9 to 18 or from 18 to 9 (but we require that each postman be available for communication during working hours to resolve current issues).  I just want to draw your attention to the fact that it is impossible to transfer the entire company to a free work schedule, as some "business consultants" offer.  If you decide to start a business, remember this. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/72618/">https://habr.com/ru/post/72618/</a></p>
