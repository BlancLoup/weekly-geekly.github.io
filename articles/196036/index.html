Know your target audience in person</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h5>  A brief summary of the study: </h5><br>  <b>Facebook</b> is still biased towards youth, but in the audience from 45 to 54 years old there has been an increase of 45% since the end of 2012.  Over 75% of US college graduates use Facebook;  more than 67% use Facebook regardless of education level. <br>  <b>Instagram</b> : 68% of Instagram users are women, according to Appdata. <br>  <b>Twitter</b> has a surprisingly young audience of users, as for a large social network.  It is popular with news-obsessed users in urban areas. <br>  <b>LinkedIn</b> is a more international network biased towards a male audience.  61% of its users are male, and 64% are outside the United States. <br>  <b>Google+</b> is the most male-oriented social network.  70% of users are men. <br>  <b>Pinterest</b> : tablet users dominate, and 84% of US users are women. <br>  <b>Tumblr</b> boasts teenagers and young people who are interested in expressing themselves. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cd4/566/8de/cd45668de69230824b6f85cde72b7a13.png"><br><br>  Under the cut a lot of diagrams. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In attempts to explore the audience for the promotion of our <a href="http://filegiver.com/">electronic library</a> , we decided to dot the i's to maximize the understanding of the characteristics of the audience of each social network.  Each social network has formed its uniqueness thanks to the demographics of the people who use it.  Some social networks are preferred by young people who are most active in the evening, others are business people with high incomes who post posts during the working day.  We told in a recent <a href="https://intelligence.businessinsider.com/platform-specific-brand-strategies-2013-6">study</a> why brands and businesses need to have a separate promotion strategy in different social networks, rather than one common concept for all.  One of the most important issues in a promotion strategy for a particular social network is understanding who your audience is and what they like to do.  In this report, we will describe the demographic data of users of each major social network, which will help brands and companies to determine their priority networks.  You can learn a lot about consumers, if you learn their habits in social networks.  The ability to identify the demographics of an audience of social networks at a detailed level is the basis for all targeted advertising campaigns and marketing.  Companies need to know who their customers are before investing in marketing.  This study also provides an opportunity to better understand the socio-demographic data of these networks, and what opportunities lie behind them.

    <h5>  How do we access social networks? </h5><br><h6>  Worldwide </h6><br>  Globally, PCs are still the primary means by which people access social networks.  <a href="http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/reports/2012/state-of-the-media-the-social-media-report-2012.html">The</a> Nielsen <a href="http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/reports/2012/state-of-the-media-the-social-media-report-2012.html">survey</a> , which was attended by more than 28,000 consumers from around the world with Internet access, found that 96% of people in Latin America and Europe use their PCs to access social networks.  Other regions of the world showed similar numbers: 93% in the Asia-Pacific region, and 91% in the Middle East and Africa.  Among these regions, Asia-Pacific is the leader in using social networks from mobile phones and tablets, 59% and 28%, respectively. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/db2/0fd/4aa/db20fd4aa7bac563f3435e61189f202d.png"><br><br><h6>  IN USA </h6><br>  Internet use is widespread in the US, with an average person spending 3 hours and 6 minutes a day on the Internet in 2012, according <a href="https://intelligence.businessinsider.com/us-consumers-spend-more-time-on-social-media-2013-8">to</a> GfK and IAB.  Social networks in particular, are one of the most common places where people spend time while on the Internet.  While <a href="https://intelligence.businessinsider.com/facebook-approaches-200-million-visitors-2013-8">Google and Yahoo still attract more unique visitors</a> (mobile and PC) than any other web resource, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Pinterest are in the top of American websites with 50+ million unique visitors, according to ComScore.  <a href="http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/newswire/2012/social-media-report-2012-social-media-comes-of-age.html">Americans aged 18-34 spend the most time on social networks.</a>  Nevertheless, the time spent by users on social networks increased by 37% in all age groups from July 2011 to July 2012.  However, about half of Internet users aged 65 and older still do not use social networks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/72f/a44/59c/72fa4459ccf5b33209afc3a6b33a222d.png"><br><br><h5>  What is each social network? </h5><br><h6>  Twitter </h6><br>  Twitter has one of the youngest audiences among all social networks;  among all American Twitter users, 30% are between the ages of 18 and 29, while people over the age of 65 are only 5%, <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2013/Social-media-users.aspx">according to the Pew Research Center</a> .  However, according to a GlobalWebIndex <a href="https://www.globalwebindex.net/Stream-Social">study</a> published in the first quarter of 2013, the audience aged 55-64 years old is the fastest growing, with a growth rate of 79% since 2012.  As a rule, Twitter users live in cities or suburban areas.  People tend to use Twitter to get news.  <a href="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/189776/one-third-of-adults-under-30-get-news-on-social-networks-now/">According to Poynter</a> , in 2012, 83% of users confirmed that they were reading the news on Twitter.  Below you can find a world map of 3 billion tweets, and see the most active urban areas. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0e5/60b/753/0e560b753e8153f4670cd7af5be7e682.png"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2013/Social-media-users.aspx">More than a quarter of</a> US Internet users of Hispanic and African-American descent use Twitter, this data is more relevant for urbanized regions.  Only 14% of white Internet users have Twitter accounts. <br>  <i>For companies, the best time to tweet is from Monday to Thursday from 13:00 to 15:00.</i>  <i>The worst time is after 3:00 PM on Friday, since at this time Twitter has the lowest activity.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/57b/633/398/57b63339835e792d4dc2ca082fe1022e.png"><br><br><h6>  Facebook </h6><br>  Facebook has accumulated the largest number of users among all social networks: 67% of US Internet users have accounts on Facebook, according <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2013/Social-media-users.aspx">to Pew Research</a> .  <a href="https://intelligence.businessinsider.com/half-of-facebook-outside-us-and-europe-2013-9">More than half of</a> Facebook users currently live outside of North America and Europe;  According to L2 Think Tank, as of May 2013, 29% of the 1.1 billion Facebook users are in Asia. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/77f/7c2/1fd/77f7c21fd54dbcce534866f2594e5673.png"><br><br>  Users from emerging markets represent a huge growth potential for Facebook.  In the past quarter, Facebook <a href="https://intelligence.businessinsider.com/facebook-ups-average-revenue-per-user-2013-7">reported</a> an annual revenue growth of 70% per user in markets outside of Asia, Europe, the USA and Canada.  <a href="https://fbcdn-dragon-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/851575_492821944140017_1070145609_n.pdf">Mark Zuckerberg</a> said that his goal is to connect 5 billion people to the Internet, and he sincerely hopes that Facebook will open the door to the Internet for them. <br>  Facebook is not very different from other social networks and has a fairly young audience, which is reflected in what type of advertising is the most effective and has a high conversion rate.  For example, luxury goods and services brands are still more successfully advertised in magazines than in social networks, according <a href="https://intelligence.businessinsider.com/social-media-lags-for-luxury-goods-ads-2013-6">to data from the Shullman Research Center</a> .  Other types of brands ‚Äî such as consumer goods (FMCG) ‚Äîreally perform well on Facebook.  The number of users loyal to the Coca-Cola brand on Facebook significantly exceeds the number of fans of other brands represented on this network.  <a href="https://intelligence.businessinsider.com/facebook-wins-as-a-brand-platform-2013-9">Red Bull and Starbucks are also among the most tracked brands on Facebook</a> .  Moreover, <a href="https://intelligence.businessinsider.com/facebook-accounts-for-more-than-half-of-all-retargeted-ad-clicks-on-the-web-2013-8">Facebook generates more than half of all traffic from online advertising</a> , from which it can be concluded that Facebook users are the most active in their interaction with advertisers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8f1/34c/652/8f134c652de41a9ffc5db5f5ae106c83.png"><br><br>  Despite its young audience, the segment of users aged 45-54 years has grown rapidly, <a href="https://www.globalwebindex.net/Stream-Social">increasing by 46% since 2012</a> .  Just as in the situation with Twitter and Pinterest, the increase in the time of using Facebook is explained by the widespread use of mobile devices.  Facebook is the <a href="https://intelligence.businessinsider.com/google-owns-three-of-the-four-most-used-smartphone-apps-2013-9">most popular</a> application among social networks on the iPhone, <a href="https://intelligence.businessinsider.com/most-popular-social-platforms-among-iphone-users-and-what-they-share-2013-7">its share is 66%</a> .  According <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2013/Social-media-users.aspx">to</a> Pew Research, almost 75% of American Internet users who have at least some college level education use Facebook. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/372/641/384/3726413848f31794a11e2aa6e1446bb7.png"><br><br>  <i>The best time to post on Facebook is between 13:00 and 16:00 on Wednesday, when many young people try to distract themselves from their studies or work.</i>  <i>The worst time is after 4:00 pm on weekends, when young people spend their free time together.</i> <br><br><h6>  Instagram </h6><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e86/7b9/daa/e867b9daa1112076d0ff0baca0f6c26a.png"><br><br>  Instagram is a mobile-oriented social network.  <a href="http://appdata.com/">More than 90% of Instagram users are under 35 years old</a> , which makes this social network an attractive platform for many clothing, entertainment and media brands with 18-34 years old audiences.  Application users are clearly divided between iOS and Android owners.  According <a href="http://blog.instagram.com/post/47035276788/instagram-for-android-one-year-later-one-year">to the company</a> in its blog, almost half of the 130 million applications installed on tablets or smartphones running Android.  As in Pinterest, Instagram has a greater number of girl users, about 68%, according to <a href="http://appdata.com/">Appdata</a> .  Instagram is also popular with urban residents; <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2013/Social-media-users.aspx">17% of US residents</a> who live in urban areas use Instagram, compared with 11% in suburban and rural areas.  Among the four most popular photo sharing networks, Instagram accounts for only <a href="https://intelligence.businessinsider.com/snapchat-vies-for-photo-sharing-crown-2013-5">about 7% of the daily photo upload volume</a> (544 million daily downloads).  Therefore, not so Instagram and heavyweight, as many would like to believe.  But Instagram also relies on video content shared by users from mobile devices, according to preliminary <a href="https://intelligence.businessinsider.com/instagram-more-engaging-than-vine-2013-6">data,</a> this service is more popular than Vine. <br><br><h6>  LinkedIn </h6><br>  LinkedIn is a social network for white-collar workers, where they establish professional connections, share experiences and so on.  Such an audience is highly desirable due to its high education and high level of income. <br>  According <a href="http//www.nytimes.com/2013/06/17/technology/sharing-business-insights-linkedin-builds-its-publishing-presence.html%3Fref%3Dbusiness%26_r%3D0">to</a> Daniel Roth, chief editor of LinkedIn, their users spend more and more time on the site, looking at 63% more pages from mobile devices and PCs in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period of 2012.  This gives B2B marketers a real chance to get a piece of attention to their target audience, and to do this in the context of building professional relationships, including with top management, who makes decisions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/98d/690/0e4/98d6900e44537906d8655b5df56c9f5a.png"><br><br>  <a href="">According to Quantcast</a> , 61% of LinkedIn users are men, and they are more educated than the average Internet user in the United States.  80% of LinkedIn users are white.  <a href="http://visual.ly/10-amazing-linkedin-statistics-2013">According to Visual.ly</a> , 64% of LinkedIn users are outside the United States, many in the UK, the Netherlands, France and other European countries.  Unlike many other leading social networks, LinkedIn does not have a high network utilization rate from mobile devices.  Only <a href="https://intelligence.businessinsider.com/linkedin-lags-on-mobile-2013-8">28% of LinkedIn unique visitors</a> in the United States at least once accessed the site using a mobile device in June 2013, and about 16% accessed the network only from mobile devices. <br><br>  <i>The best time to post on LinkedIn is the span from Tuesday to Thursday from 07:00 to 09:00 or from 17:00 to 18:00, when white-collar workers are just starting or already finishing their work day.</i> <br><br><h6>  Google+ </h6><br>  Google+ is the most male-oriented large social network.  <a href="http://www.plusdemographics.com/country_report.php">Men make up 70% of total users</a> .  In addition, the majority of users (just over 50%) are in the age range from 18 to 24 years. <br>  However, as with Twitter and Facebook, the number of older users is rapidly increasing.  On Google+, an audience of 45‚Äì54 years old is the fastest growing, 56% growth since 2012, according to a GlobalWebIndex <a href="https://www.globalwebindex.net/Stream-Social">study</a> .  30% of Google+ users are in the US, 14% in India, and 5% in Brazil, according to <a href="http://www.plusdemographics.com/country_report.php">Plus Demographics</a> data.  Despite the ridicule of IT journalists that this network is a ‚Äúghost town‚Äù, Google+ has a huge audience of over <a href="https://intelligence.businessinsider.com/google-surpasses-twitter-on-desktop-2013-7">40 million users in the US</a> using only PCs.  This is more than Twitter.  And from mobile devices?  <a href="https://intelligence.businessinsider.com/google-owns-three-of-the-four-most-used-smartphone-apps-2013-9">The Google+ app is used by 30% of smartphone owners around the world</a> .  However, Google+ seriously loses Twitter and Facebook in <a href="https://intelligence.businessinsider.com/google-surpasses-twitter-in-accounts-2013-6">user activity</a> , in how they interact with other people's profiles and other pages.  For example, the number of people subscribed to profiles of various brands on Google+ looks very scant compared to the number of subscribers to the brand pages on Facebook.  Google+ has gained great popularity among fans of new technologies and creative individuals, because the site is adapted to accommodate large-sized visual content, and it easily integrates with other popular Google products, like Gmail and search. <br><br>  <i>The best time to post to Google+ is any weekday from 09:00 to 11:00.</i>  <i>The worst time is from 18:00 to 08:00.</i> <br><br><h6>  Pinterest </h6><br>  Pinterest rushes in the wake of the growing popularity of mobile devices.  This is really the most popular social network on tablets.  Pinterest has already won <a href="https://intelligence.businessinsider.com/pinterest-and-its-tablet-audience-2013-8">48.2% of the</a> social networking <a href="https://intelligence.businessinsider.com/pinterest-and-its-tablet-audience-2013-8">market</a> on the iPad. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/07b/363/3a707b363111caa2d62fd72e8f721e02.png"><br><br>  What is shared in this network?  Content associated with food or drinks is <a href="https://intelligence.businessinsider.com/ipad-users-gravitate-to-pinterest-2013-7">18% of the total number of posts</a> , and is the largest category, according to ShareThis data.  Posts related to family and upbringing (the most common category of posts among Facebook users via iPhone), account for 17% of all Pinterest content published by iPad users.  We believe Pinterest will continue to gain momentum thanks to the growing tablet market, and will take its place in the ‚Äútop four‚Äù next to Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook.  According to a survey of Business Insider tablet owners in 2012, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/ipad-usage-survey-results-2012-7%3Fop%3D1">46% of people spend 2 to 4 hours a day using their iPad</a> , 25% spend 1 to 2 hours a day, and 13.5% spend less than one hour a day.  So who are all these people using Pinterest on tablets?  According <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2013/Social-media-users.aspx">to</a> Pew Research, 38% of Internet users in the US between the ages of 18 and 50 used Pinterest.  <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2013/Social-media-users.aspx">Pinterest audience</a> is heavily biased towards white women who live in suburban or rural areas with a family income of $ 50,000 or more. <br>  Although Pinterest is a social network of Media First, it has elements of e-commerce, as users can view products that they like.  In a sense, this is really an online store. <br>  <i>The best time to post on Pinterest is either between 14:00 and 16:00 or from 20:00 to 01:00.</i>  <i>The worst time for fasting is the second half of the day between 5:00 pm and 7:00 pm, when most families are having dinner, watching the news and doing other things.</i> <br><br><h6>  Tumblr </h6><br>  In December 2012, Branch co-founder Josh Miller caused a slight sensation when he published the post ‚ÄúTrend Technologies in the Tenth Class,‚Äù outlining the habits of his younger sister and her friends related to the Internet, gadgets and other products of the digital age.  Among other things, Miller discovered that Tumblr is a <a href="https://medium.com/product-design/d8d4f2300cf3">very popular network among teenagers</a> , for whom Tumblr is a place of self-expression, usually through the publication of photographs.  It turns out that Miller‚Äôs observation was correct.  Nearly half, or 46% of the 34 million active users of Tumblr in the first quarter of 2013 were in the age range from 16 to 24, according <a href="https://www.globalwebindex.net/what-has-yahoo-actually-acquired-a-snapshot-of-tumblr-in-q1-2013/">to the</a> Global Web Index.  This is 15.6 million young people, which is roughly equivalent to the population in Guatemala.  Moreover, adolescents who use Tumblr often use it - 61% of adolescents between the ages of 13 and 18 say they use the service several hours a week or even more, according to a <a href="http://blog.garrytan.com/tenth-grade-tech-trends-my-survey-data-says-s">study</a> conducted by partner Y Combinator Jerry Tan.  A young audience is exactly what interested Yahoo at the time of the acquisition of Tumblr.  However, in comparison with other social networks, Tumblr is much less popular in all age groups.  Only 6% of Internet users in the 18+ age group use Tumblr. <br><br>  4 more interesting diagrams: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/047/db3/c18/047db3c185323f03eade69f67822a342.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/666/432/48f/66643248f4f0cbe3b3136beca458e704.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/92d/1bc/704/92d1bc7048c68d0b445c267591e6c43b.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/592/150/39c/59215039c0d29c58e078b0158d680d53.png"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/document/523c56626bb3f7084a8d4db0/bii-social-media-demographics.pdf">PDF version of all translated research</a> <br><br>  PS A few words from the author of the translation ... Some links may not be available because  are on paid resources.  This study is probably difficult to apply to the CIS because  in our suburban and rural areas nobody uses ipads, but nevertheless something interesting for marketing can be extracted even in our open spaces, for example, the <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-best-times-to-post-on-each-major-social-network-2013-5">best time for posts in the network</a> , some general demographic trends ... Otherwise, this study is very interesting, especially for projects targeted at an audience of the whole world or its individual regions. <br>  The continuation of the IT research market research cycle will be in the very near future.  <a href="http://filegiver.com/c/delovaya-literatura/marketing-pr-reklama">Books on marketing</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/196036/">https://habr.com/ru/post/196036/</a></p>
