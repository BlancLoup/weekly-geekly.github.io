Riding in public transport in major cities is similar to canning vegetables, and driving a car is like fighting.  Angry faces of passers-by bloom only at facebook rallies.  Where really good, and all like! <br>  You do not always want to go to the untidy, ugly streets and see gloomy and gloomy people there.  And it seems that in an unfriendly and sometimes hostile environment, domestic design does not develop, and bright talents are dissolved in a gray reality. <br><br>  On the other hand, maybe this is the ideal ground for creating new Internet solutions?  Solutions for refusing to go out of their "bunkers" of people?  After all, if there is a delivery of sushi or pizza, then there may be a delivery of logo design, for example ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Maybe it's time to create new services? <br>  Why do I say ‚Äúnew‚Äù - because, as a rule, we have a Western business model that does not work unless it is seriously redone.  And the level of these alterations can be compared with a sex change operation. <br><br>  About 5 years ago I wondered: why not really be ‚Äúdesign via the Internet‚Äù?

Now this is quite a popular site with graphic designers.  HERE DESIGN was my first invaluable experience with the new concept of ‚Äúcrowdsourcing‚Äù.  A continuation of my story with the "source of the crowd" was <a href="http://godesigner.ru/">godesigner.ru</a> . <br><br>  Go Designer is a platform where the customer creates a pitch (competition, tender), and designers from around the world offer their options.  The reward is received by the one whose option the customer ultimately chose. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b8b/be5/8fc/b8bbe58fce7a4151babdd724111fab88.png"><br><br>  The essence and idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe project will surely seem familiar to you, and some experts will even call a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/133744/">couple of analogs offhand</a> .  So, it seems to be the same, but not quite.  And here we come to what is called the new service.  Why is Go Designer so good, and what makes it different? <br><br>  In principle, as it seems: creating a design requires a customer with a financial opportunity, from which you need to get a job (brief), and a designer with a set of certain skills and good taste.  But in fact, there are some incredibly frightening factors, seeming problems - but with very simple solutions. <br><br>  Let's analyze several barriers in the head of a customer creating a design through the Internet, and our solutions: <br>  - There are so many freelancers in the network, but how to be sure that with the chosen one I don‚Äôt waste time and money? <br>  And what if you choose the solution directly, and not the freelancer, and do not lose a lot of time studying the countless number of portfolios posted? <br>  -I can not formulate the task (brief)! <br>  There is a simple solution: fill out / create a brief together, just calling. <br>  -The solutions to my task were laid out so much, and I do not know which one to choose. <br>  We can provide an opportunity for peer review.  For example, an expert selected by the customer will determine the 3 best solutions and comment on why these ideas best suit the task. <br>  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not very sure if I‚Äôm doing the right thing, and I don‚Äôt want anyone to know anything: competitors, partners, my employees ... <br>  You can close the pitch (contest) from search engines and prying eyes <br>  I want everyone to know about my competition! <br>  We will help you create a media event in online media and on social networking pages. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/78d/aaf/389/78daaf3898cb5587ca6cf08c39d2b1ef.png"><br><br>  Now, the doubts and prejudices of the performers (creatives, designers): <br>  -My infuriates "client creativity."  I don‚Äôt like what the communication turns into and what it is all about. <br>  The freelancer has the right to stop working at any time on the project, because, until his decision is chosen as the winner, and he has not received money for the account, all rights to the idea are reserved for him! <br>  - They will cheat, they will take away the idea, they will not pay. <br>  Already paid.  The new resource is ready to take all the questions with payment so that the creative specialist doesn‚Äôt have a headache about it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/97e/2ab/fd9/97e2abfd9b57ebb3ed549c9e6938c3d1.png"><br><br>  This is what we have tried to take into account and implement in the pages of Go Designer.  But to consider and implement this is only half the story.  The other half is ‚Äúmake the wheel spin.‚Äù <br>  After all, the target audience is two, respectively, and two questions: where to get designers with your hands, and customers with money. <br>  With the search for designers, the question was not complicated, because we have been writing for them for two and a half years, and some of them have grown as specialists already directly to HERE DESIGN. <br>  To set a high level of work at Go Designer, we gathered a pool of 10 proven designers and enlisted their mandatory support, with the increase in the number of orders we plan to invite everyone. <br>  For the first customers, we managed to form an almost win-win proposal from four points, including: ‚ÄúWe will return the money to the customer, if upon the expiration of the suggested ideas he does not like.‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ad8/002/296/ad80022968b7731905ed40831281314e.jpg"><br><br>  We are planning to move to the stage of open testing by April 5. <br><br>  Summing up my speech, I can say: I believe in ‚Äúdesign through the Internet‚Äù and I will make efforts to make everyone else believe in it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/140327/">https://habr.com/ru/post/140327/</a></p>
