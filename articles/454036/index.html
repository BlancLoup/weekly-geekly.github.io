  <section class="page js-page"><h1>6 ways to go to hell ready-made solutions and lower a million or two</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/it/en/4r/iten4rh-hg3luuw_byrg6kyfbfm.png"><br><br>  Hi, now I will tell you what will happen to a promising project, if from the very beginning to turn to ready-made solutions a la Wordpress, Open Cart and any CMS, thinking that this is MVP.  I will be based on a three-month work experience on one of the projects, in the GitHub of which in the previous 8 months a single commit has not fallen into the production branch. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Recipe of bloated VP / OC / CMS to geostationary orbit </h3><br><h4>  1. Choose any ready-made CMS </h4><br>  In no case do not call architects and forget about microservices and architecture designed for your needs.  Our task is to make it possible to turn the admin panel in 5 minutes after the developer has turned on the PC, and not to make development easy to manage.  This MVP should consist exclusively of ready-made solutions.  After all, it is in our project that plug-ins will never be confiliated and are already designed for loads of any intensity. <br><br><h4>  2. Forbid to document anything </h4><br>  No cms need to be documented.  Forbid to document anything.  Especially kernel modifications.  After only 3 months, the freelancer becomes the keeper of sacral knowledge about how this emerald dumpling works, and the magical techniques of launching the server, which, of course, is one, and since the initial installation of the toolkit, nobody has recreated it.  The pledge of decent management is dependence on employees and, of course, on the only working server.

    <h4>  3. Call the GURU! </h4><br>  After the fixes of conflicts between 234 and 417 plug-in began to take at least 10 times more time than the introduction of new functions, your sure way is to look for a GURU, wiser by experience, who without much effort will rewrite (rewrite) a little code, and the next 500 plug-ins will take their rightful place.  By the way, I was ‚Äúlucky enough‚Äù to be in the role of a guru who turns technologies, and therefore this is a real medical history. <br><br><h4>  4. Your project should consist of one area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility. </h4><br>  On microservices, we safely and consciously put it from the very beginning, and in 5 months it‚Äôs time to hire a new programmer.  And let him be responsible for the layout.  Well, and a little more for the backend, because they are mixed.  Well, for the database, because how to be responsible for the backend without databases.  Well, for fixes, let him still answer.  And more ... and more ... and more ... <br><br><h4>  5. Trello + Jira + Slack + Excel + ... + Skype </h4><br>  Thanks to the kind one and a half thousand plug-ins that are ALREADY there are about 5 errors every day, the resolution of which requires 2 days.  The speed of writing features falls exponentially.  It is obvious that we are thrown at the time of development.  And you need to enter the third task manager.  (Yes, clinical projects usually have two task managers).  Trello, Jira and Excel are just the foundation of control.  Some wizards also use intra-corporate task managers, assigned chat messages and unplanned sudden instructions. <br><br><h4>  6. Voice transcripts </h4><br>  Developed lead us by the nose, and therefore all voice conferences on the coordination of bug fixes need to be archived, saved to the cloud and regularly listened to.  After all, the thing is always in the developers ... <br><br>  <b>Tip 1:</b> Testing was successful - urgently throw out ready-made solutions and write the appropriate architecture. <br><br>  <b>Tip 2:</b> If you are not just a motivated start-up and have either resources or a financial strategy, then you must include writing from scratch in it.  And generally give this business to professionals or the technical director.  (It is important that this is a programmer, not a professor from a scientific research institute, otherwise you will not be able to punch cards) <br><br>  <b>What if ALREADY and you are in charge?</b> <br>  - rewrite. <br><br>  <b>What if ALREADY and you are not the main?</b> <br>  - Explain the essence of the problem to the management and rewrite. <br><br>  PS Yii2 was used in the project, but even with it there were these problems.  What happens with WP is a disaster at all. <br><br>  PPS The reason, of course, is the incompetence of management, although the monolithic architecture also does not stand aside. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/454036/">https://habr.com/ru/post/454036/</a></p>
