The tenth anniversary version is the result of many years of developer labor, which should take the company to a new level.  During the year, UCWeb programmers worked on the new version and tried to make a really good update. <br><br>  Let's look at what is so important and revolutionary appeared in the UC Browser.  And so, we open the browser ... <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aa2/f66/5e8/aa2f665e8ad14ca8b779164c15a5a71b.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Visually, the browser is very transformed.  In the new version, the main changes were made to the interface and design.  It is worth noting that the browser has become more stylish.  New design was developed in California.  The company, which was engaged in the development, has done a great analytical work, studying the psychology and behavior of users.  A new arrangement of buttons, a horizontal menu, icons of sites - everything was written down to the smallest detail according to the data obtained.  How to make the menu more spacious?  Where is the user's main focus when opening a browser?  What commands should be on the main screen, and which can be hidden in the menu?  How to provide more comfortable Internet surfing?  - All these questions became the basis of the new design.  UCWeb designers noted that the interface will be developed further along the intended course, and will be aimed at increasing usability. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cdc/e53/c2c/cdce53c2cbf54b769f1a72db3f62bf5b.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  The homepage button has been moved to the bottom middle section, which is more in line with the Android style.  The four most used function buttons have been moved up the menu for easier access.  But the most important and useful change is adding the button ‚ÄúRefresh page‚Äù to the main screen. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/99b/0ca/052/99b0ca052bea463a850c73fe4ba1cb3c.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  Further changes affected the tab manager.  The number of possible tabs remains the same, ten can be opened at the same time, but now the sites have become much easier to manage.  The new tab manager has become much more convenient, sites can now be scrolled through, as in an album, and you can close them upwards.  In UC Browser 10.0, you can close all tabs at the same time by clicking on the button - Close All Tabs. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6bc/0e5/951/6bc0e595152e4483b18c3b4a0702dc15.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  As we can see, the new interface should help users, it is more comfortable and easier to use the mobile Internet.  We also want to draw attention to the new slogan of UC Browser: ‚ÄúEvery day we discover a new one.‚Äù  As the marketing team explains, UC Browser strives to become the main application on the phone, as a fast mobile assistant in the daily life of Internet users. <br><br>  As for the functionality of the new version, here we would note: <br><br>  <b>1. Ad blocker</b> <br>  UC Browser can detect ads and block their downloads.  Moreover, the browser automatically reorganizes the blocks on the page to make it easier for the user to view it.  As a result, pages load much faster, and traffic consumption decreases accordingly. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a06/d72/006/a06d72006f264d5caca60b6051577fa2.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  The ad blocking mechanism is not that complicated.  Initially, the developers analyzed a large list of different rules for ad blocking filters.  In fact, it looks like a text file that contains a list of rules.  In the latest version of the browser, such a list is periodically loaded automatically (its weight is not more than 65KB), which allows UC to constantly use up-to-date information.  When a user visits a web page, the browser checks the links on the page with the black list to check if there are ads on it that need to be blocked. <br><br>  When you open a website, UC Browser first checks the links on the page and if any of them matches the rule from the filter list, it will be blocked and the browser will not load it. <br><br>  <b>2. Image viewing mode</b> <br>  Previously, UC Browser had a special mode of viewing sites - text.  This mode allows you to significantly increase the speed of opening pages, as well as save traffic.  Text browsing is very popular among users who have weak Internet or traffic restrictions.  With the new update, users have the opportunity to open the pages of sites in the image viewer.  Now fans of social networks and various sites with pictures and photos, can conveniently and quickly view the content of interest.  In the image viewing mode, users see only pictures, without distracting text or other unnecessary information.  In this mode, they can also share, upload or draw something in the picture. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cc2/5ee/84e/cc25ee84ed4a4b3ab85f0717317c0a77.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  <b>3. Background page color</b> <br>  The uniqueness and customization of UC Browser has always set it apart from the rest.  The ability to change the theme and background of the browser allows you to make the browser more interesting, enjoyable, special.  Now users of UC Browser also have the ability to change the background color of web pages.  This feature has been added, not only as a ‚Äúcool feature‚Äù, but also carries a very serious meaning - the soft background color reduces eye strain.  According to medical research, 62% of active Internet users have vision problems, and 87% of respondents feel discomfort after 2 hours of using the Internet, while at the same time with a ‚Äúsoft‚Äù background, the percentage drops to 69%. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/970/aee/ddc/970aeeddcd8b42ec99212d5df63a686b.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  <b>4. Navigation menu</b> <br>  Navigation menu is one of the main features of the UC Browser.  Using Navigation, users can quickly find the site they need, read the news, watch the horoscope, schedule, airfare, download an interesting video or photo.  All sites are divided into thematic categories, and the more popular ones are placed in the top positions.  Most recently, the product team implemented a very interesting feature in the News category.  The system automatically finds popular news and broadcasts them in a browser, currently three categories are running: Sports, IT, Economy. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/56b/c2c/8f3/56bc2c8f3148478a940c795367db501e.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  Without a doubt, the new version of UC Browser is a new stage in the development of a mobile browser.  The concept and the desire to become a mobile assistant for millions of users can be traced not only in marketing plans, but also in new versions of the browser. <br><br>  Download UC Browser 10.0 - <a href="http://bit.ly/ucforandroid">http://bit.ly/ucforandroid</a> <br><br>  Install UC browser 10.0 and share your impressions in the comments to the article. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/241899/">https://habr.com/ru/post/241899/</a></p>
