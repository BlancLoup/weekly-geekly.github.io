Also in a stalemate were the creators of CoolReader and Reader.  With the ‚ÄúReader‚Äù, the situation took an unexpected turn and now looks more like a banal raider seizure.  Litters refuses to withdraw the complaint against the application until the authors turn it into a Liters showcase or transfer their speech technology.

      I quote <a href="http://4pda.ru/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D426738%26st%3D340">firsthand</a> : <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  I wanted to comment on the phrase from the official letter of the company Liters, on whose behalf the complaint was received on our Reader application and it was removed from the AppStore on December 17, 2012. <br><br>  <i>"We also contacted the owners of the Reader program on January 25, 2013. Now we continue to discuss possible solutions to the problem and return the application to the AppStore."</i> <i><br></i> <br>  There was only one Skype conversation with CEO Litres Sergey Anurev, initiated by NAMI.  Although we do not understand why we need our application, which does not violate the rights of third parties, coordinate with Liters, WE initiated the call and offered to find some cooperation options interesting for the two companies, BUT only after Liters received a letter in Apple with the withdrawal of the complaint, and our application "Reader" will be restored. <br><br>  To which the company Liters, in the person of the CEO, apparently will now be said ‚Äúin an unofficial report‚Äù said that there are only two ways to restore our application - <br>  1. Our application should become a ‚Äúshowcase‚Äù of Liters and in our application the user should purchase and voice Liters books.  2. We transfer the technology to Liters and Liters builds it into its own application, sharing with us some bonuses "that need to be discussed."  On our side there were 5 people present and the conversation was kept. <br><br>  From these options, we should have been probably delighted.  But we are not thrilled ... <br><br>  Very upset because  if the entire Internet community stood up for Munrider, only visually impaired people can stand up for our young application TAK (remember, the scandal did not start on February 1 ... Liters removed us with its complaint on December 17, but no one noticed counting on any public outcry, we had to wait for the proposals of the Liters, which they promised to send us, but so far they have not sent. <br><br>  Although what suggestions may be ... We do not violate anything.  All that is required Liters is to write a letter with a complaint withdrawal.  And only then discuss with us "possible solutions to the problem." <br><br>  I will write off the progress of the situation.  Please do not forget that it is not over yet.  And that only public opinion support can return our wonderful technology to users. <br>  Examples of sound synthesis in our application can be heard here: <a href="http://chitatel.pro/">chitatel.pro</a> <br>  The synthesized text sounds so realistic that it seems this scares the producers of audio books. <br><br>  Liters companies I want to convey that of course we agree to cooperate and are ready to consider the possibility of embedding our technology into the Liters company application, but only after the restoration of our Reader application.  As soon as the Liters company writes a complaint letter, please duplicate it in my email, and we will immediately inform the Internet public of all resources available to us. <br><br>  Head of Mobile Unit <br>  companies Speech Technology Center <br>  Yegor Ryaboshlyk </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/168221/">https://habr.com/ru/post/168221/</a></p>
