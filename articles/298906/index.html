The project obliges news aggregators to ‚Äúverify the accuracy of the disseminated socially significant information.‚Äù  For the publication of inaccurate information, an extrajudicial ‚Äútaking measures to curb the dissemination of inaccurate information‚Äù on the complaint of authorized bodies is provided. <br><br>  The news aggregator must be a Russian legal entity.  The share of foreign capital in it should not exceed 20%.  6 months is given to bring the company structure in line with the new requirements.

      The company will have to keep the published information for six months. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  For the refusal to remove false information at the request of Roskomnadzor, the news aggregator will be obliged to pay a fine - from 400 thousand rubles for individuals and up to 5 million rubles for legal entities. <br><br>  According to one of the authors of the project, Aleksey Kazakov (the Fair Russia faction), ‚Äúnews aggregators‚Äù should ‚Äúresponsibly‚Äù approach the information: either reprint authoritative media that check the information, or be responsible for reprinting.  ‚ÄúAggregators of influence are superior to the media.  But we don‚Äôt want to create conditions for uncomfortable work for them, so the right to apply to Roskomnadzor is given only to the relevant departments, not to citizens, ‚Äùhe <a href="http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/2923543">told</a> Kommersant. <br><br>  Member of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation Alexander Yushchenko confirmed to the publication that he is introducing a bill to the State Duma together with Mr. Kazakov.  He referred to sociological studies, according to which about 60% of users derive news not through traditional media, but in search programs and aggregators.  ‚ÄúSuch resources determine the news agenda, ranking the news.  This function requires the same responsibility as the media, ‚Äùhe believes.  After all, the inaccuracy of information may be associated with "biased placement of news" in the tops.  In addition, according to him, foreign social networks Twitter, Facebook in other countries are already testing their own news services, so this activity requires regulation by Russian laws. <br><br>  According to a source in the State Duma, up to 30 large companies will fall under the scope of the project: Yandex, Mail.ru, Google, Rambler, VKontakte, Sputnik, Facebook, Twitter, and others. <br><blockquote>  49.8% of Mail.ru shares are holders of global depositary receipts that are traded on the LSE;  27.6% - from MIH Mail Investment Company BV (owned by South African media holding Naspers);  15.2% for New Media and Technology Investment LP and its affiliated structures;  7.4% - from the Chinese investment company Tencent. </blockquote><br>  The press service of "Yandex" "Kommersant" reported that the service "Yandex.News" simply can not exist, if you assign the resource work on checking the news.  ‚ÄúEvery day Yandex.News indexes over 100 thousand news reports from almost 7 thousand sources.  Yandex.News does not have a revision, the service automatically collects messages from partners and shows their titles and fragments in the same form.  The full text of the news aggregator "Yandex" does not publish - readers follow the links to the sites of partners. <br><blockquote>  The main shareholder is the head of the Yandex group of companies, Arkady Volozh, his voting share is 39.81%, economic ‚Äî 10.84%, another 7% of the votes and 4% of the capital of Yandex‚Äôs employee Vladimir Ivanov.  The investor of the company, a group of Baring Vostok funds that manage, among other things, pension and university money from the USA, Western Europe and Asia, has 15.55% of the votes and 4.69% of the capital. </blockquote><br>  It turns out that for online aggregators it is proposed to establish the same rules as for media with foreign capital.  In October 2014, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on amendments to the <a href="http://base.garant.ru/10164247/">law</a> "On Mass Media". <br><blockquote>  According to the new amendments, since January 2016, foreigners are prohibited from directly or indirectly owning more than 20% of any Russian media.  Therefore, now foreign investors can either leave the Russian market or reorganize the business so that it meets the new requirements. </blockquote><br>  In addition, in 2014, the ‚Äúlaw on bloggers‚Äù already obliged the authors of Internet resources with attendance of ‚Äúover 3 thousand users per day‚Äù to register with Roskomnadzor and imposed a number of restrictions on the content of resources. <br><br>  <b>Update:</b> Interfax has just <a href="http://www.interfax.ru/russia/496103">announced</a> that the Ministry of Communications has opposed a bill that equates news aggregators with mass media. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe did not see this bill, it did not officially come to us, and we don‚Äôt like this idea,‚Äù said Alexey Volin, Deputy Minister of Communications and Mass Communications of the Russian Federation.  According to him, the authors of the project did not hold any consultations with the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media.  There is a contradiction in this regard: Roskomnadzor is declared in the draft law as a supervisory authority, but it is controlled by the Ministry of Communications and Mass Communications. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe believe that if we bring this idea to its logical end, then with the same success, newsstands can be equated with the media.  We see in the window of the kiosk the covers of newspapers and magazines and we can read news headlines on them - why isn‚Äôt the news aggregator? ‚Äù, Commented Volin. <br><br>  Advisor to the President for the development of the Internet German Klimenko commented on the situation of the publication of RBC: <br><blockquote>  This is an old story, it has been discussed for about two years.  Perhaps from her refuse.  I had a MediaMetrix news aggregator, which I gave to my son.  I have always believed that news aggregators are a new form of media.  Do I need to license them as media, I do not know. <br><br>  It seems to me that Facebook is difficult to adjust to the definition of an aggregator.  Aggregators that collect traffic, like MediaMetrix, are probably the modern types of media.  But whether they need licensing or not, while difficult to say. <br><br>  As far as I know, Yandex shows only licensed media news in the aggregator.  But why additionally license materials that are produced by the media with a license is not clear. </blockquote><br>  Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for the Russian president, <a href="http://www.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/25/02/2016/56cedf319a79476519cd2e3a">believes</a> that there is no need to hurry with any decision: <br><blockquote>  At first it is necessary to work out [this question].  With some kind of dashing cast, of course, probably, solving such complex topics would hardly be right.  There are different points of view, and very reasoned.  To simplify this topic would be illogical. </blockquote>  <a href="https://yandex.ru/blog/company/poslednie-novosti">And the official comment</a> "Yandex". </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298906/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298906/</a></p>
