  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sony Ericsson Xperia Arc - first impressions</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The new Sony Ericsson flagship announced at CES 2011 - the Xperia Arc model in Russia is still present in only two copies, which are now snapped up by the writing, filming and telling about the new features of the gadget market.  I had a chance to twist in my hands and even ride for a couple of hours in Moscow with a novelty. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/a082de66/046a17b8/3e37b84b/fcb00f9c.png"><br>  The most important impression is that the telephone, regardless of all the bells and whistles, remains a telephone ‚Äî it rings, takes calls, and fits in a pocket.  This is by no means a story when a person for a gadget is a person for a gadget.  And about frills - under the cut. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  In terms of dimensions, it is practically Xperia X10 (125x63x8.7 / 10.9 mm vs. 119x63x13 mm), only slightly taller and thinner.  On the front panel, the same three buttons - menu, context menu and back, only in a different order.  On the left is the standard audio jack.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/fbdf24ef/d8e26eb2/5973d345/ed822608.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/11dcec05/3f96d4bd/9c9839a6/3b762977.png"><br><br>  Its lateral location is not so much the cunning intent of designers and engineers as the features of the architecture of the phone.  On the right, there is a MicroUSB connector (do not be intimidated by its ‚Äúsquare‚Äù shape, standard adapters are excellent for it), a volume rocker and a photo / video key. <br><br>  The back cover is made concave - this, at the same time, is a continuation of the tradition of ergonomic cases, which make it easier to fit in the palm of your hand, and a fresh move - before that, the back covers of all Xperia were convex.  Well, I think that this phone‚Äôs concave lid is bigger and thin, like a waist, in the center of the case, it really fits well in your hand. <br><br>  On the lid are the camera's ‚Äúeye‚Äù, the speaker ‚Äî like on all other Xperia, ‚Äúclear‚Äù and loud, and a microphone of the active noise cancellation system that muffles external noise during a conversation ‚Äî you will still hear it, but your interlocutor will not . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/ca0f3da4/e7a19c95/7c48d539/2d320099.png"><br><br>  So, once again, late for work or a meeting, feel free to say ‚ÄúI'm in the subway‚Äù right from your own bathroom, and write off the silence in the phone to a smart phone.  Thanks to the same microphone, the video on the phone can be recorded with full stereo sound. <br><br>  The first pleasant impression is the screen.  Very sensitive, he reacts to any touch and pleases with instant responsiveness.  A diagonal of 4.2 inches with a resolution of 854x480 pixels allows you to place all the necessary widgets on the first desktop screen and practically does not limit the possibilities of web surfing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/51204839/41af511d/dc59bee8/cfd3eb39.png"><br><br>  By the way, the massive distribution of phones with a screen resolution of 800+ in width suggests a story of spiraling history - it would seem that 800-pixel monitors had recently disappeared and websites began to be massively packaged to a standard of 1024 pixels, and then everything was back to its circles - with the only difference that now the user with a screen resolution of 800 pixels is not a dinosaur with an ancient tube monitor, but an advanced user with high purchasing power (which site owners like most). <br><br>  Another feature of the display is rather from the wow effect of owning a model - made using the No air gap technology, which eliminates the air gap between the matrix and protective glass, the arc screen in idle mode has a perfectly black, as if varnished, surface of the display, which merges with the phone .  This is one example of the "fraternal" technological assistance of Sony Corporation, which has already applied this technology in the Monolith series of televisions. <br><br>  Another feature that the creators of Xperia arc are especially proud of is the unique Exmor R matrix with batteries located behind the matrix, which means that they transmit light waves without distortion. <br><br>  About how it works in theory, gives a concept scheme borrowed from Sony Ericsson in secret only for the blog on Habr√©: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/8a6f8b9c/1a5e0768/124764d2/07295115.png"><br><br>  In practice, Exmor R, also known as backlight technology, provides the best quality photography and video in low light conditions. <br><br>  Otherwise, this is a very decent soap dish with an 8.1 megapixel matrix, autofocus, LED flash and the ability to shoot 720p HD video (1280 * 720) at 30 frames per second.  Unfortunately, the camera software on the available samples is not yet final, so taking a photo to boast the quality of the picture, as long as it makes no sense - let's leave it for a full test. <br><br><h4>  Software and management </h4><br>  Sony Ericsson Xperia Arc is working on the latest version of Android at the moment - 2.3 Gingerbread (ginger cookies).  What is the taste of this ‚Äúgingerbread‚Äù in comparison with the ‚Äúeclairs‚Äù of the 2.1 series installed on other Xperia models now can be judged only after a full test, but for those who like dry facts, there is a short description of the changes in Russian <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android">in Wikipedia</a> . <br><br><h4>  Equipment </h4><br>  Xperia arc will be available in two colors - black and silver.  Included with the phone are a 16-gig microSD card, a Micro-USB adapter, charging, in-ear headphones and an HDMI cable for the lucky owners of TVs at home.  Xperia arc will go on sale in March and will cost "flagship" 26-28 tr. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/ebfc1791/a6015682/8080c021/18a13cbb.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/5e93730e/eacdd63a/2a5f6f9b/aeafbabf.png"><br><br><h4>  Summary </h4><br>  Less than two hours later, I took the Xperia arc from the Sony Ericsson office, I was called back and asked to return it back urgently - the new product is in great demand.  Of course, a couple of hours of use is not even a day or two, so while it‚Äôs possible to judge the longevity of the battery and any pitfalls of using the device, only theoretically, but my first impressions are extremely positive - a large and ‚Äúresponsive‚Äù screen, thin and light With such dimensions, the case, interesting - which I just started to study - the stuffing of the new Android.  Nevertheless, a full review will take place, and readers of our blog will find out what it is like to be the owner of the Sony Ericsson Xperia arc - one of the first. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/112497/">https://habr.com/ru/post/112497/</a></p>
