      The studies that led us to this conclusion and the analysis of alternative failure mechanisms are given in the article below. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Introduction </h2><br>  Mayak became the first Russian satellite created by the hands of enthusiasts and launched into orbit.  The success of this project or failure will definitely affect the attitude to projects of this kind, both for space lovers and for the large state-owned space industry.  In addition, the project was carried out through voluntary donations, the method of crowdfunding.  Therefore, we decided to set out as openly as possible our research on the search and analysis of possible causes of equipment failure.  The reason to deal with the reasons for the refusal is also the desire to protect other satellite builders, amateurs and professionals from repeating our mistakes.  Well, to protect against errors, you first need to understand what they are. <br><br>  Separately, I would like to note: this study does not in any way detract from the merits of enterprises of the domestic rocket and space industry.  Moreover, as the head of the Mayak project and the author of this material, I have the deepest respect and gratitude to all the Russian cosmonautics workers who created the modernized Soyuz 2.1a launch vehicle and the wonderful Fregat upper stage, which ensured the launch into our orbit "Mayak" and another 72 small and large vehicles, thereby setting a new Russian record. <br><br><h2>  Chronology of events </h2><br>  <b>May 30, 2016.</b>  The Moscow Polytech began assembling a flight copy of the Mayak satellite and its structurally similar dimensional-mass layout.  Differences from the layout of the flight instance: <br><br><ul><li>  there was no on-board computer, </li><li>  there was no onboard cable network, </li><li>  there were no limit switches controlling the unwinding of the roulettes. </li><li>  the battery was assembled from elements that did not pass preliminary screening tests, </li><li>  the solar reflector was placed inside the solar reflector container in a non-standard manner. </li></ul><br>  The remaining systems are regular. <br><br>  <b>June 15, 2016.</b>  Completed assembly of the flight copy of the ‚ÄúBeacon‚Äù and its overall mass layout. <br><br>  <b>June 20, 2016.</b>  Thermal vacuum tests of the ‚ÄúBeacon‚Äù flight copy with disclosure of the reflector frame in vacuum were successfully carried out. <br><br>  <b>June 25, 2016.</b>  A fitting and flight copy, and a layout in the layout of the <a href="http://ecm-space.de/index.php/deployment-adapters">transport-launch container of the company ECM</a> .  Both copies entered the container, but the spring force was not enough to push the copies out of the container.  Both samples are sent for revision. <br><br>  <b>July 29, 2016.</b>  Successful fitting of the flight copy and the layout to the layout of the transport and launch container of the ECM company was carried out. <br><br>  <b>September 13, 2016.</b>  In NIIEM completed test vibrodynamic tests of the flight copy of ‚ÄúMayak‚Äù.  <a href="http://www.your-sector-of-space.org/gallery/%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F%25D0%25BA-%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BC-1-%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582.pdf">The test</a> report indicating the absence of external defects and signed by the Deputy General Director of NIIEM for Quality S.P.  Skorobogatovym, allowed to obtain admission to the Soyuz-2.1a rocket. <br><br>  <b>September 14, 2016.</b>  During the functional tests of ‚ÄúMayak‚Äù, his refusal was revealed.  The on-board electronics turned out to be without power; there was no voltage at the battery terminals. <br><br>  <b>September 15, 2016.</b>  The flight copy was disassembled, more than half of the contact welding points of the conductors between the battery cells were destroyed.  When analyzing the causes of destruction, it was revealed that the cells had too high mobility inside the battery pack and when excited at their resonant frequency, the conductors between the cells collapsed.  An identical battery was assembled and a small shaker was created, on which resonant frequencies were determined and experimentally, in laboratory conditions, the mechanism of destruction of welding joints was confirmed.  The method of preventing the destruction of welding (see below) was tested on the same vibrostand; the method showed its suitability.  The resonant frequency leading to the destruction of welding points or battery failure could not be identified.  The battery cells were checked individually at the battery analyzer stand (no deviations were detected), and when assembled they were bonded with adhesive bonding to each other, to the boards and to the case of the battery pack using vacuum-resistant epoxy glue VK-9, the conductors between the cells were replaced with more flexible ones and duplicated Thus, each cell of the battery had a 4-fold reservation of contact) and also filled with a layer of VK-9.  Vibrodynamic tests of the assembled battery were successfully carried out on a small vibration table. <br><br>  <b>September 18, 2016.</b>  Completed battery repair.  The battery is charged.  Flight copy assembled. <br><br>  <b>September 19, 2016.</b>  Passed a successful fitting and flight copy, and the layout of the layout of the transport and launch container company ECM. <br><br>  <b>September 22, 2016.</b>  A presentation of the Mayak satellite was held at the Moscow Polytechnic University. <br><br>  <b>March 23, 2017.</b>  Conducted a battery charge check.  The charge was more than 95% of the nominal capacity; no imbalance of the elements was detected. <br><br>  <b>May 10, 2017.</b>  Passed a successful fitting and flight copy, and the layout of the flight transport and launch container company ECM.  The transport container with the flight copy and mockup is sealed and handed over to ‚ÄúGlavkosmos‚Äù for shipment to Baikonur. <br><br>  <b>June 21, 2017.</b>  In the MIK of the site 31 of the Baikonur Cosmodrome, a successful integration of the Beacon flight copy into the ECM company flight-launch container was carried out.  Conducted a battery charge check.  The charge was more than 95% of the nominal capacity; no imbalance of the elements was detected.  On the flight copy of the ‚ÄúMayak‚Äù, located inside the transport and launch container of the ECM company, the control of the limit switches activation and the cyclogram of the on-board equipment operation was successfully carried out. <br><br>  <b>July 14, 2017.</b>  <a href="http://www.iflscience.com/space/russian-scientists-just-launched-a-controversial-artificial-star-that-might-anger-astronomers/">Lighthouse in orbit!</a> <br><br>  <b>August 9, 2017.</b>  <a href="https://spaceflight101.com/soyuz-kanopus-v-ik/mayak-lighthouse-in-the-sky-fails-to-deploy-solar-reflector/">The lighthouse did not open, the search for causes.</a> <br><br>  <b>August 29, 2017.</b>  <a href="http://dauria.ru/news/dauria-ishchet-mka-n">Dauria‚Äôs satellites failed</a> , one LEMUR 2 and one FLOCK 2K <a href="http://spacenews.com/soyuz-launch-customers-search-for-cause-of-cubesat-failures/">were</a> in non-calculated <a href="https://www.space-track.org/">orbits</a> . <br>  In fact, one of the eight ‚ÄúLemurs‚Äù LEMUR 2 ARTFISCHER was in orbit with an apogee of 477 km, in which there are 47 ‚ÄúFlocks‚Äù, although there should have been 48, and one of the ‚ÄúFlocks‚Äù probably did not turn on and was in orbit with apogee of about 605 km, where the remaining seven "Lemurs" are located.  There are 47 FLOCK 2K satellites in the NORAD catalog, while there should have been 48. All 47 are in orbit with an apogee of about 477 km.  There are 8 LEMUR 2 satellites in the NORAD catalog, with 7 satellites in orbit with an apogee of about 605 km, and 1 satellite in an orbit with an apogee of about 477 km.  It looks as if one ‚ÄúLemur‚Äù and one ‚ÄúFlock‚Äù are reversed. <br><br>  <b>August 31, 2017.</b>  <a href="https://lenta.ru/news/2017/09/01/glavkosmos/">Quote from Lenta.ru</a> .  The head of the Glavkosmos launch programs, Vsevolod Kryuchkovsky, explained why several satellites, launched on July 14 by the Russian Soyuz-2.1a rocket, did not get in touch or ended up in an unplanned orbit.  He told his version of what happened to the <a href="http://spacenews.com/glavkosmos-denies-launch-vehicle-caused-cubesat-failures/">Space News</a> publication.  According to Kryuchkovsky, from all foreign customers, Glavkosmos received official confirmation of the successful separation of the satellites from the upper stage of the launch vehicle.  The Roscosmos subsidiary also assured foreign partners that during the separation the rocket was operating normally. <br>  Otherwise, the head of the launch programs of Glavkosmos assesses the situation with the satellites of Russian developers.  ‚ÄúThis is their first experience in the development of Kubsat,‚Äù he said.  ‚ÄúMaybe something happened on the development side, either with components, or with ground stations.‚Äù <br><br>  <b>September 1, 2017.</b>  It turns out that at launch three more Cicero satellites of the American company GeoOptics and one Russian-Ecuadorian UTE-UESOR failed. <br><br>  <b>September 8, 2017.</b>  <a href="https://blog.astrodigital.com/not-nominal-we-lost-2-satellites-23e771a4bc8b">Refused</a> 2 apparatus of the American company Astro Digital. <br><br>  <b>October 5, 2017.</b>  ‚ÄúGlavkosmos‚Äù returned the dimensional-mass layout of the ‚ÄúMayak‚Äù.  It was decided to modify the layout to the flight (identical to the running device) state and to test its strength under the action of loads from transportation and removal, while its battery is modified according to the technology of repair of the flight battery. <br><br>  <b>November 8, 2017</b> .

There were no deviations in the work, all the systems after tests are working normally. <br><br>  <b>Total dry residue:</b> <br><br><ol><li>  By November 25, 2017 it was known about the failures of 10 cubesat out of 19, launched into orbit with a conditional apogee altitude of 600 km; </li><li>  The ‚ÄúMayak‚Äù model, modified by the flight technology, has successfully passed vibrodynamic tests according to the program agreed with Roskosmos and used to allow the ‚ÄúMayak‚Äù to launch vehicle. </li></ol><br><h2>  Analysis of the probable causes of failure of ‚ÄúMayak‚Äù </h2><br>  Conceptually, we can divide the probable causes of failure into internal and external.  Internal depend on the state of the product itself, external - on the impact of external factors on the product. <br><br>  First we analyze in detail the hypotheses about the refusal of ‚ÄúMayak‚Äù for internal reasons, consider the possible measures to check them, then do the same for external reasons. <br><br><h2>  Analysis of the likely internal causes of failure of ‚ÄúMayak‚Äù </h2><br>  Since the Mayak project team created the spacecraft for the first time, it is likely that it could have made mistakes in its development, design and production, which caused a failure in orbit. <br><br><h4>  <i>Known facts to analyze:</i> </h4><br><ol><li>  During vibrodynamic tests of the flight copy of the Mayak spacecraft, a power supply system failure was recorded, which did not affect the design integrity of the device, but resulted in the failure of all onboard equipment. </li><li>  The detected failure of the power supply system was eliminated, technological vibrodynamic tests were carried out, demonstrating the strength of the design of the repaired battery. </li><li>  During the thermal vacuum (TFI) and vibrodynamic (VDI) tests of the flight instance of the Mayak spacecraft, no other failures were found. </li><li>  The overall mass layout of the ‚ÄúBeacon‚Äù was refined to flight condition.  The battery is made on the same technology as the flight copy, by the same staff on the same equipment. </li><li>  Successful vibrodynamic tests were carried out according to the program-method used for admission to the Soyuz-2.1a launch vehicle. </li></ol><br><h4>  <i>Accepted hypotheses</i> </h4><br>  <i>Hypothesis ‚Ññ1.</i>  <i>In real flight, the same system fails as in the tests.</i> <br>  On the spacecraft, even on such a simple as ‚ÄúMayak‚Äù, a lot of different onboard systems. <br><br>  In our case it is: <br><br><ul><li>  Basic structure, </li><li>  on-board electronics, </li><li>  power supply system </li><li>  onboard cable network, </li><li>  reactor engine </li><li>  solar reflector </li><li>  solar reflector opening system. </li></ul><br>  During ground-based experimental testing, when loads were applied to a spacecraft during transportation to Baikonur, via Baikonur, only one system failed during flight on a launch vehicle, detachment from the upper stage and orbital flight, all the others worked normally.  This allows us to conclude that in real flight, under the action of the same loads, the most likely failure of the same system. <br><br>  <i>Hypothesis ‚Ññ2.</i>  <i>In real flight on July 14, 2017, no more than the loads that were subjected to vibrodynamic tests acted.</i> <br><br>  This statement can be confirmed by the fact that most of the spacecraft did not show signs of destruction during orbital flight. <br><br><h4>  <i>Strength study</i> </h4><br>  To test the hypotheses put forward, it was necessary to conduct repeated tests.  Since thermal vacuum tests (TTIs) were carried out on the flight specimen and no problems were found, it was decided not to perform repeated TTIs. <br><br>  The purpose of the research is to experimentally test the strength of a repaired ‚ÄúMayak‚Äù rechargeable battery, similar to that installed on a flight copy, when subjected to vibrations, shocks and overloads, similar to those acting on a spacecraft during transportation to Baikonur, to Baikonur, while flying on a booster rocket and separating from the booster unit, while additionally verify the performance of other systems of the device. <br><br><h4>  <i>Preparation of the test object</i> </h4><br>  The overall mass layout of the ‚ÄúBeacon‚Äù, as mentioned above, differed from the flight instance in the following: <br><br><ul><li>  there was no on-board computer, </li><li>  there was no onboard cable network, </li><li>  there were no limit switches controlling the unwinding of the roulettes. </li><li>  the battery was assembled from elements that did not pass preliminary screening tests, </li><li>  the solar reflector was placed inside the solar reflector container in a non-standard manner. </li></ul><br>  As for the rest, including the operability of the solar reflector deployment system, the layout corresponded to the flight instance. <br><br>  Therefore, to carry out a full-fledged experiment that confirms or disproves the performance of Mayak after it was placed in orbit, it was necessary to install an on-board computer, install an onboard cable network, and assemble a rechargeable battery using flight technology.  The solar reflector inside its container was placed abnormally, since it did not affect the verification of the disclosure process. <br><br>  Before testing, the model worked as follows. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/14RzED-fBu8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  <i>Testing</i> </h4><br>  The tests were conducted in the JSC "NPO IT" at the address 141074, the Russian Federation, Moscow region, Korolev, ul.  Pionerskaya, house 2. This company, by the way, is part of Roscosmos. <br><br>  The tests were carried out according to our already published program <a href="http://www.your-sector-of-space.org/gallery/%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F%25D0%25BA-%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BC-1-%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582.pdf">‚ÄúSpacecraft‚Äú Mayak ‚Äù.</a>  <a href="http://www.your-sector-of-space.org/gallery/%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F%25D0%25BA-%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BC-1-%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582.pdf">The program and methods of testing for static and vibrodynamic strength of the Mayak-VDI-PM-1 ‚Äù</a> , according to which we tested the flight instance of‚Äú Mayak ‚Äùand received an admission to the launch vehicle.  From the program it is clear that its different sections imitate the loads acting on the apparatus at various stages of its life cycle. <br><br>  <i>Transportation apparatus to Baikonur and Baikonur, blows up to 5 g.</i> <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6GUFYoIVKM0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <i>Static overloads reaching 10 g.</i> <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZVBwBZcNjqM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <i>Random vibrations with rms values ‚Äã‚Äãup to 10 g.</i> <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AP90HMOwXNo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <i>Impacts in the separation of the launch vehicle units with an amplitude of up to 40 g</i> <br><br>  Here the strikes were prepared for so long and so quickly passed that I did not have time to shoot them.  But the measurement of the voltage level on the battery did.  Such measurements were carried out after each type of test and did not reveal deviations in the voltage level on the battery. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7m/fn/p8/7mfnp8s0bvntn3ars1leman1yng.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>And, finally, the separation of the ‚ÄúBeacon‚Äù from the upper stage, hit up to 150 g!</i> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p2g_XthQNjw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  I must say that this is an obvious reinsurance, since ‚ÄúMayak‚Äù was pushed out of the container with a soft spring at a speed of about 1 m / s. <br><br>  It is worth adding that before and after the application of loads, measurements of the amplitude-frequency characteristic (AFC) of the layout with the equipment were carried out.  In these measurements, the logic is as follows: if something inside the structure fell off or broke, then it will react differently to vibrations, old resonances change, or new ones will arise. <br><br>  In our case, nothing happened. <br><br>  <i>And finally, the video disclosure of the layout after all the tests.</i> <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YNtDuZoRM1Y" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  <i>Test results</i> </h4><br>  Measuring the voltage level on the battery, measuring the frequency response before and after testing, and, most importantly, checking the disclosure of the layout before and after testing, allow you to state the following: <br><br><ol><li>  The voltage on the battery during the tests was 27.9-28.0 V. </li><li>  Vibrodynamic tests did not affect the performance of on-board electronics. </li><li>  The frequency response during the tests has not changed. </li><li>  Mechanical systems have not undergone changes - the layout is revealed both before and after the tests. </li></ol><br><h4>  <i>Conclusions from the analysis of internal causes of failure</i> </h4><br>  Thus, it can be argued that the layout of the ‚ÄúMayak‚Äù, modified to the flying state according to the technology used in the repair of the flight copy, has successfully passed vibrodynamic tests. <br><br>  We could not find the internal reasons for the failure of ‚ÄúMayak‚Äù.

The normal operation of spacecraft separated before and after dissimilar cubsat speaks in favor of this hypothesis. <br><br>  <i>Hypothesis ‚Ññ2.</i>  <i>The failure of the Kubsat, put into orbit with an approximate apogee of 600 km, is caused by the same reason.</i> <br><br>  This hypothesis is difficult to verify by numerical calculations, since estimates of the probabilities of the failure-free operation of the failed machines are unknown, but it can be assumed that satellites created by different teams in different countries from different components with a low probability simultaneously failed due to their internal causes. <br><br>  <i>Hypothesis ‚Ññ3.</i>  <i>Failure of Kubsat caused by external influence.</i> <br><br>  If the reason for the failure of the Kubsat is the same, then it is logical to assume that this reason is external to the devices themselves.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Devices of different manufacturers, having different designs and on-board systems, failed; they had only in common that they were made in the same Cubesat format and flew on the same rocket. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is no reason to assume that the format of the satellites, their geometrical dimensions and limitations on their design, caused them to fail, so it can be assumed that the cause of the failure lies in their joint flight, first on the launch vehicle and then on the upper stage. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Taking hypothesis # 1 into account, we believe that the process of their separation from the upper stage and the subsequent free flight served as the reason for the refusal.</font></font><br><br><h4> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Possible types of external influences</font></font></i> </h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Consider the possible types of external influence on the cubsat under the division: </font></font><br><br><ul><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Mechanical impact. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Vibrations, shocks, overloads, limited movement.</font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Gas-hydrodynamic effect. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Jets of gas and liquids.</font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Heat exposure. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Intense infrared radiation that causes heating of the irradiated surface.</font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Electromagnetic exposure.

At the same time, the Kanopus-V-IK satellite and the Flying Laptop, TechnoSat, WNISAT-1R, NORSAT-1, and NORSAT-2 microsatellites are significantly farther from the LRE MT than containers with cubesets. This suggests that some of the decomposition products of hydrazine could get onto the cube containers without damaging the ‚ÄúCanopus-V-IC‚Äù and microsatellites located farther from the LPRE MT nozzles. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The degree of probability of this type of accident should also be recognized as low, since even when it hit the outer parts of the containers, the decomposition products of hydrazine with a small degree of probability could damage the censors inside the containers.

It practically excludes hit of products of combustion on payload. In addition, this engine is not duplicated and, therefore, if it fails, the upper stage will lose the ability to perform maneuvers to change the parameters of the orbit. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/n-/5m/8w/n-5m8wy4oavsg8c5s8ftdizhjf4.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Thus, this type of accident can be considered unlikely and excluded from further consideration.</font></font><br><br> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">7.

These chemical compounds are capable of reacting with materials of on-board satellite equipment. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, according to the reference book [12], the ammonia itself also causes corrosion of copper and its alloys.</font></font><br><br><h4> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Conclusions from the analysis of external causes of failure</font></font></i> </h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> The considered events with could lead to the following consequences: </font></font><br><br><ol><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> contamination of the external surfaces of solar cells with the products of the reaction of free radicals formed by the photochemical decomposition of hydrazine and materials of solar cells; </font></font></li><li>        ,       ,          ; </li><li>         ,  ,  . </li></ol><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">These consequences coincide well with the known facts about the status of spacecraft injected into orbit with an approximate apogee of 600 km, which demonstrated either a complete failure without access to a communication session, or transmitted telemetry about a low level of onboard batteries before a complete failure. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Apparently, a complete failure without a connection to the session is explained by the large number of breaks in the electrical circuits in the electrical connectors and / or onboard equipment. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The low level of charge of onboard batteries can be explained by a decrease in the efficiency of conversion of solar radiation into electrical energy due to contamination of the external, illuminated surface of photoelectric converters of solar batteries, and thereby reducing the generation of electrical energy.</font></font><br><br><h4> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Forecasts based on hypotheses</font></font></i> </h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> The described damage mechanism makes it possible to predict the further development of the situation with spacecraft launched into orbit with an approximate apogee of 600 km. </font></font><br><br><ul><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> There may be new announcements of non-switched or failed cubesats immediately after launch, and the declared refusal should have the same signs as those already announced - either full from the very beginning, or partial with transmission before full failure of the telemetric information on low battery level . </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> There may be announcements about the change in the design of the RB ‚ÄúFregat‚Äù or the LRE MT used on it. </font></font></li></ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> The following scenarios are less likely, but possible. </font></font><br><br><ul><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Publication of telemetry data from the ‚ÄúFrigate‚Äù, indicating the failure of one or two LPRE MT. </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Publication of the report of the emergency commission on the analysis of the causes of the accident of the Kubsat in the launch on July 14, 2017, which contains the reason for the refusal described in this document. </font></font></li></ul><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Thus, according to our assumptions given in this study, a possible cause of the failure of ‚ÄúMayak‚Äù and its nine companions may be the ingress of decomposition products of hydrazine from the LRE MT of the Fregat accelerating unit. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The decomposition products entered into a chemical reaction with the structural materials of photovoltaic cells of solar cells, causing their pollution, and with the structural materials of the onboard equipment, causing their corrosion. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Special opinion. </font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The developer of the power supply system Anton Alexandrov said:</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúDespite the fact that we were not able to establish the internal cause of Mayak‚Äôs refusal, I would consider the possibility of the influence of external factors as the last thing. Nevertheless, we are a young and inexperienced team of satellite builders, and in the apparatus itself ‚Äúcivilian‚Äù components are used, albeit the best and proven ones. And, although some of us have experience in designing space technology, and the mastodons of the industry helped us, I believe that the greatest probability of the cause of failure is internal. Defects of soldering or wiring, explosion or marriage of only two adjacent cells of the battery, sticking of the container casements, failure of roulette motors, sticking of limit switches - any of these problems would be enough for our satellite not to work. Yes, we have carried out the tests to the maximum both before launch and after the failure - but the fact that we did not find an internal reason, in the first place,reason to look for it further.
