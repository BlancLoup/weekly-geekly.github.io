Habralu and just interested readers from Habr showed the production of the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/gadgets/94553/">famous miniature voice recorders</a> , video recorders and SMS guard systems, and also conducted a tour of the holy of holies of the company - the department of development and innovation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/154/0f1/453/1540f145353dc9ac12d30a3661ef168f.jpg" width="800" height="477" alt="159.73 KB"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><h4>  Arrived </h4><br>  The ‚ÄúTelesystems‚Äù office is not that close by, getting from the River Station by two buses is something else an adventure, so my friend and I, who came to Habraden in ‚ÄúTelesystems‚Äù specially came from Peter, were even a little late.  At the entrance to the office center, where the Soviet hardening janitor leisurely designed <br>  documents, we encountered the same guests from Habra and together went up to the Telesystem office.

      Opposite the respawn there is a cabinet with product samples - on one of the shelves, next to the Edic voice recorders, you can see the Guinness sticker (clickable): <br><br> <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/egorkotkin/view/221415/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4b3/4d7/55c/4b34d755cbeec9cb032bded3228a4bc5.jpg" width="800" height="600"></a> <br><br>  The certificate itself (the last of the three received since 2004) hangs side by side: <br><br> <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/egorkotkin/view/221409/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bc5/acb/b92/bc5acbb9255f9e20c527ec03f77ff776.jpg" width="800" height="600"></a> <br><br><h4>  Production </h4><br>  The tour began with the department of production, assembly and packaging - they are located under the same roof in a large hall. <br><br>  Actually assembly: <br> <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/egorkotkin/view/221424/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/447/102/b73/447102b7344da206421ed622e57bf58c.jpg" width="800" height="600"></a> <br><br>  testing: <br><br> <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/egorkotkin/view/221427/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2ef/0de/9dd/2ef0de9ddd296b3593e07859999f7f7b.jpg" width="800" height="600"></a> <br><br>  and packing: <br><br> <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/egorkotkin/view/221417/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/094/42f/2ad/09442f2add424edfc17f6cd1ff617099.jpg" width="800" height="600"></a> <br><br>  Some visitors were very businesslike and asked specific questions about production, suppliers, and interested in relations with other companies.  Then they were the first and left, apparently, having received all the information of interest :) <br><br>  Questions from bloggers were more varied - they were interested in literally everything.  Personally, I wondered why Telesystems did not want to expand production, while remaining in a niche of almost manual, piece production.  In response, I heard a comparison with Ferrari - from which, as I understand it, it follows that this niche completely suits them.  It is understandable - the same voice recorders are not <a href="http://telesys.biz/products/price/">cheap</a> . <br><br><h4>  Development </h4><br>  The development department turned out to be a small room compared to the production hall, a person at ten maximum is a normal office in general, if you do not know that there are developing products that even NASA uses.  But more about that - below. <br><br>  Every week they announce a new product - it can be a completely new development, or <br>  update already released. <br><br>  The main "brain" of developers at work: <br><br> <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/egorkotkin/view/221422/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4a7/5c7/84a/4a75c784a5c6d6c42e28051f639cb159.jpg" width="800" height="600"></a> <br><br>  Unlike large companies, there is no large and strong marketing department, which dictates what to do and how, therefore Telesystems is primarily a company of engineers, not managers. <br><br><h4>  Coffee </h4><br>  As promised, after the tour we went over to coffee and cookies - it was already a purely ‚Äúblogger‚Äù part, informal communication about everything. <br><br>  We even started a small discussion on how to make design equipment from Zelenograd at the Apple level: <br><br> <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/egorkotkin/view/221402/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5e9/2a6/e26/5e92a6e26e78f7fcea0b52ba3b232b2a.jpg" width="800" height="600"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/andorro/" class="user_link">andorro is spinning a</a> new development in his hands - a mAVR DVR with a large touch screen, which is not yet on sale: <br><br> <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/egorkotkin/view/221405/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/af5/c77/6e8/af5c776e8b70bdf9705160f52682abb5.jpg" width="800" height="600"></a> <br><br>  - DVR is essentially a video camera, only with a wider specialization - it can not only record video, but also work as part of a security system, etc.  It can be configured to permanently record or trigger from movement.  Thanks to the buffer recording, <a href="http://telesys.biz/products/avr/204/379/">mAVR</a> can record the history of the event - and when triggered, for example, a motion sensor that turns it on, you can see not only the recording from the moment of the alarm, but also the previous few minutes. <br><br>  A very popular thing among motorists is that it is used as a ‚Äúblack box‚Äù in case of, for example, accidents and subsequent clashes with insurance and traffic police.  There is a model with four slots for memory cards with a total volume of 128 gigabytes. <br>  By the way, it is the ‚ÄúMoors‚Äù that use NASA in their space programs - they are satisfied with the ratio of weight and duration and quality of recording.  And with their help, the Colombian police are catching drug lords in their own country. <br><br>  As it turned out, miniature voice recorders and video recorders are also very well known in our special services.  Moreover, "internal organs" are interested in the activities of "Telesystems" not only in terms of the acquisition of their products.  But with all the permissions, the company has everything OK: of course, the same special services have at their disposal more miniature recording devices, but there are no complaints about the civil products of Telesystems.  Moreover, the Edic dictation recording can be used in court thanks to a system of special digital labels, which make an inconspicuous change of the record impossible - which also has the appropriate permission :) <br><br><h4>  Organizational </h4><br>  Still, Zelenograd is not the best place to hold meetings with bloggers, unless you organize a shuttle from the subway.  Therefore, the following such events will be held in Moscow. <br><br>  But the most persistent, from those who got to Zelenograd and then stayed at the coffee-cookie-conversation: <br><br> <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/egorkotkin/view/221401/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4ec/02f/89b/4ec02f89b4110abf843e9a4f9be5901b.jpg" width="800" height="600"></a> <br><br>  In fact, this is not all that we wanted and could tell about the products of Zelenograd craftsmen.  For example, a separate large line of work of the company, decorative lamps, remained behind the scenes, and there, too, there is something to show and what to tell.  And we will definitely do it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/96714/">https://habr.com/ru/post/96714/</a></p>
