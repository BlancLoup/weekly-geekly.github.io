  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The rarest and most expensive programming languages</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It is considered that programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãsuch as Rust, Erlang, Dart, and some others are the rarest in the IT world.  As I select IT specialists for companies, constantly contacting IT specialists and employers, I decided to conduct a personal research and find out if this is really the case.  Information is relevant for the IT market in Russia. <br><br><h2>  Data collection </h2><br>  To gather information, I studied the number of vacancies, the requirements for which required proficiency in languages, as well as the number of resumes with this skill.  I collected the data on Linkedin, on HeadHunter, using the Amazing Hiring service.  I also have personal statistics on applications to my agency. <br><br>  <i>In all, eight languages ‚Äã‚Äãtouched my research.</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Rusty </h3><br>  World statistics: According to <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018">Stackoverflow</a> statistics from 2018, Rust took the first position (third year in a row) in the list of the most favorite languages ‚Äã‚Äãamong developers and the sixth position in the list of the most expensive wages in terms of languages ‚Äã‚Äã($ 69,000 a year). <br>  Despite the fact that the language is quite popular in the world, in Russia it still remains one of the rarest programming languages.

      In key skills, knowledge of Rust was met by 319 specialists on Headhunter and 360 on Linkedin.  However, only 24 developers have positioned themselves on Headhunter as Rust developers.  Behind the scenes it is believed that only two companies in Russia write Rust.  32 companies are offering Rust jobs to Headhunter and 17 to Linkedin. <br><br>  My agency regularly receives applications for Rust developers vacancy.  However, there are so few specialists that I have already had the impression that I am familiar with all the specialists in Rust development in the country.  Therefore, in the case of the Rust language, many candidates interested in the vacancy learn the language in the course of the implementation of the TOR. <br><br><h3>  Erlang </h3><br>  According to the same statistics, <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018">Stackoverflow</a> Erlang does not lag far behind Rust and also got into all sorts of ratings.  In the list of the most favorite languages ‚Äã‚Äãamong developers, Erlang ranks twenty-first, and in terms of salary Erlang immediately follows Rust, taking the seventh position ($ 67,000 a year). <br><br>  There are 67 developer job offers with Erlang knowledge hanging on Headhunter.  Linkedin - 38. If we talk about the number of summaries, Erlang‚Äôs direct knowledge of the key language (as indicated in the title) was met by only 55 developers at Headhunter, and 38 specialists by Erlang met at Linkedin. <br><br>  Moreover, there is a tendency instead of Erlang developers to hire guys who own the developed Google Go or Golang, because there are more, and the salary is lower.  However, my personal opinion (based on the data of my agency) - Go will not oust Erlang, because for really high-loaded and complex projects, Erlang is an indispensable language. <br><br><h3>  Haxe </h3><br>  Mainly used in game development.  Practically there are no vacancies (literally one on Headhunter).  In LinkedIn, only two companies require knowledge of this language.  If we talk about the proposal - almost two hundred developers pointed to Linkedin knowledge of this language, Headhunter - 109, 10 of them carried knowledge of Haxe in the name of the resume.  It turns out that the Haxe programming language is of little demand in the Russian market.  Supply exceeds demand. <br><br><h3>  Dart </h3><br>  Invented by Google.  Language is becoming more and more popular in the market.  There are 8 vacancies on Headhunter, on Linkedin - 8, however, employers do not require this language in the list of key skills.  The main condition is a large background in Javascript and a competent approach to solving problems. <br><br>  The number of developers familiar with the programming language is 275, but again, only 11 people consider Dart their main skill.  On Linkedin, 124 people somehow mentioned the language in their resumes. <br><br>  Personal experience and statistics of my agency declare that this language is already used by large IT companies.  This suggests that soon he will be excluded from the list of rare programming languages.  By the way, experts who know the language of Dart, "stand" on the market is expensive. <br><br><h3>  F # </h3><br>  Rare enough programming language.  Developed by Microsoft.  In Russia, only a few companies (12 on HH and 7 on Linkedin) request the F # programmer.  In other cases, knowledge of the language is optional.  By the way, the number of developers with knowledge of F # is gradually increasing.  The language has even appeared in the latest <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018">Stackoverflow</a> ranking.  He ranks ninth in the list of the most favorite languages ‚Äã‚Äãamong developers, and in terms of wages, he was the first ($ 74,000 a year). <br><br>  If we talk about the number of published summaries, there are 253 at Headhunter, but very few experts consider F # as the main language.  Only three people brought out the knowledge of F # in the title of the resume.  On Linkedin, the situation is similar: 272 developers mentioned F # in their portfolios, only six of them mentioned F # in the post. <br><br><h2>  The statistics are as follows: </h2><br>  The total number of vacancies is 122 on Headhunter and 72 on Linkedin.  The most popular language among those studied is Erlang.  More than 50% of companies request knowledge of Erlang.  Haxe turned out to be the least popular language.  They look for specialists with Haxe knowledge of 1% and 3% of companies on Headhunter and Linkedin, respectively. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/738/6e1/10a/7386e110a231d1be7b5f3864fce7ea69.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ac5/500/0cb/ac55000cb67ea6dbf0c394bef503d584.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The number of published resumes is almost the same.  Of the 1644 headhunter summaries published, more than forty percent (688) belong to Erlang, the smallest summaries (7%) were posted by specialists with the Haxe development skill.  Linkedin data is slightly different.  Least of all the resume published guys owning Dart.  Of the 1894 portfolios, only 124 belong to the Dart development. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/32e/49e/068/32e49e068dd4664f775f76ec795c2f26.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/af4/6f1/394/af46f13940a1f838e2f1fc4be94943c4.png" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Opa, Fantom, Zimbu </h3><br>  I decided to unite all these three languages ‚Äã‚Äãinto one point for one simple reason - truly rare languages.  There are no vacancies and almost no resume.  You can count on the fingers of developers who have indicated any of these languages ‚Äã‚Äãin their skills. <br><br>  Since these languages ‚Äã‚Äãare not included in the annual report of Stackoverflow, nor are they found in vacancies, I will write a few words about what languages ‚Äã‚Äãit is. <br><br>  <b>Opa</b> - web programming language, trying to replace immediately HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP.  Developed in 2011.  Opa is free and is currently only available for 64-bit Linux and Mac OS X platforms. <br><br>  <b>Fantom</b> is a general purpose language that is compiled into the Java Runtime Environment, JavaScript, and .NET Common Language Runtime.  Developed in 2005. <br><br>  <b>Zimbu</b> is a unique and specific language that can be used to develop almost anything: from GUI applications to OS kernels.  At the moment it is considered an experimental language, not all functions of which are developed. <br><br>  In addition to programming languages, I also included a <b>cyber security specialist</b> in the list <b>.</b>  The number of vacancies compared with the number of resumes is small (about 20).  It turns out, the supply exceeds the demand (as is the case with Haxe), which is quite unusual for the IT sphere.  The salary of information security specialists is low.  For example, in St. Petersburg an experienced cyber security specialist is offered 80-100 thousand rubles. <br><br>  My small research showed that the ‚Äútop‚Äù languages ‚Äã‚Äãfor development are: Rust, Erlang, Dart - there is demand, high salary.  Haxe, Opa, Fantom, Zimbu turned out to be in low demand.  F # is popular abroad, the Russian IT market has not yet captured the language. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/452186/">https://habr.com/ru/post/452186/</a></p>
