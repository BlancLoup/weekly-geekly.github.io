German Klimenko will sell his stake (42%) to Aleksandra Ordzhonikidze, managing director of the publication.  According to the company <a href="http://www.finam.ru/">"Finam"</a> , the cost of the company is 320 million rubles. <br><br>  3DNews was launched in 1997.  Until 2003, its only owner was Andrey Kuzin.  Then Herman Klimenko bought 50% of the publication.  After that, he offered to give 8% of the shares to Alexandra Ordzhonikidze on condition that she would remain the project manager.  And now, after 13 years, she, as if by a twist of fate, becomes the main owner.  She will own 58%. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  3DNews Daily Digital Digest is the first independent Russian online publication dedicated to digital technologies, <a href="http://www.3dnews.ru/">the</a> publication‚Äôs <a href="http://www.3dnews.ru/">website</a> says.

      Herman Klymenko will no longer manage and own other assets belonging to him.  He will give a part in management to his son ‚ÄîYury Klimenko, and a part he will sell.  Accounting and auditing of assets will be carried out by mother‚Äôs company, German Klimenko. <br><br>  Also among its Internet assets is the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/LiveInternet">Liveinternet</a> blog platform, which he launched in 2003.  According to him, there is already a buyer for the site, but his son, Yury Klimenko, will manage the project. <br><br>  In March 2014, Klimenko launched the <a href="http://mediametrics.ru/rating/ru/online.html">Mediametrics</a> news aggregator, where you can see links to the most popular news stories from users of social networks.  Legal entity service is not executed.  According to "Finam" resource may cost about 210 million rubles.  There is also a potential buyer for this resource, but Herman Klimenko assumes that he will give it to his son as well. <br><br>  The President of the Russian Federation signed a <a href="http://www.kremlin.ru/acts/news/51137">decree</a> appointing Herman Klimenko as his adviser.  Putin <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/22880/">offered</a> him to take this position on December 22, 2015, at the Internet Economy forum.  Then Klimenko served as Chairman of the Council of the Institute for Internet Development ( <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4_%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582-%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2">IRI</a> ). <br><br>  According to Article 11 of the Law ‚ÄúOn the Fundamentals of the Civil Service of the Russian Federation,‚Äù Herman Klimenko, after being appointed presidential adviser, is not entitled to ‚Äúengage in other paid activities other than teaching, research, and other creative activities;  engage in business personally or through proxies, receive royalties for publishing and acting as a public servant. ‚Äù <br><br>  Klimenko Jr. <a href="http://izvestia.ru/news/601824">told</a> Izvestia that he was interested in all of his father‚Äôs projects: <br><blockquote>  All that is is a valuable asset for us: they give traffic and statistics show.  They will develop.  There are ideas for the development of Liveinternet, we have already discussed them before my father was appointed advisor to the president.  It is necessary to evaluate and understand what is more profitable: to make new projects, or to optimize existing ones.  I'm not ready to say on the go.  All projects that exist today, we will develop and improve them.  They employ competent people, excellent specialists.  I'm sure everything will be fine. </blockquote><br>  The president of the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superjob">SuperJob</a> recruiting portal, Alexei Zakharov, suggested that Klimenko would legally transfer his business to his son, but he would continue to make key decisions himself. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297956/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297956/</a></p>
