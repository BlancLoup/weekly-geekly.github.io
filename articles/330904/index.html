This is the EPAM conference, where speakers share knowledge, listeners ask questions and get answers, get to know each other and travel in virtual reality. <br><br>  The speakers of #ITsubbotnik are EPAM engineers who cannot but share their experiences with others.  They tell not only about successes, but also about what rakes they attacked and how they coped with problems. <br><br>  And their reports are always about the future: they talk about new approaches and tools, which soon are likely to become familiar everyday life for many.

Speakers of #ITsubbotnik told how what they are doing today can change the world in five years. <br><br><h3>  Houses will become smarter and safer </h3><br>  <b>Sergey Chibirev</b> , Android developer.  The topic of the report is ‚ÄúSmart Home Do It Yourself‚Äù. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIf we ask the first comer today what a smart home is, we will most likely get the answer that it‚Äôs expensive and it‚Äôs an unnecessary luxury.  Such systems are really not cheap, but not because they are complex, but because they are being lobbied by certain manufacturers.  They are sold as a luxury. <br><br>  Somewhere in 2005 there was a technical breakthrough that made the smart home affordable.  Now you can do it yourself, without overpaying, and at the conference we told how. <br><br>  It is becoming more and more difficult to conceal that such systems are cheap, and soon these technologies will step into our homes.  For example, I enter the apartment, the door opens, I don‚Äôt need a key: the system has recognized it.  She greets me with a voice message and answers my voice commands, turns on my favorite music, lights the light.  It maintains the desired temperature and humidity level in the house.  In general, it creates an environment in which I feel as comfortable as possible.  Such technologies are already available.  As long as people treat them like luxury, they will soon get used to it. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/ced/6d7/724/ced6d7724ac04d3cb3f4be633be02e27.gif"><br><br>  <b>Andrei Ortyashov</b> , Android developer.  The topic of the report is ‚ÄúSmart Home Do It Yourself‚Äù. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like to think, but it seems to me that the Internet of things will develop rapidly due to its cheapness and accessibility.  Probably, in every home in five years there will be ‚Äúsmart‚Äù elements.  Not all apartments will have, for example, a system for opening and closing curtains, as it will seem unprofitable to many.  But some basic things - turn off the power, turn off the electric stove, get a signal due to a gas leak - will appear in homes.  Often in our country there are explosions of domestic gas due to the fact that the leak was not recorded in time.  At the same time, the systems that can register such cases and notify tenants are rather cheap and simple. ‚Äù <br><br><h3>  People will have more free time. </h3><br>  <b>Dmitry Nikitko</b> , data analyst.  The topic of the report is ‚ÄúNeural networks for extracting structured information from documents‚Äù. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI talked about how to use deep neural networks to extract structured information from documents with a different pattern.  For example, we have the usual checks from the store.  They differ from each other, but the main data set in them is the same, for example, everywhere there is a total amount.  But in different checks it is located in different places.  To extract and structure this information, we used neural networks. <br><br>  I think that in the next five years it is worth waiting for the emergence of high-performance processors for training more complex systems.  Neural networks will be able to free people from routine work.  There will be more time to do your favorite things. <br><br>  Those who work in this area are skeptical of claims that artificial intelligence will enslave us, as shown in the films.  It all depends on what function we optimize.  If we talk about people as neural networks, they tend to maximize their pleasure and avoid pain.  If you train a neural network on a similar principle and try to maximize the computing power that is available to it, who knows what will happen?  But I think everything will be fine. " <br><br><h3>  We will do more spontaneous shopping. </h3><br>  <b>Dmitry Yatsyuk</b> , DevOps-engineer.  The topic of the report is ‚ÄúComplete integrated infrastructure solution for Hadoop Big data and AWS with Cloudera CDH 5.x‚Äù. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe decision I was talking about is designed for large retail customers.  What will it change in five years?  Perhaps we will buy more: we will actively offer, recommendations will become more accurate.  This is happening now: we go, for example, to Yandex.Market and buy something that we haven‚Äôt even thought about.  The more data experts analyze, the more accurate the recommendations become: whether it's food or a song on a social network. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/bf5/289/d27/bf5289d2777e469c992ebb53071c2c57.gif"><br><br><h3>  Cards in clinics will cease to disappear </h3><br>  <b>Sergey Chernolyas</b> , Java developer.  The topic of the report is ‚ÄúJPA for NoSQL‚Äù. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe organization of databases, both relational and non-relational, will be improved, and automation will greatly affect the financial sector, telecom, medicine and more.  For example, in hospitals where medical records are not yet entered into electronic databases, they will begin to do this and they will not be lost. ‚Äù <br><br><h3>  Artificial intelligence will test artificial intelligence </h3><br>  <b>Anton Shapin</b> , automated testing engineer.  The topic of the report is ‚ÄúVisualization, storage, and storage, using Grafana and InfluxDB‚Äù. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIn five years everything will change: the IT world changes every month.  In QA, one way or another, there will be a problem when working with large amounts of data and when testing artificial intelligence.  Many companies go into the field of developing artificial intelligence and neural networks.  How to test all this, unfortunately, is not entirely clear.  To test artificial intelligence, you need another artificial intelligence.  Developing these methodologies is a big challenge to the QA community. <br><br>  Manual testers will not completely disappear, because the machine is a machine, and who creates the tests?  Person.  In addition, there are areas that are very expensive to check automatically, where it makes no sense to invest a lot of money. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/397/cb6/602/397cb66022824ff981144597f58979de.gif"><br><br>  <b>Roman Iovlev</b> , automated testing engineer.  The topic of the report is ‚ÄúJava edge in test automation‚Äù. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAutomators are trying to simplify the routine work of the manual testers, and the work of the automatists themselves can also be improved.  I am sure that in the future testing will increasingly use the capabilities of artificial intelligence and functional business models and to a lesser extent will be associated with writing code.  There will be powerful libraries or tools that can decide for themselves what scripts, data sets and testing approaches are needed.  And the tester will only determine what is required of the system. ‚Äù <br><br><h3>  Companies will be able to quickly receive product feedback. </h3><br>  <b>Roman Dimitrenko</b> , DevOps Engineer.  The topic of the report is ‚ÄúBuilding PaaS with the HashiStack‚Äù. <br><br>  ‚ÄúContinuous integration and continuous delivery is what drives any business now and contributes to rapid changes.  If we talk about websites, then the time from the decision to add new functionality to the site before its implementation is significantly reduced.  In a fully automated environment, it is no longer a matter of hours, but of minutes.  Everything will be faster, operator intervention and manual work is not required. <br><br>  With the help of the products I mentioned, business owners will be able to receive feedback faster than they are now: whether their product is working or not, whether it brings money to the company or not. ‚Äù <br><br><h3>  A new type of network search will be available. </h3><br>  <b>Mikhail Khludnev</b> , a specialist in search engines.  The topic of the report is ‚ÄúSearch LIKE% SQL%‚Äù. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI talked about searching by substring.  This is more complicated than regular keyword search.  For the whole word, everyone can search, but not in part: it is very long.  I presented a method for instantly finding huge arrays of documents on substrings.  What will change in five years?  This type of search will be available to everyone.  Any grandmother can search for a substring.  It seems to me that it is very convenient to search for information from the social security office. ‚Äù <br><br><h3>  It will be more convenient to store data </h3><br>  <b>Stepan Rakitin</b> , Java developer.  The topic of the report is ‚ÄúWe create fault-tolerant distributed applications with Atomix‚Äù. <br><br>  ‚ÄúNow there are very few databases that are designed for big data and comply with the principle of‚Äú strong consistency ‚Äù, in which the data must be in the only accepted state among all nodes of the cluster.  I believe that in the coming years, data storage systems will be actively developed to ensure fault tolerance.  The data will be up to date on all servers. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/02b/bcb/6be/02bbcb6be4d44b6281df1f276c840a38.gif"><br><br><h3>  Applications will become cheaper and better. </h3><br>  <b>Rustam Kadyrov</b> , Java developer.  The topic of the report is ‚ÄúHow to rein in the zoo from microservices‚Äù. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWhat will change in five years with this technology?‚Äù  Regular users will feel that online services have become cheaper and better.  They are still available, but the microservice architecture allows cheaper infrastructure for their use.  That is, if you organize everything correctly, you can spend less money on infrastructure support.  Due to this architecture, you can make the delivery of new functionality faster, and the development time of the application will be reduced. <br><br>  New algorithms, neural networks and more efficient use of technologies that already exist will make the work of services faster and better.  Voice assistants and online translators will become smarter. ‚Äù <br><br><h3>  The clouds will have a worthy competitor </h3><br>  <b>Andrey Filatov</b> , DevOps Engineer.  The topic of the report is ‚ÄúEnsemble of salty chefs: compare Ansible, SaltStack and Chef‚Äù. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIn my report, I compared the three leading, in my opinion, SCM systems: Chef, Ansible and SaltStack.  In a short time, it seems to me, the operation will be almost completely automated.  The profession of a system administrator who manages services in manual mode will probably simply cease to exist.  Only those who use configuration management systems in automatic mode will remain.  And perhaps all of us will be replaced by neural networks that will generate code and manage the infrastructure.  This will not happen in the near future, but if we talk about the long run, it is quite possible. <br><br>  Now my personal favorites are docker containers and infrastructure management using containerization.  Using cloud services and containerization solves the same tasks, but in different ways.  Containers, for example, are more productive than clouds. ‚Äù <br><br><h3>  It will take more non-functional testers </h3><br>  <b>Sergey Mishanin</b> , automated testing engineer.  The topic of the report is ‚ÄúReport Portal.  A Guide for Cucumber Adepts. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI have been working in software testing for 10 years, of which I have been doing automation for 9 years.  When I first started working in this area, automation seemed innovative.  Nine years have passed, and it would seem that it should already be everywhere, but this is not yet the case.  We have successfully completed the Agile stage, when everything is fast, dynamic, there is no time and resources for manual testing.  The need for such testers will decrease.  Analytics will be in demand, but tests should be performed automatically.  It seems to me that in five years automation will be everywhere.  In addition, if now we are talking about test automation, we usually mean functional tests.  I think that the need for non-functional testing will evolve rapidly.  This performance, security and not only.  The Internet of Things is coming to our world, and cars will have to communicate with cars even more. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Denis Klykov</b> , stress testing engineer.  The topic of the report is ‚ÄúVisualization, storage, and storage, using Grafana and InfluxDB‚Äù. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI believe that the field of load testing has a great future.  In the past five years, there have been more projects where customers pay a lot of attention to non-functional software requirements.  Business is beginning to understand that speed and other performance characteristics of IT systems are important for increasing profits and attracting investments.  If earlier load testing services were in demand only from financial, telecommunication companies and Internet giants, now they are in demand in the retail, multimedia, oil and gas sector.  And this means that load testing specialists will be increasingly needed by the market. ‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/330904/">https://habr.com/ru/post/330904/</a></p>
