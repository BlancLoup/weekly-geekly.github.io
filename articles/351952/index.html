The simple entrepreneur will turn gray if he begins to independently understand the manuals of the regulatory authorities on the selection of equipment, and then all this marketing presentation is spattered from the sellers of equipment all over the Internet.  So, let's understand what the TSD for the Unified State Automated Information System is. <br><br><img title="The collection terminal given for USAIS should read 2D code" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/l-/dh/sn/l-dhsnllkzmukruoxkhvg_of8s8.png" alt="   Honeywell EDA50K  2D " width="550"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Common myth about TSD for USAIS </h2><br>  In preparing this article, we pomonitorili, and what our colleagues (equipment vendors) write about terminals for USAIS.  Which advise why, by what criteria.  What do their segmented product offerings, etc. look like?  Putting ourselves in the place of an entrepreneur who wants to buy a TSD to work with the Unified State Automated Information System, we did not envy him. <br>  For example, one of the scary stories on one of the sites: <br><br><blockquote>  <i>‚ÄúThe data collection terminal for USAIS is a device equipped with a 2D scanning module and integrated with special software for checking the legality of alcoholic beverages - CheckMarkII, developed by the Federal State Unitary Enterprise‚Äú Centrinform ‚Äù.</i> <i>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"

        </script>
      <br>
    </i>  <i>Not every data collection terminal for the Unified State Automated Information System declared for work is integrated with this software, so ask the seller for an official letter from Centrinform confirming the successful passing of testing of a specific TCD model for the Unified State Automated Information System with CheckMarkII software.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>We have two manufacturers who have prepared the Data Collection Terminal for the Unified State Automated Information System and successfully passed the testing, which is documented. "</i> <br></blockquote>  Formulated categorically, is not it?  Let's figure it out. <br><blockquote>  <i>"The data collection terminal for the Unified State Automated Information System is a device equipped with a 2D scanning module"</i> </blockquote>  - absolutely right.  To work in USAIS, a device is required with the ability to scan a code on an excise stamp, and there we currently have PDF417 and DataMatrix, which are read only by a 2D scanner. <br><br>  By the way, three days ago, Rosalkogolregulirovanie delighted the alcohol market with another <a href="http://egais.ru/news/view%3Fid%3D1540">news</a> , in addition to the introduction of the EGAIS 3.0 format, introduces a new type of excise stamps, which will only have one DataMatrix barcode: <br><br><img title="Updated model of excise stamps from 07/01/2018" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/x7/vh/wh/x7vhwhs4pqebavi3m0igw4irlci.png" alt="     01.07.2018"><br><br>  This, I must say, the news "so-so."  On the one hand, two data contours are combined into one, and on the other hand, this leads to smaller and more difficult to read code, which scanners and terminals can handle with very sensitive optics.  How the devices at the disposal of enterprises will behave, whether they will be suitable for stable reading of such a bar code, and what the necessary modernization of the technical park of alcoholics will cost is hardly thought upstairs. <br><br>  <b>So yes.</b>  <b>TSD for USAIS is a 2D scanner with a 2D scanner.</b> <br><br>  We read a terrible tale further: <br><blockquote>  <i>"... and integrated with special software for checking the legality of alcoholic beverages - CheckMarkII, developed by FSUE" Centrinform ""</i> </blockquote>  And here we are ready to argue about the obligatory nature of this condition. <br><br><h2>  What is the TSD integrated with CheckMark2? </h2><br>  CheckMark2 or Mobile Check Marks software from FSUE ‚ÄúCentrinform‚Äù is a program for checking the legality of the turnover of alcoholic beverages using a mobile <a href="https://scanport.ru/equipment/terminaly-sbora-dannyx/">TSD</a> .  The program is designed to compare the information contained in the barcode of the federal special or excise stamp with the database of the FS PAP.  The result obtained is displayed on the screen of the device in order to further visual comparison with the information contained on the bottle and FSM / AM.  Use of this software is possible only on a specially configured and registered in the prescribed manner TSD. <br><br>  There are a number of terminal models (very limited) that have been tested for work with this software and have received the ‚Äúrecommended for use‚Äù status from Centrinform.  The procedure was voluntary, which was used by equipment manufacturers in the first wave of the Unified State Automated Information System.  Marketing, it brought dividends, some terminals were placed on the website of Centrinform in the recommended equipment section. <br><br>  <b>So yes.</b>  <b>TSD, integrated with CheckMark2 - suitable for work in USAIS.</b> <br><br>  What about a DSD with a 2D scanner, but NOT integrated with CheckMark2?  And here we begin to separate flies from cutlets. <br><br><img title="TSD for USAIS should not be integrated with CheckMark2 without fail" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tr/5l/lm/tr5llmvar71kokers5oi1p1pqci.jpeg" alt="        CheckMark2   "><br><br><h2>  Is it possible to work with EGAIS terminal without CheckMark2? </h2><br>  We answer immediately - it is possible.  And what's important is allowed.  There are no restrictions for working with EGAIS, if you have a TSD without CheckMark2, nobody imposes. <br><br>  CheckMark2 is a program whose only function is to check the legality of the excise stamp.  For example, the merchandiser scans all or selectively bottles from the received batch and visually on the screen of the TSD sees confirmation of the legality of the brand.  There is no information as to whether this bottle should be shipped to his company.  Further, the terminal acceptors accept the goods on the instructions, while using other software for inventory purposes.  It should be noted that the terminal for working with CheckMark2 can be registered in Centrinform only from the attached list (6 models) and each of these <a href="https://scanport.ru/equipment/terminaly-sbora-dannyx/terminaly-korporativnogo-klassa/Zebra%2520MC67/">TSD should have a 3G module</a> (the cost of these models is about 100 thousand rubles per piece).  Next, an application for registration of the TSD is submitted to the PAP FS, which is considered under the rules for up to 30 days.  After approval, this terminal must be added to the company's personal account in the PAR FS system.  If the terminal fails, you will have to buy a new one and go through the entire registration procedure again. <br><br><img title="The registration procedure for TSD in the FS RAR takes up to 30 days" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ul/rb/1s/ulrb1sqj_0x7iqcbvocbiypya64.jpeg" alt="        30 "><br><br>  The Mobile Check Marks software from Federal State Unitary Enterprise Tsentrinform (CheckMark2) is a tool for checking the validity of marks, and its purpose is to help the entrepreneur to do this using <a href="https://scanport.ru/equipment/terminaly-sbora-dannyx/">the data collection terminal</a> .  But the use of this program is not a prerequisite when working with EGAIS.  At the moment, software developers for warehouse automation and retail offer solutions <a href="http://data-mobile.ru/datamobile-egais/">with checking the validity of brands</a> directly in the process of accounting and retail operations, without using the CheckMark2 module. <br><br><h2>  How to work with USAIS on the data collection terminal without CheckMark2? </h2><br>  So, we figured out that to work with EGAIS requires a terminal with a 2D scanner, and this is necessary.  As for the rest (as we wrote in the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/scanport/blog/351374/">article about scanners for USAIS</a> ), the choice of equipment model is determined only by your conditions of use, requirements of business processes and budget.  And here it is worth making a reservation that the TSD is just a piece of hardware, which requires specialized <a href="http://data-mobile.ru/">mobile software</a> . <br><br>  We described the DataMobile EGAIS products earlier in a <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/scanport/blog/349820/">separate article</a> . <br><br>  Here I would like to add that with the full transition to blot accounting according to the EGAIS 3.0 format, there is no need to check the legality of alcohol at the acceptance stage.  In TTH 3.0, all excise stamps have already been entered, which should be in delivery, respectively, they have already been tested in the PAP FS system at the production stage.  Distributor, wholesaler or store need only check the marks from the consignment note document with the actual arrival.  This can make any TSD with a 2D scanner. <br><br><img title="In USAIS 3.0, there is no need to check the legality of alcohol at the acceptance stage" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wr/wh/dz/wrwhdzmodfpnlabes-zh0uokili.jpeg" alt="  3.0         "><br><br>  During the transition period, when there is still a possibility of movement of products on batch accounting ( 2.0), there is a need to check such excise taxes for validity and ‚Äúspecularity‚Äù (lack of sales for a specific bottle) in order not to aggravate responsibility for selling alcohol to the final consumer.  Therefore, the <a href="http://data-mobile.ru/datamobile-egais/">DataMobile EGAIS</a> program retains the relevance of the ‚Äúbackground‚Äù brand verification tool.  The receiver accepts the goods, scans all the stamps with any <a href="https://scanport.ru/equipment/terminaly-sbora-dannyx/terminaly-korporativnogo-klassa/HoneywellEDA50K/">TSD with 2D</a> , all the marks are transferred to a separate buffer of the accounting system and are automatically checked in the background on the FS PAP server.  This check is performed by sending data for checking to the PAP server and does not require the use of the CheckMark2 module.  Accordingly, it is possible to use the simplest terminal with the DataMobile EGAIS software, even offline versions (for example, we offer a complete set of " <a href="https://scanport.ru/equipment/complekty-avtomatizacii/sklad-invent-priemka-peremehenie/SkladProEGAIS/">Warehouse PRO EGAIS</a> ", which includes the TCD with software, from 36 thousand rubles) <br><br><h2>  What else can you recommend to an entrepreneur to work with excise stamps? </h2><br>  For retail, in the <a href="http://data-mobile.ru/datamobile-egais/">DataMobile UGAIS software</a> there is the possibility of automatic unloading of all verified brands in Frontol AlcoUnit.  <a href="https://scanport.ru/equipment/programmnoe-obespechenie/po-atol/Frontol%2520Alco%2520Unit/">Frontol AlcoUnit</a> is an alcohol control software at the checkout that will protect the store owner from unreasonable fines.  The software allows you to check the brand before sending the sale report to the server of the FS PAP, reports whether the brand consists on the balance sheet of your enterprise or not. <br><br>  What is it for?  This is protection from unscrupulous sellers on the trading floor, who are not averse to haggling with their alcohol, bought "around the corner."  Such alcohol may not be counterfeit, but the profit from the sale is already in the pocket of the thief.  Also, often the retail takes TTN "in confidence" and alcohol comes without checking the validity.  This may occur due to various reasons, for example, there is not enough time to receive goods with scanning each bottle.  In this case, Frontol AlcoUnit will become an additional barrier so that the retail store will not be subject to claims from the regulatory authorities if the fact of sale at the checkout will have any inconsistencies with the EGAIS system. <br><br><img title="Frontol AlcoUnit protects shop owner from unreasonable fines" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uw/vg/2a/uwvg2aqpofbuxjzn8sqnpn-_164.jpeg" alt="Frontol AlcoUnit      "><br><br><h2>  In custody </h2><br>  Work with alcohol products in the EGAIS system, with its updates, additions and innovations - this is already a test for honest entrepreneurs.  I don‚Äôt want the honest business to be fed with bikes about the fact that it is necessary to buy equipment for 100 thousand rubles, wait for the registration of the TSD in the system for 30 days, and work only with strictly defined software.  The choice of <a href="https://scanport.ru/equipment/terminaly-sbora-dannyx/gotovye-komplekty-tsd-s-po-vklyuchil-i-rabotaj/komplekty-tsd-dlya-sklada-i-magazina-s-egais/">TSD for USAIS is</a> not limited by anything except the type of scanning module.  And choosing TSD, remember the need for mobile software for <a href="https://scanport.ru/equipment/terminaly-sbora-dannyx/">TSD and work with EGAIS</a> .  The choice of such software also has no restrictions on the part of FS PAP. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/351952/">https://habr.com/ru/post/351952/</a></p>
