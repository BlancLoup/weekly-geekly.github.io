  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The combination of work and freelancing</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I started my career as a programmer a few years ago, trying my skills as a freelancer, while combining this business with my studies.  Now I remember those sleepless nights with a hint of nostalgia and a quiver over the skin.  In stable work, of course, there are many advantages, among which is the measured pace of life.  But one day all this idyll was destroyed by the message of the former colleague who offered to help him with the project for a certain fee.  All anything, but his company had to do exactly the same as the company for which I now work.  Before me was the question of how to get out of this situation, without questioning your good name, and at the same time gain useful experience. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At first, I was skeptical about this event, because I had long forgotten what remote work is.  It was also not clear how my employer would react to this, despite the fact that I have been on good terms with him for more than a year.  But when I looked at it from the other side, I realized that a business can become very profitable for all parties - I will get a new (and not least important, well-paid) experience, my employer is an employee‚Äôs development (which just will need to pay), and a colleague who decided to start his own business - a programmer who has already solved his problems of interest. <br><br>  At first I decided that I had <b>to inform the employer that I would work on the project with a similar focus</b> .  Make it clear your loyalty to your current job and explain that this in no way threatens the company's confidential data.  In my case, I also discussed the possibility of using ‚Äúon the side‚Äù useful future tools, which finally convinced me to give a blessing for parallel work.  Maybe this point could have been missed, but it brought a certain calm to this situation. <br><br>  Next, perhaps the most important point - <b>understand where the line is located, beyond which are the intellectual property of the campaign</b> .  This applies to both the employer and the third-party source of income.  <b>In no case do not disclose inside information and details to a third party.</b>  Even in an informal conversation.  Even if someone is very interesting.  This is fraught with the saddest consequences.  From the loss of a job to badly laundered stains on their reputation.  Try not to discuss this type of activity with a third party at all. <br>  Remember, the implementation of the solution of the problem is the property of the company for which it was created.  But no one can forbid you to use the same methods and principles to solve a similar problem.

      <b>Keep a balance between the already studied and the new.</b>  As for me, this is the most pleasant part.  If scripts and libraries created at work cannot be used in freelance work, then this problem does not arise with open-source libraries.  But do not rush to go trodden road.  If your time is already paid in any case, then this is a good opportunity to look for alternative methods for solving already known problems (this was meant by ‚Äúfuture useful tools‚Äù).  This can be not only a useful experience, but also a weighty addition to the resume. <br><br>  I hope that if you find yourself in a similar situation, this article will help you to succeed everywhere and find a solution that benefits each side.  I wish you all to end, as in my case, happy ending. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297136/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297136/</a></p>
