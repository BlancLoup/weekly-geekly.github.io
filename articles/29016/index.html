Having a well-dressed character at a high level was terribly honorable.  This game has become a real breakthrough. <br>  Fight Club from the very beginning became the micromodel of our world - strong and weak, courtiers and policemen, the rich, beggars and even courtesans.  And more binding laws.  And capital punishment.  It means that there must be those who, for personal gain, virtual or real, will try to circumvent the laws. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>BIRTH OF SNOW</strong>

      <em>In the beginning was the word ...</em> <br><br>  It's simple.  Two blows - "head" and "groin", and two blocks - "head and legs" and "groin-body".  There is no block capable of simultaneously closing both the head and groin.  The site of each clan offered its own generator of strikes and blocks.  Experienced Newbucks described the tactics of strikes and blocks.  For a certain amount of real or virtual money, they sold ‚Äúpractically win-win strategies‚Äù. <br>  But I'm a serious man.  Mathematician.  From the point of view of mathematics, everything is simpler - with a large number of strokes, the optimal distribution of the block and strike variants is optimal.  You need to throw a coin twice and make three mouse clicks.  And wait until the Internet slows down.  Waiting was the opposite.  Yes, and the work of the authorities piled.  It would be nice to have someone else press the buttons. <br>  And Larry Wall has already written a great thing - a word processor, that is, a Perl language compiler.  What is the html page?  This is a set of useful (player status and opponents) and useless (automatic chatter of the Main Flooder and non-automatic chatter of the others, which naturally took up the favorite activities of all the flooders - verbal hooliganism and the enticement of a few at first females).  On what, if not in Perl, is it easiest to separate the wheat from the chaff?  You just need to download the page, analyze it and download the next page. <br><br>  <em>Players A and B are isolated from each other and can</em> <em><br></em>  <em>exchange text messages.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>The goal of the game is to determine whether the opponent is a person or a machine.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>game "Test Turing"</em> <em><br></em> <br><br>  Unfortunately, smart young people who did not want to personally click the mouse in monotonous dialogues and wait for the response of forever thoughtful opponents turned out to be enough for the developers of the BC project to create their own Turing test, which the free email programs routinely use to prevent the attacker from automatically generating new email addresses.  Apparently, the first test, which consisted of four numbers unevenly located in the window, was not very reliable, and the developers changed the font of the numbers used on the envelopes, began not only to shift, but also to deform the letters and added noise.  I must say that they are great, because, for example, my program recognized only 94.7% of the pictures. <br><br>  <em>I know how to hurt</em> <em><br></em>  <em>I know how to kill</em> <em><br></em>  <em>I know what to show</em> <em><br></em>  <em>And what to conceal</em> <em><br></em>  <em>I know when to talk</em> <em><br></em>  <em>And I know when to touch</em> <em><br></em>  <em>No one ever died from wanting too much</em> <em><br></em>  <em>from the song of Garbage</em> <br><br>  After a week of trial and error code earned.  I did not have to think long over the floor of the first character.  Most of the players in the BC are men, and, naturally, they have a bad opinion about the mental abilities of the opposite sex, and after all, experience for victory is given equally.  So there was Snow White.  Carefully and accurately, she cut off mutants, players of a different level, or those who took more ups, for one hundredth of a second rejected attempts by Canis aureus to change clothes.  In cold blood, one by one, in physical battles, she destroyed the lovers of easy things, gaining maximum experience.  I think many will remember this lady with a necklace around her neck.  She also never slept or ate.  Snow White has bypassed a character with whom I played for three months ‚Äúmanually‚Äù in a week with a 2: 1 victory ratio. <br>  At first, I myself put changes in the stats of Snow White on the ups.  However, I quickly got tired of it, and I taught her to analyze the reasons for her losses.  Snow White compared his stats and the stats of the winner.  On the ups, she added exactly those stats, due to the lack of which she lost. <br><br>  <strong>WE PREVIOUSLY</strong> <br><br>  <em>My name is Legion</em> <em><br></em>  <em>title of the book R. Zelazny</em> <br><br>  <em>Violations associated with the institution of several characters.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>Registration of several characters by one person.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>Providing false information about characters logged in from one computer.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>Bleeding on "bots", i.e.</em>  <em>specially instituted characters.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>From the Laws of Fight Club</em> <br><br>  It's all about greed.  I wanted more beautiful trinkets.  Transferring directly large amounts of credits between the charms were punished.  And the check will not pass.  This is the sweet word Commission.  I came up with a scheme.  Char A bought product X at the real price and handed over to the commission at a fantastic price.  Char B was buying item X. And it was not necessary to wait for the fourth level.  Developer scripts have not seen this Scheme.  At least at the beginning.  Well, solve the equation, what is X?  Of course, amber necklace.  Only here you need a lot of bots. <br>  Of course, it is not difficult to establish a rule on the server - ‚Äúone IP - one character‚Äù.  But half the world plays through gateways with one external address.  So, developers need to look for another way to define "multi".  And this is great, because it gives a whole field of possibilities to deceive this method.  I took the names of the "owners" of bots from the telephone directory, but I myself gave the names to the characters.  Some of them were now male.  To be not so suspicious.  I was too lazy to write a script for the automatic implementation of the Scheme and manipulated the credits manually. <br><br>  <strong>DEFEAT</strong> <br><br>  <em>Small children - small problems.</em>  <em>Big children are big problems.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>proverb</em> <br><br>  Caring for the bots consisted in buying them spent amber necklaces.  The best thing was going on in SunCity - the most democratic city of BC, the city of fist fighters.  Invisible began to poison the life of Snow White at the sixth level.  The program did not provide for their existence and happily fought with invisibles, going for three or four hits per day in a wheelchair.  The software implementation of the marinade for jackals and invisibles did not fix the situation - after 10 minutes Snow White still got injured.  The case is up.  It was necessary to change something.  I hobbled it a month to the seventh level ‚Äúby hand‚Äù. <br>  The majority of successfully committed crimes are revealed because the criminal speaks about them around and does not bother about anything at all.  I hope you also love to read Dostoevsky.  And the truth - what's the point in the "Ferrari", if no one sees it?  The idea to boast that I have eight thousand credits burned me with an iron.  And soon there were people ready to buy credits.  So began hell.  Sooner or later they will catch me. <br><br>  <strong>AS EPILOGUE</strong> <br><br>  <em>Test purchase of the Order of Light.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>For illegal operations</em> <em><br></em>  <em>You will be sent to the unit ...</em> <br><br>  I slumped back.  The refrigerator has been empty for a couple of days.  A terrible headache.  I went out into the night frost and crunched to the round-the-clock tent.  In BC there are no sausages.  In general, all this is stupid ... <br>  ‚Ä¶ I go in for sports.  I‚Äôll finish my thesis soon.  I work as a programmer in a prestigious company.  Of course, I will not be able to recover from the disease with information technology, because I am chronicles, but I even have some free time. <br>  But sometimes, little by little, from my wife, I read the news feed of the ‚Äúmerck‚Äù and I envy a little of everything crazy.  Because the material is secondary. <br><br>  <em>This story was first published by me in 2005.</em> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/29016/">https://habr.com/ru/post/29016/</a></p>
