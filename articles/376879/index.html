  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Just5 Blaster: anti-crisis smartphone with not a budget filling</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> In our humble opinion, the typical middle-class device of 2015 should have at least a HD-screen, a 13 megapixel camera and an integrated LTE modem.  How much can such a model cost?  It would seem that less than 14-15 thousand something like this is not found.  However, Blaster was able to refute this quite logical assumption: this unit can be bought for only 11 thousand.  Will Blaster be able to become a real blaster in the hands of Just5 - such a blaster so that it can be used to destroy competitors once or twice?  Well, let's study and understand ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/962/1c0/4a9/9621c04a97dc494b9648fe003b51dbb8.JPG"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The history of Just5 began in 2009, when the first phone of this brand was launched: Just5 CP09.  Appearance of this device unambiguously hints that the brand was originally focused on the elderly.  CP09 implemented a whole range of functions for such users: SOS-button, large keys and fonts on them, loud speakers, and so on.  However, it soon became clear that Just5 phones were in demand not only from retirees: they were willingly taken by vacationers, tourists, gardeners, tablet owners who urgently needed a simple ‚Äúlong-playing‚Äù handset only for calls, and just fashionable youth ‚Äî hipsters, clubbers and others Comrades, tired of the "iPhones" and "Galaxies."  In this regard, in Just5, partially retaining the orientation on the elderly, made a nod to the users of other ages and released versions of their phones in bright colors.  So, Just5 CP09 was originally offered only in black, but then followed a number of more cheerful options, including bright orange and bright red. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/528/6d3/fdc/5286d3fdc20a428487d419dbc598100a.jpg"><br>  <font color="#999">Just5 CP09</font>

      Much later, in 2011, after the release of several new models, Just5 returned to the topic CP09 and developed a modification ‚ÄúFifteen.‚Äù  Admire: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8f0/38d/695/8f038d69571d4b60a5bcb770c20292fb.jpg"><br>  <font color="#999">Just5 CP09 Fifteen</font> <br><br>  The models of the Just5 CP10 family of the 2010 model were also initially only white and black, but in 2011, yellow, pink, orange, blue and purple versions appeared on the market.  The model with a multi-colored keyboard complemented the picture - it was called BestInSpace without false modesty.  An important feature of these phones was the case of the material, popularly known as "soft-touch".  Just5, perhaps one of the first in the world, used velvety plastic of several colors other than black in mobile phones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8fe/d9c/343/8fed9c3439a94d40b7f62dad72817a9a.jpg"><br>  <font color="#999">Just5 CP10</font> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a20/e4c/566/a20e4c566e4c4dd7a6d52fed2a0450f9.jpg"><br>  <font color="#999">Just5 CP10</font> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/640/332/1d3/6403321d3b534a3b885dc371f3b01bf6.jpg"><br>  <font color="#999">Just5 CP10 BestInSpace</font> <br><br>  Also in 2010, the Just5 CP11 was released - the first phone in the world with a ‚Äújumping out‚Äù display.  He looked like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a18/dda/5b6/a18dda5b6b394c419d9b5c467f31763d.jpg"><br>  <font color="#999">Just5 CP11</font> <br><br>  In 2013, the advanced phones of the CP10S series followed - with larger screens, completely different fonts and a number of new software options.  At the same time, the design has retained recognition, which is very important for such devices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1a7/85d/d43/1a785dd438204bb18b6c459c04eb0c68.jpg"><br>  <font color="#999">Just5 CP10S</font> <br><br>  Also in 2013, sales of the Brick model began (the ‚Äúbrick‚Äù) - a 90s style phone with a retractable antenna.  The design of this device was developed in Art. Lebedev Studio. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fc0/072/4e4/fc00724e422345b7b53c6d3b61f4963b.jpg"><br>  <font color="#999">Just5 Brick</font> <br><br>  Already at the end of 2013, another button model came out - Just5 Surf.  In it, the designers of the brand departed from the canons set by them earlier, but ... Let's just say this: it did not get any worse.  The model turned out to be noticeable and definitely has its own face. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/69a/cf5/3fd/69acf53fd5d84cbfbf3430902a00c476.jpg"><br>  <font color="#999">Just5 Surf</font> <br><br>  However, the main event for Just5 in 2013 was not the Surf and not even the Lebedev Brick, but the Spacer model.  What is special about it?  And here is what: in Just5, they suddenly decided to move away from the course on push-button phones that had been verified over the years and release ... a smartphone.  This same smartphone, Just5 Spacer, became the ‚Äúfirst‚Äù and ‚Äúmost‚Äù in several areas at once.  First, at the time of the start of sales, the model turned out to be the most affordable 5-inch ‚Äúsmart phone‚Äù on the market - its price was 4,950 rubles (recall that we are talking about the end of 2013!).  Secondly, Just5 Spacer became the first device in Russia on the MediaTek MT6582 chipset.  Now this hardware platform is known to almost everyone who has any serious interest in gadgets, but two years ago it caused genuine interest.  And it fully justified it: the device turned out to be very productive, especially for its price.  How did Just5 achieve this price / performance ratio?  It's very simple: thanks to direct sales through its own online store, that is, bypassing the ‚Äúcheating‚Äù of retail networks.  Russian Xiaomi?  You can say so - and not much sin against the truth.  As a result, Just5 Spacer cost 5 thousand rubles, and close analogues according to its characteristics at the end of 2013 were estimated at 7-8-9 thousand.  In Russia, Just5 Spacer, which is logical, enjoyed steady demand, and it is also known that this model <a href="http://www.baltic-course.com/rus/good_for_business/%3Fdoc%3D90453">managed to become</a> one of the best-selling smartphones in Latvia. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/165/b20/86f/165b2086ffa04b29a49888a6f77d2bc2.jpg"><br>  <font color="#999">Just5 Spacer</font> <br><br>  And now comes the 2015th year.  New "buttons" from Just5 on the horizon is not yet visible, although the brand does not intend to abandon this direction.  At the same time, a fresh brand smartphone is very much prepared - get acquainted, Just5 Blaster.  Let's immediately deal with pricing.  The model is estimated at 11 thousand rubles.  Yes, it is no longer 5 thousand, as is the case with the "Speiser", but do not forget about the dollar rate.  In fact, 5 thousand rubles of the sample of 2013 are equivalent to 11 thousand of the sample of 2015.  So, roughly speaking, the new smartphone Just5 is not at all more expensive than the previous one.  Moreover, Just5 Blaster is by far the most affordable middle-class smartphone. <br><br>  Specifications of Just5 Blaster and comparison with Just5 Spacer: <br><table><tbody><tr><td width="200"></td><td width="300">  <b>Just5 Blaster</b> </td><td width="300">  <b>Just5 Spacer</b> </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Screen</b> </td><td>  5 inches, 1280 x 720 points, capacitive, TFT-IPS + OGS, multitouch </td><td>  5 inches, 540 x 960 pixels, capacitive, TFT-IPS, multitouch </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Front camera</b> </td><td>  5 Mp </td><td>  2 Mp </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Main camera</b> </td><td>  13 megapixel (autofocus, flash) </td><td>  8 megapixel (autofocus, flash) </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Wi-Fi</b> </td><td>  + (802.11n) </td><td>  + (802.11n) </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>3G</b> </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>LTE</b> </td><td>  + (Cat. 4, up to 150 Mbps) </td><td>  - </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>GPS / GLONASS</b> </td><td>  + / + </td><td>  +/‚Äì </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Dual SIM</b> </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Chipset</b> </td><td>  <a href="http://www.mediatek.com/en/products/mobile-communications/smartphone1/mt67321/">MediaTek MT6732</a> , 1.5 GHz, 4 ARM Cortex-A53 cores (64 bits), Mali-T760MP2 graphics </td><td>  MediaTek MT6582M, 1.2 GHz, 4 ARM Cortex-A7 cores (32 bits), Mali-400MP2 graphics </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>RAM / ROM</b> </td><td>  2 GB / 16 GB </td><td>  1 GB / 4 GB </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Memory cards</b> </td><td>  microSDHC </td><td>  microSDHC </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>operating system</b> </td><td>  Android 4.4.4 KitKat </td><td>  Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Battery</b> </td><td>  2700 mAh </td><td>  1800 mAh </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Dimensions</b> </td><td>  145 x 72 x 9.5 mm </td><td>  144 x 71 x 9.4 mm </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Panels included</b> </td><td>  3 pieces: <br>  - dark gray <br>  - white <br>  - yellow <br>  + black bumper cover </td><td>  2 pieces: <br>  - dark gray <br>  - white </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Price in 2013</b> </td><td>  - </td><td>  4950 rubles </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Price in 2015</b> </td><td>  11 000 rubles </td><td>  5 850 rubles </td></tr></tbody></table><br><h2>  Packing and packaging </h2><br>  As mentioned above, the low price of Just5 Spacer, and now Just5 Blaster is largely due to direct sales through the company's online store, and not at all the savings on any components of smartphones.  The packaging in which the device is supplied confirms this version once more.  Yellow and gray cardboard, high print quality, located exactly on their ‚Äúseats‚Äù of stickers - in short, everything is at a high level. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f0d/fa9/d4e/f0dfa9d4ebfd4e08bd257150d214124c.JPG"><br><br>  Grade also pleased.  Even not so: rather not pleased, but surprised.  Because in the box there were three rear covers at once: white, dark gray and yellow.  (In Spacer, we recall, there were only two.) But that's not all: along with Just5 Blaster, a very decent quality black rubber bumper is supplied.  This is truly an anti-crisis proposal: in order to purchase a couple of extra rear panels and such a bumper to any other smartphone, you will need to pay 3-4 thousand rubles.  And here everything is included - take it and use it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/980/f62/5a4/980f625a426e45ba97887602a25df87e.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3f9/cf3/73f/3f9cf373f9954371b246a55fb03284f2.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e0c/deb/36c/e0cdeb36c6dd4121800461712abe9ac8.JPG"><br><br>  We list the rest of the components: short user manual, warranty card, a simple wired headset with headphones of the ‚Äúgag‚Äù type, a network charger unit and a USB cable.  The last three components are made of plastic and rubber of a noble white color.  Sheer trifle, it would seem, but generally inexpensive smartphones are usually equipped with much less pretty black accessories. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ec9/b90/d68/ec9b90d68ff4475da81cd3f07c80b8b2.JPG"><br><br><h2>  Appearance and usability </h2><br>  A smartphone is neither big nor small - a typical 5-inch device.  At the same time, Just5 Blaster is quite heavy: 185 grams.  On the one hand, this is a bit too much, but on the other hand, a too light smartphone in such a form factor would be felt in your hand as something cheap.  In the case of the model in question, there is no such problem; it seems to be a qualitative thing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6b6/c93/4a0/6b6c934a074243dcb4605e146f33b571.JPG"><br><br>  As already mentioned in the previous section, three interchangeable rear covers are included with the smartphone.  Yellow and white have a glossy finish, but the dark gray panel is matte.  All three are pleasant to the touch, although, of course, I would like to get at least one cover from a soft-touch.  (Its role, apparently, is played by the bumper.) Also note that we mercilessly exploited the Blaster for two weeks, and not one of the three covers was rubbed during this time.  Yes, micro-scratches appeared on glossy yellow and white, but they are almost not noticeable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cb8/875/c22/cb8875c22f314173b65bed8d335474ed.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/523/047/828/52304782825d470d8c346d3ad52689bd.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3e9/621/8eb/3e96218eb6ad4c5abb7231bb80bc00f6.JPG"><br><br>  The volume and on / off buttons for the screen are located on the right side of the case.  These keys are built into the back covers, so their color changes depending on the color of the installed backrest.  The buttons are generally comfortable - they have a clear move and quite sharp edges, which makes it easy to grope them with your finger.  But it didn‚Äôt go without a drawback: the distance between the keys is very small, just over two millimeters, so, trying to turn on the screen, you can accidentally touch the volume swing as well.  It happens quite often. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cd9/844/097/cd98440970f04ce5833363bf22bc4aa3.JPG"><br><br>  But to build quality no complaints.  All three panels sit as glued, and after two weeks of regular ‚Äúidiot shifts‚Äù (read - re-installing the lids), they did not become loose.  To remove the panels on the body there is a special recess under the nail. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/49e/599/a30/49e599a3047941a6bfe547fd31421592.JPG"><br><br>  Here, on the top, there was a place for a 3.5 mm headphone jack. <br><br>  On the bottom is a microphone and a microUSB port for connecting to a computer and a charger.  The correct location: if you had this connector on top, like some inexpensive smartphones - and it would not be very convenient for the device to talk to the connected charging: the cable would interfere.  But Just5 Blaster does not have this drawback. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/12e/8af/fa8/12e8affa899d4d859bc1095a63c998be.JPG"><br><br>  Above the screen - a standard set of elements: a voice speaker, front camera (5 megapixels), light sensors and proximity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/012/9c8/14b/0129c814b6714dbcb41984d08317a18a.JPG"><br><br>  Below the display are three touch-sensitive buttons: ‚Äúcall the context menu‚Äù, ‚Äúhome‚Äù and ‚Äúback‚Äù.  The two extremes have pictograms in the form of very dimly lit points, the central one is marked with a circle with bright blue backlighting.  He, by the way, acts as a LED indicator - informs about new letters, lichkakh, missed calls, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/201/da7/f13/201da7f135e442e79eaa25f868354533.JPG"><br><br>  On the back panel there are holes for the lens of the main 13-megapixel camera, LED flash, as well as the multimedia speaker. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/444/24c/eba/44424ceba62e4b7bafc1644745449841.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dec/855/750/dec8557507bb4fd2a748d60e5ebad688.JPG"><br><br>  We remove the back cover and see the slots for two MicroSIM-formatted SIM-cards, as well as a slot for a MicroSD-format card.  Pay special attention to the yellow removable battery with Just5 logo.  This is the whole essence of the brand: when others would save a couple of cents and put a standard black battery, the ‚Äúauthors‚Äù of Blaster put money into beauty. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e95/01c/879/e9501c87953943f4b39a8afea566d3cd.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9da/902/a42/9da902a425bc4ac39722f57bd8ca8801.JPG"><br><br><h2>  Screen </h2><br>  In Just5 Blaster uses a 5-inch screen with a resolution of 1280 x 720, which gives a pixel density of 294 ppi.  The matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãmade by IPS technology, and a good quality.  The viewing angles are wide - about 170 degrees in the eye, which is vertically and horizontally.  Purple and orange peculiar to low-cost IPS-displays, not seen.  The only thing you can find fault with is the care of shades in cold tones.  That is, the white color does not seem to be completely white, but rather, light blue.  However, this moment practically does not affect the perception of the image - it is clear, bright and pleasant to the eye.  We also note that the Just5 Blaster display uses the One Glass Solution (OGS) technology, that is, the LCD matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãcombined with the sensor layer and protective glass into one ‚Äúsandwich‚Äù.  This further enhances the quality of the image - as if it lies on the surface of the front panel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1f3/f75/8bd/1f3f758bd7744422b418e81903a2fa29.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ae3/8fe/c5f/ae38fec5f78a4585a16fbfbdb2417c37.JPG"><br><br>  In the tincture of the display is found a curious item - MiraVision.  This is a proprietary technology from MediaTek, the chipset developer on which Just5 Blaster is based.  MiraVision increases the clarity of the image when displaying various multimedia content on the screen.  This is achieved by adjusting the intensity of the backlight of the display depending on the brightness of the surrounding space and the color gamut of the content displayed on the display.  This saves the battery charge of the device, plus the user's vision is less tired when watching movies or 3D gaming for a long time.  For example, if the room is dark, then MiraVision technology will automatically reduce the backlight intensity.  The light will hit less in the eye, and the entertainment of the game will not suffer from this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/081/83c/dea/08183cdeab9e4f0abe55274c1573e1b5.png"><br><br>  However, MiraVision offers a set of tools to adjust the screen settings - sharpness, color temperature, and so on.  All this is available in the "user" mode, while there are two options with fixed settings: "standard" and "bright." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/abc/8cd/1a3/abc8cd1a3dd54909a9023beacb0a9886.png"><br><br>  The display of Just5 Blaster is covered with glass, though it‚Äôs not Gorilla Glass and Dragon Trail, but something nameless.  However, glass copes with its tasks: the finger slides along it easily, plus there is a tolerable quality oleophobic coating on the screen surface.  The sensor layer is made by capacitive technology, it supports up to 5 simultaneous clicks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c50/901/a1f/c50901a1fcc44f2582c0472f73d67684.png"><br><br><h2>  Sound </h2><br>  The multimedia speaker located on the rear panel provides the average quality of music playback, but it is very loud.  Do not miss the call.  You can listen to the music in the company with the help of Just5 Blaster, but it will not replace any wired or wireless speaker.  Pre-installed ringtones sound quite acceptable, although in order to achieve maximum quality and volume, it is worth playing with various MP3 files.  This way you can achieve a better result. <br><br>  Complete headphones of stars from the sky are not enough, and for the pleasure of listening to music, it is better to replace them with something more perfect.  In the music player, quite standard for the Android OS, an equalizer is provided. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/798/608/167/798608167bf245439781bbfa17861736.png"><br><br>  In the sound settings, several "improvers" are detected.  It‚Äôs impossible to say that thanks to them the smartphone starts to ‚Äúsing‚Äù many times better - just the sound becomes slightly different.  Experimenting with these checkboxes is worth it - it may be that after that the particular user will really like the sound more. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1da/ebe/fb0/1daebefb09b342ca89629aaba20cb16a.png"><br><br>  As for the quality of voice transmission, there‚Äôs nothing particularly to talk about: the vast majority of modern smartphones have a standard-high level, and Just5 Blaster is no exception.  Yes, there are no tricky noise canceling systems with multiple microphones in the model, but this is absolutely normal for devices of this class. <br><br>  The application for listening to FM-radio stations does not stand out for anything special, except that it generally is.  And in recent years, this reasonably useful option has somehow disappeared from many flagship smartphones - for example, Samsung Galaxy S4 and S5.  And in Just5 Spacer, radio is not only that, but it also allows you to record the broadcast.  As is usually the case, listening to the stations requires connecting headphones ‚Äî they play the role of an antenna. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/11f/e82/358/11fe823580f648568b123a9b47c1e323.png"><br><br><h2>  Cameras </h2><br>  On the one hand, 13 megapixels from Japanese Sony is serious, and from such a camera one can well expect acceptable image quality.  Actually, this is - acceptable - the quality of the camera Just5 Blaster provides.  You should not demand too much from her: she will capture any landscape or a kitten in good light without problems, playfully cope with the text.  But to photograph any flower in absolutely all the details, let alone any scene in the dark in low light with this smartphone, alas, will not work. <br><br>  By default, the camera takes pictures with a resolution of 13 megapixels (4160 x 3120), the pictures in this case have a 4: 3 aspect ratio.  You can also choose other options: 12, 9.5, 8, 6, 5, 4, 3 and 2 megapixels, and in the latter case, 4: 3 and 16: 9 formats are offered. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a1b/236/797/a1b236797fe1407e86de13b20d7d01b6.png"><br><br>  Examples of images: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/21b/dd2/489/21bdd2489d12414f88c898c668b9df57.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ae8/cfa/9ca/ae8cfa9ca9ee4eb39c8217b62eab73d3.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/173/43e/c3b/17343ec3b44f44c2a4bfa39ff6a6565d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/39d/800/932/39d8009323d44ab09f754b4107bcca48.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4ef/ec5/857/4efec58575c34af18e2feee0aa2982ec.jpg"><br><br>  Video Just5 Blaster records in maximum resolution Full HD 1080p.  With its quality, everything is about the same as with the photo: tolerant, but I would like more. <br><br>  As for the front camera, then it has a resolution of 5 megapixels - just in accordance with the fashion on the selfie.  Again: in good light, the smartphone in question produces quite decent photos, but once the light fades, the quality also decreases proportionally.  By the way, a curious fact: the front camera of the Blaster with autofocus - this option is found in the front-facing smartphones not so often. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a65/413/564/a654135649844b4384f49fe4fa6b7151.png"><br><br>  The camera interface is typical of most devices on MediaTek chipsets.  The set of options available to the user can be seen in the screenshots.  From myself, we add that we have no complaints about the convenience of the interface - it is quite convenient to use it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/687/a86/fc0/687a86fc0e5b493e89a840691fb3f70a.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/803/f68/06d/803f6806db0f483daee752939899375d.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/98b/c9e/dfc/98bc9edfce4c4175b7841a2b92416e1b.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/82c/d39/07d/82cd3907d1bf43bb9e4fd4240a13c650.png"><br><br><h2>  Telephone and communications </h2><br>  Everything is very interesting here.  Let's start with the main point: Just5 Blaster supports fourth generation LTE cellular networks (Cat. 4, up to 150 Mbps).  Moreover, it can work with two SIM cards.  Usually in smartphones priced at up to 12 thousand rubles, either the first option or the second option is found.  In the "Blaster", both are implemented - and similar devices, that is, "inexpensive dvuhsimochniki with LTE", while you can count on your fingers.  One.  So let's assume that this is the highlight of Just5 Spacer - and not least.  In order to immediately close the LTE theme, we note that everything works like a clock - in the ‚Äúfourth generation‚Äù the device feels great. <br><br>  But we will tell about two SIM-cards in more detail, for there is something.  Both MicroSIM sim cards have the same priority: any of the cards can work on 2G, 3G and 4G networks.  Previously, as it was: one slot in smartphones was intended exclusively for 2G networks, and the second - for 2G, and for 3G.  Now this unpleasant face is erased.  True, the radio module in Just5 Blaster is one, so when talking to one SIM card, the second one will traditionally be disconnected from the network. <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the settings of SIM-cards you can set a color for each of them, set priorities and so on. Everything here is standard for Android, and we found nothing special. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d26/116/6e8/d261166e800f435cbb599707fd47086a.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Applications related to the communication part of the smartphone are absolutely standard. That is, for messages and calls, programs from the "pure" Android are used. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b6a/24b/b72/b6a24bb72e8a4b4d8d58844578403fdb.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Wi-Fi module (802.11b / g / n) supports dual-band operation ‚Äî 2.4 and 5 GHz, and we also note support for Wi-Fi Direct. There are no complaints about the stability and quality of reception. As for Bluetooth, version 4.0 LE is supported. In other words, fitness bracelets, smart watches and other wearable electronics will function in conjunction with the "Blaster" without problems.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As for navigation capabilities, Just5 Blaster works with both the American GPS navigation system and the Russian GLONASS. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">True, the satellites smartphone is looking for a leisurely - even if you allow him to navigate, including the base stations. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On the other hand, if the Blaster finds satellites, it does not lose in the process of navigation.</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7cc/357/eb2/7cc357eb25b942bd8b401297ea12e753.png"><br><br><h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> OS and software </font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Just5 Blaster runs on the latest iteration of Android 4.4 KitKat - 4.4.4. The operating system is presented almost in its original form, except for MediaTek's MiraVision technology, which we have already described in the subsection on the screen. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/631/695/991/631695991b4544c1838485ba0dbef847.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the interface, the developers did not change anything - everything is standard: </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5ab/855/19c/5ab85519c6654619a30e3fd72710c587.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4d9/d4d/d42/4d9d4dd423b843c3838ec81641224b74.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of the additional applications, we note the backup utility, the voice recorder, a fairly convenient file manager and a simple video editor. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ac5/ba5/77e/ac5ba577edd44e9694f8e2cc08bc30b4.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/003/17e/eda/00317eedaad240369eba668a1dbfc93a.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We were pleased with the ‚ÄúSmart Wake-up‚Äù function: thanks to it, on a screen off, you can draw a letter, after which the display turns on and this or that application starts. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/df3/434/d59/df3434d59b2145d1a8c21fe03796c423.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">From Just5, the smartphone got a set of branded wallpapers:</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/121/f23/a7f/121f23a7f6e54c0ca4f5abafccf5456f.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And finally, we single out the main software flaw in Just5 Blaster: it does not implement firmware updates over the air. So if any update is released for the device, then it will have to be installed using a cable and a computer.</font></font><br><br><h2>  Performance </h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If Just5 Spacer was the first smartphone on the MediaTek MT6582 chipset in Russia, then Just5 Blaster is the first MediaTek MT6732 based chipset. This hardware platform is designed for middle-class smartphones - in fact, it is the successor of MT6582, and taking into account the realities of 2015. Firstly, the MediaTek MT6732 includes an integrated LTE modem, a GLONASS / GPS receiver, a Bluetooth module with support for Low Energy mode, and a dual-band Wi-Fi adapter ‚Äî we have already mentioned this above. But let's add a few words here as well: this set, in fact, makes the specified chipset modern and highly relevant. There was no LTE modem in the MT6582, and the rest of the listed technologies were implemented in the outdated versions today. Secondly, the processor in the MT6732 is 64-bit: it uses four ARM Cortex-A53 cores (roughly speaking,these are the ‚Äúideological heirs‚Äù of 32-bit ARM Cortex-A7) with a frequency of up to 1.5 GHz. Of course, we know that the notorious - and very trendy in our time - ‚Äú64-bit‚Äù is necessary primarily to equip smartphones with 4 GB of RAM, whereas in the ‚ÄúBlaster‚Äù only 2 GB of RAM. Nevertheless, the manufacturability of the chipset warms the soul - it collected all the best that one could afford when developing a ‚Äúsystem on a chip‚Äù for inexpensive smartphones. It remains to add that the Mali-T760 accelerator with a frequency of up to 500 MHz is responsible for processing graphics in MT6732, and proceed to testing.Nevertheless, the manufacturability of the chipset warms the soul - it collected all the best that one could afford when developing a ‚Äúsystem on a chip‚Äù for inexpensive smartphones.

In the last title, you could choose the maximum graphics settings, which we actually did. It should be emphasized that no hints on the brakes in any of these games have been recorded. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9e2/bd5/054/9e2bd505425343d2857acedd8e2ea139.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cdd/2d1/108/cdd2d11080bc437ca0795b2f4bacbca0.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Results in benchmarks. About 32 thousand points in AnTuTu - more than a decent result. I remember that the Spacer of the sample of the end of 2013 gained two times less - about 16 thousand. So the new product is actually twice as productive as its ‚Äúancestor‚Äù. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bdc/a70/db7/bdca70db733147d493501a625fc8cb6b.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/431/6e7/c30/4316e7c3070a4338a98f5647adb91886.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The internal memory in Just5 Blaster 16 GB, for multimedia content and installation of applications is available about 12.4 GB. The microSD card can reach 64 GB.</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a58/bf4/99c/a58bf499c5d34f55a3cfae8c82a104f1.png"><br><br><h2>  Autonomous work </h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Just5 Blaster is equipped with a lithium-polymer battery with a capacity of 2,700 mAh, which, coupled with a 28-nanometer chipset and a set of energy-saving technologies (recall MediaTek's MiraVision), gives hope for a very serious battery life. So it is: in the conditions of the LTE-network, the smartphone works full days, plus until the evening of the second day. True, in order to achieve such a result, you will have to abandon games and TV shows in the subway. If we talk about working until full discharge in specific modes, then the situation is as follows: </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- watching a video in HD720p - about 8 hours and 15 minutes; </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- reading an e-book - about 11 hours and 20 minutes; </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- 3D games - about 5 hours and 40 minutes.</font></font><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/eJCs6xS_p6U%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjm3zrZKnBUDSQwdRmsR18EEnS0Mg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We state the fact: Just5 again turned out a potential hit. If this device cost 15-16 thousand rubles, then, of course, it would be possible to find fault with the quality of shooting and, for example, the lack of updates over the air. But the fact is that it will cost 11 thousand rubles (the start of sales is scheduled for the second quarter of 2015). And because of this is the best option in its class. A powerful chipset from MediaTek, LTE support, quite a high-quality screen, a non-weak battery and a really wide package - all of this is integrated in the Blaster. Yes, the device is not the most charismatic. But also it will cost, we repeat, there will be ridiculous money. So, it is very possible to recommend this smartphone for purchase - pay attention to it, even if the amount of your budget reaches 15-16-17 thousand. Very possiblythat when comparing any device for such an amount with the Blaster, the last one will be the best option.</font></font></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/376879/">https://habr.com/ru/post/376879/</a></p>
