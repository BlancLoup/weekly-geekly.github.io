      If someone does not know, this autumn Turkey was reopened again, and I could not resist and did not go on a last minute trip until the weather was good.  However, unpleasant news was waiting for me even at the airport: all operators significantly raised roaming tariffs, as they say - but I did not know.  Tele2 offers more profitable incoming calls, and everything else, in my opinion, is a complete nightmare! <br><br>  Well, I think, IP-telephony to help me ... but upon arrival, the guide pleased me once again, explaining that impoverished Turkish hotels mostly cut down Wi-Fi for their visitors.  Fortunately, at my hotel, Wi-Fi was still there, but it turned out to be so slow and stupid that I had to look for alternative ways to talk on the phone.  The problem is that the conversations were about work, and I was not going to tell someone that I flew to Turkey. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c21/a9b/c0d/c21a9bc0d0baaa946aea3fbb3f041cbd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  So, the disposition: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ 3G is, but very expensive ... fabulously expensive <br>  ‚Ä¢ Buying a local SIM is also very expensive - $ 30 bucks, then throw it away <br>  ‚Ä¢ There is simply no stable Wi-Fi network. <br>  ‚Ä¢ A call through a SIP service from a mobile device requires the installation and normal operation of the application, but there was no such thing - and nothing can be downloaded using such Wi-Fi <br>  ‚Ä¢ And even if I could call, there was no certainty that the quality of communication would not deteriorate in the next moment in time <br>  ‚Ä¢ I have long thought where to attach my bitcoins. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ac1/355/cae/ac1355caeea29a1915e58b33ff2842ca.png" alt="image"><br>  <b><a href="https://callcoinbot.com/">Callcoin</a></b> <br><br>  Googling a little on that terrible Wi-Fi, I found an alternative to the standard methods of conversation.  She turned out to be Callcoin - this is a Telegram bot that you can control in chat mode.  To make a call, simply connect the @callcoinbot bot and register by entering your phone number - right after that you can order calls directly in the chat.  Each new user is provided with a small balance for making 1-2 calls to test the system.  I tested, I was pleased. <br>  As it turned out, the Callcoin chatbot itself is written in PHP, which helps the user to access the communication service of the Latvian provider SanCom.  Each Callcoin user has a Latvian number at his disposal, which will be used for incoming calls, and will also be determined by default for outgoing calls. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b37/31e/c53/b3731ec5316708ea1f5714c64b839390.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  An outgoing call is made according to the Call-Back scheme: you dial the desired phone number in Telegram (manually or from the address book) and receive an incoming call from the system, and then you are connected to the subscriber.  The peculiarity of Callcoin is that you pay only for the tariff of connection with the subscriber, but at the same time you do not have to pay an additional callback. <br>  By the way, a cool feature - incoming calls from the territory of the European Union are also extremely simple: your friends, colleagues or acquaintances can dial the Latvian number provided by the system, and you will pay only minimal Callcoin tariffs per minute, while the euro will be used for the caller -rate. <br><br>  <b>Payment</b> <br><br>  But now the most interesting thing is that BitCoin was chosen for payment.  As a result, you can pay for a connection from any wallet from any country ‚Äî by converting ordinary money into a crypt or using existing crypto savings.  I just had a little bit, and it really helped. <br><br>  Further, as it turned out, you can transfer money in the system between users using special codes.  This allows you to buy a large number of minutes at a discount, and then resell them - a good income for those who have a lot of BitCoin, but have no idea where to put them. <br><br>  <b>Telegram Phone</b> <br><br>  Thanks to the emergence of <a href="https://callcoinbot.com/">Callcoin</a> , any Telegram user can make cheap calls without using IP telephony, but at the same low rates.  Thanks to the use of an intermediate software platform and chat bot, the client does not need to enter into a direct relationship with the telecom operator - he can simply call for his cryptodengi at any time and not report to anyone.  I think a very elegant solution ... <br><br>  <b>PS</b> When I studied this topic, I found out that in 2016 the ‚Äúvisa‚Äù for calls crossing the EU border went up in price significantly: now calling by ordinary phone to Russia and from Russia has become up to 10 times more expensive.  And the emergence of such a service as Callcoin makes it possible to have a favorable connection between Russia and the European Union (and in two directions), even when you do not have a reliable Internet, but only a GSM network.  Plus, if someone needs this information on the trip! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/314182/">https://habr.com/ru/post/314182/</a></p>
