  <section class="page js-page"><h1>CodeIgniter is more beautiful thanks to Bonfire</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  What am I talking about ... </h4><br>  Yes, indeed, everyone has probably already forgotten (and someone may not have remembered) what CodeIgniter is and has not been considered for a long time as a full-fledged framework.  Everything is pretty simple in it: controllers, models, mappings - and in every MVC element there is almost ‚Äúpure PHP‚Äù.  No migrations to you, modules, environments and other amenities for convenient work. <br><br>  I myself am a young programmer, I have only been programming for php for a year, and from that time I worked pretty much with this framework.  But in fact, it is very good for a general idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe MVC architecture and for beginners, in my opinion, simply not replaceable.  I dare say that I also work on YII and Symfony, and in fact it would be impossible for me from them to start surfing the possibilities of PHP frameworks. <br><br>  Studying more and more php and technologies in which it is convenient to develop web applications, I moved further and further (yes, just a year of ‚Äúservice‚Äù) away from CI and admired the beauty and ergonomic use of Symfony.  But here recently I came across Bonfire - a <b>powerful addition to CodeIgniter</b> . <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  Bonfire - Phoenix for CodeIgniter </h4><br>  Who has been working for CI for a long time, knows its fading popularity and uses many add-ons that extend the creative scope of the framework.  Or they gradually move to the <s>‚Äúsmaller‚Äù</s> brothers, which is quite predictable.  After acquaintance with Bonfire, namely with the <a href="http://cibonfire.com/blog/07_is_finally_live">final version 0.7</a> , which was released at the end of October of this year, I again wanted to return to development on CodeIgniter, and finish on it what I started earlier - this is pseudo-CMS.  That is something between the CMS and CMF, for the forced creation of simple sites based on modules.  And just, Bonfire helps me in this regard. <br><br><h4>  Why is it worth talking about? </h4><br>  Well, it‚Äôs not worth talking about the relevance of fast loading sites.  To do this, you can read the recommendations of Larry Page on optimization.  It is at Bonfire that the benefits are huge compared to the ‚Äúraw‚Äù CodeIgniter, and the advantages can be attributed to the fact that in some places it is more difficult to organize on other platforms.  Of course, I don‚Äôt speak about impossibility, as long as I am affected by the facts of ergonomic development.  Very briefly make a review.  Perhaps we will begin.  <i>(rub my palms)</i> <br><br>  <b>Developer Web Interface</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5b1/601/57a/5b160157a77f2fa6b32a746130ce151b.png" alt="Bonfire"><br><br>  Of course, in the field of php-industry is not new, and there are analogues for each framework, for example GII from Yii and SymfonySMF (I can be mistaken here with examples, the gurus will correct me).  I was very pleased that through the web interface there is the possibility of creating / editing modules, contexts (roughly speaking, in Bonfire, this is the category of modules), managing users, migrations and much more. <br><br>  <b>All the best from leading frameworks</b> <br><br>  I liked it very much that now the HMVC structure can be used more flexibly, which is characterized by the disconnection of the modules from each other.  Of course, the HMVC architecture in CodeIgniter was also with the Modular Extensions extension - HMVC 5, but still it became more convenient in combination with the use of layouts &amp; themes, which can also be used more than once.  The use of migrations also greatly influenced my impression.  Convenient work with assets (assets), c environments and even there is testing. <br><br><h4>  Cons, where do without them </h4><br>  Yes, without them nowhere.  The main disadvantage is that the project is a little damp and sometimes bugs fly out.  But so far I have not encountered the problem that I could not fix, since everything is done on a simple CodeIgniter.  Also, the disadvantages include the lack of "Russian language" for the project.  Although for me, for example, on the contrary, this is a plus, in parallel I study English.  Ideally, I would like a good community and Russian documentation.  Damn, and with all the minuses ... <br><br><h4>  Total </h4><br>  The article was impressed, and therefore does not cover very many points, both positive and negative.  If you suddenly need a detailed review, it is ready to bring overwork.  Thanks for attention. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/205492/">https://habr.com/ru/post/205492/</a></p>
