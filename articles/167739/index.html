  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Microsoft textbooks Microsoft SkillPipe for students and trainers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Just want to say that this post is addressed primarily to those who have studied, are studying or will be studying at official Microsoft courses, as well as Microsoft coaches. <br><br>  Last year, Microsoft courses began to be conducted with e-books, although it can be used and printed materials.  It would be about electronic textbooks that I would like to tell you in more detail - what opportunities they open up for students and trainers. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  SkillPipe for listeners </h4><br>  The use of the textbook begins with registration on the site skillpipe.courseware-marketplace.com.  Registration on the site is free and everyone can register.  The registration process is quite standard and comes down to two steps: the first is to enter a postal address, name, password;  the second is email confirmation.

          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

    <img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/25563714/pic/s1.jpg" alt="image"><br>  After authorization on the site you need to add textbooks.  To do this, enter a unique code issued by the training center on the course.  After entering the code, you can immediately start reading the book directly on the site. <br><br><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/25563714/pic/s2.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Main features of the book: <br><ul><li>  Search </li><li>  Jump by content </li><li>  Change display options </li><li>  Ability to print </li><li>  Insert comments and notes </li></ul><br>  It is a standard set for any e-book.  However, I would like to separately note the possibility of comments.  The students of the group have the opportunity to see the comments of each other and the coach.  Of course, the listener himself decides which comment should be made publicly available. <br><br>  If using the browser is not very convenient for you, you can download and install the SkillPipe application.  Link to the program is available on the login page.  After installation, you also need to log in, but in the program.  It is possible to register the device.  Registration allows you to use the SkillPipe program offline.  You can register up to three devices at the same time and cancel registration from the device at any time.  In the application, you can immediately read books without downloading them, or you can download them for offline viewing. <br><br><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/25563714/pic/s3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  SkillPipe for trainers </h4><br>  For trainers, Microsoft gives you the opportunity to get one free copy of a SkillPipe booklet.  To do this, each coach is granted access to the website shop.courseware-marketplace.com.  If it is not - you can contact the regional center Microsoft. <br><br>  By logging in, the trainer can ‚Äúbuy‚Äù electronic versions of books for SkillPipe at the price of 0 rubles.  After the ‚Äúpurchase‚Äù, the electronic code of the book comes to the mail, which can be used to activate it on the site skillpipe.courseware-marketplace.com.  For authorization, it is better to use the same login and password as for shop.courseware-marketplace.com. <br>  In order for the students' textbooks to be always available during the course, even if there is a problem with the Internet, you must ask the students to use the SkillPipe application and register the device.  Of course, at the end of the course, invite students to deregister the device. <br><br>  Each student can download the tutorial in the application independently, or you can use the opportunity to import books.  On the website management.courseware-marketplace.com, the coach can download the tutorial file in .bdb format.  Only those books that were ordered on <a href="http://shop.courseware-marketplace.com/">shop.courseware-marketplace.com</a> will be available. <br><br>  Next, students in the application must click the ImportBook button and select the file downloaded by the coach.  However, if the code for this tutorial has not been entered, then the book is not displayed.  You can first import the file and then enter the code for the tutorial, or in reverse order. <br><br>  The training center, ordering books for a new group, combines them into classes.  Thus, the comments of the listeners are visible to each other.  In order for the students to see the coach‚Äôs comments, an employee of the training center needs to specify a coach on the <a href="https://management.courseware-marketplace.com/en-GB">management.courseware-marketplace.com</a> website.  This happens by specifying the e-mail address that the coach uses to access the site. <br><br>  The ability to see comments is convenient to use to correct errors in the textbook.  The coach once notes in his SkillPipe inaccuracy, for example, an error in the steps of the laboratory, and then all groups of students see these corrections. <br><br><h4>  Instead of conclusion </h4><br>  SkillPipe is far from an ideal e-reader.  There is no support for mobile platforms, a very complicated book registration system, sometimes an inaccessible website.  However, it is still better than thick paper books that the training center was difficult to deliver, and listeners to carry and search for information in them.  Let's see what happens with the SkillPipe further. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/167739/">https://habr.com/ru/post/167739/</a></p>
