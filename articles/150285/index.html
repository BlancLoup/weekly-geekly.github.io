  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Nekki internship program</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The idea to launch an internship project in Nekki appeared in the spring of 2012.  We experienced difficulties with the selection of motivated and responsible personnel, and therefore decided to try to create the conditions for productive selection and training. <br><br>  Over the summer, we received more than 1,000 applications and 15 people passed our internship.  This turned out to be a very interesting and successful experiment, the details of which we will share with the readers of Habra. <br><br><img src="http://nekki.ru/images/habr/talents/1.jpg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  <i>‚ÄúIn the mind of a beginner there are many possibilities, in the mind of an expert there are only a few.‚Äù</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Shunru Suzuki</i> </h4><br>  The main value of our company is enthusiasm (this is how the name Nekki translates from Japanese), and we consider this quality to be the key to success.  However, many people who came to us for jobs, at interviews looked burned out.  Having worked in different companies, they lost their motivation and enthusiasm.  As a rule, such people value their experience highly, but they are not eager to learn new things.  This is especially critical in the IT industry, where a new one appears every day, and over the years and even months the market may change beyond recognition. <br><br>  The first thing we did to reach out to enthusiasts and dreamers was to create an inspiring website about our internship program: <a href="http://talents.nekki.ru/">talents.nekki.ru</a> <br><br><img src="http://nekki.ru/images/habr/talents/2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But, of course, only one enthusiasm is not enough.  There are many enthusiasts who easily catch fire with a new idea, but throw it away without finishing it.  Therefore, the second necessary quality is composure, responsibility. <br><br>  People with this quality have been brought up since childhood in such a way that they strive to do any work well.  We already wrote about this in a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/Nekki/blog/142459">recent article</a> on Habr√©, and we are looking for just such people in the first place. <br><br>  We suggested that applicants fill out a fairly large questionnaire.  According to how thoroughly and accurately the answers were filled, it was possible to assess the composure and purposefulness of the person. <br><br>  In addition to standard questions, in this questionnaire we asked to tell about hobbies and interests.  As we thought, those who responsibly responded to filling out the questionnaire turned out to be versatile, enthusiastic, and competently writing.  No wonder they say, "a talented person is talented in everything." <br><br>  To search for candidates, we tried various sources: participation in exhibitions, work in communities, advertising among the audience of our projects, interaction with universities.  However, the most effective method turned out to be contextual advertising on Vkontakte, aimed at the right audience (city, age, hobbies). <br><br>  So the applications sent were divided by education: <br><img src="http://nekki.ru/images/habr/talents/3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Of the more than 1,000 applications we sent, we selected the most interesting ones, and almost all of the candidates invited to the office fully met our expectations, and even exceeded them. <br><br>  As a result, we took 15 people for internship (although initially we planned to take 10) and all new applications continue to come to us.  Here are the main areas that candidates choose: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6f1/4a3/d95/6f14a3d9557b438a24a08e6f25244814.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We recruited several people in the directions of game design, graphics, project management, community management and marketing. <br><br>  Each trainee was assigned a workplace in the office and a personal tutor was appointed who is constantly nearby and helps with work issues. <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúContrary to initial expectations, interns from the first days began to provide real assistance in their work.</i>  <i>The enthusiasm with which they attacked the tasks of the Colonialists project more than compensated for the lack of experience.</i>  <i>As a result, each of them became an important member of the development team. ‚Äù</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Shamil Magomedov, Project Manager</i> <br><br>  Separately, it is worth emphasizing that our goal was to immediately give interns ‚Äúcombat‚Äù tasks, involving them in real work under the guidance of a mentor.  For example, many of the interns have already been able to participate in the work on the game "Vector", developed in parallel for social networks and mobile platforms. <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúDuring the internship, I worked on the new game‚Äú Vector ‚Äù.</i>  <i>He was mainly engaged in the design of the levels of the new location ‚ÄúConstruction yard‚Äù.</i>  <i>During the internship I made several tracks, which eventually ended up in the release and now you can see them in the application on Facebook.</i>  <i>And of course, the most pleasant result was the job offer at Nekki, which I gladly accepted. ‚Äù</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Andrei Revenko, intern in the game design department</i> <br><br><img src="http://nekki.ru/images/habr/talents/5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Our <a href="http://nekki.ru/talents">internship program</a> continues; three interns have already received regular paid employment.  We hope that this experience will be useful, and other companies will follow our example, giving the opportunity to young talents to express themselves. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/150285/">https://habr.com/ru/post/150285/</a></p>
