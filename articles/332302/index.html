But events develop so rapidly that literally in three weeks a number of projects that were discussed earlier by me here on Habr√©, as well as on other resources, have already been adopted in the first reading: the most prominent of them are the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/330552/">‚Äúlaw‚Äù on VPN</a> and a <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/329426/">project of the same about messengers</a> . <br><br>  Most surprisingly, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Federal Service for Health and Social Affairs, and, most importantly, the Federal Tax Service have already adopted <a href="http://publication.pravo.gov.ru/Document/GetFile/0001201706290015%3Ftype%3Dpdf">an order</a> to block the VPN (and it looks even better than <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/330458/">the Roskomnadzor white list</a> ).  And this is despite the fact that three readings and the signature of the President (and yes - even entry into force) have not been canceled.  There is already a <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/290711/">discussion</a> on Gigtime.

      It should be noted that this is happening against the background of this law, which has already been <a href="http://kremlin.ru/acts/news/54928">signed</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  According to the law, the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media of Russia takes a <i>reasoned decision to recognize the site as a copy of the blocked site and sends this decision to the owner of the site and to Roskomnadzor to take measures to restrict access to the copy of the blocked site, which will be carried out out of court</i> </blockquote><br>  That is, blocking Internet resources across all vectors - are these the most important unsolved problems (probably quotes are needed?) In the largest country in the world by area? <br><br>  Few people paid attention lately, but in fact exactly from the same opera, or call it what you want, so-called.  <a href="https://rkn.gov.ru/news/rsoc/news47174.htm">online cinema</a> law.  After all: <br><br><ol><li>  Online cinemas must be registered ... in the RKN </li><li>  For violation of the requirements of the ILV - they can cover </li><li>  Terrorism is evil, you don‚Äôt need to show it </li></ol><br>  And yes, control over all and everything - now not only through <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/329154/">online cash exchanges</a> , but also online in general.  And cash desks - from 01.07.17 took over their possession.  True, 1/3 in general has learned about this innovation and nothing more: it is still <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DWc31_HNsg0U">difficult to</a> purchase a ticket office, but the Federal Tax Service only does what it writes. <br><br>  In this regard, I personally find it very strange to read that the ‚Äúfirst‚Äù law on cryptocurrency will be adopted in Russia (and then also on ICO, mining, etc.).  It is also strange because supposedly <a href="http://rt.rbc.ru/tatarstan/03/07/2017/5959ec8f9a79473ef05e12f4">there will be no taxes for this sphere</a> on the project.  Maybe.  At the beginning.  Not for long.  After identifying all possible schemes - will taxes be introduced with double force, as was the case with <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/298634/">electronic money</a> , <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/326102/">e-commerce</a> and many <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/324394/">other</a> areas? <br><br>  And the most important thing: in each sphere, there is one, strictly defined tendency - monopolization of a specific industry of the market, be it e-commerce (where integration, say, in the sale of household appliances has reached simply universal proportions, and profits - as it was not and not) taxi, retail or something else, say - messengers. <br><br>  The desire to subdue the latest Op.Sot.Svyazi is very strange, considering how exactly these very OSS have been developing their own technologies for many years now (for more details, <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/297208/">here</a> , <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/326416/">here</a> and <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/326336/">here</a> ). <br><br>  Everything is being done in a hurry: firstly, in order to be in time before the <a href="http%253A%252F%252Fwww.gosduma.net%252Flegislative%252Fplanning%252Fsession-shedule%252F%26usg%3DAFQjCNHhKFUfoMxvPBdVa7oLqOSs28NdSQ%26cad%3Drja">holidays</a> , and secondly, in the summer it is easier for citizens - they have other concerns. <br><br>  <s>And for some reason, 451 according to Gabriel Fahrenheit, I remember more and more ...</s> <br><br>  This is not the point: all these laws, in one way or another, are a violation of the principle of prohibiting censorship.  And, as already mentioned in previous posts, it will be harder and harder to bypass such taboos, and thus traffic to resources that are important for someone in particular will be less and less. <br><br>  Perhaps, in this way, both chambers of the Federal Assembly create, albeit purely artificially, all the conditions for the evolution of those for whom the political name is Russian?  Whatever it was, but in my opinion - the unbridled fun was over.  For everyone: is it time to not just look in the direction of an <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/329278/">uncensored</a> blockchain, but also to follow on? .. True, I don‚Äôt know where: they say, the Constitutional Court is less and less open to one of the forms of its decisions (aka - Definitions)? <br><br>  Perhaps you, the residents of Habr, will have constructive and working proposals on this subject? <br><br>  <i>PS I wanted to write a couple more laws, but I don‚Äôt even know if it is worth it ... Better, probably, the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/332300/">Golem</a> : yes, the holidays will be soon - maybe we will have time to figure it out for this break.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/332302/">https://habr.com/ru/post/332302/</a></p>
