But for other entrepreneurs, the site is an important advertising channel that brings the bulk of applications.  Even large developers today spend up to 75% of advertising budgets on the Internet, and only 25% on outdoor advertising, flyers, radio and magazines. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7ca/c95/209/7cac952094284b9a829cb3faf5ec1cfc.png"><br><br>  If the site is also important to you for sales, you are surely constantly looking for ways to improve it;  what to add to the site to catch more customers and get more calls. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And if you are interested in this, you could not help but hear about the landing pages - Landing Page.

      There has been a lot of information about landing pages in the past three three years.  They write articles about them, talk at conferences.  They promise that landing pages give a much higher conversion (a higher percentage of people who went to the page and called or made another useful action for you). <br><br>  Therefore, the question for the entrepreneur is relevant: is it worth developing landing pages in addition to the site?  When should it be done?  Or the site is enough, why spend the extra money? <br><br>  We have already <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/krible/blog/15518/">written</a> that many sites do not bring enough profit (and they could).  Therefore, we in <a href="http://www.krible.com/">Krieble</a> make tools with which you can receive more applications from the site without its large-scale rework.  And then it's a shame to spend on Yandex.Direct five hundred rubles a day and barely receive a couple of calls. <br><br>  Let's see today: what is the difference between a site and a landing page?  Do you need the last one or can you get by with some other solutions? <br><br><h4>  <font color="5194c2">What are landings for?</font> </h4><br>  For stocks, new or important products that need to be most beneficial to the buyer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6da/669/c4b/6da669c4bfe74e6fbd9c959b60bd7acd.png"><br><br>  The main task of the landing page is to answer all the user's questions within one page: <br><br><ul><li>  Customer problem shown </li><li>  Explains how a product or service can solve this problem. </li><li>  Many beautiful product photos or video review </li><li>  Answers to standard customer objections are written in advance to prevent all customer fears. </li><li>  There are certificates, reviews of other clients </li><li>  There is information about the supplier and delivery </li><li>  On the page there are many ‚Äúhooks‚Äù for the client: for example, an offer to buy right now to get a discount </li><li>  Convenient forms of communication are offered: online consultant, manager's call, application form, and so on. </li></ul><br>  That is, the person seems to be looking at a very beautiful, selling presentation, where each stage adds to his confidence that he needs to buy this product or service. <br><br><h4>  <font color="5194c2">Main Landing Differences from the Site</font> </h4><br>  <b>1. Landing has an order form, a call button and an online chat always before your eyes.</b> <br><br>  Many people, especially uncertain buyers, tend to postpone decisions indefinitely (‚ÄúI'll think about it‚Äù).  This does not mean that they do not want to buy, just need to send them, to help make a choice. <br><br>  Therefore, such elements must be constantly before the eyes of the buyer. <br><br>  <b>2. The call for actions is located not only on the buttons but also inside the page.</b> <br><br>  For example, when you click on the link ‚ÄúDetails‚Äù a person does not go to another page, instead, a callback call is activated. <br><br>  <b>3. Landing does not give the buyer the opportunity to go "walking" on other pages.</b> <br><br>  On a regular website, especially with a large number of pages and different links, a person can dig somewhere deep and completely forget about your product. <br><br>  <b>4. Landing does not let people go just like that.</b> <br><br>  If a person doesn‚Äôt do anything useful to us for a while, various pop-up windows with hot offers pop up, Timers ‚Äú8 hours left until the end of the action‚Äù and other elements. <br><br>  It may be annoying to some people, but what to do?  This is a business. <br><br>  The cost of a click in the context of growing, in many topics the cost of attracting a client is already even higher than the first sale.  To recoup advertising, you need to make one or two people a sale. <br><br>  Our market follows the same development path as the American and European markets.  And there Internet advertising is already very expensive.  For example, lawyers pay up to $ 200 just for an American user to click on their advertisements in Google. <br><br>  Therefore, letting go of a person without selling something to him or at least not taking contacts (phone / mail), in order to offer to buy again - this is throwing money into the wind and a quick bankruptcy. <br><br>  Thanks to all this "intrusiveness", Landings also work much better than usual sites. <br><br>  If a standard online store (just a website with a list of products and phones) has a conversion, at best it reaches 1% (one person out of a hundred bought), then landing pages yield 10% and more conversions.  Of course, it strongly depends on the subject and situation, but still, the effectiveness is many times higher. <br><br><h4>  <font color="5194c2">In the end, do you need a landing?</font> </h4><br>  Of course, this is a great tool.  But to make a decision, you need to calculate - whether the development of Landing will justify the costs. <br><br>  Developing a good Landing with a ‚Äúdelicious‚Äù design can take up to two weeks and cost from 10 to 60 thousand rubles (depending on the agency or freelancer you are referring to). <br><br>  And not the fact that you get a really good selling tool.  Many designers still do not know how to think business problems, and are engaged in decorating. <br><br>  But to abandon Landing is also not worth it.  It is much easier to put on the site our plugin, which has the main functions of landing: a call button to the manager, online chat, a form to send an application. <br><br>  Yes, it will not be an absolute replacement for Landing.  For a full replacement, you need to do a lot of work: rewrite texts, make professional photos, good design and layout, and so on. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8e5/8d2/eaf/8e58d2eaf67d417b8edb2ebff383ce18.png"><br><br>  But you get about 70% of the effectiveness of the landing, without paying, and 10% of the cost of its development. <br><br><ul><li>  call manager button </li><li>  online chat </li><li>  application form </li></ul><br>  To do this, insert the code of our service and a contact panel will appear on your site (on all pages!).  If people come to your site, you can literally feel the result during the first day. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d03/522/e53/d03522e53d6e4c2da58530c3132f9910.png"><br><br>  We are so sure of this that we give <a href="http://www.krible.com/">free access for 14 days</a> .  And if you do not notice an increase in conversion of at least 10%, we give the panel for free for another month. <br><br>  Good luck and good sales!  If you have any questions or any item you need to disclose in more detail - we will answer in the comments. <br><br> <a href="http://krible.com/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8fb/895/aea/8fb895aeae8c4bed90a6c113e778b75e.png"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290950/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290950/</a></p>
