Part One</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today, various models of multifunctional devices are widely represented on the market, which are designed to maximally provide a small or medium-sized office with network services based on a single device.  But among them, <a href="http://draytek-russia.ru/">Draytek</a> products <a href="http://draytek-russia.ru/">stand out</a> , just like a few years ago, this is due to the fact that the products of this particular vendor set the bar for simple, reliable and functional networked "combines" for the office.  The series of Draytek 2912 routers, which will be discussed, is the golden mean, which is where the level of functionality and performance of carrier-level routers is required, but the usual home or home + router is not enough to solve office network tasks.  In addition, the use of a single device is more economical than holding several devices for different tasks, if they are typical, for example, routing, firewall, VPN server, and so on.  Another key feature of Dryatek routers that made them popular all over the world is the quality and reliability that the company has invested in devices, starting with the quality of case materials, chips and components, and ending with the quality of embedded software.  Another feature of Draytek routers is ease of setup and intuitive interface, so many administrators and engineers like working with Dryatek.  By the way, with regard to documentation, there is also an order here, besides official manuals, there are many examples of configuring routers and integrating them with equipment from other manufacturers on the Internet and on Draytek sites. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ca4/00b/03f/ca400b03f085480aa15006cffc74f2a6.jpg"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This review will help to get acquainted in detail with the Draytek 2912 series of routers using the example of the 2912n model and includes two parts. <br><br>  In the first part, we will get acquainted with the diagrams of using the router as a whole and its individual functions, then we will look at its characteristics in detail, look at the appearance and configuration, interfaces and connectors, then test the device bandwidth. <br><br>  The second part will be devoted to a review of the web interface, its features and an example of setting up such functions and interfaces as WAN and LAN, Load-balancing, wireless network, VPN, firewall, NAT bandwidth control, as well as USB functions, diagnostics and monitoring of the router.

      The Draytek 2912 series of routers is currently represented by two models 2912 and 2912n.  The models differ in the presence of support for the 802.11n wireless network (speed up to 300Mbit \ c @ 2.4GHz) in the Draytek 2912n model, otherwise both models are the same.  Next, I will look at the Draytek 2912n model. <br><br><h2>  Key features of the device </h2><br><ul><li>  The Draytek 2912 series is ideal for the SOHO segment. </li><li>  All-in-one network harvester </li><li>  Powerful high-capacity office router </li><li>  Powerful Surge Protector </li><li>  CSM (Content Security Management) security management system </li><li>  WAN interface with redundancy and balancing of traffic between multiple WAN interfaces </li><li>  802.11n wireless network up to 300 Mbps (only for model 2912n) with the ability to create multiple wireless networks on one device </li><li>  VLAN support by port and tag-based. </li><li>  Support up to 16 VPN tunnels (using PPTP / L2TP / IPsec protocols) with hardware encryption and the ability to back up VPN connections (equipment officially imported into the territory of the Russian Federation supports only PPTP without encryption) </li><li>  Multifunctional USB port for connecting a printer or file sharing </li><li>  Possibility to connect 3G / 4G USB modems as WAN 3 via USB port </li><li>  Bandwidth Management with Intelligent VoIP QoS Mode </li><li>  IPv4 and IPv6 support </li><li>  Extensive web-based management or CLI command line </li><li>  Ability to use with the server for centralized management and monitoring of VigorACS SI </li><li>  TR-69 control protocol support </li><li>  Ability to connect to the Smart Monitor traffic analyzer and monitor up to 30 hosts. </li></ul><br><h2>  Draytek 2912 Usage Scheme </h2><br>  The Model 2912 is primarily an office router with the maximum set of features that may be required to create a transparent and efficient network infrastructure for a small office.  This example demonstrates the combined usage pattern of the router. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/89a/e52/3b0/89ae523b0d21de297d817eb9a18c496d.png"></div><br>  <font color="#999999">Fig.</font>  <font color="#999999">2</font> <br><br>  So, the first location is the head office, it has a powerful Draytek 3900 router, it also has a unified management and monitoring system for all Draytek routers used by a company called VigorACS SI, with which you can easily configure, update and monitor all routers in network, from one place, and there may be hundreds of devices on the network.  With the help of VPN tunnels, all offices are united with each other, in our example it is the head office, offices A and B, we installed Draytek 2912 and 2912n in them, offices are small and the performance of these routers is enough.  In office A, the router is connected to two Internet providers, via two WAN ports via Ethernet.  Traffic balancing between WAN interfaces is configured, so if one of the operators has a crash, Internet access will be preserved.  All employees' workplaces are connected via Wi-Fi, and several independent wireless networks are configured with their SSIDs, in the example, this is the Wireless network for office staff, and the Guest network is Guest, with limited access and limits on the number of simultaneous sessions from the device and maximum bandwidth, so that guests do not interfere with the work of staff.  Using the CSM content security system, employees are blocked from accessing social networks, using an online web content filter, the router checks for websites that employees want to access, and blocks unwanted ones.  A printer is connected via the USB port of the router, and the employees' PCs ‚Äúsee‚Äù it as a print server.  Remote employees can connect to the company's local network via VPN clients on their home computers using PPTP or IPSec.  In office B, the main provider is connected via Ethernet to WAN 1 of the Dryatek 2912 port, and via the USB port a 3G modem is connected, which is configured as WAN 3, and in case of an accident on the WAN 1 channel, the traffic will go through the 3G modem.  Employees' PCs, IP phones and servers are in different VLANs, QoS is configured, as the office uses IP phones.  For monitoring and analyzing network activity of users, the Draytek Smart Monitor solution is used, with which it is easy to understand how much traffic people consume and which web resources they visit. <br><br>  Now take a closer look at the key functions of the router. <br><br>  <b>Powerful office router with Internet connection redundancy, traffic balancing</b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b9d/18a/b52/b9d18ab5278bd075b5b7086544bba66a.png"></div><br>  <font color="#999999">Fig.</font>  <font color="#999999">3</font> <br><br>  The 2912 series routers have two WAN Fast Ethernet interfaces ‚Äî the main WAN port (W1 in the figure), 1 LAN port (W2 / P1 in the figure) can be configured as the second WAN2 port.  Between interfaces, traffic balancing and redundancy are configured; if two Internet providers are used in the event of an accident on the channel of one of them, the Internet will work in the office.  In addition to the redundancy of Ethernet providers, you can connect an Internet channel reservation via a 3G / 4G modem, which is inserted into the USB port of the router and becomes a WAN3 port. <br><br>  In addition, you can create routing rules (or address-based NAT translation) to specific WAN / LAN / VPN interfaces, for traffic from sources, and for destinations such as a host or subnet with optional indication of the protocol and port range.  The rule additionally indicates the backup interface to which traffic should be sent in case of failure of the main one. <br><br>  Each rule has a priority in the list, so if the first rule did not work, the next rule below the priority, if it is in the list, will apply. <br><br>  <b>Building a secure VPN network between offices or connecting remote workstations</b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3a6/f92/095/3a6f9209514332196fc0ab000c42b99b.png"></div><br>  <font color="#999999">Fig.</font>  <font color="#999999">four</font> <br><br>  The router supports up to 16 VPN * LAN-to-LAN tunnels to securely connect the organization's networks via the Internet or create VPN connections from remote workstations of homeworkers using the PPTP / IPSec / L2P / L2TPover IPSec protocols.  AES / DES / 3DES encryption and IKE authentication provide enhanced security.  Using a dual WAN connection allows you to use not only a load balancing scheme, but also redundancy.  Therefore, if the main channel of the VPN channel becomes unavailable, it will replace the backup VPN channel. <br><br>  By the way, the VPN functions in Draytek are very easy to configure.  In just a couple of clicks, you can configure both LAN-to-LAN connections and access from remote workstations.  Dryatek has its own VPN client to simplify connections from workplaces, it is called Draytek Smart VPN Client.  The application is available for free download on draytek.com <br><br>  <i>* In the official deliveries of routers to the territory of the Russian Federation, all software encryption tools that do not support GOST standards have been removed, therefore such firmware can only find PPTP support without encryption.</i>  <i>This can be circumvented by installing full-time software that can be downloaded from draytek.com.</i> <br><br>  <b>Secure networking for the office</b> <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b11/546/af9/b11546af9292a4ab2631b00aca836b74.jpg"></div><br>  <font color="#999999">Fig.</font>  <font color="#999999">five</font> <br><br>  The router supports the 802.11n wireless network and has two omni-directional antennas.  The settings of the wireless network functions in the router are large. <br><br>  The device supports up to 4 independent wireless networks with their own settings, and each of the networks can limit the maximum bandwidth for outgoing and incoming traffic, as well as enable the schedule according to which these restrictions will work.  For each of the 4x wireless networks, their own security settings are configured, including MAC address filters.  For each network, you can enable the Wi-Fi usage quota based on the MAC address and the timeout for re-quota provisioning. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0bd/fa1/c55/0bdfa1c55755b1d11c6c3d9a35b460df.jpg"></div><br>  <font color="#999999">Fig.</font>  <font color="#999999">6</font> <br><br>  You can also enable the web portal function to redirect to the desired web page of the user connecting to the Internet, as a company advertisement. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9e4/a0c/735/9e4a0c735e6f342012e4b836615293b4.png"></div><br>  <font color="#999999">Fig.</font>  <font color="#999999">7</font> <br><br>  Another important advantage: any of the four wireless networks and the LAN subnet can be combined and isolated from other networks, which increases security.  There can be 2 LAN subnets on the Draytek 2912 router. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7f3/c36/98d/7f3c3698d9a98e22c61acff139e03893.jpg"></div><br>  <font color="#999999">Fig.</font>  <font color="#999999">eight</font> <br><br>  <b>Powerful firewall with content filtering at the application level</b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bc0/9c2/aea/bc09c2aea5f73619c20ab910b6717a2e.jpg"></div><br>  <font color="#999999">Fig.</font>  <font color="#999999">9</font> <br><br>  The 2912 series routers support firewall with invisible testing of SPI (Stateful Packet Inspection) packets based on Object-based objects, such as a user (he gets a specific IP during authorization), an IP address or groups of IP addresses, a protocol and a range ports and their groups, keywords and keyword groups, file extension profiles.  These objects can be used to create firewall rules that can be turned on and off on a schedule. <br><br>  The CSM content security system (Content Security Management) is an application-level firewall subsystem that allows you to block UR links by keywords and content type, for example, Java Applet, Cookies, Active X, you can also block various network applications, for example , IM / P2P or application level protocols, for example, MySQL, SMB, SSH, UltraVPN, the list of services and protocols is quite impressive.  It is also possible to block DNS by keywords. <br><br>  Another powerful tool that contains CSM is the GlobalView Web Content Filter system.  It is designed to filter unwanted content at the thematic level, that is, for example, sites with the theme of porn, crime, gambling, and more.  The administrator creates profiles where he specifies the subject of the sites and assigns them to the firewall rules, then indicates what to do if the rule matches, for example, block.  Web Content Filter is licensed, but a trial license for testing can be obtained free of charge. <br><br>  The router implements detection and automatic protection against DoS attacks, and the traffic threshold metrics, after which the event is considered an attack, can be configured manually.  Also provides for sending notifications about the attack.  In general, a firewall can operate in one of two global modes: <br><br>  ‚ÄúRule-Based, that is, based on rules, where objects, for example, the IP addresses of user stations, the administrator sets the rules based on different IP addresses. <br><br>  ¬ªUser-Based, that is, management based on user profiles, the administrator sets the rules for different user profiles.  Before this, users must log in. <br><br>  <b>Bandwidth Management and QoS Quality Assurance</b> <br>  The router has a wide range of QoS QoS tuning capabilities to solve a typical situation ‚Äî the correct prioritization of delay-critical traffic over the traffic of services that require such priorities.  Moreover, the router, by default, automatically detects real-time traffic, and gives it priority over other types of traffic.  For example, VoIP calls.  In addition to the QoS settings, there are ample opportunities to control the bandwidth and set the limit on the expenditure of traffic for both individual IP addresses and groups of IP addresses.  You can specify how much traffic and for how long will be given to one or another user at full speed, after the limit is exhausted, the speed will be reduced to a certain threshold.  It is possible to limit the number of simultaneous sessions to specific IPs or IP ranges, as well as the maximum number of simultaneous default sessions. <br><br>  To enable and disable rules, it is possible to create a seven-day schedule, up to 15 intervals. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c3b/636/350/c3b636350cc43fecbf2a90a1ece6d285.png"></div><br>  <font color="#999999">Fig.</font>  <font color="#999999">ten</font> <br><br>  <b>The possibility of multipurpose use of the USB port in the modes of the print server, file storage, 3G / 4G modem connection</b> <br>  The router has a USB port that can be used in one of three modes.  First, connect a USB 3G / 4G modem to reserve an Internet connection or as a basic Internet connection, if there is no other way to connect to the Internet. <br><br>  Secondly, connect the USB printer to the router, which becomes the print server and users will be able to use it by setting up access to it over the network. <br><br>  Third, connect a USB drive and share files with FTP or NetBios / SMB. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c81/ea2/e9b/c81ea2e9bd6b4e623dcbb76f84556bd5.png"></div><br>  <font color="#999999">Fig.</font>  <font color="#999999">eleven</font> <br><br>  <b>Smart Monitor Traffic Analysis System</b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/867/436/2d7/8674362d7a408762a685e26ebb4a15fd.jpg"></div><br>  <font color="#999999">Fig.</font>  <font color="#999999">12</font> <br><br>  Smart Monitor was created primarily to solve network problems by monitoring and analyzing network traffic, the application helps administrators to find and solve problems with network applications.  For example, monitor traffic of various types, create detailed reports on the use of traffic by users to export them and even send by e-mail, there is a ranking of TOP10 for maximum use of network resources, for example, TOP10 for using IM messengers or file downloads, you can also rank the use of various network protocols and take this information into account when configuring the router so that users feel comfortable working.  For illustration below are several screenshots. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/99b/475/da1/99b475da1e79517e95e4e8a709a58f61.png"></div><br>  <font color="#999999">Fig.</font>  <font color="#999999">13</font> <br><br>  The application helps to solve problems of misuse of working time and unwanted leakage of confidential information.  For example, monitor the abuse of IM messengers and the transfer of confidential information outside the company, the time spent on social networks, find users who download channels by downloading large files or streaming video, etc.  With the help of SmartMonitor, you can monitor user activity: read e-mail, chat in IM messengers, view the files they downloaded. <br><br>  For illustration below are some screenshots. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ce8/af9/cac/ce8af9cacc9a09348dd781b2977fd33d.jpg"></div><br>  <font color="#999999">Fig.</font>  <font color="#999999">14</font> <br><br>  The interception function is useful for recovering data in the event of its loss by the user or solving controversial situations.  For example, listening to VoIP conversations or recovering accidentally deleted emails.  Naturally, you can view the addresses of sites that were visited by specific users.  With regard to the separation of rights: in the application, you can create accounts with privileges to view information only for certain users, for example, only sales staff. <br><br>  The Smart Monitor application captures and analyzes traffic that is mirrored from the specified LAN ports of the router to the Mirror port.  The port of the server on which the Smart Monitor application is installed is connected to the Mirror port, traffic from this port is saved, and then ‚Äúdisassembled‚Äù by the application.  Therefore, there can be two ports on the server: one for mirroring the traffic for the second for control.  The important point is that only the traffic of the LAN pots is mirrored from the router, the wireless traffic is not mirrored, therefore, it is not processed. <br><br>  The application consists of several components, such as Apahe web server with PHP, WinPcap, installed on your computer in a few clicks.  The Smart Monitor interface works through a web browser.  To do this, open the server's IP in the browser, then enter the login and password to access the system.  The minimum hardware requirements for a system of 30 hosts are modest: Intel P4 1.4GHz / AMD CPU, 20 GB for HDD and 1GB of RAM.  Supported OS Windows XP / 7, Linux. <br><br>  By the way, the application is free software.

Using the VigorACS SI system significantly reduces equipment maintenance costs from the service provider (operator) or system integrator.  In general, the system deserves a separate review as it is very functional. <br><br>  The following advantages of using the Draytek VigorACS SI system can be highlighted: <br>  Centralized management.  The VigorACS SI architecture allows you to centrally manage various types of Draytek devices, such as routers, even if the devices are behind NAT.  Management of any device is made from a single interface.  Management can be as a group of devices, as well as a separate device. <br><br>  Reduced support costs.  One of the main tasks of the VigorACS SI system is to reduce the number of calls to the technical support service and the time needed to eliminate problems that arise.  The system allows administrators to easily find and fix problems thanks to a simple intuitive interface, the ability to differentiate access rights and audit settings made by other users.  The system provides detailed statistics on the operation of all devices, notification of events, and alarm notifications, the ability to remotely control devices. <br><br>  Automation of the entire cycle of setting and operating equipment.  The system can be useful both to service providers and system integrators who want to simplify and automate the installation and maintenance of equipment as much as possible. <br><br>  Save time.  Automatic configuration allows you to significantly reduce the time spent on installing new devices and reconfiguring existing ones, and as a result, save money. <br><br>  Monitoring and analysis.
