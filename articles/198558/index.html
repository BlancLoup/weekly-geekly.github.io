    <h4>  All in one: the Nokia Lumia 2520 tablet </h4><br>  We present you our first tablet, the Nokia Lumia 2520, running on Windows 8.1 RT. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ‚ÄúEverything in your PC or laptop is saved and uploaded to your tablet, which weighs a little over a pound and is only 8.9 mm thick,‚Äù says project manager Paul Bischof.  - Most modern devices are used to consume information, rather than to create it.  We believe that there is a demand for the creation of information, which we are able to satisfy. <br>  That is why we created the Lumia 2520, a tablet that people can use throughout the day and for everything they want to do. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/054/cce/b5a/054cceb5ad2f22337059555e152b054c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Nokia Lumia 2520 is ideal for life in motion, largely due to the large number of functions that allow you to be aware of everything.  The 10.1-inch 1080p high-definition screen, made of durable Gorilla Glass 2 glass, gives far less glare and reflection, unlike other tablets;  An improved brightness range and a wide viewing angle allow you to work under different lighting conditions, and a 4G-LTE modem and Wi-Fi provide lightning fast internet connection regardless of where you are. <br><br>  All the hardware, including the powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 processor, was chosen to work seamlessly with the touch screen and OS and work efficiently without heating the battery. <br><br>  The Lumia 2520 easily copes with tests such as playing video for ten hours non-stop without recharging.  Thanks to the new battery design, charging time has been significantly reduced, for example, charging from 0 to 80% takes about an hour. <br><br>  Along with the Nokia Lumia 2520, we are pleased to introduce the Nokia Power Keyboard, which will become the best companion for your tablet.  Each keyboard will be equipped with a touchpad and supplemented with a cover that provides maximum protection for your tablet.  The Nokia Power Keyboard also has a second battery, which increases the use time by five additional hours, and two USB ports for connecting other devices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/df7/663/7ff/df76637ff1fb7beb66b9d82ff0978d81.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the back of the tablet is a 6.7-megapixel camera with ZEISS optics and a F1.9 aperture, which ensures high quality images and video even in low light.  Two new applications from Nokia - Storyteller and Video Director - will help you to process the created content and quickly share it with your friends.  On the front panel is a second, 2 megapixel camera, designed for video calls. <br><br>  Windows 8.1 makes it easy to install the full version of Microsoft Outlook, as well as other Microsoft Office programs.  In addition, thanks to Nokia, you will be the first to see the new version of the HERE Maps application, with the help of which you can now quickly navigate in any terrain even without an internet connection.  In addition, the Nokia Music application for free listening to music online and offline, is not left behind and will be available on our tablet. <br><br>  Nokia Lumia 2520 will be presented in four primary colors: red and blue, white and black.  The start of sales is scheduled in several countries at once: USA, UK, Finland and Russia.  Approximately the price of a tablet in the world will be about $ 459, prices in Russia will be announced later. <br><br><h4>  Nokia Lumia 1520 and 1320 </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b7c/b68/a21/b7cb68a2146292956e697ece3cc75194.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The new Nokia Lumia 1520 and Lumia 1320 smartphones successfully combine the very best of Windows Phone and the unique Lumia style with six-inch screens.  They are not just anymore - now you can place more live icons on the screen for quick access to information and applications. <br><br>  Nokia Lumia 1520 became the owner of 1080p Full HD display, a 20 megapixel PureView camera with optical image stabilization, advanced sensor technology and zoom ‚Äî all compatible with the latest version of the Nokia Camera application.  And thanks to the Nokia Storyteller app, you can easily remember the best moments of your life and be able to share them with your family and friends. <br><br>  Nokia Storyteller automatically integrates photos from your phone with geolocation and creates a chronological picture of your travels on the map with the HERE Maps application.  Look for interesting places, get contact information and check user reviews directly with Nokia Storyteller.  The application automatically plays animated pictures, videos and photos, literally enlivening them. <br><br>  But that's not all!  We are glad to please you: Twitter Vine and Instagram are now available for Windows Phone 8, create your own Vine and photos, edit them and share with your friends! <br><br>  The Nokia Rich Recording app on the Lumia 1520 smartphone records sound from four built-in microphones, providing stereo effect, high quality and a complete lack of interference.  Do you want to share with friends not only a photo or an interesting place found, but an image from your camera in real time, broadcasting it to any compatible screen?  Now this is possible with the Nokia Beamer app!  Share whatever you like with your friends, whether they are on the other side of the world or near you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f1/215/ca9/4f1215ca9f882100a8797563f6092b22.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Lumia 1520 - a real workhorse with built-in Microsoft Office, which will help you work at any time from your smartphone.  One of its advantages is a capacious battery with a wireless charger (Qi-compatible).  The combination of these qualities means that you can easily do work or enjoy, for example, watching movies without worrying about charging. <br><br>  An additional improvement of the screen was the appearance of the third column of live icons, simplifying work and allowing you to quickly find your favorite application.  For example, mail now additionally displays a news column in real time. <br><br>  Often make video calls?  With the front camera Lumia 1520, you can hold video conferencing in Skype with a resolution of HD 720p and a wide viewing angle, while you will always look your best.  And the application Papyrus, first published on Windows Phone, will easily make a handwritten note when there is no paper and pen at hand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/caf/d30/b62/cafd30b62ba30ea175a82a7b590745ba.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The smartphone will also delight all gamers.  With a Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 processor, 1080p high-quality HD display and rich Xbox graphics, it will explode your imagination.  All this is complemented by 2 GB of internal RAM, storage capacity of 32 GB and the ability to expand memory using MicroSD-cards up to 64 GB, as well as 7 GB of free cloud storage SkyDrive. <br><br>  The six-inch Lumia 1520 display combines all the innovative and cutting-edge ideas: with ClearBlack technology, high brightness mode and Apical technology - you will enjoy images and video on your screen even in the brightest sun, and thanks to the sensitive touch screen gloves in the winter will no longer be a hindrance . <br><br>  Lead designer Lumia 1520, Ilkka Husgafvel, said that the main purpose of creating a new smartphone was to combine simplicity and a large screen, while at the same time the smartphone turned out to be quite thin - 8.7 mm thick.  On the sides of the phone are ceramic buttons and a latent image, which you will see by looking at it from the front. <br><br>  The smartphone will be available in four colors: yellow, white, black and glossy red. <br><br><h4>  Nokia Lumia 1320 is getting bigger for less money </h4><br>  Like the Lumia 1520, the Lumia 1320 has a 6-inch display: the device implements a number of solutions typical of the top models of the Lumia line, but at a more affordable price.  The newest functionalities for working with images, such as Nokia Camera and Nokia Storyteller, as well as the most popular Lumia applications - HERE and Nokia Mix Radio, a cartographic and geolocation service with unlimited streaming music without ads - together create an attractive smartphone for users with large display. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b6a/50e/c54/b6a50ec5469afbbac914188a0c5c2c80.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  With the latest applications from Nokia and Microsoft, supporting LTE-connection, you will get the most out of the bright screen on the Lumia 1320. Relax and unwind while playing the latest Xbox news, reading the news or watching movies on the big screen.  A considerable amount of information can be saved using free 7 GB in SkyDrive or on a microSD card with a maximum expansion of up to 64 GB. <br><br><h4>  When can I buy it? </h4><br>  The expected start of sales of the Nokia Lumia 1520 is scheduled for this quarter in Hong Kong, Singapore, USA, China and Europe (including Finland, France, Germany and the UK).  Approximately the price of a smartphone in the world will be about $ 749, prices in Russia will be announced later. <br><br>  The Nokia Lumia 1320 will be available in orange, yellow, black or white.

This combination made it possible to create beautiful reflections of color and light without increasing the size and weight. <br><br>  Fastlane Magazine is the key to the new Asha platform.  Swipe-record your past, present, and future: quick access to notifications, reminders, and everything else that matters to you.
