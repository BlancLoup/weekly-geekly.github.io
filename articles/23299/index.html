    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Gold medals also received: the team of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (USA), which took the second place and became the champion of North America, the team of the Izhevsk State Technical University, which took the third place, and the team of the Lviv National University named after them won the fourth place.  Ivan Franko. <br><br>  The team of the Moscow State University named after M. Gorky took the silver medals.  University, Xinhua University (China), which took the sixth place, also became the champion of Asia, Stanford University (USA), the seventh place team and the University of Zagreb (Croatia), the eighth place. <br>  Teams of the University of Waterloo (Canada), Petrozavodsk State University, St. Petersburg State University and Belarusian State University took places from 9 to 12, respectively, and were awarded bronze medals. <br><br>  The new world and European champions - the team of St. Petersburg State University of Information Technologies, Mechanics and Optics - were among the top ten teams in the Northeastern Semifinals of the World Programming Championship in 2005 and 2006, taking 10 and 7 places respectively, however, due to that the World Championship rules did not allow two teams representing one university to participate in the finals, another team from SPSU ITMO went into the final, which took second place in the semi-finals.  This year, the team consisting of Dmitry Abdrashitov, Dmitry Parashchenko and Fyodor Tsarev left no chances to competitors in the semifinals, taking first place and returning the title of champion of Russia to SPSU ITMO - in 2005 and 2006 the team of Moscow State University was the champion of Russia.  After the victory, the team continued to work hard, took third place in the IV Open Memory Programming Cup.  Pankratieva, showed consistently high results at the open training sessions organized regularly at St. Petersburg State University ITMO - and as a result, the debut in the World Cup final was victorious.  Thus, after a one-year break, the title of World and European Champions was again won by the Russian team. <br>  The team coach, laureate of the President of the Russian Federation, Andrei Sergeyevich Stankevich, did a lot of work to prepare the team for the final, and this gave its results.  At the same time, other Russian finalist teams participated in the open training sessions of St. Petersburg State University ITMO, conducted via the Internet.  Interestingly, the teams of SPSU ITMO won gold medals for 6 of the last 8 years (in 2004 and 2008 - the world champions, in 2001, 2003, 2005 and 2007 - the third place), which is a unique achievement.  The head of the ITMO training system created at SPSU ITMO is the winner of the President's Award of the Russian Federation, Professor Vladimir Glebovich Parfenov, who is the director of the Northeast semi-final zone of the World Championship. <br><br>  The team of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for the third year in a row has become the champion of North America.  Last year, the team won 4th place and gold medals, this year, despite the change in the composition of the team (according to the rules of the World Championship, participation in more than two finals is impossible), MIT was able to improve its result.  And next year, the American team, which can retain its composition, will be one of the contenders for victory in the World Cup. <br><br>  In the third-place team of Izhevsk State Technical University, Evgeny Kuzyakov and Victor Kamashev are the debutants of the final, and for Alexander Skidanov this is the second final - in 2005 Alexander participated in the final as part of the IzhSTU team, which took the 9th place and was awarded bronze medals.  In this line-up, the team ranked second in the Northeast semi-finals of the 2007 World Championship, becoming the vice-champions of Russia.  In general, the performances of the teams of Izhevsk State Technical University in the finals of the World Championships are unique: all three times the team was awarded medals: silver in 2004, bronze in 2005, and now third place and gold medals.  The team of Izhevsk GTU teams is headed by associate professor Vladimir Georgievich Tarasov, who is also a major organizer of programming competitions in the region: in particular, in the winter of 2008 in Izhevsk, under his leadership, a programming programming seminar was held, in which about 30 teams participated, representing as the Ural region , and, for example, Moscow, Arkhangelsk, Rostov or Taganrog.  And the management of IzhSTU plans to make this kind of school annual. <br><br>  The team of the Lviv National University.  Ivan Franko as part of Vasil Biletsky, Ostap Korkuny and Ruslan Babili became the first Ukrainian team to win gold medals in the final of the World Programming Championship.  Ukraine, along with Moldova, participates not in the Northeast semi-final (like the other post-Soviet states), but in the Southeast.  This season, the first three places in the South-Eastern World Cup semi-finals were taken by the Ukrainian teams, and the Lviv OU team decided all 9 proposed tasks in 2 hours out of the 5 allotted, thereby setting a kind of semi-finals record.  And the confirmation of the high-class team shown in the semifinals was an excellent performance in the final and a gold medal at the World Championships.  By the way, from the third place the team of Lviv NU was separated only 2 minutes. <br><br>  Russian teams as a whole showed outstanding results in the World Cup finals, winning the champion title, two gold, one silver and two bronze medals.  Teams of the northeastern semi-final zone (which includes all post-Soviet states, except for Ukraine and Moldova) received exactly half of all medals awarded (6 out of 12), which in itself is a record achievement.  At the suggestion of the President of Petrozavodsk State University VN Vasilyev, who was present at the finals, it was decided to dedicate the Russian teams to the 2008 World Championships in memory of one of the founders of Russian programming competitions, the oldest coach of Russian student teams, the founder and director of the Open Programming Cup, coach and team leader MSU Evgeny Vasilyevich Pankratiev, who tragically died in January 2008. <br><br>  The MSU team, which took fifth place and was awarded silver medals, was composed of Ivan Popelyshev, Mikhail Levin and Yevgeny Shavlyugin, and was also formed under the leadership of E.V.  Pankratieva, and his son, a senior teacher of MSU, Anton Evgenievich Pankratiev, who continues his father's business, came to Canada as a team coach.  The team includes the 2005 Russian champion and bronze medalist of the 2006 World Cup, Ivan Popelyshev, 2006 Russian champion and bronze medalist of the 2007 World Championship, Mikhail Levin, gold medalist of the 2004 International Computer Science Olympiad, Yevgeny Shavlyugin.  Despite the inevitable difficulties in the formation of a team made up of representatives of various teams that had competed in the past, the Moscow State University team showed a decent result, and if not for the offensive hitch at the start (the first task was delivered more than an hour after the start of the competition), such a performance could confidently claim gold medals.  The organization of the Moscow State University team‚Äôs trip to the World Cup final was assisted by Yandex, with which MSU cooperates in organizing the Open Programming Cup - the largest regular multi-stage team programming competition in which, unlike the championships held by the ACM, participate, including the strongest teams of past years. <br><br>  The team of Petrozavodsk State University, consisting of Vyacheslav Medvedev, Maxim Spirichev and Ivan Arkhipov, showed the best result among the teams that solved 6 tasks, took 10th place and was awarded a bronze medal.  This is the second medal of Petrozavodsk University in a row: last year the team of PetrSU received a bronze medal and 13th place, so a step forward was made, even if only a small one.  It is interesting to note that last year's bronze medalist, the strongest team of Petrozavodsk State University according to the results of the season, made up of 2 and 3 year students, decided to completely miss the 2008 World Championship - and it turned out that their result was surpassed by their senior colleagues. <br><br>  Let us note the enormous contribution of Petrozavodsk State University to the preparation of teams participating in the World Programming Championship: for more than 5 years, fees for the strongest Russian - and now foreign - teams have been organized in Petrozavodsk.  So, in the success of all the teams participating in the training camps, and this is the world champions - the team of St. Petersburg University of Information Technologies, Mechanics and Optics, and all Russian, Belarusian and Ukrainian teams - championship winners - have a great merit of the organizers of fees, including PetrSU team coach Denis Petrovich Vlasov.  In addition, great attention is paid to the preparation of teams in Petrozavodsk University: PetrSU President VN Vasilyev is present in the finals of the university delegation. <br><br>  The team of St. Petersburg State University which took the eleventh place in the ranks of Sergey Kopeliovich, Oleg Davydov and Yuri Petrov at the beginning of the competition was in the lead, but later spent a lot of time and penalty attempts on one of the tasks and was able to win only bronze medals.  Taking into account the achievements of the team members - Sergey Kopeliovich, the gold medals of the International School Olympiad in Informatics 2005 and 2006, the title of TopCoder High School Tournament 2007 winner (World Programming Championship among schoolchildren held by TopCoder) from Yuri Petrov - one could count on a higher the result, especially since the St. Petersburg State University team was considered by experts as one of the favorites of the championship.  However, the team has yet another performance in the final to draw appropriate conclusions and try to improve the result.  The team coach, Andrei Sergeevich Lopatin, being a participant in the World Programming Championship, achieved a unique result, becoming the double world champion in 2000 and 2001.  Now A.S.  Lopatin not only directs the preparation of student teams, but also plays a key role in conducting training camps for the International Olympiads in Informatics for Schoolchildren, heads the Russian team at these Olympiads. <br><br>  At the twelfth place is the team of the Belarusian State University, consisting of Pavel Irzhavsky, Nikita Lesnikov and Vladimir Kerus.  For the team, this is already the second final - in the first performance it was less successful.  Nikita Lesnikov and Vladimir Kerus in different years represented Belarus at the International School Olympiad in Informatics: Nikita Lesnikov won the bronze medal at the 2005 Olympiad and gold at the 2006 Olympiad, Vladimir Kerus won silver at IOI-2003 and 2004, and bronze at IOI-2005.  So, the medal of the 32nd World Championship was added to the medals won at school age.  The team coach is Professor Vladimir M. Kotov, one of the leading organizers of programming competitions in Belarus. <br><br>  The results of other teams representing Russia and the CIS are as follows: <br>  The teams of Altai State Technical University and Vinnytsia National Technical University solved 4 tasks and took 31 and 32 places respectively, the teams of Ural State University and Novosibirsk State University solved 5 tasks and took 23 and 25 places respectively, the teams of Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, Orlovsky State Technical University and Stavropol State University decided on 6 tasks and took 13th, 16th and 18th places respectively. <br><br>  The result shown by the teams of Russia and the CIS in the finals is all the more valuable because the favorites of the competition, World and European champions of 2007 - the team of the University of Warsaw, who finished in 14th place and lost, in addition to the medalists, also took 13th place the team first presented in the final of the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (Daniil Shved, Mikhail Kostin, Igor Kvasov, team coach - Yevgeny Yakovlevich Barsky). <br>  It is possible that participation in the 2008 winter gatherings in Petrozavodsk together with the Warsaw team, which became the winner in the overall standings collection, helped the Russian teams to realistically assess their current level of training and make the necessary adjustments for the time remaining to the final.  Thus, joint training with the participation of strong foreign teams can be a very significant help in preparing for major programming competitions. <br><br>  The ACM World Programming Championships have been held since 1977, according to a multi-level system (first qualifying competition, then final).  From 1977 to 1985, only North American teams participated in the competition.  The first non-North American team to take part in the competition was a team from New Zealand that participated in 1986.  After the leadership of the championship moved to the Baylor University, San Antonio, and Bill Pucher became head of the competition, and to this day, more and more teams from outside North America began to take part in the competition, and since 1991 receive the status of the World Programming Championship, and the winner is declared the World Champion.  The final competitions are held in different cities: for example, in 2005 the final part of the competition was held in Shanghai, in 2004 - in Prague.  But most often - 26 times out of 31 - finals were held in the USA.  The general sponsor of the competition since the 1997-1998 season is IBM. <br><br>  <strong>Fact sheet</strong> <br><br>  According to the rules of the World Championship, teams of universities composed of 3 participants can participate in the competition.  Each participant must be a student or graduate student of the relevant university, while performance of more than two finals is prohibited for one person. <br><br>  During the competition (usually it is five hours) each team of three participants is provided with one computer with software development tools installed on it and access to the system of automatic (or semi-automatic, as is customary in the final) testing.  To solve the participants are usually offered from 8 to 12 tasks.  The solution of each task should be a program in one of the programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãaccepted at the competition (this year it is Java, C, C ++).  If the team believes that the solution is ready, it sends it for testing.  The verification system tests the solution on a test set pre-set by the author of the task.  If at some test the program incorrectly ended, exceeded the time specified in the problem statement for one test, or gave an incorrect answer, the team receives a brief error message.  In this case, the test itself, on which an error occurred, is not reported to the team.  If the program correctly works on all tests, then the team‚Äôs task is counted, in addition, the time from the start of the competition to the time of the task‚Äôs completion, as well as 20 minutes for each unsuccessful solution sent for this task, is added to the ‚Äúpenalty time‚Äù.  The team that has solved the most tasks wins, and if there are several such teams, then the team that received the least ‚Äúpenalty time‚Äù among them. <br><br>  The scheme of distribution of medals changed from year to year, until recently the following option was established: places from 1 to 4 receive gold medals, places from 5 to 8 - silver, places from 9 to 12 - bronze.  Next come the teams that have solved the same number of tasks as the team that took 13th place, who have the 13th as their place (that is, ‚Äúpenalty time‚Äù is not counted for these teams, and they are listed alphabetically in the list), then - teams that solved one task less than 13th place (they all also have the same place), and so on, until the number of teams that have solved this or fewer tasks is more than half of all the final teams.  The rest of the teams receive Honorable Mention, that is, the certificate of the participant without specifying a place. <br><br>  The selection for the final competition is carried out according to a multistage scheme: all the universities of the world are divided into regions (by territory), in which the semi-finals are held.  The largest regions are divided into subregions, and the selection to the semifinals is based on the results of the quarter finals.  Moreover, in some regions (for example, in China) 1/8 finals are already held.        ,       ,             .       ,       , ,  ,    .        ‚Äî      ,         . <br><br>    ,       ,        ,    1995 .      ,   1993 ,        .   1996        ‚Äî    (    NWERC  )   (    SWERC  ).   1996-1997       -   (NEERC),     ,    ,    SEERC.
