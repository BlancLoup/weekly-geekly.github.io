  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Zune wins iPod if it turns into a PDA</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The output <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/article/1258/">of the Zune player</a> was <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/blog/microsoft/2319.html">not</a> perceived <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/blog/microsoft/2319.html">as warm</a> as Microsoft marketers expected.  Experts are trying to understand what Microsoft‚Äôs marketing miscalculation is and how the company can remedy the situation.  There are few doubts that she will correct the situation and eventually achieve leadership in this market.  After all, the entire history of Microsoft‚Äôs development shows that the world's largest IT company is perfectly capable of copying the innovative ideas of competitors and adapting them to the mass market, gaining the leading role on it.  It is likely that the story will repeat with a portable player. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It is clear that the battle between Zune and iPod is just beginning.  Opponents just took the starting position and made the first steps.  There are years of struggle ahead, and Microsoft has a clear advantage here in financial resources and other administrative levers.  The Zune product may well be worse than the iPod in its consumer qualities, but at the same time get more market share.  However, Microsoft is clearly trying to surpass its competitor and technologically.  How it turns out? <br><br>  Judging by the first reviews of the Zune, technological leadership is given with difficulty.  The huge potential that is embedded in WiFi is not fully realized.  The large display is a fiction because the resolution remains the same.  The Zune device itself turned out quite overall and heavy compared to the iPod.  Engineers do not even round the corners, due to which the design seems even more heavy.  The fake wheel is also not impressive. <br><br>  The Zune device does not work in any OS other than WinXP, it is not compatible with many music formats, such as DivX, OGG, protected by WMV and WMA-DRM9.  Worse, Zune software doesn't even support podcasts.  A huge number of problems in the field of usability.

      Of course, the company can correct all errors and release a new version of proprietary software.  But this is not enough to "kill the iPod."  How can you beat a competitor?  One possible way out: <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do%3Fcommand%3DprintArticleBasic%26articleId%3D9005366">turn the Zune into a full-fledged handheld computer</a> . <br><br>  In fact, after all, Microsoft will never make the player more elegant and beautiful than Apple.  Due to what can make it more popular?  Here the same method is suitable, due to which Windows-based computers defeated Apple computers, that is, a variety of software. <br><br>  If the iPod is a narrow-function device, then Zune can position itself as a universal computer running Windows, for which the most diverse software is available from various manufacturers. <br><br>  Apple forbids modifying its devices and does not encourage those enthusiasts who are trying to crack the firmware and install on the iPod, for example, some games or a text editor.  So, Microsoft should allow all these modifications, meet users, equip Zune with programs for reading electronic books, for working with e-mail, for VoIP-telephony via WiFi - and then only Apple‚Äôs marginals remain among Apple users. <br><br>  Recently, Steve Ballmer said he was preparing to release a phone based on the Zune.  Let's see how the Zune-iPod battle will continue in the mobile market, although here Microsoft should have a huge advantage due to the experience in developing software for mobile communicators. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4716/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4716/</a></p>
