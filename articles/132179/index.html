    <h4>  The first day.  Separating light from darkness </h4><br>  So.  All that we have is a bunch of information dust: the desire, requirements, ideas, posts on Habr√© and forum threads.  And today our main task is to choose the right directions of movement and finally understand what is good and what is bad. <br><br>  Do not try to sit down to write specifications.  Dedicate this day to fighting the hangover and communication with anyone who will somehow be associated with this project. <br><br>  Talk to the customer, talk to users, listen to skeptics, drink alcohol, eat a delicious lunch with homemade soup, and when you're ready, open the notebook and start creating. <br><br>  Write down what is really important. <br><br>  More important development speed or performance? <br>  Will it be a set of use-cases or a few screens to configure everything and everyone? <br><br>  Pay attention to the description of the ideology of the project. <br>  What you create today will become the axioms of your new world. <br><br><h4>  Second day.  Heavenly firmament.  What will be outside and what's inside. </h4><br>  Any system lives in the outside world, and interacts with other worlds.  Therefore, today we need to understand how we will be built into the environment, how our research can affect the world around us, and how to mitigate the consequences of our actions. <br><br>  Walk the path of the user from start to finish, explore the subject area as well as software that is already used for these purposes in the company.  Your main question today is ‚Äúhow do you do it‚Äù. <br><br>  Remember, the more you can use from what is already there, the better for everyone - you don‚Äôt have to learn new things, and you‚Äôll have to write much less code. <br><br><h4>  Third day.  Land and vegetation. </h4><br>  So.  Today we are ready to start creating the first shoots of life. <br>  Use the software for prototyping interfaces and create simple, basic sketches of our world.  No need to work out every detail.  For this, there are UI designers.  But you must prepare the base for them.  After all, you're the main one here, after all. <br><br><h4>  Day four.  Luminaries. </h4><br>  Now we come to the technical part of the project.  What programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãand frameworks will you use?  What technologies will you be based on, and what advantages will it give you. <br><br>  Do not use funds that do not fit your ideology.  The lower the entropy, the better. <br><br>  Thoughts categories and abstractions.  A prototype interface will help you see how everything will work. <br><br>  Think about how you will feed the data to your algorithms, and how the simplifications created will help you. <br><br>  How will the components of the system interact with each other and the outside world? <br>  How will you handle errors, what failures are possible in the system, what is their priority? <br><br>  Creating the right cement that holds all the parts together is a very important stage, and maximum standardization here (albeit redundant to date) will help in the future not to think about growth problems. <br><br><h4>  Fifth day.  Living creatures. </h4><br>  And here it is the long-awaited Friday.  Last working day, and in this wonderful time you have to breathe life into the system.  Today you will register the first user of the system.  Call him Adam.  Or admin as you like. <br><br>  Teach him to interact with the system.  He does not need to know everything about the world, it‚Äôs enough just to live in it - in time he will know your wisdom and become perfect. <br><br>  And now ... Now you can turn on the counter-strike, and arrange a massive mess with your neighbors. <br><br>  Great accomplishments and falls are coming, but this is not about today - you need to have a good rest. <br><br>  After all, not every day in the universe creates another world. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/132179/">https://habr.com/ru/post/132179/</a></p>
