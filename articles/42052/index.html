  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Full-scale project development</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Something today can not sleep at all ... Perhaps this is the very sign that I have been waiting for?  I needed a sign to decide to begin a series of articles based on the <em>actual</em> development of a medium-sized project.  But not just about developing in the general sense of the word, and not even about developing on the basis of the Zend Framework, Doctrine ORM, etc., but about developing from the formulation of the problem, analyzing and designing (with the necessary degree of depth), searching for solutions and implementation. <br>  And since the first paragraph has already been typed, I don‚Äôt see any reason to stop :) I invite everyone to participate in the <em>process</em> that will be held on the basis of UP. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Since I don‚Äôt have any schedules and plans yet, I can safely say that you, my readers, will be in the very center of events, and I hope that events will take place at least once a week :) <br>  So.  What I still want to offer :) Firstly - for me this series of articles will be educational and systematizing.  That is, I myself want to deepen knowledge and decompose them in the end, on the shelves, as well as experience the benefits of a <em>full-fledged</em> project with preliminary design (the benefit here I am the boss and you can allocate as much time as necessary). <br>  Secondly - this material can be considered as a kind of master classes.  I will not be greedy and hide from the reader the tricks of development, the train of thought and the tools used.  I would even be interested to share all this in order to listen to comments, persuasion and advice :) <br><br>  What exactly are we talking about?  Particularly observant, drew attention to the tags to the record, but if you did not get into the number, here is a brief overview of the technologies: <br><ul><li>  the core of the application will be based on ZendFramework and Doctrine. </li><li>  client part will be implemented based on Mootools </li><li>  the initial design will be on paper, in a word processor and in the BOUML program (I don‚Äôt know if it is under Win) </li><li>  ... and there will be a lot of additional libraries and software that I will use and which will be discussed in this series of articles :) </li><li>  and there will be svn access for everyone and trac </li></ul><br><br>  So, I described the technical component.  And what exactly am I going to develop?  In general, there is nothing that could be called an innovation :) There are a great many analogs of the product, but for me the main process is not the result.  I hope that for you as well :) <br>  We will do (yes, without your help and support, I will load and give up all this scribbling 8-)) analogue of KMyMoney or <a href="http://homemoney.com.ua/">homemoney.com.ua</a> - who is more familiar with :) But it will be not just an analogue, but a product that personally I'm going to use in everyday life, and therefore it should turn out to be more convenient, more interesting and more flexible. <br>  As I have already said, home budgeting systems are great, but it is on the basis of such a product that you can hone skills in many areas of web development, as there is a place for different patterns and for sharing access rights for both internationalization and caching systems, but while the project is not large and resources will not require much.
