In the subway - the same picture.  Already, the whole Generation Y has grown, people from 17 to 35 years old who cannot imagine communicating with friends without digital communications (chat rooms, social networks) and prefer this method of communication to telephone calls. <br><br>  It is logical that this generation as a customer expects the opportunity to communicate with companies in the usual style.  And many organizations in their contact centers introduce solutions for communication with customers, for example, using chat.  But, as research shows, digital communication channels are poorly integrated with the main platform of the contact center, are less well monitored and serve mainly for primitive reference and information services.  That is, the introduction is made on the principle of "that was."  On the other hand, the contact center industry has been discussing the omni channel concept for quite a long time, which aims to eliminate inequalities in service processes via voice and text (digital) channels.

With the advent of IP technology, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcontact centers was implemented on the principles of IP telephony.  IP is characterized by the fact that voice, video, data are transmitted over the same protocol.  And in KC, it became possible to use the same operators to process calls through different channels: calls, e-mail, chats.  Video contact centers are not widely used, however, such a technological opportunity also appeared.  ‚ÄúCall‚Äù turned into a ‚Äúcontact‚Äù center and became multichannel. <br><br>  Omnichannel originated in the continuation of the development of multi-channel.  The main basis of the concept of ‚Äúomni channel‚Äù as applied to contact centers, as compared to multichannel service, can be formulated as follows: <b>‚Äúomni‚Äù is multichannel + context</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7e9/d18/42c/7e9d1842ce4c44128d53750f5b8cb3eb.jpg"><br><br>  More broadly, omni is based on the following postulates: <br><br><ol><li>  Opportunity for the client to get access to all services of the contact center, regardless of the channel contacting CC.  That is, the client can conduct any operation either via a call to the CC, or via chat, e-mail or other convenient channel to communicate with the company. <br><br></li><li>  The KC and the company as a whole should support the possibility of transferring the context of the client's request when communicating with the company via various access channels.  A single database should be organized on the client‚Äôs call history.  How did these appeals end and ended? <br><br></li><li>  The client must be able to go from channel to channel without losing the context of a specific appeal.  Example: a client in the personal account on the site begins to arrange the service (for example, fills out a loan application form).  Then, without completing the questionnaire, he can stop and leave the site to continue working on the questionnaire through a mobile application or chat.  And the process can end by ordering a callback so that the client can get an answer to any of his questions. </li></ol><br>  <b>Who needs the omni channel and why?</b> <br><br>  The importance of omnicanality in the service process is difficult to underestimate: having information about customer behavior, one can foresee his actions.  Thus, a loyal customer base is formed. <br><br>  By monitoring messages in social networks and comparing it with the existing context database of customers, you can effectively suppress negative moods.  What distinguishes the Russian consumer?  In case of dissatisfaction, he will simply leave, will not inform the company that there were problems.  By implementing omnichannel business processes, such situations can be monitored and incorporated into customer retention strategies or adjustments to current business service processes, identifying system problems. <br><br>  And for the client it is important that they recognize him, possess information about his preferences and can offer something useful.  When in the process of ordering it goes from channel to channel, it does not need to duplicate information, and this is a big time saving.  The operator already knows why the client turned to him.  All this increases the quality of service and the convenience of the client communicating with the company, and hence loyalty.  The usefulness of high-volume customers is indisputable for any company. <br><br>  <b>How to implement the concept of omni-channel without technology?</b> <br><br>  The implementation of the omnicanality concept requires certain technological solutions.  But this is only 20% of the concept.  80% - properly aligned business processes. <br><br>  Speaking at conferences on this topic, I ask the audience: <br><br>  - Who believes that the omni channel concept is implemented in their contact center? <br>  Hand, as a rule, no one raises. <br>  - And who is doing the SMS mailing? <br>  Hands up most. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7c5/cee/639/7c5cee639c5046eb8c32e176a65c9b8c.jpg"><br><br>  Suppose you send information to a client with a special offer.  In this case, the purpose of the mailing list is to generate a client's appeal to the company, to interest him, so that he will apply and make a purchase.  Suddenly, within 15 minutes, there are several calls to KC, to a standard company number from customers whose numbers coincide with the distribution.  It is very likely that the client, having received the information, decided to call.  And then - do you make such calls in the usual way?  "Hello, you called the company ..., select the menu item." <br><br>  Either you immediately catch this situation, without the incoming standard menu, transfer the client to a specific group of operators who specialize in a specific issue.  And at the same time, the operator displays on the screen information that the customer is calling, who were sent an SMS 15 minutes ago with the offer of service, such conditions, etc.  And the operator already meets him prepared.  This is a business process, sharpened to first send information to the client through one channel, receive a call, track the context (why he can contact us), immediately applied the appropriate method of processing such a request ‚Äî that is the <a href="http://www.cti.ru/ru/activities/news/omnichannel-is-a-key-trend-in-customer-service-cti/">omni channel</a> that meets almost all the criteria. <br><br>  I ask the hall: <br><br>  - Do you have this? <br><br>  Very few people raise their hands.  And to implement it is quite simple.  You already have a mailing list database.  In the routing system, when you receive a call, make a request - is it a call from this base?  From the point of view of technology to introduce nothing.  And omni channel is already working. <br><br>  To fully implement the concept of omnicanality, the implementation of the three points listed above is needed.  To do this, you already need a specialized database that stores the context of the message, and specialized solutions that allow you to receive at least the same level of service through chat as if you were on the phone. <br><br>  Omnichannel can begin to build in quietly, without introducing anything new.  So that companies understand that the omni channel is not a scary beast.  If you start to go in this direction, adjusting business processes, teaching yourself first of all, as a company, that you need to work with clients in this way, then further steps will be easier.  A tighter introduction of omnicanality provides for appropriate technologies, without which it is difficult to implement more complex cases than with SMS mailings. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br><br>  No one will leave omni channel.  Companies need to implement this concept today without any significant costs for new technologies.  We need to start with business processes and look for those pieces of this concept that can be implemented now.  Next - see what you can implement the next step.  Today, chat rooms have become the most popular channel of communication, we must begin with them. <br><br>  The main thing is to rebuild these processes, focusing on the fact that as a result, a fully functional omnichannel system will be implemented in the CC.  It is necessary to design with a margin, so that immediately there is a base for storing the context.  It is important that the next step does not stumble upon the fact that from a technological point of view everything that was done before must be broken and redone. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/321788/">https://habr.com/ru/post/321788/</a></p>
