While traditional systems are fading into the background, migrating mission-critical applications to cloud infrastructure is becoming ubiquitous.  IDC confirms this trend and predicts that the cloud software market will exceed $ 112 billion by 2019.  What does all this mean for the future of cloud technology?

      Below are five forecasts that we believe will come true during 2016. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Forecast number 1: fashion for SaaS </h1><br>  Faced with the need to choose between replacing outdated equipment or moving to a software vendor, companies more often choose the second option.  Working with traditional suppliers has become too difficult for companies, which makes them turn to SaaS.  Fears of SaaS have disappeared and companies are considering the possibility of solving more and more problems with this model. <br><br>  Despite the fact that many marketing, personnel and sales departments have already switched to SaaS, IT departments are not in a hurry to do the same.  However, in 2016, a significant number of IT departments will switch to SaaS, and not just assist other departments in this transition. <br><br>  Many consider IT as a service and large companies have implemented a ‚Äúon demand‚Äù software delivery model in their structure, but now other companies are adopting this structure.  For many companies, disaster recovery will be the first stage of the transition to the ‚Äúon demand‚Äù software model, since most companies will not want to invest in the amount necessary for an acceptable level of disaster recovery, but will attract DraaS providers to service this segment. <br><br><h1>  Forecast 2: Changes in the service area of ‚Äã‚Äãdata centers </h1><br>  It would seem that there is no point in supporting the data center after transferring the main applications to SaaS.  However, many important applications that are not yet translated to SaaS require maintenance.  Companies could hire providers that specialize in supporting the sustainability of programs to manage such applications. <br><br>  At this stage, providers such as Bluelock can begin to host and protect applications, while IT (or software vendor) will upgrade them to further transition to SaaS. <br><br><h1>  Prediction 3: New degree of responsibility for ensuring smooth operation </h1><br>  We have already observed cases of dismissal of IT managers for data leakage, but now they will also be responsible for system downtime and interruptions.  Until now, corporate applications have not been at the center of public attention, but social networks will soon begin to reveal problems in this area and bring IT professionals to justice. <br><br>  For example, if the plane does not take off on schedule, passengers often complain about the airline on social networks.  Similarly, if a customer brings a car for servicing to a salon, and the necessary spare part is not yet available, he will probably let off steam in the network.  These are just a few examples of how social networks draw attention to the interdependence between applications and the operation of the most important business operations.  All companies strive to ensure the smooth operation of their services to maintain a high level of customer satisfaction and their competitiveness, and the burden of this task will fall on IT managers. <br><br><h1>  Forecast 4: Choosing between in-house problem solving and outsourcing </h1><br>  Should I hire my own expert or engage a service provider to solve the necessary problem?  Today, an increasing number of companies are choosing the second option, since  attracting and retaining IT professionals continues to cause difficulties for most companies and they are forced to direct them to work on innovative and strategic projects, and not to solve less interesting, but important for business tasks, such as disaster recovery. <br><br>  Companies recognize that disaster recovery requires a lot of experience, time and money, and therefore this task will become the main candidate for outsourcing in 2016. <br><br><h1>  Forecast 5. In conditions of increased production security, attackers will increase the number of attacks on the accompanying non-production backup data storage systems </h1><br>  In military affairs, flanking is used when attacking to assess the weak sides of the enemy‚Äôs defense.  A less common scenario in which an attack on a seemingly indirect goal has the same effect as an attack on a main target.  In the digital age, this is possible.  Digital assets, such as personal information, loan information, or trade secrets, unlike physical assets like gold, cash, or ammunition, can be, and in most cases are, in several places at the same time. <br><br>  Historically, the data of the second and third importance were stored on the outdated equipment of the enterprise without any meaningful binding to the network.  As cloud storage utilization increases, and disaster recovery and state-of-the-art health maintenance methods keep a site in a state of constant activity to reduce recovery time and prevent data loss, sites become great targets for intruders. <br><br>  Modern technologies, including virtualization, continuous replication, cloud storage services like DraaS, as well as storage services (such as AmazonGlacier), put once protected data (for example, autonomous data, stored data, and difficult to install data) into constantly active and less protected environment compared with the environment in which the data related to the production. <br><br>  It‚Äôs simpler, but perhaps more expensive, to set the same standards for protection, investment and maintenance of backup data as for production data. <br><br>  Most companies will not care if the data leak occurred due to the failure or hacking of the internal security systems or, as in this case, because of the transfer of the data storage location.  Data leakage is a data leakage and, as we learned from bitter experience, the consequences can be significant. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/276095/">https://habr.com/ru/post/276095/</a></p>
