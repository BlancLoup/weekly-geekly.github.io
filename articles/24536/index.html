For those who did not know about it, or knew, but the reluctance was to understand. <br><br>  What for?  For personal purposes, so that it is not a shame to print any ‚Äúvasya-p1982-2@bk.ru‚Äù on a business card.  For organizations, too, is useful.  In the company I worked for, the entire staff on the hosting was only 200 megabytes of mail space.  This was, of course, not enough, and the sysadmin went and barked at the staff, reducing the total amount of positive in the universe, which is absolutely unacceptable :)

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  1. Register on <a href="http://webmoney.ru/">webmoney.ru</a> .  Webmoney - this is probably the most hemorrhoidal stage.  Be patient.  I advise you to choose the version of Webmoney Light - work through the browser.  And authorization through the X.509 certificate.  Save this certificate somewhere in a super secure place. <br><br>  2. <a href="http://light.webmoney.ru/">Go</a> to <a href="http://light.webmoney.ru/">light.webmoney.ru</a> , log in and create a ruble wallet. <br><br>  3. Go to <a href="http://www.webmoney.ru/rus/about/demo/help/common/autorisation_r_purse.shtml">www.webmoney.ru/rus/about/demo/help/common/autorisation_r_purse.shtml</a> - it says how to get a formal certificate (for this you will need to enter your real passport data) and authorize the wallet.  It only takes a couple of minutes.  Write down the number of the ruble wallet. <br><br>  4. Only after this, go to the nearest supermarket, find a machine for receiving money.  Choose something like Internet money -&gt; Webmoney.  Enter the number of your ruble wallet.  You will need about 410 rubles, but the machine itself takes a commission (usually from 3% to 10%), so insert 430-450 rubles.  Keep a receipt just in case.  For example, in case you still have not authorized the wallet - the money will not reach. <br><br>  5. Check that the money has come.  Come on <a href="http://domains.webmoney.ru/">domains.webmoney.ru</a> .  As far as I know, there the domain registration in the .ru zone is the cheapest of all: 110 rubles versus 150-600 for the rest.  Register the domain you like.  At the end you will need to put a tick "Use DNS servers registrar." <br><br>  6. At the same <a href="http://domains.webmoney.ru/">domains.webmoney.ru,</a> go to ‚ÄúMy Domains‚Äù -&gt; Order Hosting.  Choose the cheapest rate - 30 rubles per month.  Order hosting for 12 months.  It will cost 296 rubles - 15% discount when paying via Webmoney.  Buying hosting, in general, is not necessary, but useful, because surely someone who knows your email I@domain.ru will climb to look at what is located on domain.ru. <br><br>  7. Now have to wait a bit.  In my case - about half a day.  Why?  If you do not go into details, the domain registration itself takes only a few minutes, but it will take some time to notify the entire Internet that your site has come into being. <br><br>  8. When your website finally starts to open, go to <a href="http://www.google.com/a/help/intl/en/business/applications.html">www.google.com/a/help/intl/en/business/applications.html</a> and register there (the blue button on the right).  Select the free standard option - Free.  For money, you can buy more space for mail and various additional functions. <br><br>  9. Get further into the wilds of registration.  Choose a variant using an existing domain (we have been registering it all this time) ‚ÄúI want to use an existing domainname‚Äù.  Introduce yourself as a domain administrator. <br><br>  10. After you fill out all the data, you will need to prove that the domain belongs to you.  Select the file download as proof.  Create a googlehostedservice.html file, write code to it that Google asks, and upload this file via FTP to your newborn site in the httpdocs directory (this is the root of the site).  Data for access to your site via FTP came to you in a letter when you ordered hosting.  If you did not order hosting at all, then the only way is to choose a proof through the CNAME record.  Google will tell you what and where you need to enter, you will only need to go to the domains.webmoney.ru -&gt; My domains -&gt; Domain management -&gt; Zone management and make the appropriate CNAME record. <br><br>  11. Do not lose the spirit.  Just a little bit left to wade through endless forms.  Enter in your browser the address: your <a href="http://xn--80aae4a1bi2b.ru/">website.ru</a> : 8443 / - this is the hosting control panel of your site.  Follow the white rabbit: Homepage -&gt; at the bottom click on your domain name -&gt; DNS Settings.  Find one entry in the list whose type is MX, and delete it.  Now we will enter addresses of Google e-mail servers.  Click "Add Record" and create entries with the following parameters: <br><br>  Type of all records - MX <br>  Mail Domain - Leave Empty <br>  Mail server and mail server priority - create entries for each server from this list: <br><br>  ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM.  - priority 10 <br>  ALT1.ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM.  - 20 <br>  ALT2.ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM.  - 20 <br>  ASPMX2.GOOGLEMAIL.COM.  - thirty <br>  ASPMX3.GOOGLEMAIL.COM.  - thirty <br>  ASPMX4.GOOGLEMAIL.COM.  - thirty <br>  ASPMX5.GOOGLEMAIL.COM.  - thirty <br><br>  12. Now back to google.  Go to <a href="http://google.com/a/">google.com/a</a> -&gt; Login -&gt; Go to the control panel -&gt; At the top right, the link ‚ÄúManage this domain‚Äù (domain management) -&gt; Email -&gt; Enable.  Google will first check the correctness of the MX records that we created in the previous step, and then it will tell our servers for about an hour that a new cool website has appeared on the Internet and it would be nice to receive its mail. <br><br>  13. At this time, you can create accounts (mailboxes) on the same page.  Up to a hundred pieces.  At this happy step we will stop.  You can also upload yourself a simple business card to the hosting when you are bored and wait until the long-awaited ‚ÄúActive‚Äù appears in the Google control panel next to the word Email. <br><br>  If you already have your own domain and even a working site on it, and even working mail from a hoster, it is still easier.  Follow steps 8-10 immediately.  Then find where your DNS / host settings change on your hoster / registrar and replace the existing MX records with Google's MX records (see step 11).  It is better to do this at night, because about an hour the mail will come the devil knows somewhere on Google, or on the old hoster's box.  Then everything is the same - we turn on the Email service, we create user accounts. <br><br>  If at some stage you get stuck - ask.  I hope that this article will make life easier for someone and help to make work with mail easier, more carefree and more beautiful. <br><br>  I, unfortunately <sup>:)</sup> , have nothing to do with Google or domains.webmoney.ru and local hosting, but just shared my experience.  Registrar and hoster can be any. <br><br>  PS Habrachelovek Dreadatour in the comments gave the link: <a href="http://www.google.com/support/a/bin/answer.py%3Fanswer%3D60227%26hlrm%3Den">www.google.com/support/a/bin/answer.py?answer=60227&amp;hlrm=en</a> - how to make it so that you can use Google Talk on your domain. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/24536/">https://habr.com/ru/post/24536/</a></p>
