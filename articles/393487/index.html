Bachelor.  You did not have a situation when all clean socks ran out and after half an hour you need to leave the house?  I had a little sneaky a couple of times, I had to wash my socks in the sink with soap and dry them with a hairdryer.  In principle, it effectively dries; only the mother at the time was cursing something.  :) <br><br>  And now, after many years, now with a hairdryer you can dry not only socks, but also a shirt, pants, and even shoes, quite officially.  This is what I like about progress, because it is what you sometimes think, and if there was such a device, I would use it, but it is already there, ready. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f5d/796/207/f5d79620730c4a00b04114d095cd1094.jpg">

      In general, I present to your attention a turbo-dryer. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Turbo dryer comes here in such a nice craft box. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/50f/b71/4e6/50fb714e6a4c45e59b81459ad266b8ae.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cf2/57e/a4c/cf257ea4cbb84fd6b1201c5e6b26fb23.jpg"><br><br>  The box shows a schematic of the dadget itself and a small description of what it is and why. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7c2/537/a38/7c2537a387474576aad82ee4fa1a7415.jpg"><br><br>  Inside the box is a turbo dryer with a set of nozzles in a soft velvet pouch with a pull + instruction. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fb4/90d/330/fb490d33069d4098a62ebceff8d17357.jpg"><br><br>  Nozzles 2 types + hooks for trousers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f5d/796/207/f5d79620730c4a00b04114d095cd1094.jpg"><br><br>  Turbosushilka with main nozzles distantly resembles the aircraft.  It is clear, because turbo dryer.  Everything has to do quickly. <br>  There are several uses here.  You can either use it as a hanger and wearing a shirt on top, make it dry.  Either with the help of turbo dryers dry wet shoes after washing or in winter after walking.  In addition, there are hooks for trousers that can be placed inside the shirt when using a turbo dryer in the first scenario. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d19/77e/098/d1977e0987fa427285208d66ed9df57d.jpg"><br><br>  This is what a turbo dryer with shoe nozzles looks like. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/58a/2df/952/58a2df9520cc4006abf7fc39f1fd7a6e.jpg"><br><br>  Nozzles are made on flexible hoses with a spring inside, so that they keep the desired shape and can be extended if you need to dry, for example boots. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1f1/b40/b3e/1f1b40b3e27449e3b5dd0e406e3791c7.jpg"><br><br>  My boots are already far away in the closet, so as an example, I will show you how it looks with boots. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4ff/cab/ac4/4ffcabac487241d7a2207d27589f4996.jpg"><br><br>  When using the nozzle for shoes, the central hole from the bottom is closed with a silicone plug, so that the warm air does not go in vain, but goes into the pipes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/465/6ae/b86/4656aeb867e440109ecc29c45a179434.jpg"><br><br>  And this is already dried shirt after washing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/32a/3a5/17a/32a3a517aa8444b982ff659bb4e38e88.jpg"><br><br>  It is very simple to use a turbo dryer.  There is only one button.  then she does all the work herself, the main thing is to place everything correctly so that the barrel is inside. <br><br>  When you turn on the turbo dryer, the bezel around the button lights up in blue.  When you press the button, the glow changes to red and the heating is turned on.  After 3 hours, the heating is turned off and the turbo dryer just blows cold air.  In principle, 3 hours is enough to dry the shirt.  I have it dried already after 1.5 hours.  it all depends on the ambient temperature.  After all, as you know, the moisture evaporates from the heated material tends to cool objects and condenses there.  In general, if your home is cool, as it is now, when the heating is turned off, and the street is still not warm enough, then the turbo dryer will dry very efficiently, unlike traditional drying on a string. <br><br>  Now a little insider information. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1c4/636/b64/1c4636b6415c4cab8d4b264fd7a1cd0f.jpg"><br><br>  To look inside, you need to unscrew 4 screws. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2b6/f55/615/2b6f556154ab4b8c8d11bdd64fca135d.jpg"><br><br>  Then slightly prying to detach 2 white front panels, they are mounted on 2 latches on top. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e2b/1dc/1f6/e2b1dc1f66e4469e82feb8d28560eaf3.jpg"><br><br>  This is a front view.  There is a regular button and 2 SMD LEDs.  The case of the button inside the button is covered with foil so that the bezel is lit and not the button as a whole. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/80e/319/bf3/80e319bf36df4c86998a7748cf3cfdbb.jpg"><br><br>  Inside there is a fairly solid fan, albeit a small one.  I wanted to buy one on aliexpress, but the seller didn‚Äôt send the lot and it was canceled.  One such fan costs about 800 rubles there.  I was going to make a manual cyclone vacuum cleaner using a 3D printer.  The model is on Thingiverse ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/999/f90/fbb/999f90fbb20e495f942d2de5f935abbf.jpg"><br><br>  In the depths of the turbo-dryer, there is a thermal switch in a silicone wrap leaning against the heating element. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cec/c86/63f/cecc8663fcce437bb6882364649e19b5.jpg"><br><br>  This is the heating element itself.  The wires are all insulated and sheathed to withstand sufficiently high temperatures.  In principle, everything is collected soundly and you can not worry about safety, although in any case you should not leave heating appliances unattended. <br><br>  In conclusion, I would say that a turbo dryer is quite an interesting dadjet and can save time when drying things, when they may be needed quickly enough, but you should not forget that things still need to be ironed, which means it is not always advisable to completely dry out if it is not a shirt  Ideal turbo dryer is suitable for drying shoes, as after washing, and winter with fur inside.  As a rule, shoes dry for a long time and just inside it does not dry out well enough, which is why it spoils easily. <br>  Well, as a bonus for bachelors, you can easily and quickly dry socks with the help of turbo dryers :) <br><br>  You can purchase this djad via the link: <a href="https://dadget.ru/katalog/dom-i-dacha/turbosushilka/%3Futm_referrer%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_term%3Dturbosushilka%26utm_content%3Dturbosushilka%26utm_campaign%3Dturbosushilka_190">turbosushilka</a> .
