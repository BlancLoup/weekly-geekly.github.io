  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A game without a player. Zero player game</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This topic was written for the Sandbox.  Having received an invite, the topic was removed, and from the very beginning I wanted to share this review with the public, so I post it for those who do not go to the Sandbox and, to some extent, for themselves.  If this is not accepted, remove.  So‚Ä¶ <br><br>  I want to draw your attention to the so-called, "Zero Player Game" (ZPG).  These are games in which participation of the person in game process is not required.  That is, a person participates only in the creation of a character, and then cannot influence the gameplay in any way, with a few exceptions. <br>  Why do we need such games?  Everyone gives the answer for himself.  Some like to just watch the development of the character, others, in this way, want to join the universe of multiplayer games, the third just do not have enough time for "normal".  In this article I want to consider the most popular projects. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>1. Russian project "Godville"</b> .  <a href="http://godville.net/">http://godville.net</a> <br>  Browser text game written with great humor.  The user is represented by a god who is following the character created by him.  The hero keeps a diary in which he describes all his actions.  When creating a hero, you can set his name and gender.  Then he acts himself. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/1f/6b/1f6be75450dddf814b693b8718cfb996.jpg" alt="image"><br>  From time to time, you can say something to the hero, and you can also ‚Äúdo well‚Äù or ‚Äúdo badly‚Äù.  Depending on these actions, the hero will be more aggressive or more ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù.  As the level increases, he will have the opportunity to choose his motto and send him to rent to fight other heroes.  All the phrases you said to the ward are randomly transmitted to other players and they evaluate whether they are worthy of ‚Äúentering the annals of history.‚Äù  The text of the diary itself is replete with references to famous works and memes, that it is very interesting for a person who understands what he is talking about to read and be glad for the creators. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/8b/d6/8bd69584b0f113cab342c9fba72f2316.jpg" alt="image"><br>  There is an ‚Äúencyclobogy‚Äù in which at the moment there are about 1000 articles describing the world of Godville. <br>  The game is slightly monetized, but nothing prevents you from simply ignoring this item. <br><br>  <b>2.Progress Quest.</b>  <a href="http://www.progressquest.com/">http://www.progressquest.com/</a> <br>  It is considered to be the ancestor of this type of games and has existed in one form or another since 2002. For the game, you need to download a client in 320 KB under Windows or Ubuntu.  Under linux it is installed using wine.  When choosing a character, you will be randomly offered to choose a race (21 varieties) and a class (18 varieties).  The name can be both random and entered by you.  Then, again, everything happens only in text mode.  The game does not have the wit of a Russian-speaking fellow, therefore less interesting to watch.  You can play as a single and multiplayer.  For multiplayer you need an account.  The hero himself pumps his characteristics, gets new skills, develops the needs. <br>  Here is the main window of the game. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/6a/c3/6ac36b2cadc3673dabdda47fa8dabcff.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Who wants to watch the development of the character can follow the link.  <a href="http://progressquest.com/spoltog.php%3Fname%3DHabrahabra">http://progressquest.com/spoltog.php?name=Habrahabra</a>

      <b>3.My Brute.</b>  <a href="http://mybrute.com/">http://mybrute.com/</a> <br>  ZPG is a bit different.  This is Fighting.  You set the name of your hero, and that's all you can influence.  It is interesting to see how the character's appearance changes as you type.  If you do not like the final version, you can press a special button and select an acceptable appearance.  After creating a character, send him to the arena and enjoy an animated battle.  The experience goes both for won and lost fights. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/b9/5a/b95a833506c7bd49d6e6b1c6d9426058.jpg" alt="image"><br>  When you receive a level from a character (Brut) there is a chance of acquiring some skill (skill), either a weapon, or an increase in one of the characteristics.  Sometimes when the level rises, Brut has a pet that fights with you in the arena.  Also, the hero gets a certain amount of experience when his ‚Äústudent‚Äù - the referral gets a leveler.  The fight of highlevels with the participation of animals can be viewed here.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D6gUy95O9WBA">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gUy95O9WBA</a> <br>  The site hosts tournaments and team battles.  At the moment, a day can hold no more than 6 fights per day.  The downside of the game is the need to go to the site and press the "Fight" button, as well as the existence of many not quite honest ways of leveling the character, which sometimes repels beginners. <br><br>  Wikipedia says such games are used to practice ‚Äúgenetic programming‚Äù to develop countermeasure and survival algorithms through natural selection.  However, nothing prevents us from lying back in our chair and relaxing, feeling like a demigod watching the actions of your ward. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/96117/">https://habr.com/ru/post/96117/</a></p>
