Software products under this brand even in the list of official decisions are often similar to each other in the list of functions and name.  But there is also a configuration industry, a variety of solutions from partner companies.  All this brings a certain confusion, and makes the choice far from obvious to the user. <br><br>  For us, the implementation of software solutions from 1C is not the main focus of work; rather, work with this accounting system can be called a related service.  But all the same questions associated with the choice of a new program, there are many, they are repeated often.  And therefore we have developed a certain ‚Äúset of rules for choice‚Äù, which I want to tell about in this article. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I hope that our version of the universal answer to the clients' question about choosing and purchasing the 1C program will help not only our clients, but also other users.  Also, I will be glad to clarify and supplement the programmers who work with this software.  I think that an article with a list of advice for users will help save your time, while businessmen and / or specialists will receive answers to all important questions for them.

      For users who have not previously encountered work in 1C, I recommend to get acquainted first with the articles ‚Äú <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/trinion/blog/250893/">What is 1C</a> ‚Äù and ‚Äú <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/trinion/blog/315538/">What is Bitrix</a> ‚Äù, as well as ‚Äú <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/trinion/blog/289594/">1C Franchising</a> ‚Äù.  From them you will learn about the basic principles of the family of software solutions 1C, get acquainted with the advantages and disadvantages of these software products, get a basic knowledge about 1C.  In this article I will not repeat myself and talk about what kind of software products, and immediately move on to the questions of choosing a system. <br><br>  In principle, the approximate cost of buying 1C can be calculated on the 1C website, they have an [online calculator] (http://partweb.1c.ru/partnersupport/calc.aspx).  But there are not all configurations in it, moreover, it does not take into account additional associated costs.  But still pre-ask it also allows. <br><br><h2>  Platform and configuration: what do you buy? </h2><br>  All 1C software products consist of two parts - a platform (the foundation on which the software solution runs) and a configuration (a turnkey solution for work).  It is important to understand that without a platform no configuration can work.  A platform without configuration can only be useful for 1C programmers to create some kind of system from scratch.  Sometimes this option is also necessary in the case of extremely specific requirements.  But in this case, the user usually turns to a specialist and orders the development of a solution, and therefore there are no questions. <br><br>  When buying a ready-made ‚Äúboxed solution‚Äù, you purchase a platform together with the selected configuration. <br><br>  Usually the purchase consists of the following components: <br><br><ol><li>  Configuration 1C (Trade Management, Manufacturing Enterprise Management, etc.); </li><li>  Platform: SQL-solution or file; </li><li>  Database for network solution: Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, IBM DB2, Oracle Database.  A detailed description of 1C compatibility with databases is available here; </li><li>  Equipment that may be required for work. </li></ol><br>  It is important in the selection process to follow the sequence described above.  First, the configuration, then the platform, the databases for it, and only after that the available capacities are assessed and the necessary equipment is purchased. <br><br><h3>  Configuration selection </h3><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1q/fu/wn/1qfuwnrycj02zdk4w_j3kdjzxfw.png" alt="Configuration selection"></div>  Configuration is a ready-made software solution that users will work with.  Configurations are divided into industry and typical.  It is important for the buyer to understand the difference between these solutions. <br><br>  Typical configurations are solutions created by 1C software developers.  In the process of working on a typical configuration, the programmers tried to take into account a variety of work options and business needs.  As a result, solutions are cumbersome, they often contain a lot of unnecessary, while some necessary functions will still have to be improved by the specialists in implementing 1C.  But in this case, you buy a ready-made ‚Äúbox‚Äù with a platform and configuration, pay its cost plus a license for the number of jobs.  Nothing more is needed, of course, except for the introduction of a software product and possible modifications ‚Äúfor you‚Äù. <br><br>  Industry solutions are created by developers who are 1C partners on the basis of standard solutions.  At the same time, they more accurately adapt the configuration to the needs of enterprises of a certain industry, remove obviously unnecessary features and supplement them with documents and reports that are missing in the basic (standard) version.  It is quite possible that when choosing an industry solution, you will not need any system modifications during the implementation process or they will be minimal, which will speed up and significantly reduce the cost of implementation. <br><br><blockquote>  In most cases, in addition to paying for the cost of an industry solution and buying custom solutions, you will need to separately purchase a license for the 1C platform, which significantly increases the total cost of the product. </blockquote><br><br>  Developers of industry solutions usually indicate their price on the websites and only mention in the text about the need to purchase a platform.  As a result, when placing an order, buyers often do not take into account additional costs.  Therefore, I pay special attention to this moment. <br><br><h3>  Platform Selection </h3><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9g/bw/8v/9gbw8vew4zo06rfiaytwl5djima.png" alt="Platform Selection"></div><br>  The 1C platform is the foundation necessary for the operation of any configuration.  By default, a platform is provided for installation on a computer with file access to the data, i.e.  All information is stored on the main computer in service files.  Access to them is provided to all users. <br><br>  With a small number of users (for example, in the office up to 5 people), the speed of work will be quite satisfactory.  If the number of simultaneous access to the database files will increase, the user experience will drop dramatically.  For this reason, server solutions are usually chosen.  It may also require a separate server and a license for it to organize work in 1C from mobile devices. <br><br>  When choosing a platform for users, it is important to understand that 1C sells licenses according to the following principle: <br><br><ol><li>  Basic set of delivery (license) - platform + typical configuration + license for 1 workplace. </li><li>  Each additional workplace requires the purchase of a separate license. </li><li>  The 1C server (in case of choosing the server technology) also requires a separate license.  Remember that for the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of these licenses are different from a technical point of view.  I recommend choosing a 64-bit solution, despite the fact that the license itself is more expensive.  The 32-bit version has limitations on the amount of RAM, and this is the speed and user comfort.  If earlier it was not critical, then with the development of technologies and the increasing resource consumption of software products, the limitation of 4 GB of RAM becomes very noticeable. </li></ol><br>  At the same time, ‚Äúpackages‚Äù are often sold for work: for example, a basic license plus 5 workstations or the purchase of a configuration, a server and 20 workstations with a common set.  These are marketing solutions, if you wish, you can always buy a base license separately, separately - jobs in the right quantity and pay for a server solution. <br><br><h3>  Key options for 1C </h3><br>  Any 1C license, regardless of its type, is provided as a ‚Äúkey‚Äù to the product.  At the same time, for example, user licenses (workplaces) remain relevant even in the case of updating the software product or changing the configuration.  It is also quite acceptable to transfer the ‚Äúkey‚Äù from the computer to the computer in case of a change of place of work.  But at the same time, the key will not work on two devices. <br><br>  License keys to 1C are divided into two types: <br><br><ul><li>  Electronic - a set of PIN codes that activate the program.  Provided on paper in a sealed envelope.  Depending on the type of license, in addition to the main code, which is used when you first install the program, 2 to 5 backup codes are also included in the case of a system reinstallation or replacement of equipment (workplace). </li><li>  Flash keys are special USB-drives on which the license keys for the program are written.  This solution is more expensive than an electronic key.  And in the case of its loss, unlike electronic replacement, you will have to pay separately.  But USB keys allow even without a network server to regularly change the workplace, the key will be activated when the media is connected, regardless of the equipment used.  For example, if an accountant works in the office and at home, the flash key will allow him to access the program under a single user license and continue working in a convenient mode. </li></ul><br>  I recommend in case of any doubts to buy an electronic key.  Even if you run out of backup codes, if necessary, you can always get and re-activate the license.  In the case of server technology, electronic licenses are calculated by the number of connected without taking into account the features of the equipment.  Namely, this option is now almost always chosen except for, perhaps, very small companies (3-5 jobs). <br><br>  Flash media is worth buying for access to older versions of 1C or in cases like those described in the example above, i.e.  when you yourself understand exactly why you need just such a version of the key and for what you overpay and agree to inconvenience in case of loss or damage of the ‚Äúflash drive‚Äù. <br><br><blockquote>  Important to know: When working on a remote server, for example, in the case of using a virtual hosting service, using a flash license is not possible. </blockquote><br><br><h3>  Additions to 1C </h3><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/me/gr/_v/megr_v5fm7s97xyqmwchenpik3u.png" alt="Additions to 1C"></div><br>  When buying any configuration, so-called additions may also be required.  In most cases, these are different connectors to other systems.  For example, the addition of "1C Softphone" is necessary to connect IP-telephony from Softphone to 1C.  To use such additions, a separate license is also required, i.e.  additional charges. <br><br>  I wrote more about the use of add-ons in the article ‚Äú <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/trinion/blog/296406/">1C CRM.</a>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/trinion/blog/296406/">Review</a> . <br><br><h3>  Sample software procurement 1C </h3><br>  When choosing software solutions from 1C, it is important to understand that the cost of configuration, workstations, server and other features are summarized.  Therefore, when determining the budget for implementation, it‚Äôs worthwhile to focus not on individual prices indicated next to the type of configuration you need, but to carefully calculate all the licenses in general.  For this, you can, for example, take advantage of adding products to the shopping cart on the 1C website. <br><table><tbody><tr><th>  Name </th><th>  Price </th></tr><tr><td>  1C: CRM PROF.  Client license for 10 workplaces </td><td>  58 100 rub. </td></tr><tr><td>  1C: Enterprise 8. CRM PROF.  Electronic Delivery </td><td>  19 600 rub. </td></tr><tr><td>  1C: Enterprise 8. Client license for 10 workplaces </td><td>  41 400 rub. </td></tr><tr><td>  1C: Enterprise 8. Trade and Customer Relationship Management (CRM) </td><td>  25 960 rub. </td></tr><tr><td>  1C: Enterprise 8.2.  Server License (x86-64) </td><td>  86 400 rub. </td></tr><tr><td>  License for 10 users for 1C-Rarus: Softfon, Prof, edition 1 </td><td>  15 000 rub. </td></tr><tr><td>  TOTAL </td><td>  246 460 rub. </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  Let's say you are planning to use 1C for sales management.  Moreover, you are mainly interested in the CRM system, i.e.  automation and standardization of work with clients. <br>  So, the first thing you add to the cart.  this is 1C. CRM TRADE Enterprise. <br><br>  But separately 1C CRM PROF is hardly a complete solution for automation.  It is used in conjunction with the 1C configuration. Enterprise Trade and Customer Relationship Management (CRM).  There is one more line in our account. <br><br>  Further, for full-fledged fast user experience, you will need to organize the server part.  And for this purpose - the License for the server 1C. <br><br>  The next step - count the number of jobs.  Suppose there are 10 employees in your sales department.  We buy a license for 10 workplaces for 1C. Enterprise (for the configuration ‚ÄúTrade management‚Äù and access to the server).  And separately we acquire 10 jobs for the use of CRM PROF. <br><br>  And if you want to connect also telephony, which is almost always necessary when implementing CRM, then you also need user licenses to work with Softphone. <br><br>  After counting all the 1C components that will be included in the package, do not forget that if you use SQL, you will also need to pay for the database.  This amount in the ‚ÄúBasket 1C‚Äù is not counted. <br><br><blockquote> Important: In addition to all the above costs, you also need to pay a subscription to the ITS (information and technical support) from 1C.  Without this subscription you will not receive free software updates.  The cost of subscription depends on the selected configuration and other software.  Specify the amount from suppliers of software products when purchasing. </blockquote><br><h3>  Server software </h3><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nc/2f/af/nc2fafygwgix3-nkp6tfx3c1f5o.png" alt="Server software"></div><br>  To organize the operation of any server, special software is required, which is not included in the 1C package.  These software solutions can be free (open source license) or paid. <br><br>  The ability to install the 1C server on the open source software appeared relatively recently.  Therefore, when choosing this type of software, it can be difficult to find a competent specialist. <br><br>  The cost of commercial server solutions in each case will have to be requested from the developers separately.  It depends on your capacity and needs, while the base prices in public access are not laid out. <br><br>  The question of choosing server software for 1C is complex.  It is not possible to determine which of the options is more profitable and more convenient.  Therefore, it is worth remembering that additional expenses for server software may be required.  And ask the cost question from the selected specialist. <br><br><h3>  Equipment: required power </h3><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yg/sx/qy/ygsxqyocpyksj0wh-ajq8uat1aa.png" alt="Equipment"></div><br>  1C software systems are resource-intensive solutions, especially if a significant number of users from the office and remotely work with the configuration.  That is why it is important, in addition to selecting and purchasing the appropriate configuration, timely carrying out software updates and proper organization of the server operation, to monitor the used computer capacities and also to make timely equipment upgrades. <br><br>  When choosing a server version, you will need to pay for SQL (database server licenses).  It is produced regardless of the use of 1C, the SQL database is a separate paid software.  However, you can install a free analogue, having previously studied the pros and cons.  In any case, it is important to remember that paid software for working with databases is not included in the payment for 1C licenses. <br><br>  In the case of using the file type of information storage server and payment of SQL will not be required.  But even here it is extremely important to pay attention to computer capacities.  Perhaps when working with file storage organization it is even more important than when buying a server. <br><br>  Be sure to ask for help from qualified IT specialists (consultants, system administrators) who will determine how appropriate your equipment configuration is to use the software product, and what capacities should be increased or, which happens most often, will suggest you buy a new computer (server) for subsequent organization of effective work with software from 1C in multi-user mode. <br><br><blockquote>  Remember: even the best software will not be able to work effectively in the case of installation on outdated hardware with insufficient memory and low processing speed. </blockquote><br><h3>  Sample server equipment </h3><br>  Below is an example of a server configuration required for organizing multi-user work with 1C software products.  Prices and equipment are relevant for February 2018. <br><br><table><tbody><tr><th>  Device type </th><th>  ID </th><th width="300">  Name </th><th>  price, rub. </th></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">  CPU </td><td>  262010 </td><td>  Intel Core i5 7500T OEM </td><td rowspan="2">  13,900 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>  Socket 1151, 4 core, 2700 MHz, Turbo: 3300 MHz, Kaby LakeS, L2 cache 1 MB, L3 cache 6 MB, Intel HD Graphics 630, 14 nm, 35 W </td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">  Motherboard </td><td>  249054 </td><td>  Gigabyte GAQ270MD3H </td><td rowspan="2">  6,790 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>  Socket 1151, Intel Q270, 4xDDR4, 7.1CH, 1000 Mbps, USB3.1, DSub, DVI, HDMI, DisplayPort, mATX, Retail </td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">  Housing </td><td>  219054 </td><td>  Foxline FL516FZ450R Black 450W </td><td rowspan="2">  2,270 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>  mATX, MiniTower, 450 W, 2xUSB 2.0, Audio </td></tr><tr><td>  Cooling system </td><td>  203761 </td><td>  DeepCool GAMMAXX 200T </td><td>  970 </td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">  RAM </td><td>  204903 </td><td>  16Gb DDR4 2400MHz AMD (R7416G2400U2K) (2x8Gb KIT) </td><td rowspan="2">  12,760 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>  16384 MB, DDR4, 19200 Mb / s, CL15, 1.2 V </td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">  SSD Drive </td><td>  6985 </td><td>  250Gb SSD Samsung 960 EVO Series (MZV6E250BW) </td><td rowspan="2">  8,250 </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>  internal SSD, M.2, 250 GB, PCIE x4, read: 3200 MB / s, write: 1500 MB / s, TLC </td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">  TOTAL: </td><td>  44,940 </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  The motherboard and processor (4 cores are enough for even 30 users with 4 GB MSQL databases) selected because of the q270 chipset on which there is a vPro function that allows you to install the system and maintain the server remotely. <br><br>  Samsung's NVME drive surpasses similar HDDs in reading speed by 18 times and recordings by 9 times (excluding optimization of NVME drives for working with databases and other hardware improvements).  The solution also provides high performance for both the file version and for the MSSQL or PostgreSQL version of the program. <br><br>  16 GB RAM is enough for 10 users to work at the rate of 1GB per user + virtual memory on the NVME disk. <br><br>  When choosing a hardware solution and server configuration, use the professional help of specialists who can choose a solution for you taking into account the selected software products, the number of users and the expected load. <br><br>  An example of a complete set of the server part is given to help users assess their capabilities and pre-calculate the necessary budget. <br><br><h2>  Rent 1C: SAAS-solutions </h2><br>  Instead of the above-described purchase of numerous components, 1C offers an alternative solution - providing access to the 1C server ‚Äúin the clouds‚Äù.  The platform and the configuration you chose are already installed here.  Employees 1C monitor the quality of work, update the capacity and conduct server maintenance.  In this case, you can in the same way as in the case of the purchase of the 1C configuration, customize it to your needs, make some improvements, connect external reports, etc.  On the one hand, the solution is very attractive, and for a small company it is even financially beneficial. <br><br>  On the other hand, renting 1C also has its drawbacks and limitations: <br><br><ul><li>  An important limitation concerns access to the database and some service sections that may be required, for example, to integrate the ‚Äúcloud‚Äù 1C with the site.  In most cases, this issue can be resolved positively, since restrictions are imposed for the sole purpose of ensuring security.  But to resolve the issue will require a long correspondence and coordination of all technical issues with the staff of 1C. </li><li>  Since the system is located on remote "cloud" servers, all documents you need to first upload via the Internet to the server 1C, and only then you can attach them to a message or document.  In the case of a large volume of documents this may be inconvenient. </li><li>  All your information will be stored on servers of a third-party company.  Such an approach is often contrary to the company's security policy and trade secrets protection rules. </li><li>  For the above reasons, renting 1C is the best choice for small businesses.  For large companies, the SAAS solution is not suitable. </li></ul><br>  I strongly recommend that small and medium businesses carefully calculate the cost of renting 1C, for example, for a year.  At the same time pay attention to the technical limitations and determine.  Is this solution exactly right for you?  When choosing a tariff on the 1C rental page, you will be offered to use a convenient calculator.  It will help to compare the cost of renting and purchasing the program.  Perhaps when choosing a "cloud" solution to overpay, you will start in 6-8 months.  In this case, you will not receive ownership of the software solution, even when you pay the full cost of it. <br><br>  I am sure that every businessman is able to determine for himself which solution would be more profitable for him in terms of his business.  Most importantly, remember the pros and cons, which I listed above. <br><br><h2>  Briefly about the main thing: what is the cost of 1C </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pu/io/ir/puioir5m-rl8ksqqt2tmuaep6aw.png" align="left" width="300" alt="1C components">  So, what items of expenses are waiting for you if you implement 1C software solutions from scratch: <br><br><ul><li>  Base license for platform and / or typical configuration. </li><li>  Jobs by the number of employees. </li><li>  Server license and a separate SQL server (when choosing a server configuration with the appropriate technologies). </li><li>  Industry solution (separate configuration payment if necessary). </li><li>  Payment of additions to 1C (in case of integration with various software products). </li><li>  Purchase of server capacity (hardware). </li></ul><br>  You will also need expert assistance from 1C implementation specialists to install and configure all components, as well as, if necessary, refine the system to suit your needs.  In some cases, the introduction of 1C can be made without the involvement of specialists.  But usually it is the installation of the file version of the typical configuration and the setting up of several workplaces without any modifications, integration or server components.  In all other cases, specialists are needed, and therefore these costs should also be taken into account in the budget. <br><br>  Thus, when purchasing 1C, it is necessary to take into account the total cost of purchasing all the necessary software and equipment, its installation and configuration.  In addition, do not forget about the cost of ownership, which includes the cost of maintenance, installation of updates, staff training, etc. <br><div style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://trinion.org/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-x/wa/fp/-xwafph06imnlkkgjpvgmp9dguq.png"></a> </div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/349286/">https://habr.com/ru/post/349286/</a></p>
