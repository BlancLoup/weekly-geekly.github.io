  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Forward to the past: laptops of 2006 which we bought in Russia</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the case of mobile phones and smartphones, the form factor of <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/282536/">gadgets</a> has changed dramatically <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/282536/">since 2006</a> .  Now in the store it is difficult to find an expensive button phone, with the exception of "elite" devices with gold and diamonds, a slider or a cot.  Much more black rectangles of different sizes and with different logos. <br><br>  Laptops are more conservative - they still have buttons (except for Lenovo YogaBook), touch screens have been around for a long time, they also experimented with transformers for many years.  Let's remember the laptops of 2006 of that year, including devices from those manufacturers that have already tied up with personal computers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eff/d18/266/effd18266c1341b7913b19e974093496.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Lenovo ThinkPad X60 </h4><br>  In 2006, several ThinkPad notebooks came out.  Model X60 some consider one of the best in the history of the series.  This is a laptop-tablet, a transformer with a rotary touch screen. 
      <br>

      <br>
      ThinkPad X60 had a display with a diagonal of 12 "and a resolution of 1400x1050, 80 GB hard disk, RAM from 1 GB to 4 GB, Intel Core 2 Duo L7400 processor with a clock frequency of 1.5 GHz. And a durable case. The battery provided up to seven hours of work The laptop does not have a touchpad at all, only buttons and a trackpoint. It comes with a stylus for working with the screen. <br><br>  A laptop in Russia cost 2,500 US dollars.  At the rate of 27 rubles per dollar - the average for 2006 is 67,500 thousand rubles.  The average salary in Russia in 2006 was 10,634 rubles.  So, in order to buy a laptop, one had to save more than ten months, if not.  Obviously not for the average salary device. <br><br>  In 2016, the average salary is about 36,000 rubles, that is, a laptop would cost two average salaries in the country.  If you do not take into account inflation and changes in the dollar.  Taking into account inflation for this year, the laptop would have cost $ 3,050, and at the rate of 64 rubles (as of December 2016), its price would have been 195,000 rubles.  Total - about five and a half months of work on pasta with mayonnaise. <br><br>  For comparison: Lenovo X240 in 2016 costs about 110,000 rubles. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cyY8_JuqZbo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/544/d4a/0c7/544d4a0c7b806dd7d34398ac8dea8faa.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Apple MacBook Pro </h4><br>  In the same price category was an Apple MacBook Pro with a dual-core Intel Core Duo T2400 processor with a clock frequency of 1.8 GHz.  This is another professional laptop, the company's flagship with a 15.4-inch screen with a resolution of 1440x900 pixels, which was the first in the line to replace the PowerBook. <br><br>  It was possible to buy such a laptop in Russia for $ 2,400, that is, 64,800 rubles, or for six with a small salary.  In that year, the minimum wage (minimum wage) was set at 1,100 rubles.  Total - 58 minimum wages for a laptop. <br><br>  Taking into account inflation, the price would increase to $ 2,928.  This is 187,000 rubles, or more than five monthly wages on average in Russia.  Or 36 minimum wages, which this year amounts to 5,205 rubles. <br><br>  Today, a 15-inch MacBook Pro <a href="http://www.apple.com/ru/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/15-inch">costs from 190,000 rubles</a> .  More than five average salaries.  But now the processor is a quad-core Intel Core i7 with a clock frequency of 2.6 GHz, a 256 GB SSD and a Radeon Pro 450 video card with 2 GB of memory. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3ed/bcc/75d/3edbcc75da1149c88f4c3f64d1fba71f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  ASUS Lamborghini VX2 </h4><br>  Did you have an ASUS Lamborghini VX2 or did you just go and look at it in an electronics store?  It was a powerful gadget made by Asus in collaboration with automotive brand designers, second in the VX line.  The device worked on an Intel Core 2 Duo T7400 processor with a clock speed of 2.1 GHz and had an NVIDIA GeForce Go 7700 graphics card with 512 megabytes onboard, at that time the most powerful among notebooks.  The screen is 15.4-inch with a resolution of 1680x1050 pixels.  And the body, trimmed with leather.  This miracle weighs 2.8 kilograms. <br><br>  The laptop cost 3,500 US dollars, or 94,500 rubles.  Nine and a half salaries, almost 100 minimum wages.  Taking into account inflation, it would have cost 4,271 dollars.  At the rate for today such a stylish gadget would cost 273,000 rubles, or seven salaries.  These are 52 minimum wages. For comparison, today one of the most expensive gaming laptops ASUS G752VS-GB081T costs around 240,000 rubles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/170/33e/9e2/17033e9e2770a4ca47000647bac2d5f0.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c6f/97f/ef5/c6f97fef5fecbc69975c7b0b96e85bd7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Acer Ferrari 5005WLHi </h4><br>  Asus was not the only laptop company that collaborated in 2006 with a car brand.  Acer chose a Ferrari.  And again - a display of 15.4 inches and a diagonal with a resolution of 1680x1050, AMD Turion 64 X2 TL-60 dual-core processor with a frequency of 2 GHz.  The graphics card is not as powerful - 256-megabyte ATI Mobility Radeon X1600.  Devices heavy - 3 kilograms. <br><br>  And the price is about $ 3,700, or 100,000 rubles.  Ten salaries, one hundred minimum wages.  Today, its price would increase to $ 4,515, and taking into account the rate would be 288,967 rubles, or eight salaries.  Today, the most expensive gaming laptop from Acer Predator costs about 230,000 rubles. <br><br>  Acer in 2006 for the supply of laptops in pieces ranked third.  The company rose to the second, but at the end of 2015 remained in sixth place. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/122/146/a3e/122146a3e695dfb9cc33ff341ebfc6f5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/161/d55/ad3/161d55ad330db2218cdbb987b5cc35e9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  HP Compaq nx7400 </h4><br>  HP has never dropped below second place in the number of laptops sold in the past ten years, and ranked first from 2007 to 2012.  Therefore, with high probability you had a laptop from this manufacturer. <br><br>  HP Compaq nx7400 belonged to mid-range notebooks.  Depending on the processor, it cost from 650 to 1 350 dollars.  In the maximum configuration, he worked on a dual-core Intel Core 2 Duo T7200 with a frequency of 2 GHz, had 1 GB of RAM, expandable up to 4 GB, a hard disk of 120 gigabytes.  The screen device - 15.4 inches, with a resolution of 1280x800 pixels. <br><br>  By the design of the device, by its angular case, it is immediately clear that this is more of a corporate machine than a nice laptop for home use. <br><br>  The price of HP Compaq nx7400 in the maximum configuration was $ 1,350, or 36,450 rubles - three and a half salaries.  Today, it could cost $ 1,647, or 105,433 rubles.  For this money now you can buy a gaming laptop HP OMEN 17-w010ur with a Core i7-6700HQ processor with a frequency of 2.6 GHz, 16 GB of RAM, 128 GB SSD, 1 TB hard drive and a 17.3-inch screen with a resolution of 1920x1080 . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/199/4f7/3df/1994f73df99d62cdb5e72d170b201884.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Dell xps m1210 </h4><br>  The sales leader in 2006 was Dell.  One of its interesting notebooks was the 12-inch Dell XPS M1210, which had a discrete NVIDIA GeForce Go 7400 graphics card of 64 megabytes.  The screen of this miniature device is only 12.1 inches, weight is 1.98 kilograms.  The processor is an Intel Core Duo T2300E. <br><br>  The device cost $ 1,400, about 37,800 rubles, less than four wages.  With inflation, which turned its price into $ 1,708 by 2016, and with a course of 64 rubles, the laptop would have cost 109,338 rubles, or three salaries. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6cc/67b/d02/6cc67bd02aa7020e95cd8888c14bc1a6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Toshiba Qosmio F30 </h4><br>  The Toshiba Qosmio F30 has a truly futuristic, space design.  Just look at the silver volume control and speakers.  This device has a wide multimedia capabilities.  There is also a special Qosmio Player, which is located on the second hard drive and works without loading the operating system, a TV tuner and a DVD player. <br><br>  The screen device - 15.4 inches with a resolution of 1280x800.  The processor is a dual-core Intel Core Duo T2500 with a clock frequency of 2 GHz.  RAM - 1 GB, you can expand to 4 GB.  The hard disk is 100 gigabytes, but you can install a second disk in the additional compartment.  Responsible for the video is 256-megabyte NVIDIA GeForce Go 7600. <br><br>  But you have to pay for everything.  In this case - weight.  Qosmio F30 weighs 4.3 pounds.  Let me remind you, the display is only 15.4 inches. <br><br>  The laptop cost $ 1,600, or 43,200 rubles in 2006 ‚Äî four salaries.  Today, its price would be 1,952 dollars - 124,958 rubles.  These are three and a half salaries or twenty four minimum wages. <br><br>  And in 2014, Toshiba <a href="http://4pda.ru/2014/9/21/177235/">decided to discontinue the</a> production of laptops and personal computers, since this unit brought the least profit.  But until 2009, the company was among the five largest vendors in terms of the number of devices sold. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9f5/484/980/9f54849809030e22e95c83667bfe954d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Samsung R65 </h4><br>  The Samsung R65 was equipped with an Intel Core Duo T250 processor with a frequency of 2 GHz, 1 GB of RAM, expandable up to 4 GB, a 100 GB hard disk and an optical drive with DVD recording capability.  The screen of the device is with a diagonal of 15 inches and a resolution of 1400x1050 pixels. <br><br>  The laptop cost from 1 400 dollars.  This is 37,800 rubles for 2006, or almost four average salaries.  Taking into account inflation and the current rate today, its price would be 109,338 rubles, three average salaries for 2016. <br><br>  Samsung, like Toshiba, in 2014 <a href="http://www.3dnews.ru/901449">decided to</a> engage with laptops, although it continues to experiment with transformers and occasionally releases ultra-portable devices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/013/d71/aa6/013d71aa67c49981bce01c9ede41c854.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Fujitsu Siemens Amilo Pro V3515 </h4><br>  Fujitsu Siemens is the brand of laptops that some of you remember, but which you can't see in the stores anymore.  Like phones BenQ-Siemens.  This 2006 notebook had a 15.4-inch screen with a resolution of 1280x800 pixels, worked on an Intel Celeron M 430 processor with a frequency of 1.7 GHz, was equipped with from 256 to 512 megabytes of RAM and a 40-60 GB hard drive. <br><br>  It could be bought for $ 700, or for 18,900 rubles.  Budget, affordable machine.  If it were not for the processor that was too weak, there would be no price for it.  Today it could cost 854 dollars - 54,600 rubles, one and a half average salaries. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cf8/85b/af3/cf885baf3e269afd840794403be16a4a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  LG K1 </h4><br>  Another half-forgotten laptop brand is LG.  The company announced the discontinuation of notebook production in 2009.  In 2006, released the budget LG K1.  The processor is an Intel Celeron M 430 with a frequency of 1.7 GHz, a 15-inch screen 1024x768, a hard disk of 60 gigabytes and a RAM of 512 megabytes.  Externally, the model is very pretty. <br><br>  Price - $ 700, 18 900 rubles, as is the case with the previous notebook in the article.  Today it could cost 854 dollars - 54,600 rubles.  For this money, you can buy, for example, a 14-inch transformer Lenovo Yoga 500 with a 4-core AMD A6-7310 processor with a frequency of 2 GHz, 4 GB of RAM and a 128 GB SSD. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/01e/d19/b3f/01ed19b3fb82fe78e574e5485271ede9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Sony VAIO VGN-AR11SR </h4><br>  In 2006, the Sony VAIO VGN-AR11SR came out.  This is a 17-inch monster with a screen resolution of 1920x1200 pixels, an Intel Core Duo T2500 processor with a clock frequency of 2 GHz, a 256 MB NVIDIA GeForce Go 7600 GT graphics card, two 100 GB hard drives and a 1 GB RAM.  The laptop weighs 3.8 kilograms. <br><br>  An interesting feature of the laptop was a built-in drive for reading Blu-Ray discs. <br><br>  The price was appropriate - $ 2,400, or 64,800 in rubles at the 2006 exchange rate.  Six and a half average salaries in the country.  In 2016, a laptop would have cost $ 2,928, or 187,000 rubles.  These are five average salaries. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3ab/74b/592/3ab74b5923cc5ce01514a507fd40c562.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  RoverBook Voyager V700 </h4><br>  Another monster with a 17-inch screen from 2006 is the Voyager V700 from the Russian manufacturer RoverBook.  This is a huge, 4.3-pound notebook with a powerful Intel Core Duo T2600 dual-core processor, a 512 megabyte NVIDIA GeForce Go 7900 GS discrete graphics card, a gigabyte of RAM and a 100 gigabyte hard drive. <br><br>  The laptop has a TV tuner, and included a remote control. <br><br>  At that time, it was a very powerful gadget at a relatively low price for such characteristics - $ 2,000, or 54,000 rubles, five average salaries.  Today, it would have cost $ 2,440, which is 156,000 rubles 30 minimum wages or four and a half of the average salary. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5b6/6ff/126/5b66ff12697c22f761b6a8ad846cc70e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Today, prices for laptops with respect to the average salary remained almost the same.  And if you pay attention to the prices in dollars, then you can see that in the past ten years, little has changed.  If you really need a powerful machine - you will have to pay for her a half or two thousand American dollars.  Or look for a device with the most appropriate characteristics from the category of "budget".  Although this concept with current prices has become not quite normal. <br><br><h4>  What did you use in 2006?
