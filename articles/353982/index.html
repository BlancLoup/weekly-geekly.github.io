But even if you are not in Petersburg these days, you can still listen to many reports.  In addition to a paid online broadcast, which gives access to what is happening in all halls, we also do an open <a href="https://dotnext-piter.ru/online-free/">broadcast of the first hall that is</a> open to all. <br><br>  What reports are in open broadcast?  A complete list with descriptions - under the cut, and before it we note a couple of things.  According to the results of the two previous DotNext, <b>Dylan Beatty</b> turned out to be a clear spectator favorite, so he will open DotNext with a presentation on how the familiar technologies work.  And just yesterday, when the report was already fully prepared and agreed upon, Dylan discovered for himself the subtleties of the KOI8-R encoding and now he enthusiastically <a href="https://twitter.com/dylanbeattie/status/987371979475996672">redoes</a> part of the presentation!

This is a video with a cat falling from a chair!  You answer "LOL", put the phone back in your pocket ... But do you think what it took to make it all work?  Inside even the cheapest smartphone there are thousands of innovations, algorithms, inventions - but how do they work?  How were they developed?  What will the next generation of algorithms and applications look like? <br><br>  In this report, we will be able to immerse ourselves in the technologies by which our ordinary household items work, and we unearth algorithms and abstractions that create our new digital world.  We will look at everything: network addressing algorithms, frequencies in cellular networks, optimization of the shortest distance search, wavelet-compression, fingerprint recognition, media encoding methods, and so on.  After this report, you will no longer be able to relate to your mobile phone as before. <br><br clear="all"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0f2/5ed/cb0/0f25edcb07d033d5f11270b1696f6654.jpg" width="200" align="left">  <b>Dylan beatie</b> <br>  Dylan is a systems architect and developer who has been involved in many projects in his life, from small websites to huge distributed systems;  from Legacy with a twenty-year history to the latest developments.  He now works as an architect in Spotlight and is engaged in solving complex problems in modern distributed systems.  In parallel with the main work, Dylan is actively involved in the community, is the organizer of the London .NET User Group and in 2016 participated in many conferences, including Oredev in Sweden, NDC in London, Sydney and Oslo, Tampere Goes Agile in Finland and BuildStuff in Lithuania and Ukraine . <br><br clear="all"><hr><br><h2>  12:00 <a href="https://dotnext-piter.ru/2018/spb/talks/2qatbxw8hsucaikiosmoem/">Fastware</a> </h2><br>  Optimization - that is, code acceleration - is one of the main ingredients of modern computing technologies.  The speed of light is limited, so you can not overclock the frequency of the processors;  On the other hand, matter consists of individual atoms, therefore it is impossible to make the schemes smaller than they are made now.  So, for modern tasks such as self-managing machines or general artificial intelligence, methods of acceleration will have to be invented with our own brains. <br><br>  This paper talks about two new examples at different ends of the spectrum of optimization techniques.  The first technique is related to iron: you can replace brunches with calculations.  Modern processors work much better with sequential code than with unpredictable brunches, we will exploit this fact.  The second example will be about the classical algorithm, which can be improved using statistical data on the distribution and localization of data, and this improves its theoretical and practical performance. <br><br clear="all"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/755/6b2/de3/7556b2de3a254ee7a64f29b7a05574fb.jpg" width="200" align="left">  <b>Andrei Alexandrescu</b> <br>  Andrei Alexandrescu is an expert on a variety of things, including the design and implementation of software systems, the design of programming languages, libraries, all aspects of C ++ and D, machine learning and the processing of natural languages.

In this report, the containers are shown as they really are: normal processes, but with some amount of isolation, a quota for resources, and all this is sprinkled with sandboxing on top of security.  You will understand why containers are so interesting and useful, how neimspaces isolate containers from each other, how to fumble resources between containers, how throttling works, how it all relates to .NET runtime and how to write a minimal .NET Core application that won't drag with an unnecessary 500 megabytes of user-space libraries and utilities from Ubuntu. <br><br><br clear="all"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b74/d38/301/b74d3830150229dba2e3d6df65e9bab6.jpg" width="200" align="left">  <b>Sasha goldshtein</b> <br><br>  Sasha Goldstein - CTO at Sela Group, Regional Director and MVP at Microsoft, author of books at Pluralsight and O'Reilly, international consultant and trainer.

Books on MTS, MSDTC, J2EE gather dust in museums while programmers write cloud services in the fight against eventual consistent data repositories like Cassandra and Mongo.  For financial transactions, immortal SQL remains. <br><br>  The team working on the Orleans framework is no stranger to questioning generally accepted "truths."  She has already shown that, if properly applied, distributed objects can be successfully used to build efficient scalable applications, offering a convincing alternative to the Erlang / Akka approach to the model of actors. <br><br>  Support for scalable distributed transactions is one of the latest Orleans innovations, refuting popular misconceptions.  Sergey Bykov will talk about it, as well as other advanced functions of the framework. <br><br clear="all"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6e7/9d3/ae7/6e79d3ae7c81d1f371fc1554ea119fb8.jpg" width="200" align="left">  <b>Sergey Bykov</b> <br><br>  Sergey Bykov started the Orleans project at Microsoft Research and continues to lead its development in open source in the Xbox division.

The code is something living, and there is no documentation better than the code itself.  Therefore, we are starting to use a bunch of tools that allow us to manually check the code and fully understand what is happening with objects of a certain type, which parts of the code really need dependencies or which APIs are used in which parts of the code base.  This is the more complicated the more code came to us from third-party developers. <br><br>  The Roslyn platform gives us the opportunity to write tools to understand the source in terms of business rules, extract information from them that is sufficient to identify patterns of use and to apply security practices. <br><br>  The idea is to improve the quality of code analysis tools, independently creating such tools and analyzers for Visual Studio, which will take into account the features of the developed product. <br><br><br clear="all"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/83b/1b1/e75/83b1b1e75601c9709580e38d227076e5.jpg" width="200" align="left">  <b>Raffaele Rialdi</b> <br>  Raffaele Rialdi - Senior Software Architect, working including as a consultant, speaker and trainer.
