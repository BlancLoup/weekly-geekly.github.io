  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About MongoDB Online University</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Last fall, the official MongoDB newsletter found out about the existence of their <a href="https://university.mongodb.com/">university</a> with free online courses on the product.  I decided to take the opportunity to pump my knowledge and passed one of the courses.  In this article I will talk about how to study at MongoDB University. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  general information </h4><br>  A total of 8 courses are available: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1fe/818/dcc/1fe818dcc8594432ad6ea85a75270fa8.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Course level 10X - for beginners.  Personally, I began to learn with zero knowledge of MongoDB.  Training is conducted by sessions, i.e. it is not possible to start training on an arbitrary day.  The current session began on January 5th and will end on March 1st.  Course schedule is <a href="https://university.mongodb.com/courses/schedule">here</a> .  You can also register for the first (at least) week after the start.  The first week is usually light on the material and tasks.

      Teaching is in English.  Subtitles are present.  Each course lasts seven weeks.  At the end of each week - homework.  Monitoring their implementation.  Deadline is Tuesday, 17:00 UTC.  After this time, it is no longer possible to send answers to tasks.  There is a forum for the session / course with a curator from MongoDB for explaining assignments and solving problems. <br><br>  At the end of the course - the final test.  This final test has nothing to do with exams for a certified MongoDB specialist (these exams are <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/273011/">much more complex and rigorous</a> ). <br><br>  The overall grade for the course consists of the average grade for homework and the average grade for the final test in a ratio of 50 to 50. Students have the opportunity to exclude marks for the homework for <b>one</b> (arbitrary) week.  This is the case when I did not have time to do the work or did it, but badly. <br><br>  An example of my progress on the course M101N: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/032/2da/666/0322da66659d4b1ebffba50ec60214d0.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Each of the seven weeks is dedicated to a specific topic.  A separate topic is a collection of small video lectures.  Duration varies from one and a half to eight minutes.  The explanation is carried out succinctly, in the case, without marketing husks and pathos (as opposed to one virtual academy).  The video displays either a console or a whiteboard with diagrams, the ‚Äútalking head‚Äù can only be seen in the welcome video. <br><br>  After almost every mini-lecture a quiz is asked.  It is not necessary to answer it, but for self-checking it will be useful to do it.  Usually the question is very simple, additional study of the documentation does not require.  Each question is immediately given a video response, which sometimes constitutes a small lecture.  Answers to test questions are <b>not counted</b> in the overall assessment for the course. <br><br>  There may also be notes under the video if some information from the lecture is outdated or not entirely accurate. <br><br>  You cannot complete the entire course in one week.  Lectures of the next week become available only after the end of the previous one (after the deadline).  It is not necessary to listen to lectures, you can immediately start doing homework. <br><br><h4>  About the course M101N: MongoDB for .NET Developers </h4><br>  The course is based on MongoDB 3.0.4+ and Windows 7/8 / 8.1 / 10 (64 bit).  Considered engines MMap (mostly) and Wired Tiger (differences from the first).  The recommended version of MS Visual Studio is 2013 CE or higher.  2010 <b>will not work</b> , since 2012 there may be problems. <br><br>  Here are the topics for the M101N course: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7d9/dba/79d/7d9dba79d823416488e21b223f4c7456.png" alt="image"><br><br>  I chose this course because I use C # as the server language.  In fact, according to my feelings, only about 10% of the total lecture time is specific to .NET information.  These are CRUD operations using the driver for .NET and a little about using the Aggregation Framework in .NET.  But in many homework to work with the ASP.NET project "Personal Blog" so knowledge of C # and ASP.NET is necessary.  To control the performance of such tasks, you will need to install a special program (MongoProc) that does the checking and sends the result.  No matter how trite, but I recommend reading the task to the end, before starting to do it. <br><br>  The material is unevenly distributed weekly.  Most of the lectures in the second week - it tells about the CRUD operations in the console and using the driver for .NET.  I usually listened to lectures and completed assignments on Saturday and Sunday.  Often, the information from the lecture is not enough for homework, you had to read the documentation. <br><br><h4>  My impressions </h4><br>  I liked the conciseness and clarity of the presentation of the material, the granularity of the lectures (I prefer many small ones for 5 minutes than one big one and a half hours).  I liked the project to create a blog with storage on MongoDB. <br><br>  English is understandable, and if something did not catch, then watched the subtitles. <br><br>  I recommend for anyone who wants to start learning MongoDB, but does not know why. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/277519/">https://habr.com/ru/post/277519/</a></p>
