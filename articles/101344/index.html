After 1-2 weeks the result was very noticeable.  Previously, I did not see the image on the TV, I had to squint.  After doing these exercises for 1-2 weeks, I could watch TV without straining my eyes, everything was clear. <br><br>  It is necessary to perform each exercise for about 30 seconds, although everyone can feel when he has enough. <br><br>  That is, I can say that the exercises are effective. <br><br>  But then I abandoned them, and over time, my vision gradually became worse and worse.  Now I decided to do these exercises for the eyes again. <br>  I suggest you also try these exercises on yourself for several weeks and report the results. <br><br>  <i>Good luck.</i> <br><br>  Read more <a href="http://zdorovja.com.ua/content/blogcategory/61/72/">here.</a> <br><br><h4>  <b>UPD:</b> </h4><br>  Due to the fact that I transferred the article to the ‚ÄúLearn to Work‚Äù blog, I was blocked and the article was transferred to drafts.  After that, the evil people drove my karma into a minus.  But a little later (thanks to the administration) I was unblocked. <br>  Thanks to the help of <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/sicness/" class="user_link">Sicness,</a> I came out of the minus and decided to restore the article in my personal blog, as many people added it to my favorites. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/101344/">https://habr.com/ru/post/101344/</a></p>
