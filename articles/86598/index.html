  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to stop the competition in fooling OpSoSov clients?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today, in the office of a mobile operator, when choosing a tariff for my mother, there was a banal dialogue with the girl who made the contract.  I will not give it, because  he is really banal. <br>  The bottom line: with a sneer, I tried to find out why they were connecting a free weather forecast service, which would later become paid automatically.  I tried to explain to her that not everyone would be able to send an SMS with a text to some number to turn off the service.  For example, my mother or grandmother - just can not. <br><br>  I naively wanted to bring about a human understanding of this, but she was still dry and callous, with a smile on duty, continued to explain to me about the clauses of the contract and the formal duties of the operator. <br><br>  Naturally, I did not intend to change the course of history or to appeal to the conscience of the federal operator, the conversation was of a series of ‚Äúsore‚Äù, and the questions were rhetorical. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Sitting in the car, on the way home, I thought ... I thought about what I would do if I were the CEO / main shareholder of this operator.

      I think I would cut the advertising costs, once it is 10 times. I completely reduced the department that comes up with these "new" tariff grids.  Would leave one or two, maximum three tariffs.  For example: 1 ruble per minute, at any time, on any phone.  This is so simple, honestly, without any footnotes and other things. <br><br>  Also, I would leave one video on TV, where I personally, having presented myself, without any pretentious actors and scenery, would honestly inform the people that we no longer have a parasite department, no advertising budget of several million dollars, thanks to which we can reduce the cost of tariffs. <br><br>  I don‚Äôt know, maybe it‚Äôs spring for me to start acting like that, I don‚Äôt consider myself particularly naive, but I think that such a move would greatly simplify the system and sharply raise the trust rating of the company and accordingly would attract extra.  customers. <br>  Sometimes very much enraged 5-story fiction tariffs. <br>  I understand that the people who invent this work and try for my money, and the goal of their work is to nai ... me.  Wrong it all somehow ... <br><br>  Maybe I'm an idealist, maybe I don‚Äôt know something.  It would be nice to read your opinions in the comments. <br><br>  PS Please do not judge strictly, this is my first post on Habr√© :) <br><br>  <b>UPDATE:</b> Maybe I didn‚Äôt put it right somewhere in the text or someone was embarrassed by the figure of 1 ruble per minute.  I want to clarify: this is not about cost or quality, but about honesty and nothing more.  Many are willing to overpay for something that would be sure that here you will not be deceived. <br><br>  And yet, the user <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/siasia/" class="user_link">siasia</a> enlightened the existence of the operator Net10, a series of commercials can be viewed <a href="http://no-evil.net/">here</a> .  This operator confirmed my idea that you can enter the market without offering revolutionary new services or ultra-low prices.  Main promo idea: honesty.  Like while living in the market -) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/86598/">https://habr.com/ru/post/86598/</a></p>
