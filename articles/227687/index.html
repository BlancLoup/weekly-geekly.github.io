What now needs to be done to gain domination over the whole world? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Firstly, there is a million-dollar Millennium Prize.  But this is not the best possible solution, because by accepting this award you need to publish proof of your discovery, which robs you of the trump card too soon. <br><br>  Instead, you can write an application that uses your proof.  Consider what follows from the equality P = NP.  The main class of tasks for which a certain algorithm can give an answer in polynomial time is R. In some problems, the method of quickly obtaining an answer is unknown, but the answer can be checked in polynomial time; these problems are NP-related.  The equality P = NP may mean that problems, the solution of which was previously considered very difficult, are now solved in polynomial time. <br><br>  Unfortunately, having only one proof without considerations on how to convert it into a working algorithm, it will be very problematic to capture the world.

      The greatest value of P = NP lies in the fields of mathematics, cryptography, artificial intelligence, and even biology. <br><br>  Starting with cryptography, you can now break open symmetric algorithms.  AES was standardized in 2001 and is now one of the most popular symmetric key algorithms used for data transfer in SSL and TLS.  It is considered the ‚Äúgold standard‚Äù of encryption.  And you have proven that it is useless.  One of the best ways to use this is by connecting to a public wireless connection in a crowded place.  All bank traffic that passes by you, you can track.  By capturing this data, you can use brute-force on AES SSL encryption, thereby recovering usernames and passwords from investment and bank accounts.  Now you can transfer money from their accounts to yours.  It is better to use an account in an offshore, so as not to attract the attention of special services, which these transfers are very interested. <br><br>  Keep it up until you get as much money as you need.  After a little practice, you can visit the large banks.  Definitely, the wireless connections will be encrypted, but that won't stop you.  Since you are now working with multimillion accounts, it is necessary to distribute the ‚Äúrevenue‚Äù across several of your accounts in Switzerland or on the Caymans. <br><br>  Being rich is great, but world domination involves a bit more power and glory.  Here we can help medicine and biotechnology. <br><br>  Predicting the structure of proteins is an important goal of bioinformatics and is very important for medicine.  Predicting the tertiary structure of RNA - NP is a complete task.  Fortunately, this is not a problem for you.  Some viruses use pseudoknot structures to form tRNA-like motifs to enter the host cell.  For example, the flu.  By understanding the structure of viruses, you can create much more effective medicines and completely eradicate the common flu. <br><br>  Using your multimillion-dollar capital as seed seed capital, you can open your bioengineering company and explore the structure of viruses to save lives around the world. <br><br>  Up to this point, you have earned some money that saved the world from the flu and any other RNA-based virus (hepatitis C, polio, etc.). You saved millions of lives from many diseases.  The public knows about your contribution to medicine, biology and anthropology.  This contribution is greater than that of Jonas Salk and Louis Pasteur in medicine and biology. <br><br>  Now you can publish your proof P = NP.  The Clay Institute of Mathematics will want to reward you with a Millennium Prize, which you will nobly refuse.  The extra million dollars is only a drop in your capital, but an increase in academic respect will be huge. <br><br>  Finally, you captured the world.  Starting with a basic proof, you stole millions of dollars by hacking SSL or finding access to encrypted banking computers.  Investing in biological research and using P = NP to speed up virus research has given you public recognition, in addition to many of your billions and companies that save millions of lives. <br>  ZY  Did not notice how to put a translation label <br><br>  Source: <a href="http://www.quora.com/Hypothetical-Questions/If-I-just-proved-that-P-NP-how-do-I-start-taking-over-the-world">original message</a> on quora.com. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/227687/">https://habr.com/ru/post/227687/</a></p>
