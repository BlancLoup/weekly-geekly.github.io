Blizzard‚Äôs past and present in faces, from beginning to end, from creating the concept of Diablo I to the rapid development of Diablo III. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e1f/339/24e/e1f33924ebdb45729a42198b0e9b06df.png"><br><br>  ‚ÄúI literally grew up on Diablo, it was an incredibly awesome and fun time spent with the brothers for the game.  I remember later, after the release of Diablo II, I completely demolished the roof.  Hours, days and weeks in the game ... I've been playing all summer.  It was amazing! ‚ÄùThis is how Rob Foote, the lead game producer of the Diablo III development team, recalls the game.  For the past 17 years, he has worked at Blizzard.  The legendary Diablo was the reason why he submitted a resume to work in this company. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For the game designer of Diablo III Joe Shelly - one of the veterans with 10 years experience in Blizzard - the game was momentous and decisive when choosing a place of work.  Diablo II entered the world scene at a time when he was in college, working as an intern in one of those companies.  He spent the nights playing Diablo II, after which he went to work in the morning, completely exhausted and tired.  ‚ÄúIt played an important role in choosing what I really decided to devote myself to - the game.  Do not just play, but work with the game!  Blizzard is the embodiment of desire. ‚Äù

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/a81/e49/ff3/a81e49ff3dfd45c5a596878a635d761d.png"><br><br>  20 years have passed since the moment when Diablo, developed by the American studio Blizzard North and released by Blizzard Entertainment, was released on December 31, 1996.  Many consider the game one of the first Action / RPG: full immersion into the world of a character in a fictional universe and its pumping, non-linear plot, random generation of levels, fast-paced battles, crowds of monsters.  In other words - there is something to remember! <br><br>  Both versions of the game Diablo (1996) and Diablo II (2000) over the past decades have become legends and influenced the development of many other games of this genre.  Diablo III (2012) - already refers to the modern era, it has more rapid battles, an epic storyline and endless pumping of the character. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/3ca/c2d/2ff/3cac2d2ffb594cefbcd4e4396ac62b52.png"><br><br>  When Diablo was just taking her first steps in the industry, VFX-Artist Diablo III and gaming industry veteran Julian Love worked at Sierra On-Line.  One of his fellow programmers discovered the world of Diablo for him.  The following months, creating the appearance of work in the Sierra office, the guys fought and pumped characters into Diablo. <br><br>  Julian Love: ‚ÄúFor some reason, I still worked on Sierra On-Line when Diablo II came out.  The game has become an obsession.  My conversations were about Diablo, everything was spinning around Diablo.  At one point, a sober understanding came: why am I still not in the Blizzard team.  So, I filed a resignation with Sierra On-Line. ‚Äù  Since Julian joined the Diablo II development team 15 years have passed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/669/1e9/df1/6691e9df1bcd4da787cad8e1b99d4100.png"><br><br>  Rob Foote, who before joining Blizzard, worked in a completely different field, far from game development, began as a tester.  "Being just a part of Diablo was something exciting for me." <br><br><h3>  History of origin </h3><br><blockquote>  Diablo is a role-playing game in which the player creates one character and leads him through the dungeon, trying to find and destroy the Devil himself (Diablo).  All actions take place in an isometric three-quarter perspective. </blockquote>  In 1993, the brothers Erich and Max Schaefer (Erich, Max Schaefer), together with David Brevik (David Brevik) created a company to develop games Condor.  Their goal is to develop an RPG game, create a gothic world, a dark fantasy digital space, without orcs and elves.  What was needed was an original approach, the creation of something really creepy, filled with the feeling that something terrible was approaching.  A game in which a fierce battle is everything! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/b37/896/1d7/b378961d7c0c4b9baaf5064d0b9805b2.png"><br><br>  ‚ÄúDiablo was exactly the game I wanted to play,‚Äù says Erich Sch√§fer.  ‚ÄúWhen I was younger, I spent a lot of time playing the board game Dungeons &amp; Dragons (D &amp; D).  He was a Master, described the gaming world and the events taking place in it, invented various legends in which transient and fierce battles were fought.  A special feature of Diablo is an RPG, which can be played with one hand, there are a lot of loot and items. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/208/6a6/905/2086a6905684480c98d844a412942e01.png"><br><br>  In addition to the original idea, in the early stages of development it was clear that Diablo would become a product in the style of the popular X-Com strategy, which is characterized by step-by-step battles.  The actions began in Tristram, in increasing order leading the players deeper and deeper into Sheol to the devil himself, to absolute evil.  The fight at the beginning of the game immediately made it clear to the players that it was waiting for them further ... Violence!  Violent battle, the confrontation of the Underworld and Heaven, and so on for all three versions. <br><br>  Let's return to the time when everything was just beginning.  Condor faced a problem: no one at the time wanted to finance the development of RPG games for personal computers running DOS.  The reaction of publishers, in which the team served with Diablo, was basically the same: playing in this genre is not for a wide gaming community, but for a small hardcore audience.  The Condor team, to stay afloat, took on the development of games on the contract. <br><br>  "We took up the development of the Justice League Task Force, a fighting game genre for the Sega Genesis console.  It was a fight game with Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman, "recalls Condor co-founder and former Blizzard North president David Brevik." We demonstrated our game at CES, and it turned out that there was another company that did a similar thing for Super Nintendo consoles. We were surprised to say so little, because no one chatted, the idea did not go beyond the limits of the team! ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/509/6f4/613/5096f4613e44444d819cc969b5184083.png"><br><br>  The developer of the version for Super Nintendo Justice League Task Force turned out to be Silicon &amp; Synapse.  The game development company was just in the process of changing its name to Blizzard Entertainment and was preparing to debut in the PC gaming market with a new strategic game in real time called Warcraft: Orcs &amp; Humans. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/1d6/00d/512/1d600d512a9c4d038b6fd9da86f52f3f.png"><br><br>  David Brevik recalls the feeling of a relationship with this company that appeared at that moment.  ‚ÄúMy thoughts were spinning: oh, computer games.  After all, this is what we live, we love computer games, and what's more, we are gamers.  Now we are engaged in projects for the maintenance of pants, in the hope of realizing our game idea, which we are burning!  We knocked with her on various doors, 50 times were rejected.  Nobody wants to play our game, because they consider role-playing games to be dead, with Diablo we would breathe life to this genre. ‚Äù <br><br>  Blizzard Entertainment was just putting the final touches on its brainchild of Warcraft, the conversation with Condor continued, and soon the two studios became close.  The Sondor team even offered to protest the innovative RTS game from Blizzard.  After the successful debut of Warcraft in 1994, Blizzard visited Condor and listened to everything about their RPGs.  ‚ÄúIt seemed that Blizzard just fell in love with Diablo,‚Äù Brevik continues, ‚Äútwo months later, after their visit, a contract was signed, we immediately began to develop.  The development took more than two years, we worked together so much that we were ready for the merger of two studios, soon Blizzard bought Sondor and we became known as Blizzard North. ‚Äù <br><br><h3>  Gothic fantasy with superheroes </h3><br>  ‚ÄúAt that time we called this genre gothic fantasy.  It was a tangle of desire to be different than all the craving for dark and gloomy Italian zombie films, ‚Äùsays Erich Sch√§fer, talking about the amazing visual shell of Diablo I, then he was the lead designer and art director.  ‚ÄúWe were overwhelmed by the desire to make the game cruel and demanding.  I wanted you to kill the first monster, smashing his head with a shovel before you get a sword, ‚Äùhe adds immediately.  "Many images were taken from my memories of traveling through castles, churches and catacombs." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/824/f73/502/824f735025104e5d93b83f21addb54bc.png"><br><br>  ‚ÄúAtmosphere and tone are the two constants that remain unchanged throughout all three parts of the Diablo.  I adore horrors as a genre, all three parts leave a unique feeling of reigning fear, ‚Äùsays Rob Foote, recalling the visual design of the world, starting from Diablo to Diablo III.  ‚ÄúI remember this first meeting with the Butcher, one of his kind was making fear.  And the quest in Diablo II with the Countess who bathes in the bloodbath!  You can not forget it.  Remember in 1 act there is the location of the Lost fields?  And in it an abandoned farm, from the basement of which a farmer comes out and tells how he and his wife were hiding from scavengers, you go down to the basement at the farmer‚Äôs request, so that his wife would thank you for saving ... and she is a withered corpse! ‚Äù <br><br>  Erich Schaefer: ‚ÄúEvil, gothic attitude, cruelty is just one component of the equation called Diablo.  We managed to attract and keep gamers, anyway, we hit the bull's eye, inviting you to feel like a superhero in a battle with absolute evil. ‚Äù <br><br>  Joe Shelley: ‚ÄúDuring the game, you have to become so strong that you can overcome the whole fiend of hell.  You have to reach such heights of character development, get and get all sorts of items that will enhance your abilities to the level of "god." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/bee/a54/662/beea546625e34cb3b2ee4dd2f25212d5.png"><br><br>  "All battles take place with monsters, there are no hidden enemies in Diablo, adds Julian Love - this is an important component of Diablo, there is no gray, only white and black." The beauty of Gothic is that during the battle there is no thought, but correctly Do I do from a moral point of view, killing. No, you clearly understand that you are not killing people, you are fighting monsters, demons, eradicating evil. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/c5d/706/a55/c5d706a5583545a191f9564e6dd6803f.jpg"><br><br>  ‚ÄúDespite the fact that I am a non-religious person, I think that the devil and the demons are enemies by steeper giant rats or orcs,‚Äù says Erich Sch√§fer.  ‚ÄúYes, during the game, monsters-cannon fodder come across, but the main question is: is there a villain more powerful than the devil?‚Äù <br><br><h3>  Birth Online Action-RPG </h3><br>  During the development of the game, in, initially one user turn-based RPG, Diablo made a number of changes.  The main thing among them was the proposal from Blizzard - even before the advent of Blizzard North - real-time fighting. <br><br>  From David Brevik‚Äôs memoirs: ‚ÄúI remember this moment as if it was yesterday when we abandoned the Diablo's turn-based steps and transferred the game to real-time mode.  We had a rather heated discussion about this in our office.  I resisted such changes, did not want to change anything, I was attracted by a deep step-by-step system, in which each turn was divided into several parts.  There is nothing to compare those feelings during the rogue-like games: oh my god, what to do, I have quite a bit of health left ?!  It is necessary to make a decision, dig in the inventory, find a way out of a difficult situation.  Risk!  You make a move and ... you die!  A couple of weeks of character pumping ... And you start again.  The game in real time did not create such tension, so I defended step-by-step. ‚Äù <br><br>  It was difficult to assess how the Diablo type RPG real-time translation would affect, it was a new experience for those who played it after the release.  Julian Love recalls: ‚ÄúI was a fan of the first multiplayer arcade game Gauntlet.  But when Diablo came out, I lost myself for many days in its depths, I got hooked on it from the very first launch. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/25a/76f/21b/25a76f21b5e643558890ea78db3a392e.png"><br><br>  David Brevik was worried that such a transition to real time could delay the already protracted game development process.  In addition, more money was needed to complete the project.  But, the majority of the team voted for real time. <br><br>  It was Friday, David was left alone in the office, alone with his greatest fear.  ‚ÄúI thought: it will take forever.  You guys better go home.  When the guys came back on Monday, lo and behold!  Everything worked.  I remember how I started the game, clicked the mouse on the screen and my character with a sword in his hands went and broke the skeleton into pieces!  It was something!  And then the following happened: everyone in the company just stayed after work and played.  Usually people do not stay after the working day to spend their leisure time at work!  But with Diablo everything was different, we stayed and played what we worked on during the day. ‚Äù <br><br>  Because of the transition to real time combat, it became necessary to revise a lot, starting from the behavior of monsters, pumping skills to objects and, of course, trophies (loot). <br><br>  The second major change, which was needed a little later - online output - you can devote a whole story: getting to know Diablo from Battle.net.  For the development team, the creation of a multiplayer game could be a major formidable obstacle.  For further work, the code for multiplayer was needed, and how to work with multiplayer, and indeed with the network, was not yet known to Condor.  In the end, all this opened the veil over the new arena called online gaming. <br><br>  Rob Fut recalls: ‚ÄúDiablo II was the first real online game that I played at that time.  It was a completely new experience when, while playing on Battle.net, you are chatting with people about what is happening in Diablo, and then plunge into the game.  Let's just say this habit has remained to this day: playing Diablo III, we chat with gamers who go through Seasons and discuss their characters.  Many here also play Hardcore, during the game you go beyond your game world, join the stories of other players, become part of the Diablo community. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/384/8ae/07a/3848ae07a9494b8da49941df8dcd886d.png"><br><br><h3>  How Heaven and Hell Sound </h3><br>  Well, we continue to make the first impression!  Exterior design in the style of dark fantasy, the ability to play online multiplayer game, what else will make you feel the atmosphere of Diablo?  Of course, music and sound effects.  Matt Owman - made Diablo and Diablo II sound.  He began his collaboration with Blizzard North in 1996. <br><blockquote>  We wanted to achieve a timeless sound that embodies the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãeternal confrontation and is different from the music of other Blizzard games.  For this reason, we decided to combine eclectic guitars and flutes, and also weave into the fabric of music the sound of small ensembles, which fifteen years ago, players first heard in the vicinity of Tristram. </blockquote>  Russell Brouwer, music composer of Activision Blizzard, without him games such as World of Warcraft, Starcraft II, Diablo III would sound completely different: ‚ÄúThe diversity of the sound of the game was impressive.  The original Diablo was the first Blizzard game that I played not because of <br>  that it was part of my job.  Music, sound effects exceeded all expectations.  The soundtrack became part of the Diablo universe, as the last puzzle in the film completed the creation of an awesome atmosphere reigning in the game. ‚Äù <br><br>  Before joining Blizzard in 2005, Russell Brower was actively involved in animation and storytelling.  For him and the Blizzard sound team, the game is a kind of religious cult, it is a passion, it is a craving for the creation of new worlds and stories.  ‚ÄúThe key word is history.  The game may still be a concept, a scenario, everything can only be at the stage of gray textures, but you still feel its scale and atmosphere anyway!  Matt Oulmen showed us the way to move forward, to develop the most powerful instrument of the game - sound.  In Diablo III, music acquired a new dimension: orchestral arrangements, vocal parts of the British and Irish choir, rich tone of voices, each of which conveys a certain shade of emotions.  Every sound is a unique guide to the world of Diablo! ‚Äù <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EgbUSsblCSQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  ‚ÄúAs a composer, I must feel every detail, hear and revive it with sound.  I felt something ancient and primitive from the objects, so I started thinking about the duduk.  Duduk - this is the oldest wind musical instrument, was an integral part of the Armenian people.  Consciousness in the biblical era, in the city, buried under the sands of the desert.  The sound of the duduk spatially transfers us to that atmosphere. ‚Äù <br><br>  The musical design of Diablo III evolved in the same way as its history; from the very first seconds of launching the game, the music gives an emotional touch to what is happening.  Dark fantasy is filled with the theme of loss, regret.  The composer must be able to fully convey the drama of each scene of the game. <br><br>  Russell Brouwer, recalling one of the most dramatic scenes: ‚ÄúThere was a character named Leah, that was something in her storyline that really hurt me.  At one point, I felt a sense of kinship between our experiences and her (at that time I had some sort of trouble in real life) I drew a parallel with the character of the game, sat down at the piano ... and played Leah.  The finished romantic who splashed out the emotions on the keys, it took 20 minutes. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/fec/459/337/fec4593372864422bf1331d6063226fd.png"><br><br><h3>  Second coming </h3><br>  ‚ÄúAt the beginning, none of us thought that we were creating something innovative,‚Äù reflects Erich Schaefer.  ‚ÄúYes, we developed a high-quality product in the hope that the public would like it.  But we were obviously not ready for such a scale of success.  We could not even imagine that our idea would have such an impact on the future development of games. ‚Äù  For Schaefer and the inexperienced, but passionate Blizzard North team, the popularity and successful sale of Diablo became the embodiment of their wildest dreams and dreams.  ‚ÄúAfter we finished Diablo, there were other ideas for games, but we were still too sick with Diablo,‚Äù recalls David Brevik. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/0a7/6fa/cad/0a76facad33c467ea0a1095bc51dd290.png"><br><br>  ‚ÄúWe realized that it was time to leave Diablo behind and start moving forward.  We have been creating Diablo for several years, it was one of the longest projects we have ever worked on. ‚Äù  When the Blizzard team moved from Warcraft to the development of StarCraft, Blizzard North decided to start a new project, which would be similar to the previous one.  Work began on the bugs, especially it was necessary to do something with cheating. <br><br>  Following the example of Blizzard (developed by Warcraft II), the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating Diablo II began to seem like the right decision.  ‚ÄúIt was only four months after the release of Diablo, before we started working on Diablo II.  We again got excited with the idea and were ready to plunge headlong into the creation of a more perfect product, ‚Äùexplains Brevik. <br><br> ¬´  ,    ,  ,       .     ,        ¬ª. <br><br><h3>   </h3><br>   ,   ‚Äî    .
