No, you do not want!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><blockquote>  Of the 50 people starting freelancing, only 1 remains in it for more than 2 years. </blockquote><br><br>  Unfortunately, whatever the global statistics on the growth trend of purebred freelancers is not present, so I used statistics based on my own observations.  And I would like to share my thoughts on this topic. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Let's start with the earliest freelancers (those that appeared 5 years ago, at the dawn of this phenomenon).  These brave conquistadors had clear goals in front of them: Down with the stupid directorate, giving you creative freedom, more money, and a sense of independence.  According to them, the image of freelancing as a work and as a lifestyle, they were his live advertising.  It was looking at them, reading about their life, about how wonderful it was in freelancing, the rest followed.  But the paradox of freelancing is like a good, even beautiful and, in general, paradise, and only a few are serious about it.  Why?  Here, of course, we can talk about difficulties, that freelancing is not for everyone, and it accepts only strong, purposeful and blah blah blah ... It is possible, but I will not.  Because this is not the case, or rather, not only this ... 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

      Take, for example, a dozen people.  Boys or girls are not the essence, let them be both.  And ask them, for example: "Do you want a beautiful sports figure?".  Here everyone will nod in unison.  And who does not want to like others and feel healthy?  We will ask further: ‚ÄúAnd what do we need to do for this, we know?‚Äù Of course, we know: do sports, go to the gym, monitor nutrition, and so on ...  Everything.  There were excuses, excuses or just deathly silence. <br><br>  Another example.  Do you want to become a famous writer?  Bank director?  Famous actress?  A world famous singer?  Artist, so that in life all admired?  A designer working in a lounge chair on a Malibu beach?  A developer whose name will be associated with everything new and progressive?  An architect who invented a new style?  Want to? <br><br>  <b>Not!</b> <br><br>  Because you want to have hundreds of bestsellers, not write them.  You want to go to work as little as possible, and not to figure out how to make millions.  And you also do not want to draw, but you want a beach, money and fame. <br><br>  Here are 50 beginner freelancers as well.  They want to get up after dinner, they want to have money when they need it, not when they are given it.  They want to work in warm countries and preferably in coziness and comfort, and not get 2 hours to 30 degrees of frost to cramped, crushing office walls. <br><br>  And that's fine.  That's just nothing to do with freelancing. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/79466/">https://habr.com/ru/post/79466/</a></p>
