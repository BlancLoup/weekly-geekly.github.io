    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  As for each thing, you can determine this by asking the question - ‚Äúwhy is it for me?‚Äù And, if the answer is in the style ‚ÄúI want, I like it to be‚Äù, etc.  - then this is the <strong>goal</strong> , and if "then, to ..." is already a <strong>means of</strong> achieving some other goal.  Let's look at a few examples. <br><br><h3>  About the web. </h3><br>  For example, almost every "serious" web studio writes its own engine - as if that is their <em>goal</em> .  What for?  As a result, we have thousands of them, but each time having an explicit task, we are faced with the fact that the means to solve it are not perfect (it would be cool on Drupal, but with a module from Joomla and without unnecessary functionality that you will never use).  Is it not better to unite and define the tasks facing the engines of the sites to write them a little, one for each task, and at the same time ideally or close to the ideal performing their functions? <br>  Or forums.  Each habrayuzer saw dozens of dead forums, and some even created them.  Yes, they sought to the <em>goal</em> - to create a forum.  Some have succeeded, we have seen many lively, user-friendly forums that have become full-fledged communities.  And the difference is that those forums that ‚Äúshot‚Äù were created as a <em>means</em> for uniting some community, or for communicating on some interesting topic.  Those who died were created as a <em>goal</em> . <br><br><h3>  About software. </h3><br>  Programs, especially under Windows (I can already imagine how the trolls are grinning, anticipating the next holivar)), have a lot of analogues.  If there are more than one of them, it only means that they are not ideal in some way, otherwise they would be so similar that they would not be different.  Why don't the authors of these similar programs join forces?  Apparently, their <em>goal</em> is not to create a <em>tool</em> that maximally satisfies the needs of future users in achieving their goals, but simply to do something ‚Äútheir own‚Äù that may bring them some kind of profit, fame, respect, or something else.  At the same time, they are guided by a massive and inexperienced user of Windows, unlike Linux (where the entire developer community has one <em>goal</em> - the development and promotion of free software, and therefore sees programs as a <em>tool</em> ) or a Mac (where Steve Jobs and Apple seek to create ideal <em>tools</em> like hardware and software, and this philosophy was transferred to individual software developers and teams), which indirectly confirms this assumption. <br>  In a recent discussion on the need for a file manager, great ideas were expressed, but they, as all opponents of the idea noticed, cannot be implemented until they realize that software is a <em>tool</em> , and accordingly, the <em>goals of</em> writing it among individual people and the community as a whole will not change. .  And the <strong>situation will change qualitatively</strong> only when the necessary number of people who have changed the paradigm is gathered. <br><br><h3>  About blogs. </h3><br>  ‚ÄúI keep a diary to read me,‚Äù many bloggers can say.  ¬© Wikipedia <br>  That is, roughly representing the interests of the reader, the blogger writes about what is interesting to his readers (and to himself, since he has his own opinion about this).  Then the author‚Äôs <em>goal</em> is to convey a thought to the reader, and a blog is a <em>means</em> to do this. <br>  Why do we need thousands of standalone blogs, where they write about the same?  Maybe that's why most of them have so few readers, although there are resources where you can present your thoughts to thousands of people? <br>  For example, some habrausers have their own blogs.  Sometimes it is even the subject of IT.  Why not write immediately on Habr?  The two most popular objections are ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt pinch there‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm writing to <em>my</em> blog, with <em>my</em> readers, with <em>my own</em> advertising‚Äù ... <br>  Both objections seem to me untenable.  The first thing about ‚Äúzaminusayut‚Äù only shows that these bloggers are not sure about the value of the information that they want to convey to readers for the readers themselves.  The second is about <em>your</em> blog - on Habr√© everyone has at least his own blog, at most - a lot of thematic blogs, which is more convenient for readers. <br>  Do you think this is a substitute for goals and means? <br>  My thoughts about advertising on blogs and moneymakers will be written in a separate post if it will be interesting to someone and they will say so. <br><br><h3>  About passive income. </h3><br>  I think so, the whole problem is in the pursuit of passive income.  The fact that people are looking for a way to do something once and will always make a profit.  Believing people in passive income is half the trouble.  If you do something convenient, something that can become a means to something else - passive income can be.  Otherwise, no project would survive, with donate monetization.  The main trouble is that people are looking for a way to give the next "bicycle" for something great and have a piece of paper that <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/51742/">protects the idea</a> .  The concept of intellectual property, which has caused so much controversy lately, holds on to this great power. <br>  Regarding the rights to musical works, I like the approaches of Radiohead and Peter Nalitch.  Yes, they still earn on their work.  But they act as if their <em>goal</em> is to give the opportunity to hear their works to as many people as possible.  Accordingly, the recordings themselves, in mp3 or in other formats, is not a goal, but a <em>means</em> to convey to the listeners information about what they will get by attending a concert (in the case of Nalich), or simply to understand what the performer (Radiohead) wants to say, and if they will like donate. <br><br><h3>  Conclusions or information for thought. </h3><br>  Have you noticed that everywhere is a <em>means, a means</em> ?  And if there is a <em>goal</em> somewhere, the cycle will break and no infinity will succeed.  And that is why the meaning of each thing, phenomenon or something else - to be a <em>means</em> for something else.  And in the end, if you ask for a long, long time, ‚ÄúWhy is it for me?‚Äù And answer ‚Äú <em>means</em> ‚Äù each time, then at the very end it will be to <strong>change the world for the better</strong> .  Whoever asked and whoever answered. <br>  <em>All other goals</em> lead to anything, but not to this.  And they divert attention from the main thing.  And people strive for goals that do not change them, do not change the world in which they live, for the better.  And in the end, you have to justify your time spent, a bunch of some meaningless events, things ... A crisis? <br>  But at any time, each of us may ask ourselves: why do I need this thing, or this trip, or this meeting, or something else?  And the world will be better))) <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/51835/">https://habr.com/ru/post/51835/</a></p>
