  <section class="page js-page"><h1>First-line support bikes: great work if you have strong nerves</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/102/1f1/046/1021f1046bef4ba08eafc346e830da75.jpg"><br><br>  We support the office of one service company and would like to tell you a little about our work.  To set the mood, so to speak.  In general, our day looks the same: we come in, log in to the cisco agent, sit down at the phone and start listening to the Wishlist users.  Something we resolve ourselves, something we pass the second line alongside.  Despite the fact that the customer‚Äôs office consists primarily of engineers, tickets are not very different from those of an oil and gas company or a state-owned company.  Of course, without having to drive 200 kilometers to plug in the printer (real case), but still. <br><br>  Although, for example, this difference manifested itself very strongly when the security guards once again gave the task to walk around the cabinets and see who stores the recorded passwords in the workplace.  At first, without surprises - somewhere every thirty ths is recording and gluing to the monitor.  The problem was that if in accounting these are correct passwords (‚ÄúHow does a spy know that this is a password, eh?‚Äù), Cunning engineers specially write down some random combinations of characters.  Apparently, they make fun of the guards. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Of course, technicians and techmen who live in the office solve problems for the majority on their own (well, or they put very clear tickets, where everything is done in a couple of clicks).  But there are also various ‚Äúadditional services‚Äù, such as: a cafeteria or a gym.  Some of them even sometimes give us a lot of joy with their tickets with the request to install World of Tanks on the computer.  Or: ‚ÄúI hear people in the monitor, but no one hears me!‚Äù

      But there are also situations when ordinary users give out something extraordinary.  For example, I especially remember the call with a panic about the fact that the window does not close, but urgently.  Remote connection is not prokinili.  Well, okay, probably, a personal laptop, something is bogged down, the user urgently needs.  We sent enikeya.  It turned out that there was a girl left alone in a large office, and she could not reach the window handle.  A strong wind was blowing. <br><br>  A couple of times pushed the car from the parking lot, once helped to swing the wheel.  Why?  Because they knock on us when they don't know who to turn to.  We are the support.  We will always help.  In ITSM, working hours for such things are written off under the column ‚Äúunsupported service‚Äù - before that there were all sorts of things with application software that are not included in our SLA, and now for the most part these are just these strange requests.  No, of course, we filter them, but sometimes we still do it anyway.  The user is very difficult to explain what is to us and what is not.  The most vivid example is when a person does not receive a sandwich in a slot machine on the floor, but cannot return the money, he first hits the slot machine, and then writes a ticket to us. <br><br>  Naturally, everyone needs everything yesterday - but this, I think, is a given for each first line. <br><br>  Sometimes there are days of hell - this is when users have time for a planned change of passwords.  For such a day, 70‚Äì80 calls per employee can be made: everyone needs to enter accounts.  This is not counting the usual problems such as out of toner or a broken power supply. <br><br>  There are very few problems with viruses - the company has good NGFW and sandboxes, so all the epidemics pass by.  The only thing - again, personal devices.  In the savvy they are protected, but the same guard suffers.  I had a ticket about a crazy guard who clicked on a video about the State Duma, but got into porn.  On the spot it turned out that he was watching some great site where the YouTube blocks were just drawn, but in fact they were an IMG with a referral link to a porn site.  I saved a person's psyche then. <br><br>  Another person nearly blew the roof off our engineer.  The ticket is as follows: when it copies and inserts the login and password, it turns out.  When hands injected - no.  Looking for a long time.  Then, almost by chance, they looked at the encoder - he had O in the login Russian, not Latin, like everyone else.  Who and how did it - it is not clear. <br><br>  Often, personal laptops are brought to us for repair ‚Äî reload after a system crash, rearrange something, and so on.  Since users still work for them in the office, we help (semi-officially, again - ‚Äúunsupported service‚Äù).  Users sometimes thank.  Again, if the girls are usually candy and cakes, then the protection is always clearly and specifically affixed to beer.  The same.  Like a clock.  It seems that they have an internal instruction there, how much beer and for what to give. <br><br>  Because of the autogeneration of logins, ‚Äúthe first letter of the name is a surname‚Äù often innocent people suffer.  Ticket excellent - the least lucky Eugene.  Well at least with the name Banny, we have no one.  Here we play the role of psychological support and acquaint the user with a catalog of about a hundred of such excellent logins of current employees.  He realizes that he is not alone, and calms down a bit. <br><br>  Once a security girl from a bookkeeping department was so frightened that she wrote a special ticket, so that we moved the monitor on the table 11 centimeters to the left.  By the way, with monitors a frequent question from accounting when replacing is whether the labels will remain.  Soothe.  Will persist. <br><br>  Once asked to enable Sony PlayStation4, and within the framework of the supported service.  We look - it is really supported, now it‚Äôs alone in the rest room. <br><br>  People who are stuck somewhere in the elevator (not necessarily in the office), when there are problems with air conditioners, constantly knock on us.  There was once a ticket "we have a rehearsal in the gym here - we need guys to dance." <br><br>  Complaints about the lack of electricity - to us.  The screen must be changed in the corporate bus - to us.  Once an employee went to the balcony to watch the cable and accidentally closed.  I called the general line, I had to write as a ticket.  In general, sometimes we differ in intelligence and ingenuity. <br><br>  Once, telecom operators complained about a bad wi-fi reception in the office.  They hung a new access point right inside.  They took laptops and went to work in the dining room.  The next day, they dragged some suitcase from the warehouse, measured the field everywhere, calmed down. <br><br>  There are funny situations when people do not log out, and their colleagues start writing wild tickets on their behalf.  ‚ÄúMake me coffee‚Äù is the simplest.  One time the user wanted to learn how to play table tennis, and our floor above is just a gym with a table for him.  Well, look - put such a ticket.  Because I decided not to call, apparently. <br><br>  There is a vampire user: he has been writing applications for 6 years only after sunset.  We do not know him, but we are closing the tickets.  Probably some kind of support for the communication lines of the Far East.  By the way, yes, the most interesting time for the night shift is 4‚Äì5 in the morning, when Irkutsk wakes up and begins to set urgent tasks. <br><br>  Users harness.  Recently, I first encountered a man who redrew the entire layout (including the mouse) - left-handed, it is more convenient for him.  And I had a whole adventure.  When a new person gets acquainted with his ‚Äúadmin‚Äù, sometimes it happens ‚Äúcan you see and select everyone?‚Äù.  Some users have direct telephones of specific engineers hanging near the workplace, despite the fact that we did not give them.  Somehow I helped a user with hotkeys - showed a wonderful new world of fast work.  On the same day, some more tickets came - he shared with colleagues what we teach. <br><br>  Of course, we, too, sometimes become the causes of incidents in the office.  We are testing something or soldering it - they come to prescribe their own firemen.  One more time, we had a whole bang from the Eychara - we washed the windows in the office, so we printed naked women to these guys and pasted them from the inside.  They thought they would be more fun.  No, they filed a complaint, they say, we insult their human dignity.  They wanted to be kind - did not work. <br><br>  Well, today, probably, we will get on the head from our colleague Stas.  Because I just can not tell this story.  We have two rooms, we are in the first, and Stas with the team - in the second.  The fact is that once we met every user who came to visit, listened carefully and said that it was Stas who specialized in his question.  And he will solve it best.  The user went to another room and addressed him personally.  Stas almost went crazy, wondering why everyone goes only in his soul.  Well, now, probably, will find out. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/338384/">https://habr.com/ru/post/338384/</a></p>
