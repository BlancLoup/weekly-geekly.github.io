      A little earlier, I read the opinion of Fomenko about history, and the review of ‚ÄúRussians‚Äù bylinas from Prozorov.  It is funny that the Second commemorates the first in one paragraph in the middle of the text, commemorates as an idiot, and he writes exactly in the same way, and approximately on the same grounds - only by eye, and not with the support of stat-analysis.  Very interesting opinion from both. <br><br>  And even earlier - read Danchenko. <br><br>  All these books are not without errors and distortions, well, where without them - but there are few errors in them, and there are many correct ones and benefits from it.  Basically, the distortions are caused by the fact that the authors are forced to defend themselves in advance against the attacks of "erring orthodox", and write texts in advance by taking up a defense position.  This measure is forced, and not being such an orthodox, when reading it is necessary to make a non-weak discount for it.  And mistakes - in trivialities unessential, when the author slightly jumps out of his field, and tries to write for one thing about something that he does not really understand.  But as a rule, such errors do not affect the usefulness, persuasiveness and integrity of the main topic of the author. <br><br>  They would all read each other, and rewrite the books with a smaller number of their own delusions for reasons that are secondary to each of them - that would be progress! <br><br>  PS: <a name="habracut"></a>  details: <br><br>  "Naughty child of the biosphere" (Dolnik) - a book about the role of instincts in people's lives, about their sources, purpose, benefit and harm, about their unawareness, about their manifestations.  About their evolutionary and biological origin.  Until the author begins to try to give an illustrative excursion into evolution, history, politics or biology, everything is just great.  But, as usual with such excursions it turns out that they are not needed to confirm the thesis, it has been confirmed without them, so they don‚Äôt spoil the book.  The best version of the electronic form - on <a href="http://ethology.ru/library/%3Fid%3D321">http://ethology.ru/library/?id=321</a> <br><br>  "The history of the Earth and life on it" (Eskov, in LJ - afranius, see also <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2595%25D1%2581%25D1%258C%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2">in Wikipedia</a> ) is an amazing description of the evolution of the Earth itself and of life on it in terms of integrity, consistency and completeness of presentation.  Biological and paleontological review with excursions into geophysics, biochemistry and much more.  Read in one breath.  Small errors were noticed in some physical excursions in the first parts of the book, but practically no constructions are made on them, so the usefulness and correctness of the main material of the book does not suffer.  Link to the html-version of the book is <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2595%25D1%2581%25D1%258C%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2">in Wikipedia</a> , others - in Yandex. <br><br>  "Fundamental questions of the general theory of chakras" (Vladimir Danchenko) is also a text from the category "Mandatory Fiction" - but there are suspicions that the reader who did not turn around in the subject of mental shells and bodies, chakras and energies, Hinduism and other mysticism, these are his amazing "demystification" may not be perceived.  That would be about the same thing, but for an unprepared reader - this would be one hundred percent what people need!  The book is about the essence, history, discoveries and delusions on the path of self-examination of a person by the method of introspection.  Native website of the author and his large library of all psychological - <a href="http://psylib.org.ua/books/danch01/index.htm">http://psylib.org.ua/books/danch01/index.htm</a> <br><br>  "Truth in theses" (Frost).  He writes about the fact that it is necessary to live understanding, and about the fact that entrepreneurship (enterprise) and that on the other hand is work (wage labor).  I got to something like that myself, but the uncle writes well.  About our constitution it is very interesting to push it in ‚Äî that if everyone lived on it, it would be cool.  Taxes are unconstitutional, for example.  Now, if he hadn‚Äôt yet been pushing in the presentation of the text so intrusively, according to the market ... Not everyone can ignore this "bazaar flavor", some are disgusting.  Although, it seems that many people are pecking at this, it is for this reason that he merges into speech with all the traders.  In general, in my opinion, those clever things that he writes do not need such pushing and, moreover, it impresses with the impression.  <a href="http://shsd.ru/">The website of the author</a> , though this book is for some reason not there.  But it is in runet on a heap of clone sites with advertising - for example, <a href="http://www.lib-rar.com/lib_boks_102085.html">http://www.lib-rar.com/lib_boks_102085.html</a> <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe times of Russian warriors. According to the epic pages - deep into the times‚Äù (Prozorov) - writes that the epics are all ours from near Krakow.  And he cites extensive factual material and many references to other researchers as evidence.  At the same time, the text is readable, not academic.  Very interesting written.  <a href="http://lib.aldebaran.ru/author/prozorov_lev/prozorov_lev_vremena_russkih_bogatyrei_po_stranicam_bylin_v_glub_vremen">Aldebaran is currently available</a> for download in any format. <br><br>  "New empirical-statistical methods of dating ancient events and applications to the global chronology of the ancient and medieval world" (Fomenko) is a text about how and on what basis the Fomenko team came to its conclusions about history.  And a little about the findings themselves.  In several formats <a href="http://bookz.ru/authors/fomenko-anatolii/novie-em_723.html">available on bookz.ru</a> <br><br>  "You can not teach a foreign language" (Zamyatkin) - promises to be interesting, and in about the same way.  UPD: Began to read, the author of joker.  But writing seems to be the case.  And indeed, in the same way - see subzh.  The book is <a href="http://zamyatkin.com/forum/viewtopic.php%3Fid%3D33">on the website of the author</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/44486/">https://habr.com/ru/post/44486/</a></p>
