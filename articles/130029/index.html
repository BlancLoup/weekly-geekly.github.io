In the overwhelming majority of cases, this is an attempt to lure money from users by sending paid SMS messages.  Well, those who want to get some material benefit by exploiting the popular brand and the gullibility (or lack of knowledge of life safety on the Internet) of users have always been, is and will be.  True, in recent months, the number of fraudsters and their victims is growing exponentially, which is not good at all.  I can say that according to the most conservative estimates, the monthly turnover of this ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù is several tens of millions, and according to immodest - already hundreds of millions of rubles.  Yours, a gullible user, rubles, carefully placed on the balance of a mobile phone. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Of course, it‚Äôs not easy to fool the vigilance of experienced users - the fact that all Opera browsers are distributed completely free is no secret and we constantly remind about it using CAPS LOCK and <b>Bold</b> fonts.  But the problem is that there are not as many experienced as we would like.  It‚Äôs just the time to send all informatics teachers a lightning-manual, asking them to begin each lesson with the words "Remember, kids, Opera browsers are free, and in no case give your money to crooks."  But even such measures will not completely eliminate the possibility of fraud - swindlers very intelligently disguise their websites under the official Opera.com pages, using original design elements and logos.  By the way, even I, an employee of the company, once could not find clear signs that by clicking on a banner placed on Opera‚Äôs mobile portal through an affiliate advertising network, I went straight to the rogue website.  I just knew that they were crooks, but I did not find any visible evidence.

      In general, the scale of the problem is very significant.  Only in August, the number of Russian users who came to the sites of crooks through Opera Mini, amounted to more than 3.5 million.  It is not possible to calculate the number of victims of fraudsters who came to them from other browsers.  Every week, several dozens of new clone domains are registered in RuNet, which are members of the general network for pumping money from users.  To date, we have struggled with the problem on our own, scanning the Internet for new scam sites and <a href="">receiving information about those from users</a> .  But now it's time to tackle this issue on a larger scale, at a new level. <br><br>  I am glad to announce that today we have agreements with all the largest Russian mobile operators, who are no less concerned about the problem of cheating with Opera Mini - as a rule, deceived users first of all write angry complaints to their operator, and it‚Äôs the operator who has to return the money to the balance user  Therefore, we decided to jointly investigate each case of fraud and, thanks to this, to identify and terminate the activities of unscrupulous content providers. <br><br>  So, if you have found another ‚Äúdivorce‚Äù or, unfortunately, have already fallen for the tricks of crooks and lost money, please provide as much information as possible to the address indicated below <b>in Russian</b> : your operator, your mobile number, the date and time of the incident, a description of How did you get the offer to ‚Äúupdate‚Äù or ‚Äúinstall‚Äù Opera Mini, how did you withdraw money, a short SMS number to which you were asked to send a message, the amount - in general, all the information available. <br><br>  Address for messages - <b>fraudreport-ru (a) opera.com</b> <br><br>  <b>UPDATE</b> <br><br>  Unfortunately, not everyone understood exactly what to send to this address.  I explain.  Just send the address of phishing sites is <b>not necessary</b> , because  does not make sense.  All of them are already known, and we find new ones quite actively.  At this address you need to send information about the real cases of loss of money with a very detailed description, only then you can try to calculate the unscrupulous content provider.  This action is focused on the search for such providers.  I really hope for understanding. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/130029/">https://habr.com/ru/post/130029/</a></p>
