Coaches, coaches of personal effectiveness, and no matter how you call them - thousands of them, dubious middle-aged men, who organize seminars in provincial houses of culture and spamming with offers to go through Six Simple Steps Towards Awareness. <br><br>  Eco, I cursed them!  And because they are angry.  Not only are the bums and the charlatans themselves, they also take up the teachings.  He himself was not told: "500 people are sitting in the hall and repeat in chorus:" I believe in myself ... I believe in myself ... my strength is my wealth "."  Remember ‚Äú <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8_%25C2%25AB%25D0%2594%25D0%25B0%25C2%25BB">Always say yes</a> ‚Äù to Jim Carrey?

      In a word, Ostap Ibrahimovic is not on them, with his immortal ‚Äúdo not teach me how to live, better help financially‚Äù. <br><br>  On the other hand, it is a necessary thing.  A mature, experienced person, with the appropriate knowledge and desire to direct, help, suggest, through some internal ‚Äúgags‚Äù, to pull the scruff - go bad!  The spiritual father or the guru there, you understand, is not suitable for everyone.  And in life you want to understand, the good is your own, only one and inexorably moving towards the end. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/fbc2659c/d079df8b/fc6f96de/dd356277.jpg"><br><br>  In my hands the book ‚ÄúPower of Focus‚Äù, in the Russian version - ‚Äú <s>Bes the</s> <a href="http://mann-ivanov-ferber.ru/books/mif/ThePowerOfFocus/">Whole Life</a> ‚Äù.  Authors - kondovye, professional coaches.  However, the track record inspires respect: it flashes Sony, Virgin, CNN, Time, etc. Still, the temptation to quickly scroll through and postpone this book to the farthest regiment would have prevailed, if it were not abstract: <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúBooks that call for the meaning of life usually repel realistic and practical people with abstract ideas.  Is it possible to think about some high life goal, when your house is not tidied up, you need to take the car to the repair and the dog is not fed? ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  ‚ÄúWow,‚Äù I think, ‚Äúthis is a completely different conversation.‚Äù  I decided to read it all the same, it took about a week and a half from the calculation for a chapter a day on the way to work. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  ‚ÄúWhole life‚Äù teaches us to set goals and achieve them, thereby filling life with taste and meaning.  10 strategies, 10 lessons with exercises at the end of each.  Moreover, the whole sphere of human activity is covered: it is written about the power of habits, and about relationships with others, and about maintaining balance, and how to choose these very goals so as not to howl with anguish halfway through. <br><br>  That this book is a big plus - all the tips are practical and practical.  There is no stupid self-hypnosis a la "I am capable, I will achieve."  Of course, the proposal to write your goal on a piece of paper and put it in a prominent place sounds rather pathetic, but if it helps to distract from some garbage and get back to work - why not? <br><br>  Another thing is that I did not find anything new for myself.  Either he read somewhere (in particular, in the excellent book ‚Äú <a href="http://mann-ivanov-ferber.ru/books/paperbook/PFE/">Life at Full Power</a> ‚Äù by the same publishing house ‚ÄúMIF‚Äù), or he knew at the level of elementary common sense. <br><br>  I would give this book to a young lad who enters the world of adults ‚Äî or just entered and feels stunned by the variety of possibilities, conventions and nuances.  It does not hurt a more mature person who is confused in the life of no less than a young man, he has simply become accustomed.  Well, and those who laid out all that is possible, on the shelves and scoop to success - it is quite possible that they will inspire and refresh something in memory. <br><br>  PS There is a version that all this ‚Äúself-development‚Äù of Chukhnia is complete - they say, you need to work and live as you live, and everything will be OK.  I tried: very soon you ask yourself ‚Äúwhy the hell is all this?‚Äù, The soul asks for recharge ... As in the song: ‚ÄúI drank C <sub>2</sub> H <sub>5</sub> OH, sat down on the Niva Rostselmash ...‚Äù.  The result can be sad. <br><br>  <a href="http://mann-ivanov-ferber.ru/books/mif/ThePowerOfFocus/">Book page on the website of the publishing house Mann, Ivanov and Ferber</a> (there are excerpts in PDF, a selection of reviews) <br>  <a href="http://www.thepoweroffocus.ca/">Official website of the book</a> (in English) <br><br>  Reviews on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Power-Focus-Business-Financial-Certainty/dp/1558747524">Amazon</a> and <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/68986.The_Power_of_Focus%3F">Goodreads</a> on average give a <b>4 + / 5</b> book - the general tone is ‚Äúuseful, but trite.‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/116480/">https://habr.com/ru/post/116480/</a></p>
