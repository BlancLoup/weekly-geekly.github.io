  <section class="page js-page"><h1>AvePoint DocAve for SharePoint</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In this article I will try to review and give a brief description of some products from AvePoint for SharePoint <br><br>  <b>DocAve Administrator</b> <br>  DocAve 6 Administrator is a solution designed to centrally manage a farm (or several farms) of SharePoint 2010/2013, as well as Office 365. <br>  The solution allows you to perform almost all farm operations that can be performed in the SharePoint Central Administration (for example, create a web application and site collection, configure managed paths and security, and service application associations), but it facilitates working with many farms by providing a single administration console. <br>  Why almost all operations?  DocAve 6 Administrator does not allow to create and delete service applications - for this you will have to open the administration center.  I do not know how critical it is, but still I would like to have everything in one place. <br>  In addition to the standard functionality provided by SharePoint, DocAve 6 Administrator contains one, in my opinion, useful feature for administrators - deleting user accounts that are not in Active Directory.  This is a very useful thing because the built-in functionality does not allow you to do this even before to get rid of the old accounts I could only through export / import. <br>  Well and a bonus that all actions can be automated through the schedule. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>DocAve Connector</b> <br>  Opportunities: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Allows you to manage files on file servers via SharePoint without importing it into the content database. <br>  ‚Ä¢ It is installed as a feature and can be applied to a specific Web application. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Allows you to import permissions and metadata from file storage. <br>  A few words about document collaboration.  When opening for editing office documents via http, it is proposed to save the document to SharePoint.  At the same time, it enters the content base and does not change on the file ball.  When opening a document via UNC, there is no simultaneous access to the file - by design.  Actually, what was required to prove.  However, you can still achieve collaboration - Office Web Apps taxis. <br>  However, this solution does not quite behave correctly when using RBS (as with the use of a Microsoft provider or of its own).  What does not really mean?  When RBS is turned on, when you add a file to the library that is connected to the file storage, the document is added to both the ball and RBS.  It turns out unnecessary redundancy. <br>  Moreover, with the DocAve agent installed, I did not manage to use the standard RBS provider - he simply ignored the size specified in it.  The problem was solved when I used the provider from DocAve. <br><br>  <b>DocAve Replicator &amp; Contenet Manager</b> <br>  Two very interesting DocAve content synchronization products.  It allows one-way or two-way replication of content, configuration, permissions, and users both within the same farm and between farms, which is good with geo-distributed farms ‚Äî you can be sure that the content will be the same everywhere. <br>  Replication can be carried out either in real time (by event) or by schedule. <br>  Replication can be either full or differential.  Differential in turn can be file and byte (for slow channels). <br>  Content Manager <br>  Allows you to copy or transfer content, sites, and SharePoint topology, both within the same farm (between site collections) and between farms (including SharePoint Online) <br>  Most likely it uses the standard SharePoint functionality (Content deployment) with all its limitations, in particular, the standard functionality does not allow migrating workflows.  In Content Manager, workflow migrations are stated, but with limitations: Visual Studio Workflow and Visio Workflow, as well as Reusable workflows are not supported.  I have not earned the transfer of List Workflow between farms and between web applications. <br>  Also content deployment is a one-time action, i.e.  you can not set a schedule for the transfer, only the run time (now or at a certain time)

        </script>
      <br>
      In general, this is a good solution for content synchronization, but it is not clear why not to use the built-in SharePoint feature as Content Deployment. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/180347/">https://habr.com/ru/post/180347/</a></p>
