  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Quad Saga and HPE Storage</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The authoritative analytics of Gartner in the IT industry is perceived even by those who do not trust marketing statements at all.  This is especially true of reports in the Magic Quadrant format, which make it possible at a glance to understand what is happening in the relevant segment of the IT industry.  Let's look at recent publications on storage systems and on HPE offer evaluations, in particular, 3PAR and Nimble Storage with its analytic platform InfoSight. <br><br>  Let's start with the newest magic quadrant for general purpose arrays (‚ÄúMagic Quadrant for General-Purpose Disk Arrays‚Äù), published October 31, 2017.  It is publicly available <a href="https://www.gartner.com/doc/3817056/magic-quadrant-generalpurpose-disk-arrays">on the Gartner website</a> , and this is the case when a picture is worth a thousand words (which are also in the document, and describe each vendor individually). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kz/wn/5h/kzwn5hipvqkgtrhnqpmrlxqeyqk.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  HPE products (in this case, it is mainly about 3PAR and Nimble Storage, which is sold in Russia from November 1, 2017) are not just located in the leader quadrant.  They occupy the absolute first place in the market according to Gartner analysts.  The best position in the quadrant is in the upper right corner, and it means that the manufacturer surpasses its competitors both in the characteristics of its products (Completeness of Vision, horizontal axis) and in its abilities to deliver the developed technologies to consumers at an adequate price (Ability to Execute vertical axis).  Thus, Gartner considers the results of the work of the HPE development and sales team to be the best in the world. <br><br>  An important distinguishing feature of Nimble Storage products, ac January 2018 and HPE 3PAR, is the cloud service system InfoSight, about which we wrote <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/hpe/blog/329202/">earlier</a> .  According to IDC estimates, InfoSight is the industry-leading IT predictive analysis platform with an NPS 85 product quality index (Net Promoter Score can range from -100 to +100, the average for the storage industry is 15), and a sample for copying by other manufacturers.

      November 21, the first version of InfoSight has been <a href="https://news.hpe.com/hpe-brings-artificial-intelligence-to-the-data-center/">announced</a> since 2018 for new and existing HPE 3PAR StoreServ arrays with 3PAR OS 3.3.1.  All storage systems starting from the 3PAR StoreServ 7000 family that are supported will get access to InfoSight for free and automatically. <br><br>  The first version of HPE InfoSight for HPE 3PAR arrays has the following features: <br><br><ul><li>  VM stack analysis.  Allows system administrators to discover the root causes of performance problems with virtual machines using HPE 3PAR storage system resources.  This feature also allows you to detect "noisy" virtual machines that cause problems for other storage workloads. </li><li>  Global visualization.  New portal for visualization of trends in performance, capacity and bandwidth of 3PAR arrays. </li><li>  Base for predictive support.  Creation of base modules for detecting hardware problems and software errors, and automating the transfer of service cases to system software developers without the need to interact with the first level of telephone and email support. </li></ul><br>  More details about InfoSight and the Nimble Storage portfolio can be found <a href="https://gateway.on24.com/wcc/gateway/elitehpeemeademandgen/1474757/1533551/%3Fpartnerref%3Dhabrahabr">on the webinar</a> , which will be held today and will be available on record. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.gartner.com/doc/reprints%3Fid%3D1-4686TMS%26ct%3D170714%26st%3Dsb">Another Gartner Magic Quadrant was</a> published on July 13, 2017, and is dedicated to arrays entirely built on the basis of flash memory.  In this quadrant, HPE is also in the leader group.  Although this is not an absolute first place, but pay attention - the products of Hewlett Packard Enterprise are the same, 3PAR and Nimble Storage.  Unlike other manufacturers, HPE provides full technological compatibility of hybrid arrays and all-flash systems within the Nimble Storage and 3PAR families. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/r1/3j/p8/r13jp85k1birog72atgwm93o4aw.png"><br><br>  The position of vendors in this quadrant raises many questions.  For example, why does the Dell EMC rank higher than HPE in this quadrant along the ‚ÄúAbility to Execute‚Äù axis compared to the ‚ÄúMagic Quadrant for General-Purpose Disk Arrays‚Äù?  Nimble and 3PAR technology are the same, pricing, marketing, and people interacting with customers are the same.  Ratings are different.  On the axis of the Completeness of Vision "Dell EMC and HPE almost the same level.  However, in the description, Gartner mentions the problems of the Dell EMC solution portfolio: <br><br><ul><li>  Repositioning XtremIO from the main universal solid-state array to niche players in the VDI market; </li><li>  Termination of sales of the flagship product DSSD; </li><li>  Repainting of traditional architecture arrays in all-flash; </li><li>  Incompatibility of technology and management tools; </li></ul><br>  However, no conclusions are made for the position of the vendor in the leader quadrant. <br>  In the case of the Pure position is still more difficult.  Together with the magic quadrant, Gartner released the document "Critical Capabilities for Solid-State Arrays."  In all five storage utilization scenarios (transaction processing, server virtualization, desktop virtualization, high performance computing, analytics), Nimble Storage arrays received significantly higher marks compared to Pure Storage analogues, and 3PAR was second to Pure only in the VDI nomination. <br><br>  Victories in MQ and high market shares indicate that Hewlett Packard Enterprise has chosen the right strategy for the storage industry.  Instead of keeping in its portfolio a dozen different hardware platforms aimed at the same segments, HPE seeks to emphasize compatibility and strong offerings in every market segment.  Extending InfoSight from the Nimble Storage line to HPE 3PAR arrays is an example of acquisition synergy with 1 + 1 = 3. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/342888/">https://habr.com/ru/post/342888/</a></p>
