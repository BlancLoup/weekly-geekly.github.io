Customer Relationship Management."</b>  <b>Practical conference in the format "developer-client" was held</b> <b><a name="habracut"></a><br></b>  <b>On October 25, the first Practical Conference “Simple Business 2012. Customer Relationship Management” was held at the Central House of Entrepreneur.</b>  <b>The conference was held by a cloud service development company for automating <a href="http://www.prostoy.ru/">“Simple Business” business</a> processes with the support of the Moscow Young Entrepreneurs Club, the Moscow Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Russian Association of Electronic Communications and the Business Factory.</b> <b><br></b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e9c/9fb/9c1/e9c9fb9c164e5e9c59286944e072d78a.jpg" alt="image"><br>  “Today, entrepreneurs are faced with the question of choosing the optimal CRM, however, not everyone can imagine the possibilities of automation systems.  Many business owners have unjustified stereotypes about the unavailability of such systems and the large time spent on their implementation.  A clear demonstration of the capabilities of the “Simple Business” system proved that this is not so.  The conference allowed us to get feedback from the business and many interesting suggestions for improving the system.  We believe that this is how business automation should develop today, ”said Vasily Vasilenko, director for special projects at Simple Business. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0bb/d17/515/0bbd17515a63d603ad21beffe3badb6c.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The conference was attended by those organizations that are only going to automate the business, and those who are already using automation, but are seeking to increase its efficiency.  Many entrepreneurs watched the conference online broadcast. <br>  <b>Automate or lose</b> <br>  The reports were presented directly by analysts and developers of the “Simple Business” system, so they were able to give practical recommendations on using CRM as a company strategy.  In particular, the developers gave applied answers that most interested participants: they told how to automate work with personnel, maintain a customer base and sales, organize communications with little or no cost, generate electronic document flow, keep accounts and records, and how using Simple Business CMS create a website in 5 minutes. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9b2/0a2/a3d/9b20a2a3d3f3fcc555c31cef2dc8bec8.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Customers who have been using the system for a long time, note that with proper organization of all workflows, automation can reduce many items of expenditure by 30% within a month after implementation. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8d9/256/8ee/8d92568ee310d399ff0a98635fdc7184.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Three new Metro-style products were presented at the conference: a system version with a launchpad in this style, a Simple Business portal in Metro style with horizontal scrolling and a web version of the system. <br>  One of the goals of the conference is to receive not only feedback, but also proposals directly from entrepreneurs on the development of new functions for “Simple Business”.  The authors of the most creative ideas received prizes from the organizers - Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 tablets. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8b9/56a/213/8b956a21307f163f1d75c438827dc59d.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b>At the end of the conference, the Awards Ceremony for the winners of the All-Russian <a href="http://www.prostoy.ru/events/konkurs/">Journalism Competition “Just About the Difficult,”</a> dedicated to the selection of the best materials about small business and youth entrepreneurship in Russia, took place.</b> <b><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f83/8b2/1be/f838b21beab71d552a07a1a2b463c7d3.jpg" alt="image"></b> <br>  Organizers of the competition <a href="http://www.prostoy.ru/">"Simple Business"</a> and <a href="http://fabrika-biznesa.ru/">"Factory of Business"</a> .
