And to be surprised there really is something - not everyone knows about WiMAX itself, and even more so about the fact that Yota recently launched a mobile WiMAX-WiFi router for sale in the form of ... yes, its dear.

      The box is white and blue, in the form of a small cube. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/62b/baf/9a3/62bbaf9a37e83680aac9bfabcdcf5f73.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Having removed the ‚Äúcover‚Äù of the box, we get two identical ‚Äúprisms‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9de/6b5/067/9de6b50670cea2cc0f4fe0148f76be91.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The first is a remarkable white adapter, on one side of which there is a plug in the socket, on the other - a USB port.  It is logical then to assume that the egg will work from the network, but over a single wire (USB).  Actually, this particular wire is also located in the first part of the box.  It is also white, on its reverse side there is a narrow oblong connector, which often used to be found on mobile phones and I recently met on the <b><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/54995/">Nexx NMP-280</a></b> player.  In addition to this wire, the kit also comes with a Y-shaped wire (one end goes to the "soap", the other two, usb, to the laptop).  It allows you to recharge the modem from the laptop, if there is no power outlet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a5f/a34/66e/a5fa3466e92533fb79d89c2671dda7a3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  What is in the second "prism"?  I get an egg (out of the box), a user manual (20 pages), and a brief user manual (1 page) for drumming.  Everything. <br>  Manual at a good level - in addition to the materiel, there are all the necessary instructions. <br><br><h2>  Appearance </h2><br>  What can I say ... unusual!  ) The dimensions are about the same as those of a mobile phone, but the shape of the device itself is unusual - really something new in the design of devices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/65a/2ec/18f/65a2ec18f958114a83d808dfe9f2a805.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  If you look at the top of the egg, you can see the logo and a lot of holes of two sizes around the perimeter, I barely counted - 92 pieces. <br>  At one end you can see the connector hidden by the latch where the USB cable is connected.  From the other end there are three points-diode - WiMAX, Wi-Fi and charge indicator. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c90/b37/e2a/c90b37e2a0572d2d0a3705d7ee17315d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/795/38b/fea/79538bfea646afdecba1e3647ed1a2a7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the reverse side are two arched rubber feet, a sticker, a power button, a ‚Äúpoint‚Äù Reset and another 70 holes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0a9/c15/35e/0a9c1535e7909ba428eccb9f0c65cd57.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  If there was not a Nuf man drawn on the lid, but a bitten apple, I am sure that real fans might have noticed the substitution, but they would definitely be confused) <br>  The simpler the item, the harder it is to break it and the more reliable it is.  Sometimes it seems that this is not an egg, but a stone (‚Äú... from the coast of Koktebel‚Äù is so dreamy about vacation), which can be worn anywhere and in any way ‚Äî there‚Äôs nothing to break, in the worst case, it will be just rubbing. <br><br><h2>  Turn on and work </h2><br>  Hold the "at the bottom" button for 4 seconds and voila - the egg comes to life.  The WiMAX indicator lights up - the modem is trying to catch the network.  Wi-Fi is always ready for work and defense.  The last power indicator shows battery charge.  Yes, yes, the gusto of the device is that it is autonomous!  Charge via USB and you can go back home (with benefit within coverage).  But the very fact of being able to work from the outlet adds advantages. <br><br>  Being in the network zone, the modem will immediately connect to it - we activate on the site and after the next power-up, you can enjoy the Internet.  More precisely, you first need to turn on Wi-Fi on a laptop or where else ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1c2/5fc/219/1c25fc219b6a01996f5df99e94fbde8d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The admin is located at <b>192.168.1.1</b> - in principle, there is nothing unusual in it.  This, of course, is not a full routing, but still.  Wireless settings, port mapping, WiMAX connection information and firmware upgrade page. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/268/d2d/896/268d2d89670356fb6089ae2411a1b3b0.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a60/a76/7df/a60a767df3c4b119678935eb019863f1.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b8e/6a7/b26/b8e6a7b26f7bb57bc15c19b51e553c86.png" alt="image"><br><br>  When working, the egg is slightly heated, but does not seem to sweat) Measurement of speed, the screenshot of which is below, was carried out in a bus in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãKuzminki metro station, but the same picture is used in the center. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8d3/1a0/289/8d31a0289e2d7c1c75f62e483f913304.png" alt="image"><br><br>  I think it's super. <br><br><h2>  Specifications </h2><br>  <b>Technical name</b> : iWWR-1000R <br>  <b>Model</b> : Yota Egg <br>  <b>Use time (with full charge)</b> - with continuous use up to 4 hours, in standby mode up to 6 hours. <br><br>  <u><b>WiMAX</b></u> : <br>  <b>Technology Standard</b> : IEEE 802.16e-2005 <br>  <b>Frequency range</b> : 2.5-2.7 GHz <br>  <b>Signal power</b> : 200 mW <br><br>  <u><b>Wi-Fi</b></u> : <br>  <b>Technological standard</b> : IEEE 802.11b / g <br>  <b>Frequency range</b> : 2.4 GHz <br>  <b>Signal power</b> : 10 mW <br><br>  <b>Battery</b> : 3.7V, 2800mA / h. <br>  <b>Antenna</b> : built-in antenna <br>  <b>Dimensions</b> : 110 √ó 61.8 √ó 28.3 mm <br>  <b>Weight</b> : 130 grams <br>  <b>Working temperature</b> : -20 ¬∞ ~ + 50 ¬∞ C. <br>  <b>Input voltage</b> : 100-240V ~ 50 / 60Hz <br>  <b>Output voltage</b> : DC + 5V 2A <br><br><h2>  How much is the eggs for the people? </h2><br>  <b><u>pros</u></b> <br>  - Compact size, light weight - can be carried in your pocket; <br>  - High-quality assembly, nice appearance, functional display; <br>  - Ability to work offline; <br>  - Easy to set up and use; <br>  - A good signal. <br><br>  <b><u>Minuses</u></b> <br>  - A short battery life (50 hours would be ...); <br>  - Non-standard connector; <br>  - Price (as in advertising - 5990 rubles); <br><br>  <b>In this model, surprised</b> : unusual shape, ease of use <br>  <b>Advice to the manufacturer</b> : invest in the development of fuel cells;) and continue to do a good thing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c45/876/2f5/c458762f59c18ab8590c3e6d52680cf7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  the end </h2><br>  If there is an opportunity to work from the network, then for students it is just a godsend.  No power outlet?  Any laptop will come to the rescue, from which battery the egg will always be able to bite off on ‚Äúeat‚Äù  In any case, the fuse is stable enough for two couples at the institute, and ‚Äúfor all‚Äù. <br>  The price is like a good level ‚Äúadult‚Äù router - apparently, this is a fee just for mobility and for ‚Äújust appeared‚Äù.  Although again - you can throw off the group and there will be no problem.  I‚Äôm already imagining ‚ÄúSanya, let me pay a whit for you in October, and you start cursing for me‚Äù :) <br>  A uniquely useful device with a pleasant design, made in the best traditions ... And if earlier you had to spend one USB port for a modem on a laptop without a WiMAX module, now you can sit on the Internet from any device without getting eggs from your pocket.  I think this is a good plus for a mobile person. <br>  I shake Yota's crab - I like their ads all over Moscow, they like the ease of use and the speed at which you can work almost anywhere, you like the prices of these services.
