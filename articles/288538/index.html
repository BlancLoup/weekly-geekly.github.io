  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Blog Review # 28</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><habracut text="  #28">  The first snow fell and bloggers were the first to report this to the world.  How can snow fall and not get on the pages of several million blogs?  Unthinkable situation!  Snow-covered blogs sparkle from the screens of monitors and dazzle Internet users.  So, winter is coming, the New Year, Christmas decorations, the smell of tangerine, confetti litter. <br><br>  Perhaps the main event of the past week was the launch of Six Apart, a new platform for bloggers called <a href="http://www.vox.com/">Vox</a> .  Let me remind you that Six Apart is the owner of the most popular among Russian-speaking users of the livejournal.com service.  There is a logical question: then why another platform?  The fact is that, first and foremost, Vox is designed for people aged 25 years and older, because teenagers mostly use the livejournal in America, and only here it has become a kind of cult among the Internet intelligentsia.  Therefore, with the launch of the new service, Six Apart is planning to conquer a more adult audience.  In fact, there are no fundamental differences from the livejournal.  A more advanced security system, you can publish not only text, but also video / audio data.  A powerful keyword search as well as convenient import tools from other web services, such as YouTube, have been created.  Let's see what will happen next. <br><br>  We in Belarus are waiting for the launch of the service from TUT.BY.  After two weeks of correspondence, <strong>Kirill Voloshin</strong> on behalf of tut.by allowed him to publish some information about the new service of the portal for maintaining his own blogs.  Our correspondence in question-answer format: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <em>How long will the testing of your new service last?</em>  <em>When should we expect to launch it?</em> <br><br>  From a month to three and the one and the other. <br><br>  <em>Why did you decide to choose WordPress as the engine for your service?</em> <br><br>  He is free and heaped :). <br><br>  <em>So you did not pay for this ‚Äúengine‚Äù?</em>  <em>But a WordPress multiuser license is paid, did you somehow bypass it?</em> <br><br>  A single-user version is used in our system.  That is, one WordPress process is actually launched, and there are a lot of addresses (user diaries) in this process. <br>  <i>What is the main difference between your blogging service and many similar ones?</i>  <i>That is the main highlight that highlights it?</i> <br><br>  The main highlight is the engine, which provides wider possibilities, as compared to, for example, livejournal.com.  At the same time, compared to the original WordPress, the process of creating a blog is significantly simplified - there is no need to buy hosting, upload scripts to the server, and mess around with the configuration settings.  Also, do not forget about the possibilities of TUT.BY for integrating blogs with other portal services - ‚ÄúPhoto‚Äù, ‚ÄúForums‚Äù, ‚ÄúNews‚Äù, as well as their promotion.  For example, it is planned to display links to popular author diaries in the news, as well as on the first page of the portal.  And finally, the users of our blogs will receive Belarusian addresses for posting their diaries. <br><br>  <em>Let's at least take the Belarusian inf.by/blog for comparison.</em>  <em>Do you think there is a shortage of blogging services in Belarus?</em> <br><br>  Belarusian and with the Belarusian domain - not enough, of course! <br><br>  <em>Is this the main reason?</em> <br><br>  The main reason is that TUT.BY is a Belarusian portal.  And our task is to provide Belarusian users with a maximum of various services of interest to them, without taking them from Bynet and from the portal, in particular. <br><br>  <em>The appearance of your service and blog search on Akavita (blogs.akavita.by) is a mere coincidence or a carefully planned enslavement of the world?</em> <br><br>  :)) We are planning to enslave the world, opening a blog search on Akavita with the ‚Äúleakage‚Äù of rumors about blog.tut.by is a coincidence. <br><br>  <em>Will we see the corporate blog tut.by in the near future, where informal photos of Yuri Ziser will be laid out?</em> <br><br>  I'm afraid to lay out something special and nothing.  Yuri in the life of the informal is not very different from himself in the public life.  In a good context, of course.  Rather, it will be his and our thoughts, rather than photos. <br>  <i>That is the corporate blog tut.by still planned?</i>  <i>And when will we see him?</i>  <i>Then when will you start the blogging service?</i> <br><br>  The corporate blog is planned to be opened not earlier than the diaries service will be launched. <br><br>  Well, I received complete and frank answers that fully satisfied my curiosity.  We look forward to starting blog.tut.by! <br><br>  There is also a lively discussion on the purchase of rights to manage the Cyrillic part of the most popular blog in Russia - LiveJournal, or, in Russian, LJ, by the company "Soup".  I bring to your attention the <a href="http://www.expert.ru/printissues/thing/2006/08/gromov">opinion of</a> Andrei Gromov from the Expert site.  It is interesting, above all, the economic approach: "And what, in fact, bought?".  Here is a quote: "... I bought‚Äú Soup ‚Äùnot this, but something else - the rights to dispose of 648 thousand people and sell them. 648 thousand registered souls. And for some reason I don‚Äôt like this type of business at all.‚Äù <br><br>  In continuation of the topic, utro.ru investigates the likelihood of the existence of ‚Äú <a href="http://www.utro.ru/articles/2006/10/30/596974.shtml">blacklists</a> ‚Äù, allegedly ‚ÄúSoup‚Äù has a list of four thousand diaries in LiveJournal that will be removed for stirring up international passions, xenophobia and fascist sentiments.  Moreover, there are also rumors about the introduction of pre-moderation.  In this article, the guide "Soup" denies all these rumors.  By the way, I hope that in the next issue of ‚ÄúThe World of Blogs‚Äù there will be exclusive comments by Anton Nosik about this whole orgy. <br><br>  <b>And at this time ...</b> <b><br></b> <br>  ... a Greek blogger paid with freedom for criticizing a TV host.  Greek police arrested a blogger for sharp criticism of TV presenter Dimosthenis Lyakkoulous.  The RSS-aggregator belonging to the arrested Antonis Tsipropoulus contained a link to the record where a certain author accuses the TV presenter of lack of professionalism and anti-Semitism.  The offended TV worker complained about the abuser to the police, after which Tsipropoulus was detained, <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/10/30/greek_blogger_arrested">according</a> to The Register.  It is noteworthy that the record that caused the disturbance of the TV host was posted on the blog FunEL, which is hosted in the USA, and the arrested person is the administrator of another site - <a href="http://www.blogme.gr/">www.blogme.gr</a> , which is just an aggregator, that is, it collects and shows RSS feeds from other sites.  That is, the person was arrested for someone else's record! <br><br>  ... Iran‚Äôs President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad started <a href="http://www.ahmadinejad.ir/">his own blog</a> , <a href="http://www.delo.ua/ru/news/11767.html">according to the</a> newspaper Delo.  The first blog entry, beginning with the words ‚Äúin the name of Allah, the Almighty and All Compassionate,‚Äù is dedicated to the biography of the Iranian leader.  ‚ÄúIn those days, when nobility was considered still a virtue and the greatest blessing was considered life in a city, I was born into a poor family in a distant village in Hamsar,‚Äù Ahmadinejad told the first visitors of his diary.  The appearance of the Iranian President‚Äôs diary did not go unnoticed, and soon Israeli hackers deprived all Ahmadinejad fans of the site for a whole day.  Now the blog is working fine. <br><br>  ... probably in response, a new public relations department is being created at the Pentagon that will deal with the outreach of the war in Iraq.  The main objectives of this service will be to combat inaccurate information disseminated by both electronic and traditional media.  At the same time, special attention will be paid to Internet blogs, <a href="http://www.peacekeeper.ru/%3Fmid%3D2442">reports the</a> independent informational review Russian Peacemaker. <br><br>  ... <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International International has</a> called on bloggers from around the world to stand up to defend freedom of speech on the Internet.  The human rights organization believes that fundamental human rights, especially freedom of speech and privacy, are threatened by governments that want to control what their citizens are talking about and what information they have access to, <a href="http://www.itnovosti.ru/amnesty-issues-call-bloggers">according to</a> ITNews. <br><br>  That's it for today, love blogs. <br><br>  <b>Alexey Kaletsky</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://crazyhamster.livejournal.com/180144.html">crazyhamster.livejournal.com/180144.html</a> <br>  <a href="http://kv.by/index2006440601.htm">Published in "Computer News" (‚Ññ44, 2006)</a> </habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288538/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288538/</a></p>
