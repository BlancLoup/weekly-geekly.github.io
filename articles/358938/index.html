As a rule, a rather adequate speech follows, just a person is shy of simple questions.  And do not be shy - because each of us can not know absolutely everything.  There are professionals in various fields, in order to clarify even what they themselves seem obvious. <br><br>  We collected 40 of the most common questions about CRM-systems and decided to answer them all at once.  Of course, we are not insane optimists to believe that the flow will run out after this.  Yes and no such goal.  But if you didn‚Äôt know and were afraid to ask - read, save, use.  Only question-answer, no lyrics. <br><br> <a href="https://habr.com/company/regionsoft/blog/358938/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7b7/7ea/84d/7b77ea84d268626985ccde0983103e3d.png"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  <b>Table of contents</b> </h3><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">A list of questions for easy navigation</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <b><a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/regionsoft/blog/358938/">Block 1.

The essence of CRM-systems </h1><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b4e/0c6/0fb/b4e0c60fb78a114bcde1dae42913c3a1.png" width="350"></div><br><a name="1"></a><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">What is CRM?</font> </h3><br>  A question that never ceases to be asked everywhere and which is very difficult to answer without a scientific and technical conceptual apparatus.  Briefly and humanly, CRM is a program that performs part of the routine work, stores records and customer base, helps to prepare reports, segment the base and build marketing solutions, build relationships with customers.  This is not just a program for sales, it is not a notebook, it is a full-fledged universal software (tool) that can help you improve and simplify operational customer relationship management, thereby increasing profits.  Although each business defines CRM based on its goals. <br><br>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/regionsoft/blog/338918/">And a detailed answer to this question.</a> <br><br><a name="2"></a><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">What is the main feature of CRM?</font> </h3><br>  Each CRM has its own chip and for each company in CRM it has its own.  Someone valuable business processes, someone - planners, but for someone CRM without a warehouse - useless software.  But if to take as a whole, the main feature of the CRM system should be the connectedness of entities and the ability to work ‚Äúfrom any place of the program‚Äù.  For example, you create a transaction and find out that the subject of the transaction was not included in the nomenclature.  Ideally, if you do not need to close the window and go to the "Nomenclature" section, you can create the missing card from the point where you are.  It's comfortable. <br><br>  And of course, modern CRM simply should not exist if there are no business processes in it - the ability to maximally automate the routine in the office and finally get rid of the influence of the human factor.  This is the cornerstone of business automation.  As well as small companies should not turn away from business processes.  Once they start to introduce - and the work will be significantly more pleasant, faster and more transparent.  And to achieve this result, we need not cameras behind the back of the employee, not time-trackers of working time, but well-established business processes.  Alas, Russian entrepreneurs are moving too slowly towards this idea, and they could have done to their competitors at the expense of technological maturity. <br><br>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/regionsoft/blog/354176/">Detailed and simple language about business processes</a> <br><br><a name="3"></a><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">1C and CRM - is it the same thing?</font> </h3><br>  No, not at all.  1C in the conventional sense - a set of software products for business automation.  First of all, the products of the company 1C are designed to automate accounting, payroll, inventory, etc. Including, 1C has products with CRM elements.  A separate CRM system is always basically based on the operational management and customer relationship management with its special tools. <br><br><a name="4"></a><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">CRM 1C is not needed?</font> </h3><br>  Is needed.  These are different programs.  You can configure the data exchange between the CRM-system and 1C, or make a deep integration.  By the way, if a vendor declares that integration with 1C is ‚Äúout of the box‚Äù, ‚Äúon the fly‚Äù, ‚Äúa couple of clicks‚Äù, this is a marketing lie and we are talking about a possible data exchange (and even then, if it is technically possible).  Integration with 1C is a difficult, costly and not always justified business; it is necessary to analyze your needs and understand what level of integration is really needed. <br><br><h1><a name="b2"></a>  Block 2. Functional features of CRM-systems </h1><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/639/9b6/dff/6399b6dffff2bec8761dcfc3ef402f5d.jpg" width="200"></div><br><a name="5"></a><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Why are there so many functions in some CRM systems?</font> </h3><br>  This is a specific question that most often sounds relatively large CRM-systems.  We are often confronted with it - because our CRM is crammed with features and features just like a spaceship (especially in older editions).  In fact, each company, starting to automate with simple data entry into customer cards and events, quickly mastered and comes to use the vast majority of functions.  Therefore, there is almost no excess in the interface - the more opportunities you use, the more positive the result of using the program will be. <br><br>  By the way, this whole set of functions is not the implementation of the entire backlog "as it is", but the most tried and tested and requested features.  That is, the answer to the requests of companies like yours, ours and many others. <br><br><a name="6"></a><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Does CRM work with Google Calendar?</font> </h3><br>  In some CRM-systems, there is integration with the Google calendar, in some there isn‚Äôt.  This is due only to the presence of requests from users - if there is demand, the vendor certainly implements it.  We have no integration with Google calendar in the CRM system, as with any other calendars, and there are a number of reasons for this (I think the position of other developers has not gone far from ours). <br><br><ol><li>  Security considerations.  Yet Google services are cloudy, and the calendar inside them is quite vulnerable, especially if you consider that employees can even access a corporate account from any portable gadget, forget to log in, clear data, etc.  Agree, it is foolish to host reliable CRM on your own servers and throw all meetings and customer contacts into an insecure external environment. <br></li><li>  Accessibility considerations.  Unfortunately, recently cloud services may show instability for reasons beyond their control (which we have been observing for several weeks already).  The business environment should be stable. <br></li><li>  Considerations of functionality.  When three types of scheduler are built in the CRM system (group, personal and three weeks with a planning horizon), it is easy to receive notifications and reminders, set tasks and manage them, operate with fields using the drag &amp; drop mechanism (dragging with a mouse), there is no need for an external service. <br></li></ol><br><a name="7"></a><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Do you have a sales funnel?</font> </h3><br>  Sales funnel - the simplest tool that is in almost all self-respecting CRM-systems.  But it is extremely important for the main users - the commercial service and management.  Therefore, when choosing a system, pay attention not so much to the presence of a funnel, but to its settings, parameters and the ability to view by manager, date, product, etc.  That is really not implemented at all.  Today, the priority is not the fact of having a sales funnel, but its customizability and flexibility. <br><br>  It should also be understood that the analysis of the sales funnel is relevant only if the analysis includes stream data of sufficient volume.  If there are 7 calls, 3 meetings and 1 transaction in your funnel, then such a funnel will play the role of statistics rather than data for analyzing and setting up a sales system. <br><br><a name="8"></a><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Should CRM be friends with social networks?</font> </h3><br>  Again, the opinions of market participants are divided: some use social networks for lead generation and integration, others just do not receive such an order from a pool of customers (we, for example).  There are several reasons for this range of opinions. <br><br><ol><li>  Main reason.  Sales through social networks is the prerogative of the B2C segment, and a very small business: flowers, home cooking, jewelry, network cosmetics, nutritional supplements, inexpensive clothing, hand-made goods, primitive trainers, and so on.  The entrepreneurs of this group have extremely low requirements for the CRM system and they will always find a niche simple product integrated with social networks.  A larger business does not use this path, so there are no such requests. <br></li><li>  Many CRM developers declare integration with social networks as a marketing feature, but, in fact, it is rarely used.  It's just that such integration costs almost nothing - popular APIs have a cool API and integration is literally sawn on the knee. <br></li><li>  Social networks lose their advertising appeal and get banner and contextual blindness - more and more content begins to solve. <br></li><li>  It is not always ethical to take lead data from social networks, although from a legal point of view it is not forbidden. <br></li></ol><br>  We, as an advertiser, have repeatedly tried to work with all the top social networks, but the result is one - it is a merged money.  We think the B2B segment has also understood this for a long time. <br><br><a name="9"></a><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">If CRM is not cloudy, I will not be able to use it anywhere except the office?</font> </h3><br>  This is a common and gross misconception.  CRM is organized like this: a central repository (database server, for example, in the main office) and user work applications (DBMS + interface).  If you have a cloud-based CRM system and do not have an Internet connection, then in most cases you will not be able to work locally.  If you have a desktop CRM system, you can also work anywhere, anytime.  Moreover, you can work in CRM even without a mobile application, right in the interface - using RDP (Remote Desktop Access) technology. <br><br><a name="10"></a><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Can you call from CRM?</font> </h3><br>  Yes, almost all CRM systems have integration capabilities with IP telephony.  Telephony in CRM can be implemented in several ways. <br><br><ol><li>  Integration with an IP-telephony provider using a widget or addon - you use the service and the interface of a third party - a telephony provider.  Used in simple CRM systems. <br></li><li>  Integration with a virtual PBX Asterisk - a common and popular form of telephony in CRM.  You can make calls directly from CRM and at the same time receive the full range of services from the VATS: conference call, call waiting and transfer, short numbers, etc.  We in RegionSoft CRM chose this method, and some time ago we created the VoIP Connector - incoming call routing server for our CRM.  He has significantly expanded telephony capabilities in our CRM system.  Also RegionSoft VoIP Connector allows you to integrate with most of the popular modern cloud PBX. <br></li><li>  Telephony includes CRM.  Recently, an obvious trend that has already received two variants of the development of events: a) the IP-telephony provider is developing its own CRM (or using a ready-made solution under its own brand) and declares that it is the CRM vendor;  b) the cellular operator acts in the same way and offers ‚Äúits‚Äù CRM in the package of services for corporate clients.  Both options are quite expensive, in both CRM is weak - a developed CRM system with many functions and entities is extremely difficult to quickly fit into such a business model. <br></li><li>  The ‚Äúzakhardkorzhenny‚Äù module of calls, tied to a specific IP-telephony operator - you can call only on the conditions and tariffs of the vendor.  In modern solutions almost never occurs. <br></li></ol><br>  Please note that calls are recorded and saved in CRM - this way you will be able to control the quality of customer service, resolve conflicts and train employees with real-world examples. <br><br><a name="11"></a><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Does the client card rise when you call?</font> </h3><br>  This is one of the top issues faced by the vendor.  Almost always - yes, the card rises, and the manager can see who is calling and get quick access to information on the client.  In fact, this is very important - this is how you demonstrate customer focus. <br><br><a name="12"></a><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">CRM considers salary?</font> </h3><br>  The accountant considers the salary all the same, using 1C for this, but CRM gives maximum data for bonuses and depreciation of employees: KPI, sales funnel reports, plan-actual analysis, etc.  An employee working in the interface of our system can not only get the result after the fact, but also control the dynamics of performance of indicators and redistribute time and effort to more priority tasks. <br><br><a name="13"></a><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Can I write letters in the CRM-system?</font> </h3><br>  Yes, in some (in particular, in <a href="http://www.regionsoft.ru/">RegionSoft CRM</a> ) it is possible - moreover, you can make group mailings, typeset letters in HTML, save templates, etc.  It is very convenient: all correspondence is associated with the client card and you do not need to search through the mailbox, just look at the letters for a specific client.  Some CRM email clients work on the basis of Gmail, or there is integration with the mailing service, or mail goes in one direction - be sure to check this question with the vendor, mail trouble is the worst of the surprises that may occur after implementation. <br><br><a name="14"></a><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">How to put primary documents in CRM?</font> </h3><br>  Shove them will not work, of course.  But there are three main options: <br><br><ol><li>  They are already in CRM (for example, in our RegionSoft CRM they are, starting with the editions of Professional and Professional Plus).  In this case, all that the manager needs is to generate documents with one button, selecting the right client and the necessary goods / services.  Plus, we support updating of forms of primary documentation in accordance with federal legislation. <br></li><li>  They are not in CRM, but there are special paid programs - connectors that allow you to create a primary CRM.  As a rule, such a realization is provided by the largest foreign vendors and made by the forces of Russian integrators.  Minus one - you need to pay more for the connector. <br></li><li>  Document generation in CRM is not and is not expected - in this case, it remains to do everything by hand.  Finalizing the document generation module is too expensive for one customer to be able to pay. <br></li></ol><br>  Therefore, if any types of primary documentation are especially important to you, discuss this issue with the vendor before implementation, in order not to waste time and not regret about the acquired software. <br><br><a name="b3"></a><h1>  Block 3. CRM systems security issues </h1><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/967/0ec/da8/9670ecda8203baefa053c4da424bf610.jpg" width="350"></div><br><a name="15"></a><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Is CRM watching me?</font> </h3><br>  CRM does not have built-in technical capabilities to track the actions of users outside the CRM itself (in any case, RegionSoft CRM).  That is, the system logs everything that you do inside it (generate reports, create clients, enter tasks, etc.), but there are no mechanisms to control employee actions outside of CRM: neither the ability to turn on the camera, nor the built-in keylogger, nor the Internet monitoring service traffic.  We are generally opposed to such methods and are convinced that motivation and self-control lie at the heart of the employee‚Äôs discipline.  Yes, and not intended for CRM such purposes.  CRM logs actions, records conversations with clients, logs business processes ‚Äî that is, records exclusively what is relevant to work and can play a decisive role in quality control and building a retrospective of the conflict. <br><br><a name="16"></a><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">The head sees all my actions?</font> </h3><br>  Above, we partially answered this question.  The head sees what relates to the main activity and sales: reports on managers, KPI, sales funnel, conducts a plan-factual analysis.  Believe me, the figures of operational reporting speak about the work of an employee much more eloquently than the logs of visited sites or the camera behind his back.

This is if from the point of view of us, techies. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And if you approach salespeople from the point of view, everything depends on the model and level of sales in the company: of course, for successful work you need a sales funnel, reports, a complete transaction card with documents, business processes, marketing analysis, segmentation, etc. This is not in all CRM, so you should familiarize yourself with the functionality in advance. We are periodically attacked by sales trainers and outraged, as we are in our </font></font><a href="http://www.regionsoft.ru/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">RegionSoft CRM</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">did not provide a SPIN-sale, a three-tier model, another model of sales organization. This, of course, is all from their non-technical mind, from the focus on the sales process and the inability to handle the data. In essence, a CRM system is a data warehouse with an interface, and if you have the professional ability to link your strategy with numbers, you can find information in the system for any sales model and sell more and more successfully. You will never find a CRM called ‚Äúfor long sales‚Äù or ‚Äúfor telephone sales‚Äù (unless as a marketing ploy) - managers are given a tool, not an electronic copy of the strategy and not a robot seller. In fact, almost all systems for the b2b market are designed for long sales, and those who have a telemarketer interface for telemarketing.That is, attributing CRM to any one narrow type of sales is simply strange.</font></font><br><br><a name="21"></a><h3> <font color="#cc0000"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What CRM is suitable for small business?</font></font></font> </h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is no definite answer. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What is commonly called a small business in business use </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">is a micro enterprise </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">in accordance with the </font></font><a href="http://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_52144/08b3ecbcdc9a360ad1dc314150a6328886703356/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">law</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It all depends on the scale and requirements of a particular organization. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, most often CRM for small business is a classic set of functionality: customers, transactions, primary documentation, reports (including a sales funnel), integration with telephony, basic data exchange with 1C. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the future, when scaling up a business, you can expand your CRM system, but it is better to learn about this opportunity in advance from the vendor. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The difference may be in price, and significant: for example, in our </font></font><a href="https://habr.com/company/regionsoft/blog/354176/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">RegionSoft CRM</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are several editions and, if necessary, you can expand licenses to more ‚Äúadult‚Äù options, and some popular cloud vendors need to change the whole model or expand by connecting numerous paid widgets. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you are at a loss with the choice of the editorial board or a set of modules / widgets / addons, start with the basic version - while working with the CRM system you will understand what you are missing and do not overpay for unnecessary functionality. </font></font><br><br> <a href="https://habr.com/company/regionsoft/blog/317124/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How to choose a small business CRM</font></font></a> <br><br><a name="22"></a><h3> <font color="#cc0000"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Do you have a CRM for ...

Such requests are not uncommon, so some vendors deploy marketing in this way: for example, once they bought a CRM tractor dealer, they renamed entities and fields within the system - oops, the industry CRM ‚ÄúAbvgdSoft.

After that, he will already offer a suitable option from the company's portfolio or will offer to look for another option (yes, it happens!). In general, the best CRM system is one that meets your requirements, is periodically updated and offers high-quality technical support.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If there is no partnership, the vendor will never advise another vendor's CRM, as this is even unethical. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Develop reasonable requirements, chat with several CRM system developers and you will quickly understand which way you should keep moving.</font></font><br><br><a name="b5"></a><h1><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Block 5.

people sell, and CRM makes their work more productive, quick and intelligent (takes the routine for themselves) </font></font><br></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> CRM itself does not sell, it's just a program. </font></font><br></li></ol><br><a name="34"></a><h3> <font color="#cc0000"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Will the CRM system work for me?</font></font></font> </h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">No, it will not. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A CRM system is a tool for an employee of a commercial service, a logistician, a commercial director, a sales person, an analyst, a manager, etc., but this is just a tool. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But trained personnel and a tuned working system work wonders for productivity and profitability.</font></font><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/632/40e/c22/63240ec224a7a8dbc5c3d138bc86b016.png"></div> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Aha!</font></font></i> <br><br><a name="35"></a><h3> <font color="#cc0000"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And can HR managers also use CRM?</font></font></font> </h3><br>  Why not?<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> In the CRM system, it can be convenient to create employee cards, make notes on them, evaluate the effectiveness of each person in the company, if it has such functionality. </font></font><br><br><a name="36"></a><h3> <font color="#cc0000"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And you can do without completely CRM?</font></font></font> </h3><br>  Can.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And without a car you can. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Do not believe it, but even without money, you can do without, especially if you first build a small farm on them. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But what will be the quality of life relative to the 21st century? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You decide, but we would recommend every company to start with a minimum level of CRM, try it and say with good reason: ‚ÄúNafig CRM, and so good.‚Äù </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well, or automated, build relationships with customers and outrun competitors forever.</font></font><br><br><a name="37"></a><h3> <font color="#cc0000"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Is a CRM system a program or not?</font></font></font> </h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of course, the program. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The most classic software that is implemented as a user interface and central storage (DBMS). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe CRM-system platform is developed by experts with extensive experience in business, and the system itself is created by software engineers. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Some developers can do without experts, because over the years of development CRM will give odds to an experienced commercial director, since he knows every part of his work to the last byte.</font></font> But this happens very rarely. <br><br><a name="38"></a><h3> <font color="#cc0000"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Can you rewrite CRM to fit your needs?</font></font></font> </h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">No, rewrite is very long and very expensive (cosmically). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But it is quite possible to modify - by compiling and agreeing the terms of reference, the vendor will refine the CRM system to meet the needs of your business. </font></font><br><br> <a href="https://habr.com/company/regionsoft/blog/336746/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On types of refinement and pitfalls </font></font></a> <br> <a href="https://habr.com/company/regionsoft/blog/306616/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On how to create a technical task </font></font></a> <br> <a href="https://habr.com/company/regionsoft/blog/315888/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On how to live without a technical task</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> (spoiler: no way)</font></font><br><br><a name="39"></a><h3> <font color="#cc0000"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">CRM system can be changed?</font></font></font> </h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yes, if you don‚Äôt have a CRM from one of the vendors or you don‚Äôt like his approach to work, you can switch to another vendor‚Äôs CRM (of course, for the full cost, of course). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In fact, you will almost </font></font><a href="https://habr.com/company/regionsoft/blog/335336/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">complete the entire deployment path</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> with the difference that you need to ask fewer (and sometimes more) questions at the beginning and migrate the database. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">With migration, certain technical difficulties may occur that require additional payment. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But in any case, if you are not comfortable working with the current CRM, you should not pull - it will not be more convenient, and time will be missed, data will be lost (employees may simply not enter information into an inconvenient or unusable interface).</font></font><br><br><a name="40"></a><h3> <font color="#cc0000"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Why are there so many CRM systems in Russia?</font></font></font> </h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are a lot of them in the world, in fact. But the truth is that in Russia there are a lot of them - even we, knowing the market along and across, now and then meet new names or lose some familiar ones. Some vendors have been developing the product and working on the market for years and decades, others understand that this is ‚Äúnot theirs‚Äù and they change the scope of their activities. In fact, a full-fledged and professional can be a team and its system that have existed for more than one year - simply because it is not about an indie game, but about a serious enterprise program that can affect productivity and profits. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The advice is very simple: when choosing a CRM system, specify how many years the vendor has been on the market, which implementations have been. This will give a rough understanding of the qualifications and experience of the developer. Exceptions are extremely rare. We have not met.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you have any questions - be sure to ask. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There will be many - we will write a separate article, if not - we will limit ourselves to comments. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After all, in the end for us such questions are the most important source of information about user requests. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In general, do not be shy. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We answer :-)</font></font><br><br><hr><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚òõ Who we are: the RegionSoft Developer Studio team, the developer and vendor of the </font></font><a href="http://www.regionsoft.ru/"><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">RegionSoft CRM</font></font></b></a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0x/aw/py/0xawpyz6uykl0ml9sgnrjzeezk0.jpeg" width="40" align="left"> <a href="https://t.me/bizbreeze"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Our still live Telegram channel BizBreeze</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Anything about CRM and business, according to the mind, without copy-paste and 90% without advertising. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Subscribe.</font></font></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/358938/">https://habr.com/ru/post/358938/</a></p>
