The world's most famous logos from Apple to McDonalds were carefully designed to be associated at one glance with their brand. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, how ingrained are these logos in our minds?  To find out, Signs.com asked 156 Americans to draw 10 well-known logos from memory, half an hour was allocated for drawing.

      The results turned out to be funny and ridiculous in places, there were a lot of variations on the theme, some elements of the logos were distorted, painted in free form, but there were variations close to the originals. <br><br>  Almost every third participant has attached a stem to the Apple logo (and he does not have it), 22% "bit off" a piece of apple from the wrong side;  while one in 10 people used a shamrock from the adidas logo, which was born in 1971 instead of the three bands used since 1997.  Almost half of the people surveyed were confident that the Starbucks mermaid did not wear a crown (and she still has one on her). <br><br>  So what can we learn from this study?  First of all, the colors of the brand are remembered easier than the form itself - most people can correctly remember the color palette than any other element.  Most successful logos use color (and color theory) to differentiate themselves from competitors. <br><br><h3>  Color - one of the main components of the brand logo </h3><br>  Karen Haller, a leading expert in the field of applied psychology of color, emphasizes the importance of the task of choosing the color that designers face when designing logos. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe emotional connection with the color is initially established, then we perceive the form, the whole logo, we read the words,‚Äù says Haller.  ‚ÄúIf the color causes unreliable feelings, the logo will not be perceived, despite the beautifully written words.‚Äù <br><br>  Would you be able to draw logos better?  To get started, look at some of the masterpieces drawn by participants in an interesting study. Signs.com, confident in your abilities  Take the test yourself, for this you need a minimum - pencils and a piece of paper. <br><br><h3>  Apple </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/da/8d/59da8daea4369171364589.png"><br><br>  In your pocket, on your wrist - where you just can‚Äôt meet Apple devices, about 600 million people around the world use this brand.  It would seem that with such frequent contemplation of the logo, it would be easy to recall its elegantly simple features.  In the end (and unlike Starbucks or Foot Locker) the key to the logo design is in the title itself!  In fact, only 20% of the participants were able to perfectly paint the Apple logo. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/db/16/59db16d8e16ea275121319.png"><br><br>  The most common mistake made by almost every third is a stem, in fact it is not in the logo.  15% depicted a sheet, who is in the wrong direction, who is not of the same form. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/da/b4/59dab443c5967770794645.png"><br><br>  The Apple logo was developed by the Regis McKenna advertising agency in 1977.  The task of art director Rob Janov was to create a business-like emblem (she previously portrayed Isaac Newton sitting under an apple tree), and, according to Steve Jobs's request, the logo needed to be ‚Äúnot cute‚Äù.  The bite - a sign feature of the logo - was made so that the apple did not look like a cherry.  84% remembered about the bite, but 1 of 5 mistakenly drew it on the left side, and not on the right. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/da/b4/59dab4441bd3d977829133.png"><br><br>  Of the 156 people, 5 participants over the age of 40 (3%) depicted the logo in the form of rainbow stripes, such it was from 1977 to 1998.  They may have taken from their memory the logo of their youth.  6% of participants gave the logo red colors (perhaps thinking of a red apple), 72% used black or gray. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/da/8b/59da8b20b61e6886601110.png"><br><br><h3>  Adidas </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/da/8d/59da8deac73cd249706513.png"><br><br>  Adidas is the world's second-largest sports company; the company bought its three-strip logo in 1952 from the shoe brand Karhu Sports for two bottles of whiskey in the equivalent of 2 thousand US dollars.  65 years old iconic stripes adorn the clothes of hundreds of professional athletes and hundreds of millions of consumers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/da/8e/59da8e407778e815278863.png"><br><br>  Despite its omnipresence, the ideal versions of the Adidas logo from memory were able to portray only 12% of study participants.  Ideally, in this case it meant: three lanes (not four or more, as 11% of participants thought), the word ‚Äúadidas‚Äù is written entirely and not in capital letters (21% used the capital A). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/da/7e/59da7e0ef39ea225035320.png"><br><br>  Approximately 1 in 10 people depicted the Adidas emblem in the shape of a trefoil.  This symbol was used at the beginning of 70 and denoted three continents: America, Europe, Africa and Asia.  The shamrock logo is still used on some of the company's products (Adidas Originals line). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/da/7e/59da7e0ef2402594740718.png"><br><br>  The Adidas logo is usually black, 8% of the participants added blue colors to their designs.  Blue is not the primary color of the logo, although it is widely used on Adidas packaging. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/da/7e/59da7e0f43788251376332.png"><br>  <i>Are you the logo of the new Adinike brand?</i> <br><br><h3>  Burger king </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/da/91/59da9152c64c2726101874.png"><br><br>  Unlike the minimalist and monochrome logos of Apple and Adidas, Burger King is harder, combining three different components (text, half a roll and a crescent) and three colors (red, yellow and blue). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/da/7f/59da7fc4b428b084583047.png"><br>  <i>Burger King is also possible</i> <br><br>  18% of the participants were able to almost perfectly depict the Burger King logo from memory, which is already a good indicator compared to 20% of Apple and 12% of Adidas. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/da/7f/59da7fc4c7eb7566414666.png"><br><br>  One of the most interesting results of an experiment is that people often mistakenly recall elements taken from brand advertising.  21% of the participants painted the crown, despite the fact that the Burger King logo only in the period from 1957 to 1969 depicted the king sitting on a burger. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/da/7f/59da7fc444c75619118775.png"><br><br>  It is unlikely that participants with an average age of 34 years old painted a non-existent logo 48 years ago instead of the current version.  Most likely, they could not fully remember what the logo looks like, so they depicted the crown, relying on the word ‚Äúking‚Äù in the name of the brand, the character of the king in advertising and paper crowns, which are issued in restaurants. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/da/92/59da92cc7cecb915738089.png"><br><br><h3>  Dominos </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/da/94/59da94ac43a14841062927.png"><br><br>  The three dots presented on the original Domino's Pizza logo are the symbol of the first three stores belonging to their founders Tom and James Monaghan in the 1960s.  The plans were to add a point when opening another store, but the rapid growth in the number of outlets did not make adjustments to the logo. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/da/80/59da8095818dd084193096.png"><br><br>  28% of the participants remembered that the Dominos logo has three dots and correctly positioned them (two in the lower square, one in the upper part).  37% depicted more than three points, while 14% forgot about their presence at all.  16% approached the ideal features of the Dominos logo, 28% successfully tried to reach the mark of ‚Äúgood‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/da/80/59da809511ee6476736894.png"><br><br>  15% of participants unmistakably drew a square with a slope Dominos logo, which was used from 1996 to 2012. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/da/80/59da808c018f1230140087.png"><br><br>  Two thirds of the participants traced the brand name, although an hour was wrong: 55% forgot about the apostrophe, and 11% added the letter e: Dominoe's. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/da/95/59da959c87e89996039787.png"><br><br><h3>  7-eleven </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/da/97/59da97e8d3eed796243738.png"><br><br>  The 7-Eleven logo has not changed much since 1946.  It shows the number 7, which intersects with the word "Eleven", all this is placed in a white trapezium on a green background.  The only significant change was made in 1969: the upper part "7" turned orange, and the lower part remained red. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/da/87/59da87e814d20539229413.png"><br><br>  19% of participants were able to almost perfectly draw the 7-Eleven logo, and 46% made some minor mistakes.  Two of the most common mistakes were to write ‚ÄúEleven‚Äù as a number (31%) and to write the word ‚ÄúEleven‚Äù under ‚Äú7‚Äù (56%). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/da/87/59da87e8109ba581782216.png"><br><br>  The 7-Eleven logo feature: ‚ÄúEleven‚Äù is written ‚ÄúELEVEn‚Äù - in upper case, with the exception of the letter ‚Äún‚Äù.  Only two of the 156 participants (about 1%) were able to recall this nuance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/da/87/59da87e852cb8763700209.png"><br><br>  Despite the fact that in 50 years the 7-Eleven logo has not changed much, it contains too many elements that can be forgotten or confused in people's memory. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/da/98/59da98c7369ae851749827.png"><br><br><h3>  Foot locker </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/da/9a/59da9aca01858744414129.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/da/9a/59da9ac494bfc311385358.png"><br><br>  Foot Locker and Starbucks are the only brands in this experiment that feature people on their logos.  The character (referee) was least accurately mapped from memory. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/da/9a/59da9ac494be4167690206.png"><br><br>  The logo has been used since 1988, but it is not placed on the window of every Foot Locker store (it has more than 3300 worldwide).  More often, only the brand name is depicted in red, and the judge can be seen on the Foot Locker bags. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/da/9a/59da9ac4e038b211386181.png"><br><br>  Only 8% of the participants were able to get the almost perfect Foot Locker logo from their memory, which makes it second on the list of the most difficult to remember from 10 testers.  Many drew a hat to the referee (18%), a striped shirt without the referee himself (9.7%), shoes or a foot (14%). <br><br><h3>  Starbucks </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/da/9d/59da9d9a09895570250751.png"><br><br>  Since its inception (1971), Starbucks has used three logos, each of them has a mermaid in different designs (siren from Greek mythology).  In the first version of the logo, the mermaid was top loess, but in 1987 the logo was simplified, the breasts became covered with hair and the main color, brown, was replaced with green. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/da/9e/59da9e8ec04b4099765675.png"><br><br>  The current logo (since 2011) with a simplified version of the siren no longer contains the text "Starbucks Coffee", using pure green color.  Despite this simplification, only 6% of participants were able to accurately depict the perfect Starbucks logo from memory. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/da/9e/59da9eb8a615d499484239.png"><br><br>  There is no doubt that the mermaid Starbucks is a very memorable element (90% remembered her), but it's very difficult to convey her in the picture, accurately depicting all the details and shape.  45% forgot that she wears a crown, 16%, who painted the crown, depicted a star in the center, and 55% lost sight of its forked tails.  31% of participants transferred elements of the old logo, which featured the brand name and black circle, to the Starbucks logo from 2011. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/da/9e/59da9ed437f00378810041.png"><br><br>  It turns out that despite the fact that Starbucks sells about 18 million cups of coffee every day, the logo rightfully holds the first place in the ‚Äúleast memorable‚Äù category of the 10 brands that were taken for research. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/da/9e/59da9eea3eb1e014661731.png"><br><br><h3>  Walmart </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/da/a2/59daa28018f83907170862.png"><br><br>  Walmart is the world's largest company, with 11,500 stores in 28 countries.  The first logo (from 1962 to 1964) was basic, consisting of simple inscriptions sans serif and no characters.  Later, the font was replaced with ‚ÄúFrontier Font‚Äù, somewhat reminiscent of the Wild West, but in 1981 the company returned to a simple spelling with a hyphen between ‚ÄúWal‚Äù and ‚ÄúMart‚Äù.  One out of ten participants drew a hyphen in their images. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/da/a2/59daa289d36e7779985784.png"><br><br>  In 1992, the star replaced the hyphen (7% of the participants remembered it in their drawings).  In 2008, Walmart has developed a more friendly logo, removing the hyphen, adding a text name and a solar charge symbol.  68% of participants remembered the sun rays. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/da/a2/59daa28a294b1565234929.png"><br><br>  12% of participants pulled out almost perfect Walmart logo from memory.  As for color and text, the Walmart logo is very simple.  But the symbol of the sun's rays is something that is hard to remember.  Many are confused in the number and location of the rays. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/da/a2/59daa28a15e5b329660285.png"><br><br>  Make images close to perfection interfered with the confusion between the old and the new version of the logo. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/da/a3/59daa380c0152712330154.png"><br><br><h3>  Target </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/da/a5/59daa57e9a8cf312388529.png"><br><br>  Along with Walmart, Target is the largest retail chain in the United States.  Its logo is one of the most recognizable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/da/81/59da81a784ff0558688716.png"><br>  <i>Sight or target, that is the question</i> <br><br>  During the experiment, a quarter of people managed to ideally transfer the logo from memory, this put the Target logo in second place among the most memorable of the 10 tested emblems.  52% were able to draw a logo corresponding to the ‚Äúgood‚Äù mark, only a few minor mistakes were made. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/da/81/59da81a7c2570805860087.png"><br><br>  The color of the logo was transmitted correctly (100% of the participants remembered about the red color).  59% remembered about a circle in the center and one ring around it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/da/81/59da81a7c7bc1832817461.png"><br>  <i>Almost original</i> <br><br>  Most participants (59%) wrote the word "Target / Target".  Skipping the brand name cannot be considered a blunder, as Target separated the name from its logo in advertisements and commercials only from 2006, believing that most users are familiar enough with the brand and will be able to associate the image with the company without literal support. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/da/a6/59daa602bd50f448553650.png"><br><br><h3>  Ikea </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/da/a9/59daa948b1539588283846.png"><br><br>  The logo most accurately drawn from the memory of 156 Americans belongs to the Swedish company IKEA. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/da/83/59da83da53387847970949.png"><br><br>  The 30% of participants who drew the IKEA logo from memory were able to completely recreate the combination of text, shapes, and color, which is a good result compared to 25% Target and 20% Apple. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/da/84/59da844ea12e9196785208.png"><br><br>  One of the most important elements of the IKEA logo is the letters.  88% of participants remembered that they are written in upper case. <br><br>  The IKEA logo is depicted with or without a yellow oval in blue letters, depending on where it is used: be it an IKEA showcase or a logo made of printed materials and commercials.  41% of the drawings contained the oval of the brand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/db/44/59db441171b90871751815.png"><br><br>  The study, in fact, not large-scale, but emphasizes one of the main tasks of logo design - to create a sign so that it can be easily remembered, while making it quite distinctive and competitive.  In the graphical experiment, 156 Americans between the ages of 20 and 70 took part, 50% of women, 47% of men, 3% left their affiliation to one or the other sex in secret.  Logos were evaluated by a group of five design and marketing specialists.  Each of them gave an assessment of more than 1500 drawings, taking into account the transfer of basic elements, proportions and color palettes. <br><br>  As Sherlock Holmes said, we "see, but do not observe."  The logos of giant corporations are so common to our eyes that we don‚Äôt need to photograph them in order to recognize them later.  But here we often do not pay attention to the details, such a process is called ‚Äúamnesia due to carelessness‚Äù. <br><br>  Self-confidence about your ability to memorize logos is amazingly erroneous.  Any doubts?  Answer the simple question: what color is the second letter in the Google logo? <br><br>  When writing, the translation of the article by Julia Sagar <a href="http://www.creativebloq.com/news/10-iconic-logos-hilariously-drawn-from-memory">‚Äú10 iconic logos hilariously drawn from memory‚Äù</a> and <a href="https://www.signs.com/branded-in-memory/">‚Äú10 iconic logos.</a>  <a href="https://www.signs.com/branded-in-memory/">156 Americans.</a>  <a href="https://www.signs.com/branded-in-memory/">80 hours of drawing from memory</a> . <br><br>  <b>As advertising.</b>  Stock!
