    <h4>  Foreword </h4><br>  We learned to yawn well (if not, read on anyway).  Yawn, and at the same time pull the sound, realizing how our voice should go. <br><br>  And so, we continue. <br><br>  Lean back in your chair, relax your jaw.  Think about how you relax it, how every muscle relaxes.  The lower jaw drops, the tongue goes to the base.  And this happens by itself, without the tension of the muscles.  Yawn  And pull the sound. <br><br>  Maybe even if yawning is bad, or just not yawning, now we start the basic exercises and we will succeed. <br><br><h4>  Exercises </h4><br>  Stay relaxed, with the lower jaw lowered, tongue out.  Further there will be 4 exercises for which you are naming, I guarantee it. <br>  The main task of all 4 exercises is to breathe.  It just needs to be done <s>in various poses</s> with different positions of the mouth.  Performed within one minute.  A break between exercises for 2-3 minutes. <br>  Do not forget about relax! <br><br>  1. Squeeze the lips, while the teeth are not compressed.  Breathe through the nose. <br>  2. Squeeze your teeth, stretch your lips.  Breathe. <br>  3. Straighten the teeth and lips, mouth slightly open by half a centimeter, hold your nose with your fingers.  Breathe. <br>  4. Release the unfortunate nose - and breathe. <br><br>  In the process of exercise, you will yawn - this is extremely good, yawn more.  Yawning is very helpful. <br>  These exercises are desirable to perform more often.  For example, in public transport - 1.2 and 4. <br>  3rd (with a clamped nose) - for example in the toilet.  Understand. <br><br>  Sometimes try to pull the sound while breathing, after yawning.  You will feel the sound as from the first article, loud and clear, which flows easily and freely, without muscle tension. <br>  Try to calibrate - higher - lower. <br>  We'll pay attention to the next article. <br><br>  Now perform at least one exercise, and try to evaluate the result.  We will stretch the sound.  Speaking sound is also included in the set of exercises, but it is better to perform it later, when you will already be easy, without any special efforts, to make a loud sound.  But now we will try to understand what we have done.  The sound should be vibrating (in unison with the diaphragm). <br><br><h6>  Profit </h6><br>  Listen to habravideo, like this should be yours. <br><video>  http://rutube.ru/tracks/3304528.html?v=69dcf6a2ff189c6e88776945385f28ff </video><br>  Loud enough, the voice is not clamped, it feels like it diverges in all directions, and vibrates a little. <br><br>  Sit up straight.  Straighten your back, one hand on the diaphragm. Relax your jaw.  Inhale. <br>  The throat will twitch a little as if yawning, if you start yawning then do not stop. <br>  And pull the sound.  Moaning  Do not lower the head.  Feel the vibration at hand (which lies in the diaphragm, and not the head props (pun, haha)). <br>  Great, we got a voice. <br><br><h4>  Now what ? </h4><br>  The task for the next few days is to breathe with your mouth with a relaxed throat in the ways described above.  It is important to use all four times - this will allow you to better understand your voice, and it will become easier for you to control it.  Then we will practice with tones, everything will be simple there, now it is difficult to start, and it is very difficult to remember to give it 10-15 minutes a day. <br>  After which we proceed to the diction to clearly pronounce the letters. <br><br>  PS If you do on the street - see that no one interferes.  I somehow thought, and in the region of midnight I very much frightened grandmother from behind. <br><br>  PSP In the first article I was asked about the literature - we answer.  In my opinion, a textbook that reads first of all, which includes breathing, diction and rules of speech - <br>  S. T. Nikolskaya "TECHNOLOGY OF SPEECH" Moscow, 1978. <br>  You can find yourself know where. <br><br>  At this we briefly say goodbye, loud voice to you and do not forget about it. / </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/95586/">https://habr.com/ru/post/95586/</a></p>
