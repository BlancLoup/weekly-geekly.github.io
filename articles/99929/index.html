  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Toyota agreed with Alexander Severinsky</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For six years, American engineer Alexander Severinsky tried to knock out the world's largest automaker of royalty for using his patent, a key element of the hybrid engine.  He finally succeeded.  On Monday, it became known that Toyota <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-07-19/toyota-settles-infringement-case-over-hybrid-patent.html">agreed to meet the</a> requirements of Severinsky. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/facf25e1/281fa46a/ae7ecfdd/27158b4c.jpg"><br><br>  A graduate of the Kharkov Institute of Radio Electronics (graduated in 1967), <a href="http://www.eng.umd.edu/ihof/inductees/severinsky.html">Alexander Severinsky</a> emigrated to the USA in 1978, and now holds the position of professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Maryland. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the 80s, Alexander was engaged in the development of continuous power supply technologies for computer systems.  By that time, the patented technologies of hybrid engines already existed (since 1898), but they did not know how to switch imperceptibly from a gasoline drive to an electric one, like modern cars.  Alexander Severinsky just worked in this area and developed an electronic system that provided continuous power supply.

For comparison, Toyota owns more than 4,000 patents in the field of hybrid engines: these are about 43% of the total number of patents of all patents that relate to hybrids.  Only the Prius is protected by more than 1,000 patents.  Toyota's hybrid technology under license is used by some other manufacturers, including Ford. <br><br>  In December 1997, Toyota began serial production of the Prius hybrid car, which since 2000 has entered the US market. <br><br>  On June 8, 2004, Alexander Severinsky filed a lawsuit against Toyota in the district court of one of the Texas districts.  In December 2005, the judge decided that Toyota must pay $ 4,269,950, based on the number of Prius, Highlander and Lexus RX4hh hybrids sold in the United States for the period from June 2004 to November 2005.  Toyota filed an appeal. Thus began a <a href="http://www.paice.net/about-paice/paice-a-timeline-of-events">six-year epic</a> , which ended on Monday. <br><br>  Actually, Toyota had no other choice, because on Monday the start of hearings at the International Trade Commission was scheduled, which at the time of the trial could easily have suspended the American import of Toyota Prius and other hybrids, which would have caused Toyota irreparable financial damage. <br><br>  It remains unknown how much Toyota agreed to pay Alexander Severinsky to hush up the matter.  Perhaps, we are talking about the amount of about $ 50-100 million. But the company said at the same time that it was developing its own hybrid engine, Synergy Drive, and did not know anything about the patents of the American engineer. <br><br>  via <a href="http://jalopnik.com/5592533/this-man-fought-toyota-for-stealing-his-hybrid-tech-and-won">Jalopnik</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/99929/">https://habr.com/ru/post/99929/</a></p>
