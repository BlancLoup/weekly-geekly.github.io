Also, since then, we are moving from the name Nokia to Microsoft on our websites, on packaging labels and in a number of other cases that are in any way connected with consumers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f3c/5d9/c86/f3c5d9c86a1f416eba9d673db6f9897f.png"><br><br>  In the coming weeks and months, you will see even more changes as we continue the transition from Nokia Lumia to Microsoft Lumia.

      Our colleagues from the Conversations portal met with Tuula Rytil√§, senior vice president of Microsoft, head of the phone marketing division, to talk about these changes. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f7f/932/0d7/f7f9320d772f4897b4700d31111d75bc.jpg"><br><br>  <b>The transition from Nokia Lumia to Microsoft Lumia has already begun.</b>  <b>Please tell us about these changes.</b>  <b>What specific changes will we see?</b> <br><br>  This is a very unusual period for us and the Lumia line.  You may have already noticed that over the past couple of months we have already made some changes to the names of our applications in order to more clearly indicate that these applications are now being released by Microsoft. <br><br>  Our global and local sites are also experiencing these changes, and in the coming days, our social media channels will also receive a new name: now they will be called Microsoft Lumia.  We would like to invite Lumia fans to keep up with new developments and always be updated on the latest news about our devices on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. <br><br>  This work continues, among other things, across the entire range of our devices, in packaging and retail.  Everything is going according to plan, and we are very pleased that our integration with Microsoft continues. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b6f/48c/492/b6f48c4922934fa5b0459d2eef2f60a2.png"><br><br>  <b>When can we see the first Microsoft Lumia device?</b> <br><br>  I can not comment on the announcements of future products, but I will say that we expect the news about the release of the Microsoft Lumia device very soon.  This is natural, since all devices that previously went under the Nokia brand are now released under the Microsoft brand. <br><br>  In addition, our focus on the production of phones of excellent quality and with wide functionality will remain the same, our customers know about it and appreciate it.  And yet, Lumia phones will also offer the best Microsoft services (such as Office, OneDrive, Skype and Bing), in order to help users both in their work and in everyday life. <br><br>  <b>What does Lumia mean to users?</b> <br><br>  Microsoft was created with the intention of providing people with a computer in every home and on every desktop.  In the case of Lumia phones, Microsoft gives everyone the opportunity to use mobile technology every day.  We are introducing innovations such as advanced camera functions, wireless charging, advanced design and much more - all this has been implemented in our line of smartphones.  We will continue to do so.  Microsoft intends to continue to equip Lumia phones with amazing functionality and expand the line to offer each user something special. <br><br>  In addition, Lumia is now part of the Microsoft family, which includes such proven products as Xbox, Windows and Surface, as well as services such as Skype, Office and Bing. <br><br>  <b>But does this mean that the existing Nokia Lumia smartphones available on the market are outdated?</b> <br><br>  Of course not!  Microsoft continues to sell and support the Nokia Lumia models already on the market ‚Äî for example, the recently introduced Lumia 830 and Lumia 730/735.  As I said, the Lumia line, which you love so much, will remain the same with all its capabilities.  We will continue to pay special attention to guarantees and provide high-class service support, as before. <br><br>  <b>Will we see the new Nokia phones from Microsoft?</b> <br><br>  Yes!  Microsoft will continue to sell affordable Nokia-branded phones, such as the Nokia 130. We have acquired a license for the Nokia brand to sell such devices. <br><br>  As Tuula has already said, our Internet channels will undergo a number of changes, including the Conversations blog.  In the coming weeks we will move to our new Microsoft platform.  We will continue to cover all the upcoming changes and we hope that you will not forget to come to our housewarming party! <br><br>  <b>And we write in: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/MicrosoftLumia">Habrahabr</a> |</b>  <b><a href="https://twitter.com/LumiaRussia">Twitter</a> |</b>  <b><a href="http://vk.com/MicrosoftLumia">VKontakte</a> |</b>  <b><a href="https://www.facebook.com/MicrosoftLumiaRU">Facebook</a> |</b>  <b><a href="https://plus.google.com/112598323683416588312">Google+</a></b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/362231/">https://habr.com/ru/post/362231/</a></p>
