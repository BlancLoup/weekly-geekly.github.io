  <section class="page js-page"><h1>5 Apple Watch features, and 5 more that are not yet available for these watches</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e46/595/f6c/e46595f6cb964faea14d447d7773ab8a.jpg" align="left">  Can I call an Apple fan?  I think that definitely yes.  Hooked on this culture many years ago, starting out purely by chance with a white plastic MacBook, the very first IPhone (which terribly slowed down and was mercilessly jailbroken with its own inept hands) and IMac 24 "(which also had a DVD drive and a mouse with a cord) , any attempts to move to a different ecosystem inevitably ended in failure. Gradually, at home and at work a small museum turned out - an IPhone from the very first to the current 5S; the iPad Mini and one that doesn‚Äôt know what it was called, but which was before the modern Air; MacBook Air 13 "and MacBook Pro 15"; 3 TB Time Capsule;  IMac 27 ";  I am waiting for the start of sales of the iPhone 6S Plus.  I hope the list will continue.  And that‚Äôs why Apple‚Äôs latest innovation is just something with something: a high-tech watch that company CEO Tim Cook hopes will help people ‚Äúredefine their expectations‚Äù from wearable devices.  Such watches are capable of more than just showing time.  What exactly can <a href="http://www.apple.com/watch/">AppleWatch</a> , and what - can not under habrakatom? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, the $ 350 <b>AppleWatch is</b> designed for everyday wear, and in order to gain access to most of the watch‚Äôs functionality, an iPhone is needed.  Watches can track physical activity, they can communicate with friends, as well as use a large number of applications.  With their help, you can even make purchases - they support the <a href="http://www.apple.com/apple-pay/">ApplePay</a> payment system, which keeps the data safe and also supports the anonymity trend: thanks to data encryption, Apple does not know who made the purchase, or what exactly it purchased, and the seller does not receives customer credit card information. <br><br>  In connection with the interest in the company's products as a whole, we have thoroughly studied the new gadget, and present to your attention five functions that AppleWatch has and five more, which, unfortunately, are not available in this device. <br><br>  <b>Messages and calls.</b>  There are many ways to communicate using this device: users can send and receive messages by dictating them or choosing the answer from existing options.  There is a built-in speaker and microphone that allow you to make calls, although in reality calls pass through a smartphone connected to the clock, the clock does not have direct access to the network.  Users can mute the sound of incoming calls by covering the clock with their hands.  Also available is a new way to communicate, called "digital touch", which allows you to draw on the screen of the clock, and then send the image to your friends (almost like in Snapchat).

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d59/b7c/34b/d59b7c34b2984cbe8a18ccba5dadaa80.png"><br><br>  <b>Siri.</b>  You can activate Apple's personal assistant by saying ‚ÄúHi, Siri‚Äù or scrolling down the ‚Äúdigital crown‚Äù (wheel on an ordinary watch) on the side of the device.  With the help of Siri, users can dictate messages for friends, get voice guidance on the direction of movement, or carry out a local search, for example, watch movie showtimes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/97e/fb6/50c/97efb650cb884cae95e48c8f61241ae4.png"><br><br>  <b>Tracking physical activity (fitness tracking).</b>  Apple believes that watches can help people lead a healthier lifestyle by setting goals in specialized applications, as well as tracking physical activity using built-in sensors.  The accelerometer is built into the clock (a device for measuring acceleration), as in a smartphone, and the pulse sensor, which uses infrared LEDs and photodiodes, is also used.  Activityapp will create graphs in which the periods will indicate the number of calories burned or how long you have been on your feet.  The training app provides detailed information about specific activities such as running and cycling.  Meanwhile, Healthapp on the iPhone allows users to share data with third-party applications dedicated to a healthy lifestyle and fitness. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6b1/f44/a85/6b1f44a8559a47b1a6e0b3a80b63ec1e.png"><br><br>  <b>Shopping</b>  One of the most intriguing features of the watch is support for ApplePay, the new system that should replace debit and credit cards in the shopping process.  She based on NFC (short-range wireless technology), which was already available on some Android smartphones, but not on Apple devices.  Holders of Visa, Master Card and Amex will be able to store information about their cards in an Apple file, and Apple will create an account number for each card on the device, which is stored on the SecureElement chip.  Owners of watches will be able to make purchases by double clicking on the button under the ‚Äúcrown‚Äù and waving their wrist in front of special reading devices in the store.  Apple says this feature is available in Macy, McDonald's and many other places where a reader is installed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/af3/a13/5e4/af3a135e46394c1c8ce041af15c10dcd.png"><br><br>  <b>Applications.</b>  AppleWatch has a completely new interface, applications look like small, round icons. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cf3/23d/92d/cf323d92d2394802bc9c3b7b30a8af11.png"><br><br>  The watch uses what Apple representatives call a ‚Äúticking and stomping mechanism‚Äù for alerts and notifications in applications: the watch will vibrate or ‚Äútap the tap on your wrist‚Äù when an alert about something arrives.  There are a number of built-in applications such as calendar, maps, photos, and music.  Users can switch music on their iPhone using the clock, the watch itself can also play music, although it is unclear how many songs can be stored in the watch‚Äôs memory.  WatchKit tools allow developers to create more applications for the device. <br><br>  A fairly large number of features are included in the small AppleWatch.  But here are the five things that are not there yet: <br><br>  <b>Universal compatibility.</b>  Many functions of the watch, such as receiving calls and emails, require a mandatory connection to the iPhone.  While the watch can only work with the new iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, as well as with 5, 5C and 5S.  You can also not hope that they will work with phones based on Android and Windows Phone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/940/b0c/160/940b0c16008e4488977540ea6cd3c074.png"><br><br>  <b>Keyboard.</b>  To send messages, they need to be dictated into the microphone or choose from templates.  This is similar to how the AndroidWear smartwatch now works. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/859/5d8/d29/8595d8d291664cb8bda86e8e9316c7c4.png"><br><br>  Apple representatives say the watch is smart enough to analyze incoming messages and display suitable responses that can be sent. <br><br>  <b>Separate camera.</b>  The watch can display your favorite photos from a Macbook or iPhone, but there is no own built-in camera there. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d06/8f8/0fe/d068f80fe2174bd59a2509fb9ba64e6e.png"><br><br>  They can be used as a remote viewfinder, but only for the camera on the phone.  You can also use the clock to take a photo (from the phone) or set a timer for the iPhone's camera. <br><br>  <b>Built-in GPS and Wi-Fi.</b>  For this you need to connect to the iPhone.  If you are riding a bicycle or doing some other physical activity that cannot be measured in steps with an accelerometer, the watch cannot track the distance traveled without the help of a telephone. <br><br>  Another important thing that AppleWatch does not yet have <b>is information about the start date of sales.</b>  Apple representatives said that the watch will be available in "early 2015", but did not specify when.  In the meantime, we all look forward to Friday - the day of the official launch of sales of the iPhone 6 in Russia. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/237753/">https://habr.com/ru/post/237753/</a></p>
