  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is Pibox and how did it come about?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello, <br><br>  With this article we open a series of publications about how we built our startup, what we completed, and then we will keep a diary of the everyday (sometimes weekend) of our project. <br>  <a href="https://pibox.com/">Pibox</a> is a cloud messenger that can transfer large volumes of files without loss of quality.  You can send HD videos, unprocessed photos and anything, and the addressee will receive files of exactly the quality you would like. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  With this project we want to solve the problem of easy transfer of large files.  We have 3G, LTE, and news about the development of 6G is already emerging.  The camera on our smartphone is getting better from model to model, and GoPro4 can shoot 4k video, but still you can‚Äôt transfer photos or videos without losing quality, and if you can, you need to do a whole bunch of gestures. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/-irhOLjUJVQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjZGDu4Mu5lWOCQrP1ipOXtQznqog" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

      Initially, we wanted to add cloud storage on Facebook, but after collecting feedback from the market, after launching the minimum version, it became clear that it was necessary to bring it into a separate product, since there is demand for it and it is not limited to file transfer, but also requires active discussion.  No sooner said than done.  From the end of 2014 begins the understanding of what we want to achieve, and the development will start in January.  Every day we started to realize more and more that this should be the final result and in May we showed the first, raw but beta.  We made a small announcement about the discovery of friends and startup groups.  After corrections and improvements, we launched the project on Betali.st.  Looking ahead, I will say that the resource is very controversial, it gives traffic - it gives registration, but there is very little feedback, not to say, not at all, but about this in the next article. <br><br>  So, after fixing minor bugs, we launched on the ProductHunt site and received the first significant increase in traffic.  If we believe SimilarWeb, we had 15k unique ones, in fact a little less, but still.  Which, again, gave us a pack of reviews that will last for 2-3 months of work, but here it is, the long-awaited confirmation of the market. <br>  At the moment we can: <br><ul><li>  Register with one click, through Facebook; </li><li>  Add friends again through FB; </li><li>  Get a place using the referral link.  For each new person we give 3.14 GB to the one who invited and the one who came; </li><li>  You can create personal and group chats (without limitation, by the number of participants); </li><li>  Reply to messages; </li><li>  Send files up to 10 GB, without loss of quality; </li><li>  Store all files in the cloud, and manage them there; </li><li>  Open popular formats; </li><li>  Communicate with those who were not our users. </li></ul><br><br>  And much more.  In the near future, we will continue to improve interaction with files, teach Pibox to open more formats, release mobile applications in the fall, do the usual registration and add photo / video editing.  That's all - plans for the next couple of months, more - more! <br>  In the next article I will talk about how we went to ProductHunt. <br><br>  Follow our updates, and write all your wishes directly in the comments under this post or email ruslan@pibox.com. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294122/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294122/</a></p>
