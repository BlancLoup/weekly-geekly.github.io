Sales increase</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Many owners of online stores are not sleeping now and are suffering with thoughts on how to increase sales during the crisis. <br><br>  <b>1. The most effective and important</b> is customer feedback.  Those who have already managed to build up a customer base have at hand a huge potential. <br><br>  The main problem is customer savings.  Naturally, if you took customers not at a low price, then a significant part of customers now wanders in search of lower prices.  There is a good chance to keep them.

      <i>What need to do?</i> <br><br>  Offer these customers a new, higher discount from your discount system.  First, your customers, customers who liked your company, they liked to cooperate with you.  Searching for a new store is like searching for new products in the store, when your loved ones have disappeared somewhere: it‚Äôs scary that you‚Äôre of poor quality, you‚Äôll lose yourself among the choices.  In this case, psychology is on your side.  Secondly, a higher discount is a lower price; now, even if the customer finds a lower price, the difference may be insignificant and it will not replay your customer's location to you. <br><br>  <i>How to find such customers among the database?</i> <br><br>  It is likely that you will offer an increase in discounts to customers who have no financial difficulties.  Nothing wrong.  But you can identify customers who are financially unstable now, in two ways. <br><br>  First: find among the base those who made the last order a very long time.  Even if the client had only one order - it will go.  ‚ÄúA very long time ago‚Äù is measured by the renewal period of the product, and also by your personal experience. <br><br>  Second, find customers who placed orders in the lower and middle-lower price segment.  They are most likely affected by the crisis very much.  Among such buyers may be your good customers, so an additional discount may be more than ever. <br><br>  Of course, this method requires a well-organized customer base.  Most can not boast.  Try handles. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>2. Promotions.</b>  Do not forget that now there are many new customers on the market: those who, in order to save, have moved from offline to online, those who in order to search for low prices have left their homes. <br><br>  Stocks are a good way to attract the first, and make them loyal customers, and attract the second, at least make a one-time purchase and make not much money, but still make money. <br><br>  Often there is a problem, to which the action is tied. <br><br>  * Summer is coming.  A good reason for the stores of perfumes, comets, clothing and accessories and other seasonal products to make a discount. <br><br>  * Finally, simple warming is also a reason to make a discount.  ‚ÄúPrice thaw on refrigerators‚Äù.  In Russia, I know it was recently cold, now very warm. <br><br>  * Maybe some brand soon DR, or was recently.  The reason to reduce the prices of his goods. <br><br>  * For youth goods, you can think of any comical reason: ‚ÄúElephants ran past the office and trampled our prices‚Äù (silly words), but the bottom line is, the funnier the reason you come up, the more fun and interesting it will be. <br><br>  Enough of the reasons. <br><br>  <b>3. Expansion of the range</b> <br><br>  Very effective and timely step.  Costs will not require any.  But the expansion of the range, always means new orders.  Therefore, if you once were lazy to expand the range, then now is the time.  You work with any product, there is a buyer for each product.  Moreover, now some suppliers have also begun to expand the range. <br><br>  <b>4. Feedback from customers again.</b>  I would just like to say about this type of sales promotion, and not just to offer discounts. <br><br>  What to send to customers?  I have already written 3 points above that you need to notify your customers.  In addition to them, there are many other reasons to remind yourself of your customers.  Just do not do this too often - once a month is enough. <br><br>  <b>5. Shops - partners.</b>  Start to cooperate with other online stores, offer your customers lucrative offers in the partner store.  The simplest solution is to print both coupons and distribute them to customers. <br><br>  <i>Do you know what the biggest problem is?</i>  <i>The requirement to work and work a lot!</i>  <i>To do everything I wrote, you have to work a lot.</i>  <i>Most of this can not do.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/58448/">https://habr.com/ru/post/58448/</a></p>
