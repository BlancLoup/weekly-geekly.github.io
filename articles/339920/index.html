      Immediately after this, the performances of the participants began: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  The paradigm of "concierge".  Gareth brown </h3><br>  Gareth Brown talked about how you can simplify orchestra in Docker by launching Zabbix agent as a co-process that can manage auto-registration and scaling.  He cited a number of practical examples of using this approach for containers used at the enterprise level both in the clouds and in his data center.  Difficult performance, but it looks with great interest, because it is filled not only with details, but also with high-quality English humor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/df/24/59df242082ce7064994046.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  From Low Level Discovery to SuperDiscovery.  Ilya Ableyev </h3><br>  Ilya talked about how Badoo, the largest online dating service, managed to get developers involved in setting up metrics for Zabbix without immersing them in the details of monitoring work.  How can this be achieved if you have a large, distributed IT environment, a lot of critical components for monitoring, everything is constantly changing, and the admin team is much smaller than the development team?  Ilya tells in detail in his slides how they have come a long way from ‚ÄúLow Level Detection‚Äù to ‚ÄúSuper Detection‚Äù. <br><br><h3>  Oleg Ivanivsky on how to test the strength of the Zabbix support team </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/df/24/59df242081e28384472605.png"><br><br>  In the energetic speech of Oleg (Oleg Ivanivskyi), an experienced trainer and engineer of the Zabbix support team, there is a long list of ‚Äúrules‚Äù, the observance of which is guaranteed to make it difficult for technical support engineers to find solutions to your problem.  Want help to be quick and effective?  Do not do this (all in the slides)! <br><br><h3>  We manage Zabbix through Jabber Bot </h3><br>  Do you know what ChatOps is?  How and why can a bot be used to manage monitoring?  See this in the presentation of Miroslav Baglasha (Miroslav Baglja≈°).  His team uses the Ludolph bot to communicate with Zabbix.  The bot is written in Python, communicates with Zabbix via API, supports plugins and <a href="https://github.com/erigones/ludolph">is available</a> in open source. <br><br><h3>  Upgrade Zabbix and sleep well.  Richards Alups </h3><br>  Well-known Zabbix community activist Richards Olups (Rihards Olups, aka ‚Äúrichlv‚Äù) talked about how the Nokia division, where he is responsible for administering applications, switched to Zabbix 3.4 after years of use 1.8.  How they prepared, planned what they were afraid of, how they solved the problems.  And how it ended (spoiler: the transition took place, everything turned out).  In the presentation there are many details and conclusions about ‚Äúhow to do it right‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/df/24/59df2470e0fce436680380.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  Migration to Zabbix 3.2 and Galera cluster in a large bank.  Javier Schneider </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/df/24/59df2470d9486407913686.png"><br><br>  Only 5 minutes Zabbix was unavailable during the migration of monitoring from Zabbix 2.4 to 3.2 in one of the largest French investment banks, NATIXIS.  With more than 20,000 hosts being monitored, 2,000,000 metrics, and 1,200 users in the system.  About how everything happened, what methodology was used and what advantages Galera Cluster can provide for high performance and availability - see the presentation by Javier (Xavier Schneider). <br><br><h3>  Integration with Zabbix to manage cloud data center.  Daniel Contcheck </h3><br>  How to monitor a dynamic cloud data center in which thousands of virtual machines and containers are created, destroyed, changed daily?  In his speech, Daniel Kont≈°ek from Danube Cloud told and showed how Zabbix API can be used to integrate with the data center management system, having received all the advantages of Zabbix. <br><br><h3>  Integration Zabbix and ServiceNow.  TV2 Denmark </h3><br>  Zabbix was created for monitoring, and ServiceNow - for incident management.  Their integration brings many benefits. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/df/24/59df24714a38e379324114.jpeg"><br><br>  As experts each in their field, Morten Moesgaard and Michael Toft Andersen described how they built an integrated system in which Zabbix detects problems and ServiceNow manages incidents.  As a result, system users receive high-quality information about incidents, plus working instructions on what to do with this or that problem. <br><br><h3>  Using Zabbix on the Internet of Things.  Fabrizio Fantoni </h3><br>  The versatility of Zabbix allows it to be used for monitoring and data collection as applied to the Internet of Things (IoT). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/df/24/59df24713fda0430933197.png"><br><br>  Sensors and IoT devices usually do not work using SNMP, but using specific protocols like Modbus.  The presentation of Fabrizio Fantoni from Systematica was about how a distributed system was built on the basis of an industrial computer and a Zabbix proxy installed on it to collect data from energy consumption sensors.  As an unstable network resistant Zabbix architecture, it helps the entire solution to work reliably even in harsh industrial environments. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/df/24/59df24f824593470091870.png"><br><br><h3>  The story of Zabbix from James Green </h3><br>  In his presentation, James (James Green) from the company NHK International told about how they decided on an open source solution in a large corporation and what prompted them to choose Zabbix from a large number of competitors (there is a detailed comparison). <br><br><h3>  Forecasting in Zabbix: examples of use and ideas for the future </h3><br>  Sergey Mescheryakov together with Kristina Kucherova (the first woman among the speakers!) Told in detail and in detail about three scenarios for applying trend prediction functionality in Zabbix.  In the presentation there are many facts from the history, graphs and tips to developers. <br><br><h2>  5 minutes of inspiration </h2><br>  At the end of the main session of the conference, consisting of long, honest presentations, a series of brief, expressive speeches, the so-called Lightning Talks, was traditional for the 2nd day: <br><br><h3>  How to organize Zabbix Meetup?  Experience from organizers from around the world </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/df/24/59df247188abc139602143.png"><br><br>  Katerina Yastrebova from the marketing team talked about regular Zabbix meetings, allowing to keep in touch with Zabbix users in different parts of the world.  Zabbix-evangelist Steve Destivelle (Steve Destivelle) together with Ilya Ableyev and Luciano Alves (Luciano Alves) from Unirede shared their experiences in organizing these meetings in France, Russia and Brazil. <br><br>  Do you want to organize Zabbbix-meetup at your place?  Zabbix will help you.  How and what - see the presentation. <br><br><h3>  Another example of user development: Zabbix + Telegram.  Ilya Ableyev </h3><br>  For the third time in a day, going up to the stage, Ilya told about his own development - the integration of Zabbix and Telegram for sending alerts via an instant messenger.  You can insert graphics, html and even emoticons into messages. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/df/24/59df2471b340d842462297.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  And again Zabbix users are at the height: Vladimir Ulgov and ZQL </h3><br>  Zabbix-evangelist Vladimir Ulgov never runs out of ideas!  In this presentation, he introduced Zabbix Query language based on LISP, which helps automate things in Zabbix.  Try it and you! <br><br><h3>  Zabbix in the Munich Metro - I love trains!  Wolfgang Alper </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/df/24/59df247211408839441876.png"><br><br>  It turns out for some time all ground and underground trains in Munich are monitored by Zabbix!  A fascinating, colorful presentation filled with a warm attitude to trains and Zabbix-y from a long-time partner and Zabbix-trainer Wolfgang Alper. <br><br><h2>  Tweets do not happen much! </h2><br>  Listeners during all the days of the conference also had the opportunity to prove themselves by participating in the [several nominations] ‚ÄúZabbix Challenge‚Äù competition, gaining points for tweets of pictures, reposts and questions asked to participants.  Thanks to such social activity, many people outside the conference hall learned about what was happening.  For some time <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ZabConf2017"># ZabConf2017 has</a> even become the most popular tag on Latvian twitter. <br><br>  The prize ‚ÄúMost Passionate Twitter Feed‚Äù was received by Steve Destivelle.  And Dmitry Tigrov was the winner, gaining the most points in the ‚ÄúZabbix Challenge‚Äù. <br>  Many thanks to all who participated! <br><br><h3>  Closing speech by Alexey Vladyshev </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/df/24/59df24724c5dd359330122.jpeg"><br><br>  Alexey made a warm speech, mentioning how he liked the conference, thanking everyone for coming and praising the Zabbix team for their work. <br>  We are waiting for everyone next year, we are already preparing a program with new ideas and surprises.  Come on! <br><br>  All the presentations mentioned above can be viewed <a href="https://www.zabbix.com/conf2017_agenda">here</a> .  Videos will be coming soon! <br><br>  Experience the emotions from the conference in our <a href="https://www.zabbix.com/conf2017_gallery">photo gallery</a> ! <br><br>  <b>PS The</b> article is also available in English in our <a href="http://blog.zabbix.com/highlights-of-zabbix-conference-2017-day-2/">blog</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/339920/">https://habr.com/ru/post/339920/</a></p>
