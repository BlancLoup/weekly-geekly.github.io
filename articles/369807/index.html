This, for example, cancer and diseases of the cardiovascular system.  The cost of treating such diseases in most countries is very high. <br><br>  Now companies that are engaged in the provision of health services are trying to optimize their work, reduce costs and improve the quality of patient care.  The five-year contract provides for a gradual transition in such organizations to value-oriented management.  The companies decided to work together, because Siemens has connections with hospitals around the world. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  IBM Watson Health provides computing power and proprietary services focused on healthcare work.

      ‚ÄúThey (Siemens, - ed.) Have powerful connections with hospitals, and they fully understand the workflow in hospitals and how the whole system works,‚Äù said Anil Jain, a spokesman for IBM, - Our company provides access to the IBM Watson Care Manager platform, which is designed to provide assistance to healthcare providers and patients.  The platform integrates hospital databases, including individual patient information.  Cognitive analysis is used to provide an individual approach to the treatment of patients. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe live in an amazing time of active development of health care.  Stable and emerging markets are constantly strengthening the focus on providing quality medical services for patients, ‚Äùsays Deborah Di Sanzo, Head of IBM Watson Health, Siemens and IBM are the ideal partners to work in this area with the promotion of individual health care in US and around the world. " <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/49a/4c4/59c/49a4c459cefb455bb78cf3009944054e.jpg"><br><br>  Both companies hope that the cooperation will result in high-quality positive changes in the health care sector, strengthening the fight against the growing prevalence of chronic diseases and gradual digitalization of health care. <br><br>  For several years now Watson has been actively involved in solving the most important tasks in the field of healthcare.  Not so long ago, thanks to the cognitive system, a ‚Äúsuper-weapon‚Äù was developed against viruses that are resistant to traditional antiviral drugs.  The macromolecules of this drug are excellent in combating several types of viruses, including Ebola pathogens, Dengue fever and herpes. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThere are a lot of viruses in the world, and all of them are quite complex.  A large number of viruses have an unstable genome that allows them to mutate quickly, ‚Äùsays James Hedrick, a leading researcher at IBM Research. <br><br>  And last year, CVS Health <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/47400.wss">joined forces</a> with IBM to develop a technology to predict the likelihood of diabetes and certain other chronic diseases in an individual.  This project is actively involved in the capabilities of the IBM Watson cognitive system with its capabilities for working with BigData. <br><br>  In addition, IBM Watson helps diagnose cancer and provides an individual approach for patients with various forms of cancer. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/369807/">https://habr.com/ru/post/369807/</a></p>
