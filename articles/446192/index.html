The results can be found <a href="https://www.acronis.com/ru-ru/pr/2019/03/31-09-55.html">on our website</a> .  Interestingly, according to the study, 92.7% of consumers reserve their data at least once a year - this is 24% more than a year earlier.  At the same time, 65% of respondents admitted that they or their relatives lost data over the past year by accident or due to hardware / software failures.  And this is almost 30% more than in 2018! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0d7/587/606/0d75876062a83ece5848776084c4b5d0.png"><br><br>  As you can see, even in the case of computer memory, backup does not help everyone.  What to say about a more complex and confusing historical memory.  Because of her omissions, many eminent minds do not receive due recognition either before or after death.  Their names and merits are completely forgotten, and discoveries are appropriated to third parties.

      In this post we will try to make a partial backup of historical memory and recall some almost forgotten scientists and inventors, the fruits of which we are reaping today.  And at the end - we will tell about our <i>new R &amp; D division in Bulgaria</i> , where we are actively recruiting specialists. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Antonio Meucci - the forgotten inventor of the phone </h2><br>  Most people are convinced that the inventor of the telephone service is the Scot Alexander Graham Bell.  Meanwhile, Bell did not have and has no right to be called the "father of telephony."  First discovered the method of transmitting sound through electricity and wires Antonio Meucci.  This Italian invented the phone completely by accident.  He conducted experiments in medicine and developed a method of treating people with electricity.  In one of the experiments, Antonio connected a generator, and his experimental loudly uttered some phrase.  To the surprise of Meucci, the assistant's voice was reproduced by the instrumentation.  The inventor began to understand what was the reason, and after a while he constructed the first prototype of the voice over wire system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/w8/ns/dz/w8nsdz5tikazd92ijrtgxfrb46a.jpeg"><br><br>  However, Antonio Meucci was not a successful businessman, and his discovery was simply stolen.  After the news about the invention of the Italian appeared in the press, a representative of the company Western Union came to the house of the scientist.  He was generous with compliments and offered Antonio a decent reward for his invention.  The gullible Italian immediately ‚Äúleaked‚Äù all the technical details of his prototelephone.  Some time later, Meucci received a stab in the back - a news item was published in the newspaper about Bell, who demonstrated the work of the telephone.  And the sponsor of his "show" was Western Union.  Antonio simply couldn‚Äôt prove his rights to the invention, he died on the cost of litigation. <br><br>  Only in 2002, the US Congress rehabilitated the name of the inventor by publishing resolution 269, in which Antonio Meucci is recognized as the present inventor of the telephone. <br><br><h2>  Rosalind Franklin - the discoverer of DNA </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/l9/yq/s3/l9yqs3zqqwqtuh4lj9snrtjkbqa.jpeg"><br><br>  English biophysicist and radiographer Rosalind Franklin is a vivid example of discrimination against women scientists.  In the scientific community of the middle of the last century, this was a frequent occurrence.  Rosalind studied the structure of DNA and the first to determine that DNA consists of two chains and a phosphate backbone.  Her discovery, confirmed by X-rays, she showed to her colleagues, Francis Crick and James Watson.  As a result, they received the Nobel Prize for the discovery of the DNA structure, and Rosalind Franklin was all undeservedly forgotten. <br><br><h2>  Boris Rosing - the real inventor of the TV </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/t6/51/x4/t651x4fxcuvyy81dnaku3pp_kqg.jpeg"><br><br>  Boris Rosing, a Russian scientist with Dutch roots, can be considered the father of television technology, because he was the first to design an electronic kinescope.  Although image transfer systems existed before the discovery of Boris Rosing, they all had a significant drawback ‚Äî they were partially mechanical. <br><br>  In the Rosing kinescope, the electron beam was deflected using the magnetic field of the induction coils.  The transmitting device used an inertialess photocell with an external photoelectric effect, and the receiving device was a cathode flux control system and a cathode ray tube with a fluorescent screen.  The Rosing system allowed to abandon the optical-mechanical devices for the transmission of images in favor of electronic. <br><br>  During the years of Soviet power, Boris Rosing fell under the distribution ‚Äî he was arrested for aiding counter-revolutionaries and exiled to the Arkhangelsk region without the right to work.  And although, thanks to the support of colleagues, a year later he managed to transfer to Arkhangelsk and enroll in the physics department of the Arkhangelsk Forestry Institute, his health was undermined - a year later he died.  The Soviet government did not spread about this, and the title of "inventor of the TV" went to the student of Boris Rosing Vladimir Zvorykin.  The latter, however, never hid the fact that he did all his inventions, developing the ideas of his teacher. <br><br><h2>  Lev Theremin - a diamond of Russian science </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b0d/522/3ed/b0d5223ed0feed5f9b56724a468f45ed.jpg"><br><br>  The name of this scientist is connected with many curious inventions that would be enough for a real spy novel.  Among them are the musical instrument, the Termenvox, the television program ‚ÄúFar-Sighted‚Äù, unmanned aerial vehicles, controlled by radio (prototypes of modern cruise missiles), the Buran system, which read information from the glass vibration in the room.  But the most loud invention of Theremin is the transmitting device ‚ÄúZlatoust‚Äù, which for seven years supplied secret information straight from the working room of the US ambassador to the USSR. <br><br>  The design of "Chrysostom" was unique.  He, as a detector receiver, worked on the energy of radio waves, thanks to which the US intelligence services could not detect the device for so long.  The Soviet special services irradiated the building of the US embassy at a resonator frequency with a powerful source, after which the device ‚Äúturned on‚Äù and began to broadcast the sound from the ambassador‚Äôs office. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/96e/d26/101/96ed26101aa9707d3895cd895ae5609c.jpg"><br><br>  The "bug" was hidden in a decorative carved copy of the Great Seal of the United States, which was presented to the American ambassador by the pioneers of "Artek".  Bookmark found completely by accident.  But even after that, American experts for a long time could not understand exactly how it works.  It took a year and a half to Western scientists to deal with this task and make at least an approximate working analogue of Chrysostom. <br><br><h2>  Dieter Rams: Apple Electronics Design Mastermind </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/n-/fy/qf/n-fyqf49i_ufez7i2yscqlp1gt8.jpeg"><br><br>  The name of Dieter Rams is associated with the company Braun, in which he worked as an industrial designer from 1962 to 1995.  However, if you believe that the design of the equipment developed under his leadership is hardly relevant, you are mistaken. <br><br>  It is worth exploring the early work of Rams, and it becomes clear from where the designers of Apple drew their inspiration.  For example, the Braun T3 pocket radio is very similar to the design of early iPod models.  The Power Mac G5 system unit looks almost one-in-one like a Braun T1000 radio.  Compare yourself: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7a7/4ca/1ab/7a74ca1ab161baff17d9dd7e88117405.jpg"><br><br>  It was Dieter Rams who unmistakably formulated the main principles of modern design ‚Äî practicality, simplicity, and reliability.  On their basis, almost all modern electronic devices are being developed that have smoothed shapes and contain a minimum of elements. <br><br>  By the way, Rams also set some principles for the use of color in electronics.  In particular, he came up with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmarking the record button in red and invented a color indication of the sound level, which changes its color as the amplitude increases. <br><br><h2>  William Mogridge and Alan Kay: forefathers of modern laptops </h2><br>  Alan Curtis Kay is another designer whose work has determined the appearance of personal computers and the interface philosophy of modern technology.  With the advent of microelectronics, it became clear that a computer is no longer a room filled with cabinets.  And it was Alan who invented the concept of the first laptop computer.  In the layout of its Dynabook, created in 1968, you can easily guess a modern laptop and tablet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9dd/452/5c8/9dd4525c8bdf99a6cecc76fe70b5a39d.jpg"><br><br>  Another person, thanks to whom the familiar devices look like this, and not otherwise, is William Grant Mogridge.  In 1979, he invented the articulated folding mechanism of a laptop.  The same mechanism was later used in clamshell phones, game consoles, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ba5/fa9/f01/ba5fa9f01df68a071ea3781f737a9d22.jpg"><br><br>  Fortunately, today talented inventors have many opportunities to tell about themselves and their works - thanks, the Internet.  We in Acronis are also working to ensure that various important information is not lost.  And we will be happy if you help us with this. <br><br><h2>  Welcome to Acronis Bulgaria </h2><br>  Acronis currently has 27 offices, with more than 1,300 employees.  Last year, Acronis acquired T-Soft, in connection with which a new R &amp; D center Acronis Bulgaria opened in Sofia, which should become the company's largest development office in the future. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/786/aa9/417/786aa94170b3e31f6da5c636302ed399.png"><br><br>  For three years, we plan to invest $ 50 million in the new center and expand the staff to 300 people.  We <a href="https://www.acronis.com/en-us/careers/">are looking for</a> many different specialists who will develop cyber defense technologies, support data center operations and develop relevant products and services - these are Python / Go / C ++ developers, support engineers, Q &amp; A and more. <br><br>  In the process of moving, we help new employees with documents, taxes, interaction with the authorities and generally advise on all issues.  We pay one-way tickets for the whole family of the employee, housing allowance and children, and also allocate an additional amount for the arrangement of the apartment and the housing deposit.  Finally, we organize acquaintance with the country and language training, help open a bank account, find a school / gym and other institutions.  And, of course, we leave contacts in case of emergency. <br><br>  A full list of vacancies is available <a href="https://www.acronis.com/en-us/careers/">here</a> , and you can send your resume on the same page.
