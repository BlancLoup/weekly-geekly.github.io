By experience and reviews on the forums, this is not a 100% ban, but it cuts off all commercial fraudsters.

      The ‚ÄúContent ban‚Äù option is not advertised by the operator, it is not in the standard lists for tariff plans.  You can connect either by calling the hotline (with a code word) or in person at the MTS offices. <br><br>  You can separately disable SMS 1) To short numbers;  2) Long distance / international (thanks <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/mihmig/" class="user_link">mihmig</a> ). <br><br>  There <a href="http://sms911.ru/">is a feedback form</a> for complaints.

I emphasize - without a written statement.  No SMS, clicking links, etc.  a written statement, of course, are not.  Accordingly, it makes sense to visit the office and conclude such an additional agreement by attaching to it a list of already connected services. </blockquote><br><br><h1>  Megaphone </h1><br>  There are services of the Moscow MegaFon called <a href="http://moscow.megafon.ru/services/content/stop_content/about.html">‚ÄúSTOP-content‚Äù</a> .
