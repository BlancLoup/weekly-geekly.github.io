  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The system of online counseling program 1C for users</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Quite a bit ago, during the period of active growth of social networks, the idea was popular that the general social networks were built, and now social networks will be built on the interests and inside the closed communities.  Then we attempted to build a network for 1C users and were defeated due to poor knowledge of Web programming, lack of understanding of community structure and other things. <br>  Then, expert communities, mutual aid societies with questions and answers to specific topics began to be actively built.  However, over time, it became clear that without high-quality content, these communities also quickly bent.  The idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãUGC has a little shattered its former brilliance.  Then I first visited the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbuilding a high-quality website with questions and answers to a specific topic, where the answers are collected from disparate sources, brought to a common denominator, enriched and provided to help the user. <br>  As I mentioned, I‚Äôm not good at WEB programming, but I‚Äôm familiar with first-hand and the latest versions of this platform do quite well with many things that I lacked in previous versions of 1C. <br>  As a result, a concept of a consulting system with answers to questions on 1C was developed, which is presented below. <br>  I warn you in advance that this is a concept and many purely technical things have not yet been verified.  One of the main features of the system is that the user sits in a familiar environment and does not need to go to any site.  The opinion of a respected community on whether or not it flies is interesting, and why. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The name of the system 1C: HERE (questions and answers)

      The purpose of the system: To enable any specialist working with 1C to quickly get an answer or advice on working with 1C. <br><br>  Tasks of the system: <br><br>  1. The counseling system should operate online via the Internet.  Those.  consultations will be available for those who have an Internet connection <br><br>  2. Consultation will take place through access to the database of questions - answers on 1C, in which the user independently searches for a question that is similar, correlated or is the one that arose with him and reads the answer to the question previously submitted to the system <br><br>  3. The system works according to the freemium model.  Level 1-3 questions per month for free.  3-5 questions extended account and 6-50 questions premium account.  In addition, it will be possible to buy an answer to a specific question through an SMS payment system at minimum rates. <br><br>  4. Each pair of question - the answer will be placed in a specific directory according to the general classification of questions - answers.  The tag system will not be applied in the first releases. <br><br>  5. Any user can add their own question to the database, which appears in the queue for consideration and entry into the database, or an indication of a ready answer.  Owners of paid accounts will have the priority right to submit their questions.  Submission of questions may be unlimited, but access to answers follows the general rules for receiving answers and the freemium system. <br><br>  Technical implementation of the system <br><br>  1. The system is implemented as a separate configuration 1C.  This configuration is distributed free of charge on an ‚Äúas is‚Äù basis.  All code is open to change.  Updates for this database are free and are distributed to everyone in the form of an update file and a complete configuration file.  The configurations installed on Clients are called client ones, and the configuration of the central node of the knowledge base is called server.  Configurations are developed for the 1C 8.1 platform.  and 1C 8.2 <br><br>  2. Server configuration is written on 1C 8.2 platform.  and is a modified version of the configuration 1C Business School. <br><br>  3. Data exchange between the client and the server is carried out using the xml format.  Information about client accessibility, server availability, server receiving information about the client, transfer of an access password to answers takes part in the exchange. <br><br>  4. The client receives a list of sections and a description of all questions via RSS. <br><br>  5. The answer to the question becomes available to the Client also via RSS. <br><br>  How does the work in the system. <br><br>  1. After installing the configuration, the client enters into the configuration their personal, personal data.  Such as name, organization name, legal data, payment details and sends a request to connect to the central database <br>  2. The central database accepts the request from the Client, memorizes the credentials of the client, generates for it a unique ID code and informs it to the client. <br>  3. The client enters his ID code in his client configuration and generates a request to connect to the full database. <br>  4. The server recognizes the connection request with the ID that it has in the database and changes the status of the Client to connected and notifies the Client about it. <br>  5. The client sees that the server is connected and ready to work.  requests an updated resource catalog <br>  6. The server gives RSS the structure of folders and questions. <br>  7. The client completely sees the structure of folders and sections within his configuration and searches for the section of interest and questions.  which is in its section. <br>  8. If the Client sees that the interested question is in the database, he requests an answer to it from the server. <br>  9. The server compares the number of issued answers to the ID that requested it, identifies the ID and the client, as well as his data plan.  If the tariff plan or the number of remaining free answers allows you to give a response to the Client, then the server sends the answer to the Client. <br>  10. The client receives the answer and applies it in practice, necessarily evaluates it.  Answers with a rating of less than 4 points should be adjusted, and with a rating of less than 3 points completely revised with clarification from the Client what exactly caused such a low score <br>  11. Communication between the operators of the central base and the base of the Client passes through the HMRD protocol. <br>  12. Personal communication by phone is considered an extraordinary event and should be reduced to zero. <br><br>  Further development of the system: <br><br>  1. The ability of each client to search and add another Client based on his personal data (the type of accounting is entered, the scope of activities, etc.) and to conduct a dialogue between Customers through the server while preserving the history on the Server. <br>  2. The ability to give and change unused free access to the database of answers <br>  3. Possibility of distributed forum (fido?) <br>  4. The ability to download to your laptop a full image of the system with pre-installed accounting software. <br>  5. An opportunity to receive additions to a configuration by downloading from a special catalog of checked and selected additions. <br>  6. The possibility of passing a training course or a set of tests <br>  7. The possibility of obtaining VIZARDOV - step by step assistants for carrying out complex multi-stage accounting operation. <br>  ... <br>  8. And other, and other and other ... <br><br>  Tasks for the creators of the system <br>  1. Technical implementation of the system should be flawless and work on weak channels ensuring low traffic volume <br>  2. Filling the database of questions and answers should be as complete as possible. <br>  3. The format of the description of questions and answers should be as user-friendly as possible with a full description of the menu paths, screenshots and clarifications that take into account the ramification of events. <br><br>  Total.  We hope to create this system in the near future.  And for a long time I was afraid to tell my ideas and as a result, they were often not realized.  Therefore.  if someone wants to participate, we will be happy to cooperate, and if someone wants to do it himself: more correctly and intelligently, we will be happy to use.  Thank! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/90746/">https://habr.com/ru/post/90746/</a></p>
