  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Social network as a way to improve yourself</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For those who have already formed their understanding and attitude to social networks, it is time to think about how they can be used for the benefit of their lives. <br><br>  The first thing that comes to mind is the use of the social network as a source of motivation.  For example, you write in <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/">LJ</a> post - ‚ÄúFrom Monday I start to get up at 6 am.  Please, who works at night shift, call me at 6.15.  If I haven't woken up yet, I‚Äôve got a bottle from me. ‚Äù <br>  Of course, there will be a lot of people willing to help you, in the experiment, not only your direct friends, but also fans from the side, and just lovers of freebies will take an active part.  And you don‚Äôt want to give a bottle of oh ... So, your goal becomes more significant, motivation grows and the probability of success also increases in proportion to the number of people tied to the event. <br><br>  In real life, the organization of such a classical ‚Äústimulus-response‚Äù scheme in psychology ( <a href="http://www.psychology.ru/whoswho/Clark_Hull.stm">Clark Hull's methodology</a> ), in addition to your goal, would have been associated with the difficulties of a long and tedious search and persuasion of suitable people, which might have nullified the very desire to get up to 6 a.m.

      But increasing the motivation of social networking resources are not exhausted.  One of the most wonderful opportunities is to change yourself through the selection of your environment. <br><br>  So, being an <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA">impassable gopnik</a> , a person, having <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA">got an</a> account in a LiveJournal and having difficulty sorting out the mechanism of franding, first of all adds to his friends the same Gopnik, like himself, which is logical.  And everything would be good, or rather, terribly bad, if the social network did not have an extremely limited opportunity in ordinary life to join the circle of people who are several steps up the social ladder above you.  They have more knowledge.  More experience.  More money in the end.  And since they have all this, it means that they know how to make their own lives better than the existence of an impassable gopnik. <br><br>  And the most impassable gopnik, if he has the curiosity to zafrendit at least one such <a href="http://mt1kf.livejournal.com/profile">VIP-person</a> , without any difficulty and completely free of charge gets the opportunity to hear the thoughts of his wise contemporary.  It would be foolish to say that this does not affect the consciousness - everything, and I including, thanks to social networks, went through a rethinking of their original reference group, whether it be a <a href="http://code.pp.ru/soft/Demos/">demo scene</a> or an <a href="http://www.aikikai.ru/index17.html">aikido club</a> .  The ficus here is that the space organized by you begins to have a beneficial effect on yourself. <br><br>  It is like a social feng shui, when autonomous sources-generators of thoughts, information and life experience located in a certain order are combined into a complete, controlled system.  You can identify weak elements and replace them with stronger ones, look for catalysts that give the strongest effect for you. <br><br>  Such an approach to changing oneself through a critical analysis of one‚Äôs social circle was popularized by <a href="http://www.kulichki.com/moshkow/KARNEGY/">Dale Carnegie</a> , but it was never so easy to see before social networks.  It is enough to find in any social network, at least in the same LJ, those you want to be like - and start changing yourself. <br><br>  So, you see, social networks will soon become a highly effective tool for managing their lives for high-performance people. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4596/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4596/</a></p>
