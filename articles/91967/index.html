(Part 1)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello, Habraland!  I learned about your existence and immediately wanted to visit you.  But you were under lock and key.  I was saddened by this outcome, but I quickly realized that you were the best that I saw, which means that you know what you are doing.  I opened my mouth and looked with genuine curiosity from behind the fence at your children, who were frolicking somewhere in the depths of the yard, playing with their toys and riding on their merry-go-rounds - with enthusiasm and virtuosity.  I wish I also, I thought, walking timidly towards your gates ... <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Step 0</b> <br>  Start <br><img src="http://s39.radikal.ru/i084/1004/6d/f2f148d4753a.png" alt="image" align="left"><br><br>  This article, consisting of a chain of thoughts, I will try to deprive you, <b>% username%</b> , of a virgin glance, turning it on seemingly unrelated topics!

      Being an active user of the global network, I once realized, being in my right mind and hard memory, that there is no more my strength to read second-rate, cloacatic junk that pops up in the window of my browser as a lifeless character set a la ‚ÄúArticle for beginners ...‚Äù. <br><br>  <i><font color="#9C9C9C">So, I ended up here.</font></i>  <i><font color="#9C9C9C">And it was you, Habr, sobered up my mind.</font></i> <br><br>  Not only do newbies break their eyes on these soulless formal replies, which are often presented not for those who ‚Äúdon‚Äôt know, but really want to,‚Äù but also besiege the forums with seemingly elementary questions, which often arise from incorrectly interpreted information, gleaned from read articles. <br><br>  <b>From this thesis follows the essence of my article, which I have divided into several parts, namely:</b> <br><ol><li>  I will make an attempt to realize who those newbies are and what they are. </li><li> Also, I will express my opinion about the quality of computer-related articles wandering on the Internet and intended for beginners.  What influence they have on them ( <code>     </code> ). </li></ol><br>  If the first point is just an attempt to classify characters and my curiosity, then the second is a pure claim! <br><br>  <b>Step I</b> <br>  Newbie detected <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6bb/cc2/25b/6bbcc225b23b8876a1522cd1614e395c.jpg" alt="image" align="left"><br><br>  Oh, those newbies!  They multiply and grow with unimaginable speed, filling all the forums available to them with the same type of questions that cause nausea to a slight attack of long-livers, which make the fingers of the latter automatically type phrases: <br><br>  <code>‚Äú,   Google/yandex/bing ?‚Äù</code> , Or <br>  <code>‚Äú ‚Äù</code> , or <br> <code>‚Äú     Google/yandex/bing?   ,         ?‚Äù</code>  <code>‚Äú     Google/yandex/bing?   ,         ?‚Äù</code> Etc. <br><br>  Quotes can be cited endlessly and they will all be judgmental.  There are often cases where particularly zealous users are sent to such links that are beaten and worn to holes, such as: <br><br><blockquote>  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/yd4pocz">tinyurl.com/yd4pocz</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.segfault.kiev.ua/smart-questions-ru.html">www.segfault.kiev.ua/smart-questions-ru.html</a> <br>  <a href="http://justfuckinggoogleit.com/">justfuckinggoogleit.com</a> <br>  ‚ÄúRead the forum rules‚Äù <br></blockquote><br>  and others like them ... <br><br>  Definitely everyone encounters this every day! <br>  The question is, who are these people, forcing indignant =)? <br><br><h5>  <b>I will give background information that I found on the network:</b> </h5><br><br><blockquote>  <b>A newbie</b> or popularly a <b>noob</b> (English, slang, a distortion of a <b>newbie</b> ) is ‚Äúa <i>person who doesn‚Äôt fumble at anything</i> ‚Äù. <br>  <b>Synonyms</b> : lamer, lol, stupid, nubyar. <br></blockquote><br><br>  Since there is a kind of user such as <b>noob / newbie / newbie</b> , then we will try to single out on its basis several types that I have met on the vast expanses of Ineta. <br><br><h5>  Analysis of the varieties of beginners, I reduced to this structure: </h5><br><ul><li>  <b>Definition of species</b> - in this paragraph, I give a description of this type of newcomers. </li><li>  <b>An example</b> - I give the characteristic for this type of way to ask questions. </li><li>  <b>Answer</b> - I give examples of how this type of juzverej answer the questions they asked. </li></ul><br><br> <code>(     !)</code> <br> <h4>  And so, let's get started.  In my opinion, Noobs are: </h4><br><br><ol><li>  <b>Full noobs</b> are a type of users, completely or partially separated from the world of computers (and all that is connected with them).  This world for them is something akin to the supernatural.  Pressing a key for them is always accompanied by an inner experience to spoil something. <br>  <code>‚Äú ,   -,   ()   :)</code> ,‚Äù thinks such a user. <br>  In general, such users are older people, or those who have missed technical progress, sitting in the attic with a clogged viewing window. <br><br>  These, as a rule, do not sit on forums, do not read articles, and use a computer only, for example, to watch a movie that someone will turn on to them, because  they themselves do not know how to do it.  But, very often they completely deny the possibility of watching movies on a computer screen, referring to the fact that the screen is too small, the sound is not the same, and your ‚Äúcomputer‚Äù is harmful.  But enlightenment happens, and such users grow from full noobs to something bigger.  This usually happens when, in a family where there was no computer before, it appears.  Or, a new job requires skills to use it. <br><br>  <i><b><font color="#9C9C9C">&lt;Example&gt;</font></b></i> Such a type of users, having seized upon the forums, immediately attracts attention with not the ability to formulate a question, overloading their posts with emoticons and all sorts of other signs (what to say, emotions from new opportunities dominate the mind). <br><br> <code>"    ,  ?‚Äù <br> ‚Äú   -    ‚Ä¶‚Äù <br> ‚Äú ,       ?‚Äù <br> ‚Äú !!!!   ?????????? ‚Äú</code> <br> <br>  <i><b><font color="#9C9C9C">&lt;Answer&gt;</font></b></i> With such people, as a rule, do not stand on ceremony and spread to them the whole truth-womb, as it is!  Usually, this is irony, ridicule, where there is often not enough space for a simple answer to, albeit stupid, but a beginner's question! <br><br> <code>‚Äú    ?    , &lt;br&gt;   windows,     .‚Äù <br> ‚Äú  ,     ,&lt;br&gt;   "    !   !"&lt;br&gt;</code> <br> </li><li>  <b>Disposable -</b> this is the type of users for whom you need to do something / find at once for the sake of: evaluation at school / institute, self-satisfaction, conquering others with something that would be (!).  In such, as a rule, the number of posts does not exceed a dozen.  After receiving the answer to your question, the further communication on the forum, for the most part, does not interest them. <br><br>  <i><b><font color="#9C9C9C">&lt;Example&gt;</font></b></i> Anyone can fall under this definition.  Very often something is needed at once - there is nothing reprehensible in it. <br><br> <code>"    ?&lt;br&gt;        ‚Ä¶‚Äù <br> ‚Äú   ‚Ä¶‚Äù <br> ‚Äú       ‚Ä¶‚Äù</code> <br> <br>  <i><b><font color="#9C9C9C">&lt;Answer&gt;</font></b></i> What can I say, they are either helped or not - it all depends on the mood of the respondents, on the correctness and completeness of the question, on the attitude towards the questioner! <br><br></li><li>  <b>The whimpers</b> are those who try to convince the users of the necessary information.  As a rule, schoolchildren and others are begging.  They, like the full noobs, have many different signs and emoticons, but not from emotions, but from general illiteracy and a desire to somehow draw attention to themselves. <br><br>  <i><b><font color="#9C9C9C">&lt;Example&gt;</font></b></i> Snot, nagging, pleading - this is their strong point. <br><br> <code>‚Äú             !‚Äù <br> ‚Äú     ?       !‚Äù <br> ‚Äú  !!!!!!!!  !!!!!‚Äù</code> <br> <br>  <i><b><font color="#9C9C9C">&lt;Answer&gt;</font></b></i> Out of pity for them, many make concessions and help, but as a rule, it often takes place to be the answer that no one will do anything for you. <br><br> <code>‚Äú ,   ,       . <br>       ,     . <br>    Google/yandex/bing   -  -  .‚Äù</code> <br> <br></li><li>  <b>Swingers (from downloading rights)</b> are those who require (!) To give them the necessary information, as a rule, doing this unconsciously - an insufficiently developed culture of communication on the Internet affects. <br><br>  <i><b><font color="#9C9C9C">&lt;Example&gt;</font></b></i> This is one of the main mistakes of newbies - they require. <br><br> <code>‚Äú  , ‚Ä¶‚Äù <br> ‚Äú   -  ?‚Äù <br> ‚Äú     .....     "  ......" , <br>        ....   .....    ...‚Äù <br> ‚Äú *...  * ?     ?  ... ? ‚Äù</code> <br> <br>  <i><b><font color="#9C9C9C">&lt;Answer&gt;</font></b></i> Such people, naturally, are not loved, they are rude, offended, to which they respond with the same coin.  But noobs do not put a finger in their mouths, they think that everyone owes them something, someone must do something for them. <br><br> <code>‚Äú,  ,        , <br>        .‚Äù <br> ‚Äú    -  ,  ,       . <br>       ,  ,    - .‚Äú <br> ‚Äú -       ,     ?‚Äù <br> ‚Äú  ,         ‚Äù</code> <br> <br></li><li>  <b>Nedotrolli</b> - (poor quality evolution of <b>rocking players</b> ) - these are those who supposedly already know something, but having a mess in their head from not meaningful knowledge, they throw discussions at the forum, trying to make everyone understand that every phrase is an affirmation of truth at any time may be, according to the author, confirmed by competent sources.  I got this type of newbies quite recently.  For which I am grateful to him. <br><br>  <i><b><font color="#9C9C9C">&lt;Example&gt;</font></b></i> And these are not trolls.  They are not trying to offend anyone, to assert themselves at the expense of others or to make them so hated.  Not.  This type of newbies simply doesn‚Äôt understand with its maximalistic-school logic logic that their writing can lead to something they don‚Äôt suspect.  They are always on their own minds, often simply writing what they think, ignoring the clarifying questions of people who are trying to help them. <br><br> <code>‚Äú  "    "   -   -  . &lt;br&gt;  -  !         . ‚Äù <br> ‚Äú %username%,    . !   --.‚Äù</code> <br> <br>  <i><b><font color="#9C9C9C">&lt;Answer&gt;</font></b></i> As a result, they are simply sent into three letters for arrogance by all who feel like it, but at the same time they think that they are biased against them, they are trying to humiliate, ridicule.  As a result, the topic quickly acquires flood until the moderator intervenes. <br><br> <code>‚Äú,    ? :) ‚Äú <br> ‚Äú  ,  ,     . <br>         ,&lt;br&gt;      .‚Äù <br> ‚Äú    ...    ?‚Äù</code> <br> <br></li><li>  <b>Adequats</b> are more or less literate beginners who describe their problem in detail and meticulously, often correcting a written post a lot, afraid to look misunderstood or ridiculous in the eyes of other members of the forum. <br><br>  <i><b><font color="#9C9C9C">&lt;Example&gt;</font></b></i> They, as a rule, ask very specific questions, try to read the forum rules whenever possible to publish a post, so that they do not get into a mess, they know that the more clearly and correctly a question is asked, the sooner the answer will be received.  This kind of users, basically, quickly become attached to a forum and visit it even after receiving a response. <br><br>  <i><b><font color="#9C9C9C">&lt;Answer&gt;</font></b></i> It is pleasant to deal with such newbies, they are happy to answer.  This is the backbone of any forum. </li></ol><hr><br>  I also met people who, not knowing, for example, any programming language, but having a desire to have some delusional, cool, self-written application, did the following: They broke their problem into parts, asked to write in different forums another piece of their program and then, apparently, collected it into something whole and enjoyed life. <br>  To the question, wtf man? <br>  They answered that they were learning the language in this way and that they liked it. <br><br>  I understand that learning it by solving another practical task is gud, but without putting even the slightest effort into mastering the elementary syntax of the ‚Äústudied‚Äù language, they demanded that someone do something for them without providing the lines of the code of what they have already tried to do on their own are the height of insolence. <br><br>  And they respond to such critical statements: <blockquote> <code>‚Äù    ,    .  ,    ‚Äù?</code> </blockquote> <br>  As a result, they are minus, and if it comes to the extreme, the admin can simply ban for persistence in writing nonsense. <br><br>  <b>Step II</b> <br>  the end <br><br>  <i><b><font color="#9C9C9C">Summarize</font></b></i> <br><br>  Beginners are such entities that quickly catch fire with something, run to the forum, want, without making any effort to achieve something, with the heat and heat they publish another govnost and to their own perplexity they realize that ‚Äúevil‚Äù people live there , in every possible way sending them to the forest through the text, something like this: <br><blockquote> <code>‚Äú   ,      ,   ,      .       ,   ,     ‚Äù!</code> </blockquote>  This is how people briefly and clearly make it clear to them that in principle they themselves will be able to solve their problem, only for this you need to strain a little. <br><br>  So it turns out that before them, no party of users, for sure, appealed for help with such problems.  But all is in vain, as if they do not notice anything except their own persona - typical egoism and disrespect, and perhaps the lack of communication skills on the Internet and a common culture. <br><br>  Why does it happen that the information accumulated over the years turns out to be unclaimed by those who need it? <br><br>  Do you think it's all about users?  Yes.  Undoubtedly, but most of all - the matter is in the information itself and in its presentation.  And in my next article, I will try to analyze it. <br><br>  <b>To be continued ...</b> <br><br>  ps: I want to express my gratitude to the user <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/boomburum/" class="user_link">Boomburum</a> , who gave me an invite.  Thank! <br><br>  Notes on the article, indications of errors - in a personal, please. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/91967/">https://habr.com/ru/post/91967/</a></p>
