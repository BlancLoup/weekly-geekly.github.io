  <section class="page js-page"><h1>WakeMate Smart Wakeup Personal Experience</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Greetings,% username% <br><br>  Recently, there have been many discussions on Habr√© of all sorts of ‚Äúsmart‚Äù sleep alarm clocks, which use the method of actigraphy (i.e., determining the sleep phase using an accelerometer, which monitors the mobility of a hand in a dream and associates it with the sleep phase.) in a dream, an alarm clock defines as a phase of fast sleep). <br>  Initially, the purpose of the purchase was: to facilitate the morning awakening because I do not regularly go to bed and roll for 10-20 minutes before getting up. <br>  Before buying it, I chose it among several devices, including the Sleeptracker.  In choosing factors were taken into account: price, compatibility, comfort in use, an online service for monitoring sleep (but as it turned out later, this is a complete garbage) <br>  Also <s>deceived</s> bribed me the following <a href="http://wakemate.com/compare/">comparison plate with competitors</a> <br>  Ie wakemate allegedly ahead of all competitors in terms of comfort, portability, the ability to automatically download data, exhaustive means for analyzing sleep, the duration of the "window" during which the device will try to wake up. <br>  Colleagues at work expressed their opinion about the device as follows: it is not reliable or the battery will sit down or the bluetooth connection with the phone will break.  I did not listen to them and decided to take a chance ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Principle of operation</b> <br>  The wakemate version for iOS and Android is on sale, i.e.  use the same bracelet with two operating systems will not work.  The device consists of the iron bracelet itself with a battery and 2 LEDs (the LED is lit continuously green - there is a bluetooth connection between the bracelet and the phone, it flashes green - there is no connection or it is lost and the red charge indicator LED) and software.  With the google market (play) or appstore, the free wakemate program is downloaded.  When you first start the program, pairing of two devices via Bluetooth occurs (the default code, if I'm not mistaken, is 1234).  Developers on the site assure that the battery lasts for 24 hours or 2-3 nights.  In fact, my battery died after 20-23 hours (and this is because I forgot to turn off the bracelet after waking up) <br>  <b>Purchase and delivery</b> <br>  I bought a bracelet for Anroid in May last year for $ 60.  The first problem is that wakemate is delivered only to Canada, the USA and Europe, since I live in Kazakhstan, I ordered it via Shipito mail forwarding service. <br><br>  <b>Equipment</b> <br>  The bracelet itself, the battery (it is necessary to insert the bracelet into it), a leaflet with brief instructions and that's it.

      <b>Experience of use</b> <br>  On the bracelet was the inscription wakemate (photo no), a week later it was worn out. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0f4/ce3/e24/0f4ce3e24397893eff5ae75718892368.jpg"><br>  In total, the bracelet was used continuously for about 1.5-2 weeks.  Suppose I have to get up at 7.00, the alarm clock will try to wake me up from 6.40 to 7.00, and this interval of 20 minutes cannot be changed for the android version (for ipad, you can).  For all the time of use, the bracelet always woke me up at the latest time of the 20-minute interval, i.e.  at 7.00.  And the first week of use, I woke up myself 20-30 minutes before waking up.  I put it on my left hand (on the site it is indicated that it is necessary to wear on a non-dominant hand) Often (about 30% of the total time of use) in the morning there was an error "There seems to be a problem with reconnecting to the Wakemate.Please plug the device ‚ÄúThere was an error when connecting to the bracelet, please plug in the bracelet to charge, turn it on and off and click Continue to restore the sleep data.‚Äù <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e50/830/0a7/e508300a7afffc9f19b618f1c4d812cf.jpg">  Naturally, in the morning, when you get woken up, it breaks very much to practice these dances with a tambourine, especially to look for a charger.  At the same time, the connection status indicator is continuously green.  I turned off the key fob and turned it on, after pressing continue another error occurred. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9a3/1c5/ebd/9a31c5ebd5b3c29eaf43031d65e0f491.jpg"><br>  After clicking Try again, nothing happened, in general, an endless loop :) <br><br>  <b>Online analytics software</b> <br>  If you register on the site wakemate.com and in the smartphone program to drive in your data, in the morning the program will try to merge sleep monitoring data overnight onto the site. <br>  On the site you can see a beautiful picture and diagrams: <br>  How many awakenings I had during the night, how long it took to fall asleep, the actual sleep time and the quality of sleep (sleep score) in the ‚Äúparrots‚Äù (the more - the better) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1b0/300/796/1b03007962e003a186f35d7ac4dfd5bd.png"><br><br>  actually the <a href="http://www.wakemate.com/">site of the</a> device itself <br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br>  For me, this device worked like a normal alarm clock  Awakened at the same time that I indicated in the program, not taking into account the sleep phase.  I don‚Äôt know whether the problem is with my copy or with all of them. <br>  In one of the reviews of Sleeptracker, someone mentioned the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A5%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D1%258D%25D1%2584%25D1%2584%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582">effect of a hot-chorve</a> ie. <br>  ‚ÄúThese are conditions in which novelty, interest in an experiment, or heightened attention to this matter lead to a distorted, often too favorable result.  The participants in the experiment act differently, more diligently than usual, only due to the realization that they are involved in the experiment. ‚Äù  I think that this effect also applies to WakeMate, and indeed to any similar devices with accelerometers.  The device does not justify the investment in it and is not recommended for purchase. <br><br>  <b>add 31.03.2012</b> <br>  last night I fully charged the device, activated the alarm clock and put it next to the phone at a distance of 10 cm - the battery did not live until 9.00 (from 24.00) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a27/17f/d1f/a2717fd1ff7a3a2a8ed221d0220cc763.jpg"><br><br> <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/vp"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a1a/bb8/6ef/a1abb86ef1faa35e01779c9805ddbbfc.gif" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  <b>Our other publications:</b> <br>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/270698/">Overview of the powerful tablet Chuwi Hi10 on a full Win10 for $ 180</a> <br>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/270254/">15 little things from heaven about which you would like to know</a> <br>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/271064/">15 cool little things for the geek from the Middle Kingdom.</a>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/271064/">Part 2</a> <br>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/269722/">Classes of quadcopters - which are and are used for</a> <br>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/270618/">Seven current copters up to $ 20, which can be put in your pocket</a> <br>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/269498/">Our little joy or budget than to please yourself on February 23?</a> <br>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/269526/">Xiaomi company.</a>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/269526/">Cheaper without damage to quality is no longer</a> <br>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/267722/">Chuwi Ilife V5 - a $ 99 robot vacuum cleaner or how to turn daily cleaning into entertainment</a> <br>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/266778/">NEJE engraver laser overview or promising business model</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/141046/">https://habr.com/ru/post/141046/</a></p>
