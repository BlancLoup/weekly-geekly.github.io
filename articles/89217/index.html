      Greetings to you again, dear habrovtsy! <br>  In the second part of our review we will discuss how the driver application is arranged, what are the obvious advantages in it, and what they are. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>1. Again about dispatchers.</b>  I do not presume to talk about all the taxi services in our country, some thousands, but at least, studying reviews on the Internet and numerous conversations with drivers led to the conclusion that drivers are not friends with dispatchers.  Shouts, mate, controversy, and so on - quite a common thing.  It was even possible not to collect reviews, I heard a lot on the radio.  The level of comfort from such a "service" drops sharply. <br><br>  By the way, my interest was also aroused by reviews of those who no longer use the radio, but use a cell phone.  The picture is about the same, but for the most part, in the office of the taxi service. <br><br>  Now this is not all, as well as the dispatchers themselves.  Our system is almost completely automated.  With the exception of certain points that require action, observation and analysis of the taxi service manager.  But the dispatchers managed to completely eliminate, for which thousands of drivers in our vast country will thank. <br><br>  <b>2.</b> You can register as a driver in a taxi on the official website, or on the websites of taxi partners.  The registration procedure takes no more than 5 minutes.  Thanks to the daily analysis and customer reviews, the driver base will acquire every day more and more professional staff, which will greatly affect the quality of services. <br><br>  <b>3.</b> After registration, you need to select a city and enter the specified login and password into the application downloaded to the phone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7e3/4d1/292/7e34d1292247505a69245408b3fe2ee5.png" alt="Taxi in the mobile"><br><br>  <i>The application remembers the entered data and the next time they are no longer required.</i> <br><br>  <b>4.</b> As a plus, you can note the fixed cost of the application, and not a percentage of the trip, the latter is not very true.  <b>Buy applications can be through any terminal QIWI</b> .  Detailed instructions are on the official site. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fd5/e2b/083/fd5e2b0836406d52ba62b33f6ceae09f.png" alt="Taxi in the mobile"><br><br>  <b>5.</b> First you need to check whether the data about the car is entered correctly (the driver indicated them during registration), then set your prices and specify the default price method.  This application also remembers and automatically transfers to the client.  You can show a bit of originality to more often choose you.  (With open testing, such car names as PrioraDVD or VAZ 2110 Tuning were noticed).  Adding such a ‚Äúhighlight‚Äù can give more chances that the client will choose such a driver, if, for example, the price is the same. <br><br>  <b>6.</b> Instead of communicating with the dispatcher and listening to the radio, you can watch the applications submitted on the phone screen.  When a new application arrives, the phone vibrates and beeps. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d03/e94/12c/d03e9412cc7a728c3a8aab08aa073106.png" alt="Taxi in the mobile"><br><br>  The obvious advantage is the independent choice of the application.  Select the application and click on it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/36e/9f7/702/36e9f7702279a22e6b54a53e85d5deb9.png" alt="Taxi in the mobile"><br><br>  Here you can see not only the address, but also the wishes of the client.  If you wanted to take this application, specify the time and price.  If the client chooses you, the application will be happy to notify about it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2b4/94d/10c/2b494d10c479e3a3a550fc7e221eeb2c.png" alt="Taxi in the mobile"><br><br>  The absence of fixed tariffs gives freedom of action, you yourself set the price for the trip depending on the level of "coolness" of the car or the circumstances, and of course the trip itself.  The choice of tactics is yours - most often the most economical option will be chosen, you can make low prices and carry out many bids.  And you can make the price ‚Äúhigher than the market price‚Äù, although there will be fewer bids then, but the profits from each will be higher.  And the clientele will be more decent and cultured. <br><br>  For example, at the time of open testing, the price of travel in ordinary taxis was 40-50 p.  in the district, as in our taxi, but customers drove for 60 rubles with drivers who indicated such a cost. <br><br>  Next, the problem was solved, how to inform the client if force majeure occurred.  Anything can happen - a wheel has struck, a blind-tube, and so on.  In this case, the driver clicks <i>"Force Majeure"</i> , the client in this case is immediately given the opportunity to choose another car, and the driver is not charged off the application.  True, the button has a limit of 1 time per day. <br><br>  If the driver successfully reached the place, he presses <i>"I arrived"</i> and expects the client.  In any taxi there are ‚Äúleft customers‚Äù and these are blacklisted.  Also implemented with us.  If the application is left, the driver clicks <i>"The client did not appear,"</i> and the application is not charged from the driver.  There is also a limit on this function - 2 times a day so that drivers do not abuse this privilege. <br><br>  <i><b>The client, after a couple of such calls, is blacklisted.</b></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8df/cad/9e3/8dfcad9e3b7740a772610cbf90619d4c.png" alt="Taxi in the mobile"><br><br>  <b>As a result, we can say that such a system gives the driver:</b> <br><ul><li>  Fair earnings. </li><li>  Freedom to choose applications. </li><li>  Freedom of pricing. </li><li>  Comfortable work without controllers and walkie-talkies. </li><li>  The ability to use the service as an add.  earnings  (No one forces you to work every day) </li></ul><br>  There are other interesting features, such as attracting customers and other drivers who have not yet used this service.  For this, the one who attracted new customers and drivers receives a percentage of each application, but I will tell you about this in the third part of our review. <br><br>  See you!  "Not a nail to you, not a rod!" <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/88693/">Taxi in mobile or Automation of popular business (part 1)</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/taxolet/blog/92413/">Taxi in the mobile - our success is the success of our partners.</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/taxolet/blog/92413/">(part 3)</a> </li></ul><br><br>  PS Topic posted at the request of the author of the project. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/89217/">https://habr.com/ru/post/89217/</a></p>
