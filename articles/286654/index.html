      Quotations have long been dismantled and interviews with Steve Jobs, and his presentations, and even his manner of dressing - recall the leader Xiaomi, whom the press dubbed "Chinese Jobs", not least because of a set of jeans and a black T-shirt.  The admiration of the founder of Apple, which after his death naturally took the form of a cult, sometimes makes it difficult to consider the stages of formation of a giant corporation and to make out in detail the history of Apple on the components of success. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  However, such an analysis is a subject of long-term studies, in the same material it is proposed to pay attention only to one detail with which everyone on the planet seems to be familiar, regardless of Apple‚Äôs adoration or hatred. <br><br>  Apple logo is an apple. <br><br>  Turn to the story.  An apple is a symbol that has appeared in the history of mankind on different continents and at different times.  It all started with an apple that Eve fed her husband.  Then an apple with the inscription "Beautiful" caused the Trojan War.  There was another apple that fell on Newton‚Äôs head (this moment, by the way, formed the basis of the very first Apple logo), and up to Einstein's theories of relativity, the world obeyed the laws discovered by the fruit. <br><br>  Apple wicked queens poisoned Snow White and Sleeping princesses, whole generations extended their lives with youthful apples, parents still feed children with apple sauce, yes, however, we also have apples very useful, especially if the body lacks iron.  New York - Big Apple, the recording studio of the Liverpool Four - Apple Records, cigarettes made up by Tarantino as opposed to product placement trends - Red Apple. <br><br>  Yes, Steve Jobs impeccably accurately selected the symbol and the name of his company.  But that is why today the apple is already outdated.  And if Steve Jobs reincarnated in the world (the great man was a Buddhist), she - or he - would already treat the apple as a waste material.  All the juice is squeezed out of it, the apple brand has reached its peak of maturity, but all the changes start from the inside, and under the beautiful skin they are not visible yet. <br><br>  Is it possible to find a replacement for such a juicy symbol, an ancient one as much as a trendy one? <br>  You can - tell us the ancient Egyptian frescoes, masons and Tolkien. <br><br>  Why not an eye? <br><br>  Eyes lead us along the road of life, helping to know the surrounding reality and becoming the mirror of our soul.  Half of us love the eyes.  We completely rely on the fidelity of the images that the eye represents to us, and which battle breaks out, if other people suddenly begin to see is not the same as we do.  Admit it, you argued with hoarseness in your voice that the dress is blue-black / white-gold? <br>  Anecdotes about the eye in abundance.  For example, they say that Kutuzov did not have an eye.  Not true - he had an eye. <br><br>  The eye has already been adopted by LG, Nvidia and CBS, in a schematic form it is ‚Äúreadable‚Äù in the Intel and Samsung logos, and in the form of the radiant Masonic Lodge delta winks at us from the world's most famous banknote - the US dollar. <br><br>  Who knows, perhaps the reincarnation of Steve Jobs today would call the company Eye.  EyePhone - what an elegant combination of innovation with continuity. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/286654/">https://habr.com/ru/post/286654/</a></p>
