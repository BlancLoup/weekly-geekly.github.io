They have a whole test bench at work from different models that are used to test applications.  To my bewildered "yes, who needs this" smart tivi "when you can safely connect a computer or smartphone to the TV," he said - come, you will see everything, and then you will ask who needs it.  It was foolish to refuse such an offer.  Especially when they promise to tell you how it works, what it works on and how to write programs for it.  All interested in the capabilities of modern TVs - please under the cat.  ;) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8fa/7d6/df3/8fa7d6df3f88eb48491f01b8e0045350.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Let's start with the lyrics and logic.  I think all habrayusers have computers, and the majority (99% of the read) of users prefer to receive all possible news from a fairly independent Internet, and not from the state-monopolized television and radio broadcast.  And if you want to watch movies on a large diagonal at home, play modern games on a PC or console, sitting in a chair or on the couch, then a high-quality LCD panel (or a plasma in the whole wall) will gladly come to your rescue ... and idle the remaining time if you are not a fan of television as such.  Fortunately, for several years now, some models have ceased to be just video signal receivers.  Many manufacturers have ‚ÄúSmart‚Äù TVs that can connect to the Internet, receive all sorts of content from it, work with special services and social networks.

      <br>
      There were a lot of TV sets, but there were 4 ‚Äúconnected‚Äù - Samsung, Phillips, Sony and LG. <br>  The first thing I began to meet (and what I remembered the most, respectively, and wrote the most) was a TV from LG. <br><br><h4>  LG Smart TV </h4><br>  The Smart TV application was tested on an LG LCD TV, along with an unusual Magic motion remote control, and, in fact, the remote control - 50% of the ‚Äúpleasure‚Äù.  In spite of the rather unusual form, not similar to anything related to television topics and in general, it is quite convenient to use this thing.  Most of all, it reminds the controller of the PlayStation game console: it has a built-in gyroscope and an acceleration sensor. <br>  Five, maximum seven minutes - and you get used to it, the cursor on the screen - the continuation of your hand (and your thoughts).  You can use it without thinking at all; you are not ‚Äúwatching‚Äù how to move the mouse cursor.  You just do it.  Same here.  The first thirty seconds you catch "moment" and "angle of rotation" (movement should be done with the whole forearm, and not with the brush).  A couple of minutes is needed for addiction and some ‚Äúcalibration‚Äù of the hand and brain.  After half an hour, you forget that you have something new and unusual in your hands, the brain, the hand, the remote and the cursor become one. <br>  Maybe reading this is a bit strange (listening and watching, I confess, too), but it all goes away as soon as you can get to know the remote control in person.  Well, you can do this in any M-Video, MediaMarkt or some Eldorado where there are showrooms.  The console, of course, does not play the main role in this review-comparison, but very significant in terms of convenience of interaction with the system (especially from a distance of several meters). <br><br>  Let's go back to the very Smart TV.  The appearance of the "smart shell" is quite simple and at the same time functional, there is some correlation with the Android-shell LG-smartphones of the current generation Optimus UI.  This is how the 2011 Smart TV looked like: <br><br><img src="http://hi-tech.imgsmail.ru/hitech_img/source/59456.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And this is how it looks now: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f45/826/50e/f4582650e3cfdeffe0037ed53c7f4842.jpg"><br><br>  As you can see, a new-fashioned ‚Äútiled‚Äù content presentation system has appeared, with previews, animation, and other Blackjack.  Top-left is the current television program, under it is a small block with affiliate advertising (supplied by the manufacturer itself ‚Äî that is, LG in this case).  Behind him are the ‚Äúblocks‚Äù of content: premium, 3D World, SmartWorld, SmartShare.  At the bottom of the screen - the menu "my applications". <br>  Looking ahead, I want to say that "premium" is a strange designation for this category.  Here there is not so much ‚Äúpaid‚Äù content, how many applications are the premium partners of the TV manufacturer.  The menu itself is perfectly animated and works without the slightest brakes.  "OS", as I was told, is based on Linux, but not Android.  Inside, everything works on the basis of the quad-core "Tegra" of the latter, at the time of the release of this TV, the third generation.  I did not find the rest of the information, but forgot to ask.  The current firmware perfectly supports Flash 10th version, the 11th is currently diligently and intensely ‚Äúsawing‚Äù (insider info), so you shouldn‚Äôt consider an outdated flash as a strong flaw - it will be fixed in a month or two. <br>  Let's go back to the structure.  Premium applications are laid out with special tiles (it, in turn, sends greetings to Sobyanin - here, unlike in Moscow, everything is clear, smooth and smooth): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/826/1ef/789/8261ef789d8e7c506c276680e1bc6dd8.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e01/b39/79a/e01b3979a436178adc85ac1478dbe61c.jpg"><br><br>  and presented as well-known channels and Internet portals involved in broadcasting video and music on demand.  In addition, Yandex services, Skype, YouTube, perhaps, the list has expanded (or has already expanded during the post writing, all of a sudden the new firmware came out) in the "premium" segment. <br><br><h5>  Browser </h5><br>  The browser is perhaps the main feature that users (and not only users) of past generations of ‚Äúsmarts‚Äù criticize, they say, why do I need a browser on TV?  Do not know how to do normally - do not do at all.  There is a communicator, tablet or smartphone, there is a computer and a laptop.  Well, on TV, why the browser?  Perhaps this view was formed in the era of the first generation of SmartTV, and maybe fueled by those who did not use anything like it. <br>  In the LG browser - one of the strengths of the smart functionality, especially against competitors.  None of the tested sites didn‚Äôt go on the layout and there were no problems with displaying the content.  Here is the interface: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/984/110/51e/98411051e702cbad3e45bfa51e88f0c9.jpg"><br><br>  The top panel contains back-forward buttons, an address bar, a bookmark button, a history button, a search window (search engines from Google, Yandex and Mail.ru are available), full-screen mode, zooming and settings.  There are tabs headings under the panel (and the ‚Äúclose current tab‚Äù button is on the right), but I didn‚Äôt find the ‚Äúcreate tab‚Äù button.  She is acutely lacking, I hope, she will sing it in the near future, I shouldn‚Äôt have paid attention to this alone. <br>  And here is our favorite habr on the big diagonal: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1fd/831/611/1fd831611f118c0a7c4a404101c92174.jpg"><br><br>  Pay attention to the keyboard: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/895/7e6/cae/8957e6cae256697126b50478d70e68e3.jpg"><br><br>  Normal layout with all popular extra characters.  In the presence of arrows for precise character-by-character navigation.  Typing with remote control is easy and convenient.  We'll return to the keyboard separately when it comes to the "obscured" Samsung.  :) <br>  Here are some more pictures with a browser: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/78d/3e8/66b/78d3e866b056f3f1eea5701c58a68088.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/78d/3e8/66b/78d3e866b056f3f1eea5701c58a68088.jpg"><br><br><h5>  SmartWorld applications </h5><br>  The next menu item are applications.  The TV initially pre-installed the main applications and demo versions of toys (three-dimensional, by the way, built on the popular Unity engine), but the creators did not bypass the possibility of expanding the functionality.  In it there is a kind of "Epp Store" or "Market", which presents the works of third-party developers.  Here is the photo shop: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/191/826/cfc/191826cfc33fde12ebee8156c6bd8a98.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/41c/707/14f/41c70714f336a3a31587ff7ab00be91d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/582/4fa/2da/5824fa2dad1ebcc574af04b2d313c1e1.jpg"><br><br>  The choice is wide enough, ranging from simple toys such as Tetris, ending rather quickly addictive, albeit simple games like bowling.  I am preparing a separate article about SmartWorld applications and development of applications for LG Smart TV, so you can simply know that they exist and the store has pre-moderation - dull ‚Äúhell-hearts‚Äù and there are no missed curves. <br><br><h5>  SmartShare functionality </h5><br>  Perhaps another feature that is not popular in this country.  Many simply do not notice it, but which is already in many smartphones - SmartShare.  You can broadcast video, audio and photos directly from your smartphone to a TV set; it‚Äôs enough to be in the same Wi-Fi network with the ‚Äúbox‚Äù.  Either the TV is connected via cable to the same router as the telephone.  Well, or when you connect Wi-Fi Direct, if your device supports it.  There are many ways of interaction, everything works fine.  It may take some time for the TV to scan available content on the smartphone, but in general it is much faster and more convenient than transferring pictures to a USB flash drive, turning on a computer / laptop, connecting to a TV / plugging in a USB flash drive.  Everything can be done without getting up from the couch. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5a2/be6/9e3/5a2be69e33e6ce89571d65400a6db8ce.jpg"><br><br><h5>  3D World </h5><br>  3D World is a catalog of three-dimensional content available for your TV model.  Here you can buy movies (or watch their three-dimensional trailers).  The 3D function in LG TVs, in my opinion, is implemented much better than that of many competitors.  Despite its simplicity and ‚Äúprimitiveness‚Äù from a technical point of view, the implementation allows the four of us to sit in front of the TV (!) And watch the movie in 3D without any problems.  Glasses do not require batteries, and the three-dimensional effect is quite realistic and does not look plastic and "toy." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d63/1dd/cac/d631ddcace2f08147f58d5c93db1d8b5.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ad9/532/fa1/ad9532fa1cec530dd4f2c071c8d06a38.jpg"><br><br>  Settings <br>  The TV settings are a separate topic, not much related to Smart TV, but all models of ‚ÄúSmart TVs‚Äù contain a number of settings to ensure ‚Äúsmart functionality‚Äù.  For example, this is how network connection setup looks like: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/807/875/08d/80787508dc1949e505a8a2eb5a35851c.jpg"><br><br>  But the appearance of the homescreen setting: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b78/22d/24b/b7822d24b59247252d4a8646314d877f.jpg"><br><br>  As you can see, no one forbids you to create your own blocks with frequently used applications and put them on a separate desktop, and not to look for your favorite applications in the strip below: <br>  Games <br>  Games, for the most part, paid.  There are several demo versions preinstalled on the TV, the graphics are ‚Äúsmartphone‚Äù, are we waiting for ports of all kinds of nidalspids with tegra-zone?  :) <br>  Here are photos from a pair of toys: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b21/3d5/6d0/b213d56d04a3e337bc4ee684327d25d0.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ba3/ac4/c31/ba3ac4c3112c58ee66de2d1545be8268.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/217/5b8/8f0/2175b88f0294947ce84122e47faa898f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/69d/f2e/093/69df2e0932a67390f1d206d48d4c7485.jpg"><br><br>  For serious igrunov there are consoles, but to have fun, take children or just pass the time with friends / acquaintances, without launching anything hardcore - this can be shifted to the TV.  Management in most games, sharpened for new models - with the expectation of using a PS-Move-like remote.  We will return to the management of the games when the turn reaches the main competitor - Samsung. <br>  Sociality is represented by the ability to connect a twitter or a facebook account, secretly told me that the developers promised to add another social network in the near future, this time ours, the Russian one.  What kind of network they didn‚Äôt say, but I don‚Äôt think that this is Contact, although I don‚Äôt exclude the possibility of its occurrence. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/951/bb2/730/951bb27307aeeefa37a8544c1cf70be7.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6e5/743/3ca/6e57433cab3054b8022262e29027e485.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Sony and Phillips </h4><br>  Smart TV from brands such as Sony and Phillips were presented last year's models, so I did not particularly consider them.  Or rather, viewed, but not photographed.  You can look at the 12-year models on the network, the differences are minimal, inquiries in Google easily find reviews of current versions of these manufacturers' smart phones, development over the year isn‚Äôt what is missing, it is there, but it‚Äôs minimal against the background of two Korean concerns. <br>  Sony came up with her proprietary PS-style interface: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/766/e10/8a6/766e108a644ef7acf1878d679d44c06c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dec/28c/4d1/dec28c4d1bb91efb809704cfabde45a4.jpg"><br><br>  Fans of "curling" love him, he seems overloaded, uncomfortable and ugly to me.  Place him in 2007, five years have passed, it's time to move forward. <br>  In Philips In terms of "beauty" a little more sad, here is the menu: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9ce/9e5/a14/9ce9e5a14bf0564ff5a0caea849f014f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7b4/712/aa4/7b4712aa41c8de84d71bee094a85accd.jpg"><br><br>  Of the benefits - everything is simple and clear, even though I did not see the support of the Great Mighty in the main menu.  Navigation through the menu is available from a simple remote and does not cause difficulties. <br>  Speaking of consoles.  Sony comes bundled with this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6b8/dbb/1c0/6b8dbb1c0752302f777914589c374849.jpg"><br><br>  I do not know who invented "arming" the TV with this cudgel, who designed it and why you can get lost on it.  Tell me, which button turns on Smart TV?  This thing weighs, by the way, decently, here is its photo next to other consoles: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ae0/25b/624/ae025b624092e3f7780fd7ae67b50c9e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/227/5f5/f1e/2275f5f1e2087a1a6865c566268fd2ac.jpg"><br><br>  Due to the large backwardness of these Smart-TV solutions, even from last year‚Äôs Samsung and LG counterparts, I don‚Äôt want to go deep into the details of the ‚Äúsmart‚Äù data.  I can only say that annex IVI looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/538/f1e/82a/538f1e82ae8d23e4363cd5a78eb01c68.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Samsung </h4><br>  The main competitor in smart TV is another South Korean organization that manufactures from bulldozers to ... the devil knows what they do NOT produce. <br>  This is how the main menu of Samsung looks very beautiful: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/718/d1e/1e7/718d1e1e7150a145863a8f1c48d78c8a.jpg"><br><br>  Everything is very cloudy, nice and nicely decorated.  Immediately got the message about updates, the platform is updated, and that's good.  Clicked "ok", the update is loaded in the background.  The structure of the main menu is slightly different from that in LG, but in general the trends are the same: tile from applications and grouped services from above.  TV offered to set the date and time.  Commendable initiative: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e81/cde/350/e81cde3500b797c28eb75b5faee17c64.jpg"><br><br>  This model comes with a magnificent metal remote control with touch (a la touchpad on notebooks) controls: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5fd/fcf/f24/5fdfcff24216773398370cd0f166ba75.jpg"><br><br>  The Smart TV (Smart Hub) button can be safely taken for a logo, but this is a button and it is pressed.  The console is very solid and beautiful.  Unfortunately, I would like it to be also usable, but this, apparently, will have to ask ‚ÄúSanta Claus‚Äù, or whoever they have there, in Korea, for the new year lays out gifts under the palm tree.  I had to suffer a little with the remote control: every time I put it off for a minute or two ... (to compensate for its elegance with the usual push-button device of the classic layout), I tried ... correctly, to ‚Äúmove‚Äù the cursor with an accelerometer, having become accustomed to such an elegant solution from LG.  The touch remote after the ‚Äúvirtual pointer‚Äù - a complete disappointment - the cursor tupit and does not go where it should, then goes too far.  And yet, they say that this is the most gluttonous remote in terms of batteries.  Maybe he (remote) on Android 2.1?  ) <br><br>  What does the person who saw in the official advertisement of SmartTV see that ‚Äúbirds‚Äù were specially altered for him?  :) Acquaintance with Samsung began with an attempt to play AngryBirds.  Why precisely with ‚Äúattempts‚Äù?  The birds here are not simple, the control ‚Äúa la Kinekt‚Äù is implemented, through the camera of this TV.  If someone from the first time will be able to slay Ptah in the first level more than one star - write in a personal, ok?  Recognition of the hand TV produces only in very refined conditions, hands quickly get tired of holding on weight in an unnatural position, and if the TV loses the palm, then another five seconds will look for it while you shake it in front of the camera.  I think if you attach a pair of sporting weight bracelets to your wrist, you can burn calories well, destroying pigs and their construction.  Or coming into a rage every time the sensor has lost its palm, and the last bird has gone ‚Äúinto the milk‚Äù.  Unfortunately, the control of birds by the camera still needs some work.  It would be better to make a "kinetic" scroll <br>  The second place where I got into the TV was the browser.  Here is the start screen: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/307/1f8/914/3071f8914278179a6ed3748f3cde91bd.jpg"><br><br>  The search system from Bing, at the bottom - strange tips on the buttons, apparently, for the classic console (at the moment I was still tormented with the touch, periodically waving them like LG's). <br>  The Samsung TV bonus is the support of the 11th flash and a slightly more powerful hardware stuff, if on LG Smart TV I went to z-music.org without any problems and started listening to music (though in a few minutes the music ended up with problems with flash) ), here ... the keyboard has opened: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/44a/2c6/e0a/44a2c6e0abd1420ab537c6eb7f1418de.jpg"><br><br>  Who will find the hyphen? <br>  Ok, we try to switch to the 3x4 keyboard.  With the touch panel, alternative symbols are not selected, we take the usual ones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/982/b0c/b09/982b0cb098db94ccf2fd2f7e33024dc5.jpg"><br><br>  7 and a half minutes of torment, and here it is, the z-music site: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7f2/2a9/eec/7f22a9eec854ce51f8d1b7b3d6464f83.jpg"><br><br>  Music plays, tracks are switched.  That's just to spend seven minutes entering the site with a hyphen in the title ... somehow not fun.  They say that you can somehow connect the smartphone and manage it directly.  Unfortunately, Samsung AllShare didn‚Äôt want to see either the LG 4X HD comrade, my hot-haired Galaxy S II, or any other device found in the office of those who were not very busy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6e1/85f/0c7/6e185f0c79db3f441838d75c75ed6a63.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/229/d01/72e/229d0172e3e442060d4aa887ac1b7b4f.jpg"><br><br>  Periodically, when you try to run anything from the firmware, the following window is displayed: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9ab/905/887/9ab905887e0c2936695c8308f5ed4850.jpg"><br><br>  That is, he did not want to continue working without registration.  New account to create a TV just refused, despite the fact that I recently downloaded updates from the network.  Completely frustrated.  Updates, by the way, swayed, apparently, from somewhere in the suburbs of Cambodia.  Nothing else to explain the 20-minute download of 10 megabytes (with a 720p video without a minute ago) I can not. <br>  But the Ivi app looks exactly the same as the Philips 2011. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/648/192/a94/648192a94ce611b2b79732d007f9b628.jpg"><br><br>  But Ivi on LG: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/647/497/bb8/647497bb8418e877f0e1c43ac77832e6.jpg"><br><br>  Notice the menu item "music" below? <br>  It opens the built-in Ivi music app.  None of the competitors had cross-control applications detected.  Here is such a nice bonus. <br>  The settings of the TV itself are, in principle, fairly standard.  Is that the design of the "dark" and the menu order is not the same as that of LG.  There is nothing to learn here. <br><br><h5>  3D mode. </h5><br>  Gallery of three-dimensional content: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1d2/1c2/4c3/1d21c24c35ef339cd06f502280971fcd.jpg"><br><br>  The 3D itself is ‚Äúactive‚Äù, the shutter glasses are used, while watching 3D on the Samsung screen, it is held up to four, if at least one more screen appears in sight, flickering is noticeable, the eyes get tired quickly.  With glasses from LG, there is no such problem, it is quite possible in them to simultaneously look at the smartphone or the screen of another TV. <br>  There are fewer applications in the Samsung store, and they are inferior in quality to LG counterparts, and, for the most part, in terms of the interface.  In general, in many places, Samsung's television interface is inferior to similar solutions in LG, both in its accuracy of rendering and convenience in general.  Here's what the planning of the transfer recording looks like (in your absence or watching another movie, for example) with Samsung: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ae2/208/afc/ae2208afc99ad658c2f54f013035fc4c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c5d/73d/01e/c5d73d01e2160517215f0976bafdcb47.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/936/6f4/cac/9366f4cac3342680e076d2c90ce42782.jpg"><br><br>  But as they see the solution to this problem in LG: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/884/964/4fc/8849644fcaadaa6ed39731febc732613.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/34b/d11/a24/34bd11a246dbdee97696cb80098a2456.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Instead of conclusion </h4><br>  These are the Smart TV systems now on the market.  The main players are LG and Samsung, the first ones have everything with design, usability and control, while the second ones seem to have more powerful hardware.  I would not even look at Phillips, Sonya and other Panasonic in the store after seeing this pitch pi ... pi ... horror.  It seems like the producers are going to some coalition and want to use common developments for the unification of applications, but I did not go into details yet, but I wouldn‚Äôt rely on what I was told without proofs.  I hope, the basis will be software from LG, as the most "finished" and neat at the moment.  I wish Samsung to hire a normal UI and UX specialist, on Android phones they are moving in the right direction, but on TVs everything is so sad from the point of view of usability. <br>  And finally, in fact, the opinion of Smart TV as an established phenomenon.  This feature is a great way to get info without getting up from the couch, not plunging into the web with your head, and just a convenient bonus.  Agree that the presence of features is not its absence.  Well, if in your latitudes also good programs are shown on TV - then why not actually be able to interact more with the TV?  In Russia, so far, not masthev, but promising and interesting. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/153159/">https://habr.com/ru/post/153159/</a></p>
