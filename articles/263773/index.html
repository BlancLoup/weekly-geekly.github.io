In this article we will share our experience in implementing and launching such a service in Russia. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-grad/blog/263773/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e53/444/031/e53444031c9d4a6a8f8df34d6660d7a0.jpg"></a> <a name="habracut"></a>  <i>/ Photo by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/dskley/">Dennis Skley</a> <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/">CC</a></i> <br><br><h2>  What is this about </h2><br>  Leading global analytics companies identify ServiceNow as one of the leading ITSM solutions.  Its essence lies in the automation of everything related to <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITSM">the IT service management system</a> .

      The best way to use this solution is to obtain it using the SaaS (Software as a Service) model, which saves the client from the need to invest in his own infrastructure, enables remote work and quick configuration. <br><br>  This solution boasts the most complete coverage of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITIL">ITIL</a> processes - the library of information technology infrastructure.  In addition, it has the ability to integrate with other systems and user-friendly graphical interface. <br><br><h2>  Where does it work </h2><br>  ServiceNow has proven itself at a very high level.  For example, it was used for the IT infrastructure serving the preparation and holding of the Olympic Games in Sochi. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúServiceNow cloud service since its launch, several years before the start of the Olympic Games, was the main tool for managing all ITSM processes of the Sochi 2014 Organizing Committee. <br><br>  The service covered such processes as Incident management, Problem management, Change management.  On the basis of the service, the concept of a ‚Äúsingle window‚Äù was organized, when all users contacted a single phone number or email address to solve any problems or issues related to the operation of the Games services. <br><br>  Using a user-friendly interface, all applications were distributed and processed on the basis of predefined policies and procedures.  Depending on the types and categories of applications, different processing rules were applied to them, as specified in the Service Level Agreements (SLA). <br><br>  The presence of a well-developed and well-documented software interface (API) for ServiceNow made it possible to integrate the service into the existing IT infrastructure and information systems of the Organizing Committee ‚Äù, <br><br>  - Alexander Adadurov, chief expert of the management of the operation of the applied information systems of the Sochi 2014 Organizing Committee </blockquote><br>  At this, the history of cooperation, which began in Sochi, did not stop, but rather the opposite - it captured new areas.  For example, the <a href="http://www.it-guild.com/">IT Guild has</a> implemented this solution for the <a href="http://sochiautodrom.ru/">Sochi Autodrome</a> , which is located in the Olympic Park. <br><br>  Now the ServiceNow platform services the conduct of the Russian stage of the Formula 1 Grand Prix at the level of the main operational center of the Sochi Autodrome.  The platform allowed to automate most of all processes.  For example, the formation of applications using e-mail and self-service portal Employee Self Service (ESS). <br><br>  In addition, with the help of ServiceNow, all incidents during racing runs are managed.  Register and monitor all events from real accidents to service signals from the staff.  Such an approach made it possible to abandon the ‚Äúpaper‚Äù component and record events automatically. <br><br><blockquote>  We provide a complete ‚Äúout-of-the-box product‚Äù that solves tasks not only in IT, but also in other sectors, including the financial, legal sector, human resources, marketing, services and other areas. <br><br>  Compared to 2013, the company's profitability in 2014 increased by 61 percent, and the customer base exceeded the threshold of more than 3,000 customers, among whom are Russian companies <br><br>  - Peter Hellner, Director of Business Development in Russia and the CIS at ServiceNow </blockquote><br><h2>  ServiceNow in Russia </h2><br>  The popularity of ServiceNow and legislative innovations in the framework of 152- ‚ÄúAbout personal data‚Äù formed a request to transfer the cloud-based ServiceNow system to us in Russia.  We decided to address this issue and entered into a partnership agreement for MSP (Managed Service Provider) with ServiceNow. <br><br>  Such an agreement gives us the right to provide services using ServiceNow products using our own cloud located in the data center in the Russian Federation. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúServiceNow, from our point of view, is the best solution for automating ITIL processes on the market, as evidenced by its rapid growth abroad.  Many international, as well as some Russian companies, being on the territory of Russia, use ServiceNow from the ‚Äúforeign cloud‚Äù. <br><br>  Within the framework of the existing requirements of the legislation (152- ‚ÄúAbout personal data‚Äù) there is a need to transfer this system to Russia.  IT-GRAD, under the MSP agreement established with ServiceNow, offers a new service for using ServiceNow solutions based on its own data centers in the Russian Federation, which solves the problem of storing personal data in Russia. <br><br>  I think the inclusion in the portfolio of SaaS solutions offered by IT-GRAD company of such a wonderful product as ServiceNow will be enthusiastically received on the Russian market ‚Äù <br><br>  - Dmitry Gachko, General Director, IT-GRAD </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/263773/">https://habr.com/ru/post/263773/</a></p>
