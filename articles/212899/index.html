Some time ago I worked as a freelancer, now I work in a small studio.  We do not have a project manager, therefore, often, I myself act as this very manager, part-time.  I have a rather large experience in dealing with various customers.  The article ‚Äú <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/212499/">Brief instructions for working with a web-designer (for a project manager)</a> ‚Äù caused a flurry of emotions and a storm of indignation in me, because I always tried to avoid such customers.  In this article I will try to describe how, ideally, the work of the customer and designer should be done. <br><br>  I am pleased to accept criticism and listen to the opinions of the ‚Äúother side‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  Who is a web designer </h4><br>  One of the main mistakes of our clients is that they really do not realize who this web designer really is and what he should be able to do in the end.  All problems and disagreements begin with it. <br><br>  Most people think that a web designer is a graphic artist who designs on the basis of his own taste, and his main task is to decorate the site and come up with fun fentifeshlyushki and uzorchiki. <br><br>  This is fundamentally wrong. <br><br>  A web designer is, first of all, an architect, whose direct duties include the study of user behavior and the design of competent, convenient and working interfaces based on this data.  This designer should think about what elements, what information and in what order should be placed on the site.  The location of the blocks, controls, color scheme, visual accents on the site - all this is not taken from the ceiling.  Every detail on the site is located in accordance with certain principles, and it is the web designer who must be able to justify them.  This is his main job, please, dear customers, do not take it on yourself. <br><br><h4>  What information should be provided to the performer </h4><br>  In order for a designer to design a truly competent interface, he must know the answer to two questions: what do you, as the site owner, want to get from this site and what your customers want? <br><br>  We, the designers, it is very important to know your target audience.  Often, it‚Äôs best to describe Central Asia not from top management, but from simple specialists: sales managers and receptionists.  After all, most often your clients communicate with these specialists, it is worth to listen to their opinion. <br><br>  We need to know what goals and objectives you set for the site.  Very often, instead, we hear about the personal preferences of the customer in terms of visual design, which ultimately do not allow making the site a full-fledged tool for achieving certain results.  Sites do not sell, do not bring new customers, they just hang on the Internet.  Set clear objectives, specific goals, share plans for the development of the project, so that we can take into account all the nuances. <br><br><h4>  Brief and technical task </h4><br>  The first thing we do with my customers is to fill out the brief.  Each designer has his own brief and this is an important document.  The brief describes your ideas, goals and objectives of the project, plans for the development of the project, the target audience, your tastes and wishes (believe, we always try to take them into account if they do not harm the final result), the ideology of your enterprise and its mission and so on.  In general, everything that can help the designer to reach the goal is written to this document.  It is best to fill the brief together: one head is good, and two is better.  When filling together, some ideas may immediately appear or, conversely, something superfluous will be cut off.  In addition, it saves time. <br><br>  Next, the designer analyzes the brief and draws up the technical task.  Ideally, the TK is a designer, which is adjusted by the customer and, necessarily, is approved.  The technical task prescribes what will be implemented on the site and what: what elements, tools, blocks and information will be used.  TK is a clear instruction for the designer.  Competent TK can be transferred to the coder and programmer (if they work separately from the designer), which ultimately saves you time.  Terms of Reference - the basis of your future project, do not treat its drafting frivolously. <br><br>  It may seem that there are too many formalities, but in fact, the brief and TK save you time, nerves and other resources. <br><br><h4>  Prototype is important </h4><br>  After approval of the technical specifications, the designer develops a prototype.  This is the framework of the site, which shows which elements will be located where, how the user will work with them, and how these elements will interact with each other.  This is the main work of the designer, it can take a long time, it is in the prototype that all the basics of your site‚Äôs work are laid. <br>  Why you should not immediately do the "final" version with all the design elements in all its glory: <br><ol><li>  The prototype can be recycled many times.  And if the frame is easy to remake, then the ready-made layout with all styles is more difficult and much longer to remake. </li><li>  The prototype is usually made in black and white, with minimal detail.  This is also done in order for the customer to evaluate the usability, not visual effects, when analyzing the frame. </li></ol><br><br>  It is very good if the prototype is interactive and it clearly shows what will happen when performing a particular action.  I start to style any page only after the approval of the prototype and this prototype does not change.  This is done so that at the most inopportune moment there would be no comments like: "And let's insert a banner here." <br><br><h4>  Stylization </h4><br>  After the site framework is ready and approved, the designer proceeds to stylize the prototype and turns it into a ready-made layout.  Here we focus on the wishes of the customer: colors, style, etc.  and try to make it so that the site would like not only users, but also customers.  In order for this stage of interaction to pass smoothly and comfortably, remember and do the following: <br><ol><li>  As much as possible, state your wishes to the designer, provide a brand book (logo, advertising and printed materials, in general, everything that helps identify you or your company), tell us what style your company follows (business, informal, youth, etc.), show design of which sites you like, etc. </li><li>  The design has its own rules and laws, and designers try to follow them, listen to the opinion of a professional. </li></ol><br><br><h4>  Editing </h4><br>  Making changes to the layout is a standard procedure that is rarely avoided.  Do not be afraid to express your opinion, try to clearly, briefly but clearly state your suggestions.  Try to talk about all your comments "in one go," that would not stretch the process of making changes for a long time.  Remember, if the designer believes and, most importantly, can justify why you should not make these or other changes, please listen to his opinion. <br><br>  My customers usually print a mock-up or prototype, paint their wishes and send the sheet to me (personally or by email). <br><br><h4>  Additional pages and files </h4><br>  I always do the so-called ‚Äúextra pages‚Äù and advise you to require them from the designer.  This is a page with typography (text, lists, tables, quotes, headers, images) and a page with user interface elements (buttons, links, menu items, drop-down lists, forms, checkboxes, radio buttons, icons, etc.) .  All elements of the user interface should be shown in several states (normal, active, inactive, when hovering) and decorated in a separate file for the layout designer with clear explanations.  This is necessary in order that the coder could completely "prescribe" the style of your site.  For example, if your budget is limited and you do not order the development of a user's personal account, but use standard pages, they, at least, will not be stylistically different from the whole site. <br><br>  In source files, layers and groups must be signed and color coded.  The fonts and originals of the images must be attached (for example, the background image: the designer has a cropped layout, but the designer needs an original). <br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br><ol><li>  Listen to the opinion of a professional </li><li>  Respect the work and time of others </li><li>  Discuss key points in advance: timing, cost, end result, number of pages and elements being developed.  Approve them in writing or by e-mail (not in words) </li><li>  Contribute to the work of the designer, answer questions, provide information, go to the contact </li><li>  Treat people the way you want to be treated </li></ol></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/212899/">https://habr.com/ru/post/212899/</a></p>
