The task of such an architect is to adapt the software to the environment (in this case, to the desktop), to make it work for people.  As well as working with engineers on the feasibility of solutions.

      In GIMP, I lead the work on conceptual innovation in the interface.  This means the design (and redesign) of the interface, its description (see <a href="http://gui.gimp.org/">gui.gimp.org</a> ), as well as the resolution of many nuances (from small to medium) in usability that occur non-systematically. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <strong>What prompted you to work with the GIMP interface, because this work is not paid?</strong> <br><br>  My company designs various interesting things for software and mobile companies.  In the process, we solve very difficult problems.  True, I can not tell you anything about this, as it falls under the NDA. <br><blockquote>  Free software is a matter of freedom, not price.  To understand the essence, you have to think about freedom as freedom of speech, and not as free beer. "( <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">The Free Software Definition by FSF</a> , Eng.). </blockquote><br>  Working on GIMP gives me the opportunity to share with the whole world all the details of my architect‚Äôs work - how to approach a complex, large project and the process of creating innovative solutions in cooperation with the user. <br><br>  <strong>When you came to the project that you wanted to change in the first place.</strong>  <strong>Maybe something shocked or very surprised?</strong> <br><br>  At the time I joined GIMP, I didn‚Äôt use it at all (as did Photoshop).  Therefore, I did not have any personal interest in any points.  And this is perhaps the most sensible situation for an interface architect. <br><br>  Instead, I was really interested in integrating the GEGL engine, which automatically provided many innovations, such as lossless editing.  What was required innovative interface. <br><br>  <strong>In your <a href="http://www.mmiworks.net/eng/publications/blog.html">personal blog</a> , in March 2008, you promised to cover what will happen to the GIMP interface, but this was the last entry related to the interface redesign.</strong>  <strong>Nothing happens to the interface?</strong> <br><br>  It happened that for m + mi works, 2008 was very successful and very tense, which meant that I didn‚Äôt have much time to work with the rest of the GIMP UI team, and even more so for writing in a blog about the future of the GIMP interface. <br><br>  <strong>What is supposed to be done with the GIMP interface in the near future, if possible, with reference to versions?</strong> <br><br>  The first thing you can expect is the ‚Äútagging‚Äù of all resources (brushes, gradients, palettes).  This means that everyone will be able to organize and find resources in the way he likes it.  This is generally complete and is now being integrated into the next version.  I worked on this over the past year with Aurimas Juska. <br><br>  One of the reasons you can expect me to write a lot more on my blog about GIMP in 2009 is that some of the many fundamental changes that were planned in GIMP reach their critical mass.  And I want to show how they affect the UI. <br><br>  One of the fundamental changes, which apparently will happen sooner rather than later (at 2.10?), Is the introduction of a single-window mode, which will complement the current multi-window mode.  I will have to design it very soon ... <br><br>  <strong>What are your plans for the GIMP development team for the distant future?</strong> <br><br>  Long-term plans are mainly related to GEGL and the opportunities that are opening up for the introduction of new methods of work, instead of looking back at the terrible ‚Äúpatches‚Äù from the 90s and copying them. <br><br>  In addition, there are many other topics that you should pay attention to in order to realize the vision of GIMP as a product.  Such as typography.  Or solving serious UI flaws, for example, better integration of tool properties into a common work area. <br><br>  <strong>How will the interface be redesigned, will there be a smooth transition from version to version or will one day users get a completely new product design?</strong> <br><br>  Of course, changes will take place in steps, from version to version.  Sometimes the steps will be more, sometimes less.  The significance of these steps will vary. <br><br>  Don't forget that the GIMP development team is very small, by and large it is just a handful of people.  What technological changes will occur and will be available through the interface depends in fact on the enthusiasm of several people. <br><br>  <strong>How do developers relate to the <a href="http://gimp-brainstorm.blogspot.com/">GIMP UI brainstorm</a> project?</strong>  <strong>Ideas that people publish there, in any way help the project?</strong> <br><br>  UI brainstorm is an innovative method from a UI team.  It is not done by developers or developers.  The worst thing you can do for usability is to bring users and developers together and let them discuss what needs to be done.  The UI brainstorm is analyzed by my team in order to understand the needs of users and then work out more deeply the individual ideas received from users.  This applies to the entire interface design process. <br><br>  <strong>In my opinion, GIMP has great potential.</strong>  <strong>Do you think GIMP can compete with commercial products?</strong> <br><br>  All that GIMP has to do is meet the vision of the product, as the GIMP team identified it at the first conference I was with them in 2006.  I think we have a good chance to realize this vision.  This will make GIMP very effective and understandable to use for those people who fall into our target group. <br><br>  <strong>Most users customize the editor "for themselves."</strong>  <strong>Do developers think that users automatically, through GIMP, send user settings and error reports to the Internet to increase convenience and stability?</strong> <br><br>  I see 3 points in this issue - fine tuning, usability and stability.  And they are not related to each other. <br><br>  Fine tuning is purely personal.  What works for you will probably not work for millions.  GIMP is a product that must be made for millions of people, each of whom is unique.  I am the one who is obliged to take this into account. <br><br>  Usability is thought out by professionals in this field.  As I said earlier, sending user requests directly to developers leads to a negative impact on usability.  In addition to the UI brainstorm, there is a continuous discussion with Ellen Reitmayr on how to implement more innovative methods of work in GIMP. <br><br>  Stability depends on error messages and there is a bug tracker for this ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/51203/">https://habr.com/ru/post/51203/</a></p>
