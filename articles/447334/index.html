      I will not impose our position, this post is rather a response to requests to give an example of what the content strategy for one of our projects looks like. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At once I will say that we consider content to be a significant ranking factor, we like to place texts, we do not refuse the rest of the promotion (on the contrary, we work according to the ‚ÄúBalanced website indicators‚Äù model). <br><br><h2>  Briefly about the case </h2><br>  <b>Site type:</b> online store <br>  <b>Scope:</b> weapons, parts and accessories for him <br>  <b>Domain age:</b> 9 years <br>  <b>Key words:</b> 183 <br>  <b>Promotion Term</b> (period described in the case): 12 months <br><br><h2>  Specifics </h2><br>  When it comes to promoting an online store, a verdict-axiom immediately arrives: ‚ÄúInternet-shops are not promoted with texts, decides the type-in, links and behavioral‚Äù.  As already mentioned above, we are for the balance of indicators, taking into account the specifics of the project. <br><br>  The fact is that the weapons-related subject matter is rather complicated in itself.  Therefore, the target audience here is significantly different in terms of competence, but united by high involvement.  This distinguishes it, for example, from the audience of an online store of cell phone cases.  The second is important that is suitable for a specific model, the first are not always sure that it is suitable for their specific tasks. <br><br><h2>  Structure and Clustering </h2><br>  Promotion was required on requests that describe groups and types of products.  For example: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ie/_r/we/ie_rweo8erajbc2prdivjjihse8.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Query semantics implied that both product and category pages would be landing. <br><br>  Example of query clustering: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/so/up/sj/soupsje05bid5wje9xppqp8ghbk.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The catalog is built according to the standard tree structure, spare parts in it are expanded by type and compatibility with different models of weapons.  In the example we are talking about the section for spare parts for the hunting rifle MR-153. <br><br>  Please note that for requests like ‚Äúhandguard mr 153‚Äù a page of a specific product is selected, in this case from black plastic.  There are other options in the catalog: from different types of wood, with camouflage prints, etc. Page / 1984.html was ‚Äúlucky‚Äù to be promoted by this request because at the time of clustering it was already selected by the search engine and was searched by this request.  Oriented to Yandex. <br><br>  Immediately answer possible questions: <br><br><blockquote>  - <i>And if no version of the forearm was not a search?</i> <br>  - This happens, although infrequently (and with domains 9 years of age - very rarely).  For example, if the site is under development right now, and you already need to determine which pages will move.  In this case, we choose together with the customer either the most popular version of execution, or the cheapest one, or by some other criteria that he offers. </blockquote><blockquote>  - <i>And the rest of the goods of the same type, but a different model?</i>  <i>Will you also order SEO texts for them?</i> <br>  - For the rest we will not, if the search engine does not consider that you need to show another product.  This also almost does not happen, but if it happens, we will be forced to work on another page. </blockquote><blockquote>  - <i>And if the selected page disappears?</i> <br>  - It happens well, oh, very rarely, because we are negotiating with the customer.  Even if the product ends up in stock, the page still remains in place, just instead of the "Buy" button there will be another one.  But if this unlikely situation happens, then yes, we will put the 301st redirect and order a new text, re-understand the reference environment, etc. </blockquote><br><h2>  Types of texts </h2><br>  For online stores it is difficult to find such texts that look naturally on the pages of products and categories.  In our case, lucky: the subject itself allows you to think of a format that will be useful to one part of the audience and will not be perceived by the other part with hostility. <br><br><h3>  1. For categories </h3><br>  Short texts that would give information about the weapon itself and the possibilities of its modification.  On the one hand, it convinces the potential buyer that improvements or repairs according to the desired scheme are possible and make sense.  On the other - he learns about additional non-obvious possibilities. <br><br>  The format has to be read, and at the same time, it is excellent for the organic introduction of the necessary keywords and environment with additional words. <br>  Since each of these pages is dedicated to the repair and tuning of a specific weapon model, we get a text that is replete with related vocabulary: ‚Äúreplacement‚Äù, ‚Äúaccuracy of combat‚Äù, ‚Äúreliable grip‚Äù, ‚Äúbalanced‚Äù, ‚Äúcaliber‚Äù, ‚Äúscree shot‚Äù, ‚Äú rifling ‚Äù, etc. This is not only a convincing syllable for the user, but also natural text markers for a search engine. <br><br>  <b>What in TK:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  1-2 text requests </li><li>  Diluted entry, 1-2 times for each keyword </li><li>  Up to 1500 characters with no spaces </li><li>  Additional words </li><li>  Subheads </li><li>  At least 1 bulleted list </li></ul><br>  <b>Page location:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Short announcement section to the list of products </li><li>  The rest of the text after the list </li></ul><br><h3>  2. For product pages </h3><br>  It turned out to increase the allowable amount: there is a special tab on the card with detailed information: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5d/fy/4u/5dfy4uptfklmcjvcxwrnpvdi8eu.png" alt="image"><br><br>  By the way, there is also a ‚ÄúSee also‚Äù block, which allows you to quickly switch to another product if the user was looking for another design (it was not originally planned to place it above the text, insisted by the customer). <br><br>  The structure of the text is similar, with the difference that here we tell in more detail about a particular product, and not about a group of products.  That is, if the user enters the page with a plastic forearm, then he reads about a more reliable grip, less weight, well thought out ergonomic form. <br><br>  <b>What in TK:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  1-3 text queries </li><li>  Diluted entry, 1-3 times per request </li><li>  The volume depends on the number of keywords, ~ 500 characters per entry, total from 1500 to 3000 characters </li><li>  Additional words </li><li>  Subheads </li><li>  At least 1 bulleted list </li></ul><br>  <b>Layout on pages:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  In a special tab on the item card </li></ul><br><h3>  3. For the articles section </h3><br>  As part of the development of a common content component and internal linking, they ordered texts on an open topic and without given keywords.  The topic was determined by the page to which the article refers. <br><br>  <b>What in TK:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Link to the page of the catalog, which determines the subject </li><li>  The volume of 2000-2500 characters </li></ul><br>  <b>Page location:</b> <br>  The solid text on a separate page in the "Articles". <br><br><h3>  4. For third-party sites </h3><br>  Two material formats were ordered. <br><br>  <b>Question answer.</b>  For services like Mail.ru Answers.  What in TK: <br><br><ul><li>  Scope: question 150-250 characters, answer 200-400 characters </li><li>  Links to catalog pages </li><li>  Special requirements for mentioning products and brands </li></ul><br>  <b>Reviews</b>  For sites like Otzovik.  What in TK: <br><br><ul><li>  The volume of 300-600 characters </li><li>  Links to catalog pages </li><li>  Special requirements for mentioning products, brands, site names </li></ul><br><h2>  How much to hang in grams? </h2><br>  The texts were ordered in three batches, it took 3 months to optimize the content.  Placed as agreed (it turned out to agree quickly), about once a month. <br><br>  Total was ordered: <br><br>  <b>1. In the category:</b> <br><br>  Stage I - 6 texts, 13,000 characters <br>  Stage II - 6 texts, 18,500 characters <br>  Stage III - 4 texts, 9500 characters <br><br>  <b>2. On cards of goods:</b> <br><br>  Stage I - 19 texts, 32 900 characters <br>  Stage II - 15 texts, 25,500 characters <br>  Stage III - 12 texts, 20,000 characters <br><br>  Articles, question-answers and reviews are ordered on a regular basis.  The graph is as follows: <br><br>  <b>3. Articles on the site:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  2 per month </li></ul><br>  <b>4. "Question-answer":</b> <br><br><ul><li>  2 pieces, 1 time in 2 months </li></ul><br>  <b>5. Reviews:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  2 pieces, 1 time in 2 months. </li></ul><br><h2>  Dynamics and Results </h2><br>  According to the first list of keywords, we worked exactly a year, achieved good results, from December 2018 we agreed on a new list and started working on it.  Since the work is still continuing on new words, I propose to see how positions changed in the first six months of work, when the texts described above were posted. <br><br>  I‚Äôll say right away that we worked not only with content, so the graphs clearly show the moment when the cumulative effect of working with all the factors starts to act. <br><br>  Example 1. ‚ÄúStore saiga 12 for 5 rounds‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_i/l2/tt/_il2tt5gob5nxbi4rswekqmdtdm.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Texts posted on January 24, February 12, the site rises from the 6th ten to the 5th.  By March, we are completing the whole range of promotion works (internal optimization, reference environment, etc.) - we get a new growth jump. <br><br>  General dynamics of promotion: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-n/f6/yn/-nf6ynpyy1v6hxcyusxemgluf4m.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Example 2. ‚ÄúBuy a sight for pneumatic magnum‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zd/gh/eh/zdghehup4mxkxz99eh0a1has6qc.png" alt="image"><br><br>  This is an earlier "party" of texts, what is called "Stage I" in the case.  Texts placed after the New Year holidays, almost hit the index.  And on January 14, we get an increase of 15 positions.  Since March, another jump, as in the first case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/k6/qj/wt/k6qjwttpxqv9ewl7k6efvbj21pi.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Example 3. ‚ÄúForend on saiga‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xe/dm/c9/xedmc9y8w_edazlypt2bcsapvto.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The texts were from the second ‚Äúparty‚Äù, posted on January 28, rising from February 14. <br><br>  General dynamics of promotion: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ex/dx/mr/exdxmrgya2tauxmabxffrv6tcho.png" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Total </h2><br>  We do not in any way assert that work with texts can be used as a universal separate method of promotion.  On the contrary, we insist that SEO should be done in a complex. <br><br>  This example shows, however, that the content optimization gives certain results, so we fully admit that in some topics (with weak competition) you can achieve quite good results after working with the texts. <br><br>  From our example, it is clear that even with relatively simple keywords, the text allowed to go less than half the way to Top10, and the rest, the most difficult achievements were obtained as a result of further work. <br><br>  Examples of TK I cited in the text, I hope someone will be useful.  I‚Äôll say right away that not everything can be taken as a direct instruction: for each project we develop our own content strategy.  But something can be noted for yourself, especially if you have a similar website, where you can organize blocks of information in a similar way and this presentation will look appropriate. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/447334/">https://habr.com/ru/post/447334/</a></p>
