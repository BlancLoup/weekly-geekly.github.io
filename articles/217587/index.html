  <section class="page js-page"><h1>LZ Series Portable Batteries by iconBIT</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We see a revolution in the subtleties of smartphones, their power and display resolution.  But there are no changes in the batteries of mobile devices.  Of course, manufacturers are trying to use different technologies to reduce battery size and increase battery life.  But, unfortunately, in reality, this all shows little.  Most likely this trend will continue.  The manufacturer will have to continue to choose between the thickness of the case and performance, to sacrifice something in favor of installing a more capacious battery. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1a2/bf5/69c/1a2bf569c5477e47d4ad1541e6c0fe26.jpg"><br><br>  Although today some flagships set records for battery life.  There is no need to go far for examples: Samsung Galaxy Note 3, LG G2 (just shown in the photo) or HTC M8.  But what about those who choose their device in the first place by other parameters, and not by battery capacity?  One of the options - life at the outlet.  But for this you always have to carry a charger with you and at every opportunity to connect the smartphone to the outlet.  Another option is to purchase an external battery that will increase the operating time of the device.  Such accessories help out, if at the wrong moment the device is suddenly discharged and turned off, leaving you without communication with the outside world. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  But which model of external battery to choose?  The answer to this question depends on the specific tasks and personal preferences.  One of the main selection criteria is capacity.  You can choose a small and lightweight battery of smaller capacity, which will allow you to quickly recharge a suddenly depleted smartphone and make some important calls.  If you are faced with the task of increasing the battery life of the tablet (for example: on a business trip, at a presentation, on vacation), then it is better to choose a model with a larger capacity.  That is why the company iconBIT has released a whole series of portable batteries: <b>FTB10400LZ</b> , <b>FTB7800LZ</b> , <b>FTB5200LZ</b> , <b>FTB2600LZ</b> .  Which will be discussed below.

Although already by the name of the model (for example, FTB <b>7800</b> LZ), you can guess how much mAh is in it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5dd/cec/1bb/5ddcec1bb1542d00ed436252b113c100.jpg"><br><br>  Characteristics and precautions are located behind the box.  The mention of the fact that this device as a product is certified, gives more confidence that nothing will happen to the device being charged with this battery. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f0c/485/a8c/f0c485a8c344aab78ccedb85948dc695.jpg"><br><br>  Having unpacked the box, inside you can find only the portable battery itself, the cable for charging it and instructions with the warranty card. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/894/918/35f/89491835f1fde0cfc18bfb155c20de59.jpg"><br><br>  I would not say that the equipment is quite extensive.  In my opinion, there are no additional adapters, for example, for Apple devices.  Although now most devices use a MicroUSB connector. <br><br><h1>  Device design </h1>  Considering portable batteries, we can say that the case for all has an oval elongated shape.  Due to this, it will be quite convenient to place them in a pocket or in any compartment of the bag.  As you can see, the devices are the same in length, but different in width depending on the capacity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b1b/b2a/7e5/b1bb2a7e55320513fd41dfab3c2bd823.jpg"><br><br>  All batteries are equipped with a LED flashlight and charge indicator. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/355/8cf/922/3558cf92243a51e1d252391596f01049.jpg"><br><br>  There is no sense to consider each model in detail.  I will dwell on a battery with a capacity of 5200 mAh.  Before us is a compact rectangular bar with rounded edges.  On the front is a battery charge indicator.  To the left of the indicator is a button used to turn it on.  If all 4 diodes are lit, then there is 75-100% of the energy, 3 diodes - 50-75%, 2 diodes - 25-50%, and 1 diode, respectively, 5-25%.  When all the diodes are off, then the capacity is less than 5%. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0d1/7b6/040/0d17b604031c866fe4402647a04b5a0b.jpg"><br><br>  On the side of a portable battery, it is honestly stated that the device is made in <s>China</s> .  The company iconBIT apparently advanced marketers, so it uses the inscription "made in PRC", which translates as "made in China" (People's Republic of China).  In this way, a device of fully Chinese origin is indicated.  Well, besides this there are characteristics and certification badges. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b75/756/fc9/b75756fc98be0e33f7bae69962ec2787.jpg"><br><br>  On the right side is the usual USB connector.  The operating parameters are the same as at the input: voltage 5V, current 1A. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8ec/410/5d6/8ec4105d6430ca9c9cb874de0240d156.jpg"><br><br>  At the opposite end is a flashlight. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bd0/93d/682/bd093d682a7f3c4c0958f42e386be5d6.jpg"><br><br>  iconBIT FTB7800LZ 7800 mAh and iconBIT FTB10400LZ 10,400 mAh - batteries for those who want to connect the most voracious devices or go on long trips and want to charge the smartphone several times from a single charge of an external battery.  Both are a bit thick and heavy, one weighs 185 grams and the other 230 grams.  Both have the ability to charge two devices at the same time, and with a maximum output of 2.1A. <br><br><h1>  Insides </h1> To see what the battery is inside, I decided to disassemble the youngest model at 2600 mAh.  Understands quite hard and not without a trace.  The two halves of the housing are detached from each other with a knife. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8df/109/be5/8df109be5ed3c1fed85cc7e6cd2ffca9.jpg"><br><br>  After removing the inner filling from the case, we see the following construction here.  It is based on a control board, on which a battery is fixed by soldering. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c72/957/df5/c72957df5937b4b3854402f316a1c5ca.jpg"><br><br>  Marking used electrolytes - LGABB41865, produced by the famous company LG at 2600 mAh.  So with a capacity we were not deceived. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e44/d23/953/e44d239535f3c3557e9bbdb04e4a4be7.jpg"><br><br>  If you remove the gray film, then under it just a bare battery. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/716/3df/396/7163df396ba4e11a2c661ef87d86e234.jpg"><br><br>  USB, microUSB connectors and the power button are soldered to the control board reliably enough, and one cannot say that they can fall off in the process of using a portable battery. <br><br><h1>  Testing </h1>  In order to test the batteries, I armed myself with the same LG G2 smartphone, the battery capacity of which is claimed 3000 mAh.  For convenience, I propose to look at all the results in the table. <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  <b>Model</b> </td><td>  <b>Declared capacity</b> </td><td>  <b>Effective capacity</b> </td><td>  <b>Discrepancy with capacity</b> </td><td>  <b>The number of full charges</b> </td></tr><tr><td>  FTB2600LZ </td><td>  2600 mAh </td><td>  1800 mAh </td><td>  thirty% </td><td>  There was no complete, only up to 63% </td></tr><tr><td>  FTB5200LZ </td><td>  5200 mAh </td><td>  3810 mAh </td><td>  26% </td><td>  1 full charge, second to 27% </td></tr><tr><td>  FTB7800LZ </td><td>  7800 mAh </td><td>  5850 mAh </td><td>  25% </td><td>  Almost 2 full charges </td></tr><tr><td>  FTB10400LZ </td><td>  10400 mAh </td><td>  8340 mAh </td><td>  nineteen% </td><td>  2 full charges, the third to 78% </td></tr></tbody></table>  The results are quite expected.  After all, we all understand that energy is not just poured from one device to another, therefore about 1/5 of the nominal capacity is better not to take into account at all.  Also, all batteries have a voltage of 3.7V, and an output of 5V.  First, increasing the voltage consumes energy.  Secondly, the conversion schemes in the external battery and on the smartphone can not work with an efficiency of 100%.  Energy is lost in conversion.  Well and thirdly, the battery during charge can not save 100% of the received energy.  Part of it is released in the form of heat (a known fact while charging the phone heats up). <br><br><h1>  Prices </h1>  The iconBIT LZ series of batteries has been available on store shelves since January.  Recommended retail price: <br>  <a href="http://www.iconbit.ru/products/107913/">FTB2600LZ (2600 mAh)</a> - 890 rubles <br>  <a href="http://www.iconbit.ru/products/107914/">FTB5200LZ (5200 mAh)</a> - 1190 rubles <br>  <a href="http://www.iconbit.ru/products/107915/">FTB7800LZ (7800 mAh)</a> - 1490 rubles <br>  <a href="http://www.iconbit.ru/products/107916/">FTB10400LZ (10400 mAh)</a> - 1790 rubles <br><br><h1>  Conclusion </h1>  All four iconBIT batteries are compact and lightweight, especially the younger models at 2600 and 5200 mAh, they are ready at any moment to help out the owner of a smartphone or tablet, whose gadget is not out of time.  High-quality assembly, stylish design and low price - all this makes the company's devices a good purchase for yourself or as a gift.  The only drawback that has been noticed is that white plastic easily gets dirty and scratched if you carry batteries in a bag with other things.  However, this will not be a problem for the expert, and the rest will not be difficult from time to time to clean the pretty white accessory. <br><br>  I remind you that you can subscribe not to miss new reviews and articles <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ce4/0f1/d16/ce40f1d1668436a03738295da0147749.png" alt="image">  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/boxowerview/">on the company‚Äôs page</a> (‚Äúsubscribe‚Äù button), or on your favorite social network: <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/65b/3be/e78/65b3bee7828b50a8709d8b4efd7ed6d2.png" alt="image">  <a href="http://vk.com/boxoverview">Vkontakte</a> , in <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/af0/c75/e89/af0c75e899d6d00331728ea364e1dc43.png" alt="image">  <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/108620202455758035379">Google +</a> , in <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3f6/1c3/a24/3f61c3a24d4eeabb55869f810a17a4af.png" alt="image">  <a href="https://twitter.com/Box_Overview">Twitter</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/217587/">https://habr.com/ru/post/217587/</a></p>
