At the same time Cookies associated with Google services, it is impossible to delete using browser tools even through advanced browser settings. <br><br><div class="oembed"><twitter-widget class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" id="twitter-widget-0" style="position: static; visibility: visible; display: block; transform: rotate(0deg); max-width: 100%; width: 500px; min-width: 220px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" data-tweet-id="1044282084020441088"></twitter-widget><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br>  A new ‚Äúfeature‚Äù of Chome appeared with the latest update to version 69, which, in addition to significant visual changes, brought the audience also a ‚Äúnew UX‚Äù in terms of login.  Most users do not turn off the use of cookies, preferring security to comfort, but people who are more conscious are in a bad position, as well as all those who need to log in to their Google mail or YouTube account on other people's machines and then clear their browser history. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  The essence of the conflict </h3><br>  A few days ago, security specialist Matthew Green posted on his blog an entry <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2018/09/23/why-im-leaving-chrome/">‚ÄúWhy I'm done with Chrome,‚Äù</a> in which he gives not only a retrospective of browser development, but also a detailed explanation of why ‚Äúhe won't use chrome and use it anymore.‚Äù

      We need to step back a little and give an understanding of the situation for those who use other browsers, from firewalls to Safari.  Google Chrome has a user profile feature that is linked to a gmail email address.  This profile stores a lot of user data that lies in the cloud and is synchronized with the browser at the time of login (if the operation is performed for the first time on this device).  At the same time, the user can continue to manually enter his login passwords on Google services (such as Gmail, YouTube and others) without logging into his Google Chrome profile.  It seems adequate and convenient, yes? <br><br>  With update 69, which the company recently delivered to users, everything changed radically, as Matthew noticed: now login on any Google service led to synchronization of the browser with the profile that was associated with this service. <br><br>  <b>That is, the manual login to the email address pulled the entire user profile of this mail to the browser.</b> <br><br>  At the same time, everything happens in the ‚Äúsilent‚Äù mode and the only thing that visually changes is the user's avatar in the upper right corner of the screen: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ra/ti/yb/ratiybswrjos-1s_sxplgcru3fy.jpeg"><br><br>  Officially, the new function is called <a href="https://www.ghacks.net/2018/09/08/disable-the-sign-out-link-between-chrome-gmail-and-other-google-services/">‚ÄúIdentity consistency between browser and cookie jar‚Äù</a> and, according to the company's specialists, is not something criminal or potentially dangerous. <br><br>  As soon as the community more or less understood what was going on, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item%3Fid%3D17942252">Hacker News</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chrome/comments/9iih0w/google_quietly_started_logging_people_into_chrome/">Reddit were</a> attacked by a storm of criticism.  The topic was discussed on other platforms. <br><br><h3>  It will be fixed, but then </h3><br>  After a few days of silence, Google representatives said that they had ‚Äúheard the community‚Äù and a new ‚Äúfeature‚Äù would be finalized.  Google does not abandon its plans to pull up a user profile in Chrome by logging in to any of the Google services, but now it will make this process more obvious and controllable.  Thus, <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/chrome/product-updates-based-your-feedback/">in an official letter from Google, which was published today on the Chrome blog</a> , it says that the company‚Äôs agreed-upon entry function is a good decision that will benefit the audience, that is, they don‚Äôt intend to abandon it at Google. <br><br>  At the same time, the company claims that autologin user profile in the browser does not pose a danger, since the synchronization of user data is disabled by default.  But, in fact, it depends solely on the browser settings on a particular machine.  That is, now, to ensure your own security, the user needs to check whether profile synchronization is enabled in the browser settings or not, and only after that log in to Google services. <br><br>  In update 70, which will be released in mid-second half of October, promises to make changes to the UI for greater visibility of the new browser features: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vn/7z/qs/vn7zqs9kkrb01akynziqxvrghne.png"><br><br>  According to the Chrome team representative, the data synchronization will be manually started by the user (see the image above and the corresponding button) to ensure an adequate level of security.  In fact, now Google is trying to convince everyone around that the new feature ‚Äúis cool and right,‚Äù and everyone else simply doesn‚Äôt understand anything in UX and UI. <br><br>  The only real change that will occur with the release of version 70 will be due to nailing Google‚Äôs cookies to the browser.  Here the company really went to meet the community and promised to add the ability to delete these files from the browser, which is impossible at the moment. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/424495/">https://habr.com/ru/post/424495/</a></p>
