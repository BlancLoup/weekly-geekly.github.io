  <section class="page js-page"><h1>OCZ NIA. Thought control and what they eat it with. Overview</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I was <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/gadgets/47784/">asked to</a> talk about OCZ NIA.  The end of the year, time to sum up - because it's time to write about personal experience of using the most promising, in my estimation, pieces of iron for the year.  It all started with her purchase ... <br><br><h4>  Purchase </h4><br>  I learned about this toy for controlling the computer right there, on Habr√©, from this <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/games/26978/">post</a> .  He caught fire, became interested, the right word.  I have always loved Gibson and other cyberpunk, and here the controller, almost the same as his characters, well, even if it‚Äôs primitive, I thought.  Separate, however, ofigenie caused his presence on sale in Russia - still rarely such toys are delivered to us. <br><br>  Therefore, in August, I could not stand it and spent three hundred bucks on the toy at that time.  Well, I will describe it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Unpacking </h4><br>  Neat white box with a characteristic slogan "The future is nia".  If we consider that I looked at the box with nia just like a Papuan at a tin can, with the same reverence - an unintelligible wordplay seemed to me a revelation.  In the box they found: a heavy box with a logo that connects to the computer in one place - one piece, a hoop connected to it with three sensors - flimsy, plastic - one piece, a disk with firewood - one piece, an instruction - unexpectedly, also one.

      A characteristic feature of the instructions was the almost complete lack of information on the case.  As far as I remember, the main idea was to ‚Äúconnect the wire to the USS, this is such a small rectangular hole‚Äù.  However, a certain tutorial was also mentioned inside the program that ensures the operation of the machine. <br><br><h4>  About the principles of work </h4><br>  For a moment I will detract from the description of the experience itself, I will describe the principle of operation of the device, as I understood it.  In fact, the three sensors on the forehead perform the function of EEG, studying the oscillations of the electromagnetic field, which, as is known, the body pollutes the environment with terrible force.  That is, in principle, in terms of its technical structure, the machine did not go too far from the voltmeter, although it was very sensitive.  All cymes should have been in the software. <br><br><h4>  First start </h4><br>  Russian man does not read tutorials.  And does not listen.  Basically.  Therefore, looking in the tutorial on the wretchedly drawn face of the ‚Äúgirl‚Äôs type,‚Äù listening to the tired, annoyed voice of the announcer who spoke in English, I switched to the calibration menu as soon as I understood the essence of the preparation process for work.  This process consisted in the following: <br><br>  1) It was necessary to calibrate the device by 20-second observation of the gif, depicting a gyroscope.  It was strictly forbidden to think. <br>  2) It was necessary to check in the post-calibration menu whether the two sliders, vertical and horizontal, will obey you.  In case of failure, re-calibrated. <br>  3) Play for the best addiction in three built-in toys - ping-pong, click on the reaction speed and right-left. <br>  4) Set up a profile (the developers hoped that their device would be used exclusively in toys, instead of Claudia - but on this point I had my own thoughts) <br>  5) Enjoy. <br><br>  I sat down, as expected, at point two.  The fact is that exactly how to deal with these sliders was not written.  The only thing that was said in the instructions is a lot of beautiful words about instinctive addiction and intuition.  It was also known that specifically these two sliders are controlled by muscular tension - vertical and by sight - horizontal. <br><br>  And if the extreme position of the vertical slider was reached quite easily - well, it was completely incomprehensible to play with the muscles, after all, how to stop the slider at intermediate values.  Not to mention stopping a horizontal slider worn around the screen - well, it‚Äôs hard to stare at one point and at the same time do something or think about something, it‚Äôs difficult ... Again, I didn‚Äôt want to play muscles - all the fun from the toy was lost.  However, I was encouraged that the ‚Äúmuscular‚Äù channel was just one of many. <br><br>  However, after about three hours I played ping-pong, not to say that without straining, but without any problems.  Helped this game with the settings.  But to a greater degree - the fact read on the Internet that, it turns out, a crookedly made toy requires grounding at least in the form of a hand on the body of the box.  And this is critical.  I do not know, why the developers did not bother to deal with this problem at the design stage, but it is a fact. <br><br>  What is even more interesting - indeed, the development of the device occurs intuitively, as the developers promised.  Looking ahead, I‚Äôll say that after a week of experiments I didn‚Äôt need any visible action to activate even the channel responsible for muscle tension.  It looked like this - sitting comrade with a stone face in front of the monitor, and all.  However, it should be noted that in the development I was somewhat helped by the experience of my exercises with meditations and other oriental crap. <br><br><h4>  Using </h4><br>  Common decomposition looks like this: <br><br>  It should be noted that nia has eight joysticks - the so-called brainfingers.  One joystick - muscle tension, the second - the direction of gaze, three alpha and three beta channels.  For each joystick, you can program four buttons on the keyboard or - in total, we have 32 buttons in theory.  The joystick of ‚Äúmuscular tension‚Äù, as it turned out, does not require a strong, visible tension - if you learn to strain and relax at will.  The same applies to the rest.  In practice, however, there are fewer buttons - firstly, it is not always convenient to score four channels at once ‚Äî one would be able to cope with, secondly, it is almost impossible to work with the channels separately.  Perhaps I didn‚Äôt make enough effort to learn, but in my performance, raising the alpha channel alone made sure that, God forbid, the third alpha and the second beta, if I'm not mistaken.  I don‚Äôt know how to do it in science, but I got the impression that the channels for the joysticks too much dependent on each other were chosen, although with others it may be worse - who knows. <br><br>  And how to study with these same joysticks to work?  There are two options.  Severe Chelyabinsk men display a summary of the channels on the screen and meditate in front of her.  Less severe and more successful citizens first launch a shooter, and wait for the intuitively able to learn how to walk in it without the keyboard, only with a mouse and a mouse.  The second method is more convenient - although it causes a feeling of wild helplessness at first, but it gives results.  After that, you already more or less understand what and how, and you can already work more productively and simply with a summary of the status of the joysticks.  It turns out like walking with your feet - can you explain what you think about to move your legs?  Well, I can not.  The downside, however, is that both of the above methods take time, a desire to learn, and effort.  Well, patience.  Is it worth it, that is the question. <br><br>  The situation is aggravated by the fact that the joystick, controlled by the direction of gaze, used by default to work with the horizontal plane (in the sense of ‚Äúright-left‚Äù), is made extremely crooked.  I don‚Äôt know what training is needed to cope with it - even when I got used to this controller on this joystick, I had false positives in about one in five cases.  And this is annoying. <br><br>  The sensations when playing without Claudia (as well as when blocking hot keys on the keyboard) are awesome.  Especially when playing - you will laugh, but there is a certain effect of presence, which was not on the clave.  However, there are three facts that so far pereheryvayut positive emotions from use.  They are: <br><br>  1) Purely subjective - it is extremely unpleasant to wear a plastic hoop on your head for a long time.  If he was a metal or at least a more pleasant to the touch plastic!  If it were not required to tighten the fastener every ten minutes!  The fact that in order to go to smoke it must be removed, and then calibrated again - and not talking.  But it tastes. <br><br>  2) A more objective fact - I wondered for a long time why the test for the reaction rate produces strange, too high results.  I, of course, brake, but not so much.  And on the mouse in similar tests give out much better results.  Once in 9. What is the matter?  As it turned out, the drivers of research institutes pretty loaded computer.  My Core2Duo 1.86 GHz just does not have time to cheat everything in more or less real time.  It is not critical for work, for toys, for which it is intended and very much so.  In addition, because of this very voracity of firewood, it is impossible to launch a more or less modern toy with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãit (the same Mass Effect, for example).  Brakes and hangs. <br><br>  3) The biggest minus - the concentration that is required when using.  For example, do you want to use niyu simultaneously with the keyboard and mouse as an additional clavus, for example, when designing or launching a toy that is different from jerky postralus.  I somehow got used to that when working, what to think when playing - in the game about its plot, and just about life in parallel with rest, while working - actually, about what I am doing.  Nothing, having sensed the ‚Äúextra‚Äù thought, can quite perceive it as a certain command and select from the list of buttons the one to which this thought most resembles.  The result is predictable.  And unpleasant. <br><br><h4>  Total </h4><br>  Likewise balance. <br><br>  Minuses: <br><br>  - difficulty in mastering <br>  - braking <br>  - requirements for the level of concentration <br>  - incomplete iron <br>  - lack of digestible manual <br><br>  Pros: <br>  - this is thought management!  What other advantages do you need ?! <br>  - besides, it works, even if it is crooked! <br><br>  Total: <br><br>  I do not regret money.  The pleasure of using received.  Touched the future.  Played and abandoned.  I do not recommend anyone to buy - for the same reason as I abandoned - for the time being, on the basis of ‚Äútwitching and forgetting‚Äù.  But when a revised model of thought management comes out, it doesn't matter who releases it, the developers of the research institute or someone else will take it without hesitation. <br><br>  PS Added a photo from the manufacturer's website.  Unfortunately, I couldn‚Äôt make my photos, the camera is not at hand. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/47906/">https://habr.com/ru/post/47906/</a></p>
