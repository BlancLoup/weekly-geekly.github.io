      Jason Martin is an enthusiastic teacher of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).  He wants the school curriculum of every American school to focus on such subjects as science, technology, engineering and mathematics.  But public schools are simply unable to afford to conduct such disciplines. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Why do you need it </h4><br>  ‚ÄúThere is a so-called‚Äú missed opportunity window ‚Äùin public education, says Martin,‚Äú Public schools located in low-income areas simply do not have sufficient financial resources to organize a school workshop or production laboratory. ‚Äù <br><br>  Thus, Martin decided to provide pupils with these missing classes.  His truck "STE (A) M" (the letter "A" in the name of the truck means "art") travels from school to school in the Atlanta area, delivering 3D printers, laser cutters and saws, as well as laptops for low-income students . <br><br>  Most of the learning process is based on project objectives.  One class was offered to create a camera for a videographer who has no hands from birth.  Another class was offered to brainstorm on "how to make eating vegetables more fun." <br><br><h4>  Motivation </h4><br>  Martin‚Äôs own learning experience prompted Martin to launch his ‚Äúclass on wheels‚Äù project. <br>  ‚ÄúI grew up in different regions of the state of New Jersey, and different places of residence influenced my education,‚Äù says Martin, ‚ÄúHis quality varied greatly ‚Äî from the level of rural schools to the level of schools in large cities.‚Äù <br><br>  In high school, Martin enrolled as a local bricklayer.  ‚ÄúIt was hard work, but he made me believe that everyone should have the technical skills and be able to handle the tools.‚Äù <br><br>  After nine years of teaching in public schools in low-income areas, he wanted to help improve the situation. <br><br><h4>  How did the project begin </h4><br>  First, Jason redesigned the metal repair truck into a mobile innovation lab and made his debut with her at a crafts fair in Georgia in 2013.  Within five months, Martin managed to collect grants in the amount of $ 100,000. <br><br>  These funds allowed him to purchase a used truck and convert it into the first full-featured STEM car.  The Atlanta Department of Public Schools also allocated $ 20,000 to him to launch his project in two schools in the spring of 2014. <br><br><h4>  Implementation </h4><br>  Martha's ‚ÄúWheels Class‚Äù offers two training programs for schools, each of which is designed for 20 days and requires that half of the students attend classes. <br>  In one school, "we parked a truck in the school parking lot and turned the class inside the truck and trailer," said Martin. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jw/q7/gh/jwq7ghomksoxv-xpyngbsdf6ddu.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Martin's truck from the inside</i> <br><br>  The classes are taught by teachers and artists hired by the Community Guilds, a non-profit organization of Martin.  They cover a wide range of subjects - from programming and electronics to art and design.  In each class, the ratio of teachers and students is one to five. <br><br>  The second option is direct classes in the classroom.  According to Martin, his goal is to actively involve teachers in schools and help them in the implementation of STEM principles in the daily educational process. <br><br>  The cost of training programs varies from $ 21,000 to $ 26,000, which, according to Martin, is a more economically viable option for schools than hiring a full-time STEM teacher. <br><br><h4>  Results and plans </h4><br>  KIPP WAYS Academy is a public secondary school in Atlanta, it was one of two pilot schools where a new approach to learning was tested. <br><br>  School director Dwight Ho-Sang says that 90% of his students are from low-income families; it is simply impossible for them to hire a full-time STEM teacher.  Instead, he hopes to organize more frequent visits to STEM trucks for his students. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt was amazing to give our students the opportunity to gain practical experience,‚Äù he said.  ‚ÄúIt benefited each of them.‚Äù <br><br>  500 students from 10 public schools in low-income areas have already completed a 20-day educational program.  Martin says that so far, expenses have been offset by grants, the county‚Äôs municipal budget and corporate sponsorship. <br><br>  Martin's goal is that by 2019, the STEM truck fleet served 4,000 Georgia students annually. <br><br>  ‚ÄúSTEM trucks provide equal educational opportunities for all students.  I want to turn this project into a nationwide initiative, ‚Äùsays Martin. <br><br>  What do you think about this initiative and its implementation?  Can a similar project exist in Russia, and will it be successful?
