      <b>Forecast for 2016:</b> <br>  1. Social content will become even more <i>‚Äúshoppable‚Äù</i> - consumers will be able to go directly to the buying process by clicking on the image, and thereby attract additional income for both sellers and social networks ( <i>Approx Collector: a statement the other day VKontakte on the opening of the API for online stores - just the movement in this direction</i> ). <br><br>  2. Public discord over the <i>inviolability of personal correspondence</i> will reach a new level.  Some users will show growing concern about data privacy, while others will be completely against the fact that their private information will be accessible to external services.  ( <i>Note: Collector: the statement of some major mobile operators on the provision of a new service for companies is the ability to receive data where employees with corporate phones are now - one of the total control messages</i> ). <br><br>  3. Finally, a solution will be found for the payback of ‚Äú <i>Social ROI</i> ‚Äù, and social media will become a full-fledged marketing channel.  ( <i>Note: Collector: WhatsApp‚Äôs refusal of service fees ‚Äî only $ 0.99 per year ‚Äî fits perfectly into Facebook‚Äôs long-term management strategy, with profits exceeding $ 1.5 billion, and Tsukererg has become richer by $ 6 billion</i> ). <br><br>  <b>NATALIA SOKOLOVA</b> - Head of <b>Brand Analytics</b> , market leader in analytics and monitoring of social media in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, Natalia‚Äôs industrial research on social media in Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine - ‚Äúdesk books‚Äù for thousands of digital professionals, and the metrics developed by her Social media is used in the reports of the largest brands. <br><br>  1. There will be a <i>standardization</i> of the social media analysis metrics and ways to solve typical PR and marketing tasks.  A new profession is emerging - <i>a social media analyst</i> . <br><br>  2. PR-managers will no longer limit themselves to working with the media and conducting offline campaigns and will start to master <i>promotion and media measurements</i> in social media on a massive scale. <br><br>  3. In the Russian segment of social networks <i>, the role of Facebook</i> will <i>increase</i> .  Primarily for business and business contacts.  ( <i>Note: Collector: The current leader in Russian-speaking social media - VKontakte - will require additional efforts to curb the flow of maturing social network users: after school and institutes, young people are involved in new contacts on Facebook and LinkedIn, and Instagram and WhatsApp are already part of the Facebook empire</i> ) <br><br>  <b>JADE FURUBAYASI</b> , Social Media Manager. <br><br>  Forecasts for 2016: The emphasis in search engine optimization from search engines will shift to social media.  People turn to Google when they want to find something, but when it comes to hot news, <i>Google will not help anymore</i> - search engines are not fast enough.  To find out the latest news and events, we turn to Twitter or Facebook.  In 2016, social media will begin to have a much more serious impact on search engine optimization. <br><br>  <b>BEN DONKOR</b> is a social media analyst at <b>Microsoft</b> , his main task is to analyze and apply the data to develop recommendations for product development strategies. <br><br>  <b>Forecasts for 2016:</b> <b><br></b> <br>  It will be a year of <i>social analytics</i> ( <i>Note of the Collector: "Social Intelligence", for more, see the article</i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="https://megamozg.ru/company/palitrumlab/blog/23572/">"The most complete guide to analyzing social media"</a></i> ). <br><br>  Many brands are finally fed up with the fact that the one who pays the most wins in social media, especially when it comes to competitors who have already allocated a separate budget for this.  The costs of such brands to work with social media are increasing (software, advertising, marketing, etc.), and to justify these costs they need special tools in order to understand how much more money and the payback period of investments will be needed.  The term ‚ÄúSocial ROI‚Äù will cease to be a curse and the method of its calculation will appear. <br><br>  <b>JACOB KERTIS</b> is the marketing director at <b>CON2R</b> , his main task is to expand the reach and optimize current marketing strategies by introducing new solutions and trends: developing and maintaining company social media pages, a corporate website, and offline activities to increase sales. <br><br>  Forecasts for 2016: Listening and responding to the opinions of customers and users - these tasks will be the most important issues for brands seeking to maximize their interaction with consumers.  Social media will no longer be measured by the number of subscribers, the <i>key indicator will be the quality of work with people</i> . <br><br>  <b>URI BAR-JOSEPH</b> is Senior Director of Marketing at <b>Simply Measured</b> .  Believes in marketing based on the data collected, but also loves the elements of creativity in it.  He writes about strategy, decision making, future marketing, and the impact of social networks on marketing. <br><br>  <b>Forecasts for 2016:</b> <br><br>  1. Marketers will continue to work on <i>combining online and offline</i> activities.  Opportunities for geo-location of social media users will become even more popular among companies with a ‚Äúdual presence‚Äù (on the Internet and offline, for example, the same online stores of non-virtual goods, taxi services, etc.). <br><br>  2. Creating a <i>single company image</i> (online and offline) will be one of the most important problems; the first standards for organizing this issue will begin to appear.  Social networks can also be included in the process, helping companies to establish an even closer relationship with users. <br><br>  3. A large redistribution of spheres of influence will occur through the acquisition of one of the major social networks.  My guess: <i>LinkedIn will be purchased by SFDC</i> ( <i>Collector's Note: Speech about Salesforce, which bought Canadian Radian6, a well-known social media analytics system, in 2011</i> ). <br><br>  4. Most likely this year we will see the first serious attempts to <i>produce our own original content of</i> the social networks themselves. <br><br>  <b>BRIAN HONIGMAN</b> is the CEO of <b>Honigman Media</b> , a content marketing consulting agency that develops strategies for clients to work with content generation services and its promotion.  Brian's materials appear regularly in the Wall Street Journal, Forbes, and Entrepreneur.  It works with a large number of customers, starting with startups and ending with well-established brands like Thomson Reuters, Marc Ecko and People Magazine. <br><br>  <b>Forecasts for 2016:</b> <br><br>  1. Users will devote more time to various social platforms, requiring brands, non-profit organizations and government structures to invest in <i>their own platforms</i> , instead of using them only as intermediaries and redirecting users to existing services. <br><br>  2. In the coming year, marketers will have to learn to <i>be exactly where the user is</i> most active. <br><br>  <b>STANISLAV BRUSTER from Inside Social</b> creates systems that help marketers measure and increase the impact of their social media activities.  The former financier Brewster worked in sales and corporate finance before he realized that zeros and ones are much more interesting in the software code than in financial models. <br><br>  <b>Forecasts for 2016:</b> <b><br></b> <br>  1. The growing trend towards ‚Äú <i>real-time services</i> ‚Äù.  Brands invest in platforms such as Snapchat and Periscope.  Further popularization of the video will help in the dissemination of data between different channels of distribution of content. <br><br>  2. Users from 13 to 22 years old will spend <i>more time watching videos</i> on Snapchat than on traditional TV. <br><br>  3. Free communication channels will become a driving force in <i>integrated marketing campaigns</i> .  Brands will be more actively using paid media services to create cross-platform campaigns. <br><br>  4. The boundaries between <i>online and offline</i> will become more and more blurred.  E-commerce companies will continue to invest in ‚Äúphysical distribution‚Äù, and traditional sellers will invest in e-commerce, allowing to combine virtual and social content.  Multi-channel marketing will become a universally accepted norm, as brands will strive for more holistic contact with consumers both in and out of the network. <br><br>  5. In 2016, the content transmitted through <i>augmented reality</i> will be widely distributed, which will entail a more natural distribution of advertising information to the public. <br><br>  <b>Vasily Black</b> , director of marketing communications <b>Brand Analytics</b> .  Vasiliy worked for many years as a top manager at the 7 Days PH, then led the development of a mobile platform for distributed research. Since 2015, Brand Analytics has been developing partnerships with social networks, government agencies and agencies in Europe, Asia and America. <br><br>  <b>Forecasts for 2016:</b> <br><br>  The general trend is that, until recently, search engines and contextual advertising were the main drivers for the development of the Internet.  Now we are in the process of <i>changing the business driver that social media is becoming</i> .  And this means the structuring of this channel in all directions: content production, advertising placements and measurements.  Some write, others advertise, others measure.  All in one bottle the business does not buy and "take" the digital budgets of brands will not work. <br><br>  Therefore, whoever is good at writing or filming will grow like new media and compete with the media for audiences and budgets.  <i>Content marketing, editorial and SMM in the current sense are not suitable for scaling</i> and have limited growth potential.  Unless, of course, the brand creates its own media, which is the structuring of the activity. <br><br>  If we talk about placement tools, then the context is taken over by <i>targeted and native advertising in social networks</i> .  Native advertising on other media platforms is expensive and therefore not as relevant.  A fresh example is the opening of advertising tools on Instagram for Russia, which is currently the fastest growing network. <br><br>  Around the announced trends and in addition to them, the <i>market for data, platforms for building new products</i> and, in fact, the market for tools for placing, and for measuring and evaluating efficiency will be developed. <br><br>  In this context, the key theme of 2016 may be the <i>standardization of metrics for social media measurement</i> and a broader market acceptance of industry research as the main navigator for marketing and advertising budgets.  At the same time, media analysis metrics will be adapted for real-time benchmarks and in-depth analysis.  The trend of social media analysts is much wider than just evaluating the effectiveness of the social media channel.  Social Media Analytics allows you to evaluate the <i>effectiveness of the use of offline budgets</i> . <br><br>  <b>Results from the Collector:</b> <br>  The first month of the year has passed, as we see, some experts' forecasts have already begun to come true.  Remember: ‚Äúwho is forewarned is armed,‚Äù that is why correct predictions and people helping us move in the right direction are so important. <br><br>  You can share your predictions for 2016 in the comments.  Why not?  Gods do not burn pots, but people. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298286/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298286/</a></p>
