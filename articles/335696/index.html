What is SEO or the effect of black and white cinema </h2><br>  It would not make sense to start this article if, while explaining the term SEO, you had to rewrite the definition from Wikipedia.  In addition, the explanation at the definition level does not reveal the full picture.  I suggest you consider search engine optimization from a different angle, so to speak, from the outside, reviewing the whole picture, and not just a separate segment.  It is important to understand that in the context of this article we will look at SEO in general, and not some particular case.  Therefore, those who came for specific recipes, do not waste time, go back to the search.

      The person is arranged in such a way that, meeting difficulties, he tries to give money to get out of the situation as a winner.  In the Internet business, everything is the same as in everyday life, and SEO has become like a black and white movie, where the webmaster offers some sophisticated workarounds for search algorithms instead of making a website high-quality.  The very idea that the user needs to show high-quality content begins to blur, and the budget size comes to the fore: the one who pays the most is the first. <br><br>  Fortunately, progress does not stand still, and search engines constantly <a name="habracut"></a>  are improving.  It's no secret that search engines use a huge number of ranking factors in their algorithms, plus machine learning.  ‚ÄúAt the time when you‚Äôve sharpened the page for some parameter, the search engine retrained,‚Äù said the late Ilya Segalovich. The masters find it harder to bypass search algorithms every year, and the cost of services increases accordingly. Any site owner wonders if you should SEOs or give the same money in advertising. Now the Internet business is built on the principle: if you want to pay - pay! Here you are, Adwords and Yandex Direct. For you, the whole Universe of contextual advertising, just do not interfere with making the search qualitative. <br><br>  Our task is to learn how to lay a strong foundation at the planning stage of the project, which will provide a solid foundation for the development of the site and an awareness of the overall picture, which provides the right guideline.  It serves as a guideline - a quality resource for high-quality search.  No need to know all the ranking factors.  Trying to guess or experimentally identify the relationship between some factor and and the position in the issue, plus to please the search engine - this is a black and white movie. <br><br>  Lyrical digression: The Seoshnik comes once in a bar, restaurant, buy alcoholic beverages, clubs, the best bars in Moscow, and order a banquet in a restaurant. <br><br>  This is my favorite joke about SEO, everything in it is good and harmonious.  It perfectly conveys the essence of the problem - we please the search engines, not the user.  The multiplicity of ranking factors due to the fact that search engines are focused on quality, on color cinema. <br><br>  So, let's understand. <br><br>  First of all, we define who we are and what we want.  Do we want to focus on quality and develop ourselves in this direction, and maybe we want to realize ourselves professionally in contextual advertising.  Again, it is necessary to understand that high-quality search engine optimization of the site and contextual advertising are closely related and it makes no sense to abandon one in favor of the other, but it‚Äôs up to you what the ratio to use! <br><br><h2>  2. The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsearch engine optimization (the right bee) </h2><br>  In the market of SEO services there is nothing, any whim for your money.  The masters will gather you a semantic core, scatter key words correctly in the text, prescribe beautiful headings, etc., will justify the importance of the SMM strategy and much more.  But why often the result is not the one that was expected?  Is SEO service a drug that a trusting man in the street puts on?  Nothing like this!  Strong professionals work in promotion studios and each of them knows a lot about his field, but without a clear guideline SEO turns into chaos and drug addiction, you pull a hippopotamus out of a swamp: pull it here - it sinks there, pull it there - it drops here. <br><br>  Refer to any SEO specialist and he will be monotonous, using special terms to chew on you, that optimization is a complex process in which it is necessary to observe, apply, hope and believe ... And so it is!  Optimization is a very complex set of activities, but the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsearch engine optimization is simple and accessible from the original source.  Google and Yandex openly declare that the purpose of the search is to give answers to questions.  Accordingly, your site must first answer the user's question, and second, it should not prevent the search engine from responding to the user's request. <br><br>  <b>Directly from Google Help:</b> <br>  Help google find your site <br>  Help Google to index your site <br>  Help the user find their site <br><br><h2>  3. Promotion strategy (unarmed ninjas) </h2><br>  We divide promotion into two parts: 1 Part - server, 2 Part - client. <br><br>  Part 1 contains: <br><br><ul><li>  Server optimization </li><li>  Code optimization </li><li>  Setting permissions for indexing </li><li>  Redirects </li></ul><br>  Part 2 contains: <br><br><ul><li>  Site structure (sections / directories) </li><li>  Content (titles / descriptions / content) </li><li>  Internal reference weight </li><li>  External reference weight </li><li>  Analysis of user behavioral factors and conversion </li><li>  Audience analysis </li><li>  Marketing (promotions / discounts / affiliate programs) </li></ul><br>  At the same time, Part 1 has priority, and until the foundation is ready, until the server database is set up properly, it is not advisable to proceed to Part 2. <br><br><h3>  Acceleration factors </h3><br>  Google more than other search engines loves fast sites, especially on mobile devices.  The behavioral factors of the visitor, in particular, the bounce rate depends on the speed of loading the page.  Without a properly configured and optimized server, it will be very difficult for you to achieve record numbers.  Without a fast server, the work of the webmaster turns into an endless routine bondage, in which there is no end to the edge.  The key to success of SEO is an optimized server, and if you have not optimized it, your film will be black and white. <br><br>  On the factors affecting the speed of opening the site: a <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/334236/%5Biz-pesochnitsy%5D-kak-uskorit-sayt-ili-fak/">detailed review.</a> <br><br>  Having a mobile site is great, but having a fast mobile site is even cooler!  Imagine for a moment that our mobile site is faster than a mobile application!  Think this does not happen?  But in fact it would be cool to implement a mobile version of the site, not inferior to the application.  And this solution will free you from the extra costs of developing a separate application, as well as renting accommodation in appstore and playmarket. <br><br>  Google loves fast mobile sites, so we definitely use AMP technology, we also use the schema.org microdata markup and gradually move on to code optimization. <br><br><h3>  Code optimization </h3><br>  First we optimize the code.  Do not hesitate to go to the w3c validator <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">https://validator.w3.org</a> and fix all the jambs of the hypertext markup.  In my Linux there is a cool browser (QupZilla), in which the item ‚Äúcheck for validation‚Äù is already sewn in the right button of the mouse.  We also try to remove unused styles in css, combine duplicate styles.  Optimize image size.  All graphic design elements cut into layers are written in css, up to the logo.  We insert images by tag only in articles and product cards. <br><br>  Not valid code leads to a decrease in performance to a lesser extent than the same large images, but to a greater degree the non-validity misleads search engines and client browsers.  The severity of the situation is that not a valid code violates the DOM logic that browsers rely on to display the page and search engines to understand the structure.  As a result, you conceived one thing, but Google understood the other, you shot a color movie, and the user saw black and white, and the webmaster's idea was not conveyed to the user.  Only the right bees make the right honey, only the right webmaster validates! <br><br><h3>  Setting permissions for indexing </h3><br>  So, your site should give the correct server headers.  The answer is 200 OK, the answer is 404 - not found, the answer is 403 ‚Äî forbiddeen, the answer is 301 - moved permanently.  Your site should not give an error 500 - server error, an error 502 - bad gateway. <br><br>  Also, it is necessary to hide all service sections from indexing, such as: admin panel, user section, confidential information, modules, CMS core.  For indexing, we leave only the sections with content and directories with the theme of the site design.  In the following reviews I will teach dac what the correct robots.txt should be <br><br>  Do not neglect the services of Google and Yandex Webmaster.  All comprehensive information in a convenient form, take it and use it.  Learn third-party data collection services, the functionality of which covers something in more detail.  Arm, do not be an unarmed ninja, fighting with your bare hands is not effective and time consuming. <br><br>  So, to summarize, we can highlight the following points of successful SEO: <br><br><ul><li>  We determine the direction (context or organic traffic) </li><li>  If the context (focus on the budget) </li><li>  If organic (focus on quality) </li><li> We optimize the server </li><li>  Optimizing content </li><li>  Adding marketing tricks </li></ul><br>  By developing the right websites demanded by both the user and the search engine, we are improving the quality of the domestic segment of the Internet.  Since we ourselves are users, we send search queries daily and look for answers, we therefore improve life not only for those around us, but also for ourselves. <br><br>  With the above arguments, I urge dac, friends, to shoot only color movies, be the right bees and use only high-quality nectar, arm with services and be cool ninjas.  Let's improve the quality of Runet together! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/335696/">https://habr.com/ru/post/335696/</a></p>
