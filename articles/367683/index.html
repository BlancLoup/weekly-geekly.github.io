  <section class="page js-page"><h1>IBM Watson helps you organize your daily routine.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9e4/842/b23/9e4842b234c8426a9885bec4df2c5dbc.jpg"><br><br>  IBM and Under Armor have teamed up to create an advanced application to help you create the right daily routine.  Simply put, now the application based on the cognitive abilities of IBM Watson will tell you when to eat, sleep and play sports.  The application itself is called ‚ÄúUA Record‚Äù.  The IBM Watson cognitive skills program was introduced at CES 2015. <br><br>  The idea is for Watson to analyze daily user activity, sleep and nutrition data.  The person enters this data into the application, and the cognitive system evaluates and analyzes the information.  It is also interesting that the application works not only with the data of its user, but also with information received from other users of the system. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Example: the user enters all his data, including weight and duration of sleep (5 hours).  The system, after analyzing this data, tells the user that UA Record users of his age group are about 5.7 million people.  Using the data of people in this group, the system showed that the lowest body mass index is observed in those people who sleep between seven and eight hours every night.

      Many users will find such assistance from the program very useful.  Indeed, it is one thing when doctors, nutritionists and other specialists talk about healthy lifestyles from TV screens, pages of newspapers and magazines (including online publications).  And it is quite another when an impartial program makes its judgment based on the data of millions of real users. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d8a/d9c/2fc/d8ad9c2fc4b040b093193dbcbf615345.png"><br><br>  In the future, IBM and Under Armor plan to add weather data for the Weather Channel service, recently acquired by IBM.  What for?  So that the user can plan trainings, walks and business meetings based on the weather forecast data. <br><br>  For example, if after a couple of days the system predicts the sun, you can run on the street.  And, on the contrary, if according to the forecast it rains and bad weather, it is better to go to the gym. <br><br>  Next year, Under Armor will add new features to its cognitive training system, the foundation for which is IBM Watson.  Among others will be added such: <br><br>  <b>Individual selection of the training program: the</b> application, using the data of Watson's analysis for a specific user and his preferences, will help to create a customized training program. <br><br>  <b>Power system:</b> using technologies such as Watson Visual Recognition and Watson Discovery, the service will be able to closely monitor the power of an individual user. <br><br>  <b>Weather and environment:</b> this has already been mentioned above.  Using the data of the weather forecast and other information, the program will be able to modify the user's lesson plan according to specific conditions. <br><br>  By the way, IBM services can now predict not only bad weather, but also possible catastrophic events, including a volcanic eruption or an earthquake.  This system is called IBM Sequoia, information about <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/ibm/blog/267046/">it is available</a> in the company's blog on Geektimes. <br><br>  As for the UA Record application, perhaps not all users will like the fact that the system uses personal data.  But all this information is anonymized and not tied to the username. <br><br>  Anyway, this application looks like a project from the future.  However, this is already a reality that millions of users will soon be able to appreciate. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/367683/">https://habr.com/ru/post/367683/</a></p>
