  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Crazy QIWI</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I stumbled upon the <a href="http://tuprikov.habrahabr.ru/blog/71685/">post of</a> user <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/tuprikov/" class="user_link">tuprikov</a> and decided to move the comments about Qiwi from my blog. <br><br>  Most recently there was a reason to be happy for the work of the Qiwi payment system, and for this reason: after making a payment on Yandex.Money from the personal account of the system, an automatic call to the subscriber occurs with a notification.  In this case, you need to choose a further action - that is, to refuse the payment or confirm it.  The thing is pleasant, there is a feeling that I was not mistaken in numbers, the payment was fixed and problems should not arise in the future.  One thing remains unclear - what happens when the phone is turned off, especially when you transfer a check from your system account to any type of account, it is not printed by default. <br><br>  Because of my own laziness and convenience, I keep some passwords in the browser.  Accordingly, the password issued to me by Qiwi, I forgot after a second and I was in no hurry to remember.  Today, it was necessary to make a payment from your account, again on Yandex.Money, and there was no time to do it right away from the payment terminal.  A home laptop with saved passwords, as usual, was not at hand - in general, I had to recall the password remembering button that I hated as a developer. <a name="habracut"></a>

      Qiwi offered a choice of three options: go to a certain page and enter a pin, which is much easier to remember, and I remembered to call a <i>toll-free</i> number, or send a <i>paid</i> SMS.  The cost of one SMS is 15 cents (almost 5 rubles). <br><br>  Attempting to enter a pin was not successful, I was told that I already had a password, and I would not go in connection with this to smoke bamboo.  Help clearly indicates the possibility of password recovery by pin, that is, brazenly lying in the face of a stunned user = me. <br><br>  I didn't want to call a toll-free number, and the premonition was justified, but more on that later.  In response to the SMS sent (for which, I am sure, 15 cents were withdrawn) a notification was received about the technical problems of the system.  Naturally, relying on the experience of all such Russian services, the second SMS was sent (for which, with 100% probability, money was also withdrawn).  The answer was the same, another minus in karma. <br><br>  And now came the turn to call a toll free number 8-800.  A tender voice, as far as a gentle voice message recording can be, suddenly reports that users of Moscow and the region <s>go to the forest</s> should call on a completely different number.  And it turns out another important point - a call from a mobile phone to this number will be charged. <br><br>  Having decided to reach the end, I called.  First I answered Olga.  After hearing my request to restore the password from the personal account, she immediately switched me to a <s>technical support</s> specialist for working with the personal account.  It is clear that the problem was not recorded, and I will have to repeat it as many times as I will be kicked from specialist to specialist, which I was not destined to reach.  After quite human communication with a female call center operator, the automatic replied to me again, that naturally all techies are busy.  At the same time, the voice asked to call back later.  Why Olga did not immediately say that they are all busy remains a mystery.  Apparently, the shameful duty was removed from the people with an ulterior motive. <br><br>  As a result: I had to spend 3 sms (the last one I sent after 4 hours and finally got the password), I had to spend money on a conversation and listening to automated delusions, I had to spend time. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/71687/">https://habr.com/ru/post/71687/</a></p>
