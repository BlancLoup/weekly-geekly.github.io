      Today it is not customary to copy "from screw to screw" and distribute blanks with fresh distributions.  The Internet is available to everyone and literally shines from every teapot. <br>  At the same time, the educational component remains relevant.  The festival has confirmed its importance this time. <br><br>  The organizers invited the speakers to talk about any interesting topic from the field of Linux and free software.  As a result, the final list covered serious "admin" tasks, graphics, game sector and audio music applications. <br><br>  While the speakers registered topics on the <a href="http://nnlug.ru/lif0519">NNLUG site</a> , the organizers made announcements, including on <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/450938/">Habr√©</a> .  Immediately, a task list in GD was compiled, open to all who would like to join the training. <br><br><h3>  What did the organizers plan? </h3><br>  8 reports, use-demo fresh Linux-distributions, gaming stands of different caliber and, as it turned out - a music session in the final. <br><br>  All this is in the spacious assembly hall of the NRTK with decent acoustics and a tea table in the corner. <br><br>  <i>Below are pictures!</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  And Saturday came.  In the air was a terrible holiday spirit (C) </blockquote><br>  Alexey was the first to find more empty tables and set up a gaming stand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-0/vv/zm/-0vvzme4slokw4f7xn4fixbxamc.jpeg"><br>  <i>Neon glow is not <b>weak iron</b> and gamers are right there.</i> <br><br>  The gamer series was enhanced by RetroPie with joysticks (the setup was assembled and tested by Yegor). <br><br>  The problem of starting the SEGA-emulator was not solved. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2z/nr/hy/2znrhyh1gafblagiviv3oo6zqnk.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1o/it/_8/1oit_8ma_einrtdo2qwqk0migl8.jpeg"><br><br>  <i>There was a unique representative of the now-disbanded project - PocketChip.</i>  <i>Local hackers persuaded the owner to give for a week for review.</i> <br><br>  Meanwhile, Sergey and Alexey revived the demo machines, on which the installation of the following Linux distributions was immediately launched: <br><br><ul><li>  Ubuntu 04.04.2 </li><li>  Lubuntu 19.04 </li><li>  Solus 4.0 Budgie </li><li>  Astra Linux CE (2.12) </li><li>  Alt-linux  The version is not new, so do not specify. </li></ul><br>  Ubuntu MATE 04/18/14 on RPi 3 is located just to the side. <br><br>  One of the participants rightly asked: <br><blockquote>  Why so many <b>different</b> Linux? </blockquote>  The question is correct, I did not find what to answer.  I was running Debian Lenny on my home machine with KDE3 and it was enough for typical office and multimedia tasks. <br><br>  It seems that in addition to disparate desktops - different distributions may still have their own, unique philosophy, approaches, configuration and security nuances.  Many of the distributions recommended in the NNLUG community had to be set aside for further study. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">A few photo-screenshots and superficial impressions of the distributions - under the spoiler:</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1v/vy/fp/1vvyfp4shngivsjtdjpfo2wwxdm.jpeg"><br><br>  <i>Ubuntu 04.04.2.</i>  <i>The unsuccessfully taken snapshot basically reflects my initial impressions of Gnome: a tablet.</i>  <i>In principle, not bad if you have the habit of "scattering eyes" on a bunch of icons.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lu/xr/m8/luxrm8tq6r5exgpg1doh1cuzxqw.jpeg"><br><br>  <i>Lubuntu 19.04.</i>  <i>Kouteshno and succinctly.</i>  <i>Perhaps my number 1 choice of the candidates.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zt/lr/jc/ztlrjc0toqqujyqjx4xwxqgzlvu.jpeg"><br><br>  <i>Solus 4.0 Budgie.</i>  <i>Certainly beautiful: translucent windows, grouping by running applications, but a little something.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hy/og/nm/hyognmdicjipo9zcgo5qztmddsu.jpeg"><br><br>  <i>Astra Linux CE (2.12).</i>  <i>2nd place in the personal rating.</i>  <i>Installed the longest since it is expected (due to the size and announcements on the site) has established a lot of things.</i>  <i>During the installation, I asked for a complex password and a bit later I displayed a list of checkboxes defining a more formidable level of security.</i>  <i>Given the approach to the creation - a candidate for more detailed study in the future.</i> <br><br>  Alt-linux recalled a distant KDE3.  Very simple with specialized for learning software. <br>  And among it was basic! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/y8/0h/7w/y80h7wznooip2nei1uylzdri4ky.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/km/6h/ky/km6hkyg541ydo_nqusdd2xu4mha.jpeg"><br>  Ubuntu MATE 04.18.2. <br></div></div><br>  With a slight delay, the event officially began.  Next will be a subjective point of view on the reports.  Fully familiar with them can be in the record <a href="https://youtu.be/FRhJ-rvQdHY">6-hour stream</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_0/zs/pk/_0zspkqimz0hof9ep0wdxdtebqe.jpeg"><br><br>  <i>Denis talks about an interesting Meshroom package.</i>  <i>In short, on the basis of 50-100 photographs of an object from different angles, the program builds a 3D model with a formed texture.</i>  <i>Were demonstrated nuances of the settings and the results obtained.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hn/gq/cw/hngqcwbfjcpziejhtf1ojcegzpi.jpeg"><br><br>  <i>Vladimir added virtual gravity, mentioning Proxmox VE: mostly user cases and general impressions.</i>  <i>The release of this debian-based tool is not frequent, but for its support and updates, more special conditions are required.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9e/zc/ig/9ezcig1x6x_xpb8ayeu9wsuu2ak.jpeg"><br><br>  <i>About a good gaming developing package for children GCompris told Innocent.</i>  <i>The software is capable of small people from ~ 3 years old and contains different types and types of small games.</i>  <i>The game form can additionally stimulate the development of children: expanding horizons, the development of logic, the approach to children with autism.</i> <br><br>  The new version of Blender 2.8, according to Denis (his second report), is more stable than some analogues.  Adjustment of functionality.  Changes in the interface. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_g/vx/zs/_gvxzsmptpwsm5vmjrpwitxn9se.jpeg"><br><br>  <i>Artem Kashkanov ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/radiolok/" class="user_link">radiolok</a> ) praises Nextcloud.</i>  <i>He says that he has been using it for a long time and very well.</i>  <i>A good option to have a local "analog DropBox."</i> <br><br>  Artyom Poptsov ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/avvvp/" class="user_link">avvvp</a> ) mentioned the great Audacity, making a philosophical basis by demonstrating the correct sine wave.  Good package, good compressor, de facto standard for initial sound processing under Linux (my personal opinion). <br><br>  In more detail about audio processing was told and demonstrated in the next report by Ilya.  He, as a professional musician and composer, has successfully used Ubunty Studio in his work.  The story touched upon the basics of the Linux audio system and the more specific Supercollider and Pure Data packages. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/p9/mm/jq/p9mmjq_jsx4hsrhm20uhkw58opm.jpeg"><br><br>  In the final, Fedor unfolded the paradigm of free software in N dimensions and without straining at all ‚Äúsculpted figures from it‚Äù.  Historical background, facts, comparisons - the report turned out to be insidious criticism of FOSS.  The strings of supporters of free software were stung and gradually the narrative passed into a round table from those who ‚Äúkept the spark‚Äù and were really not indifferent to the situation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dn/ba/e_/dnbae_gnlnndidcviwh7weyf3ki.jpeg"><br><br>  In the installation zone (taking a couple of seats in the last rows), a mini-project ‚Äúinstall FreeDOS on PentiumMMX‚Äù began to boil.  At the same time, the machine from iron had only 20GB IDE HDD, no USB.  The DVD ROM was not there. <br><br>  The format of the official image FreeDOS helped to understand Ivan. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/z3/do/wo/z3dowoxh8spat50ei7jtixeuntw.jpeg"><br><br>  Then there was a little mess with jumpers.  The DIN-split keyboard turned out to be inoperative - both Enter keys were not pressed ... The local CADR hacker space rescued, on the shelves of which exactly the same working one appeared.  The time, however, was lost, and the "testers" achieved only boot from the system's HDD installer.  Quickly figure out how to install the system on the same HDD failed and the project will apparently remain until the next festival. <br><br><h3>  Total </h3><br>  The event was attended by about a hundred people.  Despite the departure from the regulations and technical overlays - people liked it.  A start was made on a series of more specific events in the ‚Äúmaster class‚Äù and ‚Äúseminar‚Äù formats - it‚Äôs too early to say the details, see if the initiative will continue. <br><br>  Approximately 10 people participated in the organization, coordinating orally through a chat. <br>  7 days were allocated for preparation.  The budget is zero.  Promotion - posts on 4 specialized resources.  Comments on posts can be divided into two classes: ‚Äúinstall fest is not relevant‚Äù and ‚Äúcool that such events are still being held‚Äù. <br><br><h3>  Acknowledgments </h3><br>  Information support from <a href="http://www.it52.info/">www.it52.info</a> was very helpful - a huge respect to the it52-team! <br><br>  Thanks to NRTK for the wonderful hall, equipment and support in carrying out the event and separately respect to the staff of NRTK! <br><br>  Acknowledgments to the speakers and to all who provided their systems, devices, hardware and provided hot tea and cookies! <br><br>  In preparing the article, text and photo materials from Innokentiy and Artyom Poptsov were used. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/452570/">https://habr.com/ru/post/452570/</a></p>
