Of all the possible methods of action, man chooses the simplest.  Well and, accordingly, since a person wants to buy something, it is desirable that he should not encounter problems along the way. <br><br>  Separate hopes for simplicity were pinned on the birth of e-commerce.  Internet marketing theorists have long been telling us that in the digital age, we will meet with virtually no limit on customizing everything.  It will be possible to choose everything in the product, ranging from color to function. <br><br>  Yes of course. <br>  In fact, all these beautiful tales have degenerated into releases for Russia only, for example.  No customization, eat what they give.  As a result, the vaunted diversity has been reduced to zero.  But this is still half the problem.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Try a legal way to purchase in Russia, for example, a series about the unkind Dr. House.  But in the quality you need and with the voice acting you need.  For example, I love HD 720p, original voice acting and Russian subtitles.  Now decide to encourage the copyright holder.  Happened?  Of course not.  Because there is no him, this release in this capacity.  Just does not exist in the "licensed" version. <br><br>  I decided here to buy a disk of Rob Dugan.  If someone doesn‚Äôt know, this is the author of the longest piano theme from The Matrix.  Peculiar, rather ‚Äúcinematic‚Äù music.  I go to one store, I ask.  As expected, the big round eyes and "NO".  In the other - joyfully - ‚Äúis!‚Äù.  Well, I think I can enjoy now.  If everything was so simple ... They brought the disk.  Bob Dylan, yeah. <br><br>  That is why for a significant part of people the easiest way to get media content is not at all licensed.  This is not because people are malicious freaks.  And simply because otherwise it is simply impossible to get this content.  Not ‚ÄúDIFFICULT‚Äù, not ‚ÄúEXPENSIVE‚Äù, but ‚ÄúIMPOSSIBLE‚Äù. <br><br>  Piracy is so widespread because people CAN'T get licensed media content in a simple and convenient way.  Not "pirates, bastards, all flooded", but "I can not get it any other way."  And do not say that "pirates are running ahead."  Is it with the powers of copyright holders and content producers ahead of the pirates?  Not funny.  If a group of enthusiasts in the work is ahead of the corporation - the corporation should clean its own ranks.  This is at least logical. <br><br>  Are there any positive examples?  More than.  Steam, Apple Store, pricing policy for game manufacturers in Russia.  Everywhere, where the acquisition is easy, it happens quickly and is inexpensive.  After all, in essence, the alternative with copyright holders is small.  Either they will sell their content cheaply (after all, hand on heart, copying on the Internet happens all the time), or it will be copied for FREE.  And DRM is a temporary measure and carries more problems.  Any DRM will be hacked.  Especially if it interferes.  And he always interferes. <br><br>  Will people use all these services?  And where will they go!  Most users do not know what a torrent and p2p are.  And if they know, they don‚Äôt want to mess around (as I didn‚Äôt want to mess with eMule at the time, and with the iPhone unlock this summer - why? And so it works!).  Therefore, the path of purchase called "Click the mouse here!  Just a dollar! ‚ÄùWill always go ahead of the way to get content like‚Äú install the program, then register on the tracker, then download the file, then keep the computer turned on (for rating) ‚Äù. <br><br>  And the monetization of content through fines - about which they wrote not so long ago - is already beginning to raise many questions.  Yes, and with the "Pirate Bay" is still not resolved. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/72956/">https://habr.com/ru/post/72956/</a></p>
