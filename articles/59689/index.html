I do not want to discuss why, why, what moved me to move (someone is fun and comfortable only in New York / London, and someone is very pleased in the village), but I will try to just bring some information.  There are quite a few people from Australia on the site, I hope somewhere they will correct me, they will add something.  I am pleased to answer all questions in the comments. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  So let's start with immigration. </h5>

      No, of course, you can find an employer and come on a work visa, I even know a couple of people who have arrived (for example, <a href="http://huge-pink-dream.livejournal.com/">huge-pink-dream.livejournal.com</a> ), but it is much easier to get a residence permit.  First, the work visa is tied to the employer, the loss of work leads to the loss of a visa (I was in such a situation, rather unpleasant feelings).  Secondly, I think the immigration process is much simpler, and it can be much faster than finding an employer willing to sponsor (not financially, but with documents) a work visa. <br><br>  The process of obtaining a residence permit is described in some detail on the website of the immigration authority ( <a href="http://www.immi.gov.au/">www.immi.gov.au</a> ), in booklet 6 ( <a href="http://www.immi.gov.au/allforms/booklets/1119.pdf">www.immi.gov.au/allforms/booklets/1119.pdf</a> ).  You can go through the process yourself or by using the services of an immigration agent.  By law, only registered agents ( <a href="http://www.themara.com.au/">www.themara.com.au</a> ) may provide immigration services. <br><br>  I will not describe the process in detail, because my experience in submitting documents is almost seven years old and during this time something has probably changed.  The whole process consists of three stages: pass the exam in English (IELTS), confirm qualifications (IT specialists here is expensive either in the Australian Computer Society - <a href="http://www.acs.org.au/">www.acs.org.au</a> , or to engineers (IEA) - <a href="http://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/">www.engineersaustralia.org.au</a> ) and actually apply for a residence permit.  After submitting the documents, after a while, a package of documents will be received for the medical examination.  And after some time, if everything is in order, a visa grant will come, after which it can be pasted in the consulate.  A visa is issued for five years, after which it can be extended.  Or you can (now after 4 years of residence in the country with a residence permit), apply for citizenship. <br><br>  Upon arrival it is necessary to live on something, and therefore <br><h5>  Work in IT </h5><br><br>  It is best to start with a wonderful post about how <a href="http://www.gday.ru/forum/%25C0%25F0%25F5%25E8%25E2/3623-%25CF%25EE%25E4%25E3%25EE%25F2%25EE%25E2%25EA%25E0-%25EA-%25EE%25F2%25FA%25E5%25E7%25E4%25F3-%25CC%25EE%25E9-%25F1%25EE%25E2%25E5%25F2-%25E2%25ED%25EE%25E2%25FC%25EF%25F0%25E8%25E1%25FB%25E2%25E0%25FE%25F9%25E8%25EC.html%3Fpostdays%3D0%26postorder%3Dasc%26start%3D0%26sid%3D2e2a174e939122c76d565cdfaeb89807">much money to have with you on arrival</a> . <br>  The numbers there are somewhat outdated, but gives a great idea how to estimate the right amount of money.  This does not mean that you can not go with $ 50 in your pocket, but a certain amount to start will give more confidence.  Unlike Canada, Australia does not require proof of the presence of a certain minimum amount in the account. <br><br>  The population of Australia is only 20 million people, which, respectively, affects the number of vacancies, for example, even in very prosperous two or three years ago, the number of vacancies on request With ++ Melbourne was much less than at the height of the dotcom crisis in California. <br><br>  The job is sought mainly through friends and on <a href="http://www.seek.com.au/">www.seek.com.au.</a>  There are a couple of sites, like <a href="http://www.careerone.com.au/">www.careerone.com.au</a> , but the main one is Seek. <br><br>  The average salary in different cities can be found on the website of one recruiting agency - <a href="http://www.hays.com.au/salary/default.aspx">www.hays.com.au/salary/default.aspx</a> and for IT people - <a href="http://www.hays.com.au/salary/pdfs08/Information%2520Technology.pdf">www.hays.com.au/salary/pdfs08/Information%20Technology.pdf</a> .  Salaries in advertisements are usually given annual without deduction of taxes, may also include the mandatory 9% of pension deductions (package) or these 9% may be in excess of the presented annual salary.  The tax scale is progressive, up to 45%, taxes can be estimated on the website of the tax authority ( <a href="http://www.ato.gov.au/">www.ato.gov.au</a> ).  Roughly, estimating from the average salary, 25-30% of taxes will go.  Plus, the state pays a certain amount for a non-working wife and children (not very much). <br><br>  I will add that going to Australia with the hope of earning is a rather utopian idea, there is much more money in America or Asia. <br><br>  So, the work was found, there is money <br><h5>  Costs </h5><br><br>  The main item of expenditure is housing.  All of Australia, in general, is a large one-story village.  Lodging is sought on <a href="http://www.realestate.com.au/">www.realestate.com.au</a> or <a href="http://domain.com.au/">domain.com.au</a> .  All work is concentrated mainly in the City (Melbourne is a small 1.5-meter runner for 2 km).  The cost of housing, respectively, decreases with distance from the City.  Public transport, in general, is not bad, but, for example, trains in the City (I‚Äôm talking about Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth can be quite different) go every 10-15 minutes per hour peak and once every half hour the rest of the time.  The road to work (if you live 30 km from the City) can take from 40 minutes. <br>  The cars are quite expensive, you can estimate the prices at <a href="http://carsales.com.au/">carsales.com.au</a> .  And, in general, the distance of the island from the rest of the world affects all the goods here are expensive and the choice is smaller than in Europe, not to mention America.  Gasoline at the moment, costs $ 1.05-1.3 per liter (price depends on the day of the week, the cheapest on Tuesday-Wednesday).  1 Australian dollar is approximately 24 rubles, or 76 US cents.  Insurance for a car (depending on the car and driving experience) costs between 150-200 dollars.  Car registration (again, Victoria, in other states may be different) - $ 600 per year. <br>  Food prices, in general, are the same (something is cheaper, something is more expensive) as in Russia. <br><br><h5>  Nature, weather </h5><br><br>  Australia is quite a big island, so the weather varies quite a lot.  Cold and low humidity in Melbourne, a little warmer in Adelaide.  Warmer, but wetter in Sydney, even more humid in Brisbane, Darwin.  Quite good weather - warm and low humidity in Perth.  Melbourne: in the summer heat, 25-30 degrees, a few days can be 40-45 (but at low humidity they feel much better than, for example, in Seoul 30 degrees with 100% humidity).  In the winter of 7-8 degrees at night, 12-17 in the afternoon.  The ocean is quite cold, you can swim (no wetsuit :-)) only in January-February. <br>  Yes, 8 out of 10 of the most poisonous spiders live in Australia, but in everyday life you find them quite difficult, and the more north you go, the more likely they will meet :-).  There are sharks, but they also like the northern waters more, as do poisonous jellyfish :-) <br><br><h5>  What else to read-see </h5><br>  Photo: <br>  <a href="http://www.genkin.org/blog/">www.genkin.org/blog</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.ozshots.com/">www.ozshots.com</a> <br><br>  Forums: <br>  <a href="http://www.oztrovok.org/threads.asp">www.oztrovok.org/threads.asp</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.ozzi.ru/">www.ozzi.ru</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.gday.ru/">www.gday.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/59689/">https://habr.com/ru/post/59689/</a></p>
