      Generation Z buyers want a simple and functional profile to receive customized offers from stores and brands.  They use different devices and access points, and often they are no longer eager to communicate with the staff, as their grandmothers burned, visiting the good old markets. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In order to somehow adapt to time, retailers should raise their heads from the old approaches and pay attention to the clouds. <br><br>  Taking advantage of their benefits, you can deliver an adequate user experience. <br>  For centuries, retail leaders have been on the market, experiencing recessions and fashions, but have not yet met crises like today. <br><br>  For example, in one of the civilized countries of the West, 14 stores are closed every day. <br>  Inevitably need to develop. <br><br>  Unfortunately, many retailers are constrained by the dilapidated infrastructure, the old inherited systems, not to mention the sysadmin, the friend of the director, who sits on a big salary. <br>  Legacy often slows down progress, but some systems and programmers are already dying out, and new ones will better study some Go rather than conditional Cobol. <br><br>  On the other hand, sectors such as finance are investing heavily in IT at 7% of revenue, emphasizing the fundamental importance of being at the cutting edge of technology.  To pity money for such investments means losses for a retailer. <br><br>  Now in sales it is important to use all the capabilities of the IT infrastructure.  Amazon Go will come to Russia sooner or later.  Do we want him to dare with our arrival our dear Pyaterochka with an old and kind aunt Klava at the cashier as Yandex swept through local taxi drivers? <br>  The decision to deploy IT operations in the cloud can be difficult and needs the blessing of business owners. <br><br>  And it is important for them to know the answers to all their questions.  So, what questions should retailers ask before migrating to Cloud4Y? <br><br><h3>  First question </h3><br>  <b>How much will we raise on this money?</b> <br><br>  Nearly two-thirds of retailers say migration will not pay off.  They need to look at this in more detail and in terms of long-term investments.  Think of what migration to the cloud will add to their business and what pains it will eliminate. <br><br>  In today's retail cloud offer to significantly reduce costs.  The possibility of mass scaling and the ability to throw off at least part of the capital expenditures on infrastructure, tuning with the mouse, and not the brigade of movers - all this is very cool and saves a lot of time, nerves and money in the moment. <br><br>  Enterprises feel an increase in revenue from the removal of data storage, computing and other services to outsource through the pay-as-you-go model to the clouds rather quickly. <br><br>  Golovnyak with capital costs, expensive licenses, support for software and databases, infrastructure and an EXTREME scaling ends where the cloud service begins. <br><br>  The main thing is for the director to assess the potential losses from the fact that the company will be left behind and the advantages of getting ahead: <br><br><ul><li>  The cost of data transfer is incomparable with the cost of updating the fleet of half-dead ancient servers. </li><li>  Although the growth of data in the cloud can last for quite a long time, in the cloud you can fine-tune exactly the space and resources you need right now, be it a rush on Black Friday or for the New Year. </li><li>  The cost of service changes especially when it comes to internal management.  Using the cloud, you only pay for what you received after the fact.  No spending on the supply, relocation, clearance, dismissal of employees.  All this is included in the cost of cloud services and it is much cheaper. </li></ul><br>  The possibilities of the cloud are vast, but you need a reliable company that will tell you how to squeeze the most out of them.  Today's century is the century when efficiency is achieved through narrow specialization.  Professionals for their work - a pledge of general welfare. <br><br><h3>  Second question </h3><br>  <b>What applications and data will we start with?</b> <br><br>  More than one fifth of retailers have already transferred data and calculations to the clouds.  The rest have already outlined their backlog and monetary losses.  Although some old software is still difficult to drag, however, expanding resources leads to improved performance. <br><br>  Autoscaling of resources and performance in the cloud can result in benefits for the applications used, which can distribute the load across multiple servers. <br><br>  Cloud orchestration tools can be deployed for monitoring and dynamic scaling according to current requirements and without the participation of people. <br><br>  It makes sense to start the migration from the applications that were originally intended for the clouds.  A gradual migration strategy may be appropriate for dilapidated applications, since  This approach will allow you to make a minimum of changes to the code. <br><br>  Just remember that there is no hurry and the need to move everything at once and instantly.  Conduct a thorough analysis of the workload, determine what to focus on, and then use it as a road map to spin the maximum profit from going to the cloud. <br><br><h3>  Third question </h3><br>  <b>How to track resources?</b> <br><br>  Unlike the bearded way of storing data on a static server, the cloud is dynamic and cleverly thought out.  Autoresources and elasticity mean that anyone in your office can take on as much as you need in the moment.  There are also a number of special accounts for business units with resources provided in advance. <br><br>  Ease of deployment creates some organizational risks.  Organization of security, restriction of access to resources, cost overruns due to redundancy of resources and changes in software compatibility. <br><br>  To avoid this, that's all, retailers should consider operating and management models that would track running applications and make adjustments when resources are scarce or oversupply.  Without such monitoring, there is a risk to bury money on applications that will fail to hang running.  It is also better to analyze accounts for used applications.  All this can be automated, by itself. <br><br>  Resource management is vital for migration, as every unused resource eats up money and undermines real savings. <br><br>  Our experts will help resolve all such issues for the benefit of any business. <br><br><h3>  Fourth question </h3><br>  <b>How do we protect the environment?</b> <br><br>  Transferring applications and data to the cloud does not mean relieving the owners of this data.  Retailers carry it with respect to the personal data of their customers. <br><br>  Since the release of the GDPR in May 2018, all organizations have the additional obligation to meet a certain level of requirements.  Data leaks are very critical, because  it is necessary to keep them legally in front of the relevant law enforcement agencies.  The reputational loss of a cloud provider during such episodes may threaten the closure of a business.  This makes us ensure the highest possible level. <br><br>  Cloud provider leaders provide robust physical servers protected through a virtualization layer.  With our army of engineers, the support of you and your data is a matter of resolution. <br>  No cloud provider can guarantee 100%, because  this is the zone and your responsibility as the owner of the information.  However, we help migrate and configure everything to achieve the maximum level of protection. <br><br>  Malicious software has become more inconspicuous.  Many have gained access to it and can launch an attack.  The availability of ecosystems for cyber attacks allows any shkolote to join the spread of viruses. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3s/j0/7x/3sj07x4if2auwqufs2tkzz5oc38.jpeg"><br><br>  Hacking is not the same as it was before. <br><br>  If at the dawn only geek enthusiasts were engaged in this, then today's gangsters are well-motivated financially.  As a rule, they work from an organized criminal group or a government like some kind of North Korea. <br><br>  Business went online, grabbing money there.  Cybercriminals, while unable to break into data centers or your system administrator‚Äôs security clerk, are able to gain control over the employee‚Äôs account. <br><br>  For example, Petya has ushered 2,000 enterprises in 65 countries, blocking users of their own ecosystems. <br><br>  More than 9,000 infected files are detected per day, and 700 virus families are running all the time.  Initially, extortionist viruses like WannaCry and Petya did not have a specific goal.  Cybercriminals have changed tactics and are now marking their targets with weak points. <br><br>  Almost all businesses use clouds today, especially in the west.  This allows shareholders to have access to company information from anywhere, even from a mobile phone on a safari in Africa.  Security issues in some cases are not as strict as in Cloud4Y, and this can lead to security threats. <br><br>  In order to hack a great network, it is enough to get access to an email or the employee‚Äôs computer by sending a bogus letter with a malicious link.  If an employee clicks on it, consider that it is missing. <br><br>  Achilles heel are smartphones and IoT.  To simplify the company give access to important information to employees from personal phones.  The quantitative growth of personal devices raised the risks.  Cyber ‚Äã‚Äãattackers can track passwords that employees enter when logging in from smartphones or tablets.  The Internet of Things is also growing with a lag in security.  Sometimes solutions are simply unsafely written by curved coders. <br><br>  In the future, even more cybercrimes are expected with a big profit.  Cryptodoping attacks using foreign computers to bookmark crypto-mines will require CPU power and scalability of cloud services.  But for many organizations, this is all indifferent. <br><br>  Attacks on mobile devices will become more frequent.  But there will already be used not narrowly targeted viruses, but combines.  And when Skynet is filmed and he takes over organizations, hackers will attack him to gain the power of artificial intelligence.  Getting control over IoT will be easier.  It will be one of the weaknesses that are most difficult to protect. <br><br>  Moreover, the authorities of the European Union and Russia are rolling out all new laws on personal data and their protection.  This means that organizations will not be able to protect data and will be forced to make it publicly available. <br><br><h3>  Fifth question </h3><br>  <b>How do we answer for your leadership, if it is all profacit?</b> <br><br>  By dragging data to the cloud, you get your risks.  Without normal managers, you can lose everything, given that a different top manager may accidentally lose his phone, which he logged in to.  The human factor remains on your conscience. <br><br>  Prudent and usable adminpolitika and operational model refers to the standards that are set by cloud trends.  Given the dynamic nature of the clouds, the traditional approach to management is too slow.  We need a kind of automation, the old approaches need to be updated. <br><br>  Retail in Russia is time to grow, using available technology to compete with the chances of winning.  In Innopolis Magazians are already being tested without cash desks and personnel.  Are you laughing?
