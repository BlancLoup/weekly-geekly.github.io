Analysis of foreign SIM-cards</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/eff/b8f/925/effb8f925fe54fce8cc006276974bc2e.png" alt="image" align="left" hspace="2">  Before traveling, I simply bought a local sim card and at the end of the trip I threw it away.  But then travel became more difficult, there were transplants and several countries in one trip - and each time it would not be enough to buy SIM cards neither time nor money.  And then I started looking for the perfect sim card that works worldwide and for a penny).  Naturally, there is no such card, but I have found several products that complement each other perfectly.  The topic is relevant not only because of the summer.  Recently, roaming was canceled in the EU, with the northern countries having special rights to take the roaming fee, and the southern ones changed the tariffs.  Infu updated for himself, but it is useful to everyone traveling abroad. <br><br>  There are three main universal products on the market: <b>MTX Connect</b> , <b>DrimSim</b> , <b>AirBalticCard Card</b> .  Four prepaid tariffs from foreign operators, which can be bought independently on the next trip, or through intermediaries in Russia are also worthy of attention: <b><i>Saunalahti</i> from Elisa FI</b> (Finland), <b><i>Internetikaart</i> from Elisa EE</b> (Estonia), <b><i>Mundo</i> from Orange ES</b> (Spain), <b><i>Vodafone 25</i> from Vodafone IT</b> (Italy). <br><br>  The price range is decent.  Below you will find a large comparative table with countries and prices, as well as a brief summary of each product. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Mini table:

Bold highlighted best prices, simple text - good prices, gray - not very favorable prices.  In assessing, he proceeded from the fact that + 10-20% does not solve anything to the price, he gave preference to tariffs without packages - with payment for actually consumed traffic. <br><br><h3>  <a href="http://airbalticcard.com/">AirBalticCard Card</a> </h3><br>  The leader in prices is only in 13 exotic countries where packages of ‚Ç¨ 1 / 10MB / day, ‚Ç¨ 5 / 50MB / day and more profitable are available.

Of the bonuses - ‚Äúfree chat‚Äù - free use of messengers for 90 days after recharging the balance ( <i>upd. I personally did not work, maybe it does not work only in Russia, or it works well, oh, very slowly</i> ).  The sim card does not have a number, which means that voice / sms is not available.

The company listed is nominal of BVI.  The product has been recently launched on the market, but this is not the first project of the founder, the previous domoy.eu is also associated with sim cards.

Roaming in a limited number of countries. <br><br>  Uniform and understandable tariffs, but traffic packages are only available with a subscription fee, change of tariffs with and without subscription fees costs ‚Ç¨ 3.65.

You can also buy from an intermediary in Russia - <b>‚ÇΩ2700</b> with a balance of ‚Ç¨ 20.  Topup.orange.com card replenishment from ‚Ç¨ 5 with a commission of ‚Ç¨ 0.65. <br><br><h3>  <a href="http://vodafone.it/portal/Privati/Tariffe-e-Prodotti/Tariffe/Tariffe-per-smartphone/Vodafone-25">Vodafone 25 from Vodafone IT (Italy)</a> </h3><br>  The leader in prices in the EU, along with Orange ES, but the number of roaming countries is much smaller.  Uniform and clear tariffs without a monthly fee.  Payment for a package of traffic ‚Ç¨ 6 / 1GB / month.  Control from the site or from the mobile application.  Of the bonuses - a sim card with a number. <br><br>  The card can be purchased at the offices of Vodafone in Italy.  You can also buy from an intermediary in Russia - <b>$ 3400</b> with a balance of ‚Ç¨ 15.  Recharging the card from ricarica.vodafone.it from ‚Ç¨ 5. <br><br><h3>  What I use myself ... </h3><br><ul><li>  AirBaltic - for voice on the <a href="http://airbalticcard.com/ru/services/free-calls-from-skype/">go</a> worldwide, <a href="http://airbalticcard.com/ru/services/free-calls-from-skype/">via viber / skype</a> . </li><li>  Saunalahti - for trips to Finland and installation in a router in the EU. </li><li>  DrimSim + MTX Connect - together they cover 90% of the countries worldwide for traffic, ordered, I will try both. </li><li>  from Orange ES I will refuse. </li><li>  A megaphone with the <a href="https://spb.megafon.ru/download/~szf/b2b/korporativnyi_bezlimit/new/price_KB_szf_dom_SPB.pdf">Corporate Unlimited</a> tariff gives you free EU members and the ability to connect the <a href="https://spb.megafon.ru/roaming/world/bezlim_internet.html">World Online</a> option with a particularly urgent need. </li></ul><br><h3>  Recommendations </h3><br><ul><li>  Ideally, to have two international sim-cards, and that with at least one it was possible to make an outgoing call with a voice.  A bunch of <a href="https://drimsim.app.link/b96sKaHF6E">DreamSim</a> + MTX Connect Pay As You Go is a great option at the moment. <br><br></li><li>  Before each trip (or on the way to the airport) check the best fares in the countries of destination, because  for products like DrimSim and AirBaltic Card, they are constantly changing, and home operators release interesting options like World Online (Megaphone) and Zabugorishte (MTS). <br><br></li><li>  If you need a lot of traffic for a mobile router in Europe, but without buying packages and subscription fees - Saunalahti from Elisa FI, or any other local sim card with similar nishtyak. <br><br></li><li>  At least once a year, you need to replenish the balance of SIM cards with a minimum amount and take some kind of paid action, for example, sending sms. <br><br></li><li> It is better to disable autopayments and use a separate bank card in product currency (EUR) for replenishment.  AirBalticCard and DrimSim store the card data on your account, and MTX Connect creates a pre-approved payment when you pay with PayPal.  I use USD and EUR cards from <a href="https://rocketbank.ru/loves/sergey.zakharov">Rocket Bank</a> or <a href="https://www.tinkoff.ru/sl/1dWlBBwPtwl">Tinkoff</a> for payments, the products are free and very convenient! <br><br></li><li>  Considering that in daytime packages in the daytime it is usually considered time until 00:00, and for Elisa EE it will be Estonian time, Elisa FI - Finnish ... You need to be ready for double write-off, and keep the necessary amount of money on the balance in order not to be left without traffic. </li></ul><br>  A productive and vibrant journey! <br><br>  <b>upd v.1 - Orange &amp; Vodafon</b> .  There is information, confirmed by some comments, that the products from Orange and Vodafon have two significant drawbacks. <br><br>  Firstly, it is impossible to replenish the balance with a card of another country (for example, Russia) through the native cabinet.  Because of this, you have to resort to the services of intermediaries and pay a commission, or somehow through friends in these countries to replenish the account.  Personally, I always replenished Orange ES through topup.orange.com with a commission. <br><br>  Secondly, these guys can block SIM cards, which they spend most of their time not in their home country.  I can neither confirm nor deny the information regarding Elisa, but the last Finnish sim from Elisa FI lived with me for over a year until it broke through my fault. <br><br>  <b>upd v.2 - DrimSim vs.</b>  <b>MTX</b> .  Having both sims on my hands, I can say that MTX out of the box has no messengers for free, and DrimSim has a strange SMS rating for activating Apple FaceTime. <br>  Finally, the sim came from MTX and after a few dances with a tambourine earned.  It should be noted that the support is fast, trying to help. <br><br>  <i>The cost of traffic</i> . <br>  DrimSim charged me ‚Ç¨ 0.15 for SMS.  Judging by the info from the support, this is an SMS from Apple to activate FaceTime.  However, nowhere in the tariffs I found ‚Ç¨ 0.15 per SMS in UK. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">screenshots</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/33c/799/001/33c799001dde4d3c9fe5f02a54cdde55.png" alt="image"></div></div><br>  MTX did not write off a cent, as stated - they are redirecting to their website to activate the tariff.  However, there are no free messengers either.  Telegram seems to be writing <i>Connecting ...</i> , then <i>Updating ...</i> , but nothing works.  Whatsapp is constantly in <i>Connected</i> state <i>....</i>  After contacting the support free messengers promised to connect. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">screenshots</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/b92/c27/5bf/b92c275bfe7545eab9edbe6df6f984a7.png" alt="image"></div></div><br><br>  <i>Search network</i> . <br>  DrimSIM - iPhone does not need to be turned off, the network catches instantly immediately after inserting the sim and starts to work.  MTX is capricious, you need to turn off the phone and wait a long time until it catches the network;  but even after that the network is unstable and constantly falls off by the first time, although the reception level is normal (-90dB).  Perhaps the whole thing in Tele2, which is a partner of DrimSIM. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Screenshots</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/278/485/1bd/2784851bdd124508bde97f56b7b26d85.png" alt="image"></div></div>  When inserted into MiFi (Huawei E5776), both sim are picked up only after about 3 minutes. <br><br>  <i>Shipping</i> <br>  DrimSim - the next day by courier in St. Petersburg.  MTX - 10 days by registered mail of Russia, tracking sent on request. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/334286/">https://habr.com/ru/post/334286/</a></p>
