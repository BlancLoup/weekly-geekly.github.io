    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/338dd1e1/5e36937c/d27ffbcd/ddd51a9f.png" align="left"><h5>  Colorpen </h5>  Online training is widely used in refresher courses for working students over 25 years old, and almost never used in schools and universities.  The problem is that many disciplines that are taught in schools and universities, involve practical training.  Basically, it‚Äôs about the student writing something on the blackboard or notebook, and the teacher corrects it.  This is not done with Skype, Webex and other programs for video conferencing. <br><br>  The developers Pavel Aleinikov, Alexey Petrov and Vladimir Platov created a prototype service that allows you to use a tablet and write by hand during video lessons.  The ColorPen service imitates a blackboard and chalk, a notebook with abstracts and a pen.  The student writes, and the teacher corrects the errors.  Records can be saved and edited later.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/school-online/">+++</a> <br><br><img src="http://wanted.vc/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/logo1.png" align="left"><h5>  Wifixer </h5>  The brothers Dmitry and Alexander Klimushiny and almost a dozen of their like-minded people create the WiFixer service, an alliance of wireless users.  It should make wi-fi ubiquitous and affordable.  If you have an access point, you can easily sell access to the Internet.  And vice versa, if you need a wi-fi point, you can buy megabytes or online time from other union members. <br><br>  Access is sought using a special program - it is posted on the WiFixer website.  The cost of Internet access is determined in auction format.  If there are other networks nearby, it is unlikely that the owner of the point will break the high price.  WiFixer earns a percentage - from 25% to 5%, depending on the number of access points from one owner.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/wi-fi-alliance/">+++</a> <br><br><img src="http://wanted.vc/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/logo.gif" align="left"><h5>  Wordsteps </h5>  The creators of WordSteps offer their own method of solving the problem of memorizing words when learning a new foreign language.  The service allows you to select unfamiliar words from sites, documents, books, translate them and view received "cards" through the website or on any mobile platform. <br>  The project site was launched in April last year, during its operation the number of registered users is growing very rapidly.  This is not the first project of this kind, but it is distinguished from its rivals by the best on the market algorithms for learning and memorizing words, free functionality and a convenient user interface.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/words-to-remember/">+++</a> <br><br><img src="http://wanted.vc/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/logos.png" align="left"><h5>  Taxi in the network </h5>  Entrepreneur Yevgeny Smirnov from Novosibirsk once dropped out of college to start a business.  He was engaged in IT-outsourcing, created an online catalog of goods and services Roxi.ru, and now engaged in a new project - ‚ÄúTaxi on the Net‚Äù, a taxi order service via the Internet. <br><br>  The problem that the startup has to solve and its team is well known to all.  Ordering a taxi is almost always a tape measure.  When you apply to a traditional taxi service, you never know who will come for you - ‚ÄúLada Kalina‚Äù or Mercedes.  Even worse, it is impossible to predict when this will happen - it happens that there is no free service at one service nearby, then a taxi order turns into a telephone call.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/taxi-guys-inexpensive/">+++</a> <br><br><img src="http://wanted.vc/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/logo_bartermill.png" align="left"><h5>  Bartermill </h5>  The Kyiv businessman Rostislav Malenko and three of his associates create a bartermill exchange of goods and services in the network where they can conduct transactions without money.  It happens like this.  Someone knows how to photograph, and someone owns hairdressing.  When a photographer needs a haircut, and a hairdresser has a photo session, they meet on the site and agree among themselves. <br><br>  Over time, the site will appear all the elements of this exchange.  For those who still want to use their money, they will still appear - the portal will have its own currency, convertible into dollars.  There will be an opportunity to pay with debt receipts, insure their transactions, and maintain document circulation.  Kogdzha this will happen to the creators of the site will be a considerable number of different ways to earn themselves: from the commission for currency exchange to the creation of designs for the pages of registered users.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/virtual-wall-street/">+++</a> <br><br>  <b>PS</b> If you heard about interesting projects, write to us - startup@wanted.vc - and we will write about them! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/120267/">https://habr.com/ru/post/120267/</a></p>
