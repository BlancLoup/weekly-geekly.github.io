Especially in our industry, it all depends on people.  If someone doubts this, I highly recommend the book of Swedes Kjell A. Nordstrom, Jonas Ridderstrale, ‚ÄúFunky Business.  Capital is dancing to the tune of talent. ‚Äù  The book is not new, but, IMHO, very intelligibly explains why <s>Marx, Lenin and Mao Zedong were right</s> in the modern world, this is exactly so. <br><br>  And since people are capital, then it must be protected and multiplied, and not squandered.  And to remain without human capital is very simple.  Here, a set of statements that can make your best fighters think, and whether it is time to update your resume on hh.  And you will only losers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1. You do not need to know why it is needed at all.  You just have to do this crap and all. <br><br>  2. Your ratings are too high.  You do not want to strain and work effectively.  Three students will make the project twice as fast.

      3. How I will return the money invested in the project is not your business. <br><br>  4. What are the analysts?  What do you need functional specifications for?  Read the correspondence in the mail.  Everything is written there.  And in general, they themselves should think about what is required by the customer. <br><br>  5. Well, what for you project manager?  Do you have to constantly kick you?  You can't work without it? <br><br>  6. I do not need a risk analysis.  I do not need a plan to manage changes, communications, configurations and other blah, blah, blah.  I need a result. <br><br>  7. Why not without a GUI designer?  A professional programmer himself must be able to develop a high-quality interface. <br><br>  8. You do not need to communicate with users.  You should know better what they need. <br><br>  9. Why else an architect and two weeks to design?  The customer pays us not for OOP, patterns and ERD, but for functionality. <br><br>  10. To hell with coding standards.  There is also a review of the code and refactoring.  This is just no one needs the loss of time. <br><br>  11. No intermediate deliveries and ratings by users.  Fools polraboty not show. <br><br>  12. What else is a quality assurance plan and testing?  Don't you know how to write programs without errors? <br><br>  13. Why do we need these version control systems and all sorts of bug trackers?  Just fixed the error and drove on. <br><br>  14. You do not need to know all the information about the project.  Everyone just has to do his job.  The rest is my concern. <br><br>  15. Why do you need unlimited internet?  Flood on the rsdn.ru and sql.ru forums or monitor hh.ru?  There is access to selected sites that are really needed for work.  So work. <br><br>  16. Remember.  I don't want to hear anything about the problems.  Solving them is your task.  I pay you money for this. <br><br>  17. It does not matter that your team has no one with experience with this platform, and half of them have no experience in industrial development.  But we have a young and promising team. <br><br>  18. So what if we realized only half of what we were going for in the first month?  This is because Vasya got sick, Petya got married, and Vova went to hard drinking after his wedding.  Next month we will try and make up for this lag. <br><br>  19. If you do not cope with the task during working hours, then this is also your problem.  There are evenings and weekends.  And you can still learn in your free time and at your own expense, of course. <br><br>  20. ‚ÄúThat's what a wolf is in the forest so that the shepherd doesn‚Äôt sleep!‚Äù And every day you will write me a report on the work done to the nearest minutes.  And I will evaluate on it how effectively you are working. <br><br>  21. And last.  Know it.  We have no irreplaceable.  After the project, only the best will remain in the company. <br><br>  Supplement? <br><br>  Successes! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/214851/">https://habr.com/ru/post/214851/</a></p>
