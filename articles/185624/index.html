      As a hardware appliance was supposed to use <br>  - full servers with esxi - for large installations <br>  - servers with atom - for small ones. <br><br>  SUDDENLY, for the year the number of branches increased to 10, and in another one and a half - to 28. <br>  The constant stream of corporate bouts from businesses provoked the growth of traffic and the emergence of new network and application services. <br>  Some of them settled on Linux virtual routers, instead of individual servers. <br><br>  Vyatta functionality was not enough, a large number of packages affected the overall stability and performance of services. <br><br>  Also, there were a number of problems with VPN. <br>  1. At that time there were about 100 static tunnels terminated at one point. <br>  2. In the future, it was still opening 10 branches. <br><br>  In addition, openvpn in the current implementation, <br>  1. does not allow creating dynamically generated site-to-site tunnels. <br>  2. It is not multi-threaded, which on router processors with 1-2 uplink tunnels leads to overload of 1-2 cores (out of 8-16 in our case) with encryption and leads to hilarious consequences for traffic inside the tunnel. <br>  3. Clause 2 is particularly characteristic of routers whose processors lacked support for AES-NI. <br><br>  It was possible to use gre + ipsec, which would eliminate performance problems - but there would remain tunnels, hundreds of them. <br><br>  It was very sad, I wanted to overlap with warm tsiska with hardware encryption and use dmvpn. <br>  Or already global MPLS VPN. <br>  In order not to trifle. <br><br>  We had to do something (c) <br><br>  - 1-2x processor servers with a tasty amount of brain and esxi were on board at the branches <br>  - routers were decompressed and all third-party services moved to dedicated virtual machines with pure linux <br>  - after some searches, the virtualized x86 routeros was chosen as the routing platform. <br>  The operating experience of the micro-device had already been by that time, there were no problems with performance and stability on our tasks under x86. <br>  On iron solutions, especially - on RB7 ** and RB2011 ** - it was and is more fun <br><br>  Potentially, this solution gave an increase in the functional in <br>  - route redistribution <br>  - pbr + vrf <br>  - mpls <br>  - pim <br>  - qos <br>  as well as some others. <br><br>  The problem was that routeros (like vyatta) does not support multipoint vpn. <br>  It became sad again, they began to dig towards pure Linux fullmesh solutions. <br><br>  Separately, by the way, thanks to Habrawser <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/valdikss/" class="user_link">ValdikSS</a> for his <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/150151/">article</a> . <br><br>  Considered: peervpn, tinc, campagnol, GVPE, Neorouter, OpenNHRP, Cloudvpn, N2N <br>  As a result, we stopped at tincvpn, as a compromise solution. <br>  I also really liked gvpe using exotic encapsulation methods, but it didn‚Äôt allow specifying several IPs (from different ISPs) for remote peer. <br><br>  What a shame, tinc was also single-threaded. <br>  The solution was a dirty hack: <br>  1. Between every two members, the mesh is raised not by 1, but by N tunnels, which are then combined into a bond interface with outgoing traffic balancing. <br><br>  2. as a result, we obtain already N processes, which can already be distributed among different cores. <br><br>  When using the specified scheme, in lab with <br>  - 8 tinc-interfaces, aggregated into one bond according to the specified scheme <br>  - forced binding of processes to different cores <br>  - 1 x xeon 54 **, 55 ** (old generation processors without aes-ni support) <br>  - aes128 / sha1, <br>  - udp as a transport protocol. <br>  - without using qos both inside and outside the tunnel. <br><br>  The performance of vpn was about 550-600 mbps on a gigabit channel. <br>  We were saved. <br><br>  What happened: <br>  1. The final solution received the working name "vpn-pair." <br>  2. It consists of two virtual machines located on one esxi host and connected by a virtual interface. <br>  1 - routeros, which deals exclusively with routing issues <br>  2 - pure linux with a licked and slightly doped tinc. <br>  Performs the role of vpn-bridge. <br>  The tinc configuration is similar to the laboratory configuration, while the bond interface is sbrigen with a virtual link to the microtic. <br>  As a result, all routers have a common L2, you can raise ospf and enjoy. <br>  3. Each branch has 2 vpn-pairs. <br><br>  <i>... to be continued ...</i> <br><h4>  Notes </h4><br>  1. In principle, it is possible to integrate tinc into vyatta, a patch was even written about this (for the version with 1 interface) <br>  But to predict the behavior of such a bundle in an emergency (or after updating the platform) with a custom patch is completely difficult and for such a large network such experiments are undesirable. <br><br>  2. Considered also the option "matryoshka". <br>  He had 2 directions: <br>  - purchase of hardware x86 microtics and support for linux-vm with a vpn-bridge using built-in virtualization (KVM). <br>  did not take off due to poor performance. <br><br>  - nested virtualization (esxi -&gt; routeros -&gt; kvm -&gt; linux). <br>  did not take off for the same reasons, due to the lack of support for VT-X / EPT emulation in esxi 5.1 (needed to start the kvm-machine). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/185624/">https://habr.com/ru/post/185624/</a></p>
