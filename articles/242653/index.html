      You can create a very attractive resume.  And try to impress the employer in all sorts of ways. <br><br>  Or maybe just be sincere?  I will share my experience. <br><a name="habracut"></a>  It all began, of course, with the search for vacancies and responses to them.  Found several companies in which I would like to work.  It is understood that the vacancies of these companies indicate a set of skills, half of which I do not have.  And also indicates the level of the starting salary, which I, as a junior, can not claim.  He began to look for other firms with smaller zp.  and requirements. <br><br>  But suddenly I stumbled upon a company in which I really would like to work.  I liked very much what they do.  Let's call it web.ru to keep it confidential.  And again - I do not have such a set of skills, the level of starting ZP.  very large for junior.  I decided this way - and what, actually, will be lost if I try to respond to a vacancy? <br><br>  Call back from web.ru.  The preliminary interview by phone begins.  Questions of a general nature.  At the end of the conversation are invited to an in-person interview.  And then I say to the personnel officer: ‚Äúyou know, I understand that the level of my knowledge does not correspond to the Z.P., which you offer.‚Äù  And I call that zp  to which I appreciated myself.  It is 2 times lower than stated.  I answer: ‚Äúwell, this option can also be considered.  Come". <br><br>  And here it is, the interview.  Give the test task.  I can‚Äôt answer some of the questions (little experience).  I give a piece, wait.  Already a little bit resigned to the fact that the interview can not pass because of this test.  And here the leader returns to the negotiation room, and not the personnel officer.  With my tests.  The next stage of the interview begins. <br><br>  To the questions, why didn‚Äôt I solve this or this task, I answer quite sincerely: ‚ÄúA little experience‚Äù.  Ask additional questions.  To the part I answer, to the part from them - no.  I sincerely motivate ‚ÄúNot enough experience, I didn‚Äôt have to do this, I wasn‚Äôt interested in these issues.‚Äù I‚Äôll say that I didn‚Äôt even try to ‚Äúinvent something, suddenly guess / go for the truth‚Äù, didn‚Äôt even think to exaggerate my experience or hang myself some regalia.  Not trying to "get out of difficult issues."  Instead of ‚Äútwisting‚Äù, I said everything I know.  I understood that this was not enough - he commented on his answers: ‚ÄúThis is all I know for now.‚Äù <br><br>  Only sincerity, only truth. <br><br>  And of course, showed his sincere desire to quickly move forward and develop in the new profession.  So lucky I really liked her. <br><br>  <b>The result:</b> "Given that you sincerely assess yourself and your level, we will give you the opportunity." <br><br>  As a result, I still work at web.ru. <br>  The fact that leadership values ‚Äã‚Äãsincerity is manifested everywhere.  It is pleasant and productive to work, a powerful team, a well-coordinated team, everyone works well and conscientiously.  Because of all this, it was possible to very quickly develop skills in a new profession.  And those who are insincere, trying to deceive, wag and throw their work on others, do not stay long at web.ru.  Do not stand up.  All their tricks are visible.  And very well visible. <br><br>  <b>The bottom line:</b> wagging and exaggerating is one extreme.  Being completely sincere is another.  Between them - something in between.  You understand what the average is.  Usually like this, "medium" and pass interviews.  Maybe try to be absolutely sincere?  Suddenly you end up in a team where it is very much appreciated?  And you will work and develop with very honest, and from this diligent and careful people in their work. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/242653/">https://habr.com/ru/post/242653/</a></p>
