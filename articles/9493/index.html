  <section class="page js-page"><h1>SaaS is the Internet plus the globalization of IT services.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>And they (the West) in the yard SaaS, and we (Russia, Ukraine) in this field and the horse did not roll.</i>  <i>Some facts, figures and references on the state and prospects of software-as-a-service development, as well as how it will all affect outsourcing and other areas of IT - activities ... with a sad conclusion at the end.</i> <br><br>  <b>And they have SaaS in the yard.</b>  In the year since I began to study software-as-service problems (Software-as-a-Service), dramatic changes have occurred in this area.  If at the beginning of the period under review there were no fewer skeptics than violent supporters of programs providing their services via the Internet, now all those who have doubts have, in practice, become silent.  In many notes of my blog (both specially dedicated to SaaS, and monthly reviews) I have already noted that this direction is gaining more and more new positions along the vertical and horizontal lines of the industrial spectrum.  Opportunities for SaaS came in the way, both large corporations and in the niche of small and medium businesses.  In the same place I cited or referred to various facts and figures.  Of the new figures, the reader may be interested in those listed in Information Week. <br><br>  If we talk about the facts, the Software 2007 conference held in May of this year was very significant here. The topic of global outsourcing, which has dominated recent years at this annual forum, clearly gave way to SaaS.  In the news feed Google, for example, a few dozens of new messages appear every day, mostly press releases.  The latter testifies that the time for general conversations has ended, concrete business has begun.  A significant role in the attention span of the IT public was also played by the active ‚Äúgestures‚Äù of Microsoft towards SaaS.  The market for business consolidation (M &amp; A) also reacted: the demand for SaaS providers has increased dramatically.

      As always, with the active invasion of some new direction on the already established and clearly segmented market, it was not without the "dizzy with success."  Over-optimists have appeared, predicting that SaaS, in general, will push out the old software from the market (premise) and will completely push software development outsourcing into the shadows.  By the way, it seems that thanks to such optimists, the habit has recently become ingrained to consider software-as-a-service and custom software (software on-demand) synonymous, although in fact SaaS is only one of the options for the latter. <br><br>  No matter how it was, the <b><i>fact that SaaS already has and still will have a significant impact on IT services and on outsourcing is no longer in doubt.</i></b>  To begin with, as I have already said, SaaS, by itself, is nothing more than outsourcing.  In this case, outsourcing IT services.  No wonder the first SaaS model is often called Application Service Outsourcing. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  However, if the usual outsourcing of services was geographically rather localized, then the host country of the SaaS provider may be located far away from the customer.  In other words, SaaS is the prospect of the globalization of the outsourcing of IT services, and more so than when software development is offshoring.  They still need closer interaction between the parties, which, in particular, with a large difference in time zones sometimes turns into a serious problem. <br><br>  Further, of course, the advent of SaaS will reduce the need to develop custom software products.  This means that the need for outsourcing design work (R &amp; D outsourcing) in areas related to programming will also decrease. <br><br>  As for IT services, the impact on SaaS is far from being limited to the specifics of outsourcing.  The very structure of these services is changing: there is a further reduction in the scope of work on system integration, the weight and features of work related to reengineering and maintenance are reduced, the role of consulting, etc., is increasing.  This should greatly affect the activities of the internal divisions of many companies and IT service providers.  So, everyone will have to rebuild.  And the sooner the better. <br><br>  <b>And at our SaaS ‚Äì niva and the horse did not roll.</b>  Indeed, I can not but surprise, I would say, the sleepy state of Russian IT (as well as Ukrainian, by the way) with respect to SaaS, in general, and to future changes in the nature of outsourcing and IT services, in particular.  Although it would seem here, and cards in hand.  You can start with an almost clean slate.  However, judge for yourself ... <br><br>  I recently read a fresh and quite interesting overview of the state and prospects (!) Of the development of IT services in Russia.  The article in Cnews is called ‚ÄúThe Russian IT services market: trends and prospects‚Äù.  Everything is there: classification, drawings, graphics, expert opinions, analytics.  <b><i>There is only one thing - direct or indirect mention of SaaS.</i></b>  So, as I see it, there are no such very prospects. <br><br>  <i>Other considerations and arguments of the author in defense of his position, as well as some conclusions, as well as the necessary links can be found in the extended version of this note posted on the iTech Bridge blog (http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php?showtopic = 19391)</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/9493/">https://habr.com/ru/post/9493/</a></p>
