Pshik and farting into the void, but I will express my opinion, which for some reason is considered by many to be "abnormal." <br><br>  Let's define it right away.  I am a programmer and my job is, in essence, to create some kind of non-material product.  Product that is considered copyright.  I get paid for my work.  I repeat.  I get paid for my work.  Chew.  I work, I create with my brain some intangible product and they pay me for it.  That's it, finished repeating. <br><br>  I can not only create a certain software product to order, but also make it at my whim and sell as a commodity at least a hundred million times, requesting the amount I consider necessary. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A little distracted.  I worked on my first product for a month and sold it to 3m people, you will laugh, 600 rubles.  A month later, the entire mobile Internet was littered with services built on the basis of my product.  It's simple - one of the buyers sold the product to another, he began to distribute it cheaper, and one of those who bought it for a penny, laid out the product on the vareznik.  My little business has covered itself.  No one bought my product.  And it was at this moment that I changed my attitude to the products of copyright.  It was at the moment when my product of my work was stolen, it became the moment when I realized that all that pirated software with which my computer was stuffed, all those movies and music that were merged from torrents and recorded into discs - theft of someone then labor.

      It was when a product that I made with my own hands was stolen from me that I realized that I had to either pay for someone else's work, or not use this labor. <br><br>  So, I want to be paid.  And I get paid as much as I want.  If I want to pay less, then I stand on my own and as a result, I either get what I want and sell my work, or I don‚Äôt work and get nothing.  I am completely satisfied with this situation. <br><br>  So how is it that my work differs from the work of my favorite group, the director, from the next exorcism of Bilan and Comedy Club Production?  Nothing. <br>  I get paid for my work and pay for someone else, or do not use it. <br><br>  I do not want to pay for the album of the group and I do not listen to it. <br>  I do not want to pay for the game and I do not play it. <br>  I do not want to pay for% subject% and I do not have this same% subject%. <br><br>  So, why do I get paid for my work, and I do not have to pay for someone else? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/119184/">https://habr.com/ru/post/119184/</a></p>
