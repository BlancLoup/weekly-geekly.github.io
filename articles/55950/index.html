  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Synergy to parents and teachers!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today, the first-grader girl brought from school two copies of a certain contract that ‚Äúmust‚Äù be filled out.  Began to read.  It turned out that these papers were handed over to parents by an elementary school, which collaborates with the project School ‚ÄúSynergy‚Äù. <br><br>  The essence of the project is to create a centralized system for effective communication between parents of primary school students and teachers.  Initially, Synergy-Info (which, by the way, collaborates with the Min. Of Education in Moscow :) concludes an agreement with the school and for providing its services (registering an educational institution (teachers and mentioned primary classes attached to them)) requires 36,000 rubles a year. <br><br>  It is interesting to note that from January 1, 2007, the school has the opportunity to pay these 36,000 rubles from the budget of an educational institution.  However, the contract between the school and the parents provides for an annual ‚Äúmonthly fee‚Äù in the amount of a kilo-ship from each family.  The question is, if this program is paid from the state.  budget, why does the school need this money, which, by the way, will obviously be more than 36 thousand :)?  In the "Questions and Answers" section of the Synergy website there are such words on this score: "The school has other expenses: equipment for the teacher‚Äôs workplace, supplement to the teacher."

      I don‚Äôt know how about other Moscow schools, but the one where the child is learning has been well-equipped with computers for a long time, and primary school teachers anyway communicate with their parents anyway.  Does it seem to you in this connection that this whole undertaking is aimed primarily at making the company and the school of money, and only then at building bridges between parents and teachers? <br><br>  It is also funny, by the way, that the officials at every opportunity reminded (it‚Äôs true lately, they stopped) about the desire of schools to go to the openers (which, of course, does not always imply free of charge, but still) and all that stuff, but in fact it turns out. <br><br>  Immediately I wanted to raise a similar project, but free, but the question arose of how to attract schools there ... There is no way to do without the Ministry of Education (sad smile). <br><br>  Who else knows anything about the Synergy School project? <br><br>  <b>UPD: the</b> parents of many classmates of the girl, apparently, were fascinated by the ‚Äúinnovative approach to learning‚Äù and are going to pay for this business.  The situation is more curious and curious ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/55950/">https://habr.com/ru/post/55950/</a></p>
