  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Search engine hot tours FAN TRIP</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Traveling is not always expensive, and many people know this from personal experience.  There are different ways to save, but one of the most popular now - if you are not ready to sacrifice service, traveling by ‚Äúsavage‚Äù or speed, setting off on a journey by car - is the so-called ‚Äútrip chip‚Äù (from cheap trip - ‚Äúinexpensive trip‚Äù) .  Even the best resorts are seldom filled all year round: a serious stream of visitors falls on holidays and the holiday season, while the rest of the time there are many unoccupied places in hotels.  During this period, the rooms are rented with significant discounts, and travel agencies do not miss the opportunity to provide their customers with "hot" trips at greatly reduced prices.  Of course, this does not affect the quality of the proposed service.  Rest on such vouchers is called a chip trip.  The specificity of such tours are limited terms, but the closer the departure date, the cheaper the voucher will cost, so the customer always remains the winner. <br><br><h4>  Travelers' club </h4><br>  Launched just the other day, in early August, the <a href="http://fantrip.ru/">FAN TRIP</a> project is an aggregator of cheap vouchers.  The scheme of the project is simple: you find an interesting option for yourself, buy a tour package and go on a trip.  However, the creators of the project want to go beyond the online travel store, and position themselves as a club of fans of cheap tours, in which a whole infrastructure is built around the actual search and sale of vouchers: the ability to search for travel companions, an affiliate program, offline club events, a cumulative and bonus system. <br><br> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/78164/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/b34d8b3e/43889c5b/08a943b0/a0dde3d6.jpg"></a> <br>  <i>Rest - he is actually near, only hand stretch</i>

    <a name="habracut"></a><h4>  Chiptrip history </h4><br>  The first site specialized in providing such services was <a href="http://www.lastminute.com/">lastminute.com</a> , founded in 1998.  Today, it remains the largest chip trip operator, selling more than 800,000 air tickets per year.  The <a href="http://www.lastminute.com/">lastminute.com</a> service has offices in almost all countries of the world and is available to residents of CIS countries. <br><br>  However, in the Russian market, the chip tripy also did not go unnoticed.  In 2004, the LiveJournal community dedicated to hot vouchers grew into a tour agency <a href="http://www.cheaptrip.ru/">Cheaptrip</a> .  Following it, services such as <a href="http://obnovlenie.ru/">Upgrade</a> and <a href="http://tourstanok.ru/">Turstanok</a> opened. <br><br> <a href="http://fantrip.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f57/3f1/0ef/f573f10ef9cfd7e49a2b57aa65679e73.jpg" alt="image" align="left"></a> <br>  The design of the portal in the best traditions of modern startups is quite ‚Äúairy‚Äù and ‚Äúwebdwanolen‚Äù, but not without oddities - for example, most of the main page of <a href="http://fantrip.ru/">fantrip.ru</a> is occupied by a large, but not very functional promo block that offers to register, duplicating the actual link to the registration at the top right , and talks about the main features of the project - the very selection of tours, the upcoming opportunity to find companions and discounts on tours.  This is just a description, without hyperlinks, so you can safely skip it - the block is closed, and the look of the site immediately takes a more functional look. <br><br>  Now on the title page of the site, immediately below the logo, we see a table with a list of ‚Äúhot‚Äù tours.  This is very convenient: we don‚Äôt have to go through the extra links to use the main functionality of the site. <br><br> <a href="http://fantrip.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a4/6c4/66e/3a46c466e71709660b6a5d6886be620f.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  The table contains basic information about the tours: destination, departure date, the name of the hotel with the number of stars, as well as the price in dollars and rubles.  On top are filters that allow you to select a country, length of stay, date of departure, price frames, as well as ‚Äúreject‚Äù star hotels.  In the right corner, just below the filters, there is a switch between the ‚Äúfull‚Äù and ‚Äúeconomical‚Äù version of the table interface: it allows you to remove photos of hotels. <br><br><h4>  How it works </h4><br>  Since the main profile of the project is still an aggregator of burning tours, it is not only quality but also quantity that is important here.  <a href="http://fantrip.ru/">FAN TRIP</a> uses the base of <a href="http://wwt.su/">wwt.su</a> vouchers, processing 80% of the offers from all operators from the operators to the main resorts of the world. <br><br>  So, for example, I want to spend a week abroad in a five star hotel, but I am not ready to pay more than $ 500 per person.  By setting the appropriate settings, we choose the option that is most attractive for us, and ... <br><br> <a href="http://fantrip.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/3a791937/332c40ab/08c9230a/05da9865.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  ... by clicking on the tour name, go to the details screen.  So far, it is, alas, not much different from the table.  Here we can find out the minimum number of travelers for this tour, get detailed information about how and where to get your tour package.  It would be nice to subsequently see more detailed information about hotels and places to go. <br><br>  The ‚ÄúOrder Tour‚Äù button is also located here.  Clicking on it will display a special form, filling in which, you will carry out the order of the permit.  The tour package, which includes tickets and confirmation of reservation at the hotel, will be waiting for you already at the <a href="http://fantrip.ru/site/page%3Fpage%3Dcontacts">Moscow office of FanTrip</a> at metro station Taganskaya, <a href="http://maps.yandex.ru/-/CBaAZImh">Verkhnyaya Radishchevskaya, 7, bld.1</a> .  The office is still the only one, although, as I understand it, there are plans to open new representative offices - but so far only in Moscow. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/a06bd385/8dd93842/c83d4bef/7745344a.png" alt="image"><br><br><blockquote>  Tour packages usually include: accommodation, flight, transfer. <br>  Fuel surcharge, visa, medical insurance are paid separately. </blockquote><br><br>  Together with the tour package you are promised to demonstrate the charm of the club project at the level of service: a cup of coffee is a minimum for a dear guest, because you are now a member of the club. <br><br>  It is possible to book a tour without registration, but authorized users receive discounts and can participate in the accumulation of points, which can later be spent, for example, on gifts in a cozy club shop. <br><br>  Authorization on the site is done on modern templates: to enter, you can use the data of your mailbox or page in the social service.  The site authorizes clients of Google, Yandex, Rambler, Mail.ru, Yahoo, VKontakte, Facebook, Twitter, LiveJournal (a place for Habr so far, alas, was not found). <br><br> <a href="http://fantrip.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/0f4267b7/ef817ccc/284e428b/d6c1d938.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br><h4>  Sign up for tours </h4><br>  The second important "feature" of the site is tripping: a subscription to hot tours.  A successful chiptrip is to grab onto the advantageous ticket in time.  For this, club members can subscribe to receive up-to-date information about the tours they are interested in.  The subscription button is located directly below the entrance to your personal account. <br><br> <a href="http://fantrip.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/f1622ec2/a326879c/1eb5fb58/fed42e58.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  In the subscription form, you can specify which tour you are interested in and how you would like to be notified (email notifications and via Twitter are available). <br><br>  <a href="http://fantrip.ru/">FAN TRIP</a> is planning enhanced interaction with social services.  Now it is limited to links to service offices on Twitter, Contact and Facebook, but in the near future we are promised to introduce a search function for travel companions among club members. <br><br><h4>  Experience exchange </h4><br>  Since <a href="http://fantrip.ru/">FAN TRIP</a> is not just a sale of vouchers, but a full-fledged club, communication between its members is not limited to online.  The company's development plan includes regular meetings in a cozy place <a href="http://www.cafe-travel.ru/">Travel Caf√©</a> , where experienced travelers will present their trips, and beginners will be able to ask questions and hear useful recommendations from travel industry professionals. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/f5db218e/7a4e3bec/4252b5d3/68535ebd.png"><br><br>  Announcements of meetings will be announced in the online representations and in the future section of the ‚ÄúPlaybill‚Äù site. <br><br><h4>  Instead of epilogue </h4><br>  So who needs ‚Äúanother chiptrip project‚Äù?  Yes, perhaps, anyone who can afford podgadat vacation time or holidays at an interesting discount - or just break, for example, for a week in Turkey in a 4 * hotel together for 16 thousand with a flight.  Even the work of full-time is not an insurmountable obstacle, if there is a desire.  The opportunity to spontaneously arrange a small holiday for yourself is priceless. <br><ul><li> Thanks to the subscription system from your personal account, you will learn about offers that are interesting for you as soon as they appear. </li><li>  And with the help of scoring and affiliate programs, for every hundred dollars spent on the purchase of tours, you have a club discount. </li><li>  An affiliate program means that the participant receives a portion of the commission from the tours acquired by the users invited by him.  Enough to attract several new customers, and your own purchases will be cheaper by thousands of rubles.  Remember this old ad - ‚Äú <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D4cJYjFOv71Q">I sell friends</a> ‚Äù?  ;) </li><li>  And, of course, offline events in Travel Caf√© to consolidate the club atmosphere - what a club without meetings? </li></ul><br>  The traveler will definitely not be left behind - the more such projects in runet, the better, and the more chances to go on an excellent trip for reasonable money.  In the end, nothing prevents you from simply subscribing to the necessary tours and waiting for when an offer appears among them that you cannot refuse. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/78164/">https://habr.com/ru/post/78164/</a></p>
