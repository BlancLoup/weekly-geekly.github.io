  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Electronic cards for citizens of the Russian Federation</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Last weekend, unexpectedly, an invitation was received from the organizers of the meeting of the top bloggers of Runet, representatives of the media and the IT community with the developers of the Universal Electronic Card.  They asked to invite the leading authors to Habr√©.  I did not experience any expectations, it was, frankly, not a hunt.  After much deliberation, I decided to take some benefit and agree to a meeting, because  finally, there was a reason to talk with the habraws, and to show oneself, it was also tempting to look at others. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I sent out offers to many of the first numbers of our rating, I will not give names, for honor of privacy.  As a result, only Sergey Abdulmanov aka <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/Milfgard/">Milfgard</a> decided to come.  Given my genuine interest in his personality, this fact was very pleased. <br><br>  On Tuesday, the 29th, he moved to the gathering place, drove quietly to the dynamo, then, having stood in a traffic jam and was late for 10 minutes, he was allowed to meet a female individual in the hall, where everything happened. <br><br>  They planted next to Sergei, for which a special thank you.

      In general, I will not talk a lot about the event, everything is with Milfgard, who led the online broadcast.  you can read <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/e_gov/133602/">here</a> . <br><br>  After the event, I can say the following: <br><br>  1. They invited me honestly, did not ask to observe any appearances, did not give lists of questions prepared in advance; <br>  2. I agreed with Sergey that this is a good trend when they start inviting specialists who really understand the essence of the matter and can ask specific questions; <br>  3. I liked the head of the development of the project UEC, an intelligent guy, answered well, sorry, there is no video recording, because  it was really interesting; <br>  4. The project is interesting, useful.  Anyone who advocates for personal data, I do not see anything wrong with all the documents brought together in one card.  We all leave a bunch of personal data and information on the network, the dossier to the authorities is on us and so it is.  There is a question of illegal access to these data by officials, but it is rather to the authorities, and not to the developers. <br>  5. Regarding hacking, everything can be hacked, there would be a desire and possibilities, but the ability to use this data should be stopped at the level of the law. <br>  6. Anyone who writes about anti-Christianity, diabolical technology, people management, etc.  Since the time of the fall of Rome, mankind has embarked on a completely different path of development, spirituality has replaced technology, universal maps are a stage of technological development, a stage inevitable until humanity goes along this path of its development.  The church, however, is not much different from the state, and maybe even worse, because  it controls and guides people through suggestion and a change in consciousness when electronics only optimizes processes.  In this case, we can say that because of the changed consciousness of the church there were hundreds of warriors, murders and acts of violence, while electronic cards have not yet killed a single person. <br>  7. Off-top, was a good buffet, notable snack =) <br>  8. Once again, I realized that it was necessary that only those people who understood their business should communicate with people on all projects, and not pustobol managers. <br>  9. Once again, I was convinced of the correctness of my point of view, when all professional communities, for example, like Habra, should participate in press conferences, discuss projects and give their assessments, maybe in this way we will be able to help in the implementation of large projects, of course not only on a free basis, but also on donations or on a fee basis. <br>  10. I liked the project, make intelligent people, but there are doubts about the possibility of its implementation in Russia.  The creation of infrastructure may simply be bogged down with corruption, illiteracy, and the reluctance of many companies and organizations to introduce something new; they have been passing more than once until I see anything that could suggest otherwise. <br><br>  Photos from the scene: <br>  1. We are with Sergey, Habra-command <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/187e7636/0d0fafee/0fa7c9bf/93e13bdc.jpg"><br>  2.
