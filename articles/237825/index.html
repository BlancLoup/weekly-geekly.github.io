    <a name="habracut"></a>  ‚ÄúCustomers need solutions that meet application requirements, take into account budget constraints, and provide an increased level of protection against cyber threats to enterprise infrastructure,‚Äù said Adalio Sanchez, CEO of IBM x86 and Power Systems Solutions.  ‚ÄúThe new M5 servers are built with IBM‚Äôs innovative legacy to fully support enterprise applications and provide customers with the required level of security, efficiency and reliability.‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Portfolio M5 includes:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e0f/f1d/51e/e0ff1d51e85145338680f19e9ef35e6b.jpg"><br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>System x3650 M5</b> - a powerful and multifunctional two-socket rack server in a 2U form factor that can be optimized for working with big data, analytics tools and cloud computing; <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>System x3550 M5</b> - a universal two-socket rack server in the 1U form factor, which is suitable for working with a wide range of workloads in various business areas; <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>System x3500 M5</b> is a high-performance dual-rack rack or tower server of the ‚Äúall-in-one‚Äù format in the 5U form factor, designed specifically for work with critical loads; <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/280/dd9/01b/280dd901b96940c0a91a610c521ace6e.jpg"><br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Flex System x240 M5</b> - server optimized for virtualization tasks and enterprise application support; <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>NeXtScale nx360 M5</b> is a half-width computing server in the 1U form factor, featuring high rack density, design flexibility, and performance; <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b6b/295/f41/b6b295f4120d4fab8a5770b704a843a6.jpg"><br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>NeXtScale System with Water Cool Technology</b> - a water-cooled server optimized for energy efficient operation at low cost solutions. <br>  ‚ÄúConsidering the realities of the day, as loads grow and resources decrease, customers need the highest possible level of reliability, efficiency, and automation,‚Äù said Bill Parker, customer manager at Logicalis, an IBM business partner.  ‚ÄúWe can't wait to share with customers the capabilities that the new IBM systems have.‚Äù <br><br>  The new M5 servers use the latest technologies, including Intel Xeon E5-2600 v3 processors, as well as high-speed and energy-efficient DDR4 memory modules with a total volume of up to 1.5 terabytes. <br><br>  New servers will be available for order as soon as possible, except for the x240 M5 and NeXtScale with Water Cool Technology, which will go on sale later this year.  The x3500 M5 server will go on sale in the first quarter of 2015. <br><br>  To help its customers translate corporate workloads to the cloud and improve overall efficiency, reliability, and performance of enterprise infrastructure, IBM also introduces new solutions, including: <br><br><ul><li>  IBM System x Solution for VMware VSAN is a software-defined data storage solution that provides users of the new System x M5 and VMware Virtual SAN servers with simplified VM storage management.  The solution will help reduce the total cost of ownership, and at the same time provide high performance and reliable data storage for virtual machines; </li><li>  The IBM System Solution for Fast Track for SQL Server 2014 is a solution that is based on efficient M5 technologies for workloads associated with data storage using SQL Server 2014. The solution maximizes application uptime and provides unmatched scalability while increasing workloads. ; </li><li>  IBM SmartCloud Desktop Infrastructure with Atlantis Computing ILIO - a solution that helps to reduce storage costs, as well as improve the ergonomics of the infrastructure when organizing virtual desktops using Citrix XenDesktop or VMware Horizon View; </li><li>  IBM Flex System Solutions for Microsoft Hyper-V is a cloud-based infrastructure solution based on IBM Flex System, Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2, Hyper-V hardware-based virtualization system and System Center 2012 R2, which helps reduce operating costs, improve system reliability and performance for perform a wide range of tasks. </li></ul><br><br><h3>  Security: </h3><br><br>  All new M5 servers have industry-leading security features organized with Trusted Platform Assurance ‚Äî an exclusive set of security functions and practices for System x designed to protect information systems from malware.  All new servers go through a process of secure development and performance testing.  In addition, all microcodes are created in such a way as to fully comply with the new equipment: using the system of electronic signatures and verification mechanisms during installation and updating. <br><br>  The M5 servers use the latest version of the Trusted Platform Module (TPM 2.0), which uses more encryption algorithms and supports more Windows OS features.  The new feature Secure Firmware Rollback prohibits the installation of any unauthorized versions of north microcodes. <br>  New servers also offer additional enterprise-class data protection tools, such as hard drives with encryption support (can be purchased separately) and centralized security key management tools using IBM Security Key Lifecycle Management. <br><br><h3>  Efficiency </h3><br><br>  The new M5 servers are based on IBM's many years of experience in enhancing solution efficiency and managing data centers.  With built-in features for power and temperature control, M5 systems can significantly reduce plant energy costs compared to previous generations of x86 systems.  These functions include the expansion of the temperature range, the allocation of zones of double cooling and the transfer of energy sources into active / sleep mode. <br><br>  For example, the NeXtScale System with Water Cooling technology provides up to 40% more efficient data center operation in comparison with a similar solution with integrated air cooling system (1). <br><br>  Moreover, the M5 servers showed improved performance over the previous generation of x86 systems, reaching 131 percent (2) when working with typical Java-based workloads, up to 61 percent (3) when working with virtualization tasks, and up to 59 percent (4) when working with databases. <br><br><h3>  Reliability </h3><br><br>  The hardware of the System x servers is distinguished by maximum availability from the entire x86 portfolio and is the most popular among customers (5).  With the new M5 servers, IBM is strengthening its leadership position in the production of x86 systems. <br><br>  Each of the new servers offers proactive diagnostic tools to provide prompt service and reduce maintenance costs.  For example, the Next Generation Light Path Diagnostic Panel provides detailed information about the system‚Äôs operation and its malfunctioning by displaying current messages on the display.  All servers support redundancy and replacement of components "on hot" in order to minimize system downtime. <br><br>  The IBM hardware division offers customers a comprehensive portfolio that includes the <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/ru/x/">IBM System x</a> rack and tower servers, <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/ru/bladecenter/">BladeCenter</a> , <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/ru/x/nextscale/">NeXtScale</a> , <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/ru/pureflex/pureflex_overview.html">PureFlex</a> , <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/ru/networking/">System Networking</a> , <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/ru/power/">Power Systems</a> , <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/ru/z/">System z servers</a> , and <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/ru/storage/">IBM Storage</a> systems. <br><br>  <i>1.
