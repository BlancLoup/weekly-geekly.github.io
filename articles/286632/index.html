      But not only in money is happiness: young companies gather around themselves devotees and interested people who are ready to become their customers. <br><br><h4>  2. SAMSUNG </h4><br>  <b>For learning from their mistakes.</b> <br><br>  Samsung began to play Apple in the sale of smartphones, and <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/8246/">Xiaomi is</a> already behind it.  Of course, Samsung still has many trump cards up its sleeve: the company is developing connected devices for the body and for the home, sending messages refrigerators, smart dishwashers, and robot vacuum cleaners controlled from a Galaxy Note or iPhone watch. <br><br>  And what about smartphones - this year Samsung will <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/241714/">cut the line of 56 smartphone models by a third</a> . <br><br><h4>  3. SPARK </h4><br>  <b>For the rapid development of the Internet of things.</b> <br><br>  Updating a website or application is much easier than doing something with physical equipment ‚Äî for example, with home wiring and devices.  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/246430/">Spark helps</a> : the device offers a cloud platform and Arduino compatible boards with Wi-Fi or mobile Internet.  Sensors, controllers and other equipment can be connected without a soldering iron, and the cloud allows you to program, create applications and interfaces remotely. <br><br>  In July 2014, Spark shipped over 30,000 devices after receiving <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sparkdevices/spark-core-wi-fi-for-everything-arduino-compatible">$ 500,000 on Kickstarter</a> in 2013.  On the basis of the device they made a smart controller for watering the lawn <a href="https://lono.io/">Lono</a> and a game console for dogs <a href="http://getcleverpet.com/">CleverPet</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/d5e/68a/32d/d5e68a32dd2da846c91161183497a994.jpg" width="300" align="right" alt="image"><h4>  4. IFTTT </h4><br>  <b>For the simple automation of the Internet of things.</b> <br><br>  IFTTT has won the hearts of the geek community by offering simple recipes for interaction between services.  For example, if someone posted a photo on Facebook and tagged you on it, the image can automatically be saved to Dropbox. <br><br>  And this can be used for the Internet of things - for example, automatically sharing records with fitness trackers or setting up a device for feeding fish in an aquarium. <br><br><h4>  5. TRANSPORT FOR LONDON </h4><br>  <b>For the fact that the world's first subway leads to the 21st century.</b> <br><br>  The London Underground operates and is under construction for over 150 years.  Transport for London seeks to reduce the gap between the legacy of the Victorian era and the latest technology, the company works with Telent, CGI and Microsoft, so that the sensors in the subway can track all problems in real time and monitor everything, including archaic unconnected devices.  This upgrade will reduce the cost of maintaining the transport system. <br><br><h4>  6. MICROSOFT </h4><br>  <b>For opening Windows to the Internet of things.</b> <br><br>  Microsoft announced in 2014 a free license for Windows for devices with a display diagonal less than 9 inches, <a href="http://www.mstalk.ru/microsoft/11-microsoft-i-american-family-insurance-zapuskayut-startap-akselerator-po-domashney-avtomatizacii.html">launched an</a> accelerator for startups working on home automation.  The company is promoting the Azure cloud platform to process data from connected devices and an Intel Galileo scheme for the Internet of things. <br><br>  Microsoft is working with partners and trying to use its technology in a variety of devices, including elevators who know when to service them and emergency response systems in New Orleans. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/086/bc5/13c/086bc513c991c8fcbdd075b8741d7e70.jpg" width="300" align="right" alt="image"><h4>  7. QUIRKY </h4><br>  <b>For building a single platform for the Internet of things.</b> <br><br>  Buying a new connected device involves installing the application and exploring the interface.  Quirky's food incubator invites inventors to share ideas and selects the best to help them get to the market.  So it was with the platform Wink, built in partnership with GE. <br><br>  Wink allows users to control a variety of connected devices ‚Äî lights, surveillance cameras, thermostats, and other gadgets using Android and iOS apps.  Now, using the command ‚ÄúOk, Google‚Äù, you can turn on the oven, close the front door or check the light in the room. <br><br><h4>  8. NEST LABS </h4><br>  <b>For combining Nest and Android with a lot of everyday products.</b> <br><br>  The new division of Google <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/210134/">Nest</a> went beyond thermostats and smoke detectors after acquiring the manufacturer of Wi-Fi cameras Dropcam and announcing the program "Work with Nest".  Now the smart car can call home and force the Nest thermostat to raise the temperature in the apartment, because the owner is already close. <br><br><h4>  9. TESLA MOTORS </h4><br>  <b>For the Internet of things on wheels.</b> <br><br>  Tesla is not only a stylish design, electric motors and charisma Ilona Mask.  In 2014, the company signed a contract with the AT &amp; T operator to provide wireless connectivity for cars for many years to come.  This allows you to carry out remote diagnostics, update maps and, of course, entertain drivers and passengers with music on the radio, as well as help the owner to find the car in the parking lot, signaling to them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/cca/262/9a7/cca2629a766d481046077263f482208c.gif" width="300" align="right" alt="image"><h4>  10. SALESFORCE </h4><br>  <b>For the Internet of things in the workplace.</b> <br><br>  Salesforce is doing everything possible to get its customers to use the Internet of things.  Salesforce Wear allows corporate customers to use the full capabilities of wearable electronics. <br><br>  Myo bracelets allow surgeons to order x-rays with a gesture so as not to wash their hands once more, pipeline inspectors take photos with voice notes on Google Glass, and guests of hotels authenticate with a bracelet.  All this thanks to the Salesforce corporate cloud. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/286632/">https://habr.com/ru/post/286632/</a></p>
