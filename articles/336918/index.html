This time I included almost all the notes that I usually do in the course of lectures - I got the longest of the reports.  Notes from visits to Moving Brands, Microsoft Lift, Territory, Deliveroo, Moo, Made by Many, NomNom, Monese, Analog Folk, Firedrop, and Andrea Picchi. <br><br> <a href="http://www.jvetrau.com/fla-2017/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cee/205/7c9/cee2057c9cb21235ca4fd7157b9d5887.jpg" alt="Future London Academy 2017 course on &amp; nbsp; UX and &amp; nbsp; Product Design" width="780" height="410"></a> <br><br>  To sum up the main impressions of this year, I would highlight this: <br><ul><li>  Making complicated is simple is not an easy task, but you can choose a clear segment of users and their problem, which will help launch a simple version of the product.  This was told by the creators of Microsoft Paint 3D (hard filter functionality, simplifying interaction with the interface) and Firedrop (focus on one-page promotional sites). </li><li>  A ‚Äúhybrid‚Äù designer combining several related skills is important not only in product companies: UX-agencies (Made by Many), less familiar design studios (Territory), and experimental products (Microsoft) came to this point. </li><li>  Interesting offices: Microsoft Lift Studios (a mixture of the usual working space and a loft), Made by Many (a chic look and an unusual re-equipment of an industrial facility), Analog Folk (several interesting floors), Moo (they managed to create a huge hangar and improve it). </li><li>  Design sprints call any variation on the subject of this methodology, which does not necessarily fall into the five-day format.  However, in this case it is just a modern design process of working on a digital product that does not need to be branded. </li><li>  Successful brand binding to the interface often involves close co-design with business representatives.  This is evident both in the elegant result of Monese, and in the approach with the working sessions of Moving Brands. </li></ul><br><br>  <strong><a href="http://eepurl.com/bu61XX">Subscribe to the newsletter</a></strong> !
