  <section class="page js-page"><h1>NBC and News Corp. developed a plan to combat YouTube</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Late this week, the two largest media companies in America, NBC Universal and News Corp.  made a long-awaited important <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/23/technology/23video.html%3Fex%3D1332302400%26en%3Dcf4406c18e1ac229%26ei%3D5088%26partner%3Drssnyt%26emc%3Drss">statement</a> about their joint strategy of mastering the Internet as a promising space for doing business in the distribution of video content. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Negotiations among the management of large companies that own most of the US and world television and radio broadcasting market have long been rumored.  Giants such as Viacom, Disney, and the two already named, with the heyday of the Internet, have slowly begun to push off to the side of rapidly growing ambitious projects like YouTube.  The audience of the TV channels gradually went to the Network, on the vast expanses of which it became possible to easily find popular TV shows, films and programs of the same TV companies, only without annoying commercial inserts interrupting the show in the most interesting place. <br><br>  Of course, the publication of a copyrighted video is illegal and persecuted by copyright holders with enviable persistence.  But to cope with the multimillion army of YouTube visitors, as well as with the owners of this service, they still have not succeeded.  For some reason, perhaps from the reluctance to share profits with Google, media companies did not cooperate with YouTube and did not distribute their content through it.  Instead, they began work on their own large-scale project.

      The project, known so far only under the working title ‚ÄúCaterpillar‚Äù, will, according to preliminary information, have all the same functions as its powerful competitor: placing a custom video, a social network for connecting users to each other and the ability to play any video on a third-party site using the built-in player.  View all content, of course, will be completely free. <br><br>  But both NBC and News Corp insist that Caterpillar is not planned as a response to the YouTube threat.  No, their plans are much broader.  First of all, the emphasis will be placed on the fact that almost any show, any of the latest episodes of the ‚ÄúLost‚Äù or ‚Äú24‚Äù series can be watched completely legally.  And the mighty power of advertising, which once made the whole of America drink orange juice in the morning, will make it look unnatural to the user in any other place on the Internet. <br><br>  Media monsters will help in this agreement with AOL, Yahoo and MSN and MySpace, which will take a significant part of promotional work, allocating a place for their content.  Actually, the announcement of the new project was made immediately after the successful completion of negotiations with these companies. <br><br>  However, do not think that News and NBC deliberately bypass Google.  The press service of the Internet company confirmed that CEO of News Corp, Peter Chernin, had a telephone conversation with Eric Schmidt, however, nothing was known about its results.  If we discard the possibility that Chernin called Schmidt only to gloat and tremble, it may well be that Google will become a partner of Caterpillar in the future. <br><br>  Also, on the other hand, in the future it is possible to expand the alliance of the participating media companies on BS and Viacom, which, I remind you, is currently initiating a loud lawsuit against YouTube. <br><br>  The lack of advertisers, at work with whom all parties will earn very well, is not expected.  About a dozen very "delicious" preliminary contracts have already been concluded. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/5750/">https://habr.com/ru/post/5750/</a></p>
