Well, then in the apple itself, but still somehow <s>strangely</s> unusual) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cdb/b98/f87/cdbb98f87402bbbe6b7696cbe719daf4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At the entrance to the hall, where the whole event was to take place (the official name of which was ‚ÄúExperts Club Meeting‚Äù), there were two slender angels (by the way, also employees of the company!) Who identified the incoming, giving out magic badges. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ca8/80d/6a2/ca880d6a21180013c671ec0512d09c65.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  By the way, not many people were invited there (about 20 people), among whom are representatives of the leading "trusted" IT sites and glossy publications.  Oh yes, the mighty Habrahabr can be proud to squeeze in there as a part of as many as five people :) <br><br>  The reason for this closeness was the information provided to the public, namely, the company's roadmap for 2010, right up to Q4.  Unfortunately, I cannot provide any data, because  the data is strictly confidential ... and even with one eye I will not give a look at the pictures taken from under the table) But I declare with all confidence that there will be A LOT of a lot of interesting, innovative and promising!  ) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cac/949/729/cac94972971f9e063e8143f005bf5400.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Under the light of the projector, prominent people in the company spoke - <b>Kamil Isaev</b> (director of marketing for Intel) and <b><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/69549/">Alexey Rogachkov</a></b> (regional specialist in product introduction).  Like other participants of the event, they were in thematic outfits ...  Camille, for example, was in an elegant hat) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/823/99a/47e/82399a47e1f99683461ec73640a13c49.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  First of all, the news concerns processor technologies - faster, more powerful, less ... New models are coming up on a 32-nanometer process technology, with interesting features and capabilities.  For example, such as graphics integrated into the processor, which allows you to easily maneuver from high-definition video - I think this smart bonus will be appreciated by those who do not want to buy discrete video cards for their non-resource-intensive tasks.  Also on the way are new chipsets in the face of <b>H55</b> and <b>H57</b> . <br><br>  Many new technologies - <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/blogs/2009/10/30/turbo-boost/">TurboBoost</a> alone is <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/blogs/2009/10/30/turbo-boost/">worth</a> something!  ) Still software developers in this question did not pump up ... <br>  For the SSD in the face of SSD is the near future, and it pleases.  In this matter, Intel also prepares pleasant surprises, and for segments of the population with very different levels of wealth. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ffe/89a/3ce/ffe89a3cece98a4ab70bccd01f6adc7d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A separate item is pleased with the company's desire to ‚Äúsimplify‚Äù the situation with the names of the products - now all the vigorous activity of marketers, as well as a huge range of products and technologists, will be able to ‚Äúdigest‚Äù unless it really is an avid IT specialist.  In general ... feel free to connect to the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/">company blog</a> and be up to date!  At the very least, I will try to introduce it as soon as possible) <br><br>  Those present could ask any question on the topic of the meeting and get a detailed answer to it from a specialist.  Habr's visitors also recently received such an opportunity and many took advantage of it.  Yes, yes, I'm talking about the recent campaign " <b><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/69377/">5 weeks with Intel</a></b> ", which I spent on the site, to feel and win valuable prizes in which anyone could. <br>  Those <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/72794/">most-most</a> who could not tame their activity and curiosity, just yesterday got to this event, where they were given their well-deserved gifts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ada/864/e21/ada864e219c0d4123195f733d54b9309.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/87a/7ed/472/87a7ed472e7b93218b4abab929868bf7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Once again - great! <br><br>  In addition to the narration of the company's plans, there was an unusual thematic cultural and entertainment program and something delicious - so as not to rumble in the stomach) <br><br>  Well, without free communication with employees of the company has not done.  As it turned out, all of them are ordinary people, simple and sociable.  They constitute the face of the company (at least in Russia) and anyone can be sure that this is not some large ‚Äúclosed company‚Äù, but just the opposite - a company whose doors are always open for everyone. <br><br>  The evening definitely turned out to be very pleasant and unusual - thanks to all, it was nice to see and meet.  If someone has any suggestions - write, we will think;) <br><br>  By the way, how did this <a href="http://twitter.com/Boomburum/">twitter get here</a> ?!  ) <br><br>  <b>Successes!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/73876/">https://habr.com/ru/post/73876/</a></p>
