The new department took shape organizationally and set to work. <br><br>  After a few weeks, the management noticed that the new department was slower, did not meet the deadlines and threatened to disrupt the release.  The first thing that came to mind was probably the new analyst is not coping, we must help him!

      Since  Of all the other analysts in the company, I was the only one who was training people, and they attracted me to this good cause. <br>  The background of the problems was not yet known to me; therefore, having accepted the convictions of the leadership on faith, I set to work. <br>  Immediately I must say that already at the beginning I understood that Vadim was writing quite decent TZ, on the basis of what I had already worked with (documents from other analysts of the company, including mine), things went quickly, we polished up something, learned to better formulate the goals and limitations of the improvements and in two weeks Vadim‚Äôs documents became much better. <br>  But it did not help. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The department continued to fall behind and the management became impatient. <br><br>  Then, I decided to talk to the rest of the team, and here I was opened to the depths of hell. <br>  During one meeting with them, I learned the following: <br><br>  -Vadim does not know how to write requirements. <br>  -Vadim hard-nosed sheep, does not listen to the team. <br>  -Not able to communicate with the customer. <br>  - It seems he is hopeless as an analyst. <br><br>  Immediately after that, I spoke to Vadim, and suddenly everything became clear. <br>  The problem lay far beyond professional skills.  The team simply did not perceive Vadim as an analyst. <br>  As a result, everyone had a whole bunch of pseudo-objective complaints about his work. <br>  The team members demanded all his documents for review, found fault with the wording of the requirements, argued on each issue, reaching even the direct disregard of the requirements, amateur performances and attempts to solve any issues with the customer through Vadim's head. <br>  With that, when he was just a developer, they had no conflicts. <br><br>  I had to work as a ‚Äúpsychotherapist‚Äù. <br><br>  Over the next two weeks, I held collective meetings with the following content. <br><br><ul><li>  Parsed the TZ written by Vadim, explaining why he did it this way and not otherwise. </li><li>  Explained how to work with the requirements and why </li><li>  Showed abstract case study examples </li></ul><br><br>  After each meeting, the team thanked me and said that now she understood everything and, in general, thanks for telling me. <br>  Vadim was very surprised.  After the first meeting, he told a tete-a-tete that he told the team exactly the same thing as me, but his words were perceived quite differently. <br><br>  Then I told him what was the matter.  Of course, it saddened him, but I encouraged him by saying that in time this would pass. <br>  We continued the collective therapy sessions and after a short time the work of the department returned to normal. <br>  And now, Vadim, in general, is considered one of the best analysts of my former company. <br><br>  Later, I had to face this situation once again, but I was ready and did not waste my time, immediately starting ‚Äúpsychotherapy‚Äù. <br><br>  So if you come across this, do not dwell on the skills, look at people. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295848/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295848/</a></p>
