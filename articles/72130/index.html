  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About myopia bespectacled. Is it possible to restore vision?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello!  I bespectacled with experience.  I put on my glasses in 2000, and since then my eyesight has been constantly deteriorating.  Already -4dptr (without glasses I see clearly only with 25 cm).  Yesterday, I was seriously forced to get rid of my glasses and my disability once and for all.  The reason for this - all sorts of stories on the Internet, how people get rid of glasses, restore their vision.  So it is really possible? <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The situation is aggravated by the fact that the incomes of the manufacturers of glasses and contact lenses are estimated at billions of dollars, and it is much easier for our doctors to write out glasses and thus ‚Äúsolve the problem‚Äù of the patient. <br><br>  So, what is myopia, or myopia.  I did not find a clear and unambiguous answer anywhere.  Basically the wording is ‚Äúbad visibility of objects into the distance‚Äù.  As an illustration, various images with the Photoshop Blur effect are shown, for example:

The fact is that the defocusing effect is familiar to us from video cameras.  But in a video camera, the refracting lens changes its position along the horizontal axis forward or backward.  In the human eye, the biconvex lens plays the role of an internal lens, but it does not move forward or backward, but is compressed or stretched along the vertical axis under the action of the ciliary muscle.  This phenomenon is called accommodation (or adaptation). <br><br>  As I see without glasses when removed from the subject.  I will try to portray in Photoshop: <br><br><img src="http://img.pixs.ru/storage/7/2/0/miopia1gif_8896284_322720.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  Those.  it can be seen that the image is not just blurred, it also forks and multiplies vertically and horizontally, eventually forming a blurred ball of elements.  The only thing is that the degree of visibility of all the bifurcated elements is the same, and not like mine - the middle is darker (this is because of the overlay of the layers in Photoshop). <br><br>  This effect is well noticeable when looking without glasses on street lighting lamps.  They all turn into huge spherical dull spots from the elements.  And for some reason I haven‚Äôt found this feature of myopia in myopia anywhere - perhaps this is the key to how to restore vision. <br><br>  And most importantly, what is still caused by myopia?  It turns out that this question has no definite answer in our 21st century.  According to the same article in Wikipedia, myopia ‚Äúin the overwhelming majority of cases is accompanied by an increase in the anteroposterior size of the eyeball‚Äù, i.e.  the eye is pulled out along the visual axis. <br><br>  The article on <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_(%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F)">accommodation</a> states that ‚Äúalong with the generally accepted theory of Helmholtz, there are other theories of the mechanisms of accommodation.  For example, the rather aggressively promoted, but long-refuted theory of the American ophthalmologist Bates explains accommodation with a contraction of the eye-muscles. "  Ophthalmologist Bates is myopic eye flattened above and below, and not his lens, which in itself is very important. <br><br>  But who to believe?  Is there really no single justification for myopia, but only separate theories?  At one time I was going for a laser surgery to burn my corneas with a laser beam.  But it seems to be all right with the cornea, the form is normal.  If the problem with the muscles of the lens or the eye itself stretched out like a cucumber because of reading close, is it worth cutting your eye and thinning the cornea?  I think no. <br><br>  To understand which direction to go next, you need to figure out what myopia really is, whether it is possible (and where) to undergo a comprehensive examination on this topic, and not to be limited to an eye exam at a table by an ophthalmologist.  Is there a chance to restore vision in a natural way?  Can any of you have this experience?  Any opinions and related links are welcome!  Tired of glasses of strength there. <br><br>  UPD: I found a good note about myopia - <a href="http://www.artoks.ru/pedia-bliz.shtml">here</a> . <br>  Now it is important to answer the question of how to determine the causes of myopia after all: <br>  1. Changed lens shape due to muscle spasm. <br>  2. Changed the shape of the eyeball <br>  3. Other reasons <br><br>  UPD: Writing down <a href="http://www.eyeclinic.ru/index.php/article/archive/150/">here</a> .  It seems that they will be able to determine the cause of myopia, and indeed a comprehensive survey will not hurt.
