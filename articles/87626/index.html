Once there was a suggestion that the Philips 150B4 would be better to connect via DVI, despite the fact that it only accepts VGA, thus, a DVI-VGA adapter was purchased, in this order: <a href="http://docs.google.com/leaf%3Fid%3D0BxmWMwvA3ZamMmJiN2FhZjItNGVmMy00ODJjLWE1NzUtZjAxZGJjZDVlOThj%26hl%3Den"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b09/c64/a40/b09c64a401dc4cee00f80b848193add9.jpg" alt="image"></a>  , and Monique successfully connected to DVI.  That again, not to translate the figure into an analogue or connect a new monik by analogy, I bought exactly such an adapter ... I took up the DVI connector on the board, and the wonderful DVI-VGA adapter went to <s>die to</s> rest on the shelf. <br><br><h4>  Customization </h4>  There was no firewood in the bundle, downloaded from the Internet.  I still do not understand why such a small update rate ... It‚Äôs stated 76, you can only put a maximum of 60. <br><br>  In the process of curbing hardware settings, it was revealed that the buttons, which for the first time seemed inconvenient, turned out to be very practical and were not devoid of logic. <br><br>  Top-down buttons: <ul><li>  Auto </li><li>  Menu </li><li>  Up </li><li>  Down </li><li>  Enter </li></ul><br><br>  Although they are pimps, the fingers can be positioned quite comfortably: from second to fifth, on the Menu, Up, Down, Enter keys <br>  Menu - call the menu and go up a level <br>  Up / Down - move <br>  Enter - going down a level <br>  About the same mean fingers <br><br><br>  Dynamic contrast and brightness, of course, can not please. <br><br>  In the settings there are profiles, volume, Senseye Demo [3], the range of colors, the choice of sorsa, auto power off and the like nonsense. <br><br>  [1]: The fact is that I, up to this point in life, have never had an affair with HDMI and, quite simply, set foot a little.  After all, HDMI, it transmits _multimedianuyu_, therefore, SOUND.  I am sure that for 98% of the habrasoobshchestvo this is not news, but it put me in a light stupor: ‚ÄúINPUT for headphones ... INPUT, it means that the sound should come out of the monica, which means that it must somehow get there, or for sound, which means there are speakers in monica ... which speakers ?, there are none ... or these holes are not just for the heat sink ... can our directors connect, the sound will magically appear? .. no ... as it can get into it ... Vga ... HDMI !  * crawled into Vika and opened his mouth "- my chain of reflections on the output for sound ... now it's funny ... My card is, of course, no SPDIF and others like it, and I have to be content with the sound from the speakers built in 150B4 and analog output from zvukovuhi , no less modern than monique, because I don‚Äôt need to buy columns, and I don‚Äôt strive for it. <br><br>  Actually, the input for headphones, or, better, if the sound output (stupor would be less): <br><br> <a href="http://docs.google.com/leaf%3Fid%3D0BxmWMwvA3ZamNjhiYjNkZTgtNjc4NC00ZGI4LTllNTQtODRlMzYyYTJkYWM0%26hl%3Den"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/83f/905/361/83f9053618597cfda5ddf1bb7cd3d3ee.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  My small webcam, which, perhaps, deserves a separate review, has a small clip, which was successfully attached to 150B4, but it also stuck quite well on the ‚Äúbank‚Äù: <br><br> <a href="http://docs.google.com/leaf%3Fid%3D0BxmWMwvA3ZamNzFkZDIxN2ItNTkwMS00MWFkLTk4MzYtMDlmYmRkMTA3MmRi%26hl%3Den"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0db/e24/dc2/0dbe24dc261aff3d11def6b99fbc50f1.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  [3]: Having cut Senseye Demo the left half of the screen was distorted, although perhaps it seemed to me that the right one remained the same, and I climbed onto the cans site and looked what it is.  Proof I do not remember.  It turns out that this function is not just a bug, but a rather useful thing, as the site says again, but why in the HARDWARE there are demo versions I still don‚Äôt understand ... Do you have any ideas or results about Google?  Maybe you should write a separate article about this? .. <br><br><h4>  Multimonitor configuration </h4>  Something like this.  My vidyaha has two ways, as I said, and since I have an old Monique, I decided to steal it. <br>  Like answering a special topic about multiscreen configurations, I completely agree - __this __zhutko__ conveniently__ <br>  The bank is located ‚Äúcorrectly‚Äù, perpendicular to the line of sight, and the phillips are somewhere at an angle of -50 with the left side of the relative to the can. <br>  <s>Swivel chair</s> <br>  Krutotul allows you to work equally comfortably on one and the other and, as it was not surprising, did not seem on both <br><br><h4>  UPS and his miserable life </h4> Upsik got hold of the bank, directly upsovym wire, in Phillips left to eat only from the outlet.  So I had one extra 220 cable left, a VGA-VGA from a set of banks and a DVI-VGA adapter. <br>  I am sure that this ‚Äúsuperfluous‚Äù will not be superfluous, and will soon find its application. <br><br>  The UPS for some reason began to take, I suddenly and, as it was not surprising, it would have struck with my foot, touched the switch of the socket multiplier / extension and knocked out the fucking computer, and he ... passed out !!! I have the time and desire, no.  Jumps are not observed ... Saw off the leg ?? <br><br><h4>  So, summing up the <s>pros / cons descending</s> results </h4><br><br>  Minuses: <br>  0 Inconvenient attachment to the webcam ... is it a minus ?? <br>  0 There is an audio output ... maybe it's a minus vidyahe ??  (I'm waiting for advice? Can you solder the sound output of the card to HDMI to the monitor?) <br>  - Impossibility or difficulty in installing the maximum screen refresh (waiting for advice) <br>  - Matrix response 5ms, small plumes remain <br>  - Not very large viewing angle from below. <br><br><br>  Pros: <br>  ++++ LED -&gt; <br>  + Of course, 5 million dynamic contrast! <br>  + Matte screen cover <br>  + Viewing angles <br>  + Diagonal - 24 " <br>  + Resolution HD`shnoe - 1920 * 1080 <br>  + Presumably good Senseye (waiting for advice) <br>  + Good refresh rate? <br>  + Monique is big, there is a lot of space behind him, you can keep trash and who will see him ... <br>  + The <s>coffee cup</s> stand is conveniently located under the clave, or rather, the keyboard leaves the exit tray on the table, thus providing an almost orthopedic tilt and less tired hands, the keyboard is visible, you don‚Äôt have to pull the tray, there is a place for trash%) <br>  + Black coating focuses on the image (controversial for some) <br><br><br>  It is possible that you can find many more advantages ... The meeting continues =) <br><br>  In the near future, one can see a review of Phelaine's Ineta, although they have already done this, but not all the minuses are described there and it seems that they do not see any advantages ... <br><br> <a href="http://docs.google.com/leaf%3Fid%3D0BxmWMwvA3ZamZmNiZTc0MWYtZGIxZi00MmYwLTkzZDUtM2JiYjRhMjBkZDA2%26hl%3Den"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bc6/860/b69/bc6860b69141d4279f772d257b078412.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Keep The Earth Lookin 'Great <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/655/328/3dd/6553283ddf5b082bb9c87537334fd849.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>ATTENTION!</b>  This review was written by the <strike>user</strike> dbanet, who really wants to become a habrayuzer and hopes for your help.
