This time, Jim will try to compile a complete list of all the Easter eggs and references to other studio work in Pixar animation films. <br><br><blockquote>  Writes Bernie In: <br>  Jim, could you help me win the argument?  My colleague told me that the robot WALL-E appears in a small cameo in the cartoon " <a href="http://www.ipixar.ru/category/ratatouille">Ratatouille</a> ."  And most importantly, he argued with me for $ 100, saying that I could never find a robot in this cartoon. <br><br><img src="http://www.ipixar.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/ratatouille-dvd-13-web.jpg" alt="walle">

      I took the Ratatouille DVD from my child and reviewed it three times, but did not even notice a hint of <a href="http://www.ipixar.ru/category/wall-e">WALL-E</a> .  If I offer you a percentage of my winnings, will you tell me where to find this robot in the film? <br><br>  Thanks in advance for your help, Bernie V. </blockquote><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Dear Bernie, <br><br>  I must admit that guys from Emeryville love to do such things.  That is, to collect various characters of various cartoons Pixar together.  Take, for example, the studio logo in the international trailer "WALL-E".  When the lamp Luxo Ml.  the lamp burns out, the WALL-E robot goes to the screen to change it. <br><br><img src="http://www.ipixar.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/wall-e-luxo-big-web.jpg" alt="Wall e"><br><br>  They also love to refer to the studio’s early work in the latest works of Pixar.  How many of you did the name of this animated film remind you of the name of the first short film released by the studio (this is “The Adventures of André and Wally B”) ... <br><br><img src="http://www.ipixar.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/andre-wall-b-web.jpg" alt="The Adventures of Andr &amp; # 233; and Wally B"><br><br>  ... which is printed on the spine of one of the books on the bookshelf behind Woody in the cartoon story "Toy Story"? <br><br><img src="http://www.ipixar.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/toy-story-shorts-books-web.jpg" alt="The history of toys"><br><br>  And here, for example, a lamp from “Luxo Ml.” (You know, yes? A lamp from the 80s, which constantly appears in the Pixar logo) ... <br><br><img src="http://www.ipixar.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/pixar-logo-web2.jpg" alt="Lamp"><br><br>  ... also appears in this film by John Lasseter.  It is, however, painted in bright red. <br><br><img src="http://www.ipixar.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/toy-story-lamp-web.jpg" alt="bright red color"><br><br>  Even a yellow ball from “Luxo Ml.” (With a noticeable red asterisk and a blue stripe) ... <br><br><img src="http://www.ipixar.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/luxo-jr-ball-web.jpg" alt="Luxo Ml."><br><br>  ... appears in Toy Story.  This ball was knocked down by Buzz Liter, when he tried to prove to the rest of the toys from Andy's room that he really knows how to fly. <br><br><img src="http://www.ipixar.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/toy-story-luxo-jr-ball-web.jpg" alt="he really knows how to fly"><br><br>  “So when did Pixar begin to intersperse with similar Easter eggs and links to themselves in their cartoons?” You ask.  As far as I know, it began in 1987.  How did this happen?  Studio workers were in a hurry to finish the cartoon “Red's Dreams” (a short film that was planned to be presented at the annual SIGGRAPH festival) and suddenly realized that the circus arena, which was central to the cartoon, was rather boringly colored. <br><br>  Then, in order to revive the cartoon a little, Lasseter and the company transferred the color and texture from the rubber ball from “Luxo Ml.” To the floor of the circus arena in the cartoon “Red Dreams”. <br><br><img src="http://www.ipixar.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/reds-dream-luxo-jr-ball-we.jpg" alt="Red's dreams"><br><br>  And then, a few guys from the SIGGRAPH 1987 contest noted that it was a very smart decision to make a link in Red Dreams to the first approved by the jury of the cartoon competition of the Pixar studio “Luxo Jr.”.  In their opinion, such a link created some kind of subtle connection between these two short films. <br><br>  However, John Lasseter and his team, while working on Red Dreams, didn’t have such an effect in their thoughts.  Speaking frankly, the guys were just looking for a quick way to add a little more color to the dream episode in the cartoon.  But it turned out that they deserved the respect of people with SIGGRAPH for a smart decision ... <br><br>  So “Easter eggs” and links to themselves have become a lifestyle in the Pixar animation studio. <br><br>  That's why the gas station where Andy's mother stopped in <a href="http://www.ipixar.ru/category/toy-story">Toy Story</a> ... <br><br><img src="http://www.ipixar.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/dinoco-filling-station-web.jpg" alt="Gas station"><br><br>  ... becomes a sponsor of the races, which Lightning Makuin dreamed of in Pixar "Cars". <br><br><img src="http://www.ipixar.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/cars-dinoco-tent-web.jpg" alt="becomes a sponsor of races, which Lightning Makuin dreamed of in Pixar's &quot;<a href=&quot;http://www.ipixar.ru/category/cars&quot;> Wheelbarrows </a>&quot;"><br><br>  And the crazy old man, playing chess with himself, in the short animated cartoon “The Game of Gerry” ... <br><br><img src="http://www.ipixar.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/gerris-game-old-man-web.jpg" alt="Game gerry"><br><br>  ... suddenly it turns out to be a toy repairman who was summoned by Al when Woody broke his arm in Toy Story 2. <br><br><img src="http://www.ipixar.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/toy-story-2-gerris-gam-web.jpg" alt="turns out to be a master of mending toys"><br><br>  Keep in mind, many of these jokes and Easter eggs appear on the screen for a few moments.  Here, for example, these funny bitchy little birds from the cartoon “About the Birds”. <br><br><img src="http://www.ipixar.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/for-the-birds-birds-web.jpg" alt="About birds"><br><br>  Have you noticed them in a very fleeting cameo in “Cars”? <br><br><img src="http://www.ipixar.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/cars-for-the-birds-web.jpg" alt="Cameo in &quot;Cars&quot;"><br><br>  Not?  Well, I'm not surprised.  In this film by John Lasseter, birds appear on wires for one tenth of a second.  We can see how they flashed for a moment in the moment when Mack is driving down the highway and the song “Life is a Highway” is playing. <br><br><img src="http://www.ipixar.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/cars-mac-making-faces-web.jpg" alt="Life is a highway"><br><br>  I assure you, guys from Pixar studio are very creative about where to leave the “Easter egg”.  Notice how the ball from the Luxo Jr. short film appears in the Parsi room during Jack Jack's Attack. <br><br><img src="http://www.ipixar.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/jack-jack-attack-ball-web.jpg" alt="Jack Jack Attacks"><br><br>  The toy with which the child is playing suddenly disappears in order to appear in another Pixar project “Circus Star”. <br><br><img src="http://www.ipixar.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/tin-toy-web.jpg" alt="Circus star"><br><br>  Tinney himself (the main character of this cartoon) plays a small cameo in Pixar’s latest short film “Abduction”.  This vulnerable and shy toy is under the bed during the abduction. <br><br><img src="http://www.ipixar.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/lifted-tin-toy-web.jpg" alt="Abduction"><br><br>  If we are talking about bedrooms ... Probably the most famous reference to ourselves was made by Pixar in the monster corporation cartoon.  At the moment of the year, Sally finally returns Boo to the world of people, amidst the clutter in her bedroom there is a ball from “Luxo Ml.” (It can be seen in the photo below - it is next to the easel), as well as a Jesse doll from “Toy Story 2” (left on the white table). <br><br><img src="http://www.ipixar.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/monsters-inc-jessie-luxo-we.jpg" alt="Monsters, Inc"><br><br>  Then Boo carries Sally's toys.  And here it is - the main surprise, sweet little girl stretches her favorite toy to the blue, wool-covered monster.  It is not by chance that her outlines remind us of a clown fish that played a major role in the summer premiere of the 2003 Pixar studio - “Finding Nemo.” <br><br><img src="http://www.ipixar.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/monsters-inc-nemo-web.jpg" alt="Finding Nemo"><br><br>  Such jokes began to set a new trend in the studio.  Animators began to insert hints on films that had not yet been released into cartoons.  Take, for example, the comic book "The Incredibles," which reads a little boy in the dentist's office in the animated film "Finding Nemo." <br><br><img src="http://www.ipixar.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/finding-nemo-incredibles-we.jpg" alt="comic book &quot;The Incredibles&quot;"><br><br>  Or, better yet - how do you like the cameo Stanley in Lamb? <br><br><img src="http://www.ipixar.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/boundin-model-t-web.jpg" alt="cameo stanley in &quot;The Lamb&quot;"><br><br>  Ask who is this Stanley?  Well, Stanley is Stanley Stimer, the founder of Radiator Springs.  This is his statue ripped from the pedestal of the racing car Lightning Makuin, violating the peace and quiet of the south-western town on the way to the Cup of the Ram. <br><br><img src="http://www.ipixar.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/cars-boundin-truck-web.jpg" alt="Stanley Steamer, Founder of the Radiator Springs"><br><br>  I know I know.  Not everyone will be able to understand all these references to other studio work and jokes inside the team in many Pixar cartoons.  But animators see nothing wrong with that.  They prefer internal jokes to remain internal jokes. <br><br>  For example, <a href="http://www.ipixar.ru/category/ratatouille">Linguini</a> ... <br><br><img src="http://www.ipixar.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/august-7e-web.jpg" alt="Linguini"><br><br>  ... plays the role of the unfortunate man who was brutally struck against the walls of his house during the abduction in the cartoon of the same name by Gary Ridstrom. <br><br><img src="http://www.ipixar.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/lifted-linguini-web.jpg" alt="in the cartoon Gary Ridstrom"><br><br>  However, there are so many subtle hints at various studio work that, as animators of Pixar hope, fans will be able to notice.  For example, a trailer with a bug trap from the Life of Insects ... <br><br><img src="http://www.ipixar.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/pizza-truck-bugs-life-web.jpg" alt="in the life of insects"><br><br>  ... this is the same trailer in which Randall appears in the movie <a href="http://www.ipixar.ru/category/monsters-inc">Monsters Corporation</a> . <br><br><img src="http://www.ipixar.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/pizza-planet-truck-monsters.jpg" alt="Monsters, Inc"><br><br>  Have you noticed a Pizza Planet van parked behind a trailer? <br><br><img src="http://www.ipixar.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/ratatouille-dvd-11-web.jpg" alt="Pizza planet"><br><br>  Believe it or not, this particular car (which, by the way, was modeled on the basis of “Toyota HiLux”) appears in every full-length film released by Pixar animation studio by now.  It was this truck that Woody and Buzz got into in an attempt to get to Pizza Planet in the original Toy Story. <br><br><img src="http://www.ipixar.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/pizza-truck-toy-story-1-web.jpg" alt="Pizza Planet in the original Toy Story"><br><br>  The same car “borrowed” space ranger Buzz in Toy Story 2 when he tried to prevent Woody, Jessie and Bull Eye from being sent to a toy museum in Japan. <br><br><img src="http://www.ipixar.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/pizza-planet-truck-ts-2-web.jpg" alt="sent to toy museum in Japan"><br><br>  The same Pizza Planet truck flashes for a moment in the frame; Jill explains his last escape plan to Tanka Ganga. <br><br><img src="http://www.ipixar.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/pizza-planet-truck-nemo-web.jpg" alt="Pizza Planet flashes for a moment in the frame"><br><br>  The Pizza Planet truck appears on the Piston Cup in Cars.  It can be seen in the photo below, on the left - next to the house on wheels similar to Elvis Presley. <br><br><img src="http://www.ipixar.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/pizza-planet-truck-cars-web.jpg" alt="on the Piston Cup in &quot;Cars&quot;"><br><br>  And it immediately sends us to the "Incredibles" - the first full-length cartoon Brad Bird in the animation studio Pixar.  Considering that Brad could be called a stranger when he came to Emeryville, he didn’t immediately see into all the strange traditions of Pixar.  That is why, when the time came to include an obligatory element in the animation - the Pizza Planet truck, Byrd put it in the scene of the return of Pars to the city at high speed on a broken house on wheels ... <br><br><img src="http://www.ipixar.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/the-incredibles-exiting-tra.jpg" alt="The Incredibles"><br><br>  That is why the Pizza Planet truck in The Incredibles has become an indistinct blur. <br><br><img src="http://www.ipixar.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/pizza-truck-incredibles-web.jpg" alt="Pizza Planet truck"><br><br>  But by the time Ratatouille was coming out, Brad was finally becoming a real pixarist in his view of cartoons.  That is why he happily included the Pizza Planet truck in the company of other cars driving around Paris. <br><br><img src="http://www.ipixar.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/ratatouille-dvd-9-web.jpg" alt="Ratatouille"><br><br>  However, keep in mind that Byrd did not make it easier for fans of cartoons to find a car.  So he made the Pizza Planet truck part of the background — he crosses the bridge in an episode when Skinner chases Remi on a scooter in the foreground. <br><br><img src="http://www.ipixar.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/ratatouille-dvd-9-closeup-w.jpg" alt="he made the Pizza Planet truck part of the background"><br><br>  Speaking of strange things that can be seen in “Ratatouille” ... You saw that Brad made Bombs of Voyage (Remember? The crazy criminal of demolition, which Mr. Incredible found during the robbery of the bank in the “The Incredibles”) ... <br><br><img src="http://www.ipixar.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/ratatouille-dvd-12-web.jpg" alt="bank robberies in the &quot;Incredibles&quot;"><br><br>  ... play the role of a mime working on the streets of Paris in Ratatouille? <br><br><img src="http://www.ipixar.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/ratatouille-dvd-10-web.jpg" alt="mime in &quot;Ratatuye&quot;"><br><br>  Plus, there are so many obvious Easter eggs.  For example, when “Insect Life” shows “unsuccessful doubles,” it turns out that Woody is working as a regular worker in this Pixar animation. <br><br><img src="http://www.ipixar.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/bugs-life-woody-eyes-open-w.jpg" alt="insect life failed duplicates"><br><br>  And Flick consciously uses Buzz Laiter’s motto “To infinity and beyond!” Instead of exclaiming “For the Colony and the oppressed beetles all over the world!”. <br><br><img src="http://www.ipixar.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/a-bugs-life-to-infinity-we.jpg" alt="To infinity and beyond!"><br><br>  But, for example, when showing “failed duplicates” in Toy Story 2, Flick first tells Heimlich how to work well on Life of Insects 2 ... <br><br><img src="http://www.ipixar.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/toy-story-2-a-bugs-life-we.jpg" alt="Toy Story 2"><br><br>  ... and then, after the machete of Buzz Laiter falls on a bush, on which a caterpillar and an ant are found, it turns out that in fact they are being shot in Toy Story 2. <br><br><img src="http://www.ipixar.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/toy-story-2-a-bugs-life-re.jpg" alt="they are filmed in Toy Story 2"><br><br>  However, for every such reference to other cartoons or to every similar Pixar's “Easter egg” (similar in the sense of the obvious, indisputable), there are very hidden, imperceptible finds.  For example, a ball from “Luxo Ml.”, Which with some frequency rolls in the background in the DVD menu of “Toy Story 2”. <br><br><img src="http://www.ipixar.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/toy-story-2-dvd-luxo-jr-bal.jpg" alt="DVD &quot;Toy Story 2&quot;"><br><br>  What (finally!) Brings us to the answer to the question of Bernie V. The question was: “Where exactly can we find a WALL-E robot in Ratatouille?” <br><br><img src="http://www.ipixar.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/wall-e-teaser-poster-web.jpg" alt="Wall e"><br><br>  To be honest, colleague Bernie most likely wanted to trick his friend.  The main character of the new cartoon, Andrew Stanton, does not really appear in the cartoon "Ratatouille."  However, this cute, small robot can be seen in the new short film Pixar, which is in the appendix on the Ratatouille DVD and is called “Your friend is a rat”. <br><br><img src="http://www.ipixar.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/your-friend-the-rat-title-w.jpg" alt="Your friend is rat"><br><br>  “So where is the WALL-E robot?” You ask.  Well ... towards the end of the story, Remi and Emil sing a song called “Plan B.”  And at some point the songs they fantasize about the fact that people and rats happily sit inside the futuristic star transport, which travels on the surface of the planet and approaches the place of launching a rocket. <br><br><img src="http://www.ipixar.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/ratatouille-dvd-3-web.jpg" alt="So where is the robot WALL-E?"><br><br>  If you look closely at the driver of this transport, you will see a simplified version of the WALL-E robot, the hero of the same-name film Pixar, which will be released in the summer of 2008. <br><br><img src="http://www.ipixar.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/ratatouille-dvd-3-closeup-w.jpg" alt="Wall e"><br><br>  As for the share of the winnings, Bernie W, I will tell you this.  Why don't you hold this money for a few days?  Next week there will be a great chance and I can tell readers a great solution where you can donate this money. <br><br>  via <a href="http://ipixar.ru/">iPixar</a> <br><br>  PS By the way, in the Pixar cartoons there are still a lot of interesting elements, you can’t call them Easter eggs, but "hidden advertising" and "interesting sketches" also deserve special attention, for example, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/i_am_clever/27573.html">Apple-Car in the cartoon "Cars"</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/19904/">https://habr.com/ru/post/19904/</a></p>
