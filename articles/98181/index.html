  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Habrovodstvo</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the light of recent publications (and their quality), I would like to share habrodstvo - a set of recommendations on how to behave in Habr√© with the greatest efficiency. <br><br><h4>  The main elements of the first post on Habr√© </h4><br>  At the very beginning it is <i>necessary</i> to write "this is my first post on Habr√© - do not minus especially."  This is the so-called ‚Äúhabroimmunity‚Äù, which acts effectively in 99% of cases. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In 1% of cases, when <i>you are really unlucky</i> , and your post is jammed, do not be discouraged, but do the following: <ul><li>  Highlight the phrase ‚Äúthis is my first post on Habr√© - don't minus too much‚Äù in bold - it will not help to cancel already-minus minuses, but will significantly increase the chances of being missed by newly arrived readers. </li><li>  At the end, write the phrase ‚ÄúPS At least write why minus‚Äù - this will force readers who have already put a minus to go to your post again and write why they are wrong </li></ul>  If the previous tips did not work and your first post is still jammed, then do not worry - go to profile, reset karma and write the second post "This is my last post on Habr√©."  Since habrovchane love honesty, it really becomes the last post.  To prevent this from happening, write a second post in a week, or in a month, when everyone will already forget about the first one.

    <h4>  Commenting rules </h4><br>  Adhere to the following rules when commenting: <ul><li>  if the post has the word "Apple", then you need to make sure that everyone knows how to properly hold the iPhone, and if you are not 100% sure that everyone knows, you must bring a photo with an illustration of how Steve Jobs does it </li><li>  if the post has the word ‚ÄúMicrosoft‚Äù - this is your finest hour and you can write anything you want - for example, ‚Äúsend from my ubunta‚Äù, ‚ÄúIE6 sucks‚Äù, ‚Äúeven my wife is smarter than these winusers‚Äù, etc.  Remember - it‚Äôs not quality that matters, but quantity. </li><li>  if there is a mention of Linux OS in the post, it is necessary to point out its imperfection and tell about Bolgenos, preferably showing contempt for a person who has not heard about it (and there are 99% of such people in Habr√©) </li><li>  insert co.  and a picture with a big bang theory wherever it is possible - it always increases your chances that the person to whom you turned will honor you and add to friends </li></ul>  It is advisable to confirm all comments with reference to Wikipedia or Lurk. <br><br><h4>  UFO cult </h4><br>  At a time when ufologists have been trying in vain to prove the existence of a UFO, this fact has long been obvious to users of Habr.  UFO is present in all polls, it invites users, and sometimes with a dirty yellow font it writes some kind of garbage.  You should not ignore this rule and at least several times a day should write about UFOs in the comments. <br><br><h4>  What to write about? </h4><br>  This question is asked frequently, while the answer is simple - you can write about everything that you like.  Search is not necessary to use - it still works sucks. <br><br>  At the moment, several reviews of the iPhone 4 are very lacking in Habr√©, no one has yet published a video about the history of Apple devices, and the new dev features of Google Chrome build need a detailed review.  Write about how much you downloaded mp3 and movies per day and publish an extended report on Google Docs with the label "copyright".  You also need to reprint all the articles from tech-ups, pisyworld, and blue, because otherwise this news will remain unnoticed by a wide audience.  You can also tell about your startup, which you did yesterday in a minibus while you were driving home, and also ask for money for its development. <br><br>  There is no need to write articles about artificial intelligence, data mining and algorithms, and in no case should you write <i>technical articles</i> , since nobody reads them anyway.  3 paragraphs - the best volume of the article, otherwise you can get comments in the style of "mnogabukf", "niasilil", "did not read, but asusuyu". <br><br>  And most importantly - be rude to everyone, defiantly show your contempt for those who disagree with your opinion and then Habr will have a long and successful development. <br><br>  Good articles! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/98181/">https://habr.com/ru/post/98181/</a></p>
