And we all witnessed examples of automatic translation, which made us laugh to tears.  In order to understand the meaning of a text in a foreign language that you do not know, an automatic translator is enough.  But what if you need to write a text in a foreign language?  You can not just trust ...

This system looks a bit <b>like Google Translate</b> , but the <b>translation itself is performed by people</b> - professional translators, native speakers. <br><br>  This article is a story of creation, a little about how Nitro works and what benefits Habrozhiteli and mere mortals bring. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Who is there? </h2><br>  So, we work in a company that deals with  translation into foreign languages.  Not quite an ordinary translation agency - a bit of everything: localization of programs and websites, creation of texts and reference systems, production of promotional and training videos, production of people, ninja education, development of own products ... <br><br><h2>  Pain </h2><br>  The whole translation world (and we are no exception) hates the translation of the ‚Äúpair of lines‚Äù.  This is when, for example, a client asks to translate 3 lines from a new dialogue of a new version of the program, a small text to a website or a letter into 20 languages.  Sometimes several times a day. <br><br>  Not only project managers don‚Äôt like such small work (you don‚Äôt get caught up with translators), but also the translators themselves: who will love it when every now and then they distract small things from ‚Äúbig‚Äù work. <br><br>  And most of all the notorious "couple of lines" hate the clients themselves.  They have a freezing effect from this, an important correspondence is inhibited, time is spent communicating with translators or an agency, and the traditional minimum order amount of a translation bureau of 40 euros is stinging eyes. <br><br><h2>  Medicine </h2><br>  We began to think about the sort of magic system, so that everyone was good, and came up with <a href="https://alconost.com/services/professional-online-translation%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3Down_article%26utm_content%3Dhow-we-made-nitro">Alconost Nitro</a> .  Nitro - because it is fast, like an engine with a nitrous oxide system.  And <a href="https://alconost.com/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3Down_article%26utm_content%3Dhow-we-made-nitro">Alconost</a> is the name of our company. <br><br><h2>  How it works? </h2><br>  Nitro is <s>4 rooms</s> 3 offices: Translator, Client, Administrator. <br><br>  The client logs in to the system and can do just a couple of things: replenish the account, choose the direction of transfer and enter the text to be translated (well, even <s>for a bore</s> if you need to write a comment for the translator). <br><br>  After the client has sent the text for translation, he enters the pool of orders available for translation. <br><br>  And at this time, in the Translator's office, on the other side of the planet, the translator is on duty (and if not on duty, then Nitro will call him by email) and the interpreter takes the order for execution.  If the translator does not like the order (for example, not his topic), he may skip it temporarily, but Nitro will continue to persistently ask the translator to take it, if no one else has taken it. <br><br>  As soon as the translator has sent the finished order back, it becomes available in the Client's online office (yes, you can just sit and wait, and the translation will appear without refreshing the page, as in the ‚ÄúEstonian‚Äù google translate), and also duplicated by email.  Most of the clients do not wait and close the browser, go about their business and receive their translation during the day. <br><br>  By itself, everything works by itself at 99.9%.  And the remaining 0.1% has to be refined by the valiant Administration of the service, which cleans the pipes for translators if all of a sudden everything is offline (new year, football, summer holidays), connects and disconnects translators, monitors quality, talks with customers, etc. <br><br><h2>  About money </h2><br>  The standard scheme of work of a translation agency is order evaluation, coordination, prepayment, order fulfillment, final settlement and accompanying contracts, papers, acts, currency control in places ... - in general, this is not all for a couple of lines.  And we came up with a ‚Äúvirtual account‚Äù, which can be replenished in advance and then spend money on the transfer within it. <br><br>  The amount for the translation is calculated automatically, as the customer types the text, because we know the number of words and the price per word at the time of the order.  An account can be replenished in a variety of pleasant ways - from bank transfer to Webmoney and Yandex.Money.  And for regular customers, we made it possible to work on credit - in case replenishment of the account takes time, and the transfer is needed very urgently. <br><br><h2>  Languages ‚Äã‚Äãand prices </h2><br>  Directions of translation - the most popular entrepreneurs from IT, focused on work in the international market.  Full list with prices on the link: <a href="https://alconost.com/services/professional-online-translation">https://alconost.com/services/professional-online-translation#anchor-6</a> <br><br>  Of the unusual - there is even a translation into Latin.  Not to say that it is in high demand, but ... in the world there is no such thing.  They translate mainly individual phrases, which are then engraved on gifts.  It is possible that somewhere there are people who have translated into Latin for tattoo in Nitro. <br><br><h2>  Who needs these benefits? </h2><br>  Nitro as air turned out to be necessary for us in the <a href="http://alconost.com/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3Down_article%26utm_content%3Dhow-we-made-nitro">big Alconost</a> .  We took the stress off our translation project managers.  Dozens of small orders a day, strands and strands of gray hair ... <br><br>  But it turned out that besides ourselves in the world is full of people who liked the service: webmasters, software developers, Internet entrepreneurs, inventors, owners of online stores, businessmen, Russian brides, Godzilla and even <a href="http://www.exler.ru/blog/item/10942/">Alex Exler personally</a> . <br><br>  Users of the service alone were suddenly able to maintain multilingual projects and websites and to correspond in at least 20 languages ‚Äã‚Äãat once. <br><br>  Texts, letters look after translation more literate, seasoned in the right style, as the work of a professional translator improves even a mediocre text. <br><br>  There is even an opportunity to read the text by a native speaker. <br><br>  Nitro saves time - after all, it is much faster to formulate a thought in your native language and quickly translate into Nitro.  The result of the translation will be exactly what I wanted to say, and not what allowed me to write a limited vocabulary. <br><br>  In general, Nitro is such a cool service that if we hadn‚Äôt written Nitro, Nitro would have written itself! <br><br>  And here it is: <a href="https://alconost.com/services/professional-online-translation%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3Down_article%26utm_content%3Dhow-we-made-nitro">https://alconost.com/services/professional-online-translation</a> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">A small and very old video about how the service works.</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t88WiG7TFlI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></div><br><br>  We will be very happy for your suggestions, criticism and questions about the service. <br><br>  Thanks for your time and attention! <br><br><br>  <b>about the author</b> <br><br>  Alconost is engaged in the <a href="https://alconost.com/services/software-localization%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3Down_article%26utm_content%3Dhow-we-made-nitro">localization of applications, games and websites</a> in 60 languages.
