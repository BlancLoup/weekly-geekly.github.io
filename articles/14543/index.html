So far, it is driven around in the "by invitations" mode, which is quite simple to get: for this you need to go into the <a href="http://del.icio.us/help/preview/">specials.</a>  <a href="http://del.icio.us/help/preview/">section</a> and follow the instructions that were done by me :) <br><br>  The other day (at the expiration, no less, two weeks), I still received that cherished invitation and now I would like to share my impressions of the updated del.icio.us.  More precisely, that caught my eye, because  thoroughly test the service until there was time ... <br><br>  So let's go ... <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h1>  Where are the dots? </h1><br>  The guys made a "rebranding": now it's not unpredictable for newcomers <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> , but simply <a href="http://delicious.com/">delicious.com</a> .  The comrades-makers themselves explain this by the difficulty of remembering the old name, as well as the fact that far from everyone could ‚Äúoverpower‚Äù it (honestly, I also did not immediately remember :) <br><br><blockquote>  [...] the dots were confusing, especially for new users [...] </blockquote><br><br>  At the same time, the old address will still work (for example, I like it more). <br><br><h1>  Face change </h1><br>  The new design personally pleased me with its simplicity and functionality.  I was delighted to see him for the first time, and the first thing that came to my mind was how good it was that those blue inscriptions on a red background, which certainly irritated not only me, disappeared. <br><br>  Here is a small photo report from the scene: <br><br> <a href="" title="Welcome to the Delicious Preview!"><img src="http://unixway.in.ua/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/delicious_preview_help.thumbnail.jpeg" alt="Welcome to the Delicious Preview!"></a> <a href="" title="Delicious home"><img src="http://unixway.in.ua/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/delicious.thumbnail.jpeg" alt="Delicious home"></a> <a href="" title="Pashka R.‚Äôs Bookmarks"><img src="http://unixway.in.ua/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/delicious_pashka_r.thumbnail.jpeg" alt="Pashka R.‚Äôs Bookmarks"></a> <a href="" title="Pashka R.‚Äôs Network"><img src="http://unixway.in.ua/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/delicious_network_pashka_r.thumbnail.jpeg" alt="Pashka R.‚Äôs Network"></a> <a href="" title="pashka_r‚Äôs Tags"><img src="http://unixway.in.ua/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/delicious_tags_pashka_r.thumbnail.jpeg" alt="pashka_r‚Äôs Tags"></a> <br><br><h1>  But what about the functional? </h1><br>  There have also been a number of improvements on this front: <br><br><h2>  Bookmarks </h2><br>  The guys changed the bookmark layout, making it more readable and understandable ... In particular, the look and feel of the ‚Äúbookmark popularity‚Äù field was redesigned. <br><br><blockquote>  We've refined our bookmarks to read at a glance.  [...] Say goodbye to salmon on blue!  The count of bookmarks can be determined around the save count. </blockquote><br><br><h2>  Navigation </h2><br>  Site navigation is made in the form of a drop-down menu.  I don‚Äôt really like this kind of thing, especially (this is primarily due to the fact that the menu itself is often hidden when the mouse leaves it, which is annoying, especially when I use the touchpad on the laptop. But here it is hidden only clicking on the menu or outside of it, i.e., the behavior of the menu is very natural) on web pages, but here everything turned out very well and, most importantly, very convenient. <br><br><blockquote>  We organized the site into three main sections: Bookmarks, People and Tags.  When you are logged in, you can access your bookmarks, network and tags pages.  Tags: </blockquote><br><br><h2>  Tags </h2><br>  Oh, there were no limits to my joy here at all ... They did what the Bolsheviks had been saying for so long on Habr√©, which I myself often thought about - this is a multiple choice of tags.  It looks like this: <br><br> <a href="" title="Recent webdev, python and django Bookmarks"><img src="http://unixway.in.ua/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/delicious_tags_features.thumbnail.jpeg" alt="Recent webdev, python and django Bookmarks"></a> <br><br>  Also in the field for entering the name of the tag works auto-addition, which also can not but rejoice. <br><br><blockquote>  Use your new Tag Bar to quickly navigate your bookmarks by using the tags and tag combinations.  Viewing has never been easier with the tag autocomplete.  Using the ways of using the latest technology </blockquote><br><br><h2>  View, filters and search </h2><br>  Display bookmarks can now not just lists of different dimensions.  In the new version of the service, it is possible to specify the details of this list: only the title, title + keywords and title + description + keywords. <br><br>  Added the ability to filter bookmarks by the number of users who saved it.  And the search results include not only your own and general bookmarks, but also search results in the context of selected tags - i.e.  delicious remembers the tags selected last time - very, I will say, convenient. <br><br><blockquote>  Search for your own bookmarks.  For example, you can find a tag, your Network, or your network. </blockquote><br><br><h1>  Summing up </h1><br>  It seems that this is only the tip of the iceberg of changes and improvements that I was able to notice during the few tens of minutes that I spent watching the service.  Surely the developers have improved the engine by increasing the speed of work and preparing the ground for the introduction of new features :) <br><br>  In general, I was very pleased with what he saw.  The service has become really much more beautiful and more comfortable and I can‚Äôt wait for the moment when the updated delicious opens the doors to everyone :) <br><br><h1>  PS </h1><br>  Although all bookmarks, tags, etc. (except friends) from the first version were transferred to the demo version, the developers clarify that the data will not be synchronized and that after the test period is completed, all changes made to it will be lost.  This was done specifically so that users can test all the functions of the service without fear of losing data ... <br><br><blockquote>  This is a "sandbox" environment.  You can play around with your collection of bookmarks.  You can use your export settings.  We'll remind you about it. </blockquote><br><br>  And yet ... this post is my debut as a ‚Äúbrowser‚Äù, so I‚Äôll ask you not to kick much, but it‚Äôs a constructive one ‚Äî as always, it‚Äôs welcome ... although I hope that the review is not terribly awful :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/14543/">https://habr.com/ru/post/14543/</a></p>
