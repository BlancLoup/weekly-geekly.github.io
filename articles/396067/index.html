So far, there are no ideal systems of this type, and if there are, then they cost a lot.  But nothing prevents you from using smart gadgets in an ordinary house, which can also make our lives more comfortable. <br><br>  There are quite a few such devices - smart cameras, alarm clocks, and all sorts of coffee makers, refrigerators and security systems.  All devices can not be described - for this you need several years of work and a lot of free time.  But some of these gadgets are probably worth considering. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Shock Clock </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3d8/334/c2c/3d8334c2cce71d8eae21188c3fae8e35.jpg" width="750">

      How hard is it for you to get up in the morning?  For many people - very hard.  Even if an important meeting is scheduled in the morning, you need to pass an exam or a quarterly report - not everyone can get up on time.  Previously, for a quick wake-up, the usual mechanical alarm clock was set in an iron bowl with small change.  In the morning there was such a roar that the neighbors in the nearby house sometimes woke up. <br><br>  Now there are not so many mechanical alarms, but you still need to get up.  And in order not to oversleep, you can use a really effective method - Shock Clock.  This watch can start awakening with a vibration, a sound signal, and end with a shock or even three consecutive shocks.  This is no longer overslept. <br><br>  Already a couple of days after the gadget test, users jumped out of bed 10 minutes before the wake-up signal.  Of course, who wants to get a shock, or even all three.  Application settings allow you to block the alarm, so that it will beat the current and signal until the person gets up (determined with the help of a gyroscope). <br><br><h3>  Withings Smart Body Analyzer WS-50 </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e3a/918/3e3/e3a9183e349b714517b0c81050dc372f.jpg" width="750"><br><br>  At first glance, it is scales.  And in fact, this device can measure the user's weight without problems.  But the device can do much more than just weigh. <br><br>  It can determine the ratio of fat and water in the human body.  In addition, he knows how to count the pulse.  Determine the scales and the amount of carbon dioxide from the ambient temperature. <br><br>  The collected data scales are transferred wirelessly (Wi-Fi and Bluetooth) to the user's mobile device.  Both Android and iOS are supported.  In general, these are no longer scales, but indeed, a whole analyzer of your body and the microclimate of the rooms in which we live. <br><br><h3>  Thermal imager Seek Thermal Xr </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/556/11d/142/55611d142629915894facc3b3ed2ded7.jpg" width="750"><br><br>  A thermal imager is a device that allows you to "see" the temperature of various objects, displaying a color image in which different colors correspond to different temperatures. <br><br>  The thermal imager will help detect and repair heat or cold leaks, see the local heating or overheating of equipment, notice problems with electrical wiring, and find prey while hunting - in the dark or in the bush.  Thermal imagers are quite expensive.  For example, Testo 875-1 with a matrix of 160x120 pixels costs 139,000 rubles. <br><br>  In the house or garage, such a system is useful to many.  So, it can be used to search for defects leading to local heating: <br><ul><li>  Overheating locations of electronic circuit boards indicate problems with contact or individual circuit components. </li><li>  Local overheating mechanisms signaling lubrication problems or worn bearings. </li><li>  High temperatures in certain areas of the electrical network will help to detect poor contact or short circuit. </li><li>  Any other defects that are manifested by fever and are difficult to find in other ways. </li></ul><br>  Recently, Seek Thermal thermal imagers connected to smartphones appeared on the market.  Their matrix has a resolution of 206x156 pixels.  Due to the fact that the smartphone is involved in all the processing and visualization, the price of such a thermal imager starts from 25,900 rubles.  On Geektimes the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dadget/blog/278056/">good detailed review of</a> this device was <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dadget/blog/278056/">published</a> . <br><br>  There are two versions of the system - <a href="https://dadget.ru/katalog/dom-i-dacha/seek-thermal-xr/%3Futm_referrer%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_term%3Dseek-thermal-xr%26utm_content%3Dseek-thermal-xr%26utm_campaign%3Dseek-thermal-xr_274">for iOS</a> and for <a href="https://dadget.ru/katalog/dom-i-dacha/teplovisor-smartphone-seek-thermal-xr/%3Futm_referrer%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_term%3Dteplovisor-smartphone-seek-thermal-xr%26utm_content%3Dteplovisor-smartphone-seek-thermal-xr%26utm_campaign%3Dteplovisor-smartphone-seek-thermal-xr_274">Android</a> . <br><br><h3>  Sony LED Light Bulb Speaker </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/86a/38e/8fc/86a38e8fcbb3773fedf7a109217947f6.jpg" width="750"><br><br>  This is a light bulb and a wireless speaker.  The brightness of the bulb is 360 lumens, which is enough to illuminate the room.  The system wirelessly connects to the smartphone, and can respond to various events.  In addition, the light bulb can play music - so, if you want to make a light music club at home, it is quite possible to organize it. <br><br>  Unfortunately, the gadget is difficult to get - it is available mainly in Japan.  In other countries, Sony LED Light Bulb Speaker is sold, but in rare places. <br><br><h3>  Universal Remote for Smartphone "Multipult" </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/16f/30c/0a0/16f30c0a0924ed722d7a80de4909d21a.jpg" width="750">  &gt; <br><br>  This small device allows using a smartphone or a tablet to control all devices where IR control is provided.  This air conditioning, TV, stereos, fans and everything else.  All you need to do is to connect the ‚ÄúMultipult‚Äù to the headphone jack, select the desired device in the application and select the desired function. <br><br>  The advantage of such a remote control is the ability to work with it outside the home.  For example, you do not like loud TV in a cafe?  We take the remote and quietly turn down the volume. <br><br>  To work with "Multipult" you need to install the application for Android.  Purchasing Multipult is not a problem, it <a href="https://dadget.ru/katalog/multimedia/universalnoe-pdu-multipult//%3Futm_referrer%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_term%3Duniversalnoe-pdu-multipult%26utm_content%3Duniversalnoe-pdu-multipult%26utm_campaign%3Duniversalnoe-pdu-multipult_274">is sold in many</a> stores. <br><br><h3>  Amazon echo </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cf1/041/90a/cf104190aa9f049995868071fc2990cd.jpg" width="750"><br><br>  This is not just a wireless speaker, but a human digital assistant.  Amazon company supplies a device with a virtual assistant, which has its own name - Alexa.  When working with the Network, an assistant can tell a lot - read news, play music, report on the latest events in a particular area. <br><br>  In addition, this gadget is compatible with IFTTT, so it can be customized for other tasks. <br><br>  In fact, the capabilities of Amazon Echo look amazing for such a small device. <br><br><h3>  CO2 sensor </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/609/2dc/c2f/6092dcc2ff3340eea4c0727347a8f234.png" width="750">  &gt; <br><br>  If the level of carbon dioxide in the air is above the norm, then the person‚Äôs well-being deteriorates.  A yawn appears.  A person, without even noticing it, begins to get annoyed over trifles, will not be able to concentrate on an important matter, and if he concentrates, the thought process will proceed slowly.  Naturally, such symptoms may have other causes, but the most frequent in real life and very easily resolved is the concentration of carbon dioxide that is too high. <br><br>  This problem is relevant both for home and office.  It can be solved using a CO2 detector.  Inside the device is a sensitive sensor that measures the number of CO2 molecules in the air.  The measurement results are immediately displayed on a small LCD display, which is located on the device.  In addition to information on the concentration of CO2, the carbon dioxide detector shows the ambient temperature.  In addition to the display, there are also LEDs in three colors - green, yellow and red.  Green - everything is good, yellow - it is possible and better, red - you need to leave all the work and do the airing! <br><br>  By the way, the device can be improved, for example, use <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dadget/blog/271666/">Raspberry in conjunction</a> with it.  And <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dadget/blog/276316/">you can connect a Wi-Fi module</a> to another device, why not? <br><br>  Buy a detector <a href="https://dadget.ru/detektor-co2/%3Futm_referrer%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_term%3Ddetektor-co2%26utm_content%3Ddetektor-co2%26utm_campaign%3Ddetektor-co2_274">here</a> . <br><br><h3>  Netatmo connect </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/UndUmz48X9g%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhh0lMOGG17XKE8btDyMzl-LhtW9Uw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  A smart weather station that can assist in managing a smart home.  At first glance, it‚Äôs just a weather station that measures temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide levels and noise.  For this purpose, special sensors are used. <br><br>  The system is equipped with a wireless Wi-Fi module that transmits all the data collected by the station to one place - on a user's smartphone or tablet. <br><br>  The weather station can work as an alarm clock, so it is worth trying this opportunity as well.  The system is also compatible with the IFTTT service and can be configured as an element of the algorithm.  For example, if the temperature drops to a certain value, the heating is turned on.  If the temperature is higher than necessary, the air conditioner starts to work - and, for example, by the arrival of the owner from work at home, a pleasant coolness reigns everywhere. <br><br>  The system is able to use weather reports from the Internet. <br><br><h3>  Tesla: a self-charging electric lighter that works everywhere </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/349/9fe/0f3/3499fe0f394b11400871b9cfdd3b7391.jpg" width="750"><br><br>  According to the developers, the system is a combination of electromagnetic induction and an electric arc in an aluminum-magnesium package.  As mentioned above, all that needs to be done is to shake the lighter before use. <br><br>  The system produces electricity when a neodymium magnet moves with a diametrical magnetization in a spiral.  A single shake generates a charge that is sufficient for the operation of an electric arc for a duration of 3 seconds. <br><br>  The aluminum-magnesium body of the lighter is impact resistant and does not corrode over time.  Well, and the rubber inserts protect the inside of the lighter from water and dust (IP55w). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/396067/">https://habr.com/ru/post/396067/</a></p>
