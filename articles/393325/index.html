      ‚ÄúThe work program for this project provides for testing the robot at the obstacle course at the end of the year.  Avatar has to overcome its elements, demonstrate the ability to control various technical devices, including a car, to climb the stairs, ‚Äù <a href="http://rg.ru/2016/04/25/reg-cfo/v-internete-poiavilis-foto-novejshih-rossijskih-boevyh-robotov.html">said</a> Vitaly Davydov, Deputy General Director of the Foundation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/134/e13/0e4/134e130e4f24450886be1bac10c2732e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fb6/ebf/24d/fb6ebf24da21430aa512181d8067fc99.jpg"><br><br>  Initially, the creation of an anthropomorphic robot was carried out in the interests of the Emergencies Ministry for rescue work.  However, it was subsequently taken into account that most of the components of the rescue robot can also be used for solving military tasks, as well as <a href="http://rg.ru/2016/02/13/rogozin-v-rf-sozdadut-robota-avatara-dlia-raboty-v-kosmose.html">in astronautics</a> . <br><br>  ‚ÄúAvatar will be one of the crew members of the future Russian national orbital station,‚Äù said Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin in February.  Such development will allow, without a special spacesuit, to go into outer space and, under the control of an operator-astronaut under protection, carry out particularly complex operations on board the spacecraft. <br><br><h3>  "Lynx-BP" </h3><br>  ‚ÄúLynx-BP‚Äù is a biomorphic robot, that is, similar to an animal, on four legs.  They plan to arm it not only with a machine gun, but also with anti-tank guided missiles, <a href="http://ria.ru/defense_safety/20160328/1398554481.html">said</a> Vladimir Shashok, director general of the enterprise developing the Lynx enterprise, the Signal Research Institute.  According to him, three variants of target load are considered: an intelligence robot, a combat support robot and a robot for carrying goods.  ‚ÄúThe combat robot will most likely be equipped with a machine gun, and the installation of an ATGM is possible,‚Äù he said. <br><br>  The robot must be able to move on any surfaces and water up to 40 cm in depth, overcome thresholds up to 500 mm, staircases of industrial buildings with an inclination angle of up to 30 ¬∞ and a step height of 200 mm, trenches up to 500 mm wide and walls up to 400 mm high and up to 300 mm wide. <br><br>  On the plain, the robot will reach speeds of up to 15 km / h, over rough terrain - up to 10 km / h. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bbd/6ca/c7c/bbd6cac7cc764d7887739527e56d4d7c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a45/6fb/aa7/a456fbaa7cbb40eab703a992b43ed056.jpg"><br><br>  State tests "Lynx-BP" is scheduled to be held in 2019. <br><br>  <a href="http://zakupki.gov.ru/223/purchase/public/purchase/info/common-info.html%3FnoticeId%3D2736097">The terms of reference</a> for an open competition for the right to conclude a contract for the execution of an integral part of the experimental design work on the subject ‚ÄúBasic platforms for mobile biomorphic robots‚Äù contains some technical characteristics of the robot. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Excerpt from the technical specifications</b> <div class="spoiler_text"> <b>Basic platform of an average mobile biomorphic robot weighing up to 400 kg</b> <br>  Full name - The basic platform of a mobile biomorphic robot weighing up to 400 kg. <br>  The abbreviated name is BPMBR400. <br><br>  The structure of BPMRB400 should include: <br>  platform;
