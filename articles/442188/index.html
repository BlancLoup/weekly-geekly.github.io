      - But seriously?  - intervened Gene.  - I haven't seen you like this for a long time.  What did you say? <br><br>  - He said that he did not care about what we think about ourselves.  He needs an information technology service as a service.  Service unit. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  - What is it like?  - asked Stas.  - Someone to serve something?  Accounting? <br><br>  - Yes, first of all.  They say we do. <br><br>  - Even if you do not agree with the production?  - Stas did not let up. <br><br>  ‚ÄúEven if it‚Äôs not our job at all.‚Äù  - answered Ivan on the move.  - Something we did not like the new director. <br><br>  - Did you tell him about your projects?  On a warehouse, on purchases.  - asked Gena. <br><br>  - Of course I told.  And offered a couple of similar projects to do.  In terms of production, for example, processes should be adjusted, quality worked, planning done. <br><br>  - And what is he?  Doesn't want something?  - asked Igor. <br><br>  - Not.  Says - thank you, do not.  - looking out the window, said Ivan.  - He is going to recruit a team of managers, his own, set a goal for them and restore order. <br><br>  - Well, okay, why are you soaring, then?  - Stas said with contrived enthusiasm.  - What is the difference, what to do. <br><br>  - You, maybe, and no, but I do not want to engage in any nonsense.  - Ivan began to lose his temper.  - What is the point of spending time on accounting?  BUT?  Tell me, nerd. <br><br>  - Why did you start something?  - a little frightened asked Stas.  - Do I force you to engage in bookkeeping? <br><br>  - You fucking just said - what's the difference, what to do.  - Ivan continued aggressively. <br><br>  - Hey, girls, do not quarrel.  - entered Gena. <br><br>  - You forgot to ask.  - Ivan turned and pointedly looked at Gena.  - What do you think, is it normal to be ‚Äúan information technology service, as a service‚Äù? <br><br>  - Well, I do not know ... Normally, it seems.  - smiled, said Gena. <br><br>  - And, you're new, did not work with accounting.  - Ivan smiled in response.  - Well, I'll explain to you.  This makes no sense.  At all.  Do you understand?  At all!  Automating accounting, helping accounting is not a goal, not a project, it is a process.  Process, understand?  Endless! <br><br>  - Straight and endless?  - Gena became serious.  - Is it possible to automate everything and that they themselves should cope with their work? <br><br>  - Igor, you have been here for a long time.  Answer the man.  - looked at Igor Ivan. <br><br>  - Yes, I have a mess in my head ... - Igor started his worn record.  ‚ÄúYou mean that ...‚Äù <br><br>  - I mean, we have been working with bookkeeping for several years.  - Ivan did not let Igor finish speaking.  - There were periods when their activities were so automated that they did not require our participation at all.  You and I have halved the time of the closing period.  We made it so that a simple accountant could cope with the closing of the month, with no education even.  Dasha did it, remember? <br><br>  - Yes, I remember Dasha.  Soon, probably, from the decree will be released.  - Igor smiled. <br><br>  - She alone closed the month, in two accounts - both in the regulated and in the management.  There was friendship and love, between us and the accounting department. <br><br>  - And then what happened?  - Gena asked with a serious look. <br><br>  - Change of composition.  Not complete, but the chief accountant has changed, and the closure too.  And everything, again an old song - the programmer is needed to help the accountant, let him sit next to me, let him do what I say, at the first call should resort, work on weekends, especially during the closing period.  About the order heard? <br><br>  - What is the order?  - asked Stas. <br><br>  - Such that when drawing up the schedule of vacations of programmers it is necessary to take into account periods of closure.  July, October, and from January to April, we are no longer on vacation. <br><br>  - From January to April?  - Igor eyes rounded.  - Is it four months or something? <br><br>  - Yes, four months.  First, the closing of the fourth quarter, then - the closing of the year, then the closing of the first quarter, well, and there the payroll in April is rented. <br><br>  - Kick-ass ... - Stas muttered slowly. <br><br>  - This is the director said to you?  - Gena asked. <br><br>  - Yes, just now.  The chief accountant in his ear hooked, with their tax risks, so he fell for it. <br><br>  - Is it new?  - asked Igor. <br><br>  - Yes, a new one, which he himself brought here.  The creature is vile, damn it.  Each time the same thing as it got already.  The worst thing about a programmer‚Äôs life is a change of chief accountants and financial institutions.  Well, the directors. <br><br>  - Why?  - asked Gena.  - If everything is adjusted and automated. <br><br>  - With the degree of automation is generally not connected.  - Ivan answered. <br><br>  - That is, how is it not connected?  - Gene was surprised. <br><br>  - Damn, where have you been?  I just talked about how we automated bookkeeping so that there was only noise.  Generally, the participation of programmers was not required, and we quietly engaged in normal projects. <br><br>  - And what, the new composition of the accounting can not use the same system?  Or I do not understand.  - Gena was perplexed.  - Or has something changed in the process?  Or in the legislation? <br><br>  - Yes, a damn nowhere, nothing has changed, in the sense of the external environment.  But the chief accountant has changed, i.e.  replaced  And everything, a new broom, everything.  What the hell does an accountant have to sit, close a month, correct mistakes, draw minuses, reduce black and red?  If there are programmers. <br><br>  - And the director of something, do you agree?  - entered Igoryan. <br><br>  - I agree. <br><br>  - Why? <br><br>  - Because the chief accountant is his man.  That's all, that's why.  I explained everything to him, he told everything, he gave me calculations.  Well there, about the fact that a programmer of a company costs two to three times more expensive than an accountant, and in general it is impossible, not for that, programmers are needed to dig into the data.  Yes, by the way, I remembered - the package of checks was also told, that is, they were told to disconnect. <br><br>  - Which package?  The one on the primary?  - asked Stas. <br><br>  - Yes, which ensures the quality of the documents, so that later it closes faster, with a minimum of errors. <br><br>  - What motivated you?  - surprised Igor. <br><br>  - There is such a joke, motivated about it.  So motivated, so motivated ... - Ivan smiled.  - If it is serious, then it does not want new accounting to stumble upon checks when entering documents.  They want, as is customary in their race, to postpone everything for later.  Type we will close - then we'll figure it out.  Stas, turn off the package. <br><br>  - Right now ... - Stas turned to the computer, and began to start the system. <br><br>  - Although, wait ... - Ivan thought.  - No, do not turn it off yet.  We will not be quite so clearly, as they say, decompose ... If you get to the bottom, then turn it off.  Igor, are you on tech support? <br><br>  - Yes, I am this week. <br><br>  - In short, if they find out that the document is not being held due to a package of checks, turn it off.  Only not the whole package, but a specific check for a specific user.  It's a pity works, about two months all these errors were picked out, systematized, they were added to the package. <br><br>  - Well, I remember.  - said Igor.  - Valeria was so happy when all the mistakes were collected and blocked. <br><br>  - And at first, how much shout from her it was.  - Ivan smiled.  - I also resisted, stamped with my foot, that programmers should fix errors when the month is closed.  But nothing, then we talked to her a hundred times, I showed how it works - and I agreed.  Even helped. <br><br>  - A new, chief accountant in the sense?  - asked Gena. <br><br>  - What is the new chief accountant? <br><br>  - Well, maybe talk to her, she will also be filled. <br><br>  - It will penetrate, of course.  After a few months.  With all the new chief accountants, they come, they begin to put their retarded orders, to bend programmers through the director, to demand carte blanche for themselves, to restore order.  And then, when they get a little worse, and stop shaking for their place, carry out all their brains and imitation of vigorous activity ... Then they start thinking about the business, and not their career ambitions.  So it was with Valeria, and with this one, as hers, before she was ... Igoryan, what was her name? <br><br>  - Elena Vitalevna like ... Or Elena Viktorovna. <br><br>  - Elena Vitalyevna.  Also came, let's yell, threaten.  As she said there ... Somewhere even kept a quote from the correspondence ... Like, do not mess with me, you do not know me, you will get it sideways ... Something like that. <br><br>  - Kick.  - muttered Stas. <br><br>  - Your favorite word?  - Gene smiled. <br><br>  - No, I know just that, I have already seen it. <br><br>  - Yes, Stas saw.  When we worked at the poultry farm, we were in the same situation.  And it ended the same way - they poured, turned brown, quarreled, and then, after a few months, they began to work normally - and they, and we. <br><br>  - So maybe you just need to be patient?  - for the first time gave voice to Oleg.  - Since it is known for certain that this is for several months. <br><br>  - I'm tired, Olegon, to be honest.  - Ivan answered.  - This is an endless process.  And not only chief accountants concerned.  It is, of course, cyclical, a process, wave-like, like a roller coaster.  And there are joys in it, and there are sorrows, and even achievements - well, when it turns out another customer to return to normal work.  But then everything repeats again, with another moron who decides that the information technology department should work as a service and try to earn political points at the expense of us. <br><br>  - What to earn?  - asked Igor. <br><br>  - Political points.  Damn, Igor, in front of the authorities, in short, to show off.  In the same production.  Like, I'm good.  Before me was the boss - a moron.  Automation made retarded.  And I know how to.  Therefore, I will force programmers to do it right.  Well, it starts - projects that are not needed by anyone, taking up a lot of time, and leading to one result - new projects.  If before that the chief did not have time to drive out, for some shoals.  And projects serve as an excuse when jambs happen - it seems like they will do the automation, and then everything will be fine, and no one will be wrong, lose information, tasks and processes.  And when the project is completed, it turns out that it is not in the automation business, just the boss is a moron. <br><br>  - So it is everywhere like that.  - said Oleg.  - How many years work, almost always the case. <br><br>  - Well, I know.  - Ivan answered thoughtfully.  - But this is not an excuse? <br><br>  - What is not an excuse? <br><br>  - I do not want to live like this, continue to work like that, just because it is like that everywhere.  Do you understand? <br><br>  - Understand.  - Oleg poked his head and smiled. <br><br>  - He understands.  - Ivan smiled in response.  - You are a Siberian valenok. <br><br>  - Not Siberian, but Ural.  - Oleg laughed. <br><br>  - Yes, what's the difference ... In short, what you want, but I do not want to.  Need to come up with something. <br><br>  - We are with you!  - with a tense smile, Igor rose from his chair.  - And in the fire, and in the water! <br><br>  - Come on, help people, tech support ... - Ivan smiled. <br><br>  - ‚ÄúWho helps people, he spends time in vain.‚Äù  - Igor sang the famous song of the old woman Shapoklyak. <br><br>  - By the way.  The new director didn‚Äôt like these words, did you write them in Skype support status?  Get it out. <br><br>  - Damn, this was a good slogan for technical support.  - Igor skis. <br><br>  - I know that good, but clean, from sin ... <br><br>  - What we shall do?  - asked Gena, seeing that the conversation is nearing its end. <br><br>  - I do not know.  I have to think.  Sit, work. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/442188/">https://habr.com/ru/post/442188/</a></p>
