I collect observations, take notes on many topics that interest me.  Analyzing the records and thoughts of my mindmap on the topic of staff development, I understood, or rather, formulated that it does not suit me in our higher education.  Perhaps, in some universities (the honor and praise to them!) The situation is already changing - if in your university, dear Habra resident, this is not so - write down in comments with the name of the university and the city.  But in general‚Ä¶ <br><br>  <b>We are not taught ‚Äúhow‚Äù, we are taught ‚Äúsomething‚Äù.</b> <br><br>  Let me explain with examples.

      We are not taught to ‚Äúprogram in ABC language‚Äù, we are taught ‚Äúprogramming by the example of ABC language‚Äù.  We are not taught how to solve examples, we are taught ‚Äúmethods of integration‚Äù.  We are not taught how to ‚Äúplan‚Äù (activities, projects, vacations, a trip to another city, purchase), we are told or taught ‚Äúplanning‚Äù as a science or combination of methods, often indirectly instilling or cultivating the student habit of ‚Äúpostponing‚Äù and the duration of training cycles and the volume of iterations of training courses.  We are taught in drawing the ‚Äúconstruction of double penetration,‚Äù although for many this task is not invested in the head according to the mindset, acc.  it would be much cheaper and quicker to teach such a person to work with a system that would build such ‚Äúinsight‚Äù.  What lesson does the student make when deciding on the ‚Äútop three‚Äù another task for which there is no inner predisposition or inclination? .. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <i>For many of us, even with a diploma of higher technical education, the value of VAT (if VAT = 20%, as in Ukraine, for example) is the purchase amount divided by 5, not 6 - well, to whom, all these integration methods then surrendered ?</i> <br><br>  I remember very well how for almost a whole semester I learned how to manually optimize the model of tasks and resources, and only after a couple of years when I got down the steps to the managerial position I understood with the example of the Gant chart what it really was and I was very angry, knowing that this was done by clicking MS Project for a split second - the main thing is to understand what exactly you are pressing.  I do not want to exaggerate - there are tasks and whole courses that are needed in higher education and those buttons need to be ‚Äúprogrammed‚Äù by someone, but these people are 1-2% of those who have optimized this damn model with me.  It is impossible to pass in the university all practical tasks that in the future will be ‚Äúprogrammed‚Äù or ‚Äúcarried out under contracts‚Äù by an expert, cannot be.  Meanwhile, this is, perhaps, 90% of the time that the student sits on the bench. <br><br>  <i>Business, work and life are samples and search, and not the application of established laws.</i>  <i>And they do this business, those who try and experiment, and not those who have learned to "integrate" in universities.</i> <br><br>  I want it to be clear - I am not just another techie who advocates canceling or limiting hours, for example, humanitarian subjects for the sake of specialization: from my point of view, this is a limited approach that advocates of training ‚Äúnarrow-robots‚Äù sell.  No, I am convinced (seeing around myself those who have not received higher education) that such subjects as History, Cultural Studies, Sociology and Religious Studies are necessary in the program of higher educational institutions as expanding the world view and laying the foundations of a system of knowledge about the real world, which is necessary for any intelligent and educated person. <br><br>  I am very grateful to my teachers for the fundamental knowledge that they have put into my head with various methods, but - H-H-H-hell!  - to how many el-ee-n-a-n-a-n-s-s things had to get myself, waste time, nerves (myself, friends, colleagues, managers), instead of To pass several additional trainings (not even semester courses) literally for 2 days each, in the 3rd or 4th year of university.  Moreover, now, looking back at 6 years of study in one of the strongest universities of my country, I would readily have exchanged a dozen completely technical courses that I listened to at the time of watching some programs from the Discovery cycles or the task to read for several years. earlier some books. <br><br>  <b>There are things that we are not taught at all.</b> <br><br>  How to plan a career, how to manage time, how to manage money, how to negotiate, how to try and analyze the results of samples - and these are quite simple and fairly easy formalizable algorithmic things: do 1, 2.3, if 3 does not work yet, then 4 , 5, 6, or if 7 - get out of the algorithm.  We are not taught to set goals - in general, ‚Äútalk to the chef‚Äù and ‚Äúresolve the issue of salary‚Äù are somewhat different, after all things.  We are not taught to set goals at a higher or long-term level: what do I want from life?  And although these tasks are much more complicated, there are again quite simple methods that will help if you do not answer all vital questions at once, but they will teach you how to think, to answer these questions and not to replace them with any kind of erectile fillers.  The worst thing is that our parents were not taught this either, they cannot help with this, just as we cannot help our children with this if they do not teach us or life experience does not impart this knowledge to our heads.  Not vobob not broken, at the same time. <br><br>  <b>What is the outcome of such an approach in education?</b> <br><br>  By graduating and becoming a Specialist, yesterday's Student is not ready.  Neither to work, nor to an adult, or at least managed and planned life, nor to building a career, nor to further development.  To nothing.  He simply does not know how.  He was not taught these basic things, he was taught to integrate, translate, cause interruptions, calculate resistance, build diagrams, determine sociotypes, etc.  He was not taught to live and work. <br><br>  As a specialist, he works to live somehow: a car, an apartment, children - is also accepted, right?  Without having clear life plans (measured and endowed with resources), he either folds his arms and just floats, or just starts to want money, as the only measure of his success and ambitions.  At the same time, wanting and earning money (and many who want, sooner or later have money through N-shifts of work or hard cutting in one direction or through chance) often does not solve the problem of "solvency", causing an increase in the sums and the size of problems with their management. <br><br>  In their work, most of today's Specialists and Managers preach the principles of ‚Äúthey owe me‚Äù and justifying themselves ‚Äúthey didn‚Äôt give me‚Äù (just not understanding how else you can achieve something), ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have time to do anything‚Äù (without being able to manage myself and time), and why do I need all this? ‚Äù(not knowing how to set goals for themselves, and therefore, in fact, without understanding‚Äú how can I do it all ‚Äù),‚Äú somewhere further? .. no, I'd rather sit here again ‚Äù(without knowing what to want and how to manage a career, seeing it only as a ladder to the bubble), "I am surrounded by some idiots" (not understanding how to raise competence and control  Ruddle staff). <br><br>  <i>Loyalty to the company, corporate values, respect for colleagues?</i>  <i>What a fright from where?</i> <br><br>  <b>What to do?</b> <br><br>  Teach.  Open lessons.  Mandatory, classy reading (classroom, in the direct sense - reading at lectures, in class!).  Invite leading, successful people.  To speak and make to think, not to learn.  To put into the program short subjects-workshops such as ‚ÄúPlan the construction of a house‚Äù, ‚ÄúCome up with your working day in 5 years‚Äù, ‚ÄúRegister the family budget in Excel and plan the purchase of a car in 1 year‚Äù, etc.  To attract sponsors for such courses, to make them bright, memorable, to give the best real gifts such as laptops or trips abroad.  To teach not only in the university itself - to resume the summer practice at enterprises and at the level of the university to control these same enterprises.  Try other forms and formats of training (student startups, companies, projects with real money and real ‚Äúfirefighters‚Äù who can come to the office).  Try to learn shorter, faster, harder. <br><br>  <b>To learn to learn and to teach ‚Äúhow,‚Äù and not just ‚Äúsomething.‚Äù</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/81756/">https://habr.com/ru/post/81756/</a></p>
