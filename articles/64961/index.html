  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why did the United States and the USSR stop flying to the moon at the same time?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Exactly 40 years ago, on July 20, 1969, a team of American astronauts led by Neil Armstrong made their first flight to the Month. <br><br>  And yet I wonder why in 40 years there were no more flights? <br>  Why did the United States and the USSR stop flying to the moon at the same time? <br><br>  Even more incomprehensible was the further rejection of this method of research at all.  What is behind this decision?  Maybe someone's specific threat?  That we do not know.  However, the Americans soon stopped flying to the moon, although they seemed to be far from building a lunar town and a lunar cosmodrome ... Strange things are happening with Mars-launched vehicles.  The accuracy of the start and the possibility of adjusting the flight direction now seem to be things that are taken for granted.  However, one after another, the stations pass in an incredible distance from the destination, in another case, just before the most crucial moment (access to the planet), the connection suddenly disappears forever ... The Americans also felt this during the expeditions to Mars and Venus. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Something became clear after the revelations of the former employees of NASA - the famous space designer Maurice Chatelain, as well as Academician Berger and Professor Valle ... First published the book Our Ancestors from Space, and Professor and Academician - The Book of Secrets ... At one time there were theories (much of which was sucked from the finger) that lunar craters are former cities and other artificial structures.  We will not dwell on them, but the authoritative statement of the famous astronomer Sagan, made by him in the early 60s, is worth mentioning.  The scientist believed that the cavities found below the surface of the moon, one of which is 100 cubic kilometers (!), Are quite suitable for the existence and development of biological species. <br><br>  In 1963, American astronomers discovered giant luminous and moving objects on the moon, the dimensions of which are impressive: 5 kilometers long, 300 meters wide.  Such objects Flagstaff Observatory recorded 31!  And a lot of smaller objects.  However, back in 1968 (before the Apollo II flight), NASA itself published a handbook of lunar anomalies, which mentioned emerging and disappearing, by themselves, giant domes, craters, walls, trenches, moving geometric figures of various "colors" and so on. Further.  A total of 579 unexplained observations, an analysis of four-century work with the Moon by scientists and amateurs, are named.  The British astronomer Birt mentioned geometrical figures in 1871 in his own catalog of the mysteries of the Moon. <br><br>  Thus, after Neil Armstrong's memorable ‚Äúsmall step‚Äù, the Moon became not closer to us, but much further. <br><br>  - Government policies regarding keeping secret UFO truths from the general public are superbly described and documented in several books by famous astronomers, such as Allen Hynek (consultant on the UFO on the UFO problem), Major Donald Keyhoe ), Timothy Good (his book ‚ÄúTop Secret‚Äù) and many other professional researchers.  One of the undisputed experts we can trust is Christopher Kraft, former director of NASA.  He gave us the following entry (after leaving his post at NASA), made in Houston during the Apollo 11 lunar mission: <br><br>  ASTRONAUTH NEIL ARMSTRONG (NEIL ARMSTRONG) and BAZ OLDRIN (BUZZ ALDRIN) say from the moon: ‚ÄúThese are giant things.  No, no, no ... This is not an optical illusion.  There can be no doubt about that! ‚Äù <br><br>  FLIGHT MANAGEMENT (CENTER IN HOUSTON): ‚ÄúWhat ... what ... what?  What the hell is going on there?  What happened?" <br><br>  ASTRONAUTS: ‚ÄúThey are here below the surface.‚Äù <br><br>  FLIGHT MANAGEMENT: ‚ÄúWhat is there?  Communication was interrupted ... the control center calls Apollo 11. " <br><br>  ASTRONAUTS: ‚ÄúWe saw a few guests (visitors).  They were there for a while, checking the equipment. ‚Äú <br><br>  FLIGHT CONTROL: ‚ÄúRepeat your last message.‚Äù <br><br>  ASTRONAUTS: ‚ÄúI say that there are other spaceships here.  They are a straight line on the other side of the crater. ‚Äú <br><br>  FLIGHT CONTROL: ‚ÄúRepeat ... repeat!‚Äù <br><br>  ASTRONAUTS: ‚ÄúLet us probe this sphere ... 625 to 5 ... an automatic relay connected ... My hands are trembling so much that I cannot do anything.  Take it off?  Oh my god, if these damn cameras shoot something ... what then? ‚Äú <br><br>  FLIGHT CONTROL: ‚ÄúCan you shoot something?‚Äù <br><br>  ASTRONAUTS: ‚ÄúI no longer have a film on hand.  Three shots from the ‚Äúplate‚Äù, or whatever this thing is called, spoiled the film. ‚Äú <br><br>  FLIGHT CONTROL: ‚ÄúRestore control!  Are they in front of you?  Are there any noises from a UFO? ‚Äù <br><br>  ASTRONAUTS: ‚ÄúThey landed here!  They are here and they are watching us! ‚Äù <br><br>  FLIGHT CONTROL: ‚ÄúMirrors, mirrors ... can you adjust them?‚Äù <br><br>  ASTRONAUTS: ‚ÄúYes, they are in the right place.  But those who built these ships can arrive tomorrow and remove them.  Once and for all." <br><br>  It is logical that if government agencies have discovered secret UFO bases, then they must keep it secret from the public, and also develop a ‚Äúcover story‚Äù in order to hide the truth about the moon.  However, the problem was that the witnesses ‚Äúspoke‚Äù with our Department about the alien affairs. <br><br>  Among the experts who told us about life on the moon and astronaut discoveries were Farida Iskiovet, a former UFO consultant under the President of the United Nations, the mysterious Mr. English (mr. English), who took a completely secret photograph for NASA and lunar astronauts, former naval intelligence commander (Naval Intelligence) Mark Huber (Mark Huber), who knew a large amount of top secret data, Sergeant Willard Wannal (Willard Wannal), who served in military intelligence (Army Intelligence), major Major Wayne Aho (Wayne S. Aho) serving in military intelligence provided n  and consideration by Congress of research materials on UFOs, Dr. James Harra (dr. James Hurrah) from the NASA space program, and others who have secret tolerances.  I personally spoke with all the above-mentioned researchers. <br><br>  The heightened interest in life on the moon seized public opinion after radio messages about the experiences of Marconi Tesla (Marconi Tesla), who was trying to transmit radio signals to the Moon and get an answer to them, this was indeed the case.  After that, American, British and French astronomers reported flashes of light, flickering and even moving lights on the surface of the moon.  During the 20-30s, you can find numerous reports of such phenomena in various newspapers and magazines, which can still be found in libraries.  This interest reached its apogee when the prominent expert in air phenomena Palitzer Prize (Pulitzer Prize), who defeated astronomer John O'Neill (John O'Neill), publicly announced the discovery of a ‚Äúbridge‚Äù of artificial origin on the Moon.  There were other witnesses who observed the ‚Äúbridge‚Äù 12 miles long, which had not previously been in this place and which later disappeared for unknown reasons (was it too noticeable?).  This incident occurred in the early 1950s. <br><br>  Many astronauts Gemeny and Apollo told that they saw a UFO during their flights.  So, astronaut Gordon Cooper (Gordon Cooper) publicly admitted that he was observing a controlled vessel of extraterrestrial origin (we saw his photos of UFOs).  James McDivitt also took pictures of UFOs while weaving around the Earth, we saw them.  Orbital Earth and we saw them as well.  The Soviet space program in the 1960s, intended to establish a new record of time spent in orbit, was strangely interrupted after the ship took its position.  Private researchers with powerful radio equipment claimed that the Soviet cosmonauts were escorted into UFO orbit, who surrounded them and began to hurl them back and forth, as if the Soviet ship was a ball.  The astronauts, who were panicked, were ordered to immediately return to Earth. <br><br>  During the 50s, a large number of UFOs spotted on Earth were returning to the moon.  Their trajectories were tracked by secret government observation complexes located in the deserts of Arizona and Nevada, as well as in underground bases located inside the mountains.  WE HAVE A PHOTO OF A SHIP IN THE FORM OF A PLATE FLYING OVER THE SURFACE OF THE MOON, made by a civil astronomer.  Sergeant Willard Bathil, who was investigating the landing of a UFO in Oahu while serving in military intelligence, showed us 8 or 10 clear glossy photos of a silver spaceship hovering above the lunar surface.  Its dimensions were estimated at several miles and spoke for the fact that it is a SHIP-MAK (BASE SHIP) designed to transport many thousands of people between solar systems or galaxies for long periods of time in complete self-defense (autonomous mode)! <br><br>  In the period from 1950 to the 60s.  civilian astronomers observed new movements on the moon, light anomalies, and constant light sources, usually located inside craters, along with mysterious cruciform flashes. <br><br>  Soviet and American spacecraft (located on the Moon‚Äôs orbit) began photographing mysterious structures on the Moon discovered by NASA.  There were scholars such as Fred Steckling, who demanded an explanation from the so-called ‚Äúcivil agency‚Äù.  It's amazing how NASA could release these photos WITHOUT COMMENTS!  Many structures could only be noticeable at higher magnifications. <br><br>  The American spacecraft RANGER II sent 200 photographs of the craters of the Moon with domes inside.  These domes were not new.  They were reported in the media by French astronomers about 48 years ago.  33 photos of the dome on the moon sent by Lunar Orbitter 2 were released without comment in Washington DC in 1967. On July 1, 1966, NASA in the media officially acknowledged that astronauts saw a UFO, however, later refuted this information (for those who collect official reports UFOs will not be difficult to find a large number of contradictory statements proving the concealment of the truth).  All this did not stop astronaut Gordon Cooper from a public statement: ‚ÄúI believe in aliens because I saw their spacecraft with my own eyes‚Äù (during the flight of Gemeni 16).  Our Blair cuspids file has photographs taken from lunar satellites that show weird spiers that form regular geometric shapes.  A tall white spire, similar to a Washington monument, was photographed on the surface of the moon along with mysterious straight paths or tracks that pass without turning through craters, hills, valleys and piles of stones.  Some of the domes had flashing lights. <br><br>  A few photos of NASA that we were able to see showed a long cigar-shaped object lying on the surface of the moon, which was later absent in other photos.  We saw a picture of the pyramid on the dark side (back side).  The DARK SIDE is always hidden from our eyes and telescopes and, obviously, is the ideal place for aliens to build a secret spaceport.  The lack of atmosphere is not a problem when we think of domes with an artificial environment.  Even NASA recognizes that scientists have technology (but not billions of dollars) for building underground bases with artificial air conditioning, like the ones the military is building for themselves. <br><br>  Astronaut Edward Mitchell (Edgar Mitchell) confidentially told Farida Iskiovet, a representative of our Department, that he had seen a UFO on the Moon. <br><br>  In 1978, a mysterious, stocky man with the appearance of a typical agent, appeared in Maui, calling himself Mr.  English.  I cannot give his full name.  He had NASA HIGHER LEVEL security clearance.  He told me that he was a full-time photographer in the Apollo program, photographed the wreckage of a crashed disk in a hangar at a secret air force base in Texas, saw a UFO while astronauts were flying.  He gave us a large amount of data on UFOs and admitted that astronauts did see a spacecraft on the moon, and also confirmed the fact that the moon was used by UFOs. <br><br>  <a href="http://werter.org.ua/2009/07/20/chomu-ssha-i-srsr-odnochasno-prypynyly-poloty-na-misyats/">Source</a> (translated into Russian) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/64961/">https://habr.com/ru/post/64961/</a></p>
