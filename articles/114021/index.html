  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Illusionist. Graphic magic</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/783/b45/23d/783b4523dd03b8db101ff02d6591cf0c.jpg"><br>  More recently, the brilliant French cartoon "The Illusionist" died down in Russian cinemas.  I found out about him about a year ago when I talked about <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/3d_graphics/92225/">Secret of Kells</a> and since then I could not wait.  What do they have in common?  Perhaps only the reverent attitude of their creators to their creation, and in particular to the graphics. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In each scene, you can see accuracy and love.  All of them are worked out to the smallest detail.  There is no hack, there is not what is done to untie it.  Many points could be cut - they do not carry the semantic load.  For example, walking on the pavement lady with a dog.  She was shown just like that, and if she were not there, no one would have noticed.  But she was and it gives off so warm.  Such details draw attention to themselves and you just understand that you fall in love with these crooked streets, dilapidated rooms of hotels, a blinking sign, and dreary everyday life turns into a fairy tale. <br>  The atmosphere of any scene is not just because it is needed, as is often done in modern cartoons, it creates an atmosphere.  A recent Russian cartoon comes to mind - something from the episode about the heroes.  There was a beautiful course - a huge carpet with a map of the country, on which the king watched the state of affairs.  And only this attention was paid to this carpet.  All other decorations only indicated the time and place.  Not a single detail, extra chair, cracks in the window.  Dry and straight.  Anything that does not concern the plot is superfluous.  In "The Illusionist" you can endlessly examine the details: folds on the dress, hanger in the dressing room and scattered boxes in the same place, glare on the window, faces of the characters.  It's like comparing a dry office calendar and a picture. <br>  Individual words deserve heroes.  Returning to the ‚ÄúSecret of Kells‚Äù, we can say that the characters are drawn in a primitive style.  Their faces express, of course, the inner world, but this does not make them expressive.  And in the film under discussion, each person is a story.  The faces and body of their caricature.  By this it is immediately clear that he is a drunkard, and this businessman, the third one is a prank, and the fourth is a dandy.  And their characters, behavior ?!  Animators to work well.  They have so much liveliness and subtext - I want to look without stopping. <br>  The film is imbued with subtle and not very humor, kindness and hidden emotions.  Why hidden?  Because, for the most part, emotions have to be guessed and judged only by the behavior of the characters - there are practically no words.  Dialogues are very short and therefore understandable.  This makes the movie spice.  Therefore, I advise you to look in the original. <br>  As for the plot, now you yourself will be able to learn it by looking at this wonderful cartoon.  This is a sad story about acute need, about an old illusionist-loser and a girl who believed in magic.  Despite all the hardships, he did his main miracle in life, thereby marking his departure from the scene.  A curtain. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> <b><br></b>  The Illusionist. <br>  Directed by Sylvain Chomet. <br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0775489/">www.imdb.com/title/tt0775489</a> </div>
