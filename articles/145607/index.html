      <br>
      Traditionally, the Summit is held in San Francisco, where one of the company's offices is located, and this year I visited it for the first time.  I want to share with you a little news from the world of Atlassian, and just impressions. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I got to the Summit, I can say, ‚Äúfor free‚Äù.  Last year, Atlassian held a <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/en/task-master-challenge/">Bamboo Task Master</a> contest, which involved writing extensions for Bamboo, the Continuous Integration system.  And I (with the invaluable help of my colleagues) won this competition with the <a href="http://stiltsoft.com/bamboo-vmware/index.html">Bamboo VMWare Plugin</a> , which allows you to start and stop virtual machines with test benches before and after assembly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/58f/a34/89c/58fa3489ce1661cde6c04256024574fb.png"><br><br>  Of course, the cost of attending the Summit is significantly less than the cost of travel and accommodation, but still nice :) <br><br>  The summit was held for 3 days - from May 30th to June 1st.  The first day was devoted to training and informal acquaintance, and the remaining two days were held under the banner of reports and lightning talk (short but useful presentations). <br><br>  An event was held at the <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/K6FM">Concourse Exhibition Center</a> , which, by the way, is located near the Atlassian office.  The weather was quite warm, but the incessant wind was a little unnerving. <br><br><h3>  The first day </h3><br>  I did not attend trainings (they were more focused on beginners), so on the first day after a walk through San Francisco I went straight to registration. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/665/5eb/de2/6655ebde22c711ac647b3a51c8c74f92.jpg"><br><br>  At registration a very convenient badge was issued, inside which the program of the event was packed, which perfectly saved from having to dig into the bag in search of a schedule.  And, of course, the badge was two-sided, so it was not necessary to think, and if he had not turned over to the interlocutor with an empty side.  Organizers of local conferences, shake a whisker! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/be1/c9d/75b/be1c9d75becb04e781352499e6775f3f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/163/d6d/dd6/163d6ddd652e331898f3bdbd4f78a78a.jpg"><br><br>  Immediately after registration, a guest package was issued, inside which a thermos with the logo of one of the sponsors was revealed, a thermos-mug with the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a> logo and a little bit of every little thing.  By the way, on the way back, I was even a bit worried that the American border guards would not take a shell-like thermos at the airport for ‚Äúscanning‚Äù my bag for something else, but it cost. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0a4/b27/4bd/0a4b274bd121c77825f47563995210fb.jpg"><br><br>  The first day was remembered by communication with sponsors, whose ‚Äúbooths‚Äù were forced into the central part of the exhibition complex, as well as communication with colleagues and users.  Although someone he probably more remembered freebie sushi. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1c2/6cd/53d/1c26cd53db9979cd8cf3ccc1a363035a.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, from the territory of the former Soviet Union there were St. Petersburg colleagues from <a href="http://almworks.com/index.html">ALMWorks</a> , whose stand enjoyed quite good popularity.  Well, if someone else was there from the Russian-speaking population, then check in the comments, it will be interesting to hear your opinion. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b39/804/146/b398041466cd999b6f586936330fca3a.jpg"><br><br>  After the "semi-official" opening was followed by a completely unofficial part in the form of a party in one of the nearby bars, again organized by one of the sponsors.  I did not stay at this party for a long time, because there is so much health, and soon I went for a walk and rest before the next day. <br><br><h3>  Second day </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/148/6c5/03c/1486c503c9a21d0d2077e5f67961faf4.jpg"><br><br>  The second day of the Summit was opened by one of the founders of Atlassian Mike Cannon-Brookes. <br><br>  He told about the new strategy for Enterprise clients.  Atlassian has finally begun to provide fast and 24/7 support for large and sluggish customers.  OnDemand boasted of their cloud service of their own applications, which since the announcement last fall has already gathered almost a million users. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4ec/1ef/3b3/4ec1ef3b3cbd551e3e9b54aa15aaf580.jpg"><br><br>  We were also pleased by the news that JIRA 5.1 coming out soon will be even faster than 5.0.  A performance gain relative to 4.4 is expected almost 2.5 times. <br><br>  <a href="https://marketplace.atlassian.com/">Atlassian Marketplace</a> was officially introduced, which is essentially a continuation of the Plugin Exchange, a service for posting and downloading plug-ins, but with the convenient opportunity to sell its commercial plug-ins right there.  By the way, the ability to use a ready-made licensing system and payment will cost the developer 25% of the money earned.  This is less than in the AppStore or GooglePlay, but still noticeable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/65d/e41/3ef/65de413ef9e2221aed6711a0d160037f.jpg"><br><br>  Spoon (and someone and scoop) tar in this situation will seem that Marketplace does <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/licensing/marketplace">not</a> work <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/licensing/marketplace">with all countries</a> .  And of course, exUSSR left behind.  On the sidelines, Atlassian representatives boasted that they still work with countries where 95% of customers are located, and to the question "when it will be with us," they threw up their arms and answered "when they no longer require you to print on each piece of paper." <br><br>  But enough about the sad.  During its existence on the Exchange / Marketplace, more than a thousand plug-ins have been downloaded and three million downloads of plug-ins by users have been made.  59 (and probably more) of all the plug-ins are already available for purchase through the new Marketplace.  For <s>western</s> ordinary users, Marketplace will provide an opportunity to ‚Äúsynchronize‚Äù all their licenses so that you can pay for all products and plugins at the same time, rather than throughout the year. <br><br>  Among other things, Mike boasted that the company has already grown to 500 people and continues to gain momentum.  Atlassian is not the first year on the market, and I think it will not be difficult for them to overcome the next growth problems. <br><br>  After Mike, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Ma">Jeff Ma</a> spoke, known for being in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_Blackjack_Team">MIT Blackjack Team</a> , who, with the help of her mind, left the casino (no, not intelligent, ordinary) without money.  Even now I find it difficult to say what main idea I wanted to convey to Jeff (probably the fact that the team is cool), but it was very interesting to listen to him. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d14/447/18d/d1444718dc54e19475fbe48b2f1e9d32.jpg"><br><br>  After Jeff, we were told a little more about the upcoming Confluence 4.3.  In this version, there are new notifications in real time right on the page, thanks to which you do not need to climb into the mail and watch what is happening.  There was a simple but nice opportunity to keep lists of tasks - both personal user and general on the page, in the form of a check list.  There is a new mobile version of Confluence, which, in essence, is that mobile devices are given a specially reformatted page, where unnecessary elements are removed, fonts are enlarged, and pictures and tables are stretched across the width of the screen.  It looked pretty good. <br><br>  Currently you can download <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/download-eap">4.3 EAP</a> (Early Access Program) and read the current version of <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Confluence%2B4.3-m11%2BEAP%2BRelease%2BNotes">release notes</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f66/3f5/6e5/f663f56e51448099b7d02f087221a2b7.png"><br><br>  Then came the turn of the event called Launchpad, in which the sponsors had 5 minutes to tell their audience about the product.  And the auditor gave the speakers instant feedback immediately after the report by voting via SMS or online.  The hall was torn apart, as was to be expected, the performances that had the most non-standard design - <a href="http://www.gliffy.com/">Gliffy</a> had pirates, <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4a3/700/a78/4a3700a787e5490cae9d6109f7b4cf43.jpg"><br><br>  and <a href="http://www.stepstonetech.com/display/zen/Home">Stepstone</a> (Zen Foundation) complained of a hard life in a straitjacket. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/70e/812/f4c/70e812f4c7eb147e00a987d90318485a.jpg"><br><br>  Although it should be noted that some of the sponsors perceived the Summit as an occasion <s>to read on a piece of paper</s> tedious and without a flash to talk about their product.  So for some of them the number of customers could even be reduced. <br><br>  Then dinner came, at which Atlassian arrived in an original way and drove several so-called Food trucks in the city‚Äôs fast-food chains to the building.  By the way, fast absolutely did not mean poor quality or tasteless.  And the place for communication turned out quite good. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d91/abb/5e8/d91abb5e8e90c0e3202ae05284b807c8.jpg"><br><br>  And upon closer inspection, the ‚Äúinconspicuous‚Äù <a href="https://zynga.com/">Zynga</a> office was found nearby. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b12/f03/a6e/b12f03a6efc495288f8e90c9ac4bd8be.jpg"><br><br>  After lunch, I was mainly in the sections dedicated to Confluence, and I learned that 4.3 promises a built-in table sorting, according to which people suffer a lot, starting with 4.0.  And, finally, drag'n'drop pictures and macros on the page.  There was also a discussion about the ‚Äúinstant editor‚Äù that will open without reloading the page (as in 4.2 made for comments), but I haven‚Äôt yet seen this in 4.3 EAP.  Perhaps it was just "thinking out loud." <br><br>  Then I moved on to another of my favorite sections - plug-in development, but there were already discussed things with which to ship the public does not make much sense.  If anyone interstsya with this, then I will tell in the comments or in PM. <br><br>  On the second floor of the exhibition center, there was a so-called AtlasBar, where everyone could approach the Atlassian staff and consult on issues of interest to them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7fe/4c3/39d/7fe4c339d1c50541fff9352f9b6f298b.jpg"><br><br>  The second day ended with another party in the Embarcadero area near the bay. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4e1/d5c/1ab/4e1d5c1abc4ac0a0d22304f5d62e6a3f.jpg"><br><br><h3>  Third day </h3><br>  The next day showed that the party was good, although over time the people pulled up enough. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a64/6b4/17f/a646b417f5c1c0396859ebb45df61a38.jpg"><br><br>  This day began with a speech by the second founder of Atlassian - Scott Farquhar. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b12/a5f/ea3/b12a5fea3869175ca0cdc1da0efead58.jpg"><br><br>  It was immediately reported that the Atlassian initiative called <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/fedex">FedEx Days</a> , under which willing employees (and now not only employees) were given 24 hours of time to implement their any idea, changes its name.  At the request of someone who changes the name is quite obvious, but it is surprising that this name lasted for so long without claims of the copyright holder.  The new name gives originality and sounds like ShipItDays. <br><br>  Then Scott drew attention to the growing popularity of DVCS.  For example, according to surveys, last year, 19% of Atlassian customers used DVCS, up from 48% this year.  Naturally, <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/stash/overview">Stash</a> was immediately presented - a system for managing Git repositories inside the enterprise. <br><br>  Then GreenHopper 5.10 (a plug-in that adds Agile to JIRA) and JIRA 5.1 goodies were presented.  Of the possibilities visible to the simple user, there will be inline-editing for virtually all the displayed fields, and now it will not be necessary to change to one value to run into the edit mode and back. <br><br>  Of the innovations of GreenHopper 5.10, which were described in one of the following reports, it is necessary to note the multi-design - now on one ‚Äúboard‚Äù and in one sprint it will be possible to work with applications from different projects.  Plus Rapid board is now becoming the main, and the current is becoming an additional called Classic board.  From small, but convenient features - dots display the number of days that the application hangs on the "board". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b39/d9a/73f/b39d9a73f5f2899f72da25d9ff309cbc.jpg"><br><br>  It was also very cool to watch a comrade from <a href="http://www.rallydev.com/">Rally</a> sitting nearby and carefully taking notes :) <br><br>  And in between reports I managed to catch one of the founders of Atlassian and chat with him a little. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/961/314/09f/96131409f738076631a176e7fd8d8118.jpg"><br><br>  Of the rest of the reports on this day, you can note <br><br>  <strong>From 0 - 100 Million with No Salespeople</strong> .  Not new, but a useful idea that every employee of the company should be at least a little seller.  But do not push the product to friends, like <s>Oriflame, the</s> bigwigs of the network business, but to bring people information about their company and what interesting things they do.  Atlassian, for example, has no sellers in the classic sense of the word;  Nobody calls and writes to customers to buy a product.  There is only a marketing team and an electronic system for selling products on the site.  The customer always comes for the purchase. <br><br>  <strong>Minecraft and JIRA: Behind the Scenes</strong> .  Atlassian's Joe Clark has integrated JIRA and <a href="http://www.minecraft.net/">Minecraft</a> .  Although at first glance this occupation is useless, it added many minutes of life to laughing listeners and unobtrusively introduced the <a href="http://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/latest/">JIRA REST API</a> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/hMRmOIGaFnw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjcmPTQPR8oSMadXIgCf-1-n33S9w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <strong>How to Survive a Zombie Apocalypse (Or Any Other Natural Disaster) Using JIRA</strong> .  I remember that in the company of the speaker there is a ‚Äúflash drive on duty‚Äù with a JIRA installed there and a work plan in it in case of any unforeseen cataclysm, as a result of which the local network will fail.  Naturally, if the network and the server remains to work, the same plan is in the regular JIRA. <br><br>  <strong>Workflow Magic</strong> .  They told about the <a href="https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.atlassian.jira.plugins.jira-workflow-sharing-plugin">JIRA Workflow Sharing Plugin</a> , which relieves administrators of a headache when transferring a workflow (with all the things attached to it) from one JIRA installation to another. <br><br>  <strong>A session of questions with Eric Ries, the author of the book Lean Startup</strong> .  The main conclusion: no one canceled to learn. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/26a/466/3da/26a4663da74b51a75fee8c8b511cce6f.jpg"><br><br>  In general, videos of all reports promise to post on the Web, so that those who wish can learn what interested them in more detail. <br><br>  The last day ended with a party of Atlassian Experts - Atlassian authorized partners who provide support, sale of licenses, customization and so on for end customers.  And I got there due to the fact that <a href="http://stiltsoft.com/">our small company</a> literally just before the Summit received the status of an Expert.  The atmosphere was quite interesting and friendly, although most of the Experts and a bunch of their companies, because of which I, as a newcomer, in these series was difficult, although the event still very much. <br><br>  At the same time, I bow out and leave to write a post about visiting the Atlassian office, where everyone was invited on an excursion after the Summit. <br><br>  See you again! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e59/ab8/982/e59ab8982675453355f947c588bf02dc.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/145607/">https://habr.com/ru/post/145607/</a></p>
