Solutions that can replace imports come to the fore. <br><br>  Vladimir Kolganov, Head of Storage at CROC, reports: <br>  ‚ÄúFor our part, we are exploring the market, selecting working options with a replacement potential.  So, in the past year alone, about six solutions from various Russian and Eastern manufacturers have been tested in our laboratory. " <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      According to Vladimir Kolganov, one of the most promising solutions for the implementation of cloud infrastructures is the software and hardware complex of the RCNTEK company - the Resilient Cloud Storage system.  CROC will use this system in its projects for equipping Russian enterprises with advanced IT solutions and replacing imported software and hardware in this area.  What is unique in it, and why is this system that received such a high appreciation of the largest system integrator? <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/30a/730/071/30a73007176f618b43416fc59f59e522.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Enterprise-class data storage system Resilient Cloud Storage is an advanced and fully Russian development, functional and relevant, especially in the light of the course on import substitution. <br><br>  RCS is an elastic system that has the ability to scale up to hundreds of petabytes with linear performance growth as volumes grow, self-healing, and also supports modern protocols such as S3 and RBD, which allows for better, simpler and more efficient storage and operation with large amounts of data. <br><br>  The key advantage of Storage Resilient Cloud Storage is the ability to scale to hundreds of Petabytes within a single storage system.  This is achieved through a unique solution architecture, in which there are no dedicated storage controllers, which always have a limit on performance, the number of supported disk shelves and interfaces for communication with the outside world, which creates a ‚Äúbottleneck‚Äù effect when working with data.  In Resilient Cloud Storage, the controller is built into each disk module, thereby ensuring the ability to work with huge amounts of data without losing the performance of the entire system.  With the addition of new disk modules, both storage capacity and performance increase linearly. <br><br>  No less important advantage of the system is its reliability.  Data is three times reserved, RCS clients interact directly with storage modules, and dedicated resource groups are provided for priority high-load applications.  In addition, RCS has the function of restoring and automatically balancing data.  When a disk or a module fails, the system will be restored automatically, re-creating redundancy in free space with minimal performance degradation.  When adding new modules, data is automatically balanced. <br><br>  Denis Neshtun, CEO of RCNTEK, talks about ‚Äúhis offspring‚Äù: <br>  ‚ÄúResilient Cloud Storage is the flagship product of RCNTEC, focused on large corporations, private and public projects that need real cloud scalability to solve problems, but which need to be provided in the best way within their own cloud in their data centers.  CROC is a leading player in the IT market in Russia, and, of course, has extensive experience, including building storage infrastructure at large enterprises in our country.  We know that for its projects, CROC chooses only the best solutions and is proud to become partners.  We are confident that our system will occupy a worthy place in the product line that CROC offers to clients. ‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/303012/">https://habr.com/ru/post/303012/</a></p>
