  <section class="page js-page"><h1>New kind of competition among mobile applications</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Before enemies seemed obvious, here is your market, here are the players.  You calmly cut your cake, not too distracted by the outside world.  Cute spiders in a can.  Now it's a little different. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  There are still sizes of the market.  If players enter the expanding market, then, of course, it is more important to think about the growth of the market as a whole, than about its share in it.  She must come next.  It‚Äôs harder to lure from a competitor than to get a new customer who first encountered your product. <br><br>  Let's now take a look at a mobile phone, there is an average of 20 to 50 applications.  Some of them are vital.  Most applications are set to look.  If your application does not need a user like air, then chances are that they will forget about you.  Installed, forgot, cleaned, demolished.

      Here begins the competition for the user's attention.  We need to get through to it between twitter, evil birds and mail to remind ourselves.  How do you compete with applications on the desktop to get a few minutes of user attention. <br><br>  You need to carefully remind yourself to get a chance for a second meeting with the user, and not instantaneous demolition for spam. <br><br>  So first of all, how can you remind about yourself.  It is now almost independent of the OSes in the mobile: <br>  Release a new version.  Dear way, because besides the reminder, you also need functionality for the new version. <br>  Push notification in the notification center / application itself. <br>  If the application requires a login, you can remind of the left mail or account on fb or twitter. <br><br>  Note that notifications must be provided in advance.  Usually this function, if it is not the main one, is thrown out of the first release.  This is partly justified, since the first time you can remind the update.  On the other hand, it can be risky, the second release can be delayed, and the application does not fly. <br><br>  And so now you can think of what we will remind of ourselves. <br><ul><li>  You can help the user, prompt.  This applies to ‚Äúuseful‚Äù applications. <br>  For news - give a lightning about a serious event, for different maps and navigators - warn about huge traffic jams in the city, weather - warn about a cold snap or rain tomorrow. <br></li><li>  Laugh if you can, a great way.  Only the reason should be really fun.  Good for gaming and entertainment applications. <br></li><li>  Give a discount, for example, dictionaries for the translator are only sold today at 0.09 bucks. </li><li>  If your application involves sharing of information, make a selection of the best posts, pictures, anything for a month.  Let the user see that there is life in the application and it is so interesting. </li></ul><br><br>  Total: <br><ul><li>  For novice applications, it is very important to get a second and third chance from the user.  Sleeping audience of the application after 2-3 months from launch can be very large.  Calculate the installation base minus active monthly users. <br></li><li>  The second is easy to get, but think about how you can be useful or interesting to your user.  In this case, there will be the next time. <br></li><li>  You risk for intrusiveness, you can immediately be removed.  Do not abuse notifications.  You do not need to wake the user often.  Give the opportunity to disable these messages. <br></li></ul><br>  I think that for the team launching a new product it will be very useful to think on this topic. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/138907/">https://habr.com/ru/post/138907/</a></p>
