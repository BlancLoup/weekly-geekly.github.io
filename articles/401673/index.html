Headphones of the average price range are always of the greatest interest, and not at all because they are cheaper than premium models (although that is why they are also cunning).  If, in quite budgetary options, manufacturers tend to save on everything, then here, in an effort to achieve the optimal ratio of price and quality, they use better materials and advanced solutions.  After all, one goal - to stay affordable, but to do everything on the level. <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/hfhe/blog/285998/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/41d/f56/86d/41df5686d9e14317110466efc8b06d04.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Therefore, headphones in this range from the company with, to put it mildly, the loud name of Audio-Technica simply cannot be missed.  <a href="http://www.audio-technica.ru/search/%3Fsearch%3DATH-MSR7NC">We</a> will tell you about the price of the <a href="http://www.audio-technica.ru/search/%3Fsearch%3DATH-MSR7NC">ATH-MSR7NC</a> later, but it will surely surprise you pleasantly. <br><br>  Over the 55-year-old (yes-yes) story, the name Audio-Technica has almost become a common name - the company has an incredible baggage of merit, ranging from the legendary ATH-M50 headphones to limited premium models, the cost of which many still cannot justify.  Audio-Technica started its business in Tokyo, selling sound pickups for records, by 1978 got to the microphone market with the AT-800 series, and four years earlier released the AT-700 dynamic headphone line.  Marketing for her has always been in the first place, unlike you know who: you are a serious company with a research center.

Last well, really lacked in the predecessor ATH-MSR7.  But first things first. <br><br><h2>  Equipment </h2><br>  A black box with a blue tint looks modest - there are no plastic or wooden cases here, but we are not buying a box, but what‚Äôs inside.  And there behind the silky cloth are not only the headphones themselves, which for the time being are set aside, but also the box with the accessories right below them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cb9/068/051/cb9068051009130d5435321217988ad6.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c62/26b/fd7/c6226bfd748dca5eb8139bb489139a59.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/302/666/c66/302666c66741466d35b3bf98bdc83583.jpg"><br><br>  Included are three cables - the usual length of 1.2 m and another one with a headset remote control.  Another USB wiring, micro USB, is used to charge the battery of the noise cancellation system.  And, of course, the branded leather case has not gone anywhere.  I would probably like another adapter from 3.5 mm to 6.3 mm, but the manufacturer seems to be positioning the headphones more for portable technology. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b92/432/ea1/b92432ea1c07fb09629ae9c9ed870013.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/679/6f7/089/6796f708995b8b5d36f6105e2f0530e1.jpg"><br><br>  But the aircraft adapter in the kit still put - apparently, active noise cancellation requires.  Like, fly, check, we are not afraid. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/afe/ef4/d82/afeef4d8293d5d888365c83c0b3b6473.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Appearance and design </h2><br>  The workmanship is pleasantly surprising, as is the reliability - everything is fitted and assembled into a solid top five with a plus, a lot of metal is used in the design of the headphones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bd0/2cb/32b/bd02cb32b953ef48be6bd5291a1cda5f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/95b/3c8/24f/95b3c824ff8dffd869ef54f3cd5f1afd.jpg"><br><br>  Headphone cups comfortably rotate around the axes, cable and ear cushions are replaced, which allows you to extend the time the headphones are in use.  Headband and ear cushions are made of soft eco-leather with a filling of a material with a memory effect.  They sit comfortably on their heads, since the MSR7 had an excessive downforce, the manufacturer softened them to a comfortable value.  In the last model, this was done to ensure good sound insulation, but here it was compensated by noise reduction.  "Fit" headphones for themselves, of course, have to, but for your own comfort. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0b2/bb0/e82/0b2bb0e82681c25690acf4c1b13670ea.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/486/7cf/2cb/4867cf2cb12a67b8ce6b0fd0e3e8b34b.jpg"><br><br>  Under the left cup is the micro-USB port for charging the NC battery, a 3.5 mm jack and, yes, a switch to activate the active noise cancellation system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f52/d93/6ce/f52d936ce2f6b62edaac630be8fa02cf.jpg"><br><br>  The closed design of the MSR7NC, although it looks massive, is in fact very comfortable.  With a long carrying ears can sweat a little - minus in the eco-leather piggy bank.  However, for each person it will be individually. <br><br><h2>  <a href="http://www.audio-technica.ru/search/%3Fsearch%3DATH-MSR7NC">MSR7NC specifications</a> </h2><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  Type of <br></td><td>  Dynamic, overhead <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Acoustic design <br></td><td>  Closed <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Connection <br></td><td>  Wired <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Driver <br></td><td>  True motion Hi-Res Audio 45 mm <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Sensitivity <br></td><td>  97/104 dB <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Impedance <br></td><td>  30/150 ohm <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Frequency range <br></td><td>  5 - 40,000 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Noise suppression <br></td><td>  Active, two microphones <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Autonomous work (noise reduction) <br></td><td>  30 hours <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Connector <br></td><td>  3.5 mm <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Microphone <br></td><td>  Condenser 50 Hz - 4000 Hz <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Weight <br></td><td>  305 g <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  Compared to MSR7, the driver has not changed - the same Hi-Res Audio with a 45 mm aperture diameter with the marketing name True Motion.  The design has damping inserts, the voice coil is lightweight, due to which the emitter instantly recognizes the change in voltage.  From here we have an equal frequency response. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a63/1be/355/a631be355dd0f3d1e7328d5a55b5b1e1.jpg"><br><br>  The active noise cancellation system here deserves special attention.  Why is it here? It is clear what kind of Hi-Res will be fully revealed without noise suppression.  The system provides two microphones, both are outside the cups.  Active noise cancellation is achieved by overlapping out of phase with the captured microphone noise on the music signal.  Usually, the microphone is placed inside the cups - thus eliminating noise that the passive barrier did not keep, or two microphones per channel (one inside, the other outside).  The hero of this review has only microphones outside: it‚Äôs not entirely clear what the specific advantage of such a solution is.  In marketing manuals, they talk about proprietary technologies and capturing noise from all directions.  Below we tell whether this is in fact. <br><br>  For active noise cancellation, a built-in battery is used, which can work up to 30 hours from a single charge.  We managed to reach 28 hours, which, however, is also very good.  Charging with a USB cable - micro-USB takes about four hours. <br><br><h2>  Sound </h2><br>  We will not tell about the dense "bottoms" and bright mids - the perception of sound is purely individual, and what may seem like a "deep" bass to one will not be appreciated by the other.  As they say, you should not look for a violinist in the third row, if only keyboard players are sitting there.  We confine ourselves to the fact that the vocals are the forte of ATH-MSR7NC, there is no point in arguing with this.  And the sound of these headphones is far from being 18-20 thousand rubles (yes, we will finally give out their price), but for all 50, both from 16 bits / 44.1 kHz, and in Hi-Res 24 bits / 96- 192 kHz.  Fortunately there is something to compare. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e14/259/632/e142596323816f334787c8a31e2383c2.jpg"><br><br>  It is much more interesting to talk about the noise reduction system.  According to the manufacturer, in the active mode, the sensitivity of the headphones is increased from 97 to 104 dB, in fact, the growth is not so significant.  The main thing that you fear in the presence of a noise cancellation system is that it can cause harmonic and frequency distortions.  Here it is not.  <a href="http://www.audio-technica.ru/search/%3Fsearch%3DATH-MSR7NC">NC</a> copes with its tasks perfectly, and on the street even the passive barrier shows itself from the best side.  In the subway you can go down with these headphones, but not too often, so as not to spoil your impression.  With regard to use in everyday noisy conditions (at home near the TV, in openspace, in a cafe behind a laptop), the active system becomes the cherry on the cake, which MSR7 lacked. <br><br>  Even better, graphics will tell everyone for us - for example, the frequency response with active and passive noise reduction systems. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4b0/3d8/73c/4b03d873cae322b6a76efbf0db9d6271.jpg"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Active</font></i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cda/159/d1e/cda159d1e1f43a9b99f50c5c7d98e421.jpg"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Passive</font></i> <br><br>  And a couple more useful graphs-comparisons of headphones with active and passive noise reduction system. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b5f/550/c6f/b5f550c6f94f392373728d26ec0c6310.jpg"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Active</font></i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f32/f9f/300/f32f9f3005068e0fa5d0dfdee89696af.jpg"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Passive</font></i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6ab/75a/ca4/6ab75aca43895f8037438f177e03b1cf.jpg"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Active</font></i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d4b/e02/291/d4be02291da4f84a6dda27d57b15eb0a.jpg"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Passive</font></i> <br><br>  It could have been limited to listening to headphones on a MacBook, iPhone and Cowon PLENUE S ( <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/hfhe/blog/">reviewed in a blog at Geektimes</a> ), but decided to go further - they connected it to the KURZWEIL MPG-200 digital piano.  Someone will say "nonsense, there is nothing cooler than the classics," but which side to look at.  We got an adapter for 6.3 mm (every audiophile has at least two in the stash), and it went. <br><br>  The ‚ÄúSpanish folies‚Äù of Scarlatti were played for an hour, and each time it was amazing how the headphones could produce such a sound.  Earlier, the headphones were connected to the piano only in the evenings, so as not to wake up the neighbors, now it is constantly on the ears.  Surprisingly, there was a worthy replacement for the built-in 200-watt stereo with four speakers. <br><br><h2>  Back to reality </h2><br>  Let's talk about compatibility, information about which may be useful to most.  Do not be deceived by the cable with a headset - you can use headphones with tablets and smartphones, of course, but there are other more interesting cases.  Although at first we complained about the lack of an adapter of 6.3 mm, modern players without problems work with a 3.5 mm jack, and this model is worthy not just of a player, but of a top-end device (well, not the budget DAC itself).  Headphones are very sensitive to the quality of the tracks, you can not be lazy, download a couple of lossless and see for yourself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/992/5a7/b8e/9925a7b8ebd53bc40929af49c7965877.jpg"><br><br>  As for the styles of music, everything is suitable here - hip-hop, jazz and live music. <br><br><h2>  Verdict and price </h2><br>  The model is very interesting, though not universal, with its advantages in the form of excellent resolution and a reasonable price of 18,590 rubles, as well as disadvantages in the form of a not very steep noise reduction system, which nevertheless will ensure listening to music without unnecessary words of others.  Audio-Technica was pleased with the headphones from the middle price segment and the closed acoustic design that fans of monitor headphones would definitely appreciate. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/401673/">https://habr.com/ru/post/401673/</a></p>
