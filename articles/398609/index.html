      Years passed, the Internet appeared with the ability to quickly search for necessary materials and a selection, as unnecessary - smoothly migrated to the attic of the country house, where it is to this day.  The magazine slowly began to be forgotten. <br><br>  Under the tutorial on the example of the publication of one of my articles in the magazine "Radio". <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The following after thinking about the eternal morning - I went to the bookstore, where I bought a copy of magazine No. 11 for 2015. <br>  I looked through the copy I got from cover to cover in about 10‚Äì15 minutes right on the way home and thought: ‚ÄúHmm, why didn‚Äôt I ever publish anything in this magazine?  It is necessary to somehow correct this omission, while the magazine has not yet completely emaciated and has not closed. ‚Äù <br>  Why did I need it?  Firstly - the dream of childhood.  Secondly, to amuse one‚Äôs self-esteem, well, it would be very nice for father to get a magazine that he read all his life - with a published article by his son. <br><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãan article in a magazine has matured and gained strength, but an understanding of where to begin and in what direction to look for the preparation of the material has not appeared.  He began to look for reviews of the authors or todo sheet for the preparation of material for publication, but did not find anything sensible. <br>  I decided to take the bull by the horns and go through all the stages by experience. <br><br>  <b>Step 1. Letter to the editor.</b> <br>  On the same evening, I wrote to the editors by e-mail mail@radio.ru a letter of the following content: <br><br><blockquote>  Hello dear editors, <br>  I read your magazine since 8 years old.  At first, I simply diligently repeated the constructions described in the journal, then I began to design my own devices. <br>  Now, looking through the articles - I realized that I would like to share some things with other readers. <br>  Found the rules on your site before you prepare an article - it is desirable to coordinate the topic with the editors. <br>  I have several own developments, one of them: <br>  ... <br>  (here was a brief description of the design, a link to YouTube with a video demonstration of work, a link to photos of the device on my blog and a brief outline of the article) <br>  ... <br>  The planned volume of the article is 2-3 pages of printed text + a page with a diagram and photographs. <br>  There are also other developments that you can read about in my blog ... (link to blog) <br>  I hope that you will be interested in something from my work. <br>  Sincerely, The reader is so. </blockquote><br>  After 3 days I received an answer: <br><br><blockquote>  Hello, Reader. <br>  Your topic ... will be interesting to our readers.  But it should be noted that the editors do not print already published materials, including materials posted on the Internet. <br>  Therefore, the article should be significantly different from the already laid out.  For example, to be more complete, detailed and with high-quality illustrations. <br>  etc.  Hope this can be done.  Therefore, we will wait for materials. <br>  If you have other designs that are not posted on the Internet, please send, we will consider them. <br>  Respectfully, <br>  deputy  Ch.  Editor Igor Nechaev </blockquote><br>  How well things are going, I thought, you need to write an article as quickly as possible ... <br>  Since this was my first publication in a journal, I decided to make an article about a fairly simple device, because firstly I hadn‚Äôt laid out a scheme with firmware anywhere (just a photo of the appearance in my blog), and secondly, a very radio amateur device and should have interested the average reader of the magazine. <br><br>  The next day the article was written and sent to the editorial office. <br>  It is worth noting here that it is better to send photos and pictures immediately in good quality, they will be published in the magazine! <br><br>  Schemes should be drawn immediately in accordance with GOST standards, otherwise they will be redrawn and may add errors (although it seemed to me that they redraw 80% of the original schemes to fit them into free space on the journal page). <br><br>  <b>Step 2. Application for publication and author's card.</b> <br>  After 1 day, the answer came: <br><br><blockquote>  Good afternoon Reader <br>  Your article is received, thank you.  You need to send to the editors <br>  application for its publication and the "author card".  Forms in the application. <br><br>  <a href="https://yadi.sk/d/L2o2f0A7xhshk">application</a> </blockquote><br>  At this step there is a very important point.  Both documents in the completed form are sent by e-mail, and the original application for publication of the article is sent by regular paper mail to the editorial office. <br>  When publishing new articles - sending the original application by regular mail - is repeated.  At the same time, the author's card remains old.  This is such a system, a bit strange for the 21st century, isn't it? <br><br>  <b>Step 3. We are waiting for clarifications on the article or the refusal to publish.</b> <br>  Over the next month, I received clarifying letters to eliminate minor flaws in the scheme.  Somewhere there were no details of the values, where it was necessary to clarify the pin numbers of the chip.  In general, if you are asked clarifying questions - this is good.  If, however, in the past month they didn‚Äôt answer anything, then it‚Äôs better to turn first and clarify if your article hasn‚Äôt been rejected. <br><br>  I was lucky and everything went smoothly with my articles.  The only thing that did not immediately like it was that the editorial board would not achieve sounding of at least approximate publication dates.  As I was told later, for the authors, this is secret information that they will not recognize until the issue with the article is published. <br><br>  So we are still waiting for a couple of three months, until in the next issue of the magazine we accidentally find our last name in the table of contents opposite the article with a completely different name (you can monitor the table of contents on the journal‚Äôs website).  I had it 3 months after sending the article to the editor. <br>  Yes, according to the rules of the magazine - all this time it is impossible to shine with an article and a device map on the Internet, otherwise there is a chance that you will be removed from the publication. <br><br>  As a result, in the March issue of 2016 a familiar last name appeared in the table of contents and I immediately went to the bookstore for a hard copy of the magazine. <br>  Along the way, a topic appeared on the forum of the magazine with a discussion of the device, where I was immediately showered with questions about replacing parts with others with a corresponding modification of the firmware. <br><br>  By that time, I had already studied the discussion thread of magazines on a radiokot, read the authors' reviews and expected that the article could make minor changes so that it would more closely match the linguistic style of the magazine.  But what I saw was only 30% of my source code.  The rest was completely rephrased and rewritten by caring editors, naturally without my knowledge and approvals. <br><br>  There were also significant changes in the scheme, mostly - the elements were redrawn in order for the scheme to fit into the selected part of the journal page.  But under the pictures of the topology of printed circuit boards I was given a whole turn! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e6a/ca4/b9f/e6aca4b9fdd649dc8d1da6e41deccffd.JPG"><br><br>  <b>Step 4. The most pleasant</b> <br>  It turns out that the authors of articles in the journal are entitled to royalties.  The amount is over is not large, about 600-800 rubles.  for the magazine page, but the very fact of its presence undoubtedly warms the soul. <br>  The downside is that the fee is paid at least one month after the last part of the article.  In my case, the transfer occurred in June (half a year after sending the article!) The money was credited to a bank card, the details of which were indicated in the author's card.  The truth had to remind myself of a letter, otherwise - maybe they would have forgotten. <br>  Two of my published articles, totaling about 6 pages in two journals, were edited at about 4,300 rubles.  clean (after taxes). <br><br>  <b>Findings:</b> <br>  A childhood dream realized, pride amused, Daddy for my son was glad and got two original issues with my articles, everything seemed to end well. <br><br>  But!  After the publication, I didn‚Äôt have a desire to write another article to this journal.  Why?  Probably because of too long, bureaucratized and not transparent publishing process. <br><br>  In the 21st century, I would like at least to be able to track the status of publications in my account on the site, in the form of a list of my articles with the corresponding status: waiting for moderation, accepted for publication, scheduled for publication in number XX of the journal, signed in print, published in issue XX magazine. <br><br>  Again, it is not clear why to keep secret the planned issue of the journal with the publication. <br>  Correct the editors for all these shortcomings - and it would be possible to make plans for the following articles in order to be published at least once every two months.  Interesting and relevant material about which you can write - is complete.  But instead, the author gets 3-4 months of ignorance, after which any desire to write new articles disappears. <br>  Maybe that's why the magazine has become not as popular as before? <br>  Other technical journals live on paper: ‚ÄúTechnique of the youth‚Äù, ‚ÄúAt the wheel‚Äù, etc. <br><br>  I hope my post here will help new authors to gain courage and publish their developments in one of the most popular amateur radio magazines earlier. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/398609/">https://habr.com/ru/post/398609/</a></p>
