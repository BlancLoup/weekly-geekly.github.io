  <section class="page js-page"><h1>21 blogging facts from Copernicus</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <strong>For the year of blogging, I still understood something in this difficult matter :) Did you believe that it was not easy?</strong>  <strong>Right.</strong>  <strong>There are countless lists of how to blog correctly or incorrectly.</strong>  <strong>You will be sick, but you still read the next one:</strong> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>1. The</strong> number of backlinks does not depend on the usefulness, correctness, seriousness of the post.  Not at all.  I was often referred to because I published an absurdity, a semolina for mind, senseless research, nonsense, nonsense :) However, do not think that the number of backlinks is directly proportional to the stupidity of the message;) <br><br>  <strong>2. The</strong> number of comments does not depend on the length of the post.  I observed a lot of comments on heavyweight recordings and their absence in small records.  The number of words is influenced by the meaning, time of publication, presentation of the material, emotional charge. <br><br>  <strong>3.</strong> Mistakes are noticed only by the most meticulous readers.  Units react to them. 
      <br>

      <br>
      <strong>4.</strong> Commentators with a key in the head (ie, with a keyword instead of a name) usually appear from the darkness, something gurgles and disappears into the night darkness forever ... <br><br>  <strong>5. The</strong> percentage of loyal and active audience of the total number of readers is quite small (5-15%).  Under the loyal, I understand the audience that empathizes and is interested in your personal life.  The rest is enough on the drum on your life's hardships.  So it should be.  By an active audience, I mean the one that responds to posts - comments, puts links on their resources. <br><br>  <strong>6.</strong> Interview - a great opportunity to fuck interesting content for someone else's account :) Is that so?  Not.  To come up with questions without first studying the interlocutor, and even finding one is work.  Another thing is that I have a certain skill, and I do it easily and naturally :) <br><br>  <strong>7.</strong> If you interview in real time (ICQ, Skype, personal meeting), it will turn out to be much more dynamic and lively than if the questions are prepared in advance. <br><br>  <strong>8.</strong> Interesting interviews almost does not depend on questions.  The main thing - the answers.  I know for sure. <br><br>  <strong>9.</strong> To read the text easily, regardless of its semantic load, it is worth rereading it 2-3 times before publication.  As a rule, after that, you still have to climb inside and ‚Äúblow away dust particles‚Äù from an already published post. <br><br>  <strong>10.</strong> Preparing posts in advance is uninteresting and unproductive.  Although HZ.  I used to write everything from the heat of the heat. <br><br>  <strong>11.</strong> Show a blog to your girlfriend - a bad omen :) Just kidding.  I do not believe in omens.  I believe that any person can meet an almost ideal person and live with him happily.  I believe that love is only mutual.  If love is not mutual - to hell with it :) Why?  Yes, because it is easier and, under successful circumstances, to live longer.  By the way, Lena, I love you! <br><br>  <strong>12.</strong> If there is a real trouble, even inactive readers will respond.  Good people more.  I understood this when last year there was one tragedy (they killed a friend in Angarsk), and I asked for help.  Complete strangers knocked at me from all over the country.  If you don‚Äôt have enough of the thing that our ancestors could easily manage before the invention of electricity, then you shouldn‚Äôt ask about it ... It doesn't matter. <br><br>  <strong>13.</strong> Positive attitude attracts a positive reaction from the audience.  Politeness attracts politeness.  Is it necessary to explain?  :) <br><br>  <strong>14.</strong> Posts with bright emotional coloring mostly people like.  People read and thank, or they scold, or they rejoice, or they are sad ... People react. <br><br>  <strong>15.</strong> Readers feel very false.  They will believe in fiction only if the author himself convinces himself that this is how it was. <br><br>  <strong>16.</strong> The complexity is scary and significantly reduces the number of read post.  Simplicity, accessibility, ease - significantly increase readability. <br><br>  <strong>17.</strong> Paragraphs, lists, illustrations - good!  Monolithic pieces of text - bad. <br><br>  <strong>18.</strong> Lists significantly increase returns (the number of backlinks).  This has already buzzed all your ears, but that's exactly it!  I am sure that I will get a certain amount of "rounds" for this post :) <br><br>  <strong>19.</strong> In the narrative from the first person it is almost always possible to do without the letter ‚ÄúI‚Äù.  The text will look more harmonious, and readers will understand that you are you. <br><br>  <strong>20.</strong> Bloggers with experience hate lists a la "how to blog" or "how to promote a blog" :) But newcomers are trudging from them :) <br><br>  <strong>21.</strong> To hell with the rules!  And lists ... <br><br>  But I don‚Äôt know yet whether to end the post with a question to increase the number of comments? <br><br>  <a href="http://www.kopernik.name/">The source is ‚ÄúAt the edge of the Earth.</a>  <a href="http://www.kopernik.name/">Copywriter Blog ¬ª</a> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/287508/">https://habr.com/ru/post/287508/</a></p>
