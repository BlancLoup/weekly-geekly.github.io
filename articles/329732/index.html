  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Innopolis and the slow pursuit of the silicon valleys</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It all began, apparently, as usual - with the Big Bang, maybe a little later.  When the electrons around the nucleus were 14. Or on the first day of the creation of the world, namely, the creation of heaven and earth (but at the moment when the electrons became 14).  Or on the second day of the flight around the world of the pasta monster (well, you understood about 14 electrons).  Or maybe when that very single electron appeared, which is everywhere and nowhere at once (but at least fourteen times around one nucleus).  At that moment, silicon appeared in the world.  First, in the XIX century, it was called silicon, then in Russia it gained a strong ancient Greek nickname (translated into Russian ‚Äúsilicon‚Äù - a cliff, a mountain).  A century later became the basis for semiconductor chips and silicone and gave birth to two valleys in California.  One is pure silicon (silicon), in Russia called Silicon for differentiation.  The other is porn-silicone (silicone), and enough from it, and so much honor to be mentioned again next. <br><br>  In the middle of the XX century due to scientific and technological progress, the foresight of the leadership of Stanford University, the availability of their own land and the testament of Lelan Stanford, as well as some other factors, Silicon Valley near the city of San Francisco (Palo Alto) became the flagship of technical development in the world.  Now in every state, if they create some technopark, they immediately proudly name it a second silicon valley.  Therefore, by the XXI century of the second Silicon Valley, there are already about a hundred.  The last of them, at the suggestion of Dmitry Anatolyevich Medvedev, was also Silicon, was born in 2015 near Kazan. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/997/a07/bec/997a07bec13a43c897a8fe3fa7544cc2.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Source: centralandwolfe.com.</i>  <i>Silicon Valley - the original</i>

      The main, but not the main part of the article is devoted just to Innopolis, but first we will go through each more or less significant second Silicon Valley, so that we can compare with what. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Silicon Islands.  Japan </h3><br>  In the 1970s, on the Japanese island of Kyushu, many companies began to open enterprises for the production of silicon semiconductor devices.  Since then, on the island electronics is considered the main industry, since then the island is called silicon.  The economic basis of Fukuoka, Nagasaki and Kumamoto prefectures.  Among the well-known companies of the island are Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Toshiba, Sony, Kuyshu Electric, and one way or another all known Japanese brands.  However, Kyushu cannot be fully considered an analogue of the Silicon Valley.  In industrial terms, all this is true.  But Japan‚Äôs business center is Tokyo, and unlike Google‚Äôs, the majority of Kyushu‚Äôs technology companies ‚Äôthink tanks are located outside the island, so Kyushu‚Äôs independence, ideology and identity are not there. <br><br><h3>  Taiwan </h3><br>  At about the same time as Kyushu, Taiwan lies next to it.  Despite the martial law, which lasted half a century, the conflict with mainland China, the island during this time could become one of the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A7%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%258B%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D1%2585_%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0">‚ÄúFour Asian Tigers‚Äù</a> , which also includes South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore.  Taiwan's progress is impressive.  Until the 1970s, only agriculture, textiles and other cheap industries developed on the island.  By the 70th, piracy activity was booming, wherever possible, for example, in the production of expensive textbooks in various disciplines.  By the 80th, textbooks and the rest became licensed.  By the 1990s, Taiwan was already producing computer equipment.  Japanese culture had a very serious impact on the island, because before World War II, Taiwan was Japanese for a long time. <br><br><h3>  Singapore </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/762/9bf/0ca/7629bf0caa1f42deb34d8c1d501a1a8e.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Source: koreaittimes.com</i> <i><br></i> <br>  Without the participation of Japan in Singapore, too, not done.  True, it was very short, but how spectacular!  During the Second World War, the British lost the battle for Singapore, as they were expecting Japanese attacks from the sea, and those, being a maritime power, marched to the island by land.  Apparently, the leadership of Singapore, first of all, the legendary Lee Kuan Yew, was very surprised and inspired, and the economic breakthrough in the post-war decades was also unexpected for everyone.  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259B%25D0%25B8_%25D0%259A%25D1%2583%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD_%25D0%25AE">Lee Kuan Yew</a> managed to give the island an investment appeal by reducing corruption to zero and almost personally helping to organize the production of each transnational corporation (TNC) in the territory.  As a result, Singapore is a high-tech city, a leader in the production of everything in everything.  Large investment center.  The economic miracle of the XX century.  Another flint island. <br><br><h3>  Ireland </h3><br>  If the giants of a real silicon valley choose the territory of your one-room apartment for the organization of production, you become a silicon branch.  From the side of you, of course, they will call the next second valley, you will receive a powerful charge from investment rivers, but there is nothing independent in this feat, except that you managed to draw attention to your odnushka.  But it only happened because you were chosen.  You are elected, Neo, elected TNK to become the next branch in the matrix.  With Ireland passed the same trick, but not quite.  The government (still under Margaret Thatcher) consistently reduced the corporate income tax, eventually bringing it to the lowest in Europe (12.5%), gaining interest from US corporations.  It is strange, of course, that the same French, for example, with a rate of 30%, do not see economic expediency in reducing the tax (in the Irish treasury, the share of income from such taxes is 15%, in France - only 5%).  But not only did the ‚ÄúCeltic tiger‚Äù manage to become a ‚Äúsilicon island‚Äù, he also used these investments extremely profitably, directing revenues to the full support of local IT developers.  Therefore, Ireland is now ranked first in Europe for software development.  There are two secrets of success for toffee companies: <br><br><ol><li>  They finish for the big players those decisions that they don‚Äôt get their hands on.  It turns out an interesting symbiosis.  And the giants are not against such an improvement in their product, and Irish start-ups receive a guaranteed influx of customers. </li><li>  Irish do not want much success.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs convenient for us to be small - it‚Äôs easier to be flexible, open to customers, easier to understand and offer what they really need,‚Äù they say.  At the same time, there is no competition, everyone is busy with his own niche, to add good benefits for small and medium-sized businesses - Irish developers live wonderfully. </li></ol><br><h3>  Denmark-Sweden <br></h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/d20/610/c99/d20610c99fa944d8896261864a0b08d6.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Source: mediconvalley.com</i> <br><br>  Geographically, the Medicon Valley is not a valley at all, but the Danish island of Zealand and a suburb of Swedish Malmo in the Scandinavian Peninsula, separated by the Sund Strait.  In 1983, the IDEON science park was formed, to which six more were added later.  Parks specializes in biomedical technology.  In total, there are about 300 companies in the valley, among them the Danish medical giant Novo Nordisk is the kingdom‚Äôs main tax-payer, Genmab, a public pharmaceutical company, LEO Pharma, better known in Russia, and something else Swedish (less well known at the end you will understand why).  Companies have a maximum of 50 people, so they are easily manageable.  In total, more than 3 million people live in the valley, of which 40 thousand are research workers, 150 thousand students (enrolled in 14 medical universities).  Valley is a regular supplier of Nobel laureates.  But the main feature, for which the valley is called the unofficial state, is the ideology of personal medicine.  Since 1998, each employee of the valley strives to find an individual approach to any patient, because according to studies, in 30% of cases, universal prescriptions against diseases such as cancer and diabetes do not work. <br><br>  Funny fact.  Denmark, with its more loyal labor and tax legislation, pulls the blanket over itself.  It turns out that the Swedish part of the valley population goes to work in Denmark in the morning, and returns to her home in the evening.  This is the Swedish suburbs.  And most likely, this is the reason for the prevalence of Danish brands in the valley - it is convenient to live in Sweden and not work <br><br><h3>  India </h3><br>  One day in the XII century, another Indian ruler got lost in the forest, came across a village and spent the night there.  The woman with whom he stopped, out of respect, fed him the most expensive thing she had - boiled beans.  Out of respect, the ruler called this place ‚Äúthe village of boiled beans‚Äù - Bengaluru (but it is quite possible that everything was not so before). <br><br>  One day in 1985, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments">Texas Instruments</a> became the first TNCs based in Bangalore.  But nothing followed, and to Silicon Bangalore, Texas was involved except in its pioneering, perhaps to the same extent as boiled beans are associated with the name of the city. <br>  IT companies came here just at the height of <a href="https://pokupo.ru/blog/post/epokha-myl-nykh-puzyrei-v-e-commerce-rossii">the</a> 2001 <a href="https://pokupo.ru/blog/post/epokha-myl-nykh-puzyrei-v-e-commerce-rossii">dotcom crisis</a> .  Apparently, this contributed to cheap labor and some of the English-speaking population, well, the same Texas (by the way, the rival Palo Alto with its silicon hills in Austin).  Over the year, their number increased from almost zero to three hundred, including Sun Microsystems, Intel, Cisco research centers, Google research centers, Microsoft, and many others.  And this is despite the lack of stable electricity, roads and the airport in the city.  Now Bangalore is a full-fledged silicon branch.  In IT areas, life is quite decent and European, beyond their borders immediately begin slums, garbage and hunger.  A typical city of contrasts, unlike Dublin or Singapore. <br><br><h3>  China </h3><br>  The silicon scientific campus Zhongguancun is located in one of the most densely populated areas of Beijing - Haidian (3,200,000 people for 2010).  In 1980, out of more than a billion Chinese, one was found - Chen Chunxian - who went against and ahead of the system.  He then opened on Zhongguancun street (well, as ‚Äúa street‚Äù - to Siberia such a ‚Äústreet‚Äù), the first (!) Private innovative enterprise ‚ÄúSupport service of advanced technologies‚Äù.  Despite the fact that the vector of China‚Äôs policy has just changed from a totalitarian ‚Äúspecial path‚Äù to a socialist market economy, Chunxiang was mercilessly criticized (the old evil thing ‚Äúwherever you go, what do you have - most need - sit down and do not hang out‚Äù ‚Äùis not only common Russia).  However, the Central Committee of the Communist Party, which took the new course, supported the initiative.  Immediately a whole squall of applications began, and by 1986 there were 100 private innovative enterprises in Zhongguanzun alone. <br><br>  Then a technopark was built, which received the same name as the street.  In 2007, there were more than 22 thousand high-tech enterprises, which employed about a million people, bringing more than $ 200 billion of total income.  Currently in Zhongguanzun have branches: <br><br>  - 43 of the 500 largest companies in the world; <br>  - 4 out of 10 software companies; <br>  - 23 transnational corporations; <br>  - 20 Chinese companies participating in the NASDAQ list (Baidu, Sohu, Sina, and others). <br><br>  Moreover, the total share of local firms is more than 59% (113 firms).  And their contribution to the high-tech development is commensurate with the world (first of all, the companies ‚ÄúFonder‚Äù and ‚ÄúLegends‚Äù). <br><br>  The Zhongguancun Technopark has sectors with all sectors: energy and environment, innovative materials, digital technologies, the aerospace industry, biomedicine.  There is also the so-called startup village Innoway, consisting of a number of (some reasonably believe - bubble) incubators promoting startups. <br><br><h3>  Big (small) five <br></h3><br>  European scientific and technical centers of the big five behave modestly in comparison with the above, on the one hand, on the other - each claims to be the European silicon valley (they are politely silent about Sweden and Denmark).  Let's go briefly and on them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/adf/14e/c28/adf14ec28f03438a815b8d934d1bbd36.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Source: twizz.ru.</i>  <i>European top - British left, Spain-Italy on the backs</i> <br><br>  <b>Cambridge Science Park (UK)</b> - created in 1973.  The owner of the territory is the company Trinity College, many companies come from the University of Cambridge and to some extent controlled by it or actively cooperate.  Small and medium high-tech firms provide 20% of employment in the city.  In the park, as well as throughout Cambridge, it is forbidden to play tennis, they are also proud of (who, of course) their first transsexual mayor. <br><br>  <b>Sophia-Antipolis (Antibes-Valbonne, France)</b> - a technopark was established in 1970-1984.  Sofia - the spouse of the founder of the park Senator Laffitte.  There are a number of universities, the headquarters of the W3C World Wide Web Consortium, and more than 40 companies. <br><br>  <b>Saxon Silicon Valley (Dresden, Germany)</b> - all the same, only the discipline and the Germans. <br><br>  <b>Technoparks of the Costa del Sol (Malaga, Spain) and Catania (Italy)</b> are the same as in Germany, only heat and tourism in the form of a competing (and as a result, relaxing even scientific staff) field of activity. <br><br>  Actually, these technology parks have not achieved any outstanding results, so the big five, if viewed only from the ‚Äúsilicon‚Äù side, do not look so big. <br><br><h3>  And what about Innopolis?  View from the outside </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/ad8/aad/7f3/ad8aad7f36814755adea63e8e6d61726.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Source: izent.ru</i> <br><br>  On the level of interest of the state, which became the initiator of Innopolis, the following fact can serve.  26 billion rubles were spent on the construction of the whole city.  The ill-fated and bottomless football Zenit-arena.to this day has already accumulated 50 billion rubles of expenses.  Spending on science in Russia is at least 3 times less than on defense (1 against 3 trillion rubles, respectively).  It is a shame to compare with the United States and China (there both categories amount to hundreds of billions of dollars).  Nevertheless, Innopolis is alive and seems to be living.  Yes, and the state of Innopolis created for it-business, in the first place, - they say, ‚Äúthe conditions have been created, and then you yourself‚Äù. <br><br>  Are they made?  Here are a few facts. <br><br><ol><li>  Specialists, read, residents in the city frankly not enough.  For them, the city <a href="https://roem.ru/27-09-2016/233646/innopolis-stavki-students/">launched a</a> free program of specialized training with further employment in the resident company.  But the trouble is - there are practically no such companies in the city either.  Unless Sbertech - the main partner of the IT-city project.  Sbertech Innopolis currently has just over 180 employees.  Plans to bring them up to 500. About plans separately.  Here it comes out: of the declared 150 thousand inhabitants for 2 years, barely 2,000 were recruited (officially registered - just over 100 plus 700 existing and already occupied apartments plus students and visiting staff from neighboring places - mainly Kazan).  By the way, here are the semi-annual results of the <a href="https://apply.innopolis.ru/stc/">program</a> - 9,000 applications have been submitted, 140 candidates have been selected, 85% of them got the job.  Not much.  And all because of the lack of demand in the city. <br><br></li><li>  IT companies in the city do not stretch - it can be seen.  It seems as if they are eyeing a new phenomenon.  Of the residents currently listed as 40 companies.  But this is in words, the actual number can be reported only by the inhabitants of Habr and Innopolis at the same time.  Among the forty listed and the main Internet giant of Russia - Yandex.  On the opening of the office Yandex <a href="https://yandex.ru/company/services_news/2016/0608">reported</a> back in June 2016. <br><br>  However, after two months the office was not opened.  Yandex did not receive the tax benefits promised to all IT companies, but out of respect he said that he was satisfied with even a discount on the rental of premises.  There is still nothing officially known about the office.  It is not on the map, it is not in the list of offices on the corresponding page.  Who saw the Yandex office in Innopolis, please inform.  But its absence is logical, rather, because: there are no tax privileges, the office in Kazan is nearby and everything is still damp there.  Why go to Yandex Innopolis?  No need yet. <br><br></li><li>  The first mayor of Innopolis, Yegor Ivanov, resigned two years later.  Not from a good life for sure.  He motivated his decision simply - he returns home to Moscow.  No reasons or hints. <br><br></li><li>  Over the past few months, Innopolis has been indulging in news only from local Tatarstan publications.  However, major events are among them: the acquisition by Qiwi of the resident Innopolis, and the planned investments of Tinkoff Bank, and the investment of the Chinese investor in the Russian competitor Android.  Anyway, all the news is assurances for a happy future.  In Russia, they are able to certify, as well as to stamp out numerous reports on a successful and bright past.  By the way, about the bright past - the company Innopolis and University Innopolis recently stopped blogging on Habr√©.  Apparently, confusing prices (and again, by the way, prices are really wild, available only to selected companies).  The only resources where Innopolis is stably active are social networks (but this is mainly entertainment). <br><br></li><li>  Of the accomplished achievements of Innopolis, these are buses on electric motors, drones in the registry office, bringing up rings for marriages, numerous robots playing football, and the pride most often mentioned in the network are telegram bots and concierge service.  Most are about infrastructure or education, but again not business. <br><br></li><li>  For education, perhaps, you can put a solid plus.  <a href="http://pikabu.ru/story/zhizn_v_innopolise_4322201">Judging</a> by the <a href="https://vc.ru/p/msk-to-innopolis">reviews of</a> students and teachers, this area is really developing now.  Students enthusiastically respond to all resources and are immersed in the learning process 16 hours a day.  And it is the students and teachers who instill hope that everything will be really good. </li></ol><br>  As one of the IT specialists put it, ‚ÄúInnopolis is the best thing that has happened to education and science in Russia over the past 25 years.‚Äù  Two years for IT-hail is really a short time.  There was not even the first university graduation.  Who knows, maybe a few of these students with burning eyes are jerking so that no staleness and corruption will not keep up behind them?  And Innopolis will extend into the silicon future, as the Irish, Singaporeans and Taiwanese did in their time.  Despite any facts, benefits and cuts. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> after writing the article, we managed to talk to the author of the words ‚ÄúInnopolis is the best event in 25 years‚Äù.  This is a university researcher who became one of the first residents of the city.  Three questions were asked: <br><br><ol><li>  <b>Has his opinion changed on the status of the event?</b>  No, it has not changed, an even greater global confidence was added to it, since several encouraging events followed: for example, compatriot Alexander Kuleshov was appointed instead of the unbroken British professor Edward Crowley in the scientific and technical environment of the city, so to speak. . <br><br></li><li>  <b>Will Innopolis be able to catch up to at least some second-rate silicon valley and when?</b>  The resident is confident that for 5 years Innopolis will be among the leaders among projects created from scratch - like Sophia-Antipolis.  If we take into account all the indicators, such as: university, infrastructure and investment, then it will take longer to wait, but it will have to.  Well, Silicon Valley has been and will be unique in its own way. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Is there Yandex in Innopolis and which IT companies are really active in the city?</b>  Yandex is (and it is still surprising - author's note).  Of the large and active ones, the aforementioned Sbertech, Acronis (data protection), ICL (computer equipment manufacturer), Cognitive Technologies (software developer). </li></ol><br>  Honestly - I can not believe in the optimism of the resident Innopolis.  Do we live in Russia?  And not such projects died.  I can not believe it - but let him and those students be right.  They urgently need to be right. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/329732/">https://habr.com/ru/post/329732/</a></p>
