    <h3>  Programmer's story about yourself. </h3><br>  First of all, I ask the person to tell you how he came to web programming.  When I started, when I got hooked on programming :) <br>  I ask very much about the last place or two jobs, what the person did, what he was responsible for, what he did there technically and organizationally. <br><br>  It is necessary that the person relaxed. <br>  Once at this stage I asked about five options, why round hatches and other questions, but it died out a long time ago, because it gives nothing :) <br><br>  As soon as it becomes clear what drives a person and what experience he has, go to the technical part. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Short questions on the horizon. </h3><br>  Web programming is a technology zoo, I recall a joke about driver requirements, if they were as powerful as programmers :) <br><br>  For 10-15 minutes, you need to understand, and how deeply a person owns a technology, to understand the level of his understanding. <br>  I survey in the following areas: DBMS, SQL, algorithms, data structures, languages, command line, OOP, * nix. <br><br>  Experience and understanding divide into three levels - elementary, OK, advanced :) <br><br>  First of all, the database.  There are among the questions of the first type there is ‚Äúhow does a right join differ from a JOIN?‚Äù, And the third one is ‚Äúwhat is a B + -tree and why are they used so often in the implementation of indices?‚Äù. <br><br>  Very interesting about OOP.  If the question ‚Äúwhat is encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance‚Äù is the second level, then one can explain what architecture is, why need it, which architecture metrics worsen / improve refactoring with emphasis on SOLID + DRY + IoC with performance optimization). <br><br>  As a rule, the answer to the question is one or two sentences.  Sometimes we can talk in the abstract if a knowledgeable candidate remembers, for example, self-balancing red-black trees.  Well, if he notes that he regularly reads Habr and saw an article about it there. <br><br>  Of course, I‚Äôll ask about Linux and I‚Äôll be glad if a person is sitting at least under Ubuntu.  I'll actually ask how to list the files with ‚Äútest‚Äù in the name with grep (ls | grep ‚Äútest‚Äù), or what is ls |  xargs svn up. <br><br>  ‚ÄúBut this is not all yet‚Äù (C) TV-SHOP 90x <br><br><h3>  Problem solving </h3><br>  But no matter how beautiful the theory was, it was all just warming up before the main part. <br>  I try for half an hour to talk with the candidate so that he understands that he is not in front of a HR girl, understand his motivation, speak over the points on the schedule and his wishes on the RFP. <br><br>  And I give tasks.  I agree with the article that was translated here somehow that a real programmer is determined by the ability to apply recursion and pointers. <br><br>  In many ways, this is akin to human evolution.  They say that the ability to operate in the mind immediately with 7 + -2 elements differs from monkeys, and the understanding of recursion (the need for sharpening chisels, the pattern, recursively decreasing, makes the blade very sharp and well cutting). <br><br>  Similarly, the ability to mentally represent what pointer arithmetic is and to understand the work of recursion makes programmers stand out among ordinary people. <br><br>  As a rule, I give a simple task and ask to write the code directly online, without any checks.  Recently, I give 10-15 minutes without me, if a person is worried. <br><br>  And for one or two tasks, it becomes clear what the outcome of the interview. <br><br>  Questions about the hatches - nafig.  Long live recursion! <br><br>  <b>upd.</b>  task with oral interview and additional task at home. <br>  <b>Task 1</b> <br>  Given an array of unlimited nesting, you need to write a function that displays it as a nested list with indents proportional to the depth, and the current path to the element. <br><br>  Call showMenu (menu); <br>  must produce html code as per address <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6a4/af0/a82/6a4af0a820ab59f97572d86ca847d100.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Array: <br><pre> menu = [
