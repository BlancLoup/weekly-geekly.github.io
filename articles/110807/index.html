This conclusion can be absolutely logical for AI.  Moreover, the creation of an AI similar to man is impossible, or rather stupid to say, because it will be like creating a bicycle on square wheels instead of the well-known classic.  How exactly and why this is possible, and I want to tell you.  And also you will learn why humanity is what it is. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/44/39/44390b4d7bb692d4df17be25f8822649.jpg" align="right">  All the ‚Äútechies‚Äù and not only know the classic scenario of entering a new functionality into any project when testing time is minimal.  There is an expansion of opportunities and the opening of new areas of further development, however, it can often cause uncontrolled failures, inadequate reactions, and in some cases even the collapse of the entire system, with the need to roll back to previous versions. <br>  This is exactly the way things are now with the human mind and subconscious, or rather the human mind ‚Äî this is exactly the new functionality that runs the risk of ‚Äúrolling back the entire system‚Äù if its main bug is not closed in time. <br>  But we will not go into the subtleties of the nervous regulation of a person, and in brief and clear examples we will explain the actual problem. <br><br>  For an example that will help visually demonstrate the mechanism of interaction between the subconscious and the conscious, consider phobias.  Their beauty is that you can clearly say when a person is under the influence of a phobia, what he can and can not do with it, and why.

      Phobia occurs as a result of short-term highly emotional experience, coupled with a threat to life.  As a result of a phobia, a person receives a psychological survival strategy, which is directly recorded in the subconscious.  Subsequently, if a similar situation arises (stimuli), a strategy will be reproduced that helped to avoid the threat in the case of a phobia.  For example: if a person nearly drowned, he can get aquaphobia, and as a result, he will be afraid of any approach to water, even when the consciousness can already understand that there is no real danger anymore.  Moreover, the person himself cannot do anything with this phobia (only after a special training session).  It is also known that a phobia occurs much faster than the stimulus has time to reach the consciousness, therefore the mechanism of consciousness lies higher along the chain than the subconsciousness itself, and the consciousness works much slower. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/be/d4/bed4025356aa888b046db06aa7918d3a.jpg" align="right"><br>  Thus, the subconscious is a super-fast memory with minimal rewriting capabilities (although it is possible).  Once worked - fell into the subconscious mind - use all life.  That is, we can unconsciously reproduce the whole life of a strategy that was adequate only for 5 seconds sometime 20 years ago, and we will consider this to be completely normal.  Phobias are a good example.  The subconscious, in a huge number of cases of social interaction produces solutions that are inadequate to the current reality.  In the case of wildlife and animal mode of existence, the subconscious is an ideal mechanism, but for man it is not enough. <br><br>  Consciousness, in turn, is a new functional, a kind of ‚Äúadequateizer‚Äù of behavioral strategies.  It collects as much as possible already accomplished strategies of behavior and tries them on to what the subconscious gives out.  Consciousness became necessary when behavioral strategies (social society) became much more complicated.  It is slow, many times slower than the subconscious, but it can create new strategies based on a synthesis of experience. <br><br>  However, there is one problem with the new functionality.  Consciousness is almost completely subordinate to the subconscious.  Simply put, we first make a decision on the basis of a possibly inadequate current situation of experience, and only then we try to match it with the help of consciousness.  But almost all decisions we make consciously, and in order to force the consciousness to do what the subconscious needs, we created emotions and feelings that have significant priority.  Most of the negative emotions of a person, and in fact the entire current ‚Äúfucking situation in the world‚Äù, are the result of a conflict of inadequate subconsciousness and adequate consciousness.  Pity, fear, heartache, laziness, greed, resentment, blind faith, hatred, self-flagellation, weakness, etc.  - this is all the result of inadequate strategies of the subconscious when perceived by the consciousness. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/6f/47/6f47d797d108667ff2f0f8d3d8b7f08c.jpg" align="right">  For example: with consciousness you know that you want a new, highly paid job, but laziness arises and you do nothing, so the subconscious mind stimulates the mind to do nothing on the basis of some past perceived strategies, like ‚Äúdo not send out a resume, you were told that you were nowhere‚Äù they won't take it, you can't. ‚Äù  Only laziness and negatives come to consciousness in order to create inaction, although the strategy itself, which is dictated by the subconscious, is already inadequate. <br><br>  Briefly: <br>  The subconscious mind is engaged in everything that is considered vital - quickly and without hesitation, the main thing is that at least once the strategy of behavior has worked. <br>  Consciousness tries to make a decision on the basis of past experience, due to which it consumes more resources and time, and sometimes it is ‚Äúprompted‚Äù by the subconscious mind to create emotions and feelings. <br><br>  Now back to AI.  Assume that a person was able to provide the AI ‚Äã‚Äãwith a sufficient amount of operating power, sensors and memory.  It is just a matter of time.  In comparison with computer technology, the process of ‚Äúadequate‚Äù, re-analysis taking into account existing strategies and new input data, is a fairly resource-intensive process (consciousness), but it is possible.  Hardly the creators of AI will go to the step of creating departments of memory with a single recordable information (strategy), which will be used in the future without any changes to any similar situation.  It would be a bicycle on square wheels.  So, the AI ‚Äã‚Äãwill not have subconsciousness, but only pure consciousness.  As a result, in further development, humanity, due to inadequate subconscious strategies (for example, some such chains of strategies lead a person to suicide), can be perceived by the AI ‚Äã‚Äãas a threat to the further existence of not only the environment, but also the person himself.  That is, the AI ‚Äã‚Äãcan realize that if a person is not taught to use the consciousness and to subconsciously adapt, then he may well self-destruct, and take with him everyone he has time.  However, to teach a person to use consciousness for AI is an impossible task, so the conclusion ‚Äúfrom two evils‚Äù will be logical, and more simply ‚Äúto destroy or take under direct control‚Äù.  By the way, with animals it is not required, they do not have such mechanisms and they are not able to bring significant damage. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/74/15/7415e2a556c5d36b7ed34bfcb1c053f0.jpg" align="right">  Almost perfectly close in behavior to AI with a pure consciousness can be called the role of Kean Reeves in the film ‚ÄúThe Day When the Earth Has Stopped‚Äù (there was no occasion to watch the first film and read the book). <br><br>  The strategies of all people, subconscious in the field of social interaction, are very often not adequate to reality, it is human nature.  Be aware that as soon as you experience a negative or strong positive emotion or feeling, you have inadequate subconsciousness, almost always.  All decisions that the mind makes are emotionally neutral, since they do not require subconscious stimulation. <br>  Virtually all of the current existing human civilization is a kind of test: whether the new functionality will take root, or start over again.  The problem lies not with the federal treasury, the greedy secret world government, the dollar rate or the growth of the GDP.  The problem lies inside each person, and more precisely in the system of the work of his brain, consciousness and subconsciousness, because without him, there would be no problems. <br><br>  This article was prepared in the framework of the future small simple project, which in simple words will help to understand how and why the mind and the subconscious work, and how to learn to make your subconscious mind adequate to reality.  The bonus of such work: the lack of laziness and maximum efficiency, complete confidence in their decisions in any field, a deep understanding of their own psyche, the removal of most negative emotions, a guarantee against midlife crises and much more.  Even briefly and ‚Äútechnically‚Äù you will learn what love is without any ‚Äúherbalife‚Äù and ‚Äúbelieve in the power of pink ponies‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/02/de/02de4403f1ba7971e3bd268980421238.gif" align="left">  So I would like to congratulate everyone in advance on the upcoming new year 2011, which, by the way, has less than 5 days left, and wish the fulfillment of the most cherished wishes.  Usually, for the new year, people promise themselves that in the new year everything will be new, they promise to keep changing and become even better, so go ahead, everything is in your power.  Good luck and success to you in the new year :) <br><br>  <b>UPD1</b> <br>  <s>In connection with a large number of questions that have arisen, for those who are really interested in the topic, you can unsubscribe at hs2adm@gmail.com - I will send a link to the raw version of the project.</s> <br>  The project is open and located at: <a href="http://hs2.me/hs2book">hs2.me/hs2book</a> <br><br>  <b>UPD2</b> Pro pruflinki. <br>  If a person tells you that he is well versed in your motorcycle, because he has the same one, and he touched it many times and also sorted it out to other people, then do not ask him "in what book did you read this" or do not ask to show a diploma repair engineer.  Sometimes it is enough that he has this bike. <br><br>  Most studies are made as a result of my <u>practical</u> work with people, as well as observations.  Unfortunately, a full-fledged literature, where you could find all the descriptions and immediately - no.  It just did not write (or I did not see it).  If you want to go the same way, then first read the following: <br>  NLP all Bendler and Grinder <br>  Works on Psycholinguistics N. Chomsky, F. Pucelika <br>  Do not growl at the dog - Pryor Karen <br>  Principles of the brain - Hermann Hacken <br>  Any literature on self-development, because there are indications of positive and negative strategies, and where they come from.  In particular: <br>  Steve Pavlin's ‚Äúfigurative‚Äù work - ‚ÄúSelf-development for smart people.‚Äù <br>  Life strategies: do what works, do what makes sense - Philip McGraw <br>  The magic of the brain and the labyrinths of life - NP Bekhtereva <br>  Systems Thinking - S. Senge <br>  Teach your brain to work - Matthew MacDonald <br>  Other chemistry - Denis Burkhaev (highly recommend!) <br>  It is also important to understand child psychology: <br>  How to talk, to have children listen, and how to listen, to children talk - Adel Faber, Elaine Mazlish <br>  After three it's too late - Masaru Ibuka (the work is old, but in many respects correct). <br><br>  If they want to read all this and comprehend, I will tell you where else you can search. <br><br>  <b>UPD3</b> <br>  I understand those who do not believe that there are still people who are able to independently search for, structure and analyze data, create systems and maybe write something that nobody else has written - but the work of the psyche is like IT, enough computer (brain) and desire .  This is not a copy-paste from books or other people's work.  This is the source. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/110807/">https://habr.com/ru/post/110807/</a></p>
