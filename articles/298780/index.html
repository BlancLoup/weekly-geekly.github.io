Currently, the company employs more than 13,000 people in 64 offices around the world, and the number of specialists hired only grows with time. <br><br>  During an <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/how-facebook-finds-exceptional-employees-2016-2">interview</a> for Business Insider, Facebook recruiting head Miranda Kalinowski spoke about the basic principles of recruiting new employees - a new team member must sincerely believe in the company's mission to enable people to make the world more open. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <blockquote>  ‚ÄúWe want to make sure that in this way we are getting closer in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãhiring employees to the basic principles that are inherent in our products,‚Äù shared Miranda Kalinowski. </blockquote><br><br>  The process of finding new employees on Facebook is different from that on Instagram and Oculus VR, but is generally broken down into several key principles. <br><br>  <b>Facebook is looking for someone who likes to do something new.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8fe/796/107/8fe79610765b4f259706b261dddfb1df.jpg"><br><br>  The company tries to hire professionals who love to create new things.  Even hiring an engineer or financial analyst, the company hopes that each of them will be able to bring something new to Facebook.  Employees hired by the company are never completely satisfied with the existing solutions and are constantly trying to bring something new. <br><br>  The company tries to find strengths in each employee and cultivate them, instead of focusing on weaknesses.  Anyone who has ever listened to Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs speech could hear about plans to ‚Äúconnect‚Äù to another five billion people who still do not use the most popular social network. <br><br>  <b>Facebook is looking for people with different views.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bac/9b9/9a7/bac9b99a72244c6a9b768851ffe64121.jpg"><br><br>  The diversity of attitudes, opinions, cultures within the company is what Facebook recruiters are looking for when looking for new employees.  Each of these professionals can bring something new to the company. <br><br>  Miranda Kalinowski notes that Facebook always hires the best of the best, but does not want to be limited to only the top 10 universities in the United States.  Instead, the company employs employees of different nationalities from different universities from around the world.  In addition, within the framework of Facebook University there is a three-year internship program, which is open to all second-year students. <br><br>  <b>Facebook is looking for talents and with some experience</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8fe/796/107/8fe79610765b4f259706b261dddfb1df.jpg"><br><br>  Each of the test tasks inside Facebook is conditionally divided into four or five interviews, allowing to evaluate the candidate‚Äôs abilities and his ability to solve various problems.  Among such interviews are present, both deleted using video instant messengers and personal ones. <br><br>  Managers can conduct a tour of the department by asking certain questions in order to understand the technical knowledge of the specialist in his field.  For example, a programmer may be asked to write code on the board to evaluate his solution to a particular problem ‚Äî a typical task for a programmer with regard to recruiting in other companies. <br><br>  Each candidate is asked hypothetical questions to understand the logic of thinking, which will determine whether he is suitable or not for a given place. <br><br>  It is noteworthy that other IT companies try to adhere to similar principles when hiring new employees, so it‚Äôs difficult to single out all these basics from the words of the head of Facebook recruiting as a unique solution. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298780/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298780/</a></p>
