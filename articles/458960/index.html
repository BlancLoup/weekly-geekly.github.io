      ‚ÄúBecause we will never find a new IT director for ourselves!‚Äù  - Tatiana, as usual, began to blush with indignation.  - You both went to the increase, and let down all the candidates on the brakes! <br><br>  - Why do you care? <br><br>  - I'm the director of personnel, that's why! <br><br>  - Wait ... I got it!  - Sergey smiled like a child.  ‚ÄúYour prize is on fire, right?‚Äù  Exactly, soon the end of the year, KPIs will be counted, and you have one of the key positions empty - the IT director. <br><br>  Tatiana, obviously experiencing a mixture of at least two feelings, performed some kind of soothing exercise ‚Äî took a deep breath, held the air in her lungs for a few seconds, but, feeling that she had begun to blush even more because of a lack of air, she exhaled loudly.  Sergey, as he could, drove a smile from his face, watching the breathing exercises. <br><br>  ‚ÄúSergey ...‚Äù began Tatiana. <br><br>  ‚ÄúOkay, there will be a CIO.‚Äù  - Seriously said Sergey.  - Is the candidate decent? <br><br>  - Yes.  - in the voice of Tatiana sounded notes of hope.  - Here, I brought a resume! <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Excitement from the upcoming discharge of a dangerous career situation made itself felt - Tatiana's hands trembled, and, according to the standard scenario, all their contents fell noisily to the floor.  Sergey rushed to help, almost colliding with his head with Tatyana‚Äôs head, and also flushed a little. <br><br>  - So ... - continuing to squat, Sergey studied the resume.  - Something familiar ... What kind of plant? <br><br>  - I worked there.  - looking aside, Tatyana quietly said.  - I know this man.  This is ... He ... How to say something ... <br><br>  - Husband? <br><br>  - Not! <br><br>  - Lover? <br><br>  - What?  - Tatiana rose so abruptly that shaken blood poured into the head.  Or maybe not the blood rushed into her neat, pretty head. <br><br>  - So who?  - Sergey also rose and looked into Tatiana's eyes. <br><br>  ‚ÄúYou tell me ...‚Äù Tatyana babbled, gulping air and words.  - They decided the interrogation ... They did it ... <br><br>  - Of course not.  Just want to understand your motivation.  And help.  If you do not want, do not tell.  I am the grave, you know. <br><br>  - Yes.  - Tatiana sat down on a chair, leaned with both hands on the table and clutched her head with her hands, ruffling her hair.  - Ok, Sergey.  Although ... In general ... <br><br>  - Let me guess - it is something dear to you.  - Sergey sat down on a chair nearby.  - And you really want this guy ... Stop, I did not pay attention ... This is the guy? <br><br>  - Yes ... What ?!  - Sparks nearly fell from Tatyana‚Äôs eyes.  - What are you hinting at? <br><br>  - No matter what.  - Sergei, just in case, leaned a little back along with the chair, which issued an unpleasant creak.  - Whether it is not enough, the sister, or the aunt.  What did you think? <br><br>  - Nothing.  - Tatyana hissed viciously.  - Will you help, or not? <br><br>  - Of course.  Just let the standard procedure pass.  So that no one knew anything.  Do you agree? <br><br>  - Of course!  - Tatiana smiled uncertainly.  - So, I invite him? <br><br>  Sergey never ceased to wonder how quickly the mood of this girl was changing.  During the conversation - and this is a few minutes - she was thrown from a flicker of hope into the abyss of despair, from burning hatred to sincere sympathy, from hissing anger to unstoppable, breathless joy.  Either the actress is good, or the emotional lability (as it is called), or ... No, I can't see the stomach, and at lunch in the kitchen I eat borsch, not strawberries with smoked bacon. <br><br>  - Invite.  Where is he  Long away?  Can you drive up today? <br><br>  - Yes, he ... - Tatiana was a little embarrassed.  - Here already, in the parking lot, sitting in the car. <br><br>  - Well, now ... - Sergei took the summary from the table, found a phone number, dialed.  - Hello!  Eugene?  Hello, my name is Sergey Ivanov, director of development for the company ‚ÄúKub‚Äù.  Tatiana, HR Director ... Well, you know ... In short, she gave your resume, and I agree to examine you ... Not in the sense through a microscope ... In general, come in, it‚Äôs enough to be lost in the car.  There, ask the office manager how to find Sergey, I'm the only one here.  The password on the watch is ‚ÄúStar Fleet‚Äù.  Yes, a passport is not needed, just call the password.  All waiting. <br><br>  - Sergey, why did you call yourself?  - Tatiana asked hard. <br><br>  - Because I know you, Tatiana.  Especially since you are, well ... interested in the result.  You start smearing snot, oh my Zhenya, you only behave yourself, don't pay attention to this fool ... I promised you that I would take him to work.  Of course, if he is not a frank jerk.  But the CIO should be different from the others. <br><br>  - It would be better not ask.  - with a tired smile answered Tatyana.  - I, as I understand it, is forbidden to participate? <br><br>  - Yes, it is forbidden.  Although, did you still have time to tell him? <br><br>  - I said that there is nothing to tell, because I do not know anything. <br><br>  - Okay.  - Sergey conciliatory raised hands.  - Everything, Tatyana, goodbye.  See you in a couple of hours. <br><br>  Tatiana left the office.  Sergey, without losing time, once again quickly ran through the eyes of the summary.  Nothing suspicious - ordinary, useless, giving nothing and not particularly interfering with the CIO.  Sergey has long wanted to replace this post with a paperboard fool - as before, drawn cops were put on the roads.  It is cheap, it does not ask, it costs for years, but the people are still afraid.  Benefit, perhaps even more than from a living person in this position. <br><br>  Sergey's thoughts were interrupted by a knock at the door.  After the invitation to enter the office, the same Eugene appeared - quite young, in a decent suit, with hair laid (for which he immediately received a minus in karma from Sergey), and, of course, with a friendly smile on his face.  Probably, somewhere the courses of smiles passed, it was painfully ideal - moderately broad, but without a skewed face, showing preoccupation, but not up to a puppy squeal, with dignity.  Oh, those managers. <br><br>  - Hello.  - said Sergey, blurring in a smile - not because of etiquette, it was just a painful boy, sleek, pleasant and stylish, like an iPhone. <br><br>  - Good morning.  - quietly answered Eugene and pointed to the chair.  - Allow? <br><br>  - Yes of course. <br><br>  ‚ÄúSergey, I am grateful to you for that,‚Äù began Eugene.  - what‚Ä¶ <br><br>  - Blah blah blah.  - interrupted Sergey.  - Eugene, let's do without molasses.  I agreed to see you for one reason - Tatiana recommended.  She is my old friend, and I trust her opinion.  You have a resume - shit.  In the stream of the same shit, coming every day to the mail of Eycharov, I would not notice you.  But now you are hired for a one-day trial period.  However, you will have to pass the test. <br><br>  - Test?  - Eugene almost not taken aback.  - On knowledge? <br><br>  - What test, I will not say.  You will not need to fill out papers, answer questions, etc.  You will need to work as a Cube CIO for a couple of hours.  To solve real problems, show yourself from different sides.  Only I know the criteria for passing the test, so you will not receive any recommendations on behavior from anyone, not even from Tatiana.  You just work as you can, and I will observe.  Do you agree? <br><br>  ‚ÄúWhat kind of tasks?‚Äù  - Eugene squinted suspiciously. <br><br>  - Different kind.  - repeated Sergey.  - The usual IT directorial tasks that you have already solved many times.  Go to your workplace. <br><br>  Sergey resolutely got up and went to the exit.  Eugene, a little hesitated, got up and followed.  Having walked a couple of meters along the corridor, Sergey entered the empty room, looked around, and pointed to a chair in the middle of a long table. <br><br>  - Here is your workplace, sit down.  So the rules are simple.  You are the new CIO of the company.  I will now go and announce to everyone that the miracle has happened, and now the problems related to information technology will be solved again.  Also, I will indicate where you can be found.  It is likely that colleagues will come to you with tasks.  Next - sort it out yourself. <br><br>  - Is there a chance that no one will come?  - asked Eugene, sitting at the table. <br><br>  - There is.  - Sergey nodded.  - But do not hope for it.  All right, bye bye. <br><br>  And Sergey quickly disappeared from the negotiation.  Eugene fiddled a bit with his briefcase, deciding where to attach it, eventually put it on a nearby chair.  A few minutes later the door opened, and an unfamiliar woman entered. <br><br>  - Hello.  She said dryly.  - My name is Valeria, the chief accountant.  Are you a new IT manager? <br><br>  - CIO, to be precise.  - for some reason corrected Eugene.  - Sit down, Valeria, let's get acquainted! <br><br>  - Yes, fuck I do not need to get to know you.  - Valeria said, continuing to stand near the door. <br><br>  Eugene was a little confused and silent.  Valeria, unfortunately, was also silent, looking straight at the CIO.  Finally, when the pause began to drag on, Eugene decided to try again. <br><br>  ‚ÄúValeria ...‚Äù he began.  - How can I help you?  Given that I work in your company for a few minutes. <br><br>  - Yes, and you cannot help me in a year.  - the chief accountant continued to pour poison.  ‚ÄúThis moron who worked before you, Seryozha, our sun and moon, also could not help us.  All of you are idiots, all you can do is to nod at the accountants, and say that they are the hands-on hands that do not know how to do basic operations. <br><br>  - I ... - smiled Eugene.  - Valeria, I understand that you have a negative attitude towards the IT department, formed by the practice of communicating with programmers.  I assure you, I understand you perfectly.  But it will be different with me, I can find a common language with business users of the highest rank. <br><br>  ‚ÄúEvona is like ...‚Äù Valeria said.  - Well, let's find a common language with me. <br><br>  Valeria walked around the table, and sat down opposite Yevgeny. <br><br>  - Your program does not work.  - Valeria quoted several thousand accountants at once. <br><br>  - What exactly is not working?  And what program?  - the tone of Eugene expressed a sincere desire to help. <br><br>  - I have to explain this to you, which program is not working?  - suddenly cried the chief accountant.  - I am an accountant, not a programmer!  You are the programmer!  You need to know which program is not working! <br><br>  - There is a theory that there are errors in any, even the simplest program.  - Yevgeny answered uncertainly.  - You understand, Valeria, I just came.  Naturally, I do not even know which software park is used in your company.  How can I help with the program without even knowing its name? <br><br>  - That is, do not help?  - maliciously smiled Valeria. <br><br>  - Yes.  Stop ... Wait ... I will help, of course! <br><br>  - So help!  Your program does not work! <br><br>  - What kind of program? <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt begins ...‚Äù Valeria leaned back in her chair and folded her arms across her chest.  - All that can be achieved from IT specialists is a bunch of questions.  What program, and where is the error, and how to reproduce, and why are you doing it at all, and what is written in the accounting policy, and write me the TK, and how is it, and how is that ... Ugh! <br><br>  Valeria abruptly stood up ‚Äî so abruptly that the chair overturned ‚Äî and resolutely moved toward the door. <br><br>  - Valeria, wait!  - Eugene jumped up, ran to the door and leaned back against it, not giving the chief accountant to pass. <br><br>  - Let go!  - pussy malice, said Valeria. <br><br>  - I'll help you!  Well ... Damn ... You probably have 1C.  Yes, for sure 1C!  To know another version ... <br>  Valeria grinned angrily again.  She took the door handle and began to pull it, trying to push back the scented body of the CIO. <br><br>  - Yes, wait a minute ... - Eugene resisted for a few seconds, but still gave up and walked away. <br><br>  Valeria, looking strictly in front of her, with her eyebrows sternly pulled out of the conversation.  Eugene tiredly closed the door, dobled to his seat and fell into a chair.  The mood sharply became preparshivym, in the soul matured offense, hands trembled, eyes moistened a bit, like a young child, whose parents refused to listen, and just sent into a corner.  He stared blankly at the window, wondering if he could run away. <br><br>  - Hello.  - resounded from behind.  - Can? <br><br>  Eugene shuddered in surprise, then turned around and saw a young, incredibly cute girl of about twenty-five.  She was already standing inside the conversation, slowly closing the door behind her.  A brunette, in a snow-white blouse, with small buttons, some of which, and around the neckline, should be fastened with a button ‚Äî at least in the office.  The image is perfectly complemented by a tight black skirt to the knees and elegant glasses in thick black frames. <br><br>  The stranger, without waiting for the invitation, walked past Eugene, fanning him with the light aroma of unknown perfumes, and sat down beside him.  She was so close that the CIO saw her reflection in the lenses.  The girl slowly turned to Eugene, lightly touching his leg with his knees, and smiled gently. <br><br>  - Let's get acquainted?  She asked.  - My name is Zhenya.  And you? <br><br>  - Aaaa ... - the CIO was confused.  - This is ... Eugene. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWhat a coincidence ...‚Äù <br><br>  The girl‚Äôs voice seemed unreal, as if he sounded in Eugene right in his head, like music from high-quality in-ear headphones.  Confident, and at the same time - genuinely confused, with notes of healthy arrogance, and at the same time - with a fair amount of shyness, unfamiliar, but supposedly heard for many years in a row.  Eugene was unable to move, as if he was afraid to destroy this unusual, accidentally formed in his life, but such a wonderful moment.  I didn‚Äôt even move my leg away, continuing to feel the light and pleasant pressure of girl's knees. <br><br>  - Listen, Zhenya ... - continued the girl.  - I am very glad that you, exactly you, will work with us.  I think we will succeed.  I can feel it. <br><br>  Saying this, the girl lifted her head up, demonstrating an incredibly beautiful neck, as it seemed to Eugene.  Without obeying reason, his gaze slid lower, over a slightly stretched elastic skin ... <br><br>  - What the fuck? <br><br>  In surprise, Yevgeny jumped, almost knocking over a heavy negotiating table.  Turning around, he saw a hefty fellow, at least two meters tall and weighing perhaps one hundred and twenty pounds.  The face of the giant was decorated with two scars and a slightly beveled to the side of the nose - a boxer, thought Eugene. <br><br>  - What are you doing, yptyt?  - the giant threateningly attacked Eugene, looking straight into his eyes. <br><br>  - Anton, do not.  - without losing composure at all, Zhenya rose slowly from the chair.  ‚ÄúJust getting to know you.‚Äù  This is a new CIO. <br><br>  - Right now he will be old.  - Anton did not let up.  - Immediately retire.  You ohrenel, or what, squirrel?  Babu my glue on the first day of work.  I managed to survive, or what? <br><br>  ‚ÄúI ... I ...‚Äù began Eugene. <br><br>  - Head from the buoy!  - roared fellow.  - Bitch, once again I see, tear, do you understand? <br><br>  - Yes of course.  No, you thought wrong ... I just ... She ... <br><br>  - What?  Still say she is to blame! <br><br>  - No, of course ... <br><br>  - Then you are guilty?  - Anton suddenly smiled. <br><br>  - No, wait ... <br><br>  - What are you spinning like a worm under ultraviolet?  Pisanulsya bazaar, so answer! <br><br>  - Yes, you know, this is probably my fault.  - composure began to return to Eugene.  - Anton, I sincerely apologize to you for the situation I have created that allows for a double interpretation. <br><br>  - So that.  - Anton nodded.  - Marrying, let's go.  Right now, and you will get, mop ... Favorite. <br><br>  - Favorite mop?  - Eugene smiled.  - Yes, you are a master of compliments, Mr. Jubrak. <br><br>  - So, yptyt.  - proudly straightened Anton.  - Everything, moved. <br><br>  And a couple, playfully pushing each other and giggling, got out of the conversation. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWell your mother through the yoke, fucking farce.‚Äù  - Eugene swore in his voice, adding a few non-printable nouns and adjectives. <br><br>  He returned to his seat, nervously straightened his shirt, took off his jacket - after a hot conversation, he managed to sweat remarkably.  Without hesitation, he opened the window, letting the cold December air into the conversation, stood a little in the draft at the window sill until it began to freeze. <br><br>  Many thoughts flashed through my head, but very quickly this scattered flow turned into one, the main, all-consuming idea - to run.  Fell out of here without looking back.  I did not sign any documents, I did not give promises, no one will remember, they will not write in the resume, they will not spoil the recommendations.  Brad, idiocy, a collective farm, a complete ass.  Not so described the company "Cube" Tatiana.  But maybe you should not judge by the first day, even the first hour?  Worth it!  It is the first day that shows what the company is!  You can not put up with this, then it will only get worse. <br><br>  And this one, Sergey, probably sits and chuckles.  He himself escaped from this position, could not bear the load, now he is sitting in a big beautiful office and pretends to be engaged in development.  Already Eugene knew who in any company was the most useless person.  The one who in the post has the word "development".  Or "quality."  And also - ‚Äúprocess‚Äù. <br><br>  We must run.  Yes, immediately.  Eugene hastily put on his jacket, picked up a briefcase, pulled up chairs, and went to close the window. <br><br>  - Allow? <br><br>  ‚ÄúDamn, why is this door so silent?‚Äù  - thought Eugene.  Thank God, this time he did not jump in surprise, only started slightly. <br><br>  He turned around - a short young guy stood in the doorway, in jeans and a casually straightened checkered shirt.  His face was thickly covered with black bristles, his narrowed eyes fixed on Eugene.  This is probably like the girls, while in fashion Canadian lumberjacks. <br><br>  - Hello.  - the guy brazenly moved on a meeting and extended a hand for a greeting.  - Stas, a programmer.  And you are my new boss.  Eugene, right? <br><br>  - Right.  - nodded Eugene.  - Only this, Stanislav ... <br><br>  - Just Stas.  - the guy smiled incredibly friendly. <br><br>  - Well, just Stas.  I'm not sure I'll be your boss.  I have not yet decided whether to work for your company or not. <br><br>  - Let's discuss.  - said Stas, and quickly sat down on one of the chairs. <br><br>  After some hesitation, Eugene returned to his place - just opposite Stas.  Probably, he will endure another conversation, since he did not manage to escape imperceptibly. <br><br>  - I heard a lot about you, Eugene.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Stas somehow very closely watched the eyes of a new boss. - To be honest, I am very glad that you came to us. Even more than happy when Sergey left. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- rejoiced? - Eugene frowned incredulously. - Why? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Why how ?! - exclaimed Stas, as if the new chief knew the history of the famous IT department of the company ‚ÄúKub‚Äù perfectly. - Yes, because he is an idiot! Did you notice? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúTo be honest ...‚Äù began Eugene, but he stumbled. - While not an opinion. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Come on! But this idiotic quest that you pass, in your opinion, whose idea? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Sergey, he said this himself. - Eugene was all eager to understand where an excessively active programmer tends.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- So the most joke is that the results of this quest do not give a shit! - Stas, pleased with himself, leaned back in his chair. - I was just in the personnel department - I was instructed to hire you. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Stop ... - Eugene shook his head in confusion. - Why then is this all? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Yes, because he is a jerk! So sick, that sometimes it's easier for him to go on than to argue and prove. Even the owner is easier. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Wait, Stas ... </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- You can on "you." </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Wait, Stas ... If it doesn‚Äôt matter to everyone, and Sergey, as you say, well ... </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Fool camp. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúIt doesn't matter ... why are they keeping him?‚Äù </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Ooo-oh-oh ... - Stas stretched enough. - This is a very good question! The company ninety-nine percent of people will be happy to discuss it if you contact.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Well, all the same. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- I do not know. - Stas shrugged and smiled so sincerely that Eugene could not restrain himself, and smiled in response. - Once, a damn cloud years ago, we did a couple of cool projects with him. He, for this, became a CIO. Well, everything, in fact, here he broke the tower. Do not be surprised if he goes to the shrinkage. And if you do not go, then it's time to start. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- And what exactly began? - Eugene also leaned back in his chair and relaxed a bit.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Any crap. After those projects, he essentially did nothing more. More and more walks, whining, that everything is a goat, and he alone is D'Artagnan. I have read smart books - and, specifically, those that no one will ever take into his hands, specifically choose. And flaunts later, like I know a bunch of techniques, and I can improve any process, and even increase the profit of the whole company. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- But in reality? Can? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Who checked something? He only says that he can, and the rest - can not. And somehow this conversation ends. Who, in reality, will let him in to something serious? So he was sitting, that is, sitting in the IT department and squealing from there, that everything was somehow wrong and wrong. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Wait, Stas ... Why did he become development director then? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- About the principle of Peter heard?</font></font><br><br>  - Yes.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Wait ... This is about the fact that the work takes all the time allotted to it? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- No, this is Parkinson's law. Peter‚Äôs principle, literally, I don‚Äôt remember, but like this: a person climbs the career ladder until he reaches the point of his incompetence. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Yes, I heard something ... - Eugene left. - And how does this relate to Sergey? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- How? - genuinely surprised Stas. ‚ÄúWell, they just put him in this position so that he crap there, and you could safely throw it out!‚Äù If, at the very least, he managed to work as an IT director, because he was sitting on my neck, now he is naked like a falcon. He has no subordinates, no one listens to him, nobody cares about development projects. He is almost outside. Director of Development of him - no, zero. He has reached the level of his incompetence. Or rather, they helped him to do it. And his days are numbered.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúHmm ...‚Äù Evgeni frowned, but after a couple of seconds he suddenly smiled. - Then it is clear. Thank you, Stas! </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- You're welcome! Tomorrow, I hope, is it ok, let's talk in detail? And then we have - complete ass. This freak as dumped, and threw everything at me alone. Not even hello now, you bastard. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Yes, of course, tomorrow, Stas. - Eugene rose and extended his hand. - I am not like that, I am a man of action. I can even program. Work together!</font></font><br><br>  - Of course!<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Stas happily shook the hand of his boss, and with a decisive step moved to the door. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When he reached the door, he turned around, smiled very broadly again, and went out into the corridor. Eugene smiled. The situation turned a completely different side. We'll see who escapes from whom ... </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Suddenly the phone rang. The number seemed familiar, but it was not in the contacts. Eugene picked up the phone - it was Sergey. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Eugene, in fact, that's all. - said Sergey. ‚ÄúIn five minutes, let's get into my office.‚Äù Find the way? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Yes, it's close by, sort of. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Ok. I'm waiting!</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Eugene hastily picked up a briefcase, straightened his jacket, smoothed his hair with his hand and, having nothing to do, began to walk over the back and forth. Minutes dragged on for a long time, but I didn‚Äôt want to kill time with a smartphone, so as not to knock the right mood. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Finally, five minutes passed, and Eugene went out into the corridor. When he reached Sergei's door, he knocked confidently and, hearing the invitation, went inside. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Inside, besides the stupid development director, was Tatiana. Yevgeny smiled at her amiably, but in response, for the reason he did not understand, he received only frowning eyebrows and a pointed eye. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- So, Tatiana, you have to go. - Sergey pointed to the door. - Then we will talk without you. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Sergey, did you understand me? - strictly asked Tatyana. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Yes, do not worry. Do not want what you want.</font></font><br><br>  - Good.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- it was obvious that Tatyana doubted Sergey's answer, but Evgeny‚Äôs presence probably did not allow speaking openly. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Tatiana, slowly, left the office. Eugene, without waiting for an invitation, plopped down on a chair, in a businesslike manner, collapsed in it, unbuttoned his jacket and stared intently, without constraint, stared straight into Sergei's eyes. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Well, what is the result? - asked Eugene. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Awful. - Sergey smiled. - Actually, as always. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- In terms of? - the candidate suddenly became serious and sat up straight. - What is terrible? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- You passed the test terribly. Even worse than other candidates. - Sergey continued to smile. - But, nevertheless, regardless of the results, you will be recruited to our company.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For a few seconds, Eugene carefully looked at Sergei, trying to understand the reason for his smile. If the test does not mean anything, and Sergey knows this, then what does he bloom like a Mayan rose? Although ... If he is really that, kuku, then a smile may not be at all connected with what is happening around. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Being satisfied with this explanation, Eugene again relaxed and broke into a contented smile. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Actually, that's all. - summed up Sergey. - Further to you ... </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Wait a minute ... - Eugene interrupted him, raising his palm. - Maybe explain the meaning of this your test? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Hmm, I thought, do not ask ... Okay. What do you think was happening in the meeting room while you were there? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Well, as I understand it, people came to me with problems, with painful problems that no one ... Well, until there was a CIO, no one solved.</font></font><br><br>  - Not.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They came to you with games. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- What games? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- With corporate. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- I do not understand ... </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Well ... There is work, but there is a game. The higher the position, the more games. The CIO often gets a lot of games, because this is the position - you really need to interact with almost all departments. So I wanted to see how you figure it out with these games. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- And How? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- None. - Sergey shrugged his shoulders. - You started to play them. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- In terms of? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Well, Valeria, our chief accountant, came to you and played the favorite game of her profession - ‚Äúyour program does not work‚Äù. You understand the inadequacy of this statement?</font></font><br><br>  - Of course.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- without thinking, Yevgeny nodded. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- And she understands. And everyone understands. The game has three options for development. First - you play and lose. The chief accountant convinces everyone that you are a horseman, and you can hang any crap on you, and you will swallow and perform. It happens very often. The second option - you play and win. Convince everyone else that the chief accountant is an inadequate fool, and you are a good fellow, because you brought her to clean water. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- And the third option? - asked Eugene, when Sergei suddenly stopped talking. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- The third option is not to play the game. The best scenario, especially for a CIO. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- It's like, do not play the game? - Yevgeny was perplexed. - How does it look in practice?</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- In practice, this is a quick withdrawal, or withdrawal to the side. Like in aikido. You depart, and the attacker just flies in the direction to which he directed the energy. Or - the conscious direction of the game by itself. Well, the last option is to abruptly interrupt the game. So you could do with Stas, for example. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- In terms of? - Yevgeny goggled dumbfounded. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúWell, did he come to tell you what kind of idiot I am?‚Äù </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- I ... </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Yes, I know. - Sergey waved his hand. - Not in detail, but I know. All the roles, words and scenarios for the game I came up with myself. You did not think that I should go to the shrinkage? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- No, of course ... - Eugene was covered with perspiration. - And in general, this Stas ... </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Careful! - Sergey interrupted him. - First, you work with him. Secondly, you are trying to play with me right now. I do not advise.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- No, of course ... Just wanted to say that he is an interesting guy. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- We are all interesting here. - Sergey shrugged his shoulders. - To you, I think ... </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Suddenly, Sergei's smartphone vibrated on the table. Apologizing, he quickly grabbed the device, read the message and suddenly smiled broadly. A little more picking on the smartphone, put it back on the table. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúSo ...‚Äù continued Sergey. - Listen to my advice. I climbed here from the bottom. He came here as a programmer, then became a CIO, now I am a deputy. general development. The third person in the company. Do you know the secret of my success? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Do not play games?</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- It is rather a necessary condition for success. There is a more accurate wording - I do not play other people's games, but I start my own. Your own game is much better, especially if you play it alone. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- That is how it is ... One ... </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Well, like that. You do something for which no one undertakes. You carry out development projects for which no one has time. You study business literature while the rest read all sorts of nonsense on the Internet. Even, damn it, you ask to raise your salary while the others are shy. Heard about such a technique - career rush? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- No, to be honest ... </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Well, read it at your leisure. Only here do not use here - everyone knows about it.</font></font><br><br>  - Good. <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Here you go. When you started a game in which only you are alone, you will never lose. You can only not win, but it's not scary. Actually, this is the whole secret. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Eugene was silent, something intensely thinking. Sergey, having nothing to do, reached for the smartphone, when suddenly he seemed to remember something. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúYes, Eugene ...‚Äù he began. - There is one news, I do not know how to react. They just wrote to me here that Tatiana ... In general, she will be fired soon. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- How are you fired? - Eugene rounded his eyes. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- So like this. - Sergey shrugged his shoulders. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt cope, I probably don‚Äôt know ... I‚Äôm not sideways, I‚Äôd just been warned not to start new projects with it.‚Äù And, given the circumstances, I decided to inform you. Suddenly it will affect your decision.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Eugene was silent. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">His eyes quickly ran around the office, his expression was extremely intense and focused, when suddenly ... He smiled. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- What? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Squinting, Sergey asked. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Affect, all the same?</font></font><br><br>  - Yes.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Eugene's tension, suddenly, like a hand lifted. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- I will be happy to work in your company. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- So this is ... - Sergey frowned. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- You are with her, as I understood ... I know ... It seems, even personally. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- So what? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- shrugged Eugene. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- I ... You know, Sergey ... I am even glad that it happened.</font></font><br><br>  - Why? <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - Well ... I do not know how to say ... Tatiana, she, in general ... </font></font><br><br>  - What? <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Well ... Let's just say ... I do not have the same feelings for her as she has for me. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Does she know about it? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- No, of course you are. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- So how is this ‚Äúno, of course‚Äù? You are cute to a girl, but she‚Äôs not to you, but you tell her that you reciprocate? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Well, everything is more complicated there ... I ... How would I say this ... </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Ok, I understood. - broke off the torment of a new colleague Sergey. - There is deeply personal, and between us is not the level of confidence to tell. I respect your right and demand nothing.</font></font><br><br>  - Thank.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Eugene breathed a sigh of relief. - I'm so tired, to be honest, from your ... Ie games you have organized ... </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Well, because you played them. - Sergey got up, showing with his appearance that it was time for Eugene. - But if they didn‚Äôt play, they would be as fresh as a cucumber. Okay, Eugene ... </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Yes, yes ... - Eugene hastily jumped up, picked up a briefcase and extended his hand to Sergey. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Take a break from the games, if possible. - with a strange smile said Sergei. - But remember that games never end. At any moment it is important to understand whether you are in the game or not, and in whose game.</font></font> Good? <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Yes of course. - Evgeny nodded. - Till tomorrow? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Yes, see you tommorow. If anything changes, I'll call. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- In terms of? - smile disappeared from the face of Eugene. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Standard phrase, do not pay attention. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Oh good! </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Eugene left the office, and Sergei returned to the table. He picked up the smartphone, brought it to his ear. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Tatiana, are you here? Ah, well ... Yes ... You do not roar, damn ... I told you, but you did not believe ... No, I will not come, I am afraid of female tears ... And, I do not know ... What do you think, to take? .. No, I would not take it, it was too stupid and simple, just for your sake ... Ah, decide for yourself ... Exactly? .. Well, well. Call yourself? .. I can, of course. But not now, but after a couple of hours. I will say that the general rejected ... All right, come to your senses, we need to work.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Sergey casually threw the smartphone on the table, leaned back in his chair, closed his eyes and sang quietly: </font></font><br><br>  Hey!  I am a villain for them, <br>  Knowledgeable secret <br>  Low passions <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Beggars and kings. </font></font><br>  I was a violinist <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> My talent is my cross </font></font><br>  Life and bow <br>  I played with fire! <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Dopev, smiled to himself, jumped out of his chair, and with an energetic gait moved into the corridor. </font></font></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/458960/">https://habr.com/ru/post/458960/</a></p>
