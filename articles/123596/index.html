Errata, errors and other problems of quality of implementation can "blur" the process of executing test scenarios. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/workflow.html">Workflow Expectations - Presenting Steps at the Right Time</a></strong> <br>  Jakob Nielsen writes about his company's research on user experience for specific scenarios.  He notes that in the case of a sequence of actions, it is important not only the contents of the current screen, but also what was in the process before and after it. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2011/04/when-interviews-go-wrong.php">When Interviews Go Wrong</a></strong> <br>  Mia Northrop tips in case a user interview doesn‚Äôt go as planned.  It describes the types of respondents and the characteristics of each of them, as well as ways to solve common problems. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm%3Fid%3D1968203">Mobile Application Development - Web vs Native</a></strong> <br>  Although the article is somewhere between the development and design of interfaces, it will be useful for designers to answer the question "in what form to offer your service for mobile - an adapted site or application? <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://boxesandarrows.com/view/novices-orienteer">Novices Orienteer, Experts Teleport</a></strong> <br>  Tyler Tate describes the difference in information retrieval principles used by novices and experienced users.  Understanding these differences will help make search interfaces convenient for both groups of users. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.uie.com/articles/expect-the-unexpected">What to Expect When You're Not Expecting It</a></strong> <br>  Julie Norviasas and Steve Portigal share stories about unplanned user research results.

The main message is to make it as linear as possible and avoid obscure steps.  The article is based on the extensive Baymard Institute study (http://baymard.com/checkout-usability). <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/04/04/multivariate-testing-101-a-scientific-method-of-optimizing-design/">Multivariate Testing 101 - A Scientific Method Of Optimizing Design</a></strong> <br>  Paras Chopra from Visual Website Optimizer describes in detail the process and methods of multi-variant testing.  The article leads a lot of good practices and case studies. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.gabrielweinberg.com/blog/2011/04/toddler-app-user-interface-guidelines.html">Toddler app user interface guidelines</a></strong> <br>  Although the conclusions of the article are based on a sample of one child, it will be no less useful for designers of children's iPad applications.  The author lists 14 rules that must be considered when creating such an interface. <br><br><h3>  Instruments </h3><br>  <strong><a href="http://glechyan.blogspot.com/2011/04/iphone-visio.html">iPhone Template for Visio</a></strong> <br>  A well-developed library for designing iPhone applications in MS Visio by Gevorg Glechyan.

Does it help increase conversion or is it just another pointless fashion? <br><br><h2>  Process </h2><br>  <strong><a href="http://johnnyholland.org/2011/05/02/checklist-thinking-for-ux-professionals-retaining-your-sanity-in-a-complex-project/">‚ÄúChecklist Thinking‚Äù for UX Professionals - Retaining your sanity in a complex project</a></strong> <br>  Greg Laugero describes the design process based on checklists.  It improves the final quality of the product due to more reliable consideration of requirements. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.lostgarden.com/2011/05/game-design-logs.html">Game Design Logs</a></strong> <br>  An interesting approach to game design in the agile process, which will be of interest to designers.  It involves the creation of a series of prototypes and their continuous improvement. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://blog.semanticfoundry.com/2011/04/30/introduction-to-design-studio-methodology/">Introduction to Design Studio Methodology</a></strong> <br>  Will Evans from Semantic Foundry describes the process and features of the ‚ÄúDesign Studio Methodology‚Äù training.  He assumes carrying out of participants on all stages of creation of a product - from research and the first sketches to the presentation and the subsequent completions. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.cooper.com/journal/2011/04/great_creative_partnership_pai.html">Better together;</a></strong>  <strong><a href="http://www.cooper.com/journal/2011/04/great_creative_partnership_pai.html">the practice of successful creative collaboration</a></strong> <br>  Stefan Klocek, one of the employees of Cooper Consulting, describes the design and design gameplay built by the company.  One of its key features are the pair work of designers and fast iterations. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://uxmag.com/strategy/why-we-need-storytellers-at-the-heart-of-product-development">Why We Need Storytellers at the Heart of Product Development</a></strong> <br>  Sarah Doody writes about the importance of the role of the storyteller in describing and supporting the vision of the product.  Such a specialist helps to rally the team around a single idea and get a better product in the end. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://uxmag.com/design/the-elements-of-player-experience">The Elements of Player Experience</a></strong> <br>  John Ferrara offers his own variation of the well-known UX model from Jesse James Garrett, which must be used for using game mechanics interfaces.  It consists of 5 layers - motivation, intelligible alternatives, balance, usability and aesthetics. <br><br><h2>  Cases </h2><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/ipad.html">iPad Usability: Year One</a></strong> <br>  A year ago, the Nielsen / Norman Group conducted a <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/reports/mobile/ipad/">study on the usability of the just-released iPad</a> , accompanied by criticism of many interface solutions.  Over the past year, the situation has changed and repeated research has shown the best results. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://liftlab.com/think/nova/2011/04/13/co-creation-workshop-with-nokia-research-during-lift-11/">Co-creation workshop with Nokia Research during Lift 11</a></strong> <br>  During the Lift 11 conference, researchers from the Nokia Research Center conducted a master class on the design of mobile interfaces.  The main emphasis was placed on the current context.  Direct <a href="http://liftconference.com/files/nokiaresearch-workshop-final.pdf">link to the report</a> (PDF). <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://kaishinlab.com/tweetbot-vs-twitter/">UI Showdown - Tweetbot vs Twitter App</a></strong> <br>  An interesting attempt to compare two similarly designed mobile applications using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOMS">GOMS</a> interface efficiency calculation method (Goals, Operators, Methods, and Selection rules).  Although the article itself was criticized by many experts in the industry, the idea itself is unusual and deserves attention. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2778-design-decisions-basecamp-mobile-ui">Design Decisions - Basecamp mobile UI</a></strong> <br>  A well-illustrated case in which 37 Signals employees describe the process of creating a mobile version of a Basecamp product.  The article shows a step by step movement from a common vision to a final decision. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.90percentofeverything.com/2011/04/10/alan-penn-on-shop-floor-plan-design-ikea-and-dark-patterns/">Ikea, and Dark Patterns</a></strong> <br>  Although this article is not entirely about design, it describes extremely interesting examples of building stores and shopping centers.  In these cases, the architects paid special attention to the decision-making process of the buyer, as well as ways to influence it. <br><br><h2>  Theory </h2><br>  <strong><a href="http://boxesandarrows.com/view/are-your-users-s-t-u">Are your users STUPID?</a></strong> <br>  Stephen Turbek talks about how to turn users from STUPID (stressed, tired, untrained, passive, independent, distracted) into SMART (simplify, memorable, accept autopilot, recovery, test in realistic situations). <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://uxmovement.com/buttons/why-users-click-right-call-to-actions-more-than-left-ones">Than Left Ones</a></strong> <br>  The article focuses on the reasons why it is worth placing the call-to-action buttons on the right.  The argument about whether to put them on the left or on the right is a long-standing one and is unlikely to end soon, but this article is a good rationale for supporters of the second option. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://upassoc.org/upa_publications/jus/2011may/owens1.html">Text Advertising Blindness - The New Banner Blindness?</a></strong> <br>  The study of Justin W. Owens, Barbara S. Chaparro and Evan M. Palmer, which focuses on ‚Äútext advertising immunity‚Äù - the new ‚Äúbanner blindness‚Äù.  Located in the typical for such advertising information worse perceived and more difficult to find users. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2011/04/there-should-be-limits-to-usability.php">There Should Be Limits to Usability</a></strong> <br>  Peter Hornsby goes against the established views of designers and says that in some cases, usability should be left in the background.  Usability is not always useful for the product and research data in the article confirm this promise. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2011/04/user-research-is-unnatural-but-thats-okay-part-i.php">User Research Is Unnatural (But That's Okay)</a></strong> <br>  A series of articles by Jim Ross, in which he describes the problems and limitations of user research ‚Äî they often occur in unnatural conditions for the respondent, which leads to controversial results and conclusions.  The author offers solutions for some of these problems.  The <a href="http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2011/04/user-research-is-unnatural-part-ii-making-user-research-more-natural.php">second part of the article</a> is also available. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://understandinggraphics.com/brainy/understanding-schematic-faces/">The Visual Language of Schematic Faces</a></strong> <br>  Article Connie Malamed, in which she describes the features of the perception of schematic images of persons.  Interestingly, even conventional images are powerful images that can be used in interfaces. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://johnnyholland.org/2011/04/28/the-theory-behind-social-interaction-design/">The Theory Behind Social Interaction Design</a></strong> <br>  Adrian Chan describes the basic principles behind the design of interfaces for social services and networks.  He cites the rationale for many features of behavior from sociology and psychology. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://uxmag.com/design/cognitive-styles">Cognitive Styles - Get inside your head</a></strong> <br>  Tyler Tate talks about two principles of perception - analytical and complex (holistic).  They determine how a particular person works with information. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://piim.newschool.edu/journal/issues/2011/02/">Parsons Journal for Information Mapping, volume 3, Issue 2</a></strong> <br>  The latest issue of PJIM magazine, which explores the possibilities of data visualization as a tool for presenting information for decision-making.  First of all, the features of filing complex business processes and customer behavior scenarios are affected. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2011/04/how-shortcut-decision-strategies-affect-decision-outcomes.php">How Shortcut Decision Strategies Affect Decision Outcomes</a></strong> <br>  Another article Colleen Roller on the features of user behavior.  It describes the principles of decision making in a simplified choice. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://johnnyholland.org/2011/03/23/motion-and-the-clay-of-interaction-design/">Motion and The Clay of Interaction Design</a></strong> <br>  David Malouf explores the issue of animation in modern touch interfaces.  He asks the question - can it be that some animation techniques are more aesthetically pleasing than others?  And how can we use this when building interfaces. <br><br><h2>  Story </h2><br>  <strong><a href="http://theixdlibrary.com/hisotry/alan-kay-on-the-history-of-the-user-interface/">Alan Kay lecture @ Apple 1987 - Doing with Images Makes Symbols (Video)</a></strong> <br>  Alan Kay's 50-minute lecture (Apple, ex-Xerox PARC) on graphical user interfaces, recorded at 1987 in Apple. <br><br><h2>  Trends </h2><br>  <strong><a href="http://mkruzeniski.posterous.com/how-print-design-is-the-future-of-interaction">How Print Design is the Future of Interaction</a></strong> <br>  Mike Kruzeniski examines examples of how print design affects the modern web.  Despite the fact that the first experiments in the 90s were clumsy and poorly took into account the features of the online environment, now this area is one of the key trends. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.cxpartners.co.uk/thoughts/the-edge-in-ecommerce-emotion.htm">The edge in eCommerce - emotion</a></strong> <br>  Joe Leech from CXPartners describes the use of the emotional component in e-commerce.  Many western websites have already fulfilled all standard usability guidelines and are looking for new ways to increase sales. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://johnnyholland.org/2011/04/18/the-ixd-bauhaus-what-happens-next/">The 'IxD Bauhaus' - What happens next?</a></strong> <br>  Rauh Sen writes about the ‚Äúnew Bauhaus‚Äù in the field of interfaces.  These are new approaches that emphasize the functional component, rather than the scenery. <br><br>  <em>Fresh links can also be tracked in <a href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php%3Fsk%3Dgroup_173955382668026%26amp%3Bap%3D1">the Facebook group of the same name</a> or in the <a href="http://friendfeed.com/uxroom">Friendfeed User Experience ribbon</a> .</em> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/123596/">https://habr.com/ru/post/123596/</a></p>
