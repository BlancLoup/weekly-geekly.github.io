  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Infosphere: ways to influence information on a person</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The institute is finished.  Looking through different files, I found an article for one scientific conference.  I remembered how I liked her in the 3rd year, I compiled it myself, without finding sensible sources.  Everything from the head, impressed by the <a href="http://www.world-art.ru/animation/animation.php%3Fid%3D38">Phantom in the armor</a> <br><br>  Most modern researchers pay considerable attention to the ways of presenting information.  Where, when, how and how much.  This part of the human impact through the infosphere is well studied and developed.  However, an equally important part - the perception of information by a person from the point of view of the ways to obtain it - is practically not disclosed.  If you succeed in understanding this process, you can increase the efficiency of communicating knowledge and information to the final recipient, for example, the buyer. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The individual's infosphere is divided in real time into 2 components.

      External information.  It is the most important part in terms of human exposure.  The physiological channels of delivering external information to a person are his five types of feelings (sight, hearing, smell, touch, taste).  So, after processing based on our experience, it is built into certain data: we see a ‚Äútree‚Äù with green leaves and hear ‚Äúmusic‚Äù from a nearby car.  Or, less clearly, by looking at the poster with the name of the company and the young people in its background, we can come to the conclusion that the products of this organization are intended for young people. <br><br>  However, the conclusion in such a situation depends on the next element of the individual's infosphere - his filtering experience.  His synonyms are partly the opinion of a person, intuition.  It is based on previously obtained knowledge of a person, which, at the time of receiving external information, forms a certain aggregate of relevant retrospective information.  This set is a reference for man.  This prioritization occurs because, according to previous knowledge of a person, a particular phenomenon should be like that.  He was taught this way, such experience was available in life or he is inclined to trust / not trust this source of information.  Naturally, the filtering experience is rather subjective.  It is quite likely that it may be ‚Äúwrong‚Äù based on incorrect information.  It also depends heavily on the culture of which the person is a part. <br><br>  Next, a comparison of information takes place in order to assess the quality of external information.  If, when reconciled, external information coincides or is close to internal, then it is estimated as reliable.  If the external information contradicts the internal, then it will most likely be turned away.  However, it is necessary to take into account the relationship of man to the sources.  So, if the external source is more authoritative for it, then the internal filter can be adjusted.  Also, this happens when repeatedly receiving external information that contradicts the filtering experience, a person begins to understand that previous knowledge was wrong.  Or think accordingly.  It is also worth noting here that the adjustment can occur in a ‚Äúwrong‚Äù direction that does not correspond to the truth. <br><br>  Also do not forget about the effect of indirect experience.  If a person is smart and can analyze and think logically, comparing sometimes unrelated processes, then he will be able to block external information from his point of view.  Otherwise, if in totalitarian countries with active propaganda there were no desedants. <br><br>  From this approach, it follows that for the most effective reporting of information, it is necessary to take into account the filtering experience of the target group.  If it does not allow to evaluate the information emanating from us, as qualitative and reliable, then it must be corrected.  For example, if we want buyers to agree to spend more money on the fact that the product was made from environmentally friendly raw materials, we must first convince them that this is for themselves better.  That is, we have to change the filtering experience of potential buyers from ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need it‚Äù to ‚Äúit‚Äôs more useful and worth the additional cost‚Äù through articles, scientists ‚Äôpresentations and other ways. <br><br>  If the topic is interesting, tell me some materials on which you can develop your knowledge in it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/65338/">https://habr.com/ru/post/65338/</a></p>
