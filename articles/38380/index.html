Language "always obeys the laws of its internal logic, - a sophisticated, changeable, whimsical language, forever updated and immortal like life."  And most importantly, the purity of the language - not just a language problem.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  The book is devoted to the analysis of imaginary and genuine diseases of the Russian language.  At the time of Chukovsky, she was relevant and did not lose a bit even after 40 years. <br><br>  Korney Chukovsky sees the seven main problems of the Russian language that concern his readers: foreigners, vulgarisms, weediness with dialects and vice versa, their expulsion from their speech, sanctimonious tastes, <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2586%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258F%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582">clerical</a> and complex words. <br><br>  Some of these problems today are exhausted.  I think that complex words that were carried away in the Soviet era, for example, the deformity of <em>Obluprpromproducts</em> , died on their own.  Only viable human constructions remained: <em>TYUZ, ZAGS, VUZ</em> , and all sorts of <em>scrubs</em> (school worker) have long been forgotten. <br><br>  He managed to reconcile me with the word <em>manager</em> : ‚Äúnot that language is really strong, original, rich, which fearfully shies away from every alien word, but the one who, having taken this alien word, creatively transforms it, self-dominatingly subordinating its own will, own aesthetic tastes and requirements so that the word takes on a new, expressive form that it did not have in its language. ‚Äù <br><br>  Chukovsky helped me to understand why I am cool about the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8">padonkoff</a> language: ‚Äúthis is a struggle not against the word, but against what is behind it: against spiritual emptiness, against an attempt to silence the holes of thought and conscience‚Äù. <br><br>  I am amused by the chapter where the author speaks about the language of youth.  I was surprised that the word <em>dude</em> in our understanding for more than 40 years, or before our <em>zhzhot</em> sounded like <em>soot</em> .  I also found an attractive phrase: <em>‚ÄúLet's meet on Tverbul at Pampushkin‚Äù</em> , which means Tverskoy Boulevard at the Pushkin Monument.  However, Chukovsky believes that this vocabulary is determined by the "low level of spiritual culture," although he immediately cites several reasonable arguments against. <br><br>  And, one of the main problems, the bureaucracy, which is now blooming and flourishing.  I was upset that, reading some examples, I did not find anything terrible in them, so used to it.  It is regrettable that he is popular outside the bureaucratic environment: in business, study, science, etc.  Textbooks are constantly coming across, consisting of 90% of bulky common phrases.  I myself try to avoid stupid unnecessary constructions in business, especially in personal correspondence, <em>taking into account the above, with regard to, it is impossible not to mention</em> others.  According to Chukovsky, behind the clerk hides "disregard for the fate of people and things."  This sample language kills and does not allow to convey even the ‚Äúmost sincere, unfeigned feeling‚Äù.  To defeat him will turn out only "expelling bureaucracy from human relations and everyday life." <br><br>  Probably, it is already clear that I liked the book ‚ÄúLiving as Life‚Äù.  This is a wonderful, terribly interesting, comprehensive and relevant work that I can, with a clear conscience, recommend to anyone who loves the Russian language.  She made me pay more attention to what and how I speak and write, and what feelings and attitudes lie behind this. <br><br>  <strong>"In it [Russian] all tones and shades, all transitions of sounds from the hardest to the most gentle and soft, it is limitless and can, alive as life, be enriched every minute."</strong>  Gogol </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/38380/">https://habr.com/ru/post/38380/</a></p>
