Even the emergence of such competitors as <a href="http://www.asana.com/">Asana</a> , <a href="http://www.teamlab.com/ru">Teamlab</a> , <a href="http://www.trello.com/">Trello</a> and <a href="http://www.podio.com/">Podio</a> did not knock them off the course.  Here, of course, it remains only to applaud while standing. <br><br>  Basecamp could not only withstand the test of time (8 years - not a small time, you will agree), but also trends.  For example, the developers until the last time ignored the trend and preferred the mobile version to native applications.  Knowing Basecamp for a long time, I want to think that the guys were in no hurry just because they wanted to do everything as it should, and now - drum roll - on February 8, the <b>first official iOS Basecamp application</b> got to the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id599139477">App Store</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Yes, yes, Basecamp could be used for a long time through a mobile browser, moreover, there is not a single <a href="http://basecamp.com/extras">third-party application for</a> both iOS and Android, but the quality ... you understand, and not everyone is <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id553742298">happy with the</a> cost ( <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id553742298">SuitChamp</a> , for example, costs $ 7 )

      Another drum roll: the <b>application released by 37 signals is absolutely free</b> and at first glance makes a good impression: fast, easy to use, and the design does not leave any chance for third-party applications.  The application looks a little different from the Basecamp mobile interface, which 37 signals released <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3257-backstage-basecamp-for-mobile">last fall,</a> so users can easily view their projects, conduct discussions with colleagues, view tasks and delete them from to-do lists, attach files, read and add comments. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/719/f25/829/719f258295ad9bf7feeb70d55e005ba8.jpg"><br><br>  In general, it is safe to say that this application is one of the most awaited for Basecamp users, not only because it was developed by the same people as the original. <br><br>  Through the application, you can also work with the recently announced <a href="https://basecamp.com/personal">Basecamp Personal</a> .  For those who missed the news: this is the version of Basecamp for personal use, which is paid 1 time with the condition that you only have 1 project (before that, the main target audience of Basecamp was a small business, and the fee was monthly).  Basecamp Personal costs $ 25. <br><br>  For a long time, the signal service team assured that it does not plan to go further than the mobile version for its product, which by itself was an excellent guarantee for third-party developers who did not want to compete with the company's founder.  Now, they must be in a difficult situation, because Basecamp users no longer have any reason to look at the ‚Äúside‚Äù. <br><br>  But let's about the (potential) fly in the ointment.  The mobile application works only with the projects of the "new" Basecamp.  That is, with everything that you have created after a <a href="http://basecamp.com/new">big reboot</a> in early 2012.  "Great luck" for those who use <a href="http://basecamp.com/classic">Basecamp Classic</a> - the old version of the platform!  Why is that?  According to the developers, the point, of course, is not that the users of the old version flew out of their heads, but simply the new design seems to them much more convenient from the point of view of usability.  But we understand that the main reason is to motivate to create accounts in the new version of the platform. <br><br>  Are you a loyal user of the classic version?  Well, at your disposal is still a mobile version and applications released by third-party developers.  This is probably the only ray of light for <a href="http://getcampapp.com/">Camp-</a> type products, which was released a day before the official release of 37 signals. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c7a/bfe/d25/c7abfed25e13f655a59bd34fdaa444cf.jpeg"><br><br>  But wait ... Camp doesn't work with the old Basecamp either!  Oh no no no( <br><br>  Let's summarize: a new product from the 37signals team looks great and, apparently, most users will want to use it as soon as possible on their IPhones.  Basecamp and without a mobile application had the status of a leader in the field of project management, and with the latest release, it seems, the product and will not be equal.  Although stop, you need more the same for Android ... <br>  According to the founder of 37 signals, they have already thought about it) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/195/63a/f37/19563af37a62c9a02426c8f4fba17270.jpg"><br><br>  Look for the mobile app from the creators of Basecamp <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id599139477">here</a> <br><br>  <i>* This is a free translation of the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/08/after-8-years-on-the-web-project-management-platform-basecamp-finally-launches-an-official-ios-app/">news</a> published on TechCrunch on February 8</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/168907/">https://habr.com/ru/post/168907/</a></p>
