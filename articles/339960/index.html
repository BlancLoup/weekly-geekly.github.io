We decided to share with readers of the Mars IS blog about the unique event, which allows you to be aware of the latest trends, get acquainted with the best practitioners and communicate not only with the manufacturer and its contractors, but also with other users of the platform. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/df/3a/59df3a629fffd246373340.jpeg"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  In the wake of "Star Wars" </h2><br>  This year, more than 15 thousand people, 160 sponsors and partners from different parts of the world participated in the annual conference, which was held in Orlando (Florida, USA) in May.  The main purpose of the event is to give them the opportunity to share with each other the experience of implementing and operating its service platform. <br><br>  The conference was held at the huge exhibition complex of the Orange County Convention Center.  It is curious that every year it hosts the main event for Star Wars fans - Star Wars Celebration.  This year, fans of the famous film saga gathered in Orlando in mid-April.

    <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/df/3a/59df3a75ab07c911046226.jpeg"></div><br>  The center was divided into several zones: separate lectures and huge laboratory classes.  We really liked that not only the leaders and developers of ServiceNow spoke at the conference, but also partner companies, including Accenture, Ernst &amp; Young, KPMG, Fujitsu and Crossfuze.  The users of the ServiceNow platform had the opportunity to share their implementation experience, talk about their mistakes and achievements. <br><br>  Every morning began with a speech by top managers of ServiceNow.  They talked about their vision for the future of the platform, upcoming releases and much more.  You can read the performances on <a href="https://knowledge.servicenow.com/video-library.html%3Ftab%3Dit">the company's website</a> or look in the frame right here: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gBa3eiAmKgA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h2>  Corporate IT Management </h2><br>  ServiceNow is not just a platform for managing IT services.  It allows you to fully integrate all the service systems with each other and manage the infrastructure of an enterprise of any size. <br><br>  The ESM concept underlying the platform suggests that the multitude of ideas, tools and processes that are used in ITSM can be used by any organization departments that provide services, in particular, human resources, financial and legal services. <br><br>  In fact, all service departments of any company need to manage incidents and problems, fulfill service requests and interact with customers.  The idea is to develop universal tools, processes and approaches to provide corporate services.  A single platform is able to manage support, development, business resources and provide analytics for making quality management decisions. <br><br><h2>  Mars is accelerating with ServiceNow </h2><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/df/3a/59df3a4c5f202585708074.jpeg"></div><br>  Mars is actively investing in corporate governance.  The introduction of ServiceNow for IT process management began in 2014.  The project team was distributed worldwide, and the project management office was created in Russia - a unique case for such a large-scale implementation.  A year later, a number of ITSM modules were launched: change, configuration, incident, problem, knowledge management processes, as well as a service catalog and self-service portal for 70,000 internal Mars users. <br><br>  This immediately accelerated the passage of a number of processes.  For example, earlier the task of allocating a server in the Data Center was processed for several months.  It was a manual process, requiring several stages of negotiation and displeasing users due to possible delays.  Now, both server input and output are fully automated and consist of a service call to ServiceNow and a thoughtful chain of tasks, including requests for approval and automated server allocation. <br><br>  That is why the possibilities of ServiceNow in the field of automation, artificial intelligence and deep analytics are of great interest.  In the new release, the company announces Intelligent Automation Engine, which is able to predict anomalies and detect incidents before they appear. <br><br><h2>  Fantasy?  No, already reality! </h2><br>  Examples were shown in Orlando to prevent the stopping of production processes due to the fall of a critical business application at the stage of early deviations of the usual indicators of server equipment.  Work in this direction is one of the strategic objectives of the field of IT-operations. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/df/3a/59df3a24a8539117251481.jpeg"></div><br>  We give an example from the area of ‚Äã‚Äãcustomer service management (Customer Service Management).  On ordinary days, ten users call, but 50 calls are started.  And on certain days, a thousand users call, but only one call starts.  The system automatically detects the anomaly, analyzes it on a large sample of data and creates an incident so that the support staff can analyze the state of the associated systems. <br><br>  The conference was also presented many unusual designs.  In particular, the drone integrated with ServiceNow is able to fly around a certain area, scan it and send incidents if inconsistencies are detected.  A headset and augmented reality glasses allow you to start incidents based on key concepts that come to mind.  This is a fantasy that has become a reality: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GNbQ2UnaS34" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The event was very clearly shown the process of hiring new employees.  ServiceNow allows you to step by step build the process of involving all the necessary departments (personnel, security, hiring manager, local IT team, etc.), allowing you to create all the accounts and prepare your computer and telephone even before the new person arrives: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BXT96JdDmCA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Communication with colleagues helped us to identify the main mistakes that we made while introducing the platform, and to understand what can be fixed in the near future.  And also make new acquaintances, are among the first to find out about the updates to ServiceNow and get a huge amount of useful information.  And next week we will tell in our blog about the Service Introduction process. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/339960/">https://habr.com/ru/post/339960/</a></p>
