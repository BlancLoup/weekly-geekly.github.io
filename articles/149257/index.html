Why we decided to start your blog on Habr√©.</b> <br><br>  For additional PR?  Yes.  But there is another significant reason why they decided to open a blog on Habr√©. <br><br>  Almost every accountant knows about the products of BuhSoft, even if he didn‚Äôt buy the main products, he used free services at least once.  But in the IT-environment BuhSoft has always been little known. <br>  Well, that makes sense.  The success of the company, whose products are written on the dying Visual Fox Pro more often astonished, but not interesting.  The interest of IT-specialists, as a rule, went in the direction of 1C. <br>  However, development over 11 years has been stable.  When competitors recorded losses in crisis years, and we stopped hearing about some of them altogether, BuchSoft continued to gain growth.  By the way, many commercial ideas competitors copied from BuchSoft in those years. <br>  Conclusion: the language (environment) in which the product is developed is not the most important thing.  The client votes in money according to other criteria.

      Despite this conclusion, we did not plan to underestimate the new "cloud" trends.  In 2009, as an experiment, they offered our users a free online service for the preparation of certificates of income of individuals (report on form 2-NDFL). <br><br>  The service year convinced us that it will be in demand, and we started to develop a full-fledged accounting program, which is now called <a href="http://www.buhsoft.ru/%3Ftitle%3Donline/index.php">Buchsoft-Online</a> . <br><br>  And now in the IT-environment, we began to cause not only surprise, but also interest.  Increasingly, we get a lot of similar questions on the topic "well, how are you?"  Among our paid users there are mostly accountants, not a lot of technical specialists, but it is from techies that we get the bulk of criticism, suggestions, comments, resentment.  The accountant often defines the service as ‚Äúworking or not working‚Äù.  The developer will always exclaim with a glance from the side ‚Äúwell, who does that‚Äù. <br>  And we appreciate the criticism. <br><br>  That's why a blog about our successes and failures in the "cloud" accounting should be exactly on Habr√©! <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>2. Who is interested in Buhsoft Online</b> <br><br>  Immediately make a reservation that the product should be of interest to the user.  In our case, this is, first of all, bookkeeping.  It makes no sense to list what opportunities for an accountant provides Bukhsoft Online, it is easier to say that the service allows you to fully keep records in any tax regime. <br>  Fully - I mean from primary documents to send reports in electronic form.  In a single service in the hands of an accountant, trade accounting, warehouse, personnel records with automatic generation of personnel documents, payroll accounting with automatic generation of transactions and reports, asset accounting, etc., directly accounting and tax accounting in accordance with the requirements of the Tax Code. <br>  The enumeration of these opportunities is not at all the main subject of pride.  We do not understand how to offer a business a product that knows how to do something only partially.  Obviously, this is inconvenient for the user. <br>  Even customized import procedures from one program to another are like metro transfers.  It seems and is not difficult, but always pleased with the options under which it is necessary to get "in a straight line." <br>  Conclusion: the future for those programs that combine all business applications into a single desktop, with common directories and a common logic of information exchange. <br><br>  In developing the service, we focus on features that clearly demonstrate an advantage over offline software versions.  These advantages should have superior quality - convenience. <br>  For example, for an accountant, such things as the ability to sign and send electronic reports from any computer without installing cryptographic tools and other special programs are convenient.  It is convenient with one click to accept ready-made transactions from partners, that is, without the need to manually drive in the nomenclature of invoices and details of other documents, etc. <br>  In more detail about these and other useful opportunities we will state in the following posts. <br><br>  The second largest category of users of the product are Individual entrepreneurs in special tax regimes.  Basically, the service is acquired by those entrepreneurs who have a staff.  Those who do not have employees, as a rule, acquire only the ‚ÄúAccountancy‚Äù block - for maintaining a book of incomes and expenses, the ‚ÄúTrade and Services‚Äù block - if it carries out trading activities.  And sometimes they even think that they do not need anything.  In this regard, it is doubtful the profitability of those cloud services that are focused only on individual entrepreneurs.  The solvency of entrepreneurs is low, the number of ‚Äúdumps‚Äù is much higher than that of legal entities. <br><br>  The third category of users.  Leaders.  More precisely, in this case, the entire team of the organization, including the manager, uses Buhsoft Online.  You can work in the system without limiting the number of users and operations.  Each user can configure permissions to various services.  In real-time mode, the team works in a single trading, management, accounting and information system. <br>  The most in demand for the management team, and indeed for team interaction, is the ‚ÄúCorporate Task Scheduler‚Äù block.  You can set and transfer tasks not only to your employees, but also to your partners, automatically inviting them by e-mail to your collective management system. <br>  Each module Buchsoft Online provides a system of reminders that notify not only about the deadlines for submission of reports, but also about any little things that each user deems important for themselves. <br><br>  There is a fourth category - IT specialists.  It cannot be said that there are many of them as users.  But their interest in our online product is ten times higher than for offline.  Based on the issues and judgments that we face, including from fellow competitors, the impression is that the IT environment has formed several controversial illusions about the prospects for cloud services.  The main essence of illusions is that the "cloud" technology is so cool in itself that it is worth launching a product and thirsty users will tear it off with their hands. <br>  However, in 2012, the increase in sales of BuchSoft offline products is noticeably larger than from the online product.  This is despite the fact that the rate of registrations in the online service is very high - more than 50 thousand per year.  Statistics is real, not advertising.  Who is in the subject, he understands. <br>  We are interested in exploring users, their doubts when deciding in favor of online or offline, and in the near future we will share some results. <br><br>  <b>3. Meanwhile, the basis of sales is proven offline.</b> <br><br>  In general, the presence of both an offline product and a ‚Äúcloud‚Äù helps to make more balanced conclusions.  Frees from imaginary or desired statistics.  Probably, if we offered only a ‚Äúcloud‚Äù product on the market, it would be difficult to give an objective assessment of the fact that Russian business is not yet ready to fly in the clouds.  We see how our colleagues in the accounting forums diligently publicize the benefits of cloud services.  And silence is heard in response.  The dialogue is only between themselves.  To move the market, you need a lot more manpower and resources.  Probably, 1C forces are needed there? <br><br>  But 1C is a very interesting player.  From the point of view of technology, ‚Äúcloud solutions‚Äù have already been there for a long time.  It remains only to decide what to do with franchising, the efforts of which grew the empire.  No one needs to hurry.  The consumer does not yet require "online" in large quantities.  For individuals who are especially interested in prospects, a test entrance to the "clouds" is open.  Meanwhile, the basis of sales - proven offline next version.  The manufacturer is quite satisfied with the current situation.  After a massive transition to the "cloud", the role of a 1C specialist can be greatly reduced.  Therefore, a certain part of the IT environment does not need all this. <br><br>  But we all understand that there will be ‚Äúclouds‚Äù in accounting.  The only question is ‚Äúwhen‚Äù and who exactly will start mass promotion of them.  Let's wait.  It will be interesting. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/149257/">https://habr.com/ru/post/149257/</a></p>
