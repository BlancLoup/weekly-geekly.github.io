We will consider the possibility of using Big Data for the effective development of labor resources, and therefore, the most effective development of the organization as a whole.  And we begin with the trends emerging in the field of work with staff around the world today. <br><br> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/oracle/blog/271107/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b35/bd1/298/b35bd1298c254f43a4dac5c175d670b6.png"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  <font color="#ff0000">Trends</font> </h1><br>  What are these trends? <br><br>  First, the lack of talent - in the sense that companies do not always manage to find and properly use talent.  Secondly - the increasing amounts of data that can no longer be managed without timely analytics.  Thirdly, the transformation of social technologies.  A huge amount of information appears and settles on social networks, this information is often useful, and it affects the decision-making more and more.

      Finally, and very importantly, employees become internal clients for the HR department and require no less reverent attitude towards themselves than the attitude of the company towards its customers.  They expect to answer a variety of questions, from simple ones (when the salary comes, why the bonus is incorrectly calculated) to tricky ones (where is my development plan, when I will be promoted). <br><br>  An important issue is the transformation of labor.  Thousands of people cross the retirement age line every day; many of them are unique bearers of key knowledge and skills.  It is important to know in advance how many employees will leave the organization, and to have time to formalize their knowledge so that they remain in the company, as well as to prepare in time a reserve that will replace the outgoing ones. <br><br>  According to the annual survey of the heads of global companies conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers in 2014, 58% of the heads of companies are concerned about the lack of access to key skills.  For example, such skills are the ability to make high-quality (and not mediocre and simply bad) documents, deep (and not superficial, at the level of sales presentations) knowledge of the company's products and services, fluent (and not basic) knowledge of foreign languages.  Unfortunately, well-trained employees are often not taken into account in an organization ‚Äî even worse, an organization may be short-handed after another staff optimization, during which, as usual, sales will not be taken into account unique competencies.  It is not by chance that 77% of managers expect, over the course of the year, significant changes in how we will manage our talents and record information about our employees so that at the right moment this information will be at hand. <br><br>  Naturally, the methods of work are changing - because modern business requires new tools and technologies.  The report by the Corporate Executive Board "Breakthrough Performance in the New Work Environment, Executive Guide for 2013" noted that interaction increased by 67%, the amount of work with information increased by 76%, while 38% of employees give priority to simple and convenient sources of information . <br><br>  However, according to the data of the same Corporate Executive Board, less than 40% of employees using various technologies in their work note the real impact of these technologies on their productivity.  In the case of company executives and HR analysts, this indicator is approaching a critical one: more than 70% of the managers surveyed are convinced that it is the analyst who will help them make the most reasonable decisions regarding the use of staff, and less than 30% can boast that they get right moment of time relevant information.  Why? <br><br>  Because less than 40% of companies use analytics integrated into human resources management systems, the rest still prefer Excel.  Think about it: less than 40% of employers use in working with personnel who, as you know, solve everything, modern analytical platforms offering pre-configured KPI, ready-made and various reports, analytical forecasts and best HR-management practices.  Accordingly, more than 60% of organizations continue to manage HR inefficiently, causing both business and employees to suffer. <br><br><h1>  <font color="#ff0000">What to do?</font> </h1><br>  Of course, to introduce new HR technologies that provide easy and fast adaptation of new employees, offer users and businesses the flexibility and quick access to innovations, are inexpensive to use - and, of course, integrate with other IT systems of the enterprise. <br><br>  The main part of the functionality of the system suitable for you is a focus on talents.  The system should provide the search for the best candidates taking into account the social recommendations of employees and members of your community, comfortable involvement of line managers in the selection process, automatic screening (screening) of unsuitable candidates and quick adaptation of new employees.  It is very important to support training, which is unthinkable today without configurable training portals with pre-configured training plans, talent development management tools and career plans, which, among other things, make it possible to retain talents in the company. <br><br>  Talent retention is a separate issue.  Formal information from the personal files of employees is a bad helper, your HR system should offer a comprehensive analysis of talent potential, forecast and modeling the risk of employee loss, and means of setting career goals should be able to compare information about employees accumulated by the system with the descriptions of posts in staffing organization. <br><br>  We must not forget about the convenience of use.  Applications must be accessible from the cloud and work on modern mobile devices, while offering a single, user-friendly interface on all devices and platforms.  And, since we are talking about people, the system should link employees into an integrated social network that will allow them to work in groups, learn, achieve results and receive feedback from colleagues. <br><br><h1>  <font color="#ff0000">Who will help?</font> </h1><br>  Oracle's HR analytics solution offers best talent management practices.  This is an analytical platform with hundreds of pre-configured KPIs, which reflects a personnel picture of your enterprise in real-time, reporting without limitations, analytical forecasts with the ability to build what-if models and best practices of HR management based on big data. <br><br>  Among the main functions of the Oracle analytical solution for HR: <br><ul><li>  obtaining an up-to-date summary of the composition of personnel and personnel costs for all departments; </li><li>  preparation of comprehensive reports on personnel processes, such as, for example, a report on the impact of staff turnover on the performance of individual units; </li><li>  the ability to identify key factors for the effective use of staff (demand for training resources, the effectiveness of hiring procedures, etc.); </li><li>  proactive analytics (forecast of the consequences of raising an employee, forecast of employee dismissal, analysis of projected performance and dismissal indicators, etc.); </li><li>  user comfort tools, such as custom pre-configured panels, etc. </li></ul><br>  All this analytics is based on the consolidation and optimization of all data on the organization‚Äôs personnel, and it would be impossible without the use of big data technology.  Big data analytics provide a complete overview of the use of human resources at all levels of an organization. <br><ul><li>  At <b>the staff level,</b> Oracle HR analytics allows you to build optimal job profiles, predict the personal effectiveness of each team member, find ways to best motivate each employee, take adequate measures to retain an employee in the company, ensure optimal career development for an employee, predict and prevent dismissal, prepare in advance change, identify the employee‚Äôs internal corporate social circle and the consequences of internal corporate communication, preventing conflicts and encouraging  the formation of groups that can be the basis of effective project teams. <br>  At <b>the subdivision level, the</b> analyst allows you to diagnose a personnel situation, identify risks of reduced productivity, absenteeism and dismissal of employees, and determine the best internal and external sources of personnel. <br>  At the <b>organization‚Äôs workflow level, the</b> Oracle solution allows you to determine the optimal number of personnel servicing each process and identify the employees who provide the greatest and lowest efficiency. <br><br>  Thus, the Oracle solution allows you to plan further investments in personnel development, retain the most valuable employees of the company, use the best world practice of personnel planning, simplify the work of the personnel service (improve the closing time of a vacancy, the ‚Äúmanagers / employees‚Äù indicator, etc.), identify bottlenecks in personnel procedures and find more suitable solutions, respond quickly to emerging challenges. <br><br><h1>  <font color="#ff0000">Where does it work?</font> </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/411/660/63c/41166063ce36474e9951cca7c4ef3433.png" align="left">  One of Oracle's clients in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãHR-analytics is the large Swiss bank UBS.  The bank needed a personnel management solution that could work at a global level and could help transform HR processes.  The implementation of Oracle HCM has made it possible to increase the efficiency of personnel assessment processes, the planning of employees' goals and objectives, the measurement of their performance, as well as personnel adaptation processes. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4cc/d80/df7/4ccd80df7fdb4a23bf70fea92e768fd8.png" align="left">  Eaton is an international energy company with a total staff of 103 thousand people ‚Äî based on the results of the implementation of HR analytics, Oracle was able to create analytical reports on the company's entire personnel management, including a summary analysis of the use of labor resources within the organization, transparent information on performance indicators, turnover and staff retention, as well as analytics in the recruitment, training and remuneration of employees.  There was a general increase in labor productivity. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5c1/aea/47e/5c1aea47e73f4e588e46ff90ca40b1a1.png" align="left">  The UK Department of Health, which is the sixth largest employer in the world with a total staff of 1.4 million, also introduced Oracle HR analytics to predict turnover and employee retention.  As a result, the ministry received a convenient strategic analysis tool for all areas of personnel management for 1.4 million employees, access to accurate and timely information to make informed decisions about all hospital and outpatient services staff and a number of tools for users, such as dashboards, preconfigured and custom reports. <br><br>  Users of the Oracle HCM solution are hundreds of global companies and dozens of companies in Russia and the CIS.  For all these companies, the use of big data in HR has helped to increase the speed and quality of personnel decision making and increase work efficiency in many areas of personnel management: in recruiting, in managing employee performance, in career planning, in reward systems.  After all, measurement and prediction in the field of talent management is the main thing that allows HR managers to create (and prove!) Business value. </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/271107/">https://habr.com/ru/post/271107/</a></p>
