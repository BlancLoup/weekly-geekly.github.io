But as it was recently <a href="https://twitter.com/">noticed</a> on Twitter, it was from him that I started my activity on Habr√© - the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/gadgets/41152/">post</a> about the first version of the ‚Äúunkillable‚Äù flash drive was really the debut one.  And if the first pancake was more like a com, today in the article we will focus on the second release of the flash drive - in December 2013 it will celebrate the anniversary of the end of the world with surviving unicellular organisms) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c30/e90/e6e/c30e90e6e6291ac84d856e85cd90fbca.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      For a long time I used the first version of the product - a stainless steel container, which appears on the video from my first post.  For all the time, it has practically not changed - it has not faded, it has not been covered with a web of scratches and not ‚Äúitd‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/135/5f7/284/1355f7284db1d502152b8e604bc2eb80.jpg"><br><br>  Is that the shemka itself there was inserted another - in the crash test was used drive small capacity, which was not sorry to kill. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/476/60f/6f9/47660f6f90442b1044594fc2f04906ea.jpg"><br><br>  But time passes, everything changes - technology as well.  There was little volume, there was little USB 2.0 - in general, I wanted a change.  I will not beat around the bush - lately I used a 64 GB Kingmax flash drive as the main removable media device - a big dule with USB 3.0 interface support.  The review of such trifles on Habr√© will be laughed today, so I shared my impressions on the device in instagram (there is the same nickname as everywhere else): <a href="http://instagr.am/p/NN-_Q/">1</a> and <a href="http://instagr.am/p/NOADS/">2</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/01e/2e7/1a5/01e2e71a57e11533ee8ab17d7c9b725a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/662/208/34f/66220834f4d127e7182b1a7303db844f.jpg"><br><br>  I decided to use this drive as a donor for the new ‚Äúarmored car‚Äù.  Moreover, the original building has already kept on an honest word and almost did not have to make efforts to disassemble it: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6c6/132/036/6c6132036e633ae627ad5f082c2bdf4a.jpg"><br><br>  After careful measurements of the drive board, a drawing of the necessary container was made.  At this time, he restored minimalism: without a hole for fastening on a string / chain (the dimensions are large without it), without cutting and other buns.  Just a neat container such a cylinder, without any decor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e62/51d/a25/e6251da250b899a4fcfb614c88fde3ae.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/878/114/cab/878114cab4d6b8e6906a9c696df3f1f1.jpg"><br><br>  Stainless steel?  Not this time.  As a material, it was decided to use titanium - a metal, the unique properties of which need no introduction.  Does not tarnish and does not rust, very light and durable - to scratch it, you need to try hard.  It is processed, perhaps, extremely badly - especially when it comes to threading. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ea2/afa/cdf/ea2afacdff052bd1e48b3a0d10f0f782.jpg"><br><br>  Here, for example, my ring, which is less often flashing in reviews, is also carved out of titanium - for several years about 200 bottles of beer (to friends) were discovered.  On the outside (on the edges), the ‚ÄúBoomburum‚Äù is manually engraved, and on the inside, as you see, there is not a single scratch.  Amazing stuff! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ec4/4f3/e31/ec44f3e31df954dcbfba64dc79ee13b6.jpg"><br><br>  It is clear that a container with the required size will not appear from the air - here again a man with golden hands helped: my dad, a turner of the 80th level.  Thanks to him a lot - from the first time it came out exactly the way I wanted.  It remains, perhaps, to wipe the product with a cotton swab from the inside - there remained titanium dust. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/550/f52/1d9/550f521d975a244467bff55b531d6f29.jpg"><br><br>  The first fitting - everything is ok. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8f2/29a/bd5/8f229abd587d8b920d9b8ef5d08a5f3e.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Fooled by demons </h2><br>  It remains to secure the drive itself inside the container.  Despite the fact that the microcircuit itself was kept quite tightly in the container, we didn‚Äôt want to leave it on the ‚Äúhonest word‚Äù.  There are many mounting options, but only a couple of suitable ones: epoxy <s>clay</s> , sealants, wax and liquid polyethylene. <br><br>  Epoxy has proved itself well for a long time, many people advised it to me, but I didn‚Äôt want to mess with it.  I doubly did not want to mess with the plasticizer, without which the epoxy would become fragile over time.  Given the fact that there was neither one nor the other - I have postponed this option. <br><br>  All kinds of sealants a whole car, but did not want to get involved with them for two reasons: why buy a tube of sealant for my nano-needs?  And second, they now have such acid-base compositions that the flash drive would die, as they say, from the inside.  Read the compositions, study?  Well, they nafig. <br><br>  Wax could be poured into a container and literally dip the flash drive there - it would turn out monolithic, cheap and angry.  In addition, it is also reusable - if necessary, the chip could be reached after heating in hot water.  But as I presented these candles, this greasy feeling on my hands ... brr.  Not. <br><br>  Liquid polyethylene from the so-called thermogun remained - this is the option I used the last time.  There are a lot of advantages, but I will only mention the disadvantages of this option: first, it is used to glue something, so that the flash drive will sit inside, if not forever, then for a long time - you can most likely pull it out by drilling;  on the other hand, it is even a plus, if the goal is to make something really durable.  But the second point is much more dangerous: the melting point of this chemistry can reach up to 200 degrees, which is enough to, if not kill the memory chips, then at least melt the solder. <br><br>  But doubts disappeared when I read the instructions for the thermogun: the temperature of the melted ‚Äúglue‚Äù is about 130-150 degrees.  And as it turned out, it does not use exactly ‚Äúpolyethylene‚Äù - this material is called <abbr title="Ethylene Vinyl Acetate">EVA</abbr> (EVA, Ethylene Vinyl Acetate - a copolymer of ethylene and vinyl acetate).  Googling, I was even glad about this: in addition to the ‚Äúsafe‚Äù temperature, this material exceeds its ‚Äúbrother‚Äù in many ways.  So, for example, it is more transparent and elastic at low temperatures, it has increased adhesion to various materials, and + to this, it has excellent cushioning properties.  In addition, he has a very low density - only 0.931 g / cm? .. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b43/396/941/b43396941d48ba736f3d343f64ededdb.jpg"><br><br>  In general, the alignment is as follows: a newspaper, a thermogun, a socket.  Three minutes later, a signal arrived that everything was ready: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0e8/e5c/33a/0e8e5c33ae9bb834d8aa41304a5d4cab.jpg"><br><br>  Let me remind you that the last time I improperly ‚Äúwalled up‚Äù the flash drive inside the container, as a result of which she died during the tests (the microcircuit broke off from the high overload) - this time I tried to foresee this moment.  For this taped all the main points;  they did not cover the chips themselves - out of harm's way.  Everything superfluous and protruding was removed with a stationery knife. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b25/202/b35/b25202b353766a2d23f6b141c2e7731b.jpg"><br><br>  When everything was ready, I inserted the microcircuit into the <s>processor's</s> system unit - the friendly LED blinked, <s>autorun immediately launched the free.exe</s> drive determined in the system.  Cheers, final straight. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b09/648/d99/b09648d9960f24f4e227fc8fdb225c33.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, about the LED - in my case, he was as far as possible and had to forget about him.  Although in the previous case it was brighter and closer to the connector, this was enough to create a pleasant glow (seen on the <a href="http://youtu.be/UL0YnjAkH10%3Ft%3D2m43s">crash test</a> video). <br><br>  After inserting the ‚Äúflooded‚Äù USB flash drive into the container, I filled everything with this thing from a pistol.  After five minutes, it remains to make the final touch - to remove the plastic snot that has drained as a result of careless sealing of the drive.  As it was written above, they are cleaned with a stationery knife. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1e8/48b/9ac/1e848b9ac9432be5465bfdaaf0c839a8.jpg"><br><br>  Again, this was not very neat, but this is only noticeable if you carefully peer into the connector area.  Do you often look there?  Here I am not. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/304/bc0/d79/304bc0d7996d0f6098e2fe10fef2c621.jpg"><br><br>  Unfortunately, even a similar case will not save the flash drive from all disasters.  For example, the previous flash drive ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/105033/">Verbatim 32 GB</a> with eSATA interface) peacefully stuck out of the USB port of the media center, when suddenly a heavy wooden statue of a cat fell on it from a meter height (from a shelf), into which a child accidentally hit a ball.  The result - the drive connector was torn out with a piece of chip.  So this karma. <br><br><h2>  Happy end </h2><br>  Despite its large size, the device turned out very light.  There was no scale at hand, so here is a photo for those who do not believe (and <a href="">this one is</a> for those who do not believe that the photo is complete with an internal body): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0ed/f67/d10/0edf67d108ab3f0b5252bf6f72600900.jpg"><br><br>  Anyway, I'm not worried about the USB ports of my devices.  Unless, not everywhere such fool will get - for example, in a port under an Apple-clave by all means. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d77/e54/81f/d77e5481fb21956d6d776868be1d10ad.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/621/b0d/0b6/621b0d0b64ed0b74f68b378116ac5ba3.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2cf/193/4c7/2cf1934c77eed17990c6242e8d0bbddc.jpg"><br><br>  The flash drive worked fine, but, as expected, the light from the depths of the LED practically does not reach the surface.  In general, I am more than satisfied with the result, I will not conduct a crash test :) But I would very much like constructive criticism. <br><br>  Unfortunately, with the mass production of such pieces so far nothing has happened. <br><br>  Posts on the topic: <br>  - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/gadgets/41152/">Unkillable flash drive.</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/gadgets/41152/">Homemade!</a> <br>  - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DnPPpWz66TUo">HTC HD2 crash test</a> <br>  - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/112608/">Desten notebook crash test</a> <br><br>  Good luck, take care of the bytes! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/135788/">https://habr.com/ru/post/135788/</a></p>
