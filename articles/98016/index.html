      I had to give it up. <br>  There are several reasons, we are tired of looking for a normal Windows client that could fit the chat invitation window on the screen, but so that the consultant can click on the button. <br><br>  It is difficult to explain it is necessary to try, there is a kilometer text of the invitation to chat, without hyphenation. <br><br>  It was difficult to connect several consultants to the site, it‚Äôs certainly not possible, but it‚Äôs not intended for that, let's say. <br><br>  We are not very pleased when our customers (we have our own online stores) write at the entrance that they communicate with someone unknown and let them be careful, in short, they carefully closed the chat and left (not all of course). <br><br>  Then one day this thing stopped working, namely, it demanded registration from visitors, in short, it had to be abandoned altogether. <br><br>  As usual, the long search for alternatives, we probably went through all that was, and our bike in the end. <br>  But once I decided to do it, we decided to go all the way and make ready service. <br>  Yes, it is paid but it is also free. <br><br>  Indeed, there are many similar systems, but there the consultant mainly receives messages from the visitor via the website or the client‚Äôs self-written program. <br><br>  In those rare cases where communication occurs through jabber, there is some (in our opinion significant) difference in work. <br>  There, a bot is added to your jabber account on behalf of which you will receive messages, the history, respectively, is all in one handful, which is simply not realistic to understand. <br><br>  In our case, you receive messages not from the bot, but from the JID generated by us (Jabber ID) under which of course a real person, by the way, we generate a funny JID, but thank God only the consultant sees it. <br>  Accordingly, the entire correspondence history is saved separately for each visitor, and not for one bot. <br><br>  <b>We have a number of principles for which we can already not love:</b> <br>  Total ban on actions not initiated by the visitor. <br>  Yes, we do not allow to call the visitor and do not follow him while he walks through the pages. <br>  Of course, at the time of calling a consultant, we report from which page it was called and where it comes from geographically, this is the necessary information and it is very important for the consultant. <br>  But no more than that. <br><br>  We do not show the missing consultants, we are sure that this is not correct, we don‚Äôt like it by going to any site, to see that there was a consultant there, at one time. <br><br>  As soon as the consultant changes the status to unavailable, the system will choose another free one, or just hide the call button without reloading the page. <br>  Obviously, you can change the status automatically, almost any jabber client can do this by no activity timeout. <br><br>  We have the opportunity to redirect the visitor to the page indicated by the consultant, but we strongly recommend not to do this, because not all visitors calmly perceive when the operator begins to explicitly control their browser. <br><br>  We do not require registration at the entrance to the chat, this is purely voluntary action. <br>  But if the visitor introduces himself, we will inform the consultant about this, and the visitor will have the opportunity to send a dialogue by email. <br><br>  <b>Further a few advantages:</b> <br><br>  The number of visitors is unlimited. <br>  Without our logo and links in the chat window. <br>  Available all system functionality at once. <br>  It is possible to switch to another operator. <br>  Sound notification (while always on) when a message arrives at the visitor's chat, but not for each message, if messages from the consultant go in a row, then there will be only one. <br><br>  I am sure that I missed a lot. <br>  I will add as required. <br><br>  It turned out that we now need to show the number of consultants and online dialogues, but they certainly already exist, but there are not so many of them yet and this is not constant and not stable to show this, because we want to connect a certain number of operators / sites, but condition that you will be some kind of constant flow of communication with customers. <br><br>  Thus, we will have very active dynamic statistics, without lies and artificial cheating. <br><br>  Please write in lichku if you want to connect. <br>  I can not promise that we will connect everyone. <br><br>  We are sure that you can find a lot of things, and there are mistakes, and we are not perfect. <br>  Please write in a personal about it. <br><br>  Thank. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/98016/">https://habr.com/ru/post/98016/</a></p>
