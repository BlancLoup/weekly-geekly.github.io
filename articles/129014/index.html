But what kind of kitchen Lingvo without a complaint base, because it is here that the hottest discussions about how to make a Lingvo dictionary take place! <a name="habracut"></a>

Sushi in Russian </h4><br>  <b>Lexicographer Trainee (Japanese):</b> <br>  The word sushi translates into Russian as sushi.  And Carthage must be destroyed. <br><br>  <b>Lexicograph 1:</b> <br>  Russian spelling dictionaries already give ‚Äúsushi, sushi‚Äù.  Yes, the phonetic transmission rules are violated.  But what can you do - usus! <br><br>  As is known, the process of borrowing foreign lexemes can be: a) direct (directly from the source language), b) indirect (through some other language).  The word "sushi" we, nevertheless, borrowed not directly from the Japanese language (then, undoubtedly, it would be "sushi"), but from English.  Hence ‚Äúsushi‚Äù (from the English form sushi, according to the rules of phonetic transcription). <br><br>  What we cannot but agree with is the fact that it is not only the ‚Äúsushi‚Äù option that is given as a translation, but also ‚Äúsushi‚Äù too. <br>  Severity changed: Critical bug -&gt; Suggestion <br><br>  <b>Lexicograph 2:</b> <br>  ‚ÄúSushi‚Äù are added. <br>  Status changed: Actual -&gt; Fixed <br><br>  <b>Lexicograph trainee:</b> <br>  The word was borrowed from Japanese (open any publication before 1991) and then re-borrowed again through English.  Usus is a use of words, but I would put sushi in the first place, and barbarism in the second place with an explanation that this is a secondary borrowing. <br>  Status changed: Fixed -&gt; Verified <br><br>  <b>Lexicograph 1:</b> <br>  We do not give comments on ‚Äúprimary / secondary borrowing‚Äù in our dictionary.  If we give in one particular case, then it will look, at least, strange.  Systematically, it‚Äôs unrealistic to affix the entire dictionary - there is no time. <br>  Translation equivalents are not available in terms of etymology, but in frequency.  In terms of frequency, ‚Äúsushi‚Äù is noticeably ahead. <br><br>  Regarding secondary borrowing: secondary borrowing usually takes place when the primary one ‚Äúdid not stick down‚Äù, was forgotten or continued to be sluggish as local exotism.  And in the case of secondary mediated borrowing, we cannot prohibit the intermediate language to influence the form of the word borrowed through it. <br><br>  <b>Lexicograph 2:</b> <br>  In the Russian language, ‚Äúsushi‚Äù got accustomed (8 million on Yandex, against 202 thousand ‚Äúsushi‚Äù).  Until 1991, Russia simply did not have the reality itself and it didn‚Äôt matter what they were called. <br><br>  <b>Lexicograph 1:</b> <br>  Agree.  In fact, ‚Äúsushi‚Äù appeared in the language as exotic, non-equivalent vocabulary.  ‚ÄúSushi‚Äù is already a designation of a reality that came to us not directly from Japan, after all. <br><br>  <b>Lexicograph trainee:</b> <br>  Until 1991, the reality was not, and specials.  and thin  liter about Japan was.  Sushi is really more, but there is a growing movement for sushi, and part of the institutions of japanis-style public catering is written in the sushi menu.  Deciding which spelling to put in the first place, we designate which side we are on and (more importantly) give one side or the other a powerful argument in holy war. <br>  Status changed: Verified -&gt; Actual <br><br>  <b>Lexicograph 1:</b> <br>  Colleagues, we do not have time for a long time to mark time.  We give both options, placing them in frequency.  This is our common principle, which we have been trying to implement in recent articles in our articles.  And breaking the spears is not worth it.  There are data of explanatory dictionaries of the Russian language, there is data from search engines and shells.  We have no right to ignore this data for the sake of our concepts, imitating those researchers for whom there are no wrong concepts, but there are wrong facts. <br><br>  <b>Lexicograph 2:</b> <br>  I understand and share the professional accuracy of the Japanese, but let's leave, as the Russian language decided, otherwise we will soon start reading and installing Hamlet. <br>  Status changed: Actual -&gt; Fixed <br><br>  PS Now the sushi article in Lingvo looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/66f/15b/c68/66f15bc68813ee573a0f0acac57ea3a5.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The original of this post was posted <a href="http://lingvo-ru.livejournal.com/">on the ABBYY Lingvo team blog</a> . <br><br>  <i>Natalia Frolova,</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Department of Linguistic Products</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/129014/">https://habr.com/ru/post/129014/</a></p>
