Within 40 minutes, the request was not answered.  We called there, explained the situation ... The person on the other end of the line, said that now they would look and unsubscribe.  As a result, after 1 hour and 10 minutes, the answer comes that the hard drive failed on the server and that it will be replaced within 10 minutes.  Here they really did everything in 10 minutes.  and the server began to work normally.  Total downtime 2 hours. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Today, at 3:00 pm, instead of our projects, error 502 flaunted. When I tried to log in via SSH, the server did not allow, I wrote that the password was entered incorrectly.  We sent a request to the technical support.  An hour passed, there was no answer - they called them, explained the situation, and received an answer ‚ÄúOur engineer went to the data center, he will look at the problem and we will write to you ...‚Äù After that, we call every 2 hours there and every time we hear in response ‚Äúthey are engaged in the server, we will unsubscribe you‚Äù. Already 21:57, the server is 7 hours and there is still no normal answer, only the phrase ‚Äúthey are engaged in the server, we will unsubscribe you‚Äù. <br><br>  Habralyudi, tell me what to do in this situation? <br><br>  By the way, this is not all.  About a month ago, when we just ordered a server, there was a situation when the server did not get up after a reboot.  This happened because of the automatic kernel update and the incompatibility of some pieces of hardware with the Linux version (here I can‚Äôt say for sure, but our administrator said something like this to me).  We also sent a request to those.  support so that they restart the server with a different kernel.  To which we received the answer - the person who is engaged in this, to appear only at 9 am (and the time was 2 nights).  Then we decided to ask for KVM to restart the server with a different kernel, and received the answer "we will try, but we do not promise that we will be able to provide KVM".  We all went to bed.  We woke up at 11 am - the server was still lying and the KVM was never provided ... They called them there, explained the situation 10th time - the guy on the other end of the line almost swore that they would do everything now.  An hour passed - everything is quiet, we called them once again - the guy handed the phone to another employee, who said that she is now looking through KVM our server and that he does not understand how to reboot it with another kernel.  In short, another 40 minutes was all this nonsense, in the end, they gave us all the same KVM and in 1 minute we restarted the server with a different core and the server went up. <br><br>  In general, a very bad opinion has developed about the work of supporting eServer, and from all cases it has become clear that there are students who have no experience working with servers and clients. <br><br>  By the way, I tried to call the directorate‚Äôs phone - I got into those again.  support, which dissolving snot, begged to wait a little bit more. <br><br>  PS Sorry if the text contains spelling or grammatical errors - just the head does not think because of all this, but I really want to share and ask for advice. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/15435/">https://habr.com/ru/post/15435/</a></p>
