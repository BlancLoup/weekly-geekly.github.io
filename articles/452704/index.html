It seems nothing complicated, the box, which must sometimes come out of sleep mode, report to the server and fall asleep back. </p><br><p>  Practice quickly showed that the debugger does not help much when working with a microcontroller, which constantly goes into deep sleep mode or cuts down on food.  Basically, because the box was in test mode without a debugger and without me, and <em>sometimes</em> buggy.  About once every few days. </p><br><p>  On the snot, the debug UART was bolted into which I began to log.  It became easier, some problems were solved.  But then there was an assert and everything turned out. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">In my case, the assertion macro looks something like this:</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><pre><code class="cpp hljs"><span class="hljs-meta"><span class="hljs-meta">#</span><span class="hljs-meta-keyword"><span class="hljs-meta"><span class="hljs-meta-keyword">define</span></span></span><span class="hljs-meta"> USER_ASSERT( statement ) \ do \ { \ </span><span class="hljs-meta-keyword"><span class="hljs-meta"><span class="hljs-meta-keyword">if</span></span></span><span class="hljs-meta">(! (statement) ) \ { \ DEBUG_PRINTF_ERROR( </span><span class="hljs-meta-string"><span class="hljs-meta"><span class="hljs-meta-string">"Assertion on line %d in file %s!\n"</span></span></span><span class="hljs-meta">, \ __LINE__, __FILE__ ); \ \ __disable_irq(); \ while(1) \ { \ __BKPT(0xAB); \ </span><span class="hljs-meta-keyword"><span class="hljs-meta"><span class="hljs-meta-keyword">if</span></span></span><span class="hljs-meta">(0) \ break; \ } \ } \ } while(0)</span></span></code> </pre> <br><p>  <code>__BKPT(0xAB)</code> is a software breakpoint;  if an assert occurs under debugging, then the debugger simply stops at the problem line, which is very convenient. </p></div></div><br><p>  For some asserts, it is immediately clear what caused them - because in the log you can see the file name and the line number on which the assertion worked. </p><br><p>  But according to the assertion that was happening, it was only clear that the array was overflowed - more precisely, a self-made wrapper over the array, which checks for overflow.  Because of this, only the file name ‚Äúsuper_array.h‚Äù and the line number in it were visible in the log.  And which particular array is not clear.  From the surrounding logs is also unclear. </p><br><p>  Of course, it would be possible to just bite the bullet and go read my code, but I was too lazy, and then the article would not have turned out. </p><br><p>  As I write in uVision Keil 5 with the armcc compiler, further code is checked only under it.  I also used C ++ 11, because it is already 2019 in the yard, it's time already. </p><br><h2 id="stacktrace">  Stacktrace </h2><br><p>  Of course, the first thing that comes to mind is but a pancake, because when an assert occurs on a normal desktop computer, a glass trace is output to the console, such as on the KDPV.  It is usually possible to understand from the sequence that the sequence of calls led to the error. <br>  Okay, so I need a glass frame too.  How to make it? </p><br><h3 id="mozhet-byt-esli-brosit-isklyuchenie-on-sam-vyvedetsya">  Maybe if you throw an exception, he will be displayed? </h3><br><p>  We throw an exception and do not catch it, we see the output of ‚ÄúSIGABRT‚Äù and the call to <code>_sys_exit</code> .  Not a ride, well, okay, not very much and wanted to allow exceptions. </p><br><h3 id="poguglit-kak-eto-drugie-lyudi-delayut">  Googling how other people do it. </h3><br><p>  All methods are platform <code>execinfo.h</code> (not too surprising), for gcc under POSIX there is <code>backtrace()</code> and <code>execinfo.h</code> .  There was nothing intelligible for Kayla.  We're dropping a mean tear.  We'll have to get into the stack with our hands. </p><br><h3 id="lezem-v-stek-rukami">  We climb into the stack with his hands </h3><br><p>  Theoretically, it's pretty simple. </p><br><ol><li>  The return address of the current function is in the LR register, the address of the current top of the stack (in the sense of the last element in the stack) is in the SP register, the address of the current command is in the RS register. </li><li>  Somehow we find the size of the stack frame for the current function, step along the stack for such a distance, find the return address for the previous function there and repeat it until we go through the stack to the end. </li><li>  Somehow we associate return addresses with line numbers in source code files. </li></ol><br><h4 id="okey-dlya-nachala--kak-uznat-razmer-stekovogo-kadra">  Okay, for starters - how to know the size of the stack frame? </h4><br><p>  On the default options - apparently, by no means, it is simply hardcoded by the compiler in the ‚Äúprologue‚Äù and ‚Äúepilogue‚Äù of each function, into commands that allocate and free a piece of stack under the frame. <br>  But, fortunately, armcc has an option - <code>--use_frame_pointer</code> , which allocates the R11 register under the Frame Pointer - i.e.  pointer to stack frame of the previous function.  Ok, now you can go through all the stack frames. </p><br><h4 id="teper--kak-sopostavit-adresa-vozvratov-so-strokami-v-faylah-s-ishodnikami">  Now - how to match return addresses with lines in source files? </h4><br><p>  Damn, again nothing.  The debug information in the microcontroller is not flashed (which is not surprising, since it takes up decent space).  Is it possible for Kale to still force her to go in there, I don‚Äôt know, I couldn‚Äôt find it. </p><br><p>  Sigh.  This means that an honest structure - such that the names of functions and line numbers are immediately output to the debug output - does not work.  But you can display the addresses, and then compare them with functions and line numbers on the computer, since there is a debug info in the project. </p><br><p>  But it looks very sad, because you have to parse the .map file, which shows the ranges of addresses that each function takes.  And then separately parse the files with the disassembled code to find a specific line.  There is a sharp desire to score. </p><br><p>  Plus, a careful look at the documentation on the <code>--use_frame_pointer</code> option allows <code>--use_frame_pointer</code> to see <a href="http://www.keil.com/support/docs/4133.htm">this page</a> , which says that this option can lead to a HardFault crash at random times.  Hmm. <br>  Well, we think further. </p><br><h3 id="a-kak-eto-delaet-otladchik">  How does the debugger do this? </h3><br><p>  But the debugger somehow shows the call stack, even without a <code>frame pointer'a</code> .  Well, it‚Äôs clear how, the IDE has all the debug info at hand, it‚Äôs not difficult to compare addresses and function names.  Hm </p><br><p>  At the same time, the same Visual Studio has such a thing - minidump - when a falling application generates a small file, which you then feed the studio and it restores the state of the application at the time of the fall.  And you can consider all the variables, take a walk along the stack with comfort.  Hmm again. </p><br><p>  But it seems to be quite simple.  Need only <del>  Every day, rub in the buttocks thick Soviet continuation of the link </del>  fill the stack with the values ‚Äã‚Äãthat were there at the moment of the fall and, apparently, restore the state of the registers.  And everything seems to be? </p><br><p>  Again, we divide this idea into subtasks. </p><br><ol><li>  On the microcontroller you need to go through the stack, for this you need to get the current value of SP and the address of the beginning of the stack. </li><li>  On the microcontroller you need to display the values ‚Äã‚Äãof the registers. </li><li>  In the IDE, you need to somehow push all the values ‚Äã‚Äãfrom the minidump back onto the stack.  And register values ‚Äã‚Äãtoo. </li></ol><br><h4 id="kak-poluchit-tekuschee-znachenie-sp">  How to get the current SP value? </h4><br><p>  It is advisable not maraya hands on the assembler.  Fortunately, <code>__current_sp()</code> has a special function (intrinsic) - <code>__current_sp()</code> .  The gcc won't work, but I don't need it. </p><br><p>  How to get the address of the beginning of the stack?  Since I use my script to protect against overflow (about which I wrote <a href="https://habr.com/en/post/425071/">here</a> ), I have a stack in a separate linker section, which I called <code>REGION_STACK</code> . <br>  This means that the address of the beginning can be obtained from the linker, with the help of <a href="http://www.keil.com/support/man/docs/armlink/armlink_pge1362065953229.htm">strange variables with dollars in the names</a> . </p><br><p>  Using trial and error, select the desired name - <code>Image$$REGION_STACK$$ZI$$Limit</code> , check, work. </p><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Explanation</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><p>  This is a magic symbol that is created at the linking stage; therefore, strictly speaking, it is not a constant of the compilation stage. <br>  To use it, you need dereferencing: </p><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">extern</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">unsigned</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">int</span></span> Image$$REGION_STACK$$ZI$$Limit; <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">using</span></span> MemPointer = <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">uint32_t</span></span> *; <span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">//   ,   static const auto stack_upper_address = (MemPointer) &amp;( Image$$REGION_STACK$$ZI$$Limit );</span></span></code> </pre> </div></div><br><p>  If you don‚Äôt want to bother like that, then the stack size can simply be hard-coded, since it changes quite rarely.  In the worst case, we will see in the call stack window not all calls, but a stub. </p><br><h4 id="kak-vyvesti-znacheniya-registrov">  How to display register values? </h4><br><p>  At first I thought that it was necessary to derive all the general-purpose registers in general, I began to stir up mutki with an assembler, but I quickly realized that there would be no sense from this.  After all, the minidump output will have a special function for me, there is no sense from the values ‚Äã‚Äãof the registers in its context. </p><br><p>  Only Link Register (LR), which stores the return address from the current function, the SP with which we already figured out, and the Program Counter (PC), which stores the address of the current command, are really needed. </p><br><p>  Again, I could not find an option that would work with any compiler, but again Kayla has intrinsic functions: <code>__return_address()</code> for LR and <code>__current_pc()</code> for MS. <br>  Fine.  It remains to push all the values ‚Äã‚Äãfrom the minidump back onto the stack, and the register values ‚Äã‚Äãinto registers. </p><br><h4 id="kak-zagruzit-minidamp-v-pamyat">  How to load minidump into memory? </h4><br><p>  First, I planned to use the LOAD debugger command, which allows you to load values ‚Äã‚Äãfrom a .hex or .bin file into memory, but quickly found out that LOAD for some reason does not load values ‚Äã‚Äãinto RAM. <br>  And I would not be able to fill out the registers with this command anyway. </p><br><p>  Well, okay, it would still require too many gestures, convert text to bin, convert bin to hex ... </p><br><p>  Fortunately, Kayla has a simulator, and for a simulator you can write scripts in some wretched C-like language.  And in this language there is an opportunity to write in memory!  To do this, there are special functions like <code>_WDWORD</code> and <code>_WBYTE</code> .  We collect all ideas in a heap, and we receive here such code. </p><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">All code:</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><pre> <code class="cpp hljs"><span class="hljs-meta"><span class="hljs-meta">#</span><span class="hljs-meta-keyword"><span class="hljs-meta"><span class="hljs-meta-keyword">define</span></span></span><span class="hljs-meta"> USER_ASSERT( statement ) \ do \ { \ </span><span class="hljs-meta-keyword"><span class="hljs-meta"><span class="hljs-meta-keyword">if</span></span></span><span class="hljs-meta">(!

And in the Callstack + Locals window you can see the call stack. </p><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Note:</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><p>  The function is specifically named with two underscores at the beginning, because if the name of the function or variable in the simulation script coincides with the name in the project code, then Keil will not be able to call it.  Standard C ++ prohibits the use of names with two underscores in the beginning, so the likelihood of matching names is reduced. </p></div></div><br><p>  Basically, that's all.  As far as I could verify, the minidump works for both normal functions and interrupt handlers.  Whether it will work for any perversions with <code>setjmp/longjmp</code> or <code>alloca</code> - I don‚Äôt know, because I don‚Äôt practice perversions. </p><br><p>  I am quite pleased with what happened;  The code is small, from the overhead - the macro for the assert is slightly swollen.  In this case, all the boring work on the analysis of the stack fell on the shoulders of the IDE, where it belongs. </p><br><p>  Then I googled a bit more and found a similar thing for gcc and gdb - <a href="https://github.com/adamgreen/CrashCatcher">CrashCatcher</a> . </p><br><p>  I understand that I have not invented anything new, but I did not manage to find a ready-made recipe leading to a similar result.  I would be grateful if they tell me what could have been done better. </p></div>
