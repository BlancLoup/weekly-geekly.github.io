But this time we simultaneously conducted the Moscow <b>Mobius</b> and opened the registration to Petersburg (to be held May 22-23).  And we decided that the story ‚Äúwhat was in Moscow‚Äù will help everyone at once: someone thanks him will relive the Moscow event, and someone will decide whether to buy tickets for St. Petersburg, while they are the cheapest. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Program </h2><br>  When there are dozens of reports at the conference, in Habrapost not to describe each, but you can describe some general trends.  What were they like this time? <br><br>  For example, ‚Äúgiantomania‚Äù was noticeable: at once in several reports they shared their experience in working on especially large applications, from Uber to Sberbank Online.  Both <b>Anton Schukin</b> (Badoo), and <b>Nikolai Lihogrud</b> (Yandex), and <b>Alexander Blinov</b> (hh.ru) from different sides revealed the topic of modularization that is relevant for large scale.  And <b>Artyom Zinnatullin</b> (Lyft), who appeared on the stage after Alexander, slightly trolled him by comparing the number of modules in hh.ru and Lyft:

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/og/ip/fq/ogipfqqves5d8uxqoyf8-amlpyo.png"><br><br>  But at the same time, the conference did not turn into an event where giants measure themselves with lines of code, and developers from smaller companies feel themselves superfluous.  The same Artem immediately noticed that the main thing in his report ‚ÄúAndroid Builds at Lyft‚Äù is not a specific situation in one particular company, but general engineering principles, suitable for various cases.  And he led the conversation from afar, starting with the assembly with the help of Bash, Make and Ant: it was possible to follow the development of the assembly tools, understanding what problem they were solving at each particular turn.  By the way, after the report, he developed a topic with a <a href="https://artemzin.com/blog/fundamental-design-issues-of-gradle-build-system/">blog post</a> about what features of Gradle make it difficult to scale it into hundreds of modules. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nn/zy/2_/nnzy2_3ezfieypspsfqnrukb2mc.jpeg"><br><br>  Another trend is the transfer of the video about which both of the largest Russian social networks made a report at once.  <b>Alexey Savin</b> (VKontakte) talked about video broadcasts, and <b>Alexander Tobol</b> and <b>Ivan Grigoriev</b> (Odnoklassniki) talked about live broadcasts and previously recorded video, going down from ready-made video players to the level of sockets and codecs.  An impressive detail from the second report: ‚Äú4K support appeared to us‚Äú for growth ‚Äù, there was no need for it yet, we just decided that if 4K could be implemented normally, then everything in 1080p will definitely work well‚Äù.  Here one would have thought that the speakers from these two social networks performed mostly for each other (who else does high-loaded mobile video broadcasts in Russia?) - but no, the other viewers on these reports were also, and many of them were impressed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nx/rj/xn/nxrjxnj7k0yla_qflmmshssueey.jpeg"><br><br>  There were two more ‚Äúsymmetrical‚Äù reports: about Flutter ( <b>Paulina Shklarska</b> spoke) and about using Kotlin for a common code for Android / iOS ( <b>Svyatoslav Shcherbina</b> directly from JetBrains).  Both reports are about cross-platform development, and both technologies are not very mature, but promising.  But at the same time their approaches are very different - and just by going to both reports, it was possible to feel the difference.  A detail that impressed me personally: I already heard about the Hot Reload feature in Flutter development, but I perceived it simply as ‚Äúthe ability to restart the application immediately after changing the code‚Äù, and only then I saw that it was stateful (when restarted, the data entered in the interface ).  Feelings such as if the plane can be replaced wing right during the flight. <br><br>  Both technologies are now actively developing, and with Flutter it turned out most clearly.  First, when we announced the report, the technology was still in beta - and just a few days before Mobius version 1.0 was released, making the topic more relevant.  And secondly, Paulina began to prepare a speech in the status of an Android developer ‚Äî but in the course of her career, she even went so far as to officially introduce herself as ‚ÄúFlutter developer‚Äù on Mobius. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tm/su/zc/tmsuzc63z-oqejp_rbiarzcms-e.jpeg"><br><br>  Another parallel can be drawn between the presentations of <b>Jonathan Levin</b> and <b>Vitaly Friedman</b> : both of these speakers love not only to monotonously express something, but to hold a show and engage the audience.  This is well suited for the closing speeches of the conference, and visitors to previous Mobius will surely remember the keynotes of Jonathan, and this time Vitaly closed with the theme ‚ÄúExtreme testing: tricks from the dark corners of mobile interfaces.‚Äù  Jonathan also made a "serious" report on the Android-insides (D8, R8, and so on) - but the fact that he climbed deep and focused on the cognitive component, still did not prevent him from reviving this topic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/go/0j/mp/go0jmprw3y6pc7enfbxqot85r2q.jpeg"><br><br>  Everything does not happen perfectly, at any major event, someone is inevitably disappointing someone - and judging by the reviews that have come to the moment, even here a couple came to light.  <b>Dag Sillars</b> ' opening keynote on image optimization and <b>Paul Hudson</b> ‚Äôs Squeeze Your Swift report were liked by some viewers, while others were challenged by ‚ÄúAlthough the speaker‚Äôs presentation is professional, the content is too superficial, which we don‚Äôt know here.‚Äù <br><br>  Well, it remains to be glad that the participation of the speakers in the conference was not limited to the stage: they could be properly questioned by adding all that was missing in the report.  And here we come to the second important part of the conference: <br><br><h2>  Communication </h2><br>  First, the report on Mobius is more than a report: it is always also a discussion zone after it, where the speaker has time to answer all the questions in detail.  When someone famous arrives, viewers usually have a lot of questions about the report and other topics.  And, for example, Artem Zinnatullin was surrounded so that he and his beard looked almost like a preacher: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/st/4w/y2/st4wy2p0mnb8syo_n6wgprzo268.jpeg"><br><br>  Secondly, this time we did the Ask Expert zone as well: some speakers specializing in a particular area were ready to answer any questions about it at a certain time.  Artyom took part in this and again gathered a lot of people in the Ask Expert zone - it seems they can ask him endlessly. <br><br>  Thirdly, in the evening of the first day the BOF-sessions were traditionally held: thematic discussions, where anyone could participate.  This time in Russian, professional burnout was discussed, and in English (with the participation of foreign speakers) interviews. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ea/ud/sm/eaudsmmscbc-z8gsyvcbphucz5a.jpeg"><br><br>  How did these discussions go?  Here opinions are divided.  Someone thought that the topics were too banal, and there was a lot of captaincy in concrete remarks, but others participated so lively and for a long time, as if the second day of reports had not been waiting for them. <br><br>  Fourthly, the communication takes place at the stands of companies - and at these stands was a lot of bright.  Yandex in the case of Yandex.Avto presented both a serious interactive (rack with a screen that allows you to personally poke into the Auto interface), and a frivolous (race track with toy cars), and the presence of <b>Anton Dudakov</b> (who spoke at the previous Mobius) allowed to ask about "Auto" technical questions of any complexity.  The loudest recent news, ‚ÄúYandex.Telefon‚Äù, was also not left unattended: the company held a contest for mobile phones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bn/sm/he/bnsmhetavmcm_a01zswtgk7cmri.jpeg"><br><br>  But it seems that Badoo won out by the audience of all, making the game ‚ÄúIT Alias‚Äù for its stand.  Nastol lovers know that ‚ÄúAlias‚Äù is good with a low entry threshold: to understand the rules, just a minute is enough (‚Äúexplain the words from the cards so that they are guessed as quickly as possible‚Äù), and then everyone has fun.  And in this case, where Badoo used the words familiar to developers (‚ÄúGPU‚Äù, ‚Äúregression testing‚Äù, ‚Äúpatch‚Äù), it turned out even more fun - and as a result both days were briskly chopped up on the company's stand. <br><br>  Finally, fifth, at conferences there is another form of communication: it is dictated not by some predetermined zones and schedules, but by the self-organization of the community.  When people gather in one place, following with interest the posts and podcasts of each other, of course, they immediately begin to communicate with interest.  And on this Mobius has traditionally been recorded a special <a href="https://androiddev.apptractor.ru/android-dev-podkast-81/">edition of the</a> ‚ÄúAndroid Dev Podcast‚Äù.  Co-host of the podcast <b>Denis Neklyudov</b> , who had participated in Mobius many times before, could not get to the event this time - but eventually he bit his elbows while reading the conference chat. <br><br>  In general, from our side the conference looked like this.  But a great event is always seen in different ways - for example, Vladimir Ivanov, a member of the program committee, had the following opinion: <br><br><div class="oembed"><twitter-widget class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" id="twitter-widget-0" style="position: absolute; visibility: hidden; display: block; transform: rotate(0deg); max-width: 100%; width: 500px; min-width: 220px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" data-tweet-id="1071846154445484033"></twitter-widget><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en_US" data-twitter-extracted-i1550838122117106486="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">  For me, latest <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/mobiusconf%3Fsrc%3Dhash%26ref_src%3Dtwsrc%255Etfw">#mobiusconf</a> is not about the ci / cd pipeline, automation or programming languages.  It is much closer than you think. </p>  - Vladimir Ivanov (@vvsevolodovich) <a href="https://twitter.com/vvsevolodovich/status/1071846154445484033%3Fref_src%3Dtwsrc%255Etfw">December 9, 2018</a> </blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br><br><h2>  What's next? </h2><br>  About spring Mobius Petersburg, we can now say this: <br><br><ul><li>  Date: May 22-23, 2019. </li><li>  Place: the same as before (Hotel Park Inn by Radisson Pulkovskaya) </li><li>  Format: the same as before.  Specific reports will be different - but again you can wait and dive into the depths, and something fun;  and architectural issues, and the analysis of specific technologies;  and inquiries in the discussion areas, and discussions on a given topic. </li><li>  Tickets: already <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/registration/">on sale</a> , and will gradually go up, starting from January 1.  So, if you are ready to be determined before the appearance of the full program, then it is most advantageous to do it right now. </li></ul><br>  In general, we are pleased with how many people were with us this weekend - and until the next meeting in St. Petersburg! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/432230/">https://habr.com/ru/post/432230/</a></p>
