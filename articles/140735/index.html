Part 1 "Positioning"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The other day I talked with a beginner ‚Äúwebdesigner‚Äù, which, although it makes sites like ‚Äúabove average‚Äù, but sits without orders.  We talked with him for about 2 hours. As a result, he said, ‚ÄúTimur, here I am &lt;ash sprinkling&gt; turns out!‚Äù. <br><br>  Thinking a little bit, I decided to lay out an exclusive, something like a young fighter's course for free artists who create on the Internet and want to make a quick start and a powerful financial sprint in this field in the future. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To make it clearer about the effectiveness of these steps, I‚Äôll give the ORDER of the coefficients of the envelope of sales meetings (that is, meetings where I sell my services): <br><br><ul><li>  Hot market (acquaintances, friends) - 95% (naturally) </li><li>  Warm market (recommendations) - 80% </li><li>  Cold market - 60% </li></ul><br>  I repeat - this is the order of numbers, so please do not hesitate to write about this topic.  Judging by the communication with my friends salespeople, these are very good indicators.

      The technique, which is described below, was developed evolutionarily.  My target audience is small and medium business.  I work on my own, as a ‚Äústudio man‚Äù, i.e.  I am engaged in a full development cycle, starting from sales and ending directly with the development of sites and its delivery to the customer.  I recommend to start with this and not to go to the web studio to hire.  After reading the article to the end, you will understand why. <br><br>  If you have ever sold services, then faced with a bunch of objections and questions that fell in your address.  In fact, all these questions can be reduced to 4 questions: <br><br><ul><li>  Who are you? </li><li>  What do you want? </li><li>  What will I get if I do, as you suggest? </li><li>  How much is it? </li></ul><br>  These questions need to be answered, but all your answers will generate new questions and new suspicions.  I suggest - to make it so that they occur at a minimum.  And one of the ways to minimize the killing of your nerve cells is called "positioning." <br><br>  There are a lot of definitions (as well as its borders) of this marketing term.  I will save your time and give my own, in relation to our specific situation: Positioning is how we want the customer to perceive us.  I will give 2 options.  The first is common, the second is which I use. <br><br>  To make it clear what this is about, I suggest that you simplify the situation to the maximum.  And imagine the incredible: you came to a meeting with the customer, and his forehead has a built-in 3-inch screen (like a normal size, yes?) Translating his thoughts.  So, how would the meeting look like: <br><br><h5>  Positioning "I'm a cool designer / programmer" </h5><br>  <b>He (flashed on the screen):</b> who are you? <br>  <b>You:</b> I'm a cool designer / programmer <br>  <b>He:</b> so, I need a website ... I still don‚Äôt know exactly which one, most likely the competitors will have.  Show that you can, and I will decide what I need.  Is there a portfolio? <br>  <b>You:</b> yes of course, here is the address <a href="http://www.site.ru/portfolio">www.site.ru/portfolio</a> <br>  <b>He:</b> so ... well, I need a beautiful site ... I need to surprise the visitor with what I remember.  It is also necessary, as the competitors had what it was, that‚Äôs how they <a href="http://www.konkurent.ru/">can</a> see <a href="http://www.konkurent.ru/">www.konkurent.ru</a> ... just to add on the red background and not the blue one and add the nude girl in the cap.  I think it will trample ... <br>  <b>You:</b> easy! <br>  <b>He:</b> so ... and how much your services cost? <br>  <b>You:</b> Nnn bucks. <br>  <b>He:</b> Oh!  and one student offered me for Nn ... <br>  <b>You:</b> well, you know, it's not as cool as I, I will make it cooler faster, more functional <br>  <b>He:</b> so, how can you evaluate that ... and should I be faster?  And do I need more functionality?  Well, if your gift of persuasion is stronger than my desire to save n bucks, then perhaps I will agree.  Ato is not clear whether it will work or not, we must first try.  It does not work, at least I will save. <br><br><h5>  Positioning "I am the owner of the site" </h5><br>  <b>He:</b> Who are you? <br>  <b>You:</b> I am the owner of the site <a href="http://www.site.ru/">www.site.ru</a> , which is additionally engaged in the development of sites <br>  <b>He:</b> Hmm, interesting, and you can see? <br>  <b>You:</b> Yes, here is the site <a href="http://www.site.ru/">www.site.ru</a> <br>  <b>He:</b> I see.  I need a website that brings customers, I am ready to invest in it, provided that what you offer really works. <br>  <b>You:</b> Well, look: <a href="http://www.site.ru/admin/orders">www.site.ru/admin/orders</a> , this week has received N orders <br>  <b>He:</b> That is, you are now offering me the same thing as you? <br>  <b>You:</b> yes.  Only taking into account your specifics. <br>  <b>He:</b> do you have a portfolio? <br>  <b>You:</b> which portfolio?  Orders are my portfolio <br>  <b>He:</b> yes, exactly ... Well, that‚Äôs interesting to me.  What is required of me? <br>  <b>You:</b> I'm unfortunately not a good designer, so I‚Äôll just buy from a pro, I did it.  The local designers of prices break and do not do well, I found a site with professional templates, I will select for you 5 pieces which are best from my point of view and then we will discuss which is best.  OK? <br>  <b>He:</b> OK!  Thanks for saving me from these nuances and arts.  Ato was here one designer / programmer, I need to earn money here, and he loaded me with some kind of CMS, jpg, xml ... By the way, how much does it cost? <br>  <b>You:</b> nnnn bucks. <br>  <b>He:</b> O_o !!!  and one student offered me for Nn ... <br>  <b>You:</b> well, of course then go to the student, I would go, if I knew how to make it work!  After all, he will do everything you want, whether you can earn money on this issue or not - I don‚Äôt know, I had xyz projects, most of them did not give any clients, this one works.  Therefore, I know what works and what does not and I know all the nuances. <br>  <b>He:</b> yes, yes ... you seem to be safer, you don't want to risk ... <br><br><h5>  Summary </h5><br>  This positioning, in fact, affects the whole process of your interaction with the customer.  You are in this case, become on an equal footing with you, both of you are site owners.  You know how it works, he- no.  Therefore, YOU say what and how to do, and instead of moving pixels on the screen, do really important things. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/140735/">https://habr.com/ru/post/140735/</a></p>
