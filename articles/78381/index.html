It's about the LG <b>42LF2510</b> LCD TV <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f83/082/571/f8308257108773dade2aace53635333c.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I was puzzled by the purchase of a large TV.  I searched for a long time, chose: where is cheaper, which is better.  The main characteristics were support for FullHD, a contrast of at least 50000: 1, USB as a nice addition, Ethernet as a novelty in TVs.  Such novelty has been found only in Sony TVs.  USB could be met more often than Ethernet.  After careful selection, Sony Bravia KDL-40V5610 was chosen.  For a number of financial reasons, they decided to take something budget. <br>  Suddenly I went to MVideo and my eyes fell on the low-cost LG model.  I am not very trusting about this brand, but soon I was struck by the possibilities of this TV.  Unfortunately, as it turned out USB in this TV, though there is, but it is a service one.  What was my surprise when I started reading reviews on it: it turns out this TV can play video files with quite a <a href="">few</a> formats.  And most importantly, MKV files :)) <br><br>  Thus, it was this model that was purchased ... After buying, the <b>LG <a href="">42LF2510 was</a></b> puzzled by the inclusion of the option to play files from a flash drive, which was a huge plus for this device and without this ability it would not be used 100% for watching movies, because  My DVD (Pioneer AV610) can't read MKV. <br>  A couple of resources were explored: the familiar ixbt.com and not the foreign avforums.com.  Where I found the answers to activate the playback via USB. <br><br>  In order to find out the current firmware -&gt; <br><ol><li>  Go to the <i>Menu</i> by pressing the key of the same name on the remote control (remote control). </li><li>  Select <i>Options</i> (but do not click) </li><li>  Press the <b>FAV</b> button (bottom right of the remote control) <b>7</b> times </li><li>  We are in flashing mode.  The first line is your firmware version. </li></ol><br>  Attention if the version is below 3.4 then you can downgrade to firmware 3.15.  Call the engineering menu by holding the OK key on the remote control and on the TV.  (or MENU in later versions).  <u>If the version is 3.47 or 3.48, then when you downgrade your TV will turn into a brick</u> 
      <br>

        </script>
      <br>
      And so the first option: <br>  You need to downgrade to 3.15, activate USB, upgrade to your own firmware or more recent. <br><br>  The second option: the service menu can be called by sending a specific code to the receiver.  Ways to do it: service console <br>  emulation programs for Symbian and WinMobile <br><br>  In the first version there is a lot of information on the Russian-language forum ixbt, and there is very little information about activation using a diode (there is a link to the FAQ at the end).  I decided on this option, because I was confused by some of the risks when reflashing. <br><br>  As a result, the following was done to activate USB: <br><ol><li>  One LED was taken from the rear bicycle lantern (as it was useless it was soldered back without consequences). </li><li>  Wire from old headphones with 3.5mm jack. </li><li>  LED is soldered so that it is on (observing polarity) </li><li>  On the iphone was played specials.  file. </li></ol>  The instructions say that you need to play cyclically changing the volume.  I chose not to change the volume and the distance to the receiver on the TV. <br><br>  2-5 seconds and the TV asks for a password.  Press "0000" on the remote.  Enter the service menu. <br>  -&gt; change the TWO settings - DivX - HD (or SD) and allow showing JPEG (set 1). <br>  Here "EMF (Jpeg, MP3)", set the value to "1" (the keys "right" and "left") <br>  DIVX set to ‚ÄúHD‚Äù (right and left keys) <br>  Do not change anything else.  You may damage the TV and lose the warranty on it. <br><br>  Voila  I tried immediately MKV.  Works!!!  Without brakingoff.  The DVD is standing next to off ... and why is it now?) <br><br>  <b>Applications</b> : <br>  Sound file - <a href="http://ifolder.ru/15497754">download</a> <br>  FAQ on all this - <a href="http://forum.ixbt.com/print/0062/015861.html">watch</a> <br>  Wiki about activation and firmware - <a href="http://lgusb.wikispaces.com/">watch</a> <br><br>  PS: I apologize for mistakes and transition of thoughts, hurry to share on emotions) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/78381/">https://habr.com/ru/post/78381/</a></p>
