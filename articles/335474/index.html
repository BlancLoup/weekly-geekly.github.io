Therefore, users often do not even suspect that the best mobile application has already been developed and published. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c29/990/d02/c29990d0266a5b695f39cf7bb838eef9.png"><br>  <i>- So you do not read the "Podium".</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Not.</i> <i><br></i>  <i><b>- And never heard of me?</b></i> <i><b><br></b></i>  <i><b>- Not.</b></i> <br><br>  Do not think that users will find the application on their own in the store ... and be sure to install it.  Users like applications, they install them.  Good apps even use regularly.  However, the user is not ready to spend several hours searching for an application.  Therefore, the application must be in the top.  More than half of users install mobile programs, seeing them in the first positions of categories or search in the store. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/127/217/7d1/1272177d1bbf2e4c0ce4de5ea2a8786a.gif"><br>  <i>- Who is it?</i>

      For promotion to the top, a complex advertising campaign is needed: targeted advertising, promotion in public, mobile banner networks, motivated traffic, unmotivated installations.  All this requires not only impressive cash costs, but also remarkable creativity, for example, your press release will not be published, if it is not interestingly written, it has no images or they are of poor quality, not to mention video content.  If you provide a good product with high-quality marketing, it will definitely find its consumer.  And it does not always depend on finances.  Here are some tips on how you can take care of advertising yourself before launching the application without spending a penny or a cent.  As well as a few tips after the start of sales, if you still forgot about the promotion. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/18c/74c/89e/18c74c89eeda8c740b6cd2194da673f8.gif"><br>  <i>‚ÄúI am just learning to understand all these things ...‚Äù</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- "In these clothes"?</i> <br><br><h2>  Keep a blog </h2><br>  Please don't shut up.  No one is going to steal your code or spoil ideas.  Share how you develop the product.  This is not only an investment in the future, but also current analytics.  At the initial stage, you will determine with less cost whether there are bugs or errors.  In the future, when alpha-beta versions of the application will be available to users, marketing will let you know whether it is worth further opening the traffic tap, or if something else needs to be improved. <br><br>  Do not get carried away.  Do not write notes of several thousand characters.  If the temptation to write a literary work is too great, use Twitter: 140 characters are enough to remind you about yourself, but not enough to take away your valuable working hours.  Posts should be regular, but not more than 2 times a week. <br><br><h2>  Match </h2><br>  If you are making an application for fashion bloggers, remove the stretched sweater.  Create a product for athletes?  Do at least one charge.  According to the mind you need to have a representative who will correspond to your application, an advertising person, so to speak.  Or have a separate working account on social networks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/470/a92/28e/470a9228ed1f576cba90155768241d8f.gif"><br>  <i>- So, now - Chanel.</i>  <i>Chanel needed.</i> <br><br>  Transform your profile or create a working account: <br><br><h4>  - Avatar / profile photo </h4><br>  Put your photo.  The first impression depends on it.  In addition, confidence increases, your project no longer seems impersonal) Do not forget about the rest of the photos on your page.  Family photos, pictures with friends should be moved to a separate private album. <br><br><h4>  - Status / header on Twitter / Instagram description / Facebook cover </h4><br>  This is the same advertising channel.  Leave there a link to your application - a QR code or indicate links to groups in social networks.  Creative design is welcome here. <br><br><h4>  - Sign up for relevant groups; </h4><br>  And unsubscribe from any nonsense.  "Laugh out loud" and you can from a personal account.  But if you like the recitative performance of poems to the rhythmic music of domestic artists, then it is better to close the audio.  Public, to which you are subscribed, indicate the range of your interests.  It works in the opposite direction: people can find you among the group members.  Avoid public pages of political and religious orientation. <br><br><h4>  - Contact details </h4><br>  Leave the current contact information on the page - a phone number or mail.  Regarding the latter, be careful: the postal address must have a representative appearance, for example, contain your first and last name.  If possible, better get mail on your domain. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7fd/185/758/7fd185758bf9ed5be71d26407edfd241.gif"><br>  <i>- Do not tell me how to spell "Gabbana"?</i>  <i>Hello?</i> <br><br><h4>  - Privacy settings </h4><br>  Rid your friends and subscribers of unnecessary information: check in the settings of the page, what notifications from you will be displayed in the news feed.  It is better to leave a section with photos, themes, perhaps with friends, but changing personal information or adding new audio is unnecessary information. <br><br>  You can not imagine how often customers / consumers are meticulous about the history of the company or the composition of the team.  It will not be worse if you work on your corporate image, but this will definitely have a positive impact on customer loyalty. <br><br><h2>  Focus on target audience </h2><br><blockquote>  There is no fine line between ‚ÄúI like‚Äù and ‚Äúreally need / beautiful‚Äù.  This is a rather thick line and it is called <b>professionalism</b> . </blockquote><br>  If you like the combination of black and red colors, but you are developing an application for pregnant women, then you cannot use this color scheme, because in marketing there is a color psychology.  You will become a real specialist when you start to put a selling design above your preferences, because in the end you are creating a product for the consumer, not for yourself.  A similar situation with the developers.  Sometimes they chase popular tools, when the project is simpler, more reliable, and most importantly, more profitable to implement, using a different technology. <br><br><h2>  Communicate </h2><br>  Chat online.  This does not mean spamming under each post or enter into strife in the comments.  If you read / see something good - praise the author.  Have questions?  Ask them in the comments.  Can you answer someone's question?  Answer <br><br>  Chat offline.  Attend any event on your topic.  This is not only meetings of developers and designers, do not forget about profile events.  Developing an application for learning foreign languages?  Visit conversational clubs.  Do you have a financial assistant?  Go to financial literacy training.  However, remember that success at conferences is not equal to the success of the application, it is only companion marketing. <br><br>  Popularity is no excuse for bad behavior.  Even with several million subscribers, you can not afford to disrespect for them - mate, ignore, low-quality content as well.  Politeness and professionalism have never been condemned, and provocative marketing can sometimes go sideways: in most cases this is at least inappropriate, but at the most it is indecent. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b05/7db/58a/b057db58a2c53cdf674f543139d35e36.gif"><br>  <i>- Of course, move as slowly as possible.</i>  <i>You know how I love it.</i> <br><br><h2>  Do not forget about time </h2><br>  Do not break deadlines and deadlines.  Do not be late for conferences and meetings.  Do not drop out of social networks, your groups should not be empty.  At business events, the presenters always have some jokes or interesting stories in case of awkward pauses, for example, if the speaker is delayed or something happens to the projector.  Exactly you should also have ‚Äúspare‚Äù posts in case of a creative crisis or lack of time. <br><br>  It is necessary to promote the product before the release, however, if you are a novice developer and are so carried away with creating an application that you have completely forgotten about marketing, your advertising campaign has not yet failed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cf0/d72/950/cf0d729506d601063fe335f3a47e2faf.gif"><br>  <i>- So, attention.</i>  <i>Combat readiness!</i> <br><br>  Try the following marketing moves: <br><br><h3>  - Failure Stories </h3><br>  There are many sites where participants share their bad experiences.  Tell people what difficulties you encountered while developing the product, what conclusions were drawn.  In no case do not leave these stories without a paragraph about your future plans: finally start the advertising campaign in advance. <br><br><h3>  - Blog </h3><br>  Write a dev-story, since you have not done it before.  Surely you have saved videos or screenshots, perhaps interesting notes on the product creation process.  Tell novice developers how to do not.  Publish in your official sources (blog, website, groups in social networks) lists of useful web resources, mandatory events to attend, try writing a tutorial or small instructions. <br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  Many of us are able to recover from a cold without going to the doctor, however, such a profession is still there, because, firstly, a person with medical education knows a little more than us, secondly, a highly qualified specialist should perform serious operations, and Finally, some people simply do not understand medicine. <br><br>  If you make a small application for a narrow circle of acquaintances or for a small Central Asia, follow our advice and you will definitely succeed!  However, if you are developing a serious project or have made some mistakes in promotion and failed to start sales, better contact the advertising industry professionals. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/146/a27/afd/146a27afd7bcdca45f91f78512b6bb5a.gif"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/335474/">https://habr.com/ru/post/335474/</a></p>
