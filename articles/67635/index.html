Continuation of <a href="http://ksenobayt.habrahabr.ru/blog/67537/">snacks</a> about how Skylink remarkably steals from their own subscribers. <br>  <b>Update:</b> continuation of the story <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/prava/67744/">here</a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, they called me today from the office.  The same girl with whom I had the displeasure to communicate yesterday, in harsh colors, told me that no recalculation would happen - they say, we have perfect billing, and you have spent, and now you are complaining.  If you ignore the verbal diarrhea, which she poured on me, the essence comes down to the fact that de "bite it, kid." <br><br>  I must say that I am not surprised - 3/4 of the stories that I reviewed during the night at the Moscow Skye Forum are very similar to mine - they put the money, they followed the traffic closely - and hop, there is no money.  And no one says exactly where they disappeared - they say, our billing does not have the opportunity to show directions during the session.  Examples of stories and complaints can be seen, for example, <a href="http://forum.skylink.ru/article.aspx%3Faid%3D62264">here</a> and <a href="http://forum.skylink.ru/article.aspx%3Faid%3D63787">here</a> . <br><br>  Yes, perhaps, the attentive username will ask me - why the <b>hell</b> did I not hang up the application for the notorious <b>SkyPoint</b> (local analogy of the personal <b>account</b> for managing services on the Serpent site)?  And such that all troubles and other goodies are available only on the Moscow resource - even _free_detalization_ of traffic doesn‚Äôt work on my Tver site - that is, the very two lines.  It just does not work.  All that can be done there is to see the balance and look at the last calls in three days.

      We continue delicious.  During the time that has passed since the publication of the original habratopik, I managed to communicate with several colleagues from my city that I also used the services of the Dragon.  It should be noted that such cases took place to be with them - the amounts of incorrect write-offs started from 700 rubles and ended with eight thousand.  Naturally, no recalculation was done, as well as no details were provided that would demonstrate the directions in which traffic allegedly went. <br><br>  Residents of the <a href="http://cells.ru/">cells.ru</a> forum, meanwhile, <a href="http://www.cells.ru/forum/read.php%3F4,968297,968307">beacon</a> that de billing system used by Snake, and which for nine years at lunch, is not able to provide __ complete and detailed information on traffic directions.  But according to the Consumer Protection Code, these are not my problems, username ‚Äî I am required to provide a detailed account with the justification for writing off money.  Otherwise, it will be equivalent to receiving a bill for long-distance calls, where the amount and duration of the conversation will be indicated - but not that, with __, you talked. <br><br>  <b>Proceeding from all that I have managed to figure out for the last 24 hours, the outlook is as follows:</b> <br><br>  1) getting an _incomplete_ account that they are ready to provide - don't care what's good with it, like water from a stone, but it will be Ascard‚Äôs point of view <br>  2) collection of similar cases for tyrnets and their cataloging <br>  3) gathering of friends and comrades who have fallen into similar situations - and either their participation in future disassemblies as witnesses, or as ‚Äúlawsuits-in-law‚Äù, if it is collective <br>  4) connection to the Federal Antimonopoly Service of the Federal Antimonopoly Service and the Commission for the Protection of Consumer Rights, as well as competent IT specialists from my law school <br>  5) filing, in fact, the statement of claim and govnosrachik himself <br><br>  I do not know how realistic it is to sue the Serpent.  But to endure such rudeness and frank hype is already tired.  And if we succeed in overthrowing the Serpent, it will create a precedent in our Russian legal practice, and this will become a bell for the entire big trinity, which also has a stigma in a cannon. <br><br>  I am awaiting comments from the habrasoobshchestvo on the situation and the prospects I have drawn. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/67635/">https://habr.com/ru/post/67635/</a></p>
