From the point of view of free software users, this is a victory, since it will allow a person to install GNU / Linux or another free operating system instead of Windows 8. <br><br>  But it‚Äôs too early to celebrate the victory, because at the same time, Microsoft has added the disloyal requirement to the manufacturers of ARM-based computers - such as tablets, netbooks and smartphones: they are <em>required</em> to have their devices equipped with a limited download feature.  Such computers are designed so that the user can work only with Windows 8;  they prevent any user from installing a free operating system on them.  Since smartphones and tablets are one of the most widely used computing devices, it is vital for us to convey to the public a simple and clear warning of this threat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>Already know what it is about?</i>  <i>Then act now:</i>

It prevents the computer from launching unauthorized programs at startup.  This function could match its name as long as the <em>user</em> is able to allow the launch of the programs he wants to use, so that he could execute free programs written or modified by himself or by those he trusts. <br><br>  However, as long as these restrictions are implemented in such a way that they do not allow the user to download anything other than Windows, we would rather call this technique ‚Äúlimited download‚Äù, since such a requirement would be a disastrous restriction, and not a security function at all. <br><br>  Initially, Microsoft did not specify whether they would require computer manufacturers to implement a ‚Äúsafe‚Äù or ‚Äúlimited boot‚Äù to get the Windows 8 compatibility icon. <br><br>  For fear that they would require this, we issued a <a href="http://www.fsf.org/campaigns/secure-boot-vs-restricted-boot/statement">statement</a> calling ‚Äúfor all computer manufacturers to implement the so-called 'safe boot' UEFI so that it was possible to install free operating systems.‚Äù  (Since then, over 24,000 people have subscribed to our application). <br><br>  Then, trying to dispel these concerns, ‚ÄúMicrosoft‚Äù wrote a blog <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2011/09/22/protecting-the-pre-os-environment-with-uefi.aspx">post</a> stating that ‚ÄúMicrosoft‚Äù does not have any requirements for setting up the internal programs of personal computers that control or enable secure boot in any operating system other than Windows. <br><br>  <strong>But now we know that it was a lie.</strong> <br><br>  In December, Microsoft added the following requirement for computer manufacturers: <br><br><blockquote>  On non-ARM-based systems, you must implement the ability to disable secure boot.  The user should be able to disable secure boot without having a PKpriv.  [...] <br>  <strong>On ARM systems, disabling safe [boot] MUST NOT be</strong> .  (highlighting added) </blockquote><br>  As for non-ARM-based systems, we could consider it a victory, since Microsoft, apparently, does what is needed with respect to ordinary desktop computers.  However, we are not going to take their word for it, since they have already made a direct lie about this aspect - we will look after them and ensure that users have the ability to easily and easily manage security on their own machines. <br><br>  Next, we know they do wrong when it comes to ARM systems.  Users who have run into a computer, tablet or netbook based on ARM with Windows 8 will not be able to install free Android distributions like <a href="http://replicant.us/">Replicant</a> , or free GNU / Linux distributions like <a href="http://trisquel.info/">Trisquel</a> .  In fact, they can only install what Microsoft allows. <br><br>  Therefore, we must declare ourselves.  We need to let Microsoft know that we will not accept their limited load requirements, and we need to continually encourage manufacturers <br>  computers to implement their boot techniques so that the user can install their own customized and free operating systems. <br><br><h2>  Comic Contest </h2><br>  Millions of people will buy smartphones and tablets, so we absolutely need to clarify the importance of this issue to the general public - and not just to programmers.  What can attract people's attention and give them an informed review of the problem better than a comic? <br><br>  So, engage in exciting creativity, helping us to inform the public and influence Microsoft and computer manufacturers. <ul><li>  Join our <a href="http://www.fsf.org/campaigns/secure-boot-vs-restricted-boot/comic-contest">comic book contest</a> ! </li></ul>  We accept applications in the period until March 16.  Although we hope to publish all the comics we can, the best of them will be displayed on the fsf.org homepage for a month. <br><br><h2>  Signatures from enterprises, organizations and individuals </h2><br>  In addition to the more than 26,000 signatures we collected, I am pleased to announce that today we also added several signatures from companies and organizations, including FSF Europe, FSF Latin America, Fight for the Future, the Arab Digital Expression Foundation, Software Freedom Law Center and others. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.fsf.org/campaigns/secure-boot-vs-restricted-boot/statement">Please sign the application</a> as an individual if you have not done so already.  We also invite other companies and organizations <a href="http://www.fsf.org/campaigns/secure-boot-vs-restricted-boot/corp-org-signers">to sign</a> this document. <br><br><h2>  Support this work </h2><br>  Support this campaign, as well as the rest of the FSF, by <a href="https://my.fsf.org/associate/support_freedom/join_fsf%3Freferrer%3D10050">joining the FSF association today or by making a donation</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/139738/">https://habr.com/ru/post/139738/</a></p>
