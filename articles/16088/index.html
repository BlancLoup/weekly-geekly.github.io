  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Amie Street - monetization for musicians and especially for labels</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  If you have not read my <a href="http://egor.electrokids.org/prodolzhaem-istoriju-pro-amie-street/">past posts about this site</a> , then this is a <a href="http://amiestreet.com/members/signup.php%3Finvite_id%3D21341">music store selling mp3</a> , with an almost brilliant idea.  Namely: they give each participant in the process of acquiring music exactly what this participant needs.  The musician needs listeners first.  Then buyers.  Well, in the end, warm words about music.  The buyer needs the music itself and an easy and fast way to distinguish music worth buying from passable tracks, of which everywhere and always 90%.  A fan and a music lover, besides the music itself, is always pleased to express their opinion so that someone interested will hear it.  Well, if possible, a bonus if you don‚Äôt get the music itself for free in exchange for this opinion, then at least a discount on music, at least for wholesale quantities of its consumption.  All three categories of site users deprived of it do not go away.  Yes, small drawbacks like the impossibility to determine the quality of music you buy before purchasing, the mysterious musical tastes of the website editors and the selectivity in communication between the website creators and the outside world are certainly present, but compared to other advantages, they are very insignificant.  And against the background of the money I received from the site for music in an amount already exceeding everything that we, as musicians, have earned on sales of our CDs in the entire history, I don‚Äôt want to notice the disadvantages.  Yes, they listen and buy music there.  Yes, the desired track can be purchased if not completely free, then very cheaply.  Yes, you can get money from sales and quite easily.  Yes, the opinion of the listener plays a role and influences the further fate of the music itself.  Why then do not I call there all the musicians?  Listeners, by the way, <a href="http://amiestreet.com/members/signup.php%3Finvite_id%3D21341">call</a> .  <a href="http://amiestreet.com/members/signup.php%3Finvite_id%3D31269">Here is the</a> <a href="http://amiestreet.com/members/signup.php%3Finvite_id%3D29775">link</a> , please.  <a href="http://amiestreet.com/members/signup.php%3Finvite_id%3D22333">Not even alone</a> .  On the one hand, in the couple of months I spent a decent amount of time on this site, quite a lot of musicians learned from him who tried to sell their music there.  Nobody has any significant results yet.  And I do not think that they will.  Yes, the same Tiesto, when it appeared on <a href="http://amiestreet.com/members/signup.php%3Finvite_id%3D31269">Amie Street,</a> climbed to the top of the charts in a matter of hours.  But when it comes to musicians who do not have such fame as Tiesto or The Presidents of the USA, in addition to really good music for financial success, you also need to make efforts to promote.  How exactly they are applied by an ordinary musician during the time that he <a href="http://amiestreet.com/members/signup.php%3Finvite_id%3D29775">uploads</a> his album or two on <a href="http://amiestreet.com/members/signup.php%3Finvite_id%3D29775">Amie</a> does not have time to figure it out.  And the old experience of promoting outside this site does not always work.  Well, some tsiferok and common sense: I filled in several hundred tracks in <a href="http://amiestreet.com/members/signup.php%3Finvite_id%3D31269">Amie Street</a> .  Fortunately, I have been releasing music in the real world for a long time and the catalog of records has accumulated decent.  On average, each track today earned about 2 dollars.  I remind you that bringing money to a musician, and not just to a store, after at least $ 5 has been paid for by buyers.  If you still have in mind that very, very many still pay for traffic, then the prospects for earning money on <a href="http://amiestreet.com/members/signup.php%3Finvite_id%3D21341">Amie Street</a> to the musician himself cease to be so rosy.  So I continue to offer my services as an intermediary.  From you music, from me advancement and statistics of sales by the first inquiry.  Though daily.  The first musician who showed a desire and passed the minimum selection has the right to count on 100% of the money received from the store.  From all those who will be late I will take a small percentage of sales.  So it goes, <br>  Egor. <br>  Dreamlin Group, Electrokids Promotion Group, Gizmo Lab, Collaps and Adekvat Rec. </div>
