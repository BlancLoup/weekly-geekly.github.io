Part 2: Promotion in the Russian App Store</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today we will talk about the progress in the Russian App Store on the example of the application ‚Äú <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/skorogovorki-na-kartonke./id610298855">tongues on a carton</a> ‚Äù.  Since writing the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/osc/blog/174523/">previous post,</a> we have accumulated enough material, and now we want to share experiences with readers. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3b2/9f1/669/3b29f166903e9bb6fde1c0c56200acc0.png" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Monetization </h4><br>  Recall that the main target audience of the application is children, and there is a number of limitations in the monetization of children's applications: <br>  ‚Ä¢ built-in advertising.  Parents are extremely negative about banners inside children's applications. <br>  ‚Ä¢ built-in purchases.  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/176529/">There are cases</a> when children spent thousands of euros on in-app purchase.  Therefore, many parents do not trust applications with in-game purchases. <br><br>  If you look at the Top Cash Applications of the Education category, we will see that only 10% of them are free (not counting language, which are clearly not intended for children).  Most successful educational products are distributed on the Premium model when the user pays for the full version. <br>  Despite this, we decided to experiment and release 2 versions of the application: <br>  ‚Ä¢ free with an upgrade to the full version, that is, with just one IAP.  As our experience has shown, the availability of the free version increases profits by 20‚Äì30%. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Paid version for users who prefer Premium.

    <h4>  App Store Optimization </h4><br>  Like most of our applications, a collection of tongue twisters is a niche product with a rather narrow audience.  Therefore, when promoting, we pay great attention to search engine optimization (ASO).  The essence of ASO is the correct selection of the name and keywords.  On Habr√© already have detailed articles on the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/180853/">topic of ASO</a> , so we will not dwell on this.  We denote only a number of observations from personal experience: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ App Store does not understand case declinations and plural.  For example, the application ‚ÄúRussian tongues‚Äù will not be searched for the query ‚ÄúRussian‚Äù.  Therefore, keywords must exactly match the search query. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ A total of 100 characters can be added to the keyword field.  But do not forget about the name, which will fit another 140 Cyrillic characters.  Although many applications with keywords in the titles get Reject from Apple, very often this method works.  So, more than half of our applications have quietly been tested and bring a steady income. <br><br>  For example, we present a visual image: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1ac/70a/fc8/1ac70afc86c80c6fbb293b8b5c018f1c.png" alt="image"><br><br>  After we added keywords to the title, the number of installations increased by 30%. <br><br><h4>  Tops Russian App Store </h4><br>  Our first goal was to get into the top 5 Education categories, look at the organic applications and its monetization.  As for the general top, it is extremely difficult for the educational application to compete with other categories.  If you look at the top 100 paid, free, and cash register applications, you will notice that only 2-3% of the educational programs get there. <br>  First of all, we sent out letters to Russian review sites.  Of course, the main goal is publishing on popular resources: <a href="http://www.iphones.ru/">iphones.ru</a> , <a href="http://ipadstory.ru/">ipadstory.ru</a> , <a href="http://4pda.ru/">w3bsit3-dns.com</a> , <a href="http://planetiphone.ru/">planetiphone.ru</a> , <a href="http://appleinsider.ru/">appleinsider.ru</a> , <a href="http://macradar.ru/">macradar.ru</a> .  Other sites do not bring much effect, so publishing on them makes sense only for free.  Thus, we sent letters to 80 resources and received 12 free reviews.  Great luck was the answer from <i>iphones.ru</i> , who agreed to write a paid <a href="http://www.iphones.ru/iNotes/293809">review of the</a> application.  The publication on this resource brought 3000 installations per day and contributed to getting to the tops: <br>  ‚Ä¢ # 1 Top Free Education Russia <br>  ‚Ä¢ # 108 Top Free Overall Russia <br>  Thus, we achieved our first goal.  The application hit the top of Education and even approached the total top 100.  However, the application's organics turned out to be lower than we expected: in 10 days, the application came out of the Top-10 Education and Top-300 Overall. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/860/b24/f65/860b24f650d92eb8520ea5c174aa8712.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Next, we analyzed the effect of the reviews and the top: the conversion, and therefore the ARPU, decreased by 2 times.  Considering how much it would cost to get to the top of the Education through the purchase of installations from <a href="http://www.flurry.com/">flurry</a> and <a href="https://www.chartboost.com/">chartboost</a> , we came to the conclusion that this way of promotion for Skorogovorok would be unprofitable. <br><br><h4>  SMM promotion </h4><br>  At the next stage, we decided to attract an audience with the help of the contest: ‚ÄúSend a tongue twister and win an iPad Mini.‚Äù  To do this, they released an update to the application and added the ‚ÄúFolk art‚Äù column, in which users can leave their tongue twisters.  The author of the most original patter gets a prize - iPad Mini. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/49a/3c8/a94/49a3c8a946b53e4f0cbfa67b8a1e39cf.png" alt="image"><br>  The mechanics of the competition were not the easiest: <br>  1) Download the app from the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/skorogovorki-na-kartonke./id610298855">App Store</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dair.OSC.patters">Google Play</a> ; <br>  2) Share it with your friends on VKontakte or Facebook; <br>  3) Become a member of the Online Science Classroom group on <a href="">Facebook</a> or <a href="http://vk.com/oscteam_llc">VKontakte</a> ; <br>  4) Leave your patter in the group. <br><br>  All patters are moderated, after which the best of them are added to the application. <br>  It was decided to promote the contest using SMM (Social Media Marketing, or promotion on social networks).  To begin with, we identified the target audience - parents and users of mobile devices.  Next, they compiled a list of popular VKontakte communities with selected Central Asia and agreed to post posts.  As a rule, all communities place only paid advertising, unless you are interested in their lucrative offer.  The price of 1 post depends on the number of subscribers: <br>  ‚Ä¢&gt; 1 000 000 participants = 800‚Äì2500 rubles. <br>  ‚Ä¢ 300,000 participants = 600‚Äì800 rubles. <br>  ‚Ä¢ 50,000 participants = 150‚Äì250 rubles. <br>  ‚Ä¢ &lt;50,000 participants = 50‚Äì100 rubles. <br><br>  Posts in small groups (less than 10,000 subscribers) do not bring effect, therefore paid advertising in them is useless. <br>  The best advertising time is 19‚Äì23 hours.  At this time, there is the most active user activity. <br>  When choosing a community, consider the following characteristics: <br>  ‚Ä¢ number of unique visitors per day <br>  ‚Ä¢ user activity: the number of likes, reposts and comments <br>  ‚Ä¢ socio-demographic indicators: gender, age, region <br>  ‚Ä¢ subject and style of content <br>  ‚Ä¢ group development dynamics <br><br>  After the advertisement of the competition, the activity of users in the group increased significantly, however, this did not affect the installation settings. <br><br>  Summing up, we can conclude that holding competitions in social networks for the most part contributes to attracting subscribers to the community, and not to the application.  At the same time, the competition should have simple mechanics and a cheap, but effective prize. <br><br>  That's all for now, but we are not going to stop: we are planning to improve the application and look for new ways to promote. <br>  We are pleased to hear your comments and ideas. <br><br>  Always yours <br>  Online Science Classroom </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/181648/">https://habr.com/ru/post/181648/</a></p>
