One of the most notorious examples of recent times is the re-emerged electronics brand from a rap party. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4_/fl/m2/4_flm2duuslrrhcc8x8esueogjs.jpeg"><br><br>  Case Guru is no exception. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The range includes numerous charging wires, protective glasses, covers, and car adapters.  However, they got their HYIP in the final of last year thanks to <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/katalog/caseguru.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dcg%26utm_campaign%3Dkatalog">headphones and PowerBanks</a> .

      Frankly, the guys managed to catch a wave of interest in TWS, having gone literally on the heels of Elari, having connected top YouTube to the promotion.  About CGPods <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/medgadgets/blog/444188/">wrote here</a> .  And in fact, these are not the worst TWS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jx/g3/ub/jxg3ubqldmmxzncusjs7rv0qgfk.jpeg"><br><br>  The batteries that they delivered also turned out to be ‚Äútrendy‚Äù.  Wireless charging is increasingly penetrating our lives, so that banks look quite logical. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/92/ya/m5/92yam5g5dx8w8i84qqq5cp1ttgw.jpeg"><br><br>  And finally, another product - ordinary wireless headphones.  They failed to repeat the success of the TWS-model, despite the fact that they were still moving in the same top YouTube, but they found their buyer.  Jack holes are increasingly disappearing from the body of smartphones, so more and more people are looking for exactly that inexpensive alternatives to wired ears.  As a rule, these are hiking options for everyday headphones, for which there are no special complaints in terms of design and musical features: the main thing is the price. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vv/kf/ay/vvkfaytw_l8zzxs3yxia_21hf_0.jpeg"><br><br>  They sound, by the way, they are absolutely normal.  They honestly close their stated range, sound without squeaks, rattles at any volume, do not show delays in the video, so in their category ‚Äúdaily‚Äù they have a right to exist. <br><br>  By design and assembly - this is Chinese headphones, without outstanding attractive elements.  Modest plastic, three buttons, flat wire.  Wire, by the way, will not be tangled. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fj/jo/b0/fjjob0vcw183v6pifrig3uinrdi.jpeg"><br><br>  The buttons perform their usual functions: play / stop / answer a call, adjust the volume and flick through tracks.  In the same part, the battery is removed and there is a connector for charging. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fo/lj/id/foljidmquoioq4-39hhfxv2f-gc.jpeg"><br><br>  The battery is pretty decent.  In general, when dealing with different Chinese headphones, sometimes you have to carry two pairs with you.  Everything is much more decent here.  The stated playing time is 8 hours, this is a whole working day, this is quite a lot.  In general, Lucifer Season 4 (10 episodes of 40 minutes each) on one charge is easy (150 mAh). <br><br>  The red indicator indicates that the battery is charging.  That is charged, - blue.  To connect to a smartphone, you need to hold the central button for a long time until the moment when both lights start flashing alternately. <br><br>  The structure of the speakers is nothing unusual. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bx/8j/wr/bx8jwryswtzvpvp_rydzy5zjbsq.jpeg"><br><br>  These are classic comfortable earplugs with silicone ear cushions.  Headphones are in the name of "Sport", which implies their possible use during activities, so that in addition to the dynamics there is a special mount for a more tight fit in the ear.  It is removable.  Included are a few interchangeable accessories to fit everything in size. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_j/tr/sc/_jtrscce4moks9cpe4dl7iroxdq.jpeg"><br><br>  In general, let's be honest: CGPods headphones are primarily about comfort and convenience.  And these convenient little things can be found a lot except for good autonomy and interchangeable silicone tips. <br><br>  Here, for example, that especially liked.  There are such headphones in everyday life: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/w-/-q/zq/w--qzqnghoazta0h5l6xgwupvdy.jpeg"><br><br>  By and large, the essence is the same (although music creaks at high volume).  But here the unit with controls and the battery is located on one side only - there is no counterweight to it. <br><br>  Even with normal walking, this is a nuisance: it outweighs, the headphones often twist, several times when they were not inserted into the ear, but dangled around the neck, fell.  CGPods balanced this problem. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/aq/ik/tl/aqiktllejp8lnermopfktprgiby.jpeg"><br><br>  A trifle, but nice.  In addition, magnets that are in dynamics help to fix them in one equal position. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bk/tz/1l/bktz1li5npo3awlpev20-hds-cy.gif"><br><br>  It seems like a trifle, but again, this is very useful if the headphones often just hang around your neck.  The microphone in the headphones is there, audibility on both sides is acceptable for conversation.  The headphones communicate with the smartphone up to 10 meters away, the Bluetooth version is 4.1 (A2DP1.2 / AVRCP1.0 / HSP1.0 / HFP1.5). <br><br>  In other words, like headphones for every day is a normal decision.  They are light, really comfortable and give a decent sound for music and for TV shows.  Autonomy is enough for the whole day.  Headphones are available in <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/cgpodssportblack.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dcg%26utm_campaign%3Dblack">black</a> and <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/cgpodssportwh.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dcg%26utm_campaign%3Dwhite">white</a> .
