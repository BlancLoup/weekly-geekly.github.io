It lasts for three days, during which many sessions will be held on Google technologies and projects, focused primarily on developers. </p><br><p>  <a href="https://events.google.com/io/">Broadcast KeyNote</a> will begin at 20 o'clock Moscow time.  If you do not want to watch it alone, and are ready to immediately discuss all the news and news with colleagues in the workshop - come to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/avito.ru/forms/d/1uHqANYK145HdMod1LembHfAjBnJKe21j0AehiNftjwo">collective viewing</a> with us in Avito! </p><br><p>  And in this post we will share the main expectations from the conference and conjectures about the announcements of new products. </p><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2 id="android-o">  Android O </h2><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/d17/79d/1c4/d1779d1c43b64791a6e6c84e7260582c.jpg"><br>  Announcements of all new versions of Android were conducted on Google I / O.  Most likely, this year will not be an exception either.  In March, the company has already provided a developer assembly for everyone to experiment.  The latest previews of Android Studio 2.4 just contain changes to support the new version of Android: a new emulator, build tools, support library and other application development tools for the new version of API 26. </p><br><p>  Also announce the name of the new operating system.  We put on Android Oreo, and if this name is confirmed, it is quite expected that they can announce a joint advertising campaign with the same name cookie. </p><br><p>  In addition, the release of a second, more stable, version of the developer preview for the latest Pixel and Nexus devices is expected. </p><br><h2 id="fuchsia">  Fuchsia </h2><br><h4 id="pink--purple--fuchsia-a-new-operating-system">  Pink + Purple == Fuchsia (a new Operating System) </h4><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/5d4/cfe/195/5d4cfe195c2d4953b76147c122fa23ba.png"><br>  Fuchsia is Google's dark horse.  This is a new operating system, which is built around the core Magenta.  And, as it becomes clear from the source code, it can work both on familiar phones, tablets and desktop computers, and on IoT devices.  We are really looking forward to official information on Google I / O - it‚Äôs not for nothing that at the beginning of May small <a href="https://3dnews.ru/951907">handfuls of information</a> about the interface of the new system flowed into the network. </p><br><h2 id="google-home">  Google home </h2><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/3b2/e60/c1c/3b2e60c1ce5843ea8e378962ca0729c0.png"><br>  Google Home, a smart assistant column (similar to Amazon's Echo), is very popular in the USA.  It is likely that they will share with us the successes of this platform and announce its new features.  Integration with Google OnHub, Google's smart router, is possible to create a home Wi-Fi network.  There may also be a camera and monitor similar to the <a href="https://3dnews.ru/951868">new assistant</a> from Amazon. </p><br><h2 id="google-assistant">  Google Assistant </h2><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/a48/fc0/ab8/a48fc0ab881c4e198d17c9c5c3331ce6.jpg"><br>  Google Assistant is a virtual assistant that is present in Google Home, Allo and Pixel phones.  He can help plan the day, manage the smart home, book a table in a restaurant.  From Google I / O we are waiting for its release on other devices running Android and integration with new services. </p><br><h2 id="google-pixel">  Google pixel </h2><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/74b/364/bae/74b364bae215418b89d8cb9f91296ddd.png"><br>  Last year new phones were announced, replacing the Nexus line. </p><br><p>  We are waiting for the announcement of new Pixel, about which the entire Internet is full of <a href="https://androidinsider.ru/tag/google-pixel">leaks</a> .  What is interesting - there are rumors about the restoration of the Nexus as a line of available phones.  Some sources promise the appearance of an updated Nexus 5, in the past the most successful device lineup. </p><br><h2 id="daydream">  Daydream </h2><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/770/48a/054/77048a05494d41d4b06e4ea31b9225b2.jpg"><br>  Daydream was created in the wake of popularity and hype around VR technologies as the answer to Samsung Gear and other similar devices.  It consists of a headset and controller.  Available on Pixel phones and a number of other devices from partners. </p><br><p>  The second day of the conference contains many meetings dedicated to VR, so there‚Äôs probably a lot of updates waiting for the platform.  It is also possible to announce a full-featured VR headset, similar to the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift, but more simple and accessible. </p><br><h2 id="google-atap">  Google ATAP </h2><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/840/0d4/314/8400d43148914f17a7a0bc8b656144fe.png"></p><br><p>  ATAP is a team inside Google that conducts experiments using the latest technologies, for example Project Ara, Project Tango, Google Spotlight Stories. </p><br><p>  One of the most impressive projects is Jakarta.  It is a capacitive platform for clothing.  It can turn shirt sleeves into touch surfaces or quick action buttons. </p><br><p>  On Google I / O, we can quite hear about this or another project from the Google ATAP lab. </p><br><h2 id="android-wear">  Android wear </h2><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/771/062/bfc/771062bfc9564ee893940090035d0bb4.png"><br>  Three years have passed since the launch of Android Wear.  Last year, Android Wear 2.0 was announced with a modernized vertically oriented interface and support for Google Assistant.  This year we are awaiting the announcement of new features and cooperation with new watch manufacturers. </p><br><h2 id="allo-duo">  Allo duo </h2><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/5ab/162/5b6/5ab1625b6d304717a18c935c8a95f7ab.png"><br>  At Google I / O 2016 introduced two new applications for communication - text messenger Allo and program for video calls Duo.  By the way, Allo was the first application with integrated Google Assistant.  Since then, many updates have been released for both applications. </p><br><p>  On Twitter, the <a href="http%253A%252F%252F9to5google.com%252F2017%252F02%252F23%252Fsneak-peek-google-allo-desktop%252F">web interface for Allo is</a> lit up.  So, perhaps, we will show the new features of these applications. </p><br><h2 id="android-auto">  Android Auto </h2><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/af4/198/237/af419823784e465dae2253ec4976dc79.jpg"><br>  Android Auto is Google's vehicle platform.  Not so long ago, the platform received an update in the form of version 2.0, which added support for voice commands, improvements for applications, new alerts (weather, traffic jams) in real time. </p><br><p>  Expect that the number of brands of cars with support for Android Auto will grow. </p><br><h2 id="project-tango-ar">  Project Tango AR </h2><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/5c0/753/22d/5c075322d2f24d6ea4beb014e745f7de.jpg"></p><br><p>  News about Project Tango, from the ATAP lab, which is being developed in collaboration with Intel, is quite likely.  This is a computer vision platform for mobile devices.  Navigation inside the premises, building 3D maps of the rooms, measuring distances, augmented reality is only a small part of the tasks that can be solved with the help of Project Tango. </p><br><p>  The first consumer-oriented Tango phones are the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro, released last year, and the Asus ZenFone AR Tango, which has not yet been released.  Their releases have gone quite unnoticed, but we hope to hear more about Tango devices and the platform itself on this Google I / O. </p><br><p>  No matter how many rumors go on the Internet, and how many leaks wouldn‚Äôt be poured onto Reddit and Twitter, companies will still find something to surprise us.  We are waiting for all of our guests at Forest Street, 7. In addition to sharing Keynote, you will have competitions with cool staff, sandwiches and a great company! </p><br><p>  <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/avito.ru/forms/d/1uHqANYK145HdMod1LembHfAjBnJKe21j0AehiNftjwo"><strong>Registration form</strong></a> <br>  <strong>Address</strong> : 7, Forest Street, 15th floor <br>  <strong>Registration will start</strong> : May 17, 19:00 </p></div>
