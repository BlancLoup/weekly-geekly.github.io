      <br>
      So, I prophesy that ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>1. Presentation of the ‚Äúsite with a heavenly IP‚Äù</b> <br>  On April 12, 2026, the article ‚ÄúHidden shooting with a virtual camera‚Äù by nostro808 will be published on Habr√©.  The author will provide a link to an unknown resource, which will soon be called the ‚Äúsite with a heavenly IP‚Äù.  The resource will allow you to place a virtual camera (equipped with a microphone) at any point in space and receive a high-quality image from it.  The camera must be installed according to geographic coordinates, with an indication of the height above the earth's surface. <br><br>  <b>2. Collapse publication of clips in the network</b> <br>  In the first four hours after the presentation of the ‚Äúsite with the heavenly IP‚Äù, a rampant posting of clips recorded with the help of a new technology will occur.  Most of the clips will be personal, but not all: some media characters will receive coverage.  Many of them will appear in a form inappropriate to the public.  Also, through a live broadcast from secret objects, several state secrets will be revealed.  However, unlike media characters, nobody will pay attention to state secrets due to the confusion and confusion. <br><br>  <b>3. Lock article nostro808</b> <br>  Five hours after the presentation of the "site with the heavenly IP" article on Habr√© will be removed, and the profile nostro808 blocked forever.  The real name nostro808 will not be established: neither immediately nor later. <br><br>  <b>4. Attempts to block "the site with the heavenly IP"</b> <br>  Roskomnadzor will block the ‚Äúsite with a heavenly IP‚Äù six hours after its presentation.  However, the site will remain available not only through TOR, DNS-servers and VPN-services, but also through any provider, despite all the efforts made by those.  At the same time, destroying the site itself, unless, ironically, located in the domain zone ru, will not be possible due to the indeterminacy of the hosting and the site owner.  Hence the name of the resource: ‚Äúa site with a heavenly IP‚Äù.  On IT forums this issue will be released on the discussion in the first place.  For many years to come, the second place will be kept by the topic of installing a virtual camera at an arbitrary point in space. <br><br>  <b>5. The first limitation when using a virtual camera</b> <br>  On April 13, 2026, the first restriction will appear when using a virtual camera: it is impossible to specify a point of space above or below 2033 meters from the ground on the ‚Äúwebsite with a heavenly IP‚Äù.  There is no such restriction in the site interface, but when you go beyond the specified limits, the virtual camera is installed at a distance of 2033 meters.  Subsequently, the limiting distance will be clarified.  The number 2033, 27272727 ... will be called ‚Äúminimax‚Äù or simply ‚Äúminimax‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>6. Sky IP technology</b> <br>  On the same day, by the efforts of intrigued enthusiasts, it turns out that the ‚Äúheavenly IP‚Äù works on the principle of a decentralized Internet, parts of which program code are written in the BIOS of computer devices.  All computer devices of the planet Earth.  How are inscribed, science is not known.  Replacing the boards with new ones will not do anything, because after a while (3 to 5 hours from the start of using the device) the BIOS turns out to be spontaneously rewritten.  Various hypotheses will be put forward, most of which will be reduced to a statement of fact: the technologies of the ‚Äúsite with a celestial IP‚Äù are beyond human capabilities.  In a society, an understanding will be ripe that something extraordinary is happening with earthly civilization.  The new round of popularity will gain the concept of "Doomsday" and interference in earthly affairs of alien civilizations. <br><br>  <b>7. Sporadic crime spike</b> <br>  On April 14, 2026, law enforcement agencies will record the first crimes related to the use of the ‚Äúsite with the heavenly IP‚Äù.  Basically, theft of personal property (after all, from now on it costs nothing to determine whether someone is inside the premises).  Also crimes of jealousy: two men will kill wives caught with lovers. <br><br>  <b>8. The reaction of the international community</b> <br>  On April 25, 2026, an urgent UN meeting on information security will be held.  Statements by world leaders about the dangers of using non-tested technologies and calling on Russia to "hand over information resources to universal control that threatens the stable existence of democratic states."  Feverish two-, three- and multilateral consultations in a wide variety of formats.  Leading world powers will seriously begin to consider the issue of blocking the Internet on a global scale. <br><br>  <b>9. The ban on posting clips taken on a virtual camera</b> <br>  In May 2026, social networks, starting with ‚ÄúFacebook‚Äù, will adopt rules prohibiting posting clips taken on a virtual camera.  However, it‚Äôs almost impossible to distinguish a movie shot on a virtual camera from a movie taken on a regular camera, so the restrictions will not work.  Moreover, the visitors of the ‚Äúsite with the heavenly IP‚Äù, even without posting videos in social networks, will continue to actively discuss the information downloaded from there. <br><br>  <b>10. The second limitation when using a virtual camera</b> <br>  On May 11, 2026, it turns out that in some cases virtual cameras demonstrate not a complete, but a distorted reality.  If the user views the ‚Äúsite with the heavenly IP‚Äù, then shooting it on a virtual camera shows a blank screen of its monitor.  Thus, by means of observation using a virtual camera, it is impossible to establish exactly what information the original user derives from the ‚Äúsite with the heavenly IP‚Äù.  It is impossible to find out who got acquainted with some information shot on a virtual camera.  In the media, this property will be called "protection from the evil one." <br><br>  <b>11. Prohibition of taking evidence in court</b> <br>  On June 1, 2026, amendments to the Constitution of the Russian Federation, the Civil Code of the Russian Federation, the Criminal Procedure Code of the Russian Federation, the laws ‚ÄúOn Mass Media‚Äù and others providing for all sorts of restrictions when using the information obtained on the ‚Äúcelestial IP site‚Äù will begin to operate in Russia.  Videos recorded on a virtual camera will cease to be accepted as evidence in court.  Justification: distortion of real information (‚Äúprotection from evil‚Äù). <br><br>  <b>12. Technology of identification of people</b> <br>  On June 9, 2026, a new technology will be announced on the ‚ÄúSky IP site‚Äù: broadcasting from a virtual camera to a photo.  Now it is enough to upload a photo to the site to install a virtual camera at the location of the specified person.  The camera is initially set at a distance of about 1.5 meters in the face of the observed.  The number 1,5333333 ... (the exact distance of the initial installation of the virtual camera) will be called ‚Äújump h‚Äù, or simply ‚Äújump‚Äù.  At the initial installation of a virtual camera, geographical coordinates are recorded on the site, so the camera can easily move to a more convenient position. <br><br>  <b>13. Publication of commercials with statesmen</b> <br>  In social networks will begin to lay out massively videos with government officials.  Previously, it was difficult to determine the location of statesmen according to geographical coordinates, but now, from a photograph, it is easy.  Mass requests are of the same type, therefore the videos are also of the same type and, in principle, are no different from movies with ordinary people.  The presence of doubles among statesmen brings some revival. <br><br>  <b>14. About the harmfulness of visiting the "site with the heavenly IP"</b> <br>  On June 14, 2026, the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation will convene an urgent conference, at which it will declare that visiting the ‚Äúwebsite with a heavenly IP‚Äù adversely affects the health of visitors.  For the first time in world practice, the term ‚Äúhypnogramming‚Äù will be used.  A ministry spokesman will officially state that a visit to the ‚Äúsite with a celestial IP‚Äù provokes heart attacks, strokes, high blood pressure, cancer, diarrhea, and a general deterioration of health.  It is recommended to the population to refrain from visiting a resource hazardous to health. <br><br>  <b>15. Technology capture the past</b> <br>  On June 21, 2026, a ‚Äúsite with a heavenly IP‚Äù announces a technology to capture the past.  Now on the virtual camera you can shoot not only the present, but also the past - however, not infinitely.  You can delve into the past at 12:08:34 April 18, 1816.  This time limit will be called the ‚Äúsecond Christmas‚Äù.  Why so, technical explanations and even assumptions are absent, however, for a cultural and psychological shock, one possibility to view events after the ‚Äúsecond Christmas‚Äù is more than enough.  The world will freeze in a daze, then, getting acquainted with the documented events of the past, will start going crazy. <br><br>  <b>16. Law ‚ÄúOn the inadmissibility of the desecration of the past‚Äù</b> <br>  After two days of an information surge, which history has not yet known, the law ‚ÄúOn the Inadmissibility of the Desecration of the Past‚Äù will come into force in Russia as a matter of urgency.  In accordance with it, the publication of information about the past, filmed on a virtual camera, in the absence of documentary (notarized) confirmations will be prohibited.  However, the law does not work: the opportunity to personally see the past is so attractive that it will not stop billions of Internet users. <br><br>  <b>17. Recognition of an external attack on Earth civilization</b> <br>  On June 29, 2026, the UN Emergency Commission will unanimously adopt a communique in which it recognizes the fact of an external information attack on Earth civilization through the creation of a ‚Äúwebsite with a heavenly IP‚Äù.  It will be reported that the party that launched the attack is unknown.  The emergency commission will warn the population of the planet: the data reflected on the ‚Äúwebsite with a heavenly IP‚Äù is falsified with unidentified targets.  If the data is inadvertently true, then they serve as a distraction from falsified data. <br><br>  <b>18. New revolutionary products from the company ¬´Gostar¬ª</b> <br>  In September 2026, Gostar will launch the first product related to the ‚Äúheavenly IP‚Äù on the market: the so-called lifaser.  The program will allow to receive from the "site with the heavenly IP" ready-made information samples for any persons or events.  Connection to the ‚Äúsite with the heavenly IP‚Äù is performed by API, then automatic processing and reduction of the filmed material is performed, and comments are added (at the request of the user: captions or voice-over).  ‚ÄúGostar‚Äù Layfazer will win the crazy recognition of users and will serve as the standard for the new product line.  In just a few months, from a little-known research laboratory, Gostar will turn into a world-renowned corporation.  ‚ÄúGoogle‚Äù and ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù will rush in pursuit, but they will be late: precious time will be lost. <br><br>  <b>19. Lifters and Comparazzi - New Professions</b> <br>  By the end of 2026, mankind will gradually become accustomed to the new reality.  There will be new professions, such as lifackers and komparazzi.  Lifers are historians who investigate the intricate twists and turns of the past through its online viewing.  Komparazzi - journalists and bloggers who specialize in finding meaningful (usually scandalously colored) events that are not found by standard lifazers. <br><br>  <b>20. Emousher - a new way to relax</b> <br>  On February 2, 2027, Gostar Corporation will present a new product for relaxation - the emotionist.  The program will allow you to generate from the past videos with a given emotional coloring and intelligence.  In fine-tuning, in addition to the required emotional coloring, it is necessary to indicate the desired period, language and approximate subject matter.  The intellectual level of the user will be determined by the ‚ÄúGostar‚Äù emohoster on their own, based on the user's previous requests to the lifaser. <br><br>  <b>21. Upyumentori - new art</b> <br>  On the basis of the lifazer, a new art is being created - auxumentory: a selection of documentary shots demonstrating, without captions or voice acting, any supervaluable idea.  Sampling can be carried out on one hero, or on one event, or on one locality, or on one subject ‚Äî while an indispensable sign of amenment is a guessed, but not voiced, overvalued idea.  It is impossible to dispute the materials of the judicial review in the judicial order due to the absence of the author's text and strict documentary materials. <br><br>  <b>22. New state policy in relation to the ‚Äúsite with the heavenly IP‚Äù</b> <br>  The commercial exploitation of the ‚Äúsite with a heavenly IP‚Äù will force the world community to reconsider its attitude to this resource, especially since the ‚Äúsite with a heavenly IP‚Äù still cannot be killed.  The site owner does not show himself and the technology of the virtual camera does not reveal, the process of overwriting the BIOS will remain unknown.  Moreover, a simple technology of broadcasting from a virtual camera to any mirror surface will appear.  In this regard, global governments will take a course to the recognition of the right to the existence of a ‚Äúsite with a heavenly IP‚Äù while ignoring information that is undesirable for itself.  It will be necessary to radically reconsider the tactics of the existence of political and public institutions, especially those in contact with state secrets (which, with the advent of the ‚Äúwebsite with the heavenly IP‚Äù, will become not so secret).  In the Constitution of some countries will be prescribed hutspu. <br><br>  <b>23. Church of Heavenly IP</b> <br>  In 2028, Quebec‚Äôs municipal authorities will register the Church of the Heavenly IP.  According to her teachings, nostro808 is a new incarnation of Christ on Earth, Habr is a forerunner resource, and a ‚Äúwebsite with a heavenly IP‚Äù is a sacred resource, at the moment of its disconnection, Judgment Day will come. <br><br>  <b>24. Disengagement of people in relation to the ‚Äúheavenly IP‚Äù</b> <br>  Public opinion on the new technology will be divided.  Conservatives will consider the "site with the heavenly IP" external - most likely alien - diversion and, pointing out the "protection from the evil one" as an example, will refuse to recognize the "celestial" commercials as true.  These people will continue to live as before, deliberately ignoring information received from the ‚Äúsite with a heavenly IP‚Äù - and, incidentally, only unacceptable for their psychology.  Realists, on the contrary, will consider the information received from the ‚Äúsite with the heavenly IP‚Äù absolutely reliable and will use it, but again as necessary.  After a few years, the differences between conservatives and realists will practically disappear, especially since Gostar life lights (based on sampling and interpretation of data) will be able to treat past events arbitrarily.  The number of people who want to check the correctness of the sample, spending personal time on visiting the ‚Äúsite with the heavenly IP‚Äù directly, will decrease.  Such people will be contemptuously called "greens" - in the sense that they climb wherever they go. <br><br>  <b>25. Future capture technology</b> <br>  On December 23, 2028, a technology to capture the future will be announced on the ‚Äúwebsite with a heavenly IP‚Äù ... <br><br>  On that date, the phantasmagoric vision ebbed away, and I remained in front of a plate of cooled mashed potatoes, stunned by the information that had fallen on me.  Will anyone believe the horrifying prospect that has opened before me or consider it a game of the writer's imagination?  How should I know?!  Anyway, my duty to mankind has been fulfilled: the prophecy is recorded and made public.  I can take a breath and finish the dinner, so unexpectedly and at the wrong time interrupted. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/451380/">https://habr.com/ru/post/451380/</a></p>
