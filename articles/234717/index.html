The update took place at once on all platforms, starting with the most popular desktop and mobile <u>Windows, Android, IOS, MacOS,</u> and ending with <u>Smart TV, Mag250 and Roku.</u>  I would like to say that we have invested our whole soul in it and it turned out more than worthy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9fe/a64/12c/9fea6412ce2f4b5c9b70b375c3529c64.png"><br><br>  <b>ALARM:</b> <i><u>There are a lot of pictures below, as it assumes a review on a new design.</u></i>

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Introduction </h4><br>  It all started a couple of months ago.  We worked on the concept of a new design with one <a href="http://happiness-corp.com/">cool design team</a> , eliminated the wrong options, and set about creating the foundation.  The new design is not just external changes, it is a different structure and a different vision, more convenient and improved. <br><br>  At this stage, the basic version is made, which, from time to time, with each new update, will be replenished with various buns that will make the player more ‚Äúsmart‚Äù, convenient and attractive for the user. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/400/839/ed8/400839ed8c4f4d23acd891105f05c203.PNG"><br><br>  <i>Login authorization screen:</i> <b>BEFORE - AFTER</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bb1/b8e/f4b/bb1b8ef4b0b14c08bef5f1a92c9d579d.PNG"><br><br><h4>  List and EPG </h4><br>  A little about the changes themselves.  First of all, with regard to the screen selection of TV channels and EPG (program guide and archive programs).  Previously, it was two different screens, that is, the user had to click on the program icon to see the EPG.  Now the user clicks on the channel and an EPG appears on the left of the screen, where the program that is currently in progress is highlighted in red. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cad/a05/aa6/cada05aa6b604e64b737ee8a543b28dc.PNG"><br><br>  <i>Old interface, with old EPG structure and channel list</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a32/20e/c4a/a3220ec4ad004c49ac15acba94c3d3aa.PNG"><br><br>  Now, under each channel, it became available to view the progress bar, which shows the duration of the program, which is now on the channel.  Enough convenient thing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ef1/241/eb1/ef1241eb10284f62bcf0c54ac8e2652b.PNG"><br><br>  Well, the last addition on this screen is access to viewing channel information and the ability to add a channel to your favorites by clicking on it, after which the channel will be displayed at the top of the list. <br><br><h4>  Categories </h4><br>  With the old design, the after-start window of the channel categories has gone.  That is, after authorization, it was necessary to select a category, and then the channel itself.  We thought it would be more convenient if this menu appears from behind the screen, and initially, after logging in, the user will see a list of all channels. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/026/c16/e1b/026c16e1ba234820b17e595091bb2c29.PNG"><br><br>  On the mobile device, this list of categories appears on the left side of the slide.  Removed as well, only in the other direction.  Very convenient and intuitive. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d62/5b8/99d/d625b899d7b044bb8ec8cb2466543da9.PNG"><br><br><h4>  Video </h4><br>  Also changes affected the video display screen.  And then there were several important upgrades.  First, the scroll bar used to show the range of the entire archive, that is, about 24 hours.  It is inconvenient, because if the user wants to waste this particular program a couple of minutes ago, then this is definitely quite difficult.  Now the scroll bar shows the time range of the particular program that is currently underway.  It is much more convenient to rewind and search for the necessary moment. <br><br>  Secondly, the name of the channel, the name of the program that the user is watching and the time of its broadcast are shown not in fullscreen.  In the future, right in this screen, the user will be able to choose any channel and program with the help of me. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ed8/259/4eb/ed82594eb8214ae79ec280a6b9cd0904.PNG"><br><br>  As mentioned above, this is only the basic and the simplest version of the player with a new design.  In the future, it will acquire new functionality, for example, video thumbnails and the ‚Äúmetro station‚Äù system when switching between programs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c8f/eb4/9a8/c8feb49a8bb14b209d8a9ee7dc337e34.PNG"><br><br><h4>  Settings </h4><br>  This screen has only undergone external changes.  Nothing more can be said yet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b21/0dd/403/b210dd4034e14fd7871206589e8c7f74.PNG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/427/809/822/427809822b414c0ba86dc7402121f063.PNG"><br><br><h4>  Extra buns </h4><br><h5>  Personal Area </h5><br>  Each user has his own personal account.  Now it is implemented with a minimum of functions.  In the future, it is planned to add a billing system to the player, that is, a payment system for packages, films, etc. Also, the user will be able to communicate with his friends who will use the player. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5a9/14f/a4f/5a914fa4fa5540028a86ac08fa85c5fb.PNG"><br><br><h5>  Video on Demand (VoD) </h5><br>  A separate topic for the IPTV operator is video on demand.  We have created the ability to add various movies, videos and other content that users can buy, watch, rate, comment, and recommend to their friends. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/223/5bb/382/2235bb38239246aab694a8f83faef207.PNG"><br><br>  There is a new screen, which was not in the old design.  This is a screen of information about the film, which he bought and wants to see.  The screen displays various information about the film, it is possible to watch a movie trailer, as well as rate this film.  In the future, it is here that users will be able to leave their comments and share their opinions about any movie. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b95/454/48d/b9545448dc77416fb3a6bf53e73da80f.PNG"><br><br><h4>  Total </h4><br>  What can be said in conclusion: with each new day we are getting closer to our ultimate goal - to create a unique application for viewing absolutely any video content, anywhere in the world, on any device.  Each new problem gives us even more strength and energy, because with its solution we gain invaluable experience, which we are trying to implement in the further development of our product.  We are open to collaboration and to criticism.  Everyone always learns from their mistakes. <br><br><h6>  You can download and try Telebreeze player in our company profile on <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/telebreeze/">Habr√©</a> , as well as on the <a href="http://telebreeze.ru/player">official website</a> .
