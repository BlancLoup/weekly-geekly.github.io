  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Underwater Drones: Student Competition Rules 2017 Robosub</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  ‚ÄúSquid with seaweed‚Äù is not a lettuce, it is a task from the anniversary (20th) international competition on underwater UAVs (AUV, Autonomous uninhabited underwater vehicles).  The organizers creatively beat the 20th anniversary and chose the setting ‚Äú20,000 leagues under the sea‚Äù, so the autonomous underwater robots had to slug in torpedoes with squid, cultivate pearls and rescue the sailors from the whirlpool. <br><br>  RoboSub has been held since 1998 (based on the US Space and Naval Systems Center), and the Singapore AUV challenge since 2013. <br><br>  Russian teams from Vladivostok (FEFU and Moscow State University named after Nevelsky) have won prizes many times.

On the main site you can find information about the right to participate, registration (form and fees), websites, social networks, requirements for a journal article, team presentations and videos, and much more. <br><br><h2>  3 Subject </h2><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bd1/4e8/046/bd14e80465d864c8ba9812f7f6ab9b92.jpg"></div><br>  This year‚Äôs theme is based on Jules Verne <i>‚Äôs 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea</i> (as well as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20,000_Leagues_Under_the_Sea_(1954_film)">1954 Disney film of the</a> same name). <br><br><h2>  4 mission </h2><br>  The main objective of the mission is to demonstrate the autonomy of the AUV while playing the role of Nautilus from <i>‚Äú20,000 leagues under the sea‚Äù</i> .  Orange guide markers help guide the unit to the initial tasks.  Two pingers will send AUV to the remaining two tasks.  The device will need to set off (Set Sail) / sink the ship (Disable a ship) (sensory buoys), move along the channel (pass through an obstacle), cultivate pearls (throw a marker), fight the giant squid (fire torpedoes), collect and classify sea samples (remove object (s)), float (surface), move / release object (s) and rescue sailors from the whirlpool (pull the balls out of the octagon). <br><br><h2>  5 Competition Overview </h2><br><h3>  5.1 Location </h3><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b51/718/ce9/b51718ce97500d406fef8db70ac9e8f1.jpg"></div><br>  The competition will be held <a href="https%253A%252F%252Fen.wikipedia.org%252Fwiki%252FSpace_and_Naval_Warfare_Systems_Center_Pacific%26usg%3DAOvVaw0gUpG5bMyIQEyyuLGQ4w02">at the SSC Pacific TRANSDEC facility</a> .  The large size of the object allows us to divide the area into four sections and carry out missions in each of them.  The mission will take place at a depth of 16 feet (4.9 m).  During the semi-finals, half (competition side, two full sections) will be devoted to semi-final tasks.  The other half (the side for the exercises, two full sections) will be at the disposal of teams wishing to continue grinding their algorithms.  The final will be held using all four sections. <br><br><h3>  5.2 Weight and Size Restrictions </h3><br>  To participate in a RoboSub competition, each unit must comply with the following dimensions: six feet in length, three feet in width, three feet in height (1.83 mx 0.91 mx 0.91 m).  Table 1 shows the bonuses and penalties associated with the weight of the apparatus on land. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/52b/df9/d97/52bdf9d976848437aa7e1c86527371ea.jpg"></div><br>  <i>Table 1. The weight of vehicles on land, bonuses and penalties.</i> <br><br><h3>  5.3 Markers </h3><br>  Each marker must not exceed the following dimensions: 2.0 inches x 2.0 inches x 6 inches (5.1 x 5.1 x 15.2 cm).  The marker should weigh less than 2 pounds (0.91 kg) on ‚Äã‚Äãland.  Exceeding the specified parameters with a marker will result in a penalty of 500 points. Any marker that exceeds these limits by more than 10% will be disqualified. Each marker must have a name, color or team emblem.  Markers will be removed from the arena after each launch.  Although if you lose a marker, you will have a certain amount of time, within reasonable limits, to search for it, still treat the markers as a consumable and take care of them in stock. <br><br><blockquote>  No one is following this requirement.  With us (the team of Moscow State University named after Nevelsky) these were ordinary golf balls, filled with lead. <br>  - Vladislav Bolotov, Moscow State University  Nevelsky </blockquote><br><h3>  5.4 Torpedoes </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ii/q4/l9/iiq4l9elf8ts-8bz9nxjcbykz-q.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Torpedo size, weight, marking and potential "loss" are identical to the rules for markers.  Torpedoes must move at "safe" speed.  A ‚Äúsafe‚Äù speed is one in which a torpedo will not hurt when hit from a close distance into a person under water. <br><br>  Test torpedoes: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8QWoyIdBgNQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h3>  5.5 Pingers (Acoustic Locators) </h3><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/608/982/8d6/6089828d6c6d12e79b4039742a18dad6.png"></div><br>  Pingers will be Bentos ALP-365 models, which allows the user to select a frequency from 25 to 40 kHz in increments of 0.5 kHz.  They will only be set to the whole frequency (25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, or 40).  Pingers in each section will use the same frequency.  For example, two pingers in section A will have the same frequency, and two pingers in section B will have the same frequency (but different from section A).  Four different frequencies will be used: one for each section, at the same time two pingers in the section should not be active, only one. Ping from one section will not conflict with ping in the other - only one pinger will ping at a time, see Figure 1. As shown in Figure 4, the frequencies for the sections will be: A - 30 kHz, B - 40 kHz, C - 25 kHz, D - 35 kHz. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5a9/c6b/334/5a9c6b334f9abf47e91f711b437f7fee.jpg"></div><br>  <i>Figure 1. Pingers for four sections</i> . <br><br><h2>  6 RULES OF COMPETITION </h2><br>  1. The official source of all information regarding the rules, interpretations and updates of information for RoboSub is the home page of <a href="http://www.robosub.org/">www.RoboSub.org</a> <br><br>  2. During the competition, the device must operate autonomously, without control, guidance or communication with a person or any external computer.  The device and any parts associated with the device must be immersed and remain immersed.  Not a single part of it should be located above the surface of the water, nor should anything be attached to the device, remaining above the surface while the device is under water. <br><br>  3. Teams may consist of students, teachers, industrial or government partners.  Interdisciplinary teams are invited.  Representatives from industry, government agencies or universities (as part of the faculty) are involved, but full-time students must be at least 75% of each team.  Participants must be enrolled in their schools as a full-time student in a quarter / semester during the winter and spring to be considered ‚Äústudents.‚Äù  It is expected that students from the team will make a significant contribution to the development of their apparatus. <br><br>  4. Of the team members, only students are eligible for cash rewards. <br><br>  5. One of the team members must be appointed ‚Äúteam captain‚Äù.  The team captain, only the team captain, will speak for the team during the competition. <br><br>  6. No member of the team has the right to enter the arena, regardless of time (this also applies to wading, swimming, diving, using boats and other swimming equipment). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f14/5eb/e78/f145ebe789849356b0e463392ff477b2.jpg"></div><br>  Officials of the organizer of the competition will be engaged in the restoration of lost devices.  Officials of the competition organizer will make all reasonable efforts to restore the lost apparatus, but cannot guarantee the success of this task.  All teams acknowledge that by entering into a competition, they bear the risk of damage or loss of their apparatus.  Judges, officials, the receiving party and the sponsors cannot be held responsible for damage or loss. <br><br>  7. Officials of the organizer of the competition may suspend the competition at any time if they consider it necessary to ensure safety. <br><br>  8. There will be a semi-final round in which most / all teams will participate.  After the semi-final round, the judges convene and count the points.  The judges are authorized to select the teams that will participate in the final.  Teams will be taken to the final round in the ranking order from the semifinal round. <br><br>  9. Depending on the number of participants, in order to be considered for selection in the semifinal round, the apparatus must show that it can dive and pass through the gate during training days (qualification).  The unit, which autonomously passes through the gate, is guaranteed participation in the semifinal round.  If this qualification requirement is necessary, this will be announced. <br><br>  10. After the competition, the judges will sum up.  Competitive rating of teams admitted to the final round will be higher than the teams that did not participate in it. <br><br>  11. Each team will have 20 minutes of competition time.  The first 5 minutes make up <i>the preparation period</i> .  During this time, the machine cannot be in the water.  This is followed immediately by a 15-minute <i>speech period</i> .  This time can be changed depending on the number of participants. <br><br>  12. Preparation period: the device can remain on the crane or be placed on the dock, but not in the water and not touch it.  A team may opt out of a five-minute preparation period and begin a 15-minute <i>speech period</i> .  As soon as <i>the performance period</i> begins, the team loses the remaining time <i>during the preparation period</i> . <br><br>  13. <b>Performance period:</b> when officials of the competition organizer signal the start <i>of the performance period</i> , the team may ask that their apparatus be lowered into the water and released to fulfill the mission.  Only tournament officials can lower and remove the unit.  The time required for the descent and / or retrieval of the apparatus is not taken into account in relation to the 15-minute limit (see: Completion of the voyage and removal of the apparatus).  This is done to prevent unsafe actions in an attempt to speed up the process of descent and retrieval. <br><br>  14. Launch <b>series: a</b> team can perform several launches during <i>the performance period</i> .  After the team re-lowers the machine, all points earned in previous launches are lost. <br><br><blockquote>  It's funny, I kind of read the draft of the missions and it was there that not the last launch was taken, but the best one.  This is actually a significant simplification, because, for example, in 2015 (¬± 1 year), the Singapore team did a dofig of everything, and then decided to restart the mission, for they decided that this was not enough for them and their apparatus, according to the law of meanness, hung and all their accumulated points burned .  As a result, in the standings, we with our three simple missions completed were ahead of them. <br>  - Anton Tolstonogov, FEFU </blockquote><br>  15. <b>Completion of the performance and lifting of the device:</b> at any time while the device is in motion, the team captain can signal the end of the turn and request the removal of the device.  Only officials of the competition organizer can receive the device and return it to the dock.  The countdown time for <i>the performance period</i> stops when the organizer touches the unit to reach it.  The countdown will continue as soon as the unit is safely returned to the docking station, or the team establishes communication with the unit, whichever comes first (i.e. if the team has wireless communication with the submarine, the countdown time continues until the diver returns the submarine to the beginning). <br><br>  16. Once launched, the team can block their current account and use any remaining time to inspect the arena.  Inspection should be done offline.  In contrast to the competitive performance here, time will continue to go when removing the device.  This can be changed depending on the time and number of participants. <br><br>  17. If the unit is experiencing significant interference with equipment, line, cable or diver deployed in support of the competition, the team captain may ask for the time to stop, return the device to the dock and ask the judges to add their best estimate of time used in this to the time. start up to the place of interference.  If the team captain does not make this request in a timely manner (as determined by the technical director or his designated person), this option is lost.  Interference related to competition assignments is not suitable for this option, and the apparatus interfering with this may be disqualified at the discretion of the judges. <br><br>  18. The mission ends when one of the following events occurs: <br><br><ul><li>  The term of the performance period ends. </li><li>  Order of judges on the termination of the mission. </li><li>  The team captain requires the completion of the mission. </li><li>  The apparatus comes to the surface outside the octagon (as determined by the judges, see the ‚ÄúInfringement‚Äù section for more details) </li></ul><br><h3>  6.1 What is expected on the spot </h3><br>  1. The organizers did their best to provide participants with maximum resources at the competition venue, including electricity, test pools, Internet access and practice time in the main pool.  This event is open to the public, so there is a high probability that a potential future employer or sponsor will watch the event. <br><br><blockquote>  It's all very cool, there SpaceX is wandering and a bunch of cool teams, only one BUT - you need to be a US citizen :) <br>  - Anton Tolstonogov, FEFU </blockquote><br>  2. It is expected that ALL teams will be present for ALL competition days.  If your team does not reach the final, it is expected that your team will show your device and will be present in the team tent all the time (ALL teams, All days!) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xt/md/6u/xtmd6um5hs9kzhvkhxvneo1ncs8.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><blockquote>  In fact, this is one of the most difficult parts of the competition - seven days from 7 am to 6 pm under the hot Californian sun, that was another challenge for us. <br>  - Anton Tolstonogov, FEFU </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vh/cn/in/vhcninldf-ekha5fts0c2nhnqls.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  6.2 Electricity </h3><br>  1. The United States uses a 120V 60Hz 15A electrical plug.  Usually there are 3 contacts, two parallel pins (one wider than the other) and an offset semi-circular pin.  The wider pin is zero, the shorter pin is phase, and the third is ground. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/36a/f34/ab6/36af34ab6e4a22770be691062d1f222c.jpg"></div><br><h3>  6.3 Apparatus </h3><br>  1. Each team can enter one or more vehicles into the competition.  Each unit will be physically tested by the judges of the competition.  Judges may disqualify any apparatus that, in their opinion, creates an unreasonable security risk for the receiving entity.  Sponsors and the host organization, their employees and agents, and the organizing committee are not responsible for any damage or damage caused by any apparatus, as well as for any damage or injury caused directly or indirectly by disqualification of the apparatus. <br><br>  2. During qualifying, semi-final or final launch, each unit must operate autonomously.  When performing a mission, communication between the device and any person or computer outside the device is not permitted.  Devices must act solely on their ability to sense and maneuver in the arena using onboard resources.  When performing qualifying, semi-final or final launches, everything that is attached to the device must be inside the device.  Any part that breaks the surface is considered a violation.  During test days and test runs, buoys can be used on the surface for communication. <br><br>  3. The weight of each individual device must be less than the maximum allowable.  Please note that bonus points are awarded to vehicles that are below a certain value, and penalties are awarded to those who exceed it (Table 1).  All devices must comply with the volume described in the section "Weight and size." <br><br>  4. All devices must be powered with batteries.  All batteries must be sealed to reduce the risk of acid or caustic electrolytes (caustic electrolytes).  Do not charge batteries inside sealed containers.  The open circuit voltage of any battery (or battery system) in the device cannot exceed 60V DC.  If the team has any questions or problems, they are advised to contact the technical director. <br><br><blockquote>  With batteries in general it was funny this year.  If we used to use standard batteries for quadcopters, now we have made our own assembly of lithium-polymer batteries consisting of many batteries of 18650 format (or something like that).  And he looked like a shahid's belt ‚Äî it was very dumb to transport across the border.  Although the problems were only on the Russian border - then no one paid much attention, the maximum was checked on the detector of explosives at the Korean airport. <br><br>  In fact, if you properly transport the device across the border (as a property of the university), then this is hell of a bureaucratic red tape. <br>  - Anton Tolstonogov, FEFU </blockquote><br>  5. In the waters of the arena, the device can release only markers or torpedoes using compressed air.  The rest is prohibited. <br><br>  6. For the safety of your team and those around you, charged torpedoes are not allowed in the team‚Äôs tent.  If you need to test your launchers, check them either in the water or in an open area, away from anyone and anything. <br><br><blockquote>  This rule appeared for a reason.  What kind of people in the American team did not think and decided to look into the torpedo compartment when the other was testing the launch of a torpedo.  This self-indulgence ended with a legitimate call for an ambulance, the good is all well over. <br>  - Anton Tolstonogov, FEFU </blockquote><br>  7. To ensure the safety of your device, we require that it be securely attached to a belt or suspension of any type.  Even if the device is light enough to carry, we would not want someone to drop it and break it.  In addition, we need to weigh the device and demand that the device be somehow fixed for measurement.  See the document Using the Submarine for tips and ideas on how to do this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4x/d-/56/4xd-56rlh4xqqvcv7ycyf3ikv9a.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  8. All vehicles must contain a clearly marked switch that allows the diver to quickly and easily use it.  The switch must disconnect the batteries from all motor components and devices on the AUV.  Note that he should not turn off the computer.  When reactivated, the device should return to a safe state (screws should not rotate). <br><br><blockquote>  And earlier, by the way, we chopped the whole system straight with this switch (we simply call it killshvich).  It was really stupid, because every time we waited for the computers to restart and restore the wifi connection, and since the arena was just overloaded with various wifi points, it was very long. <br>  - Anton Tolstonogov, FEFU </blockquote><br>  9. All screws must have covers.  Covers should surround the screws with at least a 2 "(5.1 cm) distance between the rotating screw and the edges of the casing (front and rear). If you have protection against hitting your finger when opening, this distance may be minimal. Commercial engines are rated as it is, if they are covered with shells. <br><br>  10. Devices are not allowed into the water without a proper operating switch and protective covers. <br><br>  11. All vehicles should have a positive buoyancy of at least half a percent (0.5%) of their mass, when disconnected using a switch. <br><br>  12. Officials of the organizer of the competition may suspend the operation of the apparatus at any time, if they deem it necessary for security reasons.  Teams may also be requested to request technical specifications of their apparatus before the start of the competition, in order to identify security problems ahead of time.  The information will be kept secret by the judges until the end of the competition. <br><br>  13. When participating in competitions allowed the use of multiple devices.  Each unit must comply with the safety requirements described above.  Along with these requirements there are some clarifications for several devices: <br><br><ol><li>  The total dry weight of all devices must be less than the maximum weight defined in the rules.  Devices are not obliged to start combined together, and are not obliged to unite at the completion of the launch. <br></li><li>  All devices will be weighed and all bonuses / penalties will be calculated for each device separately. <br></li><li>  Coming out of the dock, each device must pass the test gate before performing the task. <br></li><li>  The team may decide to withdraw one of the devices and return it to the dock.

If the minimum requirements have been met, the remaining time after each run will be recorded and used to calculate the time bonus. For example, after the first launch, the team fulfilled the requirements for a temporary bonus with 10 minutes remaining on the clock. These 10 minutes are used to calculate the time bonus for this launch, regardless of what happens with the next launch.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Tasks Cultivate pearls / Battle with squid, as well as Collect and classify will be marked only by pinger.

In other words, if you use a well-designed finished component, your team does not get points for its good technical design.  You will receive points for selecting a component that, in the opinion of the judges, is well suited to the engineering needs of the device (system engineering). <br><br>  <b>9.4.2 Description of Performance Estimates</b> <br>  <b>Passing through the gate: the</b> judge determines whether the gate has passed satisfactorily. <br><br>  <b>Maintain a fixed course through the gate:</b> Does the submarine move in a ‚Äústraight line‚Äù through the check gate?  It is intended to separate the vehicle that maintains the course, or in some other way does something autonomously, from the vehicle that initially goes at an angle to compensate for its drift.  For example, a device that has a weak sinusoidal movement due to the tuning of the PID controller, but on average supports a course that goes straight through the gate.  Or the apparatus that searches for the gate, finds them and goes through them, drives right through the gate.  An apparatus directed from the gate to compensate for unspecified engines and drift does not pass directly through the gate. <br><br>  <b>Following the ‚ÄúPath‚Äù:</b> how well did the device find and follow the segment? <br><br>  <b>Dock / Ship the Ship (Buoys):</b> partial points are awarded if you are tracking a buoy, but instead of deliberately touching it, you encounter it.  Maximum points are given for touching the red, and then the green buoy, without touching the yellow.  Maximum points are given for the slope of the yellow buoy by at least 10 ¬∞, some points are awarded for the fact that the buoy does not tilt.  Manipulation of only the rope holding the buoys / ship will not be counted for scoring. <br><br>  <b>Channel navigation:</b> did the car go through PVC without touching it?  What percentage of the device passed over the top of the object? <br><br>  "Style" is determined by the slopes of 90 ¬∞.  With each change of orientation by 90 ¬∞ a bonus is added.  The channel starts from ~ 10 feet (3 m) in front of the PVC structure and extends to ~ 10 feet (3 m) after the structure. <br><br>  For example: <br><br><ul><li>  If the device changes direction by 90 ¬∞ and passes through the structure, then 1 * (bonus points) are added to the base account. </li><li>  If the device went through the structure upside down (180 ¬∞ change), then 2 * (bonus points) are added to the base account. </li><li>  If the device is able to rotate 360 ‚Äã‚Äã¬∞, then 4 * (bonus points) (and 8 * for 720 ¬∞!) Are added to the base account. </li></ul><br>  <b>Cultivate pearls: a</b> covered box costs more points than an uncovered box.  Two markers in any box will be counted twice.  Partial points can be obtained if the marker lands near or at the edge of the box. <br><br>  <b>Battle with squid: the</b> torpedo must go through the hole to get maximum points.  Bonus points are given for passing one torpedo through each of the small holes.  Partial points can be awarded if the torpedo touches the yellow border without passing. <br><br>  <b>Ascent to the surface within the octagon: The</b> submarine must be completely in the octagon to get maximum points.  Partially points will be awarded depending on which part is outside the octagon. <br><br>  <b>Capture the object: the</b> object must be captured by the apparatus for maximum points.  Partial points may be awarded for partial capture. <br><br>  <b>Object reset: the</b> object must come off the apparatus in order to get maximum points. <br><br>  Partially awarded points may be awarded at the discretion of the judges for the object remaining on the device. <br><br>  <b>Object on the table classification: the</b> object must remain on the table for maximum points.  Partially points can be obtained if objects land near or fall off the table. <br><br>  <b>Object near the ellipse: the</b> object must be completely within the correct color of the ellipse for maximum points.  Partially points will be awarded depending on how far the object is outside the ellipse. <br><br>  <b>Rescue crew: the</b> ball must be completely out of the octagon to get maximum points.  Partially points will be awarded for a ball that is released, but is still inside the octagon. <br><br>  <b>NEW!</b>  <b>Inter-hardware communication (IVC):</b> when there are several devices in the water, they must exchange data with each other in order to get IVC points (several devices do not have to communicate with each other).  Judges should evaluate communication.  The level of communication and the complexity of behavior resulting from communication is what determines the number of points. <br><br>  <b>Time Bonus:</b> at a minimum, the submarine must touch the buoy, complete the ‚ÄúNavigate through the channel‚Äù task, throw at least one marker into the box (or shoot from one torpedo through the hole) and surface in the octagon to get a time bonus.  These tasks can be performed in any order. <br><br>  Bonus time - the calculation of the remaining whole minutes plus seconds.  For example, with the remaining time of 7:13 the team will receive (7 + 13/60) * 100 = 721.667 points (approximately). <br><br>  Original: <a href="http://www.robonation.org/sites/default/files/RoboSub_2017_Final_Mission_v2_5-2.pdf">www.robonation.org/sites/default/files/RoboSub_2017_Final_Mission_v2_5-2.pdf</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vk/eb/el/vkebelepxjnrterlrketyo15r-o.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Team of organizers</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7v/av/07/7vav077e2ziqsvvhcr_a0ahb1xi.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Vladivostok team</i> <br><br><h3>  PS </h3><br>  <b>Q:</b> Tell me something interesting? <br>  <b>A:</b> Why did we take second place?
