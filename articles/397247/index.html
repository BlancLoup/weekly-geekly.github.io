      By the way, <a href="https://corp.mail.ru/ru/press/releases/9726/">we just figured out</a> how many Russians are not going to buy a new iPhone (spoiler: almost everything).  And they asked Hi-Tech Mail.Ru users to tell them which updates they would like to see on the iPhone 7. You could choose several options, the most votes were given for the increased battery capacity.  The second place is the appearance of protection against water and dust, the third is the renewal of design.  And under the cut, we repeat what is known about the iPhone 7 today. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  After a few hours, Apple will show two new smartphones at once.  Almost all leaks feature iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus.  The names will be just that: the models have already ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù managed to light up on the official Apple website. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ffe/5f7/a0b/ffe5f7a0b4194049a040cf108d5b688d.jpg"><br><br>  One of the possible colors is a deep black with a glossy effect - like the body of an expensive grand piano. <br>  In the new iPhone 7 shooting speed will increase to 60 frames per second.  This will allow creating more interesting videos, as well as improving the quality of shooting dynamic scenes with the participation of children, animals, athletes, etc. <br><br><h1>  Will the headphone jack remain? </h1><br>  The rumor that the new iPhone will not have a headphone jack was replicated very often.  Apple has gone to radical steps before: remember at least about the painful transition from the old thin and wide charging connector to the modern Lightning. <br><br>  It is through him that the headphones will connect to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, if the company decides to change.  The package, obviously, will include a special version of the headphones EarPods with Lightning connector.  You should not count on wireless headphones in the box - it is too expensive. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5dd/92a/f09/5dd92af092ec46bd83f233e80a6431cc.jpg"><br><br>  The quality of insider photos is traditionally low, but some of the information can be considered.  So, the network has a picture of the box, which indicates that the iPhone 7 will include wireless headphones and a Lightning-USB cable, as well as a USB adapter for connecting to a power outlet.  No adapters and old wired headphones for the 3.5 mm jack! <br><br>  In addition, it confirms the 256-gigabyte version of the iPhone 7. So, Apple, most likely, refused to 16-gigabyte smartphones, there will be three versions: 32, 128 and 256 GB. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/01f/655/20a/01f65520a5ab41b09645c7a77a02bf61.jpg"><br>  <sup><i>Leaked photos of iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone 7</i></sup> <br><br>  Reasons for change are significant: without a headphone jack, there is more space for the battery, the size of the smartphone will decrease and the frame around the screen will shrink. <br><br>  The potential drawbacks of the rejection of the audio jack are also serious: regular headphones can only be connected to the new iPhone via an adapter.  This is extremely uncomfortable. <br><br><h1>  In the older model will be two cameras </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5e7/8f9/a08/5e78f9a0811147b0939cf4c55083dc49.jpg"><br><br>  Hi-Tech Mail.Ru conducted blind tests, according to which the cameras of Apple smartphones have not been the best in the class for a long time: only Samsung and Huawei‚Äôs flagships noticeably outperform them in quality.  It is logical that it is time to upgrade. <br><br>  If you believe the rumors, the iPhone 7 Plus will get a dual 12-megapixel camera.  And this perspective is much more realistic than the rejection of audiojack: there are plenty of photos on the web. <br><br>  How exactly this camera will work is not yet clear.  But the matter is unlikely to be limited to the simple opportunity to change the focus point after shooting, as was the case with HTC: a weak and dubious advantage.  We are waiting for at least a wide angle like the LG G5 (only without losing quality) or expanding the dynamic range like the Huawei P9 / P9 Plus. <br><br>  But in the iPhone 7 dual cameras will not be: this, again, indicate numerous leaks.  But, most likely, optical image stabilization will appear. <br><br><h1>  What else? </h1><br>  Absolutely new iPhones will receive an Apple A10 processor, which will be in both iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus.  The chipset has two processing cores, but the frequency is not yet known exactly.  It is assumed that this is 2.45 GHz.  In the older model will be 3 GB of RAM, and in the younger - 2. <br><br>  However, Tim Cook is unlikely to talk about this from the scene.  Instead, it will simply show a couple of new spectacular games and tell you that the new ‚ÄúiPhones‚Äù are the most powerful in the world and never slow down at all. <br><br>  However, very soon we will stop guessing at the tea leaves and leakage, and finally we will see everything with our own eyes. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/397247/">https://habr.com/ru/post/397247/</a></p>
