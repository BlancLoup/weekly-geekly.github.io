  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Just</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the life of each programmer, the moment comes when he becomes independent.  A person grows from a child programmer into an adult programmer.  This moment is especially characterized by the fact that the programmer is able to find the answers to his questions himself, rather than asking him to sit in ten forums and wait for an answer.  As an example, I can give the <a href="http://phpclub.ru/talk/forumdisplay.php%3Fs%3D%26forumid%3D12">"sense" of the PCP club</a> .  In the future, the fate of the programmer can develop in different ways, but the main ones can be distinguished as follows (in order of worsening professionalism): <br><br>  1) the programmer calmly writes the things he needs, looking for manuals at the same time, and only rarely looks at forums like ‚Äúphp club‚Äù and does not bother with the others.  Such a programmer himself is looking for an adventure.  And finds.  And it achieves a lot.  This is a guru. <br><br>  2) the programmer also quietly writes the code, but doesn‚Äôt really strive to become a guru, but grows as he gains experience, which he throws in his superiors.  Such people sometimes appear on forums in their free time, but answer mainly questions only on their working topics or personal experience.  These usually do not understand small topics or topics that do not concern them.  These are professionals.

      2b) as a supplement to level 2, similar to the programmer (3b) but already trained in manuals and having a lot of experience, still out of habit habits of others.  Such a programmer considers his words to be true in the first instance, although he does not admit it.  A dispute with him on the forum is likely to end with a ban to someone who argued with him. <br><br>  3) a mid-level programmer.  He writes good code, but has some minor problems in his work (either the logic is not normal, or he misses a lot of things, which later returns to him in the form of bugs from QA).  Already know how to use the manual, but still <br><br>  3b) a programmer, of the same level, but who imagines too much about himself.  He sticks out all the time on the forums, where he constantly gives advice and reproaches the rest. <br><br>  5) nooby (noobie).  Manuals rarely reads.  He likes to ask a lot and think little.  He constantly demands from others to explain or show something to him.  Argues.  The code is bad, does not have a used style. <br><br>  6) a novice programmer who either understood himself, or has a patron of level 1-2, but who reads manuals and asks only what he does not understand, from experience and what he is not yet given to figure out on his own.  She does not have her own style, but she tries to debug and correct errors on her own. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/18134/">https://habr.com/ru/post/18134/</a></p>
