I apologize in advance for the huge amounts of legislative text, as I will cite interesting passages in the form of quotations.  So that dear readers would not make it difficult for themselves to search for the bill in the Consultant. <br><br>  The preamble of the project is normal.  It is about making changes and amendments to the federal law N 149- ‚ÄúOn information, information technologies and on information protection‚Äù. <br>  Then you can skip if you are too lazy to absorb bureaucratic speech.  But better get a grasp, otherwise it will be too late.  The State Duma is "not a place for discussion", so, most likely, the law is waiting for us the same as its draft. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So:

The result of the identification and authentication of a person using information technology tools may be confirmed by an electronic document provided by means of an information system providing remote identification and authentication of a person.  Cases where such confirmation is mandatory shall be determined by the Government of the Russian Federation. ‚Äù <br><br>  Article 2 <br><br>  In the Federal Law ‚ÄúOn Personal Data‚Äù (Collection of Legislation of the Russian Federation, 2006, N 31, Art. 3451): <br><br>  1) In clause 5 of part 1 of article 6, the words ‚Äúexecution of the contract‚Äù shall be replaced by the words ‚Äúexecution of the transaction‚Äù;  the words ‚Äúand also for the conclusion of the contract‚Äù shall be replaced by the words ‚Äúto complete the transaction‚Äù;  the words ‚Äúor agreements‚Äù shall be replaced by the words ‚Äúor transactions‚Äù;  add the following with the text ", as well as for negotiating the relevant transaction"; <br><br>  2) Article 9 shall be supplemented with clause 5.1 as follows: <br>  "5.1 When processing personal data using the digital profile infrastructure, if the subject of personal data requires consent to the processing of personal data, the subject of personal data consents to their processing in the digital profile infrastructure in the form of an electronic document signed by an enhanced qualified electronic signature (my your own comment) or by a simple electronic signature, the key of which was obtained at a personal appearance in accordance with the rules for using simple  electronic signature when applying for the receipt of state and municipal services in electronic form, established by the Government of the Russian Federation.  The withdrawal of such consent is carried out by the subject of personal data in the infrastructure of a digital profile. "; <br><br>  Now a few of my arguments on everything copied. <br><br>  First of all, it pleases the fact of the emergence of such bills.  The amount of information that is concentrated in the hands of the state and corporations is rapidly growing and is gradually moving into a new quality that allows you to control the masses of people at a new level.  And they won't even notice.  And here, of course, prescribing at least some algorithms of access to the digital profile of a citizen by the state, corporations and OTHER (other and how to define) organizations is wonderful.  Apparently, in the ‚Äúbrave new world‚Äù access to digital profiles will be the main authority and the main source of money. <br><br>  Once the colonialists in the colonies simply stupidly robbed and confiscated everything, then the colonial‚Äôs unrestricted access to the sales markets became a sign of the colony, and now it‚Äôs a matter of the fact that the colony is a country, all digital data and profiles of which are available for processing and analyzing then by.  People will perform in their cozy smartphone and desktop realities only those actions that are beneficial to large foreign uncles.  Russia still has hope that the "big uncles" will at least be ours.  I would very much like to see in the law the order of access to digital profiles of citizens, but somehow it becomes uncomfortable to live. <br><br>  But it is necessary to write more about authentication technologies directly in the law.  That is, they have given their consent to the processing of personal data using enhanced EDS, and this is excellent.  But in my opinion, and ‚Äúidentification, authentication of a person‚Äù should be prescribed by law about the use of EDS.  Nothing more secure than iron gizmo plus the password from the head has not yet been invented.  And the fact that they did not indicate this opens up scope for any ungodly type of face authentication through face recognition. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/450048/">https://habr.com/ru/post/450048/</a></p>
