Weekend, good sunny weather, event. <br>  <b>"ABOUT!</b>  <b>Come on! ‚Äù- we thought and advanced.</b>

    <a name="habracut"></a>  There was a line near the main entrance to the island.  30 minutes - checked for the presence of food and water.  With her - they did not let her in, as promised, they asked to be left at the entrance.  We managed to carry nuts (as it turned out later - not in vain), forgive us personal karma. <br>  People came on mopeds, bicycles and walked.  Arriving and arriving ... <br><br><img src="http://kseniaartemenko.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  Event Location: </h5><br>  By the way, New Holland is not very much and the island is a fenced separate territory.  On three sides - buildings, on the fourth - a fence and a small moat.  This territory was closed for 300 years, and the Nedano discovered it.  Now for the comfort of the guests on the island organized a huge green lawn with playgrounds for beach volleyball and football, active games, planted a vegetable garden and set up a shop with village products. <br><br>  Once on the island, we looked around: there were small containers: bright, colorful, with grass on the roof. <br>  First of all, we went to look at robots and nanotechnologies running in green lawns in action.  But we saw geeks active and geeks having a rest. <br><br><img src="http://kseniaartemenko.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://kseniaartemenko.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And then there was a vegetable garden and a grocery store at space prices. <br>  Separate attention - to the garden, with miniseries, scarecrow and signs. <br>  As we understood, this is some kind of competition between projects with Loft Floors and Pies: who will most likely grow radish and will thicken potatoes:) <br><br><img src="http://kseniaartemenko.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  About the program of the event: </h5><br>  Having walked and rested, we decided to listen to educational programs.  Although not many programs were announced, all were interesting, and we had time to start at the beginning (it was assumed that the programs would take an hour).  However, it was not possible to fully listen: simply because it was not clear when exactly which report would be held. <br><br>  The only people they saw and listened to were Yandex representatives, with a story about the airship.  And then venture investors and startups went.  I didn‚Äôt hear the alphabank ones I wanted, although they really wanted to. <br>  As a result, we listened to one and a half of the report, without understanding when it would be a continuation, and whether it would be at all, went to look for robots. <br><br><h5>  [Nanotechnology] </h5><br>  Robots - were.  In small quantities, not running around on the grass, with business cards of the creators.  And one creator (I apologize if not accurate). <br><br><img src="http://kseniaartemenko.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/060820111039.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://kseniaartemenko.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/060820111040.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://kseniaartemenko.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/060820111022.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  Cookies </h5><br>  A separate topic deserves food.  Or rather, its absence in the public domain.  Generally the food was.  Through the queue for 30 minutes, at least in a small cafe, under the symbolic name "Food". <br><br><img src="http://kseniaartemenko.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/060820111025.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  About free access to food resources: no cookies, no coffee, no water.  And at the entrance they asked to leave everything. <br>  In general, a small bobble came out - there were clearly more people than expected. <br><br>  <b>The thought ‚Äúbut we did not come here to eat‚Äù helped.</b> <br><br><h5>  Fun </h5><br>  We went on a picnic to chat and look at inventions.  And they were. <br><br>  <b>We were pleased with the unusual stilts</b> who tried on those who wished: <br><br><img src="http://kseniaartemenko.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/060820111037.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://kseniaartemenko.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/060820111036.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/comElLhR5go%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjhEFMuLd_hRKTZTH_o4XMrud26CA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>There were also unicycle</b> , which with little difficulty mastered active guests: <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/bCaoueggRAk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgaXLDZUKg_VEJYK1Iv1uF3Lltgfg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>There was an interesting zone - a musical platform</b> with sensors that respond to movement. <br><br>  Dancing man - the organizer of Geek Picnic'a - Yura Livshits:) Positive energetic and constant man running from one platform to the other. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/j9-C9gQ9N_k%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgoWlFpU0ng6I5DjGafAeHHZFq97g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h5>  Impressions </h5><br>  In general, we stared down and thinned, we decided not to stay on the evening bonfire.
