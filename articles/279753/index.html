    <hr><br>  <b>Sergey Pirogov.</b>  <b>Automation of functional testing of Web applications</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/90e/e82/3d9/90ee823d998c443385af69f17beec7a8.jpg" align="left" height="150">  My name is Sergey, my main specialization is the automation of functional testing of Web applications.  I mainly deal with the automation of testing UI parts of web applications and the level of web services.  He worked on various projects: risk management systems, trading platforms for large banks and eCommerce solutions for large trading platforms.  I mainly develop it in Java, but my circle of interests does not end there.  In my free time I study Groovy.  During his work he used various approaches in test automation and building frameworks for writing tests.  I have extensive experience with BDD tools such as JBehave, Cucumber.  I have experience in implementing test automation on a project from scratch, as well as optimizing and improving projects with ready automation.  Have experience in mentoring and managing a team of 1 to 6 people.  According to the wards, was recognized as the best mentor.  I act as a mentor and lecturer at various events.  Served as a speaker at QAFest 2015. <br><br>  In general, the report focuses on the use of Groovy for test automation purposes.  It is based on personal experience with Groovy and successful implementation and transition to writing tests using this language.  The goal is to show students the possibilities of the language, with which you can write simple and easily supported tests.  I will show examples and specific libraries for working with the database, REST API and UI.  The description will include tools and libraries that were written independently, for example, GroovyObject or SoftAssert. <br><br><hr><br>  <b>Evgeny Ogorodnikov.</b>  <b>Deploy test automation from scratch - tips from personal experience</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/78a/da5/df3/78ada5df3d0b4108bc2636fd49c891a8.jpg" align="left" height="150">  IT specialist with ~ 8 years of experience in various roles: engineer, programmer, tester, testing manager.  Twice he created testing from scratch, in particular - automation, now in the process of deploying processes in the third.  I develop, test and support high-load projects mainly in Agile teams. <br><br>  In my report, I will talk about the choice of test automation strategy, the definition of tasks and approaches to the automation process.  Test plan, test cases and criteria for the selection of suitable tests, assessment of the effectiveness and time of task execution <br><br><hr><br>  <b>Catherine Bobrova.</b>  <b>Representation of the subject area in autotests</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c57/ae0/0ca/c57ae00ca38e4428870dc8cb6fe465ee.jpg" align="left" height="150">  Lead testing engineer, mainly working on backend projects and projects with a complex structure.  I am engaged in the development of test documentation, writing and support of autotests, CI, manual testing, training of trainees.  She worked on projects with test automation for the frontend, backend and API, mainly in Java.  Depending on the needs of the project, these were system, integration or unit tests.  Most often I developed tests from scratch, there was also support and development of someone else's test suite. <br><br>  During my work on a variety of projects with test automation, I was able to ensure that the success of automation always affects the convenience of organizing test code.  Moreover, one and that code architecture can be convenient in various situations.  In the report I will talk about the approach that I like the most.  The main part will be devoted to methods of storing test data depending on the complexity of the business logic being tested. <br><br><hr><br>  <b>Sergey Makhetov.</b>  <b>Test automation in Scala</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/777/887/d41/777887d41d384f95920ec4400ebe3248.jpg" align="left" height="150">  Lead Tester  Leading specialist in testing the company Information Technology Center.  Specializes in testing integration tires for the organization of intradepartmental, interdepartmental, as well as for interstate electronic interaction, including in terms of safety, resiliency and performance. <br><br>  The report will discuss the use of the Scala language in conjunction with the Scalatest, Specs2, Gatling test frameworks to automate the functional and load testing of applications. <br><br><hr><br>  <b>Dmitry Akmaev DINO Systems - global CI, what it is and what is missing in the classic CI</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c33/9c2/149/c339c214999e4ad59f467e7b67a9aa9e.jpg" align="left" height="150">  Currently, I manage and develop the Global Continues Integration project. I have been doing testing for 12 years.  He worked in companies: Quest Software (Dell), I-Free, since 2011 I have been working at Dino Systems (DINS).  I had to use almost all methods of testing, including research, performance testing, and even mutational.  Not without the creation of its Frameworks. <br><br>  In my report, I will consistently tell you: about the background to the emergence of global CI (a huge connected system of more than 170 component types, the presence of Legacy code, simultaneous development in 4 countries, complex integration), the testing problems that arise (full test infrastructure is too cumbersome , updating takes a long time, auto-tests using different approaches and different programming languages, duplication of checks by different teams) and about ways to solve all the problems listed. <br><br><hr><br>  <b>Alexey Lavrenyuk.</b>  <b>Methods and tools for load testing</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/305/14b/625/30514b625b84477b8165e9f0571155a5.jpg" align="left" height="150">  He started as a system administrator 10 years ago.  Then, for about a year, he loaded services of banks and telecom, working in the integrator.  In Yandex for 4 years, engaged in load testing, developing tools and experiments in the field of performance.  Leads open-source projects <a href="https://github.com/yandex/yandex-tank">Yandex.Tank</a> and <a href="https://github.com/yandex/pandora">Pandora</a> . <br><br>  I will talk about the load testing methodology and our tools: <br><ul><li>  What tests need to be carried out to test the load typical service? </li><li>  How to configure Yandex.Tank to conduct these tests? </li><li>  How to present the test results and how to look at them? </li><li>  What tools do we use to automate load tests and analyze their results? </li></ul><br><br><hr><br>  <b>Alexander Chumakin.</b>  <b>Automation of integration systems interaction and load testing scenarios</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/270/a30/224/270a302249204d2a817f01b25521fd2e.jpg" align="left" height="150">  For a long time, he was a technical leader of a team of 10 people and the main developer of a framework for test automation, mainly based on technologies such as Webdriver, SpecFlow, AutoIt, Sikuli.  One run of all tests on one browser took about 7 full days, after which most of the preparatory scenarios were transferred to work through WCF services, which reduced the run time to three days.  Another major project is to highlight the work in the Scrum team, where from scratch I designed automation for the Big-data project, including API Rest and Web testing, load scripts, full back-end functionality, including automatic testing of integrations with other applications. <br><br>  In my report, I will talk about back-end testing (tools, technologies, and actual use), end-to-end application integration testing, back-end load testing and UI (tools, platforms for running, reports), load testing automation, a brief review of big-data technology. <br><br><hr><br>  <b>Mikhail Bobkov.</b>  <b>Test automation on integration projects</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c4f/ec8/a2e/c4fec8a2eb9344998948330c96bdfb43.jpg" align="left" height="150">  I fulfill the role of an architect on integration projects.  The last few years working on one of the largest integration projects UBS.  I am the inspirer and architect of the system to automate the testing of integration projects <br><br>  Integration solutions are created to connect systems with each other.  One of the problems in testing on such projects is that it is not always possible to use real systems.  A way is needed to replace these systems with plugs, but integration scenarios are complex and the behavior changes depending on the data.  In this training will be given an introduction to the integration for students who are not familiar with this direction.  The report will highlight the main problems of testing integration solutions and how we solved these problems at Neoflex.  There will also be provided a comparative analysis of technologies that has been considered for making decisions about creating a system.  And the system itself is presented <br><hr><br><br><h1>  When and where? </h1><br>  Registration links: <br><ul><li>  We have an <a href="http://qaconf.ru/">excellent site</a> where you can read about all the speakers, and about all the reports.
