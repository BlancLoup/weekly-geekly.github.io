To the second reading in the text of the document proposed to make changes.  So, one of them will be a complete ban on the ownership of critical infrastructure by foreign companies, <a href="http://izvestia.ru/news/660084">according</a> to Izvestia.  The initiator of the possible ban is the relevant committee of the State Duma on information policy, information technology and communications under the leadership of Leonid Levin.  It was he who proposed to discuss the introduction of ‚Äúrestrictions for owners and users of critical information infrastructure facilities‚Äù. <br><br>  From the conclusion of the committee it follows that the amendments will include companies with foreign participation or affiliated with foreign states, international and non-governmental organizations.  At the same time, the committee claims that ignoring this issue can lead to threats to the information and national security of the Russian Federation. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  According to the text of the draft law, the critical infrastructure includes information and telecommunication systems in:

All significant objects are proposed to be included in the next special registry. <br><br>  With these amendments, officials want to achieve the opening of legal representative offices of companies with access to critical infrastructure in the territory of the Russian Federation.  This is done in order to increase the transparency of their activities, to collect taxes and to have ‚Äúon hand‚Äù top officials who could be held accountable. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe believe that companies that own or dispose of critical infrastructure should be legal entities in Russia,‚Äù Leonid Levin, head of the State Duma‚Äôs IT Committee, told Izvestia. <br><br>  But there is a negative side to this approach.  For example, telecom operators recognize that part of the infrastructure, which they want to recognize as critical, was created by foreign companies on their order.  Moreover, its maintenance is also performed by its creators on the principle of outsourcing. <br><br>  ‚ÄúForeign manufacturers have taken care of themselves.  Like, why do you have to suffer with what you have no competencies, we have developed this system.  Therefore, it is important how the new requirements will be formulated and how to monitor their implementation, ‚Äùsaid one of the publication‚Äôs interlocutors. <br><br>  In its current form, and with the current wording, foreign manufacturers will have to open legal offices in the country to serve the Russian systems and comply with the new law.  As is known, many companies prefer to work from abroad as foreign organizations. <br><br>  If the amendments are adopted in the second reading in its current form, this may lead to another round of expensive ‚Äúimport substitution‚Äù (subject to the availability of similar systems), or a conflict between business and officials, which is <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/284916/">already observed</a> around the implementation of the Yarovaya-Ozerova law package. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/373105/">https://habr.com/ru/post/373105/</a></p>
