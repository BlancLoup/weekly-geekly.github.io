The point is clearly not only in the plots of the works, not only in <em>what</em> is written, but also in what <em>is</em> written.  But with fast reading diagonally, it is difficult to realize.  In addition, the text of some significant novel simply has nothing to compare with us: why, in fact, is it so wonderful that this particular word appeared in this place, and why is it better than some other?  To some extent, real word usage could contrast the potential that can be found in the drafts of the writer.  The writer does not immediately write his text with inspiration from the beginning to the end; he suffers, chooses between options, those that seem to him insufficiently expressive, he crosses out and searches for new ones.  But drafts are not for all texts, they are fragmentary and difficult to read.  However, it is possible to conduct such an experiment: replace all replaceable words with similar ones, and read the classic text in parallel with the one that has never existed, but which could have appeared in some parallel universe.  Along the way, we can try to answer the question why this word in this context is better than another, similar to it, but still different. </p><br><p>  And now all this (except for the actual reading) can be done automatically. <a name="habracut"></a></p><br><h2 id="distributivnaya-semantika-aka-vektornye-modeli">  Distribution semantics aka vector models </h2><br><p>  Habr√© already had <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/275913/">an article</a> on how to use distributive semantics in searching for so-called.  "Pies".  Distributive semantics is a fairly simple but perfectly working idea that the meaning of a word is related to its surroundings in the text.  Words with a similar meaning will appear in similar contexts and vice versa.  The context itself can be represented as a vector (hence the "vector models") and calculate the similarities and differences in the meaning of different words.  For the Russian language, on the basis of this idea, an excellent service was made - <a href="http://rusvectores.org/">RusVect≈çrƒìs</a> , which not only allows you to find the most semantically similar words, but also provides for free access the models considered by the creators of the resource. </p><br><h2 id="processing">  Processing </h2><br><p>  Take 5 classic Russian novels.  Dmitry Bykov said somewhere that the most significant for Russian literature are novels, in the names of which there is a union "and".  It means: ‚ÄúCrime and Punishment‚Äù, ‚ÄúWar and Peace‚Äù, ‚ÄúFathers and Sons‚Äù, ‚ÄúMaster and Margarita‚Äù.  Well, "Eugene Onegin", also an important Russian novel, albeit in verse. </p><br><p>  In addition, we will need a model from the RusVect≈çrƒìs website, which is built on the texts of the <a href="http://ruscorpora.ru/">National Corps of the Russian language</a> and Russian Wikipedia.  The <a href="https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/word2vec.html">Gensim</a> library will allow us to work with it.  To search in this model so-called.  <em>quasi-synonyms</em> , that is, in fact, the nearest neighbors of the semantic graph (and these neighbors are not always ‚Äúreal‚Äù synonyms, often the most semantically close word is the antonym, although it seems counterintuitive), we will need a normalized form of the word (lemma), which the morphological analyzer should help , the program is able to find this form.  At first I thought of using <a href="https://tech.yandex.ru/mystem/">Mystem</a> from Yandex, but in the end I stopped at another, <a href="https://github.com/kmike/pymorphy2">Pymorphy2</a> , then it will be clear why. </p><br><pre><code class="python hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span></span> gensim <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span></span> pymorphy2 model = gensim.models.KeyedVectors.load_word2vec_format(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"ruwikiruscorpora_0_300_20.bin.gz"</span></span>, binary=<span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">True</span></span>) model.init_sims(replace=<span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">True</span></span>) morph = pymorphy2.MorphAnalyzer()</code> </pre> <br><p>  So, go through the text, take words from it, normalize (that is, restore the infinitive for verbs or the nominative singular for names), look for the most similar word in the model, and make sure that this word is the same part of speech , as the original, because by default it will not necessarily be so.  See, for example, the closest words to <a href="http://rusvectores.org/ru/similar/">blue</a> : there are the same nouns <em>blueness</em> , <em>blackness</em> , but there is a <em>blue</em> adjective and a <em>blue</em> verb.  I'm not talking about the fact that there are no words in the model at all.  The fact is that for low-frequency words, the vector is not constructed for optimization reasons in the original body of words, and the quasi-synonym cannot be found.  So, we leave in this place the original word.  In addition, it makes no sense to look for substitutes for pronouns, prepositions, and other incomplete parts of speech. </p><br><h2 id="generaciya-form">  Form generation </h2><br><p>  But then the most interesting.  In the source text, the word stands in some indirect form, and from the model we obtained a lemma.  Now it needs to be put in the same form so that the text is coherent and readable, and does not seem like some kind of bad translation from an alien type <em>Mom to wash the frame</em> .  And this is exactly what the Pymorphy2 can help us, who can not only make out words, but also put them in the right shape according to given signs.  Mystem cannot do this, and if, when parsing, to memorize not only the lemma that the analyzer issued, but also a set of signs of the form of a word (the same number and case), then it will be very convenient to send them back to the same program to generate the form.  True, it turned out that not all the tags that the Pymorphy2 analyzer generates know the Pymorphy2 generator, that is, its right hand does not always know what the left hand is doing.  But it's not scary, a little dancing with a tambourine and we get the desired shape: </p><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">The function in which the author is dancing with a tambourine around Pymorphy2</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><pre> <code class="python hljs"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">def</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"> </span><span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">flection</span></span></span><span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">(lex_neighb, tags)</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function">:</span></span> tags = str(tags) tags = re.sub(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">',[AGQSPMa-z-]+?

Voila!  Alternative Russian literature, which was not, on our screen: </p><br><p>  Talk about Juvenile <br>  In the middle of the note leave vale, <br>  Yes, I remembered, though not without a sin <br>  From the Aeneid two poems. </p><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">For those who have forgotten that there really</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><p>  Talk about Juvenile, <br>  At the end of the letter put vale, <br>  Yes, he remembered, though not without sin, <br>  From the Aeneid two verses. </p></div></div><br><p>  But still something is not right.  In some places, the text still exceeds the permissible degree of incoherence: </p><br><p>  Friends of Lyudmila and Ruslana! <br>  With the heroine of my story <br>  Without epilogues, sow half an hour <br>  Let me meet you </p><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">If you want to look at the original and touch the beautiful</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><p>  Friends of Ludmila and Ruslana! <br>  With the hero of my novel <br>  Without prefaces, this time <br>  Let me introduce you </p></div></div><br><p>  It is a matter of nouns!  From the model we get the same part of speech and put it in the same form, but we did not take into account such a constant feature of nouns as gender.  It is different for different nouns, and the correct generation of the form will not save from inconsistency.  Now we introduce the rule according to which the nouns that the model has given us, still additionally check for gender: </p><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">More dances with a tambourine</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><pre> <code class="python hljs"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">def</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"> </span><span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">flection</span></span></span><span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">(lex_neighb, tags)</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function">:</span></span> tags = str(tags) tags = re.sub(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">',[AGQSPMa-z-]+?

It is necessary to select words, taking into account other grammatical categories, among which transitivity and voice are suggested.  Well, pymorphy2 is not perfect in choosing a lemma.  He suggests the most likely.  But the most likely answer is not always the right one.  For example, the <em>young</em> form is recognized as a genitive from a noun <em>young</em> , the most similar to it is a <em>dark-skinned woman</em> , and pymorphy2 happily places the dark-haired woman in the form of a genitive case.  This is how a <em>whitish young man</em> turns out to have a <em>blond haired mind</em> . </p><br><p>  In some places it is better to define the form with the letter <em>e</em> , which is usually not reproduced in the texts of novels: </p><br><pre> <code class="python hljs"><span class="hljs-meta"><span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span></span>morph.parse(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">''</span></span>) [Parse(word=<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">''</span></span>, tag=OpencorporaTag(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'NOUN,inan,femn plur,gent'</span></span>), normal_form=<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">''</span></span>, score=<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0.588235</span></span>, methods_stack=((&lt;DictionaryAnalyzer&gt;, <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">''</span></span>, <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">55</span></span>, <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">8</span></span>),)), Parse(word=<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">''</span></span>, tag=OpencorporaTag(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'NOUN,anim,masc sing,nomn'</span></span>), normal_form=<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">''</span></span>, score=<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0.411764</span></span>, methods_stack=((&lt;DictionaryAnalyzer&gt;, <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">''</span></span>, <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">3019</span></span>, <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0</span></span>),))] &gt;&gt;&gt; morph.parse(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">''</span></span>) [Parse(word=<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">''</span></span>, tag=OpencorporaTag(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'NOUN,anim,masc sing,nomn'</span></span>), normal_form=<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">''</span></span>, score=<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1.0</span></span>, methods_stack=((&lt;DictionaryAnalyzer&gt;, <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">''</span></span>, <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">3019</span></span>, <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0</span></span>),))]</code> </pre> <br><p>  Therefore: </p><br><p>  To laugh and think about yourself: <br>  When will the <em>features</em> take you! ‚Äù </p><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">instead</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><p>  Sigh and think about yourself: <br>  When the devil take you! </p></div></div><br><p>  Description of the idea of ‚Äã‚Äã"vector novels" and additional materials are <a href="https://nevmenandr.github.io/novel2vec/">on a special page</a> . </p><br><p>  All replacement code is laid out on <a href="https://github.com/nevmenandr/word2vec-russian-novels">Github</a> . </p><br><p>  Enjoy reading! </p><br><h2 id="ssylki">  Links </h2><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://rusvectores.org/">RusVect≈çrƒìs</a> , specifically <a href="">link</a> to the model used (420 MB). </li><li>  <a href="https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/word2vec.html">Gensim</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://github.com/kmike/pymorphy2">Pymorphy2</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://github.com/arnicas/word2vec-pride-vis">Replacing words with similar ones in Pride and Prejudice</a> (there are no problems with morphology) </li></ul><br><p>  UPD .: <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/kdenisk/" class="user_link">kdenisk</a> provided the authorized texts of the novels, which made it possible to get rid of a number of flaws in the recognition of forms.
