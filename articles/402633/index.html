You can‚Äôt play games on the embedded video in particular, but in office PCs and the so-called HTPC, these chips look great.  However, sporting interest is sporting interest.  We checked what modern iGPU are capable of in games in Full HD resolution, and at the same time we studied the dependence of frame growth per second on the RAM frequency. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e9a/56f/5a5/e9a56f5a5ec64d74934f296badb97a67.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The choice of resolution is quite obvious.  Still, less than 1920x1080 pixels can be safely considered yesterday.  Anything less than 1280x720 is the day before yesterday.  Thus, more than 43% of Steam client users use displays with this resolution - whether it is a desktop, laptop, or system unit connected to a TV.  In 2017, it‚Äôs fit to talk about the 4K era - at every step they only talk about this format - so we will not give any relief to the integrated GPU.  Full HD and full stop! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/11f/3de/796/11f3de7961af4d45945a2f83b90430e5.png">

    <h3>  What chip makers spend half of the transistor budget </h3><br>  Fast enough, such a component as iGPU, became a permanent attribute of most CPUs.  The graphics processor built into the processor first appeared in Cyrix MediaGX chips in 1997, but the full-scale procession began 13 years later.  In 2010, Intel introduced the first generation of desktop core processors - Clarkdale chips.  Then two chips were located on one textolite substrate at once: HD Graphics was one of them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8f2/2cc/95d/8f22cc95da744004a2aabb6fc1995023.jpg"><br><br>  Already in the generation of processors Sandy Bridge iGPU "settled" along with the computing part, cache and controllers in a single chip.  Now integrated graphics CPU quietly takes up half the useful area of ‚Äã‚Äãsilicon.  And the thinner the technical process by which a particular chip is produced, the more the transistor budget is allocated for the needs of iGPU. <br><br>  In January, Intel introduced the seventh generation Core chips, using iGPU HD Graphics 630 and 610. They are far from the fastest graphics clusters.  In our opinion, the most powerful integrated video core is equipped with a Core i7-6770HQ (Skylake) processor.  It is equipped with Iris Pro 580 graphics and an additional 128 MB of eDRAM memory (it is also called fourth-level cache).  This iGPU immediately has 72 execution units that operate at a frequency of 950 MHz.  HD Graphics 630 has only 24 execution units.  The only problem with the Core i7-6770HQ is that it is not a desktop processor, that is, it does not exist in the LGA version. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/141/37c/d25/14137cd25cf340aab32b72ffc5177b15.jpg"><br><br>  In AMD, the FM2 + platform is still relevant.  For it, they produce hybrid processors (APU) A6, A8 and A10 of the Kaveri generation.  Uses integrated graphics Radeon R7 and Radeon R5.  The most interesting thing is that the appearance of chips with iGPU influenced the development of game consoles.  Yes, in the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One is used, in fact, a kind of APU from AMD.  Let's compare.  The PlayStation 4 (regular version) chip has integrated graphics with 1152 computing units, 72 texture units and 32 ROP units.  Graphic architecture is the same - GCN.  Works iGPU at a speed of 800 MHz.  According to its characteristics, the integrated video resembles the graphics chip used in the Radeon HD 7870 graphics card. Therefore, it is not surprising that modern consoles often cannot even at 1080p @ 60FPS.  The Radeon R7 integrated into any Kaveri A10 class APU, 512 unified processors, 32 texture units and 8 ROPs.  Roughly speaking, the main elements of iGPU are two times less. <br><br><h3>  The effect of RAM on the performance of integrated graphics </h3><br>  As you know, discrete graphics is equipped with its own set of memory chips.  Now the most popular are GDDR5, GDDR5X and HBM microcircuits.  The integrated video core is forced to use the ‚Äúservices‚Äù of RAM, and therefore there is nothing surprising in the fact that the RAM seriously affects the speed of the iGPU.  However, it is better to see once. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/018/7c9/b31/0187c9b31790469b906835f5634a9592.jpg"><br><br>  Take the following test bench: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Processor <b>AMD A10-7890K</b> (Kaveri); <br>  ‚Ä¢ Motherboard <b>ASUS CROSSBLADE RANGER</b> ; <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Kingston HyperX Predator KHX28C12T2K2 / 8X</b> , DDR3-2800, 2x 4 GB RAM; <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Kingston SSDNow UV400</b> , 240 GB; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Operating system <b>Windows 10 Pro x64</b> , driver 17.2.1. <br><br>  The FM2 + platform supports main memory with an effective frequency up to 2400 MHz.  But we managed to overclock the dual channel kit to 2544 MHz.  The XMP-profile did not load, the processor and the board "do not pull."  As a result, with the Preset graphics "Low quality" in DirectX 12 mode, the mission "Go all out" Battlefield 1 in Full HD resolution was launched. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/666/633/9b0/6666339b0c7f4cd0a324c82a382af592.png"><br><br>  The result is quite expected.  And after overclocking the RAM to 2544 MHz, it became relatively playable.  Yes, relatively playable in Battlefield 1 in 1920x1080 resolution!  At the same time, as the frequency of RAM decreased, the frame rate began to ‚Äúdeflate‚Äù very quickly.  This behavior is manifested in all computer games. <br><br><h3>  Integrated graphics performance in Full HD </h3><br>  Now let's see how different iGPUs feel in modern games.  We used the following central processors: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Intel Core i5-7600K</b> (Kaby Lake, HD 630); <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Intel Core i5-5675C</b> (Broadwell, Iris Pro 6200); <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>AMD A8-7670K</b> (Kaveri, Radeon R7); <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>AMD A10-7890K</b> (Kaveri, Radeon R7). <br><br>  AMD A8 and A10 hybrid processors use different versions of integrated graphics.  Together with the Core i5-7600K processor, a dual-channel <b>Kingston HyperX Fury HX421C14FB2K2 / 16</b> whale was used.  It is without any problems overclocked to the effective 2400 MHz.  For the Intel Core i5-5675C, AMD A8-7670K and AMD A10-7890K processors, the <b>Kingston HyperX Predator KHX28C12T2K2 / 8X</b> set was used in DDR3-2400 mode.  As a small experiment with Battlefield 1 showed earlier, the effective 2400 MHz is the optimal frequency for the graphics processor built into the processor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/beb/187/6e0/beb1876e0737475d8fd008093ce6c458.jpg"><br><br>  The games we took are different.  Both old hits and modern blockbusters.  The graphics quality settings were chosen in such a way that at least one processor would produce a more or less playable frame rate, that is, 25-30 frames per second.  And now to the results. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3f0/404/e7d/3f0404e7de6741678c8d09276cf318cd.png"><br><br>  See, and not everything is so hopeless.  Of course, most of the games we had low graphics quality, but in the case of the Radeon R7 and Iris Pro 6200, a completely playable frame rate (without a drawdown below 25 FPS) was demonstrated in four applications out of thirteen.  Almost 1/3 of titles.  As expected, the integrated graphics of the Kaby Lake processor turned out to be an outsider;  But the Radeon R7 and Iris Pro 6200 show similar results. <br><br>  It is clear that the projects of the level of Rise of the Tomb Raider and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt are not too tough for any modern iGPU, but perhaps in three or four years there will be a built-in graphics that can.  And therefore ... <br><br><h3>  findings </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/568/0f3/7c8/5680f37c8ecd4ad9b1e0e2e72f41e45e.png"><br><br>  Modern processors with integrated graphics have everything you need to build a compact, low-noise media center (HTPC).  Such a PC can always be connected to a TV to watch your favorite movies on it, listen to music and play undemanding games.  On the one hand, iGPU progresses noticeably every year.  Their speed increases significantly.  On the other hand, AAA-projects in Full HD resolution ‚Äúembedded‚Äù, if capable of pulling, it is only with low graphics quality settings.  To play in such conditions, let's face it, is not very comfortable.  So the best (and perhaps the only) version of the gaming iGPU application seems to be building a compact and inexpensive system for your favorite "nettle" - old games in which the graphics have never been in the foreground.  Below is an example configuration that will do an excellent job with this goal: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>AMD A10-7800 processor</b> ; <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>ASRock A68M-ITX R2.0 motherboard</b> ; <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Kingston HyperX Savage RAM (HX321C11SRK2 / 8)</b> ; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Storage <b>Kingston UV400 (SUV400S37 / 240G)</b> ; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Cooling <b>DeepCool HTPC-200</b> ; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Enclosure <b>InWin BP655 200 watts</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/193/431/bb1/193431bb17f443318894af0abf88a097.jpg"><br><br>  Such a system will cost 22-23 thousand rubles.  And it will entertain you on boring evenings. <br><br>  For all fans to combine software pumping components with an immediate upgrade, we give <b>10%</b> discount <b>on HyperX SSD</b> and <b>DDR4 memory</b> <a href="http://hyperx.gg/GeekDNSMassEffect">in DNS stores</a> and <b>10% discount</b> on <b>HyperX Fury</b> drives and <b>DDR3 memory</b> <a href="http://hyperx.gg/GeekCitiMassEffect">in Citylink</a> !
