  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Winter gloves for iPhone for 5 minutes</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Everyone knows how good the capacitive screens in the iPhone and other similar devices and how inconvenient to use them in the cold season. <br>  You have to take off and put on gloves for any reason. <br>  Today, during a walk, I finally got tired of freezing by typing something in ICQ or SMS. <br>  Or juggle gloves by listening to podcasts, answering calls, etc. <br>  I thought a little and decided to remove this problem for myself right after I came home, just by slightly improving my fleece gloves.  But you can redo any other gloves. <br>  Under the cut is my solution to the problem. <br>  <b>Who has difficulties with the stated material, read the last paragraph of the topic, there are proposed other competitive solutions!</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4fb/957/3ec/4fb9573ecf2296f40df51b4c9c44f7e9.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I remembered that at home I have a carbon fiber cloth, it is conductive and should fit perfectly. <br>  Cut a piece of cloth from the canvas, because  it is very easy to "shag", on the other hand reinforced it by gluing a simple Soviet fabric adhesive plaster.  By the way, the thing is excellent, the adhesive layer is not afraid of moisture, and just strong.  T.ch.  I take it on all trips for various unforeseen repairs, and not just as a means to the first-aid kit. <br>  Reaching a piece on the screen, I realized that it was possible to scroll through a large ‚Äúspot‚Äù of material and scroll the screen.  For more ‚Äúsubtle operations,‚Äù such as controlling an iPod app or dialing an SMS, a smaller contact patch is needed. <br>  Wore gloves, determined the place where it is more convenient for me to place this "spot". <br>  Figured pattern for the material and the place of the cut on the glove.  Those.  the place where the conductive material comes out of the glove. <br>  I drew a pattern on the adhesive tape already glued, which seemed to me acceptable. <br>  Electrical cutters made an incision in the glove, and with tweezers dragged the resulting pattern, or rather its tongue, from the inside to the outside.  How and what is located with respect to each other, should be clearly seen from the photos. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/961/a93/43a/961a9343abc08763fda8cc34f7a0813b.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ec8/f59/6a0/ec8f596a0f5a507d91ac1c2c36fdf02f.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e5e/3c5/7e9/e5e3c57e9815837ede8c9e3385c160ea.jpg" alt="image"><br>  An outer ‚Äútongue‚Äù around the perimeter was fastened with a sewing needle and thread.  A little "darned" the surface of the resulting pads on top.  Slightly securing the material that is not resistant to abrasion.  For good it would be possible to cover a mesh of synthetic fabric from above.  It would be safer, but I do not have leisure time now. <br>  The said pad allows you to more accurately feel the place that you need to touch the screen and improves the accuracy of work.  Inside the gloves petal can be arranged as you like.  Capacitive coupling is stable in both positions.  The fabric does not interfere, because  soft  Inside, I did not mount, because  after a short time, he will die there himself and everything will be OK. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/be8/580/696/be858069656186721cce9bce42930f10.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I'm not a seamstress, so I sewed it up and not too ‚Äúclean‚Äù. <br>  First I checked the usability while running the iPod app. <br>  All elements work on ur.  Including such as scrolling the current playback location and rolling back 30 seconds back (see photo at the beginning).  All the rest of the interface management in the phone also works fine. With SMS dialing, the work is also quite acceptable. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9e7/b86/f01/9e7b86f01b2ca9fded34b36adf8e451e.jpg" alt="image"><br>  I must say that all business was about 5 minutes at most. <br>  Here on the writing time notes just went an order of magnitude more;) <br>  <b>About the materials.</b> <br>  Where can I get a fabric such I can not answer.  In St. Petersburg, there is production in the suburbs somewhere.  High conductivity is not needed, <b>rubber is also electrically conductive</b> (you can pull a piece out of the core of old high-voltage silicone ignition wires for cars), it is possible that <b>even aluminum sprayed on lavsan will</b> fit ( <b>full of such packages of products, cartridges from external printers, coffee in vacuum packaging</b> and etc.) <br><br>  <b>I have another solution to the problem.</b> <br>  For example <b>, using a needle and thin copper in the enamel insulation of the winding wire</b> , you can <b>pierce through the tip of the glove finger</b> , and not necessarily tightly, with a large pitch, an area with a diameter of 10 mm or less.  To organize the capacitive coupling of the fingers with the screen, this will be quite enough!  I think it will be even easier, and there are a lot of wires everywhere.  I recommend a diameter of about 0.2 mm.  You can disassemble an old bell, an electromotor from an old toy or player, a burned down fan from a computer, ask a friend of yours, etc.  But here in my house I wasn‚Äôt just at the right moment, but I didn‚Äôt want to disassemble something, I wanted to check the fabric.  Sports interest so to speak.  And I came out of my position. <br>  You can release such a small whale to "upgrade" any gloves in 2 minutes. <br>  There is one more idea how to make it simple.  I will check if it will work, I will share it.

      PS I would be glad if I managed to stir up someone's thought or helped solve the problem. <br><br>  MrPrayer <a href="http://mrprayer.habrahabr.ru/">has</a> found and suggested using a conductive thread suitable for this business.  Here is his sentence: <br>  ‚ÄúYou can use a conductive thread. <br>  <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Making-A-Glove-Work-With-A-Touch-Screen/">www.instructables.com/id/Making-A-Glove-Work-With-A-Touch-Screen</a> <br>  The thread itself can be bought here: <br>  <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php%3Fproducts_id%3D9384">www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=9384</a> <br>  It seems like even to Russia they are delivered cheaply.
