We alone remove data from search results only in some cases.  Read more about this here. <br><br>  Why do you need to contact the webmaster? <br><br>  Even if we do not display the controversial site in the search results, the page will not disappear.  It can still be opened at a direct link or found using other search engines.  Google only indexes pages that already exist on the Internet, and does not select them at their discretion.

I walked through technical support pages for quite a long time and painstakingly just for the sake of advising me to contact the webmaster of an unfriendly resource))) And I myself didn‚Äôt think to search his contacts on his website, but what a strange site, there is even a hint of contacts on it, does Google really think that such sites will leave contact information?</i>  <i>Absurd‚Ä¶</i> <i><br></i> <br>  <i>And below all the same, you can find the following solution algorithms!</i> <i><br></i>  <i>We are again offered to remove unwanted content, according to the usual pattern:</i> <br><br>  Remove unwanted content <br>  Web pages can be removed from the search results by the site owner or directly by Google. <br><br>  What would you like to do? <br><br>  Remove content from your own website from Google search results. <br>  Remove content from another site from Google search results <br><br>  <i>And here we are again in the place where we started!</i> <i><br></i>  <i>This is help!</i> <i><br></i> <br>  <i>We try the second option:</i> <br><br>  What do you want to do? <br>  Delete the data that appears in Google search results <br><br>  <i>after choosing this option, we are asked as usual the leading question:</i> <br><br>  Where is the data displayed? <br><br>  On the website and in Google search results <br><br>  and so on there are many options and forms, but none leads to a solution, in the process I get a message on the screen answering the last question: <br><br>  Google is not responsible for the content of websites that appear in search results.  The sites are managed by webmasters.  This means that even if you remove a page from Google search results, it will still be available on the Internet.  Thus, users can find it in another search engine or on the link. <br><br>  In your case, to remove unwanted content, you must contact the webmaster of the site on which it is published.  If you cannot contact the site administration, contact law enforcement agencies. <br><br>  <i>I understand that Google is not responsible, etc.</i>  <i>but shouldn't Google be helping people prevent the use of this resource by malicious users?</i>  <i>Why Write about the fact that even if Google deletes this data, it will be indexed on another resource!</i>  <i>You know, for the sake of my security, as I think many others in such a situation are ready to write to all search engines, asking them to remove such a site from the index!</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>What kind of politics?</i>  <i>They say why delete if it is still where it is ... so, can it not be possible to solve such requests together?</i>  <i>Shouldn't people have to help each other, all the more having such resources in the person of Google ???</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>In the meantime, my personal data that I would not leave on the Internet under any pretext lie on the site and it is well indexed, and the longer it happens the more likely it is that other similar resources will pick up this data, and with this information it‚Äôs very simple you can use if any prichornik show a little imagination ...</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>As a result, I decided to call the Russian-speaking office in Russia, as I have already said in Ukraine there is not even an e-mail address, only the physical postal address is indicated.</i> <br><br>  <i>So, after waiting a bit and choosing the language of communication, they connected me with a representative who did not introduce himself, it was a girl.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>She attentively listened to my situation in silence and advised all the same to turn on the online support, I again explained that I had just tried to do this in different ways, but there is no contact information anywhere, not even a form of communication!</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>She replied that this could not be, I went through all these stages online, agreeing on which item to press with a representative, to which he replied that these were probably technical temporary problems with the service, to which I replied that this was not a single month</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>(I had problems with Google maps on my android tablet, Google Nexus and I tried to find a solution, but as now, then all the attempts did not end with anything, I did not get any support for the same reason as now. First time problem: I buy goods, pay real money for the device and software, but I can‚Äôt get support at all, I regret buying a google-tablet, the tablet itself is excellent, but the lack of support scares, and what if my life depends on it, and the only I will have an option</i>  <i>isat in a support ...)</i> <br><br>  <i>So after I said that this is not a minute failure, the girl said you still fill out the form.</i>  <i>I had to raise my voice so that the girl finally understood that there was no form of communication, neither by the links that I found, nor by the link that she dictated.</i>  <i>She began to explain that this could not be, I began to demand communication options with technical support, telephone, Skype, mail, whatever, she said, okay</i> <i><br></i>  <i>write down your address, dictate an e-mail address with a surname and initials, I dictated it several times in response to letters, she dictated in response, everything came together.</i>  <i>He said thanks and hung up.</i> <br><br>  <i>I wrote a letter ... and it returned safely, since there is no such address, an auto reply came from the server ...</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Here is a story.</i> <br><br>  <b>Total:</b> <br>  <i>Frustration in the company more and more.</i>  <i>People do not consider people to be.</i>  <i>Although this is nothing new.</i>  <i>But I always want to believe in a bright future, and not in a dark, inhuman existence dominated by monopolists with an inhuman orientation.</i> <br><br>  <i>ps, but when I found the technical support phone in contacts, adwords made a call, listened to the answering machine and realized that you can contact the specialists only if you have an adwords user number there, then I hung up.</i>  <i>So I wrote to the post office, a certain Ekaterina :) in five minutes (it turns out that when there is an opportunity to earn money, they quickly know how to connect my mobile from which I called with my mailbox, and even write a letter sympathizing with me about whether I liked everything in the service and those adwords support are asked to fill in the questionnaire ...)</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Previously, if I bought a phone or any other device, I understood that in case of questions I was always happy to help, and here google Selling tablets and, in principle, providing a huge range of services in principle and sends everyone to google, with or without .</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/185618/">https://habr.com/ru/post/185618/</a></p>
