      The essence of the problem is simple - Disney, who bought the rights to Star Wars! = Lucas.  For many years, the cult space around the Force and its generation was very weakly controlled, which, in particular, made it possible for it to bloom so luxuriantly.  Actually all appeals to the murdered spirit of Star Wars, with which the social networks are filled, and about which Lucas himself wrote, have to do with how the cult will live outside of cinema space. <br><br>  What we know for sure - numerous toasters and waffle irons with Darth Vader are dying out in the last days - Disney is famous for its manic legal service, which for years has made the studio horizon protected by studio rights.  For you to properly evaluate Disney's capabilities - US copyright terms are reviewed every time Mickey Mouse's rights approach the expiration line.  Disney is one of the main lobbyists in the copyright zone. <br><br><blockquote>  This, of course, does not mean that they will be lost.  Simply, they will become more expensive in the amount of the license, <a href="http://www.freshdoc.ru/nevskyiplaw/peredaca_objecov_iplaw/licenzionnye_dogovory/iskljuchitelnaja_obshhij/%3Ffullscreen%3D1">something like this</a> . <br></blockquote><br>  Where all this goes, in fact, it is not clear.  It is known that Disney relatively recently drew attention to the accompanying business, starting with the princesses <a href="http://redrumers.com/2015/12/28/how-disney-princesses-mattel-hasbro/">(read the detailed layout here</a> ) and it is clear from the process and amounts that they have tasted this part of the pie and will not give it to anyone.  How far they can get into litigation is incomprehensible - the images of star wars over the years have really penetrated much where.  For example, an excellent incident - <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BC">ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedaism</a> .  In theory, all these people owe Disney money.  But we understand that the chances for this are slim.  Is it enough to write the "dark side" and "light side", as is done on the <a href="http://www.maniaco.ru/">site of Maniaco</a> , to violate the rights? <br><br>  In any case, there is a good chance that in the near future not only the life of Star Wars will change, but also the life around Star Wars.  It remains only to understand, this is the transition to the dark side of greedy Commerce or the departure to the bright side "but now everything is strictly according to the law." <br><br>  Speaking of the picture to attract attention.  I responsibly declare that this is a general educational article using an image for educational purposes.  We have the right ;-) <br><br>  ¬© Kirill Gotovtsev &amp; Kirill Mityagin </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297726/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297726/</a></p>
