  <section class="page js-page"><h1>12th Russian spy worked at Microsoft</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/4/2009/02/microsoft-spy.jpg" alt="image"><br>  I think many of you have heard of Russian spies who were stealing intellectual secrets of the United States under the guise of ordinary Americans.  But recently, another news spread to all the Western media - the story that one of the alleged spies worked at Microsoft for a few months as a junior software tester. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The suspect's name is Alexey Karetnikov, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/alexey.karetnikov">here</a> you can look at his Facebook page.  He is 20 years old, married, graduated from St. Petersburg State Polytechnic University, he indicated the city of residence Redmond, and in the list of jobs there are two companies: Microsoft and Neobit.  According to Bloomberg, Neobit is a software company whose partners are the Russian Ministry of Defense and the FSB.  The Russian Foreign Ministry declined to comment on this news. <br>  Karetnikov was deported on charges of violating United States immigration laws, ITAR-TASS reported, citing Matt Chandler, spokesman for the US Department of Homeland Security.  The Russian confessed to the violation and agreed to the deportation, apparently to avoid litigation, according to the US national news service. <br><br>  In a federal court in Manhattan, ten members of the espionage organization pleaded guilty to conspiracy and working as foreign agents under cover.  They confessed that they transferred money and encrypted messages, communicated with Russian officials and taught others how to look for information useful for Russia.  Their main goal was to penetrate the leadership of the United States after the creation of fake personalities. <br>  Some Russian spies, working for software companies, tried to achieve the use of special software in several US companies.  It seems that in this way they tried to inject spyware modules that could send useful data to Russia. <br><br>  Currently, according to the Russian media, the deported Russians are being questioned by the Russian foreign intelligence service in the south of Moscow, and this process can continue for several weeks.  It is reported that some agents will be able to continue working in the security service, and someone will have to start a new career in a more relaxed industry.

      As for Microsoft, the American journalists are joking that the corporation has a great opportunity to write off many of the failures to the spy scandal.  For example, it is no longer necessary to endure the humiliation and talk about closing the project Keen due to poor sales.  Now you can report that the cause of the inglorious death of phones - sabotage within the company.  After all, this sounds much better, and Karetnikov cannot comment on anything, since now he is probably halfway to Siberia. <br><br>  According to information: <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-07-14/microsoft-says-12th-alleged-russian-spy-was-employee.html">source 1</a> , <a href="http://www.microsoft-watch.com/content/corporate/microsoft_employed_alleged_russian_spy.html">source 2</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/99396/">https://habr.com/ru/post/99396/</a></p>
