  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The Ural Automobile Plant automates IT infrastructure management based on IBM solutions.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  IBM Corporation announces the successful completion of the project for the implementation of the IT infrastructure management system of the Ural Automobile Plant OJSC of the GAZ Group, one of the largest and fastest growing enterprises in the automotive industry in Russia, a leading manufacturer of all-wheel drive trucks. <br><br>  Within the framework of this project, a harmonious IT infrastructure management system of OJSC ‚ÄúUral Automobile Plant‚Äù OJSC was created using IBM Tivoli technologies on the UNIX server platform IBM System p.  The solution was integrated with existing HR and Production Management Systems (BAAN). <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  The first stage of the project was the creation of an IT infrastructure monitoring system, the task of which was to provide on-duty administrators with information on the state of the plant's IT infrastructure and information systems.  Equipment (telecommunication, computing, engineering), operating systems, system and application software (software) were included in the contour of the monitoring system.  Thus, sections of different groups of administrators gained access to general information, thanks to which their work became more coordinated, and for the head of the DIT, the monitoring system became a kind of ‚Äúarbiter‚Äù in analyzing the causes of accidents.  ‚ÄúDue to the regular monitoring of all components and comparison with threshold values ‚Äã‚Äãcorresponding to the nature of normal operation, many upcoming failures were predicted in advance, which made it possible to diagnose and eliminate the causes of future failure before production information systems stop,‚Äù commented Boris Raichenko, Director of the System Department. integration "Getnet Consulting".

      The second stage of work consisted in creating an IT infrastructure inventory system used for regular inventory of existing equipment and software at the plant, identifying unauthorized changes in PC hardware and software configuration, as well as centralized automatic installation of software packages on PCs.  Within the framework of the project, all PCs were ‚Äúpersonalized‚Äù and tied to the users working behind them, providing data on the PC with data from the personnel database about users, which allowed the support service to obtain more accessible information for analysis and processing. <br><br>  As a result of the project, inventory databases of existing equipment and installed software, mechanisms for automatic distribution of software packages on a PC, and a monitoring console with actual information on IT infrastructure have been created and maintained up to date. <br><br>  The IT management system simplified the inventory of equipment, which had a positive effect on the asset management process; the automatic installation of the BAAN management system software enabled administrators to distribute this software to all PCs from a single center.  ‚ÄúThe joint work of the monitoring and inventory system allowed the dispatching service of the Ural Automobile Plant OJSC to monitor the current state of the systems (proactive monitoring) and changes that took place over two weeks (periodic inventory).  All this made it possible to assess the current situation and identify bottlenecks in order to prevent possible failures, ‚Äùsaid Yuri Nam, Director of the Information Technology Center of the Ural Automobile Plant, GAZ Group. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe integrated IT management approach that IBM implements in the AZ Ural project is designed to ensure the operation of not just a specific IT infrastructure node, but the integrated operation of a business service provided by the IT service,‚Äù said Alexander Klimanov, Head of Tivoli sales in the industrial sector, IBM in Russia and the CIS. <br><br>  Software products that were used in the project: IBM Tivoli Configuration Manager, IBM Tivoli Storage Manager, IBM Tivoli Storage Manager, IBM Tivoli Monitoring Console, IBM Tivoli Storage Manager, IBM Tivoli Enterprise Console, IBM Tivoli Monitoring, IBM TotalStorage Productivity Center, IBM Director. <br><br>  The system was implemented by the efforts of GETNET Consulting, which is the official IBM business partner in Russia and the CIS countries since 1991 in the status of IBM Premier Business Partner. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/38034/">https://habr.com/ru/post/38034/</a></p>
