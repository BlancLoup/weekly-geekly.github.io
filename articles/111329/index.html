  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Computer in the car "cheap" or CarPC "Siberian"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Almost every motorist listens to music in his car, and everyone thought that it would be nice to listen to what you want (this is only in Moscow and St. Petersburg radio stations for every taste).  Naturally, now auto-recorders reading just CDs are already living out on flea markets, they have been replaced by CD-MP3 and others, which by the way are not fashionable either, the most relevant now as far as I understand it are USB head devices or some SD card reader.  But what can they do?  Well, let's say some read only MP3s, others WMA or even there the hell knows that, some understand Russian tags and file names, some do not understand if all this pleasure is also with a normal screen and shows video (again, not all players play a great bunch video formats), then it costs at least 300 bucks, and if it‚Äôs still from a normal manufacturer, then everything is 700. In principle, a computer can do all this, then what‚Äôs stopping it from getting into the car? <br><br><img src="http://img708.imageshack.us/img708/4905/imagesbg.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This topic has already been raised more than once, but since the high-tech age has now happened, I think it would not be superfluous to discuss it again. <br>  So, first we will think about what obstacles will stand in our way of introducing one miracle of technical progress into another. <br>  1. Touch Screen Monitor <br>  2. Power supply <br>  3. Corps <br>  4. installation problems <br>  In addition to these basic problems, there are still many nuances, such as sound output, hard disk, installation of the system unit and wiring, installation of additional devices.

      Now, having understood how much crap can be ogresti, we need a sweet carrot suspended in front of you on a fishing rod that will lead you through all the difficulties, that is, what we can get in the end (or rather what I wanted to get): <br>  1. Reproduction of all audio formats with support for tags and other buns. <br>  2. The same as 1st only with video (well, since this is a computer, why not just listen to audio instead of playing clips of your favorite group, simultaneously shocking hamsters, and Che, good bluff is more expensive than money. <br>  3. Navigation (since we already bury a decent amount of money in this business, we need to squeeze everything we can from it, and having spent the extra 1.5k rubas on the gps receiver, it will not be too much navigation). <br>  4. Simple control (here I would like to note the presence of a touchscreen, without which all this is actually a useless undertaking, it is necessary for navigation, for simple control of audio-video players and for almost everything else, of course, nobody canceled wireless mice with clavs, but although sometimes needed, they still can not do). <br>  5. High-quality sound, as far as possible (well, everything is solved quite simply, more abruptly, more agile, well, speakers ... and what about them without that). <br>  6. Simple connection of periphery (the essence is that the system engineer is most likely to be installed in a hard-to-reach place, and in order not to go there every time to connect a USB flash drive with a fresh music, you need to organize something like a USB hub, somewhere near at hand) <br><br>  Well, perhaps this is still enough, and to begin with it can be implemented at least that way, and in theory you can screw in there a lot of things, starting from WiFi and GPRS modules, ending with web cameras for video registration and reverse, as well as various engine monitoring via OBD2 or something like that. <br><br>  And now we move on to the most pressing issue of loot.  His then, just had a very limited amount.  And nevertheless the severe Siberian potsans will not be scattered with an honestly worked out loot to the left, to the right. <br><br>  To begin with, in addition to the usual computer set, we will need a special power supply and a monitor with a touchscreen.  I was puzzled by the question of monique long before the assembly, it was probably one of the main and most expensive components of the system.  I edited all the forums dedicated to this issue such as pccar.ru and the like, generally sensible forums in Russian, only 3-4 pieces, the rest is garbage.  As a result, I concluded that if you take a ready-made monique, then at a minimum it will cost somewhere in the 500 bucks. Next on the agenda is the power supply.  As everyone knows, the computer internals do not use a voltage higher than 12V, and the voltage of the vehicle‚Äôs electrical system is just about that.  To be precise, when I was running, I had 14 volts, and the battery gives around 12V.  Well, then everything is simple, you can use a conventional car inverter and connect it to a computer with a conventional 220V power supply, and you can use a special, automotive power supply designed for operation from 8 to 28 volts.  In general, different models of blocks have different input voltages, but this is not important, the main thing is that I didn‚Äôt like the option with an inverter and therefore I need from 70 to 200 evergreen for a power supply unit.  In short, from the previously planned 800 bucks for all this, I had somewhere 200 for a kit, and since I had an amp with an old car (of course, I picked it up with the sub for sale), then I was almost on budget. <br><br><h5>  What happened to me </h5><br><br>  Let's start with the face of the entire system, with the monitor.  Having decided on what I have, namely: a 2DIN in-dash monitor, that is, a monitor mounted in a panel instead of a 2-din radio, just in my Nissan there was exactly 2-din hole (shelf and mafan).  In general, monitors are still leaving (I found them not practical because of Siberia ...) and separately installed on the panel (though I don‚Äôt stick to install Monique, but leaving it at night is a gift to Siberian people).  Since in our shops in our stores in Gomsk, you can not even ask anything like that, I started to stick to Google.  I found the nearest shops only in Moscow, and if I was satisfied with the price tag, I would have puzzled one ‚Äúnative Moscow artist‚Äù, but everything was sad there.  Climbing all sorts of dialectrames, reaching ebay, I accidentally stumbled upon an electronic component store, in a nearby Novosibe (as I stumbled upon it, do not ask) I found an interesting thing there.  <a href="http://trigon-rnd.ru/product/monitor-70-a070vw04-s-kontrollerom-sva080a-r12/">Packageless monitor</a> and <a href="http://trigon-rnd.ru/product/sensornaja-panel-dlja-monitora-diagonalju-7/">touch panel</a> .  And then my hand toad began to quietly strangle me and persuade me to buy this kit and somehow pack it all into a car panel, especially since it was all 7 inches in size, which is the size of a hole in the panel.  Phoned to this store, I ordered everything for 5400r + 300r delivery.  The package arrived a week later and I immediately began the experiments. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/b4503bd5/2e12902e/3d0fe4c9/3456b796.jpg"><br> <code>   ,   ""   ,      ,   3 </code> <br> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/a5981662/149b394f/1893451c/849aa545.jpg"><br> <code> ,   </code> <br> <br>  As a result, I taped the monitor to a 2-sided scotch (and what did it do for him), and the monitor to the metal case was a dead 2x mystery tape recorder, with a torn front panel and discarded interiors.  Inside the case, I hid the touchscreen controllers (by the way, USB-shny) and the monitor.  It turned out so-so, but it stood firmly in place, did not falter, showed well and the touch worked also not badly.  The main thing from the outside, through the tint, in the off state, it was not at all clear what kind of crap it was, and if there was anything in general, according to this, the narkis were not particularly attracted.  In short on the monitor, I saved 300 bucks. <br><br>  With regards to the system officer, then here, too, is not all simple.  Since I didn‚Äôt want to put it in the trunk, it should not be big, but I also decided not to rush to the extreme and mount everything under the panel.  I installed the computer under the driver's seat, because of the relatively small size, it did not interfere there, and if that is, always at hand.  As a case, I used an ordinary mini-itix case.  The power supply, after much deliberation, it was decided to take a normal one and not collective farm any inverters and disassembled IBPshniki.  Again, having climbed the forums, diablox on ibei was found the most deshmansky <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/Car-PC-DC-DC-160W-8V-28V-Mini-ITX-M2-ATX-Power-PSU-12V-/180608435596%3Fpt%3DUK_AudioElectronicsVideo_Video_TelevisionSetTopBoxes%26hash%3Ditem2a0d1a058c">PSU</a> , model M2-ITX (in general, it is Chinese fake Chinese crafts), but in principle, it turned out to be very working and quite functional, in short for 2 Kasar.  Next on the list is the motherboard.  I looked at something like <a href="">this</a> .  Since I did not want to limit the performance (and it would be enough in principle), it was decided - no atoms.  And I still had to buy it for 2400, because I had nothing like that.  <a href="http://www.nix.ru/autocatalog/intel/CPU_Intel_Core_Duo_E6300_1.86_1066_LGA775_52349.html">Core Duo E6300 processor</a> , I squeezed on the occasion, for this I do not take into account the cost, I actually took the mother under it.  His power is enough for everything, and at the same time he is not particularly voracious, respectively, slightly warming.  Memory - 2 gigu sticks, supplemented with radiators, also for free, cut at work ... and no, I am not ashamed, because the premium floor was not paid for that month ... Hard disk, here everything was not immediately clear, but then after reading the forums, I bought a seagate notebook screw for 320 gigs (by the way, in winter it doesn‚Äôt start right away, but crumpled in 15, half a warm-up period), and calmed down, of course, ideally ssd, but expensive, and this one works.  And all would be nothing, but the last touch is not enough - zvukovuha.  Generally speaking, I tried with the integrated one, it certainly works, but from the outside on the koshernee.  Under the screams, I was creative with the sound of a creative Brathelnikovsky company, I think this is not the best thing that can be, but certainly more fun than the built-in one, but the fact that it is better is much more expensive.  On this perhaps everything, well, except that sidyuk, I stuck it to install the Venda, having picked it out of the laptop, but he didn‚Äôt get accustomed there, and why was he there, under the seat ... <br><br><h5>  Soft </h5><br><br>  At the very beginning, when everything was assembled, I quickly put the XP-shku, and ran to check everything. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/18ce9fb2/d9d2096c/eb8a0429/dc895b72.jpg"><br> <code>    ,  </code> <br> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/5445bd67/916ee898/13c8cf17/286be1a7.jpg"><br> <code>     ,  ,  </code> <br> <br> <code>(,    ,   ,    ,            )</code> <br> <br>  Then he put 7k with the Centrafuse shell, it was specially designed and thought out for that, it works perfectly.  As navigation, Dublisa is enough for me, with the script disabling advertising.  I already know the city, except to find some address or company.  There was also a MS Office, for viewing some of the Excel plates, well, and there on the little things.  There were thoughts about Linux, but somehow the Windows is dearer, and then there is no Centrafuse under Linux, but there was no desire and time for this to be tricky, this idea was already devoured in abundance.  By the way, if you pick up a mother, then I think it won't be a problem to stick a Mac OS in there, for special perversions. <br><br><h5>  Attachment Equipment </h5><br><br>  From the mounted there is a 6-port active USB hub (powered from a computer).  A GPS receiver is plugged into it, a transmitter for a mouse with a keyboard, a WiFi module (by the way, I used it only 1 time, as I didn‚Äôt need it), ir a receiver with a remote control from dealextreme, that's all. <br><br><h5>  Connection </h5><br><br>  To begin with, I connected the computer to the onboard network with a separate wire, which I spent from under the hood to the salon.  Since the wire‚Äôs cross section was small, it heated up and everything was buggy.  Then I bought a thick cable, with a fuse, on it I installed the on / off switch.  I fed them an amplifier and a computer, and the computer was connected through a farad capacitor (bought at a flea market on the cheap).  The cable was connected to the ‚Äú+‚Äù battery terminal, and the ‚Äú-‚Äù was simply thrown to ground.  The amplifier is located under the passenger seat, because it is 4-channel then 2 stereo wires came from it, which in turn had a quad in the driver, and from it wires go to a standard block under the panel.  And from there already on the speakers, which by the way, got from the previous owner of my car (by the way, not bad speakers, it is not clear why he disdained to twist them, although he unscrewed the mafon).  With such an audio system connected, no noise or interference was noticed, some of them could hear generator noise, but everything was fine with me.  And now the most interesting, on and off.  In order not to poke a button, tricky Chinese people on the power supply fouled up ACC control (this is the control signal that is generated when the ignition key is turned to the desired position).  Actually, that was how it was connected, the amplifier and the computer are turned on when the ignition key is turned, and the computer (the power supply has several modes) 5 seconds after the appearance of the signal so as not to interfere with starting the car.  But the whole thing is turned off after turning the key back, and it does not turn off, but goes into hibernation for 15 minutes, and if the ACC signal is not given within 15 minutes, it is completely cut down (in fact, this is ACC that is normal + 12 volts). <br><br><h5>  What did you want, but did not work </h5><br><br>  I also wanted a GSM modem to fasten a thread, but after looking at the tariffs for gsm anlovy and changed my mind like that (and I wanted to have Internet radio).  The FM Tuner was also in the project, but in the 1st a <a href="http://www.digitalcar.ru/shop/product_info.php%3Fproducts_id%3D3065">good tuner</a> costs at least $ 100, in the 2nd there is nothing to listen to in our radio program, the FM band starts with some kind of rad-alla, ends with cattle-chanson, that is, blatnyak.  No, I even took the tuner to drive, I tried, well, it works in my program, but I could not fasten it to this centrifuge which was Centrafuse, in short this hemorrhage is not worth it.  There was also a hard desire to shove a USB sidyuk somewhere, but when I traveled, it was not needed.  And also a rear-view camera, and a camera in the direction of travel, for video registration (I tried it by the way, but it stuck with it sometimes, sometimes it was possible to pick up something different from the software, but I decided to refuse it stupidly, I don‚Äôt need it to me).  And most importantly, actually this alone made up about a third of my expectations - ODB2 diagnostics.  At first I studied this question least, I looked, it seems that people work, well, I will.  But no.  Manufacturers of cars, it seems, have come up with a universal diagnostic connector, but they did not agree on the protocols.  That's why what I was counting on for <a href="http://www.dealextreme.com/details.dx/sku.28528">1000 re</a> (my friend bought this thing, I even took to drive, but nefig did not work out, he played on her shevik and sold it to her), it turned out <a href="http://www.vobd.ru/">4 times more expensive</a> for me.  And so I never got to that. <br><br><h5>  Once again about the money </h5><br><br>  If you count the costs: the monitor is 6000r (by the way, now the monitors became much cheaper and became more accessible than a year and a half ago, when I planned everything, even models without vga, only <a href="http://car-fi.ru/bu7.html">usb appeared</a> ), a system engineer: (BP-2000r, mother-2400, screw -2000, the case with the usual power supply - 1500, memory, percents and zvukovuha I got for free on this do not take into account) -7900, here in theory we still need to add an amp, but I already had it ... and yes, still a capacitor - 500r .  As a result, my expenses amounted to about 14.5 tyrs, which is even less than expected (I do not consider any tinsel like a usb hub, clavs with a mouse and wires, because they either cost a penny or were brazenly wrung out).  In this situation, what I do not take into account is another 5 thousand, if it is easier to take the amp, but to leave the integrashka zvukovuhu (by the way, <a href="http://www.digitalcar.ru/shop/index.php%3FcPath%3D262_240">they</a> came up with a very elegant solution for sound, I would even buy if it wasn‚Äôt all). <br><br><h5>  What is the result </h5><br><br>  Now I have another car, I sold that one recently (having previously twisted all the equipment), so to speak, upgraded it, and I have been driving with a regular radio tape recorder already for a month.  It is impossible to install all this good here, or rather there is no place to plug a monitor.  To do this, you will either have to change the panel (for which there is no money yet), because there is only 1din hole: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/30363d79/5cb46add/f0901bab/501eecf9.jpg"><br><br>  ... or buy a hinged monique (for which, again, there is no money), and no one has canceled narkov.  And now, having got used to the multimedia omnipotence for a year, I look crookedly at what is sticking out of the panel and continue to be disheartened.  In general, I think that 15000-20000 for such an undertaking, the amount is very small. <br><br>  Here are a few more pictures of the systemist, although I still installed software at home and that's why there is a regular power supply, but somehow I will get it out of the garage and take a photo. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/caf580ac/ee7f6d2e/ae0ca664/d6a41375.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/64bb44e0/cb130ac4/713c3a3e/df92480c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/6d7ebe52/f007c06a/b9f45321/61b69b4d.jpg"><br><br>  PS: And the neighbors Kits liked back to watch movies on pokatushkakh. <br><br>  <a href="">img403.imageshack.us/img403/336/dsc00114u.jpg</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/111329/">https://habr.com/ru/post/111329/</a></p>
