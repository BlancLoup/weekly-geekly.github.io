Baer worked as a senior engineer in the defense company Loral Electronics, he developed an analog computer for radar installations.  Knowledge in this area was very useful to him when working on video games.  One of the tasks was to develop a model of black and white TV. <br><br>  At that time, only all electronics companies tried to master this promising market.  While working on a television receiver, Baer thought, why not do something in it that distinguishes him from the works of competitors: for example, a special channel operating on the frequency of television channels 3 or 4 (they were not busy at that time).  Baer called this channel LP (Let's Play!), And on it the TV viewer could ... play interactive games.

      Thoughts about LP, written in pencil in a notebook, Baer shared with his boss, Loral Senior Engineer Sam Leckof, who commissioned Baer to create "the best TV in the world."  In response, he heard the bureaucratic: ‚ÄúForget it, man.  Just make this damn TV.  We are so wildly out of the schedule. "  The concept of video games has been waiting for <b>15 years</b> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Brown box </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/855/28b/35a/85528b35ab7177388a6b492f99671b11.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fbc/9d4/e4f/fbc9d4e4f0999e40081c4023d4020050.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Baer‚Äôs first experiments on the use of a television screen for games refer to 1966.  Enlisting the support of two engineers and receiving $ 2,500 for the experiment (about $ 17,000 in 2014 prices), Baer created the Brown Box for two years - the world's first console system for video games.  It received its name in honor of the fact that its outer coating was made under veneer.  For four years, Baer could not find a company that would undertake to promote this unusual product to the market.  This happened only in 1972, when Baer modified his ‚ÄúBrown Box‚Äù - this console was named Magnavox Odyssey. <br><br><h4>  Magnavox odyssey </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/987/f30/835/987f308358e2d17a01bcc6b49b90a02a.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Console advertising <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/H2EIsnr_cv4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhG8hyamR1JoGH7p8G0U9fHsLFs6A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Unboxing <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/WPLjE_LzvDc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhh26cZBFFecgSay6nYMlf0K-I8aWg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Magnavox Odyssey <a href="http://www.pong-story.com/o1faq.txt">FAQ</a> <br><br>  After long negotiations, Baer was able to sign an agreement with electronics manufacturer Magnavox.  In the 72nd year, the first game console, Magnavox Odyssey, goes on sale.  For her created 27 games on 12 cartridges.  On the eleventh cartridge the game Basketball was originally supposed to appear;  basketball eventually appeared on the eighth cartridge, and the eleventh was not released. <br><br>  Odyssey's capabilities were limited: only three points were displayed on the screen, which represent two players and a ball, as well as a dividing line between players.  To improve the effect of the game, the package included transparent overlays on the TV, which imitated the color and conditions of the game. <br><br>  In addition, poker chips, dice, game boards similar to those used in board games, as well as a sheet to keep score, went with the console, as games did not allow to do this on the screen. <br><br>  From 1972 to 1975, about 330 thousand consoles were sold, in 1975 the production of Odyssey was curtailed and the model was replaced with the Odyssey 100, a simple Pong-shaped console. <br><br>  Magnavox filed a lawsuit against Nolan Bushnell because the game ‚ÄúPong‚Äù resembled ‚Äútennis‚Äù for Magnavox Odyssey.  Over the next decade, Magnavox sued other large companies, such as Coleco, Mattel, Seeburg, Activision, and won or settled every case.  In 1985, Nintendo sued Magnavox and attempted to invalidate Baer‚Äôs patent by claiming William Hijinbassam‚Äôs Tennis for Two video game was created in 1958. The court ruled that this game did not use video signals and could not be classified as a video game.  As a result, Nintendo lost the lawsuit and continued to pay royalties. <br><br><h4>  Specifications </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4fd/6c0/247/4fd6c0247b5848b5b68c43bb1731ee6b.jpg"><br>  Large PDF <a href="http://www.pong-story.com/1tl200blak_sch.pdf">here</a> <br><br>  By modern standards, this seems surprising, but the prefix did not have not only a microprocessor, but also microchips - Odyssey was based on diode-transistor logic implemented on discrete elements, and contained 40 transistors and 40 diodes.  Many people mistakenly consider this system analog, explaining that the presence of discrete components.  However, although the analog circuits were used to control the game (manipulators) and display information on the screen, the core of the game element synthesis itself was completely digital.  Also, Ralph Baer himself considers the system digital. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1bd/cba/b44/1bdcbab44afe0375d08b7b56d8c2ede8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The console used special replaceable game cards that were inserted into the slot, similar to the cartridge slot in more modern game consoles.  They did not contain any electronic components, only jumpers between the pins.  These jumpers connected different signal generators inside the console to create an image on the screen.  The prefix was able to display three points (two of them are player-controlled, one is a ‚Äúball‚Äù) and a vertical line in the middle of the screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/87d/d5f/84f/87dd5f84f45d48489967e4e8c8be25bb.jpg"><br>  Description of the modules <a href="http://www.pong-story.com/odymodul.htm">here</a> <br><br>  The system was sold along with transparent plastic overlays that users had to impose on the TV screen to simulate color graphics.  The overlays had dimensions that fit only two of the possible sizes of television screens ‚Äî 18 and 23 inches.  Some of the overlays could be used with the same cartridge, changing the rules of the game.  The console also included plastic game pieces and sheets for account management, almost like in regular board games. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5a7/6f2/1a0/5a76f21a0fef43f98294d8ce4d747410.jpg"><br><br>  Management was carried out with the help of two manipulators.  On each of the manipulators there were two disks located on different sides - the left disk was responsible for moving horizontally, the right one - vertically.  In addition to the standard manipulators supplied with the console, it was possible to buy and use the light gun of the Shooting Gallery. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/664/9e1/38b/6649e138b8c29e754b0c861c728c28e5.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Light gun.  The lightgun was used by four games: Shootout, Shooting Gallery, Prehistoric Safari and Dogfight. <br><br>  The sounds of the console, like most Pong-type systems, could not be reproduced. <br><br>  Odyssey worked on six type C batteries, or on a power supply (sold separately). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a70/6c6/17a/a706c617aac24fa2aa9a4f78748e12ed.jpg"><br>  Ralph Baer also proposed the concept of ‚Äúactive cartridges‚Äù containing additional electronic components, adding more game features such as sound effects, variable network position, different ball speeds, etc. Unfortunately, this idea did not interest anyone.  In retrospect, all manufacturers of ROM-based cartridges might have been required to pay Sanders partners if Baer registered a patent for his ‚Äúactive cartridges‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/90d/fbc/13b/90dfbc13bd25b1c2025a1f4dd99a1c12.gif" alt="image"><br>  "Content" cartridge.  Cartridges did not contain a component, they were just ‚Äújumpers‚Äù. <br><br><h4>  Games </h4><br><br>  You can watch the game on the video, who is too lazy - below there are screenshots <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/BoD70wLR2R0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjLDWUcg__kEkv_5f22911w0spIwg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Screenshots</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Analogy <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aad/02b/5c1/aad02b5c191f4c93a3d8d1bd860c158b.jpg"><br><br>  Cat and mouse <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/50c/5f9/30a/50c5f930aa7245729e08addd262233a2.jpg"><br><br>  Football <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3b2/e8f/1e8/3b2e8f1e818245839661a6e5f707ff19.jpg"><br><br>  Skiing <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/69e/c3a/d84/69ec3ad845e443cca479ac28395cec30.jpg"><br><br>  Hockey <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2de/9e9/68d/2de9e968ddcb4416a75ea55df48ad39e.jpg"><br><br>  Roulette <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b3e/0f7/acd/b3e0f7acd50c4332ae287e17bb6c9bda.jpg"><br><br>  Simon says <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eee/458/690/eee4586909894c2c8b7135369dfdeafe.jpg"><br><br><h5>  States </h5><br>  For the TV was created nozzle with a map of the United States, and with the help of a joystick, you can specify any state. <br><br><h5>  Haunted house </h5>  One player plays the role of a detective who must find as many treasures in a haunted house as possible, and the second player must put the detective to do it as a cast. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1ba/7dd/1f4/1ba7dd1f41fc4e3593aac08b632928fe.jpg"><br><br>  In Submarine shooter, the submarine must sink the opponent's ship. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a14/2b9/ed5/a142b9ed55e04a8dad1029d2e681acff.jpg"><br></div></div><br><br><h4>  Chronology of the creation of the first console </h4><br><br>  1 Sept. 1966 <br>  I wrote a four-page document describing my plans for a simple video game. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ecf/208/095/ecf2080956d04728916065b338aec9af.jpg"><br><br>  6 Sept. 1966 <br>  Drew a game scheme for two players. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3d5/5e0/b0e/3d55e0b0e601878abb54ada965a0de45.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  7 May 1967 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b05/65c/e51/b0565ce518064cbf9c4927b8ac69320e.jpg"><br><br>  14 June 1967 <br>  First light gun <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/181/e48/0d9/181e480d9040f2c12ffb618094f5f630.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Oct-Nov 1967 <br>  Developed the Ping-Pong concepts with Bill Rusch and Bill Harrison (fellow engineers from Sanders Associates). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a69/532/fb6/a69532fb664641b0bceaeaa76bcf872f.jpg"><br><br>  9-13 Nov 1967 <br>  Demonstration of the full-featured ping-pong game <br><br>  15 Jan 68 <br>  The first patent for video games <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c3c/2d9/2e3/c3c2d92e36d20d83ea3a522babc116ca.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  1 Oct 1968 <br>  Demonstration of ping-pong, volleyball, soccer, shooters.
