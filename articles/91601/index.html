  <section class="page js-page"><h1>QIWI - service to pay for everyday services</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It was February 28, I just returned from a long trip, it was necessary to pay for home Internet.  It so happened that I had to use the QIWI terminal.  In general, nothing that I would do for the first time and could be mistaken somewhere.  I chose the provider, entered the contract number, put the money in, took the receipt.  Nothing foreshadowed trouble <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I come home, the money did not reach.  I decided to wait, maybe the money will reach the morning.  The next morning the money is still not reached.  Time passes, the Internet is very necessary, we decided to pay with the girl through another terminal, through which money usually comes immediately.  Internet, respectively, almost immediately included.  We paid and lived in peace until the end of the month, until it was time to pay again.  On the day of payment it turns out that my money has not reached. <br><br>  As a result, I am writing a letter to QIWI on March 23 - such receipts are such, the money has not yet reached, I ask you to figure out what I get the answer the next day, that for some reason, on March 10, I received a payment to some unknown person. TELE2 number

      Naturally I write the answer (March 24) - where does TELE2 come from?  I paid for the Internet service provider, as I wrote in my claim. <br>  A week later, I received the answer that, according to my request, a task was created with No. 96xxx. <br>  It takes 3 weeks, I’m calling to find out why they took my money, they took a percentage for the provision of the service, but they can't provide this service for two whole months?  The girl replied using a bunch of template (apparently binding for employees) phrases.  The meaning of the conversation came about like this: <br><br>  - Name the payment data (receipts) <br>  - * I call * <br>  - You need to send us a letter with a complaint by mail and we will consider <br>  - Girl, I have already sent such a letter 2 weeks ago, and my application has been being processed for 3 weeks already.  What's the matter? <br>  - Wait, then, while they will contact you, thanks for calling * further standard phrases * <br><br>  There was no sense from the call, as I understood it. <br><br>  It has been almost 2 months from the date of payment.  QIWI website proudly declares: “QIWI guarantees Payment through QIWI (QIWI) is as reliable as at the bank: payments are credited within a few minutes.” <br><br>  Here is such a “convenient service for paying for everyday services.” </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/91601/">https://habr.com/ru/post/91601/</a></p>
