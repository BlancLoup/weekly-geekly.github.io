Part 2: Hypotheses and Target Audience</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bf0/661/a3c/bf0661a3c1744c20945e49ae881d00de.png"><br><br>  In the <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/spagece/blog/21258/">last part,</a> we discussed what the landing pages are, the traffic and how these tools work.  In a nutshell, I remind you that a hypothesis is how you think, why you will be bought from you, the key phrase here is ‚ÄúYou think,‚Äù the surrounding reality does not agree. <br><br>  Hypotheses are very important.  They define your product, marketing, development strategy and ideas for growth.  So, we came up with a cool product or any business idea and begin to build a hypothesis.  I have such a product X (service, product, course ...) and will be bought by Y (grandmothers, directors, janitors, motorists ...), as it perfectly solves the Q problem (cooking dumplings, car repairs, gift delivery ...) because it is Z (better, faster, easier, cheaper, more convenient, more efficient ...).  We will analyze in more detail.

(Q)</strong> <br>  The first and most important thing is to solve the real problem of people.  Not a personal hallucination of the brain, that my product is very cool and everyone has such a problem, but a real problem.  The best way is to find potential customers, offer them an initial idea and understand whether it needs it or not.  If not, then look for other potential customers and ask again.  If more than 100 people were interviewed and no one needs it, then either nobody really needs it, or they are not looking there.  This is a separate big topic of conversation. <br><br>  <strong>Understand whom you will sell (Y)</strong> <br>  Who are your customers?  Elderly grandmothers or ugly macho?  Mommies with small children or directors?  Do they have much money or little?  Are there many or few?  Just about this second part of the article. <br><br>  <strong>Decide what you are selling?</strong>  <strong>(X, z)</strong> <br>  The same problem can be solved in different ways.  For example car repair.  You can open a car service and attract customers to it.  And you can send the master to the client, and he will repair the car on the spot.  The problem seems to be one, but the solution is different.  We need to sell to people what they need and what solves their problems, without their fantasies. <br><br>  It is important to be better than competitors.  Faster, easier, more efficient, more beautiful.  Ideally, of course, to be better at everything and this is what you should strive for.  But at the initial stage, it often turns out that you need to be at least something better, and the other parameters are the same.  Or just be different and stand out. <br><br>  <strong>Think of how?</strong> <br>  Think over the options of advertising channels through which you will sell.  These will be: social networks, contextual advertising, targeted advertising, teaser ads, word of mouth, virial effects.  There are hundreds of channels, they need to be tested and watched in each economy.  Determine which business and sales models you will use.  A good example of how to change the color market.  One company for repost records VKontakte or facebook sent absolutely for free 3 fresh beautiful roses.  It was necessary to enter only phone numbers to find the address where to deliver and call the one to whom they deliver.  You are called and offered to increase the number of roses to 10, 100, 1000 pieces.  Approximately 30% agree.  So you recruit a huge base for repeat sales, recoup advertising and free roses and earn.  Given the huge margin on flowers. <br><br>  <strong>Find out why and improve!</strong> <br>  Launch traffic to the site, make first sales, find out from customers why they buy, what they like and make them a better deal. <br><br>  To record information in a convenient and structured way, it is best to use smart cards or MindMap.  They build the right picture in the head, and they organize the information well in a visual form.  Try and immediately feel the advantages.  You can use the services or write on a piece of paper. <br><br>  <a href="https://coggle.it/">You can create a map for free on the service from Google&gt;</a> <br><ol><li>  Click "Sign Up" </li><li>  Register or login to your account. </li><li>  Click ‚ÄúCreate‚Äù </li></ol><br><br><h1>  <font color="#5b6166">Practical part</font> </h1><br><br>  Open the beginning of the practical part of the course.  All you need to do is highlighted in green.  Performing tasks will give real results by the end of the course. <br><br><blockquote>  <font color="#5bbd72">What to do:</font> <font color="#5bbd72"><br></font> <ul><li>  Write the question ‚ÄúWhat problem of the client do you solve?‚Äù To MindMap </li><li>  We are painting 3 answer options for your niche. </li></ul></blockquote><br>  Get something like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2dd/afc/537/2ddafc537dd54ba2987c920601d60014.png"><br><br><h1>  <font color="#5b6166">Determine the target audience (CA)</font> </h1><br><br>  Texts are boring, this is not a super interesting part of the process, but it is the one that gives the very result by which there are sales through one-page.  Want a result, write texts, a lot of texts!  Write yourself, because not a single copywriter will help you, because he does not know your clients.  The result will be better with each new line.  So we are arranged that we perceive information through the text.  A simple change of the title on the site can increase the conversion by 2 - 3 times.  How?  About this in the following sections. <br><br><h1>  <font color="#5b6166">Who needs a target audience?</font> </h1><br><br>  The target audience is a collective image of various groups of your potential buyers.  He is often called a character, avatar, type of target audience and much more.  Further everywhere we will call "avatar". <br><br>  Why do we need to research the target audience, and better to know it well?  If we know Central Asia, their language, their values, their desires, their motivation, their problems.  How they think and what they think.  Then we will be able to speak the same language with them, and therefore we will understand each other. <br><br><blockquote>  Understanding CA = Great Offer = Big Sales. <br></blockquote> <br><br>  You can press on the necessary values ‚Äã‚Äãand keys, offer the product in the form in which they need it, and they will buy it.  And not to reinvent the wheel and do blindly, as we like, trying to get a finger into the sky. <br><br>  Often a business does not hear the problems of people that it ‚Äúwants‚Äù to solve.  Hence the lack of sales.  People have a lot of problems and needs.  At the decision and satisfaction of which they want to spend money.  You just need to be close, stand out a bit and push the person to buy. <br><br>  Because even if you have a completely new and high-quality product, but nobody needs it, no one will buy it.  You open your business, but only because of this, customers will not queue up and will not incur their denyuzhku to you.  ‚ÄúLook, Vasya Pupkin sells knitted socks, well, the neighbors quickly get everything in line.‚Äù Sometimes you need to explain what problem the product solves, why it is needed, how it can make life better. <br><br>  Selling everything and everyone is not working for a long time.  Segment into narrow groups of clients, say specifically what you can do.  Tell us what a great specialist you are in one area.  Position yourself closer to the customer.  Create narrow niches to solve one problem.  So you will look like a professional in your business, and this will increase trust and sales. <br><br>  Imagine you need a wedding photographer.  To whom will you go?  For a single photographer, whose portfolio contains 100 weddings and he is professionally engaged only in shooting weddings for 10 years.  Or to a photographer who provides all types of photo services with the same experience. <br> <em><br></em>  <em>Examples:</em> <em><br></em>  <em>It is bad when everywhere, everything and for all.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>- Interior design.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>- Trainings for business.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>- Photography to order.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>Good</em> <em><br></em>  <em>- Interior design apartments in Moscow premium.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>- Training to increase sales by 2 times for owners of online stores.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>- Studio photography portfolio for models in St. Petersburg.</em> <em><br></em> <br><blockquote>  <font color="#5bbd72">What to do:</font> <font color="#5bbd72"><br></font> <ul><li>  Write a niche narrowly and specifically 3 options. </li><li>  Add to smart card (MindMap) </li></ul></blockquote><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/201/544/8a3/2015448a3ad04453b7aedcc9aa435391.png"><br><br>  There are two options to understand customers: <br><ol><li>  If you already have customers, then look who your customers are and ask them the right questions.  I think you yourself know what to ask.  But I will tell about them further. </li><li>  If there are no clients yet, it means that we use the technology of creating avatars. </li></ol><br><br><h1>  <font color="#5b6166">About the target audience in general</font> </h1><br><br>  It is necessary to accurately represent the head, and it is better to know in the face of their customers. <br><br>  <strong>Age.</strong>  Sell ‚Äã‚Äãto young people or retirees? <br>  <strong>Floor.</strong>  Is the product made for women only?  Or for men? <br>  <strong>Social and economic situation.</strong>  The teacher thinks differently than the principal, and the thinking of the office worker is different from the taxi driver. <br>  <strong>Education.</strong>  Real education and erudition, and not a diploma piece of paper, which now means little. <br>  <strong>Type of thinking.</strong>  People are traditional mentality, and there are rebels, geniuses, socially unadapted, introverts and extroverts who think specifically and theoretically, focused on the process or on the result, strategies and tactics, physics and lyricists, finally. <br>  <strong>Religion.</strong>  If you are going to sell pork in the Jewish quarter, this is probably not the best idea. <br>  <strong>Habits</strong>  Smoke or not?  Owls or larks?  Alone or in a relationship? <br>  Any other that is significant in this case. <br><br><h1>  <font color="#5b6166">Technology create avatars.</font>  <font color="#5b6166">We define their distinctive features.</font> </h1><br><br>  You need to understand very well.  Who are your customers and what they want.  How they choose a product in your niche.  Why they choose you.  Always try to take the place of the client and ask yourself the question: <strong>‚ÄúWho am I?‚Äù</strong> .  So you can at the first stage, at least approximately understand for what reasons and motives they buy, what criteria and properties they pay attention to.  So you will understand what texts to write and accordingly how to sell.  Of course it's easier when you already have customers and you can just ask them.  It is always better to ask others, this is more real information.  In any case, it will be a logical step to better understand and sell better. <br><br>  Focus groups, potential customer surveys, and all sorts of other polls, this is cool.  This is better than nothing.  But treat them with caution, as they do not give real information.  Yes, they certainly help to learn about what customers want, but not what will happen in reality. <br><br><blockquote>  There is a huge difference between a person who would like to buy and buy.  As long as a person doesn‚Äôt give real money for your product, he can tell a lot.  It's like comparing a monkey and a man.  It seems like the outside, but the brains are different. </blockquote><br><br>  Your business has several avatars.  They may be similar and may be completely different.  It is important to understand that different avatars have different needs, problems, tasks, goals, and motivation.  Therefore, each avatar needs to present information accordingly. <br><br>  If you can‚Äôt ask, the main task is to think about who can buy your product, who needs it, whose problems it can solve.  Find as many of these avatars as possible. <br><br>  <em>Suppose we want to sell cars, so our avatars, for example, might be:</em> <em><br></em> <ol><li>  <em>Family - take the child to kindergarten, wife to work, go to Mega or to the country at the weekend.</em> </li><li>  <em>A top manager is a status car with a price tag of $ 100,000.</em> </li><li>  <em>Taxi driver - a car is a means to work on the delivery of customers from point A to point B.</em> </li></ol> <em><br></em>  <em>Or for example you are engaged in doors, then avatars can be like this:</em> <em><br></em> <ol><li>  <em>Families doing now or planning repairs.</em> </li><li>  <em>Designers of apartments and cottages that can install doors from your catalog into projects.</em> </li><li>  <em>Companies participating in tenders for interior decoration of buildings.</em> </li></ol><br>  Sometimes you can find dozens of such types, sometimes only a few, it all depends on the business niche. <br><blockquote>  <font color="#5bbd72">What to do:</font> <font color="#5bbd72"><br></font> <ol><li>  Write 5 different avatars for your niche.  (Who is your client?) </li><li>  Add to smart card </li></ol></blockquote><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/78b/a6d/c8f/78ba6dc8fc464a6aa5db785348d7d589.png"><br><br>  In the next article I will tell you how to identify customer needs and determine values ‚Äã‚Äãand benefits for them. <br><br>  Was the article helpful? <br>  Tell about us in social networks and add to favorites so you don‚Äôt lose.  This is the biggest thanks! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296850/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296850/</a></p>
