      Mastering the console is a real pleasure.  The feeling that all control over the system is in one line gives confidence.  You feel that the system does not force you to unnecessary clicks, dragging windows, pressing the nekst.  It is enough for you to say - and she will hear (the main thing is correct to say).  And that all the programs are in the same place and you do not need to dig the Internet in search of serials and updates - this is generally a miracle.  Having studied all the available distributions, I started not from designer (all the same weekend), but from multimedia, I came across as real stars (in front of which the windows look like windows) and ran into (so far) unsolved difficulties.  So, everything is in order. <br><br>  As an incurable music fan, he began experiments with music. <a name="habracut"></a>  The first trouble was that the mp3-shki refused to start (and this is Ubuntu with a bunch of software on the DVD), I certainly understand that most here are familiar with the fact that such ‚Äúbad‚Äù in mp3 and why Linux doesn‚Äôt like it, but for the average student This is a secret behind seven seals, and he is unlikely to be glad that after clicking on a music file, the music from the speakers is not heard ... And it‚Äôs suggested to download the codec.  Somehow not ‚Äúuser-friendly‚Äù, as one of those who commented on the previous post managed to express.  (I wonder if there are statistics, how many sound recordings of the world in percentage ratio are in mp3 format.) Well, download it and download it.  By the way, ogg and flac reproduced immediately.  I heard somewhere that these codecs even have the best sound, despite being free. <br><br>  The boxed player was neither pleased with the originality nor the amenities.  But it loaded faster than Aytyuns, Windows Media and even faster than the last Winamp.  One gets the feeling that the whole system began to react much more vigorously.  The choice stopped on the player Amorok.  IMHO so many functions stuff in such an intuitive and user-friendly interface is just a feat.  I will not talk about him for a long time, but I can only say that in a few hours he went through 250 GB of music on a remote screw, picked up the covers almost without interference, wrote down tags and chopped up a hundred playlists of any choice and ipod. <br>  A little reminder of the ipod - it seemed to me - the player connects normally to Amorok (ku) if only he lived with Aytunz before, apparently Winamp makes some of his tricks with the player that Amoroc hasn't been reported on. <br><br>  The user's desire is the law, and he wants to watch a movie.  What did not download (different players, all kinds of codecs), but the problem is the same with all types of video (DVD, mpeg4, avi) - the picture is not shown in the player window, but for some reason, crawls on navigation, and when you try go to fullscreen - the screen is covered with artifacts and window tails.  At the moment this is one of the most depressing unsolved problems.  So if someone had this and you know how it is treated - share, please. <br><br>  Next - view photos and pictures.  Everything is almost perfect here - the internal viewer is cheerful and pretty.  That's just with fullscreen and then flaws.  In fullscreen mode, a rather wide panel with navigation buttons remains at the top.  Nowhere to put it-hide its obvious possibility is not available.  The picture is normal for the whole screen not to look. But I have a fullscreen mode.  Strange ... or am I doing something wrong? <br>  For cataloging, downloading photos from the camera and eye manipulations, like a true Gugelyanets, put Picas.  It works faster than on the same machine with Windows.  In addition to one little trouble: Linux version for some reason does not support folders in Russian.  Again, strange ... <br><br>  I also felt an acute need for small utilities, which I could not find analogues.  Maybe someone has: <br><br>  1) Piece for auto-switching layouts ala Putno Switcher. <br>  2) A utility for recording all keyboard actions, (Very handy when you forget to save a file or accidentally press the wrong button) <br><br>  I would also like to ask for advice on a convenient GTD for Ubunt. <br><br>  Positive: a very nice font smoothing system, it is now much easier to read from the screen, and even to the reaction speed !, and of course freely scalable icons - this is almost ingenious.  (svg?) <br><br>  Now I listen to music, but I don‚Äôt watch cinema, I began to sort it out in Gimp and Inscipe - I learned a lot about my stuck interface habits.  But more about that another time.  Still, you will not become an Ubuntarian overnight. <br><br>  Hi, Ubuntu, they say you are user friendly.  Lie? <br>  No, they do not lie ... They fantasize at their leisure. <br><br>  Cross-post from <a href="http://alisheryakupov.blogspot.com/2007/10/blog-post_22.html">User Friendly blog</a> <a href="http://alisheryakupov.blogspot.com/2007/10/blog-post_22.html"><br></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/15268/">https://habr.com/ru/post/15268/</a></p>
