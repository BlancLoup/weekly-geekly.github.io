Interview with Misha Denisov and Yulya Basyrova</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5c3/c86/48c/5c3c8648cc72cf5c26a6bbc98f0439a1.jpg" alt="image" align="left"><br>  Today we will talk about the wonderful <a href="http://mdday.ru/">Mobile Developer Day</a> event - a series of meetings for mobile application developers and sympathizers, taking place in different cities of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus.  We will not stretch the introduction and immediately proceed to a conversation with the creator of MDDay, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/mishkins.denisov">Misha Denisov,</a> and his charming assistant <a href="http://www.facebook.com/ybasyrova">Julia Basyrova</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Question one: how long have you been, how did the idea come about, how did it all start?</b> <br><br>  <b>Misha:</b> We held the first festival for mobile developers near Nizhny Novgorod in the early autumn of 2009. Then we made our own project - a service for mobile devices (then on java) - and were puzzled by porting to iOS.  Events for mobile applications at that time was not as a class.  Then we decided to hold our own - Mobilefest.  It was a glorious time when the event should be called ‚Äúabout mobile development‚Äù - and it was already a must visit.  More than 200 people from different regions, including those from the Baltic States, came to Nizhny.  In 2010, we repeated - in the same place at the same time - and went well again.  We tried to create an atmosphere so that even the hint was not a boring event for nerds.  Although pay attention, there are not so many classic nerds in mobile.  At Mobilefest, in addition to the halls for seminars, which are often non-standard (for example, hookah or wigwam), the stage is surely staged and musicians perform.  Often a sound check begins even before the last speaker utters the last phrase. <br>  We had friends, regular participants, and we decided to try to make the event closer to the people, or farther from the people - as anyone.  That is, in Moscow.  In December 2010, we held the first Mobile Developer Day in the still unrepaired premises of the HSE Cultural Center.  These are 2 halls and a hall - a space that seats up to 700 people.  And the participants came and talked, and it was good.

      <b>How did you define your audience?</b>  <b>Did your expectations differ greatly from what came out of the result?</b>  <b>Who comes to you?</b> <br><br>  <b>Misha:</b> Our audience is those who need something from this life, it is interesting for them to create, form new markets. <br><br>  <b>Yulia:</b> People come with different backgrounds - industry experts, and young developers who are just starting their mobile business.  But they are all open to communication, the exchange of information and ideas.  For many, such events become a turning point - someone literally gets a job at a conference, and someone, inspired, begins to develop his project.  We have a lot of such stories. <br><br>  <b>You hold events in various cities, not only in Russia.</b>  <b>Why is that?</b>  <b>Do you like to travel?</b> <br><br>  <b>Misha:</b> Yes, we love traveling and developers.  Two in one. <br><br>  <b>Yulia:</b> In addition, the wide geography of events allows us to see a more complete picture of the market - what are the minds of developers in one place, what is in demand in another, what they are working in the third. <br><br>  <b>In which cities have you been, in which would you like to hold events in the future?</b> <br><br>  <b>Yulia:</b> Most of the events take place in Moscow, St. Petersburg and Nizhny Novgorod, but the last summer was particularly ‚Äútraveling‚Äù - Minsk, Odessa.  Next year we plan to hold a conference in Europe, and in Russia, Kazan, Yekaterinburg and Novosibirsk are next in line. <br><br>  <b>How do you pick the speakers?</b>  <b>Are there any clear selection criteria?</b> <br><br>  <b>Misha: The</b> speaker should do something, something to share.  We do not like marketing presentations, the ‚Äúraw‚Äù report is closer to us - but the one who tells something useful from his experience with glowing eyes, let him stammer or blush. <br><br>  <b>How do you plan to develop: to continue in the same spirit and improve or gradually change the format?</b> <br><br>  <b>Misha:</b> We will add new formats and adjust the current ones.  The market is changing, changing requirements.  We are already preparing a few surprises. <br><br>  <b>AppProfessionals.ru is a tool for choosing a reliable partner for developing applications.</b> <br><br>  The service allows customers looking for a mobile application developer to choose a partner based on the required competencies, geographical location, portfolio and average cost of work.  Developers, accordingly, will be able to find customers here.  Sign up! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/156707/">https://habr.com/ru/post/156707/</a></p>
