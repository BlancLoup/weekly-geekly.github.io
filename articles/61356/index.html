The mysteries of its origin are covered with darkness, but until now it has only come to me in the “cardinal” sense. </li><li>  <b>General</b> <b><br></b>  <b>In general</b> <br>  Another couple of mutant brothers, this time from the union <a href="http://gramota.ru/slovari/dic/%3Flop%3Dx%26efr%3Dx%26zar%3Dx%26ag%3Dx%26ab%3Dx%26sin%3Dx%26lv%3Dx%26az%3Dx%26pe%3Dx%26word%3D%25E2%25EE%25EE%25E1%25F9%25E5"><strong><em>in general</em></strong></a> and <a href="http://gramota.ru/slovari/dic/%3Flop%3Dx%26efr%3Dx%26zar%3Dx%26ag%3Dx%26ab%3Dx%26sin%3Dx%26lv%3Dx%26az%3Dx%26pe%3Dx%26word%3D%25E2%2B%25EE%25E1%25F9%25E5%25EC"><strong><em>in general</em></strong></a> . </li><li>  <b>Hladogen</b> <br>  The parents of this offspring are not known for certain.

There is an assumption that this is <a href="http://gramota.ru/slovari/dic/%3Flop%3Dx%26efr%3Dx%26zar%3Dx%26ag%3Dx%26ab%3Dx%26sin%3Dx%26lv%3Dx%26az%3Dx%26pe%3Dx%26word%3D%25E3%25E0%25EB%25EE%25E3%25E5%25ED"><strong><em>halogen</em></strong></a> , but he denies his involvement in every way. </li><li>  <b>Too much</b> <br>  Every time I see this spelling of a word <a href="http://gramota.ru/slovari/dic/%3Flop%3Dx%26efr%3Dx%26zar%3Dx%26ag%3Dx%26ab%3Dx%26sin%3Dx%26lv%3Dx%26az%3Dx%26pe%3Dx%26word%3D%25F7%25E5%25F0%25E5%25F1%25F7%25F3%25F0"><strong><em>too much</em></strong></a> , it tempts me to ask: <i>what</i> churs and who are those churs? <br>  <i><b>UPD:</b> As comrade <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/msapiens/" class="user_link">msapiens</a> informed me in the comments, “chury” -that exist.</i>  <i>Moreover, as it turned out, the word “too much” originated precisely from the outdated “through chur”, where the word “chur” is used in the sense of “edge”, “edge”.</i>  <i>Nevertheless, in the modern language this meaning of this word has already been almost forgotten, and the word “too” has become independent, is written together and through “c”.</i>  <i>I'm not talking about the fact that it is unlikely that the majority of authors of “over the mouth” use such a spelling meaningfully, knowing the origin of this word.</i>  <i>;-)</i> </li><li>  <b>To article</b> <b><br></b>  <b>By the way</b> <br>  If it were a word about <a href="http://gramota.ru/slovari/dic/%3Flop%3Dx%26efr%3Dx%26zar%3Dx%26ag%3Dx%26ab%3Dx%26sin%3Dx%26lv%3Dx%26az%3Dx%26pe%3Dx%26word%3D%25F1%25F2%25E0%25F2%25FC"><strong><em>becoming</em></strong></a> (aka physique), then the second of the options mentioned might be appropriate.  But usually this is just the wrong spelling of the word by the <a href="http://gramota.ru/slovari/dic/%3Flop%3Dx%26efr%3Dx%26zar%3Dx%26ag%3Dx%26ab%3Dx%26sin%3Dx%26lv%3Dx%26az%3Dx%26pe%3Dx%26word%3D%25EA%25F1%25F2%25E0%25F2%25E8"><strong><em>way</em></strong></a> .  Sometimes there is also a hybrid version by the <b>way</b> . </li><li>  <b>Future</b> <br>  How the word <a href="http://gramota.ru/slovari/dic/%3Flop%3Dx%26efr%3Dx%26zar%3Dx%26ag%3Dx%26ab%3Dx%26sin%3Dx%26lv%3Dx%26az%3Dx%26pe%3Dx%26word%3D%25E1%25F3%25E4%25F3%25F9%25E8%25E9"><strong><em>future</em></strong></a> turned into this freak, a mystery to me.  Is that from a symbiosis with the word "blowing" ... </li><li>  <b>Thanks in advance</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Thanks in advance</b> <br>  You can give thanks <i>for something</i> specific.  If someone gave you something called the word “ <i>earlier</i> ” (or “ <i>early</i> ”), gratitude for this action could be expressed by just such a phrase as stated above.  And if the gratitude is made in advance, previously, then the word <a href="http://gramota.ru/slovari/dic/%3Flop%3Dx%26efr%3Dx%26zar%3Dx%26ag%3Dx%26ab%3Dx%26sin%3Dx%26lv%3Dx%26az%3Dx%26pe%3Dx%26word%3D%25E7%25E0%25F0%25E0%25ED%25E5%25E5"><strong><em>is</em></strong></a> written <a href="http://gramota.ru/slovari/dic/%3Flop%3Dx%26efr%3Dx%26zar%3Dx%26ag%3Dx%26ab%3Dx%26sin%3Dx%26lv%3Dx%26az%3Dx%26pe%3Dx%26word%3D%25E7%25E0%25F0%25E0%25ED%25E5%25E5"><strong><em>in advance</em></strong></a> together and through "e".  (The “Thank you for early apples” option is also possible.) </li><li>  <b>Theirs</b> <br>  Perhaps the only word from the entire list here, which is often used intentionally, to dilute an overly serious text in a deliberately colloquial, colloquial vocabulary.  However, according to the rules of the Russian language correctly speak <a href="http://gramota.ru/slovari/dic/%3Flop%3Dx%26efr%3Dx%26zar%3Dx%26ag%3Dx%26ab%3Dx%26sin%3Dx%26lv%3Dx%26az%3Dx%26pe%3Dx%26word%3D%25E8%25F5"><strong><em>them</em></strong></a> . </li><li>  <b>Scam</b> <br>  A direct consequence of the desire of certain individuals to destroy the letter "e" wherever its replacement "e" does not cause ambiguities.  The word <a href="http://gramota.ru/slovari/dic/%3Flop%3Dx%26efr%3Dx%26zar%3Dx%26ag%3Dx%26ab%3Dx%26sin%3Dx%26lv%3Dx%26az%3Dx%26pe%3Dx%26word%3D%25E0%25F4%25E5%25F0%25E0"><strong><em>scam</em></strong></a> is written and read through the "e", and not through the "e"!  If “” was written everywhere, and not only where it would be desirable, then everyone would read the word “scam” correctly, and so many assume that there is the letter “” replaced by “e”. </li><li>  <b>According to something</b> <br>  Illiterate clerical turnover.  It is correct to speak <a href="http://gramota.ru/slovari/dic/%3Flop%3Dx%26efr%3Dx%26zar%3Dx%26ag%3Dx%26ab%3Dx%26sin%3Dx%26lv%3Dx%26az%3Dx%26pe%3Dx%26word%3D%25F1%25EE%25E3%25EB%25E0%25F1%25ED%25EE"><strong><em>according to something</em></strong></a> (but: “agrees with point N of something,” because here “something” is already associated with the word “point”). </li><li>  <b>My birthday</b> <br>  Once a year there is such a <b>day</b> : when you were born.  And this <b>day</b> is called <a href="http://gramota.ru/slovari/dic/%3Flop%3Dx%26efr%3Dx%26zar%3Dx%26ag%3Dx%26ab%3Dx%26sin%3Dx%26lv%3Dx%26az%3Dx%26pe%3Dx%26word%3D%25E4%25E5%25ED%25FC%2B%25F0%25EE%25E6%25E4%25E5%25ED%25E8%25FF"><strong><em>birthday</em></strong></a> .  And since this is still a “day,” it is “mine,” and not “mine.” </li><li>  <b>Opening the door, she squeaked loudly.</b> <br>  The question of backfilling: who creaked - the door or person who opened this door?  It is a very common mistake when they do not follow the coordination of objects and receive similar idiocy (and even worse) ... </li><li>  <b>Verbs on -tya</b> <br>  Yes, I know that there are a lot of rules in Russian, that they are complex, tangled, that they are difficult to remember and even harder to understand ... But the rule of using forms of verbs for-e / y is one of the simplest (if not the simplest) !  Just ask a question to this verb.  If there is a soft sign in the question, it will be in the verb, no — then no: <ol><li>  “I'm starting (what are you doing?) Getting <u>together</u> .” </li><li>  "He (what's up?) Is going to." </li></ol>  There is another, perhaps even easier way to check: just throw away the suffix "Xia": <ol><li>  “I want to learn.  → I want to learn. " </li><li>  "He's washing the face."  → He's washing his face. ” </li></ol></li></ul><br><br>  PS: I don’t know if it makes sense to transfer to “I am writing correctly.”  On the one hand, the post is directly related to this blog.  On the other hand, the selection is extremely subjective and almost unstructured ... <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> Transferred.
