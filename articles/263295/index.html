      It is difficult to imagine medium and large businesses that operate without any IT systems.  Of course, he cannot do without IT specialists: from a system administrator to a director of technology.  The classic perception of the work of these people - they make it so that everything works with us: they buy equipment, they customize everything and solve everyday problems. <br><br>  Few people think that information technology is a full-fledged part of a business that (like any other areas) is amenable to planning and is even very well suited for this.  Managers often miss this moment when they think about the work of the internal IT service, therefore, as such, development does not occur due to proper planning. <br><br>  <a href="http://it-grad.ru/iaas/iaas-vmware/virtual-infrastructure/">Virtual infrastructure</a> is an excellent tool for the rapid and flexible scaling of IT systems, the realization of experimental development and savings in general.  With the right approach, it allows the company to invest time in the root tasks of the business and think about how to develop it from a strategic point of view. <br><br>  This is often not enough for IT professionals working in the staff of the most ordinary company: from digital-agency to the bank.  One of the reasons for changing the employer in such a situation is the oversupply of ‚Äúdirty work‚Äù in the constant maintenance of workplaces, the rebuilding of servers and the laying of communications in the office.  From this work does not go away, but there are few who would argue with the fact that all this does not look so attractive for a modern IT specialist. <br><br>  Working with IaaS allows you to give most of the official tasks to the outside.  Thus, employees can already do something more interesting and think about how to grow your business and choose the right tools, and not just ‚Äúpatch holes‚Äù when something breaks in the office. <br><br><blockquote>  Prototypes of future versions and running-in of new functions often require separate stands of similar performance, and we recall with a shudder the self-assembly ‚Äúservers‚Äù and the nightly work on their engraftment. <br><br>  Progress here, of course, relaxes: clicked the mouse and got the whole farm under test.  At the same time, it is not necessary to go to the management for a budget for test iron, and later - to think about where to put obsolete decommissioned equipment.  Beauty. <br><br>  - Hotels.ru project team <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/it-grad/blog/258389/">about working with IaaS-cloud</a> </blockquote><br>  Another view from PickPoint, which is an active IaaS <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/it-grad/blog/262859">user</a> : <br><br><blockquote>  When it all started, server hardware was borrowed for economy.  But we quickly came up against the ceiling of its capabilities, and the growth of the load was hardly predictable due to the novelty of the idea on the domestic market. <br><br>  Namayavshis with a constant upgrade of iron, we decided not to pour from empty to empty and turned to cloud technologies. </blockquote><br>  As a result, there are a number of advantages: <br><br><ul><li>  revision of business processes in the direction of accelerating development and improving efficiency; </li><li>  fewer approvals for the purchase of own equipment and enterprise solutions; </li><li>  lack of capital costs for the purchase of equipment; </li><li>  lack of labor for deployment and configuration; </li><li>  instant access to any storage volumes; </li><li>  no need to account for depreciation. </li></ul><br>  In addition, it is worth noting the overall maturity of the market IaaS-providers.  Today, there is no situation where one provider provides only a part of services, and everything else needs to be reached somewhere else.  The main thing is that the provider has accumulated expertise and resources to maintain a high level of knowledge in working with equipment and software solutions. <br><br>  In order to still ‚Äúmove to the cloud‚Äù without extra labor costs, it is worth considering the introduction of ITIL + ITSM standards, clarifying SLA at the provider level and compliance with Tier standards.  The choice of service provider depends on the business model of the customer‚Äôs company itself - for the relevant tasks it is necessary to use the required cloud solution model: SaaS, IaaS, PaaS.  The simplest solution is to look at those companies that already cooperate with one or another provider and compare their business model with theirs. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/263295/">https://habr.com/ru/post/263295/</a></p>
