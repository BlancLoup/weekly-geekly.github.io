Began to choose among 12-13 inches.  Monitoring of our stores gave some information, there were three models of different brands that we were satisfied with - Dell, Samsung and Acer like.  For various reasons, I stopped at the Dell, model XPS m1330.  Paid by bank transfer, received documents and equipment.  Everything went well.  The purchase was made at Sunrise chain store in November 2008. In the meantime, the crisis has done its job with the store not suffering from the influx of customers, and the Togliatti store has closed.  The closest to Samara (about 100 km). <br><br><h4>  Breakdown </h4>

      Somewhere in October, the laptop began to break - problems with the video card - the screen became dark during operation, and slightly noticeable dark green vertical stripes appeared.  The book is still under warranty - not a problem, I thought, and began to communicate with the Sunrise service.  They first say that I was taking to the official SC.  Further, for unknown reasons, the screw burned. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Service center </h4><br><br>  I didn‚Äôt really want to go to another city - we decided to quietly repair in Togliatti.  They took me to the service they pointed out to us in Sunrise, they said that there are different suppliers, we are repairing some of them, others are being repaired from others, we need to punch, leave, we will check, call then.  They accepted the beech readily, and, as I understood it, were interested in repairs.  After a couple of days of contact, they say: "We need to change the motherboard and screw."  But!  Firstly, the supplier turned out to be not theirs, and, in general, Dell has rules for expiration of a guarantee after some time from the date of production (the SC said, as it turned out later not quite right), therefore, the repair should be carried out by the store, Dell refuses, they refused to give out any papers in the SC, I didn‚Äôt particularly insist, not quite understanding what I could demand from them. <br><br><h4>  Shop, Samara </h4><br><br>  So I had to go to Samara.  Before that, he studied ZoZPP, civil code.  As a legal person bought by bank transfer, we no longer become consumers and ZOZPP does not act on us (they say that sometimes it can be proved in court the opposite).  Understanding this, for some reason, I made a claim on the basis of ZOZPP, which the store did not accept.  But the civil code has not been canceled, the seller is obliged to eliminate the problem for free.  Arrived - we are sent to the SC, go there, the SC is written in the guarantor and does not care.  At the same time, the laptop was examined, unfortunately, the defect turned out to be floating, their screen turned on perfectly.  The screw did not work.  I try to explain what was not accepted in the SC and why, it requires a piece of paper from the SC.  It turns out, as I understand it, the eldest, I explain the situation to him, he calls up the Samara SC, they tell him that he has such a rule, but if there are documents confirming the purchase, they are ready to carry out the repair.  The case moved, we have documents with us, they give us the address, they explain how to get there. <br><br><h4>  Dell </h4><br><br>  I remember about another Tolyatti SC, I don‚Äôt really want to pick up a beech, I recognize the telephone of this service, I call them, I‚Äôll find out if they are ready to repair it for free - they say, take it, we have to break through the Service tag to Dell, everything depends on them .  In the same place, I learn that I can punch myself into the hotline at 8-800 ... by the service tag.  Dell saves on the service desk, calls to this number are free only from stationary phones, what's the problem with mobiles and why others don‚Äôt have them?  Knowing that the journey through the menu and listening to classical and not so much music while waiting for the operator‚Äôs response can be delayed, and not understanding how much a minute of such a conversation will cost, I find the phone (I had to go to the corporate department).  I call, connect with the operator and find out a very interesting thing! <br>  Warranty for this particular beech Dell did not give NEVER !!!  Pay for the repair of this beech Dell will NOT.  Under the contract with the distributor.  All claims to the store. <br><br><h4>  Shop again </h4><br><br>  I come back, telling them this news.  They are removed for discussion.  It turns out: ‚ÄúWe have three options for you, or we put a screw and we diverge, since the defect with the screen did not manifest itself.  The second option, we can change your book to a different one.  For example, a beautiful Dell, almost the same, it was not at all a boo, it was just being repaired.  Shows something huge in size from cheap gray plastic.  Well, the third option - give the diagnosis.  We will check you call. "  Naturally, I choose the third option, let it be checked, it may still manifest itself, or else I cannot go back without repairing it, and even the guarantee comes to an end.  Please write in the coupon about the defect, the inspector argued with me for a long time that he did not see the defect, but in the end he wrote with the wording "According to the buyer ...".  We hand over a beech.  We are leaving. <br><br><h4>  Second visit </h4><br><br>  A few days later they call, saying that the screw is faulty, a burning smell is detected, the defect did not show up in the video.  We take the time to go, pick up.  We arrive, pick up a beech, it is written about the fire in the act and ‚Äúin accordance with section No. 3 of the warranty card, the defect cannot be repaired under warranty‚Äù.  In the third section there are 11 points, please indicate which one, the person behind the counter: "Read, everything is written there."  I am trying to convey to him that in the third section there are fires and floods, and there are misuse and nine more points, what exactly do you mean?  As a result, he found a clause in which it is written: "The product has pronounced mechanical and / or electrical damage resulting from any actions by the buyer or third parties." <br><br>  I decide that it is useless to argue here - I ask you to issue a piece of paper that we took the beech today, November 27th. <br>  - We are not giving out. <br>  - But what about the extension of the guarantee? <br>  - The warranty is extended in case of repair, there was no repair - the warranty is not extended. <br>  - The warranty is extended for the duration of the repair. <br><br>  Rummaged in the computer found an act of acceptance of the work performed, signs, puts the stamp "Department of warranty service."  On a piece of paper there is not even the name of the organization, I indicate this, please put a regular round stamp. <br>  - We do not put such, we do not have this. <br>  - Call who puts. <br>  - Here is the administrator behind the wall, to him all the questions. <br><br>  The administrator, having learned that we send the legal entity to the corporate department, put a round stamp with the name of the organization for the documents.  I come, everywhere I write that I have a claim to the quality of repair, the reason for the refusal is not clear.  I take the beech, the documents are leaving. <br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br><br>  1. What to do next, do not know yet.  To begin with, we will write a complaint, let them write an official response with a reason for refusal, I don‚Äôt want to go there to them any more, as well as to buy something, even if they stayed with us.  Tell me who faced.  What does their item mean?  I turn on the beech in the socket, it lights up - I remain without a guarantee, since the product is damaged due to the buyer's action.  %) <br><br>  Under the guarantee, the book was acquired on documents on November 17, 2008, on November 11, 2009 was handed over to them, 1 year warranty.  As I understand it, the warranty must be extended.  Moreover, since they wrote that the beech is faulty, the guarantee is not going accordingly, since the product is faulty. <br><br>  2. Bold minus della.  It turns out their nameplate on the product does not mean anything.  I knew before that the assembly of almost all beeches took place at several factories in Southeast Asia.  It turned out that the manufacturer does not always give guarantees on their crafts.  I‚Äôll now have a watchful attitude to Dell‚Äôs products.  Question to employees of computer stores and SC: what other manufacturers can supply goods without a guarantee?  Experience shows that it is much easier to communicate with the official service center than with the sellers, especially if you can call 8-800 directly from the service ... (For example, Samsung works very well with its SC).  Another question: when buying, we were given a Dellovsky guarantee, it turns out we were misled, can we demand anything on this basis? <br><br>  3. If you are a small organization and make a small purchase - buy for cash, as an individual and report as you have taken.  But your relationship with the seller will fall under the ZOZPP that greatly facilitate your life. <br><br>  How it all ends - I will write it off.  Repair at your own expense will not ruin us.  But I hope for a successful resolution of the problem. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> Transferred to the blog Consumer Protection, although the legal entity is usually not recognized as such. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/76632/">https://habr.com/ru/post/76632/</a></p>
