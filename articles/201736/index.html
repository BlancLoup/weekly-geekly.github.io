To be honest, you do not know which one to write about first.  They are really a lot, and many of them are worthy of publicity.  Today I want to stop our attention on the project After Reset.  I also thought that it would be good practice to interview the developer, if possible with exclusive materials.  After all, Habr, the largest Russian IT resource, how can we manage without rare artifacts?

The claim is serious enough to be in doubt.  And I doubted.  And do not hesitate about it.  I doubt, by the way, even after I got acquainted with rare publications in the network, videos, and even pursued a build for the press (screenshots were taken from this version).  Looks like a dish perfectly.  Especially against the background of the <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/inxile/wasteland-2">Desert Hamburger</a> .  Where do doubts come from? <br><br>  Without agitating or crushing, I propose to go the usual way.  Armed with shoulder blades, examine the issue in more detail.  Read about the project, read the interview with the developer, watch exclusive screenshots, watch the video and decide on your own.  Believe it or not. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/064/1cf/bc5/0641cfbc58d6ebad1228a6a2bcc5e86b.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/080/1be/c6f/0801bec6f185655dfca6e857d834fd25.jpg"><br><br>  Doubts.  Imagine ... you went to a sushi bar (or to any other place, with any other, but surely your favorite food), and, having gotten into the hands of the menu, jumped up to the ceiling?  For cheap.  Assuming a day of discounts or any action, you try the dish.  Yummy.  Where is the damn catch?  After all, experience obligingly suggests that there is always a trick. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/da4/a04/d3f/da4a04d3f285f43a7954e9b441233ab3.jpg"><br>  <i><b>Original:</b> <a href="">click</a></i> <i><br></i>  <i>Here take any object, and fractions.</i>  <i>If you succeed.</i>  <i>Because everyone is done right.</i>  <i>This content has not touched the hand optimization.</i>  <i>He is handsome, detailed and attractive.</i>  <i>So it should look like pre-alpha so that you will not be told in other departments.</i> <br><br>  Most recently, I have not had access to internal materials, I have only heard the words and smiled.  Then I saw screenshots, and a skeptical smile changed color to warm.  Then I saw the video.  He whistled and apparently for this ‚Äúwhistle‚Äù got access to the closed demo version.  Now I see that the words, which at first made me skeptical smile, are supported by deed.  What after lunch?  I still doubt, but already believe.  Believe it or not, you are ... that is the question.  All I can do is try to provide you with reliable information. <br><br>  This story began for me quite a long time ago.  As you know, during the Wasteland 2 campaign on KS, I had a little fun in the field of creativity, and drew a <a href="http://www.lionwood-studios.com/special_for_brian_fargo.html">heap of pictures</a> , which is why all kinds of people still come to me on various issues.  Someone likes what I do, some people don‚Äôt like it.  Someone needs a consultation, someone has a technical question, and someone comes to say thank you. <br><br>  When the character under the pseudonym "Mr. Nixon" knocked on Skype with me, I strongly doubted that something worthwhile would come out for us.  Do not misunderstand me.  Fallout, the post-apocalyptic setting, is another isometric RPG, with a bunch of features from which hair stands on end even for a seasoned player.  Would you believe? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/426/bae/58e/426bae58e8e9932a06e3efe0292b518b.jpg"><br>  <i><b>Original:</b> <a href="">click</a></i> <i><br></i>  <i>I like to walk, you know, in search of "shoals".</i>  <i>But in this demo, the case is limited only to the clatter of the language and long-term gazing.</i>  <i>Attempts to dig something led me to the following discoveries (see the next. Image)</i> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">(the rest of the concerns under the spoiler, since the publication suddenly turned out huge)</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  That here and so from the bay-floundering, for no reason at all a game appears claiming at once to several fields firmly occupied by ancient games.  That promises to follow traditions will sound and to return to us that gold and hardcore that was lost many centuries ago.  Have we not heard this a thousand times?  Well, isn't that doubtful?  After all the truth?  What a sin to conceal, I also dream of making a post-apocalyptic rpg, and therefore ... doubtful.  Immediately.  Unconditionally.  It is doubtful!  And it would be completely so if not the materials accompanying this potentially good game. <br><br>  I have no doubt that Brian Fargo is already biting, if not his elbows, then certainly his lips at the sight of the first After Reset screenshots.  Yes, this is just an envirment of screenshots, yes, for the time being, the cat cried for the characters, the interface is not there yet, but how is everything served?  Already at the start of the fundraising campaign there are very solid materials.  Not just a video with screenshots cutting, but an action in motion, where you can immediately see how detailed and with what love the work was done on this wasteland. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a09/1cc/3dc/a091cc3dcdeb4c7da3795fc69f96348c.jpg"><br>  <i><b>Original:</b> <a href="">click</a></i> <i><br></i>  <i>The camera easily illustrates to us how detailed the content is.</i>  <i>This, I'm sorry, the level of first-person shooter, you can safely lower the camera and enjoy a beautiful picture.</i> <br><br>  I didn‚Äôt like the way the game was presented, because, to put it mildly, I don‚Äôt really like borrowing from other games.  But as I studied the promotional materials, my eyebrows dissatisfied on the bridge of my nose smoothed out.  Because‚Ä¶ <br><br>  Let us ask a question.  What is most important?  Words or deeds?  Of all the options not offered, I‚Äôll choose what the words are on the drum, the main thing is to be on.  Perpendicularly, who and what said, if in the end all the same it turned out the inhabitants of the Island were sheathed with pink foil.  Fully parallel, who and how much spent, if the road, in the end, blocked Thoroughly Tired and useless. <br>  What counts is not the words, not the regalia and not the size of the purses filled or devastated, not faceless percentages, not hateful slogans and not wittyly wrapped slogans.  Always and everywhere they measure us with our deeds. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ce8/677/cba/ce8677cbaf0bc5a164dde1fa3ec5da04.jpg"><br>  <i><b>Original:</b> <a href="">click</a></i> <i><br></i>  <i>Sorry, dear developers, I couldn‚Äôt resist the temptation to find an inconvenient camera angle and ... "catch a cap."</i>  <i>What can I say ... I'm impressed.</i>  <i>Someone would say that this is an insane expenditure of the budget, and I will answer that this is a love for the subject.</i>  <i>And the budget, as such, the game does not.</i>  <i>The developer does it himself, at his own peril and risk.</i>  <i>That is why it is invested in its own business, not in the way it is customary in large offices.</i>  <i>And with feeling.</i>  <i>Enough to notice it, and not to miss it.</i> <br><br></div></div><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ffd/292/fbd/ffd292fbd266b58594afe361d3db0b28.jpg"><br>  When I have questions, I go and ask them to who their source is.  In this case, it is a developer.  He must dispel my doubts.  He must calm me down.  And therefore we interview him. <br><br>  <i><b>Weilard:</b> Introduce <b>yourself</b> , please.</i>  <i>I understand that the question is boring, standard, but I think it would be interesting for the public to find out where you were born, what you did before After Reset, where you worked before, where you work now, and how you got into the gaming industry.</i>  <i>All this in detail, starting with the name.</i> <br>  <b>Richard:</b> My name is Richard.  He was born in the USSR, served in the Flight Control Center (of course, up to GLONAS).  He worked in the MBA UK with accreditation in Pleschka.  Independently built my own furniture business.  "Sawed" After Reset as a hobby.  I waited for a normal Fallout 3, but alas ... I did not wait, I had to take on the business myself. <br><br>  <i><b>Weilard:</b> How and when did you decide to associate yourself with the gaming industry.</i>  <i>When did it happen?</i>  <i>Since when did your work in game development start?</i> <br>  <b>Richard:</b> In the full understanding of this word, I don‚Äôt have a job in the gaming industry.  Five years ago, when DM'stvo grew on the servers of Neverwinter Nights, he started creating his worlds on the Aurora engine.  As a DM, being invisible to players and reviving the world around them, I watched dozens and hundreds of lives intertwined in an amazing way and floated through the waves of plots ... plots lined up for players.  It is very tightened, much more than to play yourself.  ‚ÄúIndustry‚Äù is a business.  My business is different ... wooden, After Reset is for the soul. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">(continuation of the interview, where you will find out whether Mark Morgan was about father games, whether AR is a competitor for Wasteland 2, and much more ... and be careful, there is really a lot of text, let's say, I got carried away)</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <i><b>Weilard:</b> What motivated you to start developing AR?</i>  <i>After all, Black Cloud Studio ‚Äúvoiced‚Äù quite recently, and before that, as I understand it, you were not engaged in game projects.</i> <br>  <b>Richard: For</b> three years, I have been doing a shard on the basis of the D20 system and on the Avrora engine for Fallout D20 Online (details are on our website: <a href="http://www.afterreset.com/forum/showthread.php%3Ft%3D1">www.afterreset.com/forum/showthread.php?t=1</a> ) As time went by ... bitterly watched that Bethesda worked with Fallout and with those who tried to reanimate it, and decided not to risk it, but to build its amusement park with blackjack and ... <br>  <i><b>Weilard:</b> ... the official companions.</i> <br>  <b>Richard:</b> ... <br><br>  <i><b>Weilard:</b> Which games or artworks inspire you to work on AR?</i>  <i>What is more, and what is less, which is the root, or the main salt?</i> <br>  <b>Richard:</b> Fallout 1/2 / VB, Baldur's Gate, Planescape: Torment, Walking Dead: the Game.  From the side of literature, this is Robert Sheckley and Roger Zelazny.  In addition, I would like to thank Vlad Cope for his selection in the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BB%25D1%258F_%25D1%2581%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8_%2528%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0%25D1%2587%25D0%25B0%2529">Model for Assembly</a> . <br><br>  <i><b>Weilard:</b> We had the opportunity to work together on a series of illustrations for AR, and I noticed that you are greatly inspired by a variety of modern brands, including Fallout.</i>  <i>In addition, in a series of discussions about AR, players noted a certain similarity of certain elements with other brands.</i>  <i>Tell us more about this please.</i> <br>  <b>Richard:</b> Trends inspire and help to very well convey the ideas of the game on an emotional level - bypassing the mind right in the heart. <br>  <i><b>Weilard:</b> ...</i> <br><br>  <i><b>Weilard:</b> As far as I understand, you were going to collaborate with Mark Morgan again on the fields of the post-apocalyptic wave thanks to the excitement around Wasteland 2. Can you confirm or turn this information?</i> <br>  <b>Richard:</b> Not ready to comment on this question (smiles). <br><br>  <i><b>Weilard:</b> Personally, on the basis of the reviewed content, I tend to see you as the main competitor of Wasteland 2. Just a year, without attracting third-party investments, as they say, for your hard-earned money, you managed to create a picture of the game, many times superior in quality to the visual part of the Wasteland 2 project. which could not hit us with beauty, even with a million budget (or rather three million dollars).</i>  <i>You, as I understand it, have no million budget, no big-name ... who does this beauty?</i>  <i>Who helps you?</i>  <i>Who sets and maintains quality standards?</i> <br>  <b>Richard:</b> I don‚Äôt think After Reset and Wasteland 2 are competitors.  These are different games in essence. After Reset is an RPG like Fallout 1 &amp; 2, Wasteland 2 is a tactical strategy, like the Commandos series of games.  And according to the setting, if the AR is a sci-fi apocalypse, then Wasteland 2 is a retro apocalypse. <br>  My position on this is that the more good games the better.  As for the picture ... I also said that I am making a game for the soul, therefore I am attentive to everything as a child.  If I made the game as a businessman, of course, the picture would be different, and the game would be different ... Because the essence of the business is to receive.  And the essence of a hobby is to give.  Quality standards support myself.  Everything is simple here - either everything is perfect or we reject the option.  Commercial "and so it will come down, the main thing is to invest in PR" in the love of business can not be.  And my ideas are embodied by a large number of freelancers, among whom a pool of the most reliable ‚Äúcomrades‚Äù, who perfectly feel the setting, is currently determined.  I really hope they will form the backbone of the developers after Kickstarter. <br><br>  <i><b>Weilard:</b> Since we are talking about beauty, can you tell us about your team?</i>  <i>Who is in it, what specialists are involved, what specialists are you planning to connect in the future?</i> <br>  <b>Richard:</b> Wow ... there are really a lot of them.  That more or less permanent pool that is mentioned can be seen on our website in the Contacts section. <br><br>  <i><b>Weilard:</b> Who is the narrator behind the scenes After Reset in your intro?</i>  <i>A professional worked for my inexperienced taste, I would like to know who it is.</i> <br>  <b>Richard:</b> Yes, I also like his voice very much.  This is my friend Martin Lewis, his voice can be heard in many Hollywood trailers, he also works with Universal Pictures. <br><br>  <i><b>Weilard:</b> Who is the author of After Reset music that permeates the listener with life-motifs of the wasteland named after Morgan Free ... Mark Morgan?</i> <br>  Mariusz Jasionowicz.  For each track it took us a month of daily work and a bucket of "sweat and blood."  Because as mentioned earlier - ‚Äúeither everything is perfect, or we reject the option.‚Äù <br><br>  <i><b>Weilard:</b> The Black Cloud logo is knocked down by its elusive similarity to the logo of the well-known and respected Black Isle studio.</i>  <i>What caused the choice of just such a path?</i>  <i>In the logo, in the art, and even in music, everything is filled with notes of a bygone era.</i>  <i>Why are there notes.</i>  <i>In your video, fonts and even the location of these reminds of the unforgettable Fallout.</i>  <i>Not afraid of reproaches of plagiarism?</i> <br>  <b>Richard:</b> As one of the Fallout fans said to Bethesda: you can take away our copyrights from us, but you will not take away our soul.  I make such a game that I myself want to play already God knows how many years.  I miss these notes, not enough of a bygone era.  And she will not go anywhere as long as she lives in our hearts and memories. <br>  <i><b>Author's note:</b> At the mention of the fan and ‚Äúagainst Bethesda,‚Äù my hair on my nape began to stir.</i>  <i>The fact is that this phrase has been the subject of a lengthy dispute in one old and respected forum.</i>  <i>Initially, I planned to write ‚ÄúTrademark is yours, but our soul‚Äù, but the older and wiser inhabitants of the forum convinced me that no open confrontation is needed, which did not prevent me from putting this slogan on the reins <a href="http://weilard.deviantart.com/art/Gods-of-Fallout-292993430">in the elk harness</a> .</i> <br><br>  <i><b>Weilard:</b> Beauty is beauties, but as we all know, the game table is at the head of the table.</i>  <i>In an exclusive video provided specifically for Habr's readers, we see a greater degree of demonstration of work with the environmental (and I must say a damn attractive job).</i>  <i>Well, in general?</i>  <i>How soon can we play AR if the Kickstarter campaign is successful?</i>  <i>Any intermediate stages?</i>  <i>Closed beta?</i>  <i>What is ready and what is not?</i> <br>  <b>Richard:</b> I can promise alpha for bakers, select journalists and robots in 2014. <br><br>  <i><b>Weilard:</b> What distinguishes After Reset in terms of gameplay among other RPGs?</i>  <i>What should we expect from the game?</i>  <i>In our time, too many things are subject to casualization, too many game mechanics are simplified.</i>  <i>In your debut video you say - ‚Äúonly hardcore!‚Äù.</i>  <i>I would like to know what exactly will be hardcore.</i>  <i>What is your understanding of hardcore?</i> <br>  <b>Richard:</b> I want to apply my experience of DM and the developer on the game servers Neverwinter Nights.  There has always been this dilemma.  Some players insisted that everything is very difficult, there are a lot of ingredients, it is very inconvenient to carry food, it is difficult to get money, monsters are too strong and so on. <br>  Others, on the contrary, said - you give the introduction of the system of fatigue, food, water, meeting the needs, we want a more complex AI, we want to complicate the variability of battles, we want to zerfit something.  I think for 5 years of observation I have chosen for myself such a balance of hardcore that it does not turn into insanity. <br><br>  <i><b>Weilard:</b> Tell us about Quanton Sync.</i>  <i>As I understand it is an online add-on that directly affects the game play of the game, if the player is connected to the network?</i>  <i>I correctly understood the essence of this service?</i>  <i>Some service that increases the degree of immersion in the world of the game?</i> <br>  <b>Richard:</b> Yes.  First, it allows all your actions after passing the game to influence the setting of the whole world After Reset, and according to the results of the game session (approximately one year after the release), to form detailed consequences - the global ending of the game.  Something similar, in a simplified version, is present in The Walking Dead: the Game, when, after passing each series, I show you how many percent of players made certain choices during the passage.  And of course through it is convenient to weave in new chips (such as random meetings, additional locations, etc.) and implement co-op. <br><br>  <i><b>Weilard:</b> What makes Unity3D a choice?</i>  <i>As far as we can see the picture on it, you give out an impressive, but nevertheless, which engines did you pay attention to before choosing Unity, and why was it chosen?</i> <br>  <b>Richard:</b> I have 5 years of experience working with Avrora (the Bioware internal engine that was used for Neverwinter Nights and Knights of the Old Republic), so I was looking for something closest to it.  In addition, Unity3D is very affordable for developers at a price and perfectly customized. <br><br>  <i><b>Weilard:</b> Do you plan in the manner of Bren Fargo to use the help of the community, engaging not only in carfounding but also in crowdsourcing as well?</i>  <i>How strong is the impact of the community on the game?</i> <br>  <b>Richard:</b> I am interested in the views of all players, as well as the choices they will make during its passage.  But my position is that any project should have its own leader, whose task is to think about all the opinions of the players, but at the same time make their decisions and take responsibility for them.  In other words, I want to make the game an interesting book, and not a social group page for discussion. <br><br>  <i><b>Weilard:</b> I am not very clever ... although I lie, really.</i>  <i>What happens to After Reset if the Kickstarter company is not successful?</i>  <i>As we know, this probability exists.</i>  <i>Tom Hall and Brenda Brethwaite, who came to KS with the Shaker project, probably didn‚Äôt expect the fundraising campaign to fail, and it‚Äôs difficult to call them newbies.</i>  <i>What will happen to you in this case, what will happen to the project?</i> <br>  <b>Richard:</b> I do not count on Kickstarter at all.  Nor counted on Steam Greenlight.  One evening I posted my project there, at random.  And it came as a complete surprise to me at what speed they began to vote for him.         .        ,     5 . <br>    -   ‚Äì - ,  ,      . <br>      ,        KS.    ‚Äì     ,     ,  -  . <br> ,    -: ¬´  ,   ‚Äì   ,    ,     ‚Äì ,   ,  ¬ª  ¬´  ,   ,    KS,        ¬ª.  ‚Ä¶ , ,     . <br>    ,        ,        After Reset.   .

After all, if I succeed, then it will turn out for any of us!</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a64/4d7/1ce/a644d71ce2a5b390fb99291bc96533f4.jpg"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Let's try to summarize our interviews and emotions with a small set of facts. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They are few, which is not surprising, because this story is just beginning.</font></font> But they are. <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Greenlight. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It took less than a week to get to the Greenlight after Reset project. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If I'm not mistaken for five days. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">That indicates interest from the potential audience. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Even if the player is not ready to invest in the development of the game - he absolutely wants to buy it.</font></font> And this is good news. <br><br>  Style.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At this stage, even at the stage of primary visualization, it is clear that the developer approaches the development of the game more than thoroughly. This is evidenced by the integrity of the image. Unlike Wasteland 2, which resembles a more popular hodgepodge, After Reset boasts a unity of style. What will happen next - is still unknown. But if you define the visual style as an intention, the intention is more than serious. Based on this, I tend to see in AR a serious competitor with the right to life, rather than a team of lovers.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Audio accompaniment. Creating a ‚Äúgood tracing paper‚Äù in a good sense of the word is not easy. The AR music now reminds Mark Morgan more than Mark Morgan himself in the project already mentioned above. I am inclined to consider such an approach not as parody or borrowing, but as strict adherence to traditions. Even in the event that every second track will sound, as today's tracks to AR sound, I will only be glad as a true Fallout fan. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Demo version. Feel himself.</font></font> Works.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For the alpha environment is more than enough. Special effects, audio accompaniment (musical and environmental sound), environment models, saturation models, character, animations, etc. are involved. Of course, there are small bugs. Of course, there is no optimization. But let's be honest, let's put our hands on our hearts and compare two screenshots. The first is the Wasteland 2 game, which has been in development for almost two years, still having the status of alpha, has not yet presented a single complete screenshot that would show us a vertical slice of the game, the second image of After Reset from ambitious newcomers that have fallen as snow on the head.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Despite the fact that the author of After Reset in every way refrains from comparisons and the title of "competitor", let me disagree. In both cases, this is an isometric view, in both cases, life after a disaster, in both cases, it is using the Unity3D engine. For me, these pictures well reflect the effectiveness of two different teams. The slogans ‚Äúgraphics are not the main thing‚Äù - I do not accept, and do not comment. Graphics, of course - not the most important link in the game. But if you do something qualitatively, you can make it qualitative as even being a follower of minimalism.</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/efb/e75/9ff/efbe759ffaddc9873a20ce590cd2d7b7.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a58/3bc/b63/a583bcb631ca43eafe0a618edc48371c.jpg"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As I mentioned the facts so far not much. Much more assumptions. However, looking at the information provided, I do not put before myself the question - to help or not. I am impressed by the stubbornness of this person, I like this approach - ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt matter how, but I will still make my game.‚Äù Adhering to exactly the same outlook on life, with the exception of success in the furniture business, I want to wish Richard good luck in his other endeavors. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After all, in the near future, I myself will have to go all the way from and to, except for the fact that I would hardly write about this publication or interview myself. I hope as Richard, at random.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I hope this publication was interesting to you. Thank you for your attention and see you soon. And they, I must say, will not delay to happen. This month is rich in discoveries. The main thing is to have enough time for this. The details of another interview with another developer, this time from Johannesburg, are currently being completed. True, most likely, the dialogue will not work. That, in general, will not affect the series of publications devoted to good projects.</font></font><br><br>  Thanks for attention.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And thanks for your time. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6d8/50b/56f/6d850b56fb2478348471c38dd56dc89b.jpg"><br><br> <i><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Note 1:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> In accordance with the request to reduce traffic, all images in the article (with the exception of shovels) are saved in JPG format. </font></font></i> <br> <i><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Note 2:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Interviews and images are under the spoilers. I know that many people are tired of ‚Äúturning the wheels‚Äù, and I think that it‚Äôs easiest to decide for yourself what you want and what you don‚Äôt, and whether you want it at all. </font></font></i> <br> <i><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Note 3:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> This text is not a product advertisement, or an auxiliary PR action by the developer. The publication is made on the rights of "rust lover" after reviewing the project. I do not in any way deny any involvement in AR. Yes, the following images are really my pen.</font></font></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/405/5c2/52b/4055c252be121cc471a6c735cd0660a0.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/429/7a2/d59/4297a2d596ff9320a632d1afd87bef3a.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2e9/3de/72f/2e93de72f84086cf0fddbc0e981fc613.jpg"><br><br> <i>       .        ‚Äî   .           .   ,      .

The answers, from those that remained, will be selective and they will not touch on those - ‚Äúwell, why did I like this game?‚Äù. It seemed to me that in the text I gave sufficient explanations to that. The fact is that the Johannesburg developer, mentioned a little earlier in the article, also gave another go-to-game for the short game about the project. That is, literally within a few days there will be a new, probably the same emotional material.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Anyone who is embarrassed by the style of publication, I would recommend the manner of submission to refrain from reading the subsequent material. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To all those who wrote me messages in my personal mail, those who, holding back curses, helped me correct my numerous mistakes, and those who just came to discuss - many thanks. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This information and the thread itself will greatly help the game developer, having formed a certain vision and sensation from his project from the audience of Habr.</font></font><br><br>  Thank you all for your attention.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Thank you for taking the time to read this material. </font></font></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/201736/">https://habr.com/ru/post/201736/</a></p>
