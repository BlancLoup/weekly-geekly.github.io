  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Here is who stimulates school pornography</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The national project of connecting Russian schools to the Internet is under threat of failure <br>  June 01, 2007 12:37 MOSCOW, June 1 (Ann).  The head of Synterra, Vitaly Sluzhen, at a recent press conference, was forced to admit his company's inability to fulfill its commitments to connect schools to the Internet as part of the national Education project. <br>  According to the head of Synterra, in July his company may stop connecting schools to the Internet due to the lack of communication channels in Karelia, Murmansk and Arkhangelsk regions. <br>  Experts warned of such a development of events as early as September 2006, when Synterra‚Äôs subsidiary, RTKomm, won a dubious tender to hold all Russian schools on the Internet without having a kilometer of its own telecommunications network. <br>  Until now, Synterru has rescued an administrative resource.  On orders from the Svyazinvest holding, subsidiary interregional telecommunications companies (RTOs) on non-market conditions sold the companies of the former Deputy Minister of Communications to part of their channels and carry out work on the physical connection of schools to the network. <br>  Hard pressure to connect schools at a price much lower than the cost was applied to all telecom operators, which Synterra looked after as subcontractors (there is not a single announcement of open competition among subcontractors on the RTComm website). <br>  Quite a bit, unexpectedly, large traffic from schools, which the company refers to as the reason for the lack of communication channels, turned out to be very useful. <br>  According to Rossvyaznadzor, where the information leak came from, in 98% of the connected schools, 5 out of the 5 most popular resources are sites of pornographic content.  The fact that the provider does not ensure the fulfillment of the conditions of the competition and does not restrict "access to resources unrelated to the educational process," the Presidential Control Department noted in December.  The ‚Äústrange‚Äù delay in the implementation of access restriction systems (which would have caused a sharp drop in traffic) will allow Synterra to explain the project‚Äôs failure, and at the same time blackmail accusations that other operators are unpatriotic, many of which refuse to sell or lease Synterra non-market prices. <br>  Among other dangers that await the national project performed by Vitaly Slizen, experts point out the extremely high number of land infrastructure replacements with VSAT satellite two-way access systems.  In Dagestan alone, as reported by Synterra, it is planned to install 500 systems and another 389 - in Chechnya. The cost of one system with installation is at least about $ 5,000. <br>  ‚ÄúIn a year, there will be no such systems in any school,‚Äù say people familiar with Caucasian realities. <br>  Vitaly Slizen's statement about the possible disruption of the national project, which runs counter to the major rhetoric of the authorities, can be assessed as the start of a PR campaign to secure further funding for the project for 2008-2009, which will be discussed this fall.  Obviously, Synterra is confident of receiving new budgetary injections, because the bulk purchase of VSAT systems is far beyond the current budget, but it allows the company to build a powerful federal telecommunications network, which Slyzen himself acknowledged will be actively used for commercial purposes. </div>
