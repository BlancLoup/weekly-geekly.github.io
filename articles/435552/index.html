According to the comments of colleagues who commented on the first article <a href="https://habr.com/post/423823/">‚ÄúImport Substitution, Voice Crying in the Desert‚Äù</a> and the second article <a href="https://habr.com/post/426073/">‚ÄúImport Substitution, Tales Continue (Continued)‚Äù</a> decided to share practical attempts and consider this topic a little bit from a different angle. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  1. The first of unpleasant surprises, finally solved the dilemma - open source software (free) or domestic? <br><br>  In the expected result - <b>Domestic and only paid!</b> <b>
      <br>

        </script>
      <br>
    </b>  To the question why this is so, I will clarify: <br><br>  in the <b>‚Äútarget indicators‚Äù</b> and accordingly in the requested reports (on top) there is a request <i>not for the number of domestic licenses</i> , but for the <b>amount spent on purchasing software from the register of the Ministry of Communications and Mass Communications</b> . <br><br>  As if nothing bad is in it, but when considering import substitution (such as a good idea) as a target program, instead of a proclaimed goal (reducing sanction risk and raising the domestic IT industry), we got a goal indicator of a completely different direction ‚Äî the percentage of the amount of finance spent on "From the registry, to the total cost of software. <br><br>  Theoretically, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãimport substitution is a good but actual goal and, accordingly, the very way of realization is quite different. <br><br>  For the sake of simplicity of the concept and acceptance of this fact, it is easier to present it <b>as a tax on non-patriotism</b> : <br><br><ul><li>  for government agencies, with 80% of domestic software, the tax will be 500%; </li><li>  for municipal institutions with 50% of domestic software - the tax will be 100%. </li></ul><br>  Want to 100 p.  buy bourgeois software, then immediately buy for 500 or 100 p.  accordingly, Russian, even if you have nowhere to put it and you do not need it. <br><br>  2. The second surprise awaits the state-owned company - and a very unpleasant one. <br><br>  They will be obliged in the near future to switch to domestic software as well as state software.  and mun.  institutions and even faster.  But the one who invented this Disgusting, forgot that companies differ from institutions in that they are focused on making a profit, and software in this case is just a tool for obtaining it. <br><br>  The better the tool works, the greater the profit (by analogy, the more productive the machines are, the greater the profit).  It seems that Karl Marx taught this, and forcibly introducing state-owned companies at a loss (and bankrupt) for the sake of an idea turned inside out is complete chaos.  According to this path you can return to the plow and hoe (but to the native-native). <br><br>  3. The third surprise - for those glad that their software is in the registry: <br><br>  In the near future, they want to remove from the registry the software that is tied to the import engines of SQL, Oracle and so on.  And not every Information System (without stopping the process) and not every budget will master the radical change of corporate software (due to the change of engines). <br>  The federal budget has already invented trillions of rubles for digitalization and import substitution, and I think they will also be eagerly mastered, as well as earlier for the ‚ÄúCrimean bridge‚Äù and the Eastern Cosmodrome. <br><br>  Just before, these MEGA projects were not directly related to each region and municipality. <br>  Outside the Moscow Ring Road there is simply no additional money for a ‚Äú100% tax on non-patriotism‚Äù. <br><br>  4. ‚ÄúDigitalization with elements of import substitution‚Äù - this is still a surprise, the digital inequality was decided to eliminate all other inequalities of the CERD. <br><br>  In settlements, without gas, water supply, heating, and with toilets on the street, and electricity in places, there will be an optical Internet connection, probably in order to put Nano-counters from Skolkovo on wells and closets. <br><br>  5. Testing the ‚Äúsoftware of the past‚Äù for two months of trial and error, added only a bucket ... to a large barrel (mentioned above). <br><br>  5.1.  thin clients with domestic software DepoOS - do not support RemoteFX, and their video capacity is not enough for normal operation (even without graphical tasks); <br><br>  5.2.  <a href="">Ala-free versions (not recent) ROSA</a> - a very old clone of 2012 centos, does not allow to the ROSA repository.  From this we can assume that even if we buy a new version of ROSA, we get not a permanent license, <b>but we rent</b> , there is no such restriction even from free Centos. <br><br>  5.3 In vain they scolded the white list of iron for bourgeois programs like HCL, as it turned out <a href="">ROSA (a la Centos 6.7)</a> every day dropped the Supermicro server (and earlier HP) (even when idle, because nothing could be delivered without repositories) and the Centos 6.9 mini build has been working on the same hardware with EMC ScaleIO on board in production for more than a month (Vmware previously worked).  It seems that there is one basis there and there, but the quality of implementation is different, but Russian. <br><br>  5.4.  The issue of the list of compatibility of home-grown operating systems with system and application software.  We have to work very hard to find under which branch of RHEL, CENTOS, OEL, DEBIAN and other varieties to install the distribution kit and drivers.  Information is either very far hidden or missing. <br><br>  5.x The list can be continued indefinitely - just even on the basis of these not very successful attempts, <b>only one question is slandered in my head:</b> why change well working for <u>"... lectures" (in the most perverse sense of the word)</u> and also pay a lot of money for it (which is also NO). <br><br>  Breaking one of the main tenets of the admins ‚ÄúDo not do better - if it works well!‚Äù (‚ÄúDon‚Äôt touch, if it works!‚Äù) <br><br>  It was not for nothing that they invented a square with ‚Äúleaders‚Äù and ‚Äúvisionaries‚Äù, why change ‚Äúleaders‚Äù of the type ‚ÄúVMware‚Äù, ‚ÄúOracle‚Äù, ‚ÄúVeeam‚Äù, ‚ÄúEmc‚Äù, for those who are not even in the Ausiders. <br><br>  Thanks to our clever laws, we have already imposed sanctions on ourselves, having deprived ourselves of technical support and maintenance in 2018, although none of the bourgeois manufacturers refused to refuse us and did not impose sanctions. <br><br>  In order not to end on a particularly sad note, I‚Äôll inform you that I have found a spoonful of useful things that can give us a chance to survive the troubled times of dividing funds for import substitution. <br><br>  a) Terminal solutions (thin clients or a hybrid version of computers (not i3-i7) with a remote desktop client) allow using free server capacities to smoothly and gradually try domestic software and follow IM-path (to transfer to production it is enough to switch to another connection (quickly and painlessly), and also convenient for the case of checking the percentage of patriotism.) <br><br>  b) It is advisable to assemble a rack for debugging ‚ÄúDomestic Software‚Äù on <a href="https://galtsystems.com/">old servers</a> , and thereby kill two birds with one stone and solve the problem of a spare data center for the <i>‚ÄúMobilization Case‚Äù</i> and in case of checking the percentage of domestic software.  As everything will be debugged, you can transfer a turnkey solution to the main server kit. <br><blockquote>  - Happy you Hunger Games. <br>  - And may good luck always be with you. </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/435552/">https://habr.com/ru/post/435552/</a></p>
