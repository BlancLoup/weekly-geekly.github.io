Historical experience</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The theme of the combination of labor enthusiasm and the success of the company as a whole is not uncommon on Megamind.  But, unfortunately, the practice of our country shows that, for the most part, examples of a successful combination of employees' interests and the interests of companies are the lot of relatively small companies.  The reasons for this are many and the reasons are sad ... <br><br>  But in the history of the country there was a period when one of the foundations of the economy was the enthusiasm of employees!  Let's see how it was and draw conclusions? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So.  Just under a hundred years ago.  After a decade of war, the economy is in ruins.  Trade embargo.  A huge number of illegal armed formations of the most variegated composition - from those with fundamental differences with the victorious authorities, to criminals.  Deputy Chairman of the GPU Unshlicht <a href="http://istmat.info/node/24546">reports</a> : <br><br><blockquote>  The political and economic situation of the Republic in April-May is characterized by the following main points: <br>  1) deterioration of the economic condition of the Republic; <br>  2) anxious mood under the impression of a serious illness comrade.  Lenin, and then the English ultimatum and the possibility of a close war;  finally, <br>  3) characteristic for the spring period development of banditry.

      The deterioration of the economic condition.  The most important issue of the moment is a sharp deterioration in the state of our industry, expressed in the winding up of enterprises in many of its branches as a result of the lack of marketing and raw materials and the current financial crisis.  The crisis has particularly affected the state of enterprises that feed in imported raw materials (textile) and in small-scale enterprises that depend directly on the market. <br><br>  The collapse of industry has worsened the financial situation of workers, causing, on the one hand, a suspension of wage growth, and on the other, increasing unemployment. <br><br>  Everywhere, political banditry is fed from abroad by both recruits and organizers.  In Ukraine, banditry is predominantly criminal in nature, however, here too, the leadership of counter-revolutionary organizations from abroad is felt. <br>  The mismanagement of the administration.  Often enterprises experience a financial crisis due to the mismanagement of the administration. <br><br>  Mismanagement is most often caused by the inexperience of enterprise managers. <br><br>  The closure of enterprises is often also caused by sabotage of the administration and a certain desire of its to bring the company into a state of loss in order to lease it.  In a number of provinces, embezzlement and embezzlement of factory property have been recorded. <br><br>  The improvement in the material situation of the workers, outlined by May, is suspended at the end of May, and even in some places a certain deterioration is planned.  The reason is the inadequacy of rates, marked by all industrial gubernias, and the debts of enterprises to workers. <br><br>  Increased material insecurity of workers also causes an increase in the number of strikes. <br></blockquote><br>  It would seem how far away from us, but just to rephrase a little: <br><br>  The economic situation of the Russian Federation is characterized by the following main points: <br>  1) the deterioration of the macroeconomic development of the main sectors of the economy; <br>  2) speculation based on rumors of Putin‚Äôs illness <br>  3) the introduction of new anti-Russian sanctions and constant rumors about the possibility of war; <br>  3) the constant growth of IT threats. <br><br>  The deterioration of the economic condition.  The most important issue of the moment is a sharp deterioration in the state of our industry, expressed in the winding up of enterprises in many of its branches as a result of the financial crisis.  The crisis has particularly affected the state of enterprises that depend on the supply of components from abroad, as well as small and medium-sized businesses, depending on the level of effective public demand. <br>  ... <br><br>  But let's not talk about sad things.  On the other hand, the twenties are still the continuing idealism of those who believe in a bright future ‚Äî even omnipotence of bureaucracy and total planning systems is still far away. <br><blockquote>  - In America, better organization of work, better equipment and better workers. <br>  If we have peace, we will be like in America. <br>  - How long will it take to achieve American standards? <br>  - Maybe twenty years, maybe ten ... How can I know ... I think the French and Poles will not allow us to. <br>  - How long will it take to achieve American standards at this plant? <br>  "Three or four years" - he said more optimistically <br><br>  The plant worked at half the capacity compared with the pre-war time and produced only half of the pre-war production volumes. <br></blockquote><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/214/0d4/115/2140d4115c01464b8f3f13266fe3df4e.jpg"><br><br>  But let's move on to the topic of the article.  What was the organization of labor? <br><br><blockquote>  The plant director is given the solution of technical issues, problems of raw materials, finance, equipment, sales markets, organization of technological processes. <br><br>  The human part of the work, the internal life of the plant, is managed by the Working Committee, employees who are on salary, but chosen by the workers. <br><br>  They also solve various kinds of conflicts, sometimes separately, sometimes at meetings with the management of the plant. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWhat kind of conflicts?  Salary?  Work time? ‚ÄùI asked. <br><br>  ‚ÄúNo‚Äù - answered me. <br><br>  ‚ÄúDuration of work is determined by law, wages - by collective agreement. <br><br>  But imagine that there is an agreement under which management is obliged to provide clothing for hot shops and dirty work, to provide additional power for heavy work. <br><br>  Some workers believe that they should get it, and management believes that these workers do not fall under the conditions specified in the agreement. <br><br>  There are disputes between workers. <br><br>  All this is solved by us without recourse to the leadership. " <br><br>  I told them that I myself should have understood that the effective work of the committee saves the leadership from solving many problems.  He apparently was surprised that I was talking about such obvious things. <br><br>  ‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù he said. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe are here to help the industry work well‚Äù <br><br>  ‚Äú <strong>Well, and who is ultimately responsible for the efficiency of the enterprise</strong> ?  When you say to me that the productivity per person is even higher than it was before the war, whose merit is it? ‚ÄùI asked. <br><br>  " <strong>Total merit</strong> ," he replied. <br><br>  ‚Äú <strong>It is in our common interest to make the plant work better.</strong>  <strong>Only in this way can we achieve higher wages and improve the lives around us</strong> .  The director is responsible for improving the technical conditions, and we care about people. ‚Äù <br></blockquote><br>  On the part of the staff, management was carried out by working committees: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/a22/a97/933/a22a97933cd41b4ccdb8ca97aec81e50.jpg"><br><br><blockquote>  They are chosen by the workers of the plant, these representatives are similar to our trade union leaders, however, here every concern concludes an agreement with the trade union, and the representatives of the trade union have their own office right at the factory, solving the problems that arise. <br></blockquote><br>  Perhaps we can say that in that period - a period of severe economic crisis - without relying on the involvement of the broad masses of the population in the control system, the country's withdrawal from the economic crisis was not possible.  Unfortunately, this experiment was curtailed and emasculated.  The same trade unions exist today - but has anyone seen their actual participation in economic management? <br><br>  What should this experience teach us?  It is not enough to create a company or team that combines the interests of its members and the interests of the company.  It is necessary to create a self-sustaining system so that in a few years the company does not become another hierarchical structure - while maintaining enthusiastic press descriptions and nostalgic memories of the few remaining old men in the smoking room. <br><br>  All quotes are taken <a href="http://ljwanderer.livejournal.com/315020.html">here</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294874/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294874/</a></p>
