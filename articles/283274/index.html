Simply put, I needed a comfortable player.  There was a desire to listen to music - using a smartphone in a couple of clicks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/067/3c7/33c/0673c733cf58471fed8035466d3675e8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Analysis </h2><br>  At that point in time - if you needed to find something from any composition, you had to:

    <ol><li>  Choose a search service </li><li>  Execute query </li><li>  For each link go to the found resource </li><li>  Play content online </li></ol><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first difficulty was exactly where to get the necessary content - that is, music. <br>  Immediately I remembered the resource zaycev.net. <br><br>  The source code of resource pages in the browser showed that there are no direct links to the files - it is strange, because quite recently it allowed not only to play but also to save music.  After registration and authorization in the system - the source code of the page displayed a list of tracks when clicking on each link - the necessary direct links were displayed.  So it was arranged earlier ... <br><br>  Consequently, it all came down to the first thing - to give the opportunity to log in with your account, secondly to give the opportunity to search, filter the list of the found result, then having a direct link for each link of the track you could listen to the desired result. <br><br><h2>  Development </h2><br>  It happened quite quickly and easily - after three days the first prototype was ready which allowed: to pass the user's authorization, to search and play music.  It was a logical desire to share the application with other people. <br><br><h2>  Copyright </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1ca/157/b41/1ca157b41ecd185faef9200e7e185414.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Having thought about the copyright to the music of many of the performers who created it (with respect), looked at the history of the resource zaycev.net - it turned out that in 2008 they were already suing media companies.  The resource was first covered up, but then it ‚Äúresurrected‚Äù again - deciding very difficult legal issues. <br><br>  The resource itself zaycev.net gave a description of <a href="http://zaycev.net/law.shtml">how this system works</a> .  In short, this is a file-exchange resource where the user has the right to upload their tracks - the administration is not responsible for this - only the user if there are any complaints from media companies - then media companies have the right to write about illegal content on the resource and use ban on its distribution. <br><br><h2>  Users support </h2><br>  A month after the launch, there were already about 5,000 thousand downloads of the application - and this is without any third-party advertising! <br><br>  There was hard work supporting the application - motivated by a large number of user reviews.  Someone necessarily something did not work.  Android, as we know, is quite a fragmentary system - that is, there are many different modifications and versions - and each device has its own differences.  But I had to make mistakes - not without it.  The main mistake is when you hurry to release an update, but you don‚Äôt really have time to thoroughly test everything - it was like this at the beginning. <br><br>  Many ideas arose: for example, the ability to view the biography of performers - made, laid out on the same day.  Or transition between different categories - TOP 100, NEWS and display of the text of songs.  Configuration settings, incidentally, the study of the functioning of the system android - the release of new versions of Android (respectively, the new fragmentation of the system and new unforeseen errors). <br><br>  It was decided to improve the design - to create a unique icon, change the start page.  He offered a designer to work.  The idea was formed on the fly - on the icon depict a crazy hare-music lover in headphones.  Along the way, managed to change the standard interface buttons and make two color options. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9fd/c47/a83/9fdc47a83171a44e3edd64ee3e01be66.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Resource owner feedback </h2><br>  Three months later, an employee of the resource zaycev.net informed that they wanted to purchase the application. <br><br><h3>  Interface has changed </h3><br>  In parallel, I was approached by a user of the program (an interface design specialist) - he proposed to improve / optimize the interface and indeed his perception was much more experienced. <br><br>  The new owner provided full access to the resource and told how to use its updated server API - provided new icons and later its visual presentation of the interface. <br><br>  After all this, a new round of application distribution was launched and there were about ~ 8,000 installations per day. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/16f/f3e/07d/16ff3e07d73676cd335b13091717d54b.png" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Continuation </h3><br>  As a result, the application was sold to the resource.  Several times it was removed from the Google Play Market and resurrected by a legal miracle. <br><br>  When developing a new application, you may encounter legal issues and claims of media groups on the use of music through the program - which is logical.  Now I'm interested in finding a solution to this issue - I wonder how exactly large companies cooperate with media groups?  And is it possible to solve the legal use of media content by an ordinary developer?  Where to get a resource or API for this content? <br><br>  There is an awareness that single-piece tracks interest a smaller audience.  I consider it right when a subscription is made - for some time, in order to make full use of the product.  Or payment for the application itself - and then already up the stairs.  Just as this bundle is a user-application-media group, so well formed, so that everyone is happy?  So far the challenge.  Maybe someone more experienced will tell? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/be1/8ef/118/be18ef118116069c70bb8c28915b8b82.png" alt="image"><br><br>  These are the indicators of the use of the zaycev.net application that were able to be recorded on the Google Play Market a year ago, ~ 10 million users, about 230 thousand reviews.  The average rating of 4.5 has not changed since the first versions - which indicates a certain quality of the developed application. <br><br>  Thanks for attention! <br><br>  Successful ideas! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/283274/">https://habr.com/ru/post/283274/</a></p>
