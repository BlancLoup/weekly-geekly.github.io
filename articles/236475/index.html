Using this platform allows you to deploy a full-scale marketing company that uses most of the usual advertising and analysis tools.  The use of the site is not worth a penny. <br><br>  In addition to "Business", there are several other sites and tools of Google, whose task is to help entrepreneurs develop and promote their project.  Unfortunately, not all of them are focused on the Russian sector, but this does not make them completely inaccessible for the domestic entrepreneur. <br><br>  Google Video My Business <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/LCzri4tXuF0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgNL4rM42VpFVXU0dAYRsF8BJE-UQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
