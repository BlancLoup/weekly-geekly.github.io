  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sound through the bones. SoundAround Headset Overview</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Most recently, I wrote about a device that can act as <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dadget/blog/272222/">external speakers</a> for a tablet or smartphone.  Then it was about listening to music by the company.  I decided to see what is new in the field of individual listening. <br><br>  I first met unusual sound transmission technology at the age of 7.  Then I first saw an army walkie-talkie and learned what a <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259B%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D1%2584%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD">laryngo phone is</a> .  It seemed something incredible: you can speak in a whisper and you will be perfectly audible. <br>  A couple of decades passed and I felt deja vu, I again got acquainted with the new technology of sound transmission: you can listen to music individually and with open ears.  Sound vibrations are transmitted through the bones, and the audibility is the same as when using conventional headphones.  I decided to study in detail the possibilities of these headphones and wore them for a week, taking them off only for the night.  I will describe my observations below. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/188/b75/6d7/188b756d75ab48da99d04890cb9dcba7.jpg">

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Headphones based on bone conduction in the form of a commercial product have recently entered the market.  But in the military industry, they are used a little longer, and the laryngophones mentioned by me have gained popularity there.  Although, if you pay attention to the Russian military equipment "Warrior", you can see that now uses a regular earpiece.  I think this is done so that in the rumble of the battle, at least with one ear, you can hear the commands transmitted by the radio. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/817/e93/97a/817e9397a50e4f6ba2b9e4a767871eb1.jpg"><br><br>  Well, we live in a peaceful environment, so we have slightly different requirements for sound transmission.  According to my observations, I would divide all people who use headphones in everyday life (street, work, gym) into two categories: <br>  1. I want to withdraw into myself so that no one distracts <br>  2. I need rhythm, music and talks on the phone with free hands <br><br>  And if the first category of people chooses gags or full closed headphones, then the second tends to minimalism so that you can remove them in the shortest possible time to hear what is happening around.  The <a href="https://dadget.ru/katalog/aktivnyj-otdyh/aftershokz">SoundAround</a> headset (or <a href="https://dadget.ru/katalog/aktivnyj-otdyh/aftershokz">Aftershokz Bluez 2</a> ) is intended for the second category of users. <br><br>  <b>Packing and packaging</b> <br>  Headphones come in a beautiful big box that would fit several pairs.  That is, the manufacturer did not stint on the packaging.  But they look presentable, so the headset can serve as a spectacular gift. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/03a/e21/2ce/03ae212ce4bb448eac108a21eb682ced.jpg"><br><br>  Unfolding the box, it is difficult to miss the first instructions for the use of headphones.  The picture clearly demonstrates that no need to close the ears. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/535/f56/85b/535f5685b8804bfb8d1565cbe590f5ad.jpg"><br><br>  The package includes the headset itself, a snap-on elastic band to reduce the bezel, a fabric case, a USB-microUSB cable for charging the device, original instructions and translation of instructions from the Dadzhet company.  In principle, more is needed. <br><br>  <b>First look</b> <br>  The headset comes in three different colors: black, neon green and red.  The inner part, which is in contact with the head, is painted in neon color, and the coating itself is pleasant to the touch - soft touch. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/323/164/1b6/3231641b6c1c40aca86a8b2783341cbe.jpg"><br><br>  If you look at the headset from the bottom, you can see the controls and the microUSB connector, which is covered with a rubber stopper, to charge the internal battery. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1c6/eb0/0e8/1c6eb00e88684190aeac1807d0b5a886.jpg"><br><br>  And although this is not a completely waterproof solution, it will help protect the connector from rain drops.  Nearby are the volume buttons and the on / off button of the device.  There is also an LED indicator for charging and operation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f10/983/52a/f1098352a11b4ab5b14cc54891ea736c.jpg"><br><br>  The inner surface of the points adjacent to the temporal region, rubberized and has pronounced projections.  The volume up button has a bulge for recognizing the meaning of the button with tactile sensations like Braille.  There is no bulge on the volume down button of this ‚Äúvolume switch‚Äù. At first, it is somewhat unusual to feel open ears, but after a few hours of use it passes. <br><br>  <b>First start</b> <br>  To first turn on, you need to press the power button and hold for about 10 seconds.  Then besides the greeting you will hear the pleasant female voice ‚ÄúPairing‚Äù.  This means that the device is searchable.  At this moment, we start the search for Bluetooth devices from a smartphone, phone or computer and select AfterShokz BLUEZ 2. The connection takes place without entering the pin code, other devices cannot be connected after connection.  The next time you turn on the headset will automatically connect to the latest device. <br>  The headset rests on the back of its head with its bow, but if this is not enough, then you can use the rubber strap included in the package, which forms a smaller handle.  Thus, you can customize the device for any user. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/86e/6e1/8a6/86e6e18a62b140bba4ff7b6402b6285e.jpg"><br><br>  <b>We use!</b> <br>  Connected, conveniently located, included on the smartphone music.  Incredibly, the sound is almost the same as when using ordinary headphones.  Yes, this headset has small holes and the sound is partially perceived by the eardrums, but it is enough to plug the ears from external noise, as it becomes clear that the sound is indeed transmitted differently.  With the ears closed, by the way, the sound acquires a chic bass. <br>  No wonder I always say "headset", because this gadget is equipped with microphones.  They are located on the right "ear", and on the left is a multi-function button.  She is responsible for answering calls, pausing for playing music, and double clicking switches the melody to the next one in the list.  The sensitivity of the microphone is sufficient to talk in the normal mode, but it is worth understanding that the microphone located at the ear requires a certain volume when talking.  The voice is somewhat distorted, compared to the usual conversation on the phone.  Due to the presence of microphones, <a href="https://dadget.ru/katalog/aktivnyj-otdyh/aftershokz">wireless</a> noise suppression technology has been introduced into our <a href="https://dadget.ru/katalog/aktivnyj-otdyh/aftershokz">wireless devices</a> .  Its peculiarity lies in the fact that external noise perceived by the microphone is released in the form of sound in antiphase when transmitted to headphones.  More often this applies to closed headphones to create the highest quality sound with minimal exposure to external noise. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bd8/c0b/7ae/bd8c0b7aeff6450b955b8c1a295325f5.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Chips</b> <br>  The functionality of the universal button was mentioned above.  Now let's say that the headset is equipped with four different sound settings - an equalizer.  Switching between modes is performed by simultaneously pressing the + and - volume.  In complete silence or with ears plugged, the difference in sound will be noticeable, but not in the street or in noisy traffic. <br>  I think that another headset is that the headset periodically talks.  These her ‚ÄúPairing, Battery low, Welcome to Bluez two, Device connected‚Äù and other phrases are pleasantly surprising.  That is, you‚Äôll learn about a dead battery not by some kind of picking or blinking of a LED somewhere behind your ear, but by a pleasant female voice. <br><br>  <b>How is it in operation?</b> <br>  After three hours of operation, my ears are out of habit.  It was once and all subsequent days, I did not notice the headset, so that the ergonomics at the level.  I am glad that the single standard of connectors (microUSB) has not bypassed this device, so it‚Äôs not necessary to look for an additional charging cable.  With daily use of the gadget, I listened to music for several hours, and the rest of the time it was on standby or served for negotiations.  The latter should be discussed in more detail: headphones that allow you to enjoy music and socialize are especially useful for those who are used to live an active life and often communicate.  At the same time for a live conversation is not required to pull out the headset from the ear, because you continue to hear the surrounding space, as before.  This is passive safety: when playing sports on a bicycle, roller skates or skating, it is important to hear what is happening around.  But music helps keep the rhythm alive.  Moreover, with this use, the ears do not sweat, which inevitably occurs when using any other type of headphones. <br>  As for the charging frequency, it is worth noting the low power consumption of Bluetooth 3.0 technology.  With regular listening to music and talking on a <a href="https://dadget.ru/katalog/aktivnyj-otdyh/aftershokz">bluetoth headset</a> , I charged the device no more than once every three to four days. <br>  With this method of listening there are downsides: in the subway, this headset is useless, and with active driving at speeds above 100 km / h in a car with standard noise isolation, you have to speak loudly so that the other person can hear you.  In the subway you can make a funny feint with your ears: it is enough to use earplugs and then the sound literally surrounds, thanks to good bone conduction.  At the same time, the main advantage of these headphones is lost - you practically stop hearing all the surrounding sounds. <br><br>  <b>Oh, sport, you are life!</b> <br>  It is worth noting that the compact and ergonomic form of <a href="https://dadget.ru/katalog/aktivnyj-otdyh/aftershokz">wireless headphones</a> , as well as the ability to hear the surrounding space, and pushes the sporting feats.  Such a headset keeps well both on an uncovered head, and under a helmet or a helmet.  Do not neglect safety techniques and give up the helmet for the duration of the workout, if you want to listen to music.  Well, when you descend from a mountain on a snowboard, you can even answer the call, you just need to touch the multifunctional button with just one hand - it's quick, easy and safe. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f82/791/aff/f82791aff864404093ec2a8621f400e2.jpg"><br><br>  And if you look closely, you can see that <a href="https://dadget.ru/katalog/aktivnyj-otdyh/aftershokz">AfterShokz wireless headphones</a> do not interfere with wearing a helmet at all. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1ea/275/501/1ea275501f1242e1b22d25e156199a0c.jpg"><br><br>  Pros: <br><ul><li>  Excellent ergonomics, pleasant to the touch materials and high-quality assembly </li><li>  Using Bluetooth 3.0 protocol, which has less power consumption than previous revision </li><li>  Worthy sound quality </li><li>  High level of passive safety due to the fact that the ears remain open </li><li>  Easy operation </li><li>  Incredible feelings from listening to music and the whole surrounding space - a separate bonus </li></ul><br><br>  Minuses: <br><ul><li>  Useless in the metro and noisy places </li><li>  Distort the sound of voice </li><li>  Practically not combined with headdresses </li><li>  Shifts the eyeglasses from the usual place.  It does not matter when using sport glasses, but when using a conventional frame it can be a problem. </li></ul><br><br>  On the video headset works at maximum volume, so you can estimate how much will be audible to others.  From a distance of a meter in a quiet room will be heard. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/5teZpaNv4zg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhmDTTX4goJlGUrPr7tuprDZkMvvg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br>  For a week of using this headset, I drove more than 500 km behind the wheel, spent 4 hours in the gym, spent 40 hours in the office at the workplace, let the headset try on a dozen people, listened to a list of selected tracks several times and watched the movie in complete silence, using only headphones .  What can I say?  I love gadgets! <br>  Exactly!  The price may be high at times, but new products breaking the road to new technologies cannot be cheap.  This headset for a few moments brought me back to childhood, and then brought me to reality and allowed me to communicate, listen to music, and hear the world around me.  And it was comfortable. <br>  The same headset can be purchased at the store <a href="https://dadget.ru/katalog/aktivnyj-otdyh/aftershokz%3Futm_referrer%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_term%3Daftershokz%26utm_content%3Daftershokz%26utm_campaign%3Daftershokz_170">Dadzhet</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/392093/">https://habr.com/ru/post/392093/</a></p>
