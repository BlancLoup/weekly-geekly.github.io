Work on it</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dj/vg/ib/djvgibt_jvqmag-fkf3cknx6vum.jpeg"><br>  <i>Attention!</i>  <i>This article does not call for self-healing!</i>  <i>Not an ad.</i>  <i>People are unique, there is no uniform scheme for everyone.</i> <br><br>  The article will have a more motivational color than a scattering of medical terms.  Nevertheless, I consider it a place to be, as a real story of the transition from despair to good results. <br><br><h4>  Prehistory </h4><br>  At 22, I became the proud owner of 4 hernias of the lumbar spine.  For me it was a shock, because I love an active lifestyle and sports in general.  How they appeared difficult to say.  Simply, at some point, her back began to ache all the way up.  Relying on Russian, I continued to play my favorite football and finished playing. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Diagnosis </h4><br>  Started trips to the neurologists.  One massaged his back, stabbed his legs with a needle: "You do not have hernias."  The second sent for x-rays and asked a bunch of questions: "Young man, you have no hernia."  Reassured by these words, I continued to prick some blockades, vitamins and painkillers.  The pain did not pass, and I decided to go on an MRI.  The young lady at the reception, stretching a piece of paper with a diagnosis, smiled sweetly and said: "So young, and already 4 hernias."  I looked at the sheet with bulging eyes.  0.9 cm, 0.8 cm, 0.5 cm and 0.5 cm from the bottom up, the channel is not narrowed.

    <h4>  The search for truth </h4><br>  Trips to the doctors continued, but with an MRI in hand.  For 4 years I tried a lot and spent a lot of money.  Most claimed to end up with sports and do only therapeutic exercises.  But the love of football was doing its own, and I was not going to put up with it. <br>  Regular injections of auflutop, electrophoresis with caripain, vitamins, blockades, therapeutic exercises, a pool and much more did not give the desired effect and freedom of movement.  Doctors offered various operations.  Such as cold plasma nucleoplasty, replacement of vertebrae with titanium German ones.  Probably, such people are driven by monetary gain, because I was embarrassed by how willingly they wanted to put me under the knife, without guaranteeing a positive result.  I even ended up on the floors of the neurosurgery of one hospital, with a filled medical card and a referral for an operation, thank God I managed to get my feet in time! <br><br>  Having read books, after watching a video on the Internet, it was decided to treat the back in a complex, without surgical intervention.  By this time, I had already lost my form and gained extra pounds. <br><br>  Anyway, I went in for sports.  Not as active, of course, as before, but engaged.  After the games, the back began to hurt after 2 hours. If I tensed up hard, not limiting myself, I could not walk the next day. <br><br><h4>  Treatment </h4><br>  I'm desperate.  4 years nothing helped me.  The measures that I took were only enough for the daily routine.  And I wanted to live life to the fullest.  Skiing, playing football to the fullest. <br><br>  There is a desire, but where to direct the forces is not clear.  I decided to go to another medical center specializing in the treatment of back exercise.  I was not particularly enthusiastic, but I wanted to try their technique. <br><br>  Before the first training, the doctor examined me.  A prerequisite was made by MRI.  The examination lasted about 20 minutes. Then there was a conversation in which the doctor was 100% sure that he could help me.  He filled out a training card, which indicated the types of exercises and the increasing workload to class. <br><br>  The first cycle included 12 lessons.  Workout plan: <br><br><ul><li>  warm up (10 minutes); </li><li>  direct exercises with a personal trainer (40 minutes): <br><ul><li>  most exercises on the back of the thigh; </li><li>  bracing exercises; </li></ul></li><li>  stretching (stretching and flexibility exercises with a personal masseuse, 15 minutes); </li><li>  sauna (as much as you want). </li></ul><br>  I liked it there.  The trainers told / showed the correct technique for doing the exercises, were friendly and welcoming.  From the first days I noticed a positive trend.  It became easier to bend down, the notorious pains began to fade into the background.  When you feel the result, you begin to believe in this technique, cling to it as the last chance and begin to follow all the recommendations without question and quality. <br><br>  In one of the trainings, in the stretching hall, the massage therapist bent the stick (or rather, he bent over) and I again felt a sharp pain that continued until the next lesson.  I complained to the head physician, he reassured me and sent me to a freeze.  On the lower back, they made them freeze and were sent to work as usual.  The pain passed at the end of the lesson. <br><br>  In the same center I tried 5 sessions of shock wave therapy, because I heard a lot about it.  Feelings are good.  I felt all my nerves that had ever been pinched.  It didn‚Äôt make me worse, only better.  But I didn‚Äôt have the wow effect, like some of them. <br><br>  Along with the workouts, I continued to go to the pool once a week.  There I swam about 1.7-2 km in 1 hour, depending on my mood.  The styles alternated 100 meters in bras, 100 meters in a crawl, 100 meters in the back.  After the swims, there was also a positive dynamics in the lower back, the pain was practically not strained. <br><br>  Of course, proper nutrition.  Overweight in the treatment of the back plays a very bad role.  It is necessary to get rid of fat.  I did not adhere to rigid diets, but I returned my constant 86 kilograms from 94-eh in a couple of months. <br><br>  Vitamin complexes.  I do not know how much they help, but for reinsurance I decided to drink the most banal.  Calcium with D3 and common vitamins for the whole body. <br><br>  The most important thing is morning exercises for the back.  Below I will give the option of charging, which I was offered at the medical center. <br><br>  With fear for the result, I went to the football field.  Gave out on the full.  And ... ... voila!  Nothing hurts even the next day.  Week trip to the mountains, too, pleased.  No matter how I flew, my back felt great. <br><br><h4>  Maintaining the result </h4><br>  An important part of success is the long maintenance of a painless period.  Since 12 classes in the center cost 12,000 rubles, which is essentially a penny compared to how much I spent on every crap, it still hit my pocket.  But most of the exercises could be done by yourself.  Having bought special tubular elastic bands, cuffs on the legs, having screwed an anchor bolt into the wall, I began to repeat all the most important exercises, precisely in accordance with the technique myself. <br><br>  Every morning I start with charging for the back.  The most important thing here is not to be lazy and force yourself to make it a habit.  After all, the regularity of exercise is 50% success. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Charging (neat, especially impressionable may consider it an advertisement)</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-r/uy/kv/-ruykvjjaibdvoaui7kimvxeueq.jpeg"><br></div></div><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  We will try to bring a small summar from the foregoing: <br><br><ol><li>  Refer to the medical center and remember all the exercises and the technique of their implementation; </li><li>  Exercise every morning; </li><li>  Go to the pool; </li><li>  Do not gain extra pounds; </li><li>  Do exercises for the lower back at home or in any gym; </li><li>  Stretch the back of the thigh as much as possible; </li><li>  Do not be discouraged if something does not work out, there is always a way out, work on your back, your health! </li></ol><br>  Once again.  These measures may not be suitable for you.  All diagnoses are completely different.  The main thing is to complain less and do more.  Try new methods and technologies.  If you have already overcome this ailment, I will be glad to see your story in the comments.  Good luck to everyone and straighten your back! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/448732/">https://habr.com/ru/post/448732/</a></p>
