BSA is trying with all its might to protect the copyright of programs designed to conduct business - first of all, these are well-known office suites and applications.  To do this, they conduct advertising campaigns of a different nature - sometimes, very unconventional. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A few years ago, they were <a href="https://www.plixer.com/blog/netflow/nail-your-boss-with-netflow/">marked by advertising</a> , which was ambiguously perceived by the public.  The slogan "Pin the Boss" was placed on a picture with a tie nailed to the wall and a call to report on cases of pirated use of programs via the "helpline".  Apparently, an employee of the company, having met with similar facts in his workplace, had to push his superiors in order to lose his job.  It is not known whether remuneration for lost work was paid in this case. <br><br>  Apparently, having understood the essence of the problem, BSA worked a little on the advertising campaign and in 2014 came up with another proposal - already ‚Äúset the boss‚Äù.  In a campaign that was widely carried out on the Facebook social network, the participants were offered to push the pirates and get money.  At the same time, according to all the laws of marketing, in winter they were seduced by a <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/bsa-offers-facebook-users-cash-rat-pirates-140215/">ski resort</a> , and in summer - by <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/bsa-gets-hundreds-paid-informants-rat-software-pirates-140626/">paid vacation</a> .  True, the scammers could only get money after the BSA could win a case in court from the pirates and, in turn, receive monetary compensation.  A tempting offer operated in the territories of the United States, Australia, Canada and China.  Depending on the received judicial compensation for denunciations, they promised to give up to $ 200,000.

On average, he gets about 30 pickups per month.  Therefore, it was now decided to develop the success of a new campaign in Facebook.  This time the advertisement is addressed to users who are not very prudent with their expenses.  ‚ÄúCan't pay the loan?  - <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/pay-off-your-credit-card-debts-by-ratting-on-software-pirates-150322/%3Futm_source%3Dfeedburner%26utm_medium%3Dfeed%26utm_campaign%3DFeed%253A%2BTorrentfreak%2B%2528Torrentfreak%2529">asks the text from the advertisement</a> .  Let us know about a company that uses unlicensed software, and you can get a reward. ‚Äù  As before, the gunner will receive a reward only after a successful trial, but this time its amount can reach a million dollars.  The second advertising slogan from the same campaign offered to improve their financial situation to those users who spent money during the holidays. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/760/23c/fe7/76023cfe7beb425390a7711ad8cea28d.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f4b/2d9/e9f/f4b2d9e9fd4044a3938b5909e36af0f3.jpg"><br><br>  Significantly, instead of appealing to ethics and morality, representatives of the BSA simply offer people to substitute their neighbor for money.  And at the same time it opens another interesting scheme for unfair competition. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/374803/">https://habr.com/ru/post/374803/</a></p>
