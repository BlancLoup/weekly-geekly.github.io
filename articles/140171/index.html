  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Excursion to the data center "Beeline"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today (March 17) an excursion to the VimpelCom Data Processing Center took place. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0ec/fc1/7fc/0ecfc17fc1450928640ebaebeac4bb45.jpg"><br>  In general, the very beginning, it is not even in the building of the data center: we were seated on comfortable chairs and quickly and briefly explained the obvious rules of behavior, and after leaving the dummy in the safety data sheet, we went to the adjacent building of the data center itself.  Quite a lot of photos! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  These are two mobile generators that can power the entire Center for eight hours.  It can be longer, but the diesel fuel is running out, and then, if the problem is still not resolved, - three gasoline tank trucks with diesel fuel leave from three different points, and they will carry it until it is necessary.  This is how everything is serious.  Although, as we were told, I have never had to use it :) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/053/f75/a36/053f75a368550528dff6eac81206d277.jpg"><br><br>  At the entrance to the inside, so as not to overlook the expensive servers and a no less expensive cooling system, it is necessary to put on boot covers: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f34/daa/e99/f34daae99bab8a4107404e4e5daa5e6b.jpg"><br>  Competition!  Find the quickie in the photo: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f7c/ff4/125/f7cff4125aba072823106223797c439c.jpg">

      Those two generators are nice, but in the case of an accident, the electricity usually turns off instantly, and it takes time (~ 1 minute) to start the generators, and therefore there is a whole battery room: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/230/154/494/2301544948d4af2e5449c295781555cc.jpg"><br><br>  These blue things are the batteries themselves: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/71f/ad8/d28/71fad8d28055a1fbb38fb32c88ccdb0e.jpg"><br><br>  The noisiest part of this (and the following) room is the most powerful air conditioners that maintain a temperature of 21.0 ¬± 0.1 ¬∞ C: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b1b/f90/fd7/b1bf90fd7f6178973994231165bb2a16.jpg"><br><br>  Not sure I know what it is, but it seems to be a voltage regulator, only very cool: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/598/baf/a7b/598bafa7b8325ec55ce253738472d122.jpg"><br><br>  Here is a large storage of "hard drives" (tape library).  There would be nothing remarkable in it if it were not for the mechanical ‚Äúhand‚Äù inside, which periodically moves cartridges from place to place: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9e5/05d/af4/9e505daf4b487f78b484a02424c478b2.jpg"><br>  Unfortunately, because of the mirror glass, I was not able to get a more beautiful and clear image from my old DSLR.  I admit that this is due to the integrity of my hands. <br><br>  And a few more photos: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/da1/05f/c4b/da105fc4b9fe638721a2dad83d14dbaa.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e58/01c/716/e5801c716e7ea6cca2777b9f5807b0ee.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b6d/d5c/e6e/b6dd5ce6e10dacce6b53de5fbe55cf41.jpg"><br>  By the way, this uncle, which is pictured above, is an extremely competent specialist and manager.  One feels a great experience and ability to lead a conversation. <br><br>  These five cabinets are the largest disk storage (it is not clear only - the largest where?): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/646/d6e/6fa/646d6e6fa4aae2921e4057a01202312f.jpg"><br><br>  And of course, where is the Sun without?  This is the previous generation of Hi-end servers (this whole bandura is <b>one</b> physical server). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b5f/d1e/144/b5fd1e144d5ec3beb8c252232c529066.jpg"><br>  Its view from the back, when viewed from above, is very much like a coffee machine :) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/583/1c1/1a5/5831c11a5a92bcba6460695e4f74087c.jpg"><br><br>  Next to it is a hi-end server of the very latest generation.  As we were told, it is possible to change everything in it, without having to turn it off - all this time it will work in normal mode (in the photo you can see the view from the open wall of the server cabinet): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d86/563/bd6/d86563bd664702a9db54a553e3d8ff38.jpg"><br><br>  Raised floor  Since the system allocates average amounts of energy by industrial standards, a simple scheme is used: cold air is blown from the bottom and hot air is drawn from the top.  The mixing of air between the floor and the ceiling is released to the will by convection forces.  (in more severe cases, so-called hot and cold corridors are used, much has been written about this).  And this is how the underground looks like: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/526/7d0/a0a/5267d0a0a44b422926e7eb547ba16781.jpg"><br><br>  And only at the very end, we were told that the whole room was hung with cameras, and the mice running through were destroyed by an ultra-precise laser-guided system: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/57c/b9c/c2e/57cb9cc2e71d2b85b80aff048de84f6a.jpg"><br>  Such cameras are around the perimeter of the room: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/056/dfd/fe0/056dfdfe036c487529781adff81c5563.jpg"><br><br>  The end :) Not to say that I wrote and laid out absolutely everything that we were told and shown, but the other photos are embarrassing, because they are either overexposed or blurred: (I hope there will be more reviews from other participants! <br><br>  PS: They also promised to organize an excursion to the call-center, so follow the "events" on Habr√©! <br>  PPS: Oh yes!  The cookies were!  At the very end we were taken back to the hall where we could drink coffee / tea with cookies (!).  There, we were shown a top-secret plan for the Beeline data center device (he was asked not to photograph), and also given the opportunity to ask some questions. <br>  PPPS: Before minimizing karma, you can write what you didn‚Äôt like in the posted photos from the excursion I was able to attend. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/140171/">https://habr.com/ru/post/140171/</a></p>
