Well, at least with the money, there are no problems now. ‚ÄùImmersed in thought, he did not notice how a pretty effective girl sat down at his table.</font>  <font>Stylishly dressed blonde with blue eyes looked out of place in this institution.</font>  <font>In her too smooth movements, it was noticeable that she was drunk.</font> <font>

    </font>  <font>‚ÄúWhy are you carrying this anachronism around your neck?‚Äù</font>  <font>This is DDR2, today you can hardly find where to stick this thing.</font>  <font>- The girl started the conversation quite unceremoniously.</font>  <font>- Are you a programmer?</font> <font><br><br></font>  <font>The surprise instantly vomited him out of his thoughts.</font> <font><br><br></font>  <font>- Do you understand computers?</font>  <font>- Sergey pretended that he did not understand the hidden meaning in the girl's remark, although something was moving inside him.</font> <font><br><br></font>  <font>- Well, firstly, not you, but you, and secondly, my brother is obsessed with computer hardware, will unwittingly begin to understand.</font>  <font>So who are you, a programmer, or a sysadmin?</font> <font><br><br></font>  <font>Sergey was more accustomed to text messengers than to verbal communication, and even with the opposite sex.</font>  <font>He tried to smile.</font> <font><br><br></font>  <font>- I program a little.</font>  <font>Is it really so clear to me?</font> <font><br></font>  <font>- Of those present only on your desk an empty mug stands next to the full one.</font> <font><br><br></font>  <font>Sergey laughed, the girl was definitely starting to like him.</font>  <font>The blonde continued to attack.</font> <font><br><br></font>  <font>- Listen, friend, let's clean up.</font>  <font>I know that you, programmers, are modest and cultured people, don't offend the girl, and I have a little problem here.</font>  <font>I passed through your hole, came to my boyfriend, but we quarreled as usual.</font>  <font>All because of his laziness.</font>  <font>I need to spend the night somewhere, and in the morning I can make it up.</font>  <font>But unfortunately, all two of your hotels are overcrowded, and I have no friends or friends here.</font>  <font>Do not shelter me for the night?</font>  <font>By the way, I'm Melissa.</font> <font><br><br></font>  <font>The girl rattled these words in just a couple of seconds.</font>  <font>Even modern computers would need efforts to process so much scattered information, and Sergey drank today three beer mugs.</font> <font><br><br></font>  <font>- Melissa?</font>  <font>Very nice, I'm Sergey.</font> <font><br></font>  <font>- exe, Serge.</font>  <font>So what?</font>  <font>I do not bite and do not borrow much space.</font>  <font>It is now almost one in the morning, and at nine in the morning I will run away.</font> <font><br><br></font>  <font>Sergey finally realized that the girl wants to stay the night with him.</font>  <font>For a long time a woman has not visited his house.</font>  <font>Solid deadlines at work, and then a new project, which takes almost all the time and effort.</font>  <font>In the end, this is his legitimate weekend, who knows when next time luck will smile to be alone with such a beautiful girl.</font>  <font>On the other hand, he only recognized her name two minutes ago.</font> <font><br></font>  <font>The girl noticed his hesitation, pretended that she was embarrassed by her speed and took out her communicator.</font> <font><br><br></font>  <font>- Listen, let me cry to you.</font>  <font>Two hundred enough?</font>  <font>What account to transfer money to?</font> <font><br></font>  <font>- No, no, no money!</font>  <font>Leave yourself.</font>  <font>Then let's go?</font>  <font>I live near here.</font> <font><br></font>  <font>- Okay, finish your beer, and while I buy a bottle of wine for us to come to sleep.</font> <font><br><br></font>  <font>They left the bar, and Melissa took Sergey's arm.</font>  <font>From her touch, pleasant goosebumps ran all over his body.</font>  <font>They walked in silence, Melissa‚Äôs fervor was intimidated, but Sergei could not come up with topics for conversation other than computers.</font> <font><br><br></font>  <font>- Here we come.</font>  <font>The dwelling is modest, but I have three computers at home.</font>  <font>Although you are probably not interested?</font> <font><br></font>  <font>- Where do you work, what do you need so many computers?</font> <font><br></font>  <font>- In Google.</font>  <font>- In the voice of Sergei sounded pride.</font> <font><br></font>  <font>- Oh, yes, I know this company, they still have nice colors on the site for the holidays.</font>  <font>Do you draw them?</font> <font><br></font>  <font>‚ÄúWell, actually, I'm doing more serious things.‚Äù</font>  <font>But they are not for general use yet.</font>  <font>And soon will be.</font>  <font>The case is secret.</font>  <font>- Sergey was harassed by ‚Äúcolors‚Äù and wanted to impress the girl.</font> <font><br></font>  <font>- Come on, Serge.</font>  <font>I'm so drunk that I won't remember your name anymore in a day!</font>  <font>Tell me, please, I am very interested!</font> <font><br></font>  <font>‚ÄúWell ...‚Äù Sergey paused for a moment.</font>  <font>Then he showed a red mark on the neck, near the nape.</font>  <font>- I am one of the testers direct connection of man and computer.</font>  <font>We implant a special chip.</font>  <font>Still very far from conscious communication management.</font>  <font>But we have achieved interaction with the subconscious.</font>  <font>During the day we work with computers as usual, and at night, during sleep, we connect special equipment for communication to testers.</font>  <font>Such a symbiosis allows you to solve some problems faster than existing supercomputers can.</font>  <font>Roughly speaking, the device asks the subconscious a question and immediately receives an answer.</font>  <font>But for now we have a lot of problems.</font>  <font>Frequent headaches, memory loss.</font>  <font>But the most important is the compatibility of the chip and the people.</font> <font><br><br></font>  <font>Melissa's eyes were strangely darkened.</font>  <font>For a moment, the girl looked like a concentrated bird of prey.</font>  <font>Sergey was fascinated by the story and did not notice anything.</font> <font><br><br></font>  <font>- Chip connection invented recently.</font>  <font>At first, when he was tested on people far from computers, there was almost no feedback.</font>  <font>We were lucky, someone offered to test the chip on computer scientists.</font>  <font>But even so, over the past six months, at the best testers, the response from the chip did not exceed one percent.</font>  <font>And my compatibility reaches ten, sometimes even twelve percent.</font>  <font>That's why they clung to me like that.</font>  <font>I have the last day off, and then I'm stuck in the lab for a long time.</font>  <font>But you can not imagine what a thrill it is.</font>  <font>Of course, the subconscious does most of the work, but sometimes I also feel contact.</font>  <font>Information ... It flashes past like glowing snowflakes.</font>  <font>It seems to be similar to each other, but all are unique, although related to each other.</font>  <font>And any snowflake I can catch, bring closer, feel ... And the closer one node is, the more interconnection threads I see.</font>  <font>This is an indescribable feeling ...</font> <font><br><br></font>  <font>Melissa defiantly yawned.</font> <font><br><br></font>  <font>- Listen, Serge, this is all very cool ... But I would still go to sleep better, would you mind?</font>  <font>- By the tone it was a statement rather than a question.</font>  <font>‚ÄúJust give us some wine to sleep better.‚Äù</font>  <font>Do you have glasses?</font> <font><br></font>  <font>- Hmm ... Well, okay.</font>  <font>Just a word to no one about what I said.</font>  <font>Glasses in the kitchen, find?</font> <font><br></font>  <font>- Yeah.</font> <font><br><br></font>  <font>Having poured wine, the girl took a vial from her pocket and threw a pink pill into one glass, which, having hissed, instantly dissolved.</font>  <font>Taking a communicator out of her pocket, she quickly typed a message: ‚ÄúI found it, 12%!</font>  <font>In ten minutes he will be blacked out.</font>  <font>Drive the car closer to the door, you have to do everything quickly. "</font>  <font>When she put the device in her purse, a ray of light hit the dark blue card-pass, which lay in the upper compartment.</font>  <font>‚ÄúMicrosoft‚Äù was written in black on the card ...</font> &lt;/ lj-cut&gt; </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/20441/">https://habr.com/ru/post/20441/</a></p>
