I have never been a professional programmer and did not try to especially follow any rules and standards when I had to write something on the bash and then on the python.  I just solved my small admin tasks on that PL which was at hand, stepping on every rake I came across.  And it‚Äôs just as easy and in admin‚Äôs way to the point that professional programmers probably know how to pop the 9 commandments. <br>  After killing a day on debug bash script written in an hour, I realized that bash is suitable almost exclusively for one-liners.  Having tried to store the instances of my own classes in text files, I understood why I needed an orm, and after working with my own code of the one-year excerpt I realized that I wanted to write comments. <br>  Nobody taught me this, no one demanded that I fulfill any code-writing rules, but their meaning reached me with utmost clarity, and since then there was no desire to ignore them. <br>  Here I am a complete fool and proud of it. <br><br><h5>  Razdolbay </h5>

      But in some questions I am not up to the fool, and I walk on the same rake again and again.  I guess I even get up to rake and start jumping.  So I get to know the art of working with people. <br>  It all started with an attempt to find an application to many familiar gibberish.  Dolly - it seems to be a good person, with whom it is pleasant to drink beer and talk, but for one reason or another did not find a way to bring benefits to society.  Such individuals usually suffer from a lack of money for beer and know a lot of reasons why trying to find a cool job and earning a beer in their case is doomed to failure and is meaningless. <br>  Among such reasons are usually the absence of higher education, lack of experience in anything other than drinking beer, inability to do uninteresting and mechanical work, lack of health, old age (24 years), etc. <br>  And at this moment I appear with a similar love for beer, laziness, unwillingness to do a boring job, abandoned by the university and a great love for people.  I appear and think - they are the same as me, but they didn‚Äôt say that IT is a real paradise for gnawing, where you are guided only by curiosity on the one hand and laziness on the other you become a first-class specialist who doesn‚Äôt even have to go to work and wake up before noon, you just need to drag your ass from the bed to the computer and get money by doing what you love the most. <br>  And now I tell my friends, dolt, that I know the cheat code from reality, and that they need to urgently become sysadmins, and that I will help them in this completely free of charge and completely. <br>  To do this, I have to donate my outdated desktop with a monitor, keyboard and mouse, pay them for the Internet month, print a couple of books about Linux, write to the livecd disc and show how to boot from it and get the root console.  Then I tell and show how awesome cool and logical Linux is for N hours and pretty tired, I finally go to work.  A similar scenario was repeated with a dozen razdolbaev. <br>  A month later, some gibberies drank an outdated desktop, others sat down on DotA, and still others took up arms at me, saying that I was trying to use them.  Not a single dolphine became a Linux user. <br>  After that, I was depressed on the basis of disappointment in people.  I have been puzzled for months trying to understand why these people find the strength to live without their favorite beer, but they cannot take the easy way.  It is much easier to fight for your right to beer than to accept its absence.  Is not it so? <br>  And time after time I refused to understand the truth written in large print on the handle of this rake: " <b>people do not change</b> " <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Nietzsche </h5><br><br>  Six months ago, one of my former employers wrote to me and offered a 50% share in his startup.  The conditions for this startup were simply fabulous, it seemed, and even now it seems that in such conditions this startup cannot but take off.  So cool were the conditions that it was even somehow unsportsmanlike - to do this startup in these conditions. <br>  There was only one ‚Äúbut‚Äù in this all - this person had already tried to make this startup in these conditions and had filled him up, which I witnessed.  The reason for the failure seems to have been the absolute incompetence of its technical specialists, and this time the technical side of the startup should have been my responsibility.  And I did.  For six months, I made a product that has no equal in runet, I launched a startup and brought it to self-sufficiency.  But I cursed the day when I fit into all this, because most of the work was to correct the mistakes and mistakes of the partner.  When he was kosyachil, a technical team led by me gritted his teeth, tightened his belts and found a way to correct the consequences of his mistakes.  And the more we worked, the less my partner worked. <br>  I tried to criticize him, inspire him, flatter him, scare him, narrow his area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility, forgive him and continue in the intervals between correcting his jambs to do his job well, but he continued to do nothing or break everything.  In the end, he said that he was not obliged to do anything at all, and 50% relied on him as the author of the idea.  My former partner is the only one given to fill up this sitartap in these ideal conditions for him. <br>  Suddenly I looked at the rake that was moving on the handle and read what I so long ago refused to believe: <br>  " <b>people do not change</b> " <br>  He still failed the project, and as always I refused to surrender.  Now I continue to develop this startup in less ideal conditions, but without the destructive influence of the former partner and as the sole owner of this project. <br><br><h4>  People do not change </h4><br><br>  Regardless of the circumstances and conditions, the person in each of his decisions and actions manifests his essence and role - the inventor will invent even working as a janitor, the pedant will be pedantic even in making a mess, the victim of circumstances will even be a victim, and the winner will lose the victory even after losing.  I am a fool, I learn from my mistakes until they finish me off. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/215125/">https://habr.com/ru/post/215125/</a></p>
