  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to pack a startup</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Among customers who come to us (at Defa Interaktiv and Plenum) for the site, it is easy to find out who came not from a business that really needs a website, but from an online startup. <br>  The start-up only thinks that he came for the site, in fact, he comes for us to do business to him and, in fact, turned his ethereal idea into a brand. <br><br>  Actually, he often comes back to the seed investor (whose function is not in creating a business from an idea), but about this a little further, everything is in order. <br><br>  Obviously, the fundamental difference between online startups from all other startups is that the site is a business.  Structure, interface, functionality, navigation, ergonomics, design - part of the business, which the online starter has (with the idea) yet, and not just the attributes of the site.  And branding - that is, positioning, a promotion strategy, the search for a ‚Äúbig idea‚Äù - are normal and obligatory parts of any working business, and not what can be done at the start, not to devote too much time and attention.

      Usually we see the following picture: <br><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1726910/esquisse_copy.png" alt="startupers"><br><a name="habracut"></a>  On the one hand, a start-up, an idealist, if there were no idealists, the business would not move.  To create and develop a business, and the economy as a whole, we need ideas that inspire.  At the beginning of the path, the idealist has only creativity.  He mistakenly believes that the idea is equal to a ready-made business that brings in money, and it is enough to present the project to a sid-investor in the notorious two-minute pitch and get the desired investments. <br><br>  On the other hand - the investor.  He is not inspired by ideas, as a rule.  He knows that business is done with a toolkit, not with ideas.  An investor is looking for a development function for money in a startup (be it his money, or the money of a portfolio investor).  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa startup is equal to the cost of the investor.  The more the idea and the promise promised at the end, the more it will take to take the risk.  The investor tries in vain to speak with a startup in his own language and gets the dialogue of the blind with the deaf.  In response to each argument of the investor - the slogan of a startup.  ‚ÄúYou will not earn ...‚Äù - ‚ÄúWe will do it!‚Äù, Etc. <br><br>  A unique business does not begin with unique ideas.  Today's online success is a game of nuances: most of the ideas of online businesses on the market are either copycats or sister cities (like facebook and VKontakte).  The bottom line is that the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbusiness is one (for example, to make smartphones), but the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe brand is different, and it is special (the most popular smartphone in the world is not ... a smartphone, but an IPhone). <br><br>  It is important to understand that ergonomics, the structure of the site is part of the online business brand.  Many sites sell tickets: in fact, the whole business is different prototype.  The functions of one online startup differ from one another in trifles.  But the devil of the result - in the details, in positioning and a clear focus on their own, specific audience, with certain insights. <br><br>  In all start-up forums, they are taught to quickly and clearly convey the essence of their idea within two minutes, but they do not learn to pack their idea into a brand shell.  To bring an investor is not an idea, but a brand, which is designed to address the specific needs of people.  Not only rational, but also emotional. <br><br>  All the truths about the situation in the startup field - not just our opinion, but the experience confirmed by the tandem of <a href="http://defa.ru/">Defa Interaktiv</a> and <a href="http://www.plenum.ru/">Plenum</a> : in the framework of the project <a href="http://www.digitalstart.biz/">‚ÄúDigital start‚Äù</a> we, using all our expertise in building online businesses, helped start projects as zoomby.ru, amargo.ru, fidel.ru, multura.ru, proreport.ru and others. <br><br>  We treat brand building as an applied business task.  Our usual work is technical study, detailing and speaking an idea that does not change its essence and preserves its value.  Our goal is not to dissuade, but to help sell the idea to the investor. <br><br>  On the formulation, development / refinement of selling ideas, we ate all the shepherd dogs from the cynological service and know for sure that the investor does not need to bring chocolate, even if it is very high quality, He is interested in wrapping, packaging, your knowledge of the place on the shelf where this chocolate is most effective. will be sold.  In other words, he is not interested in a crude idea, but in a well-designed brand of the future business, competently presenting which is the main task at the meeting with the investor. <br><br>  The formula is simple, you need to go through five steps: Idea-Name-Logo-Prototype-Design.  But only in such a sequence and nothing else.  At the output we get two important things: <br><br>  1. Packed idea claimed by the consumer <br>  2. The order in the head <br><br>  Investors by such projects do not pass. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/128038/">https://habr.com/ru/post/128038/</a></p>
