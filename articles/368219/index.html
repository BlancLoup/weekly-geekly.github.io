A suitable tablet was found, and two problems arose: fastening the tablet to the wall and its power.  Ready-made solutions did not fit for several reasons, firstly they hurt expensively, secondly their design provided a large distance from the wall, which I didn‚Äôt like painfully, I wanted to be placed as close as possible to the wall.  Thirdly, I did not find anything suitable in the city and I would have to order the mount from China.  Although maybe I was just looking bad.  As a result, it was decided to make the bracket yourself. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Since  the tablet was supposed to be used not only to display information, but also as an IP camera using the front camera of the tablet, it was necessary to provide the required angle in the mounting design so that the camera looked ‚Äúwhere it should be‚Äù. <br>  Foamed polypropylene with a thickness of 3 mm was chosen as the material for manufacturing.  A very cool thing, you can buy from a advertiser for a penny, it is easy to cut with a regular stationery knife, it is glued with ‚Äúsuper glue‚Äù quickly and tightly.  In short, not the material, but a pleasure.  As a result, such a design was developed. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Some photos</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9d3/b76/4f9/9d3b764f9d2446b48397940a87c2f961.JPG"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/149/50c/f31/14950cf3171b4f7d86d3d2cc8707925b.JPG"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e87/cfc/fd4/e87cfcfd45944b9e927e3bce18f4b531.JPG"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/abc/9fc/8fe/abc9fc8feda9488e9d5891bf5cf57f13.JPG"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/546/e05/50e/546e0550e49643a0a279ae9b189d568e.JPG"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2a3/34a/df5/2a334adf54aa48d4a2b13f6151b37c29.JPG"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c70/2a9/b66/c702a9b66d874989b5410905d51225a0.JPG"><br></div></div><br><br>  It consists of two parts, the first is attached to the wall with screws, the tablet itself is attached to the second.  Fastening the tablet to the bracket borrowed from the cover, bought in China.  It is made of four paper clips and a panty gum.  The two halves are connected through a groove-spike connection installed at the required angle (the required angle is established during development :-)).  Fastened securely, not noticeable, and can always be disassembled.  Initially it was supposed to make a rotary structure with a servo drive, but it was decided to first make a regular mount for testing, and as they say, nothing more permanent than a temporary one. <br><br>  Now about the second problem - the power of the tablet.  Since  the tablet was located directly above the switch, then I would like to take power from there, but where can I get power in the switch?  Of course, it would be possible to cheat in the soldering box, but they were lost after the repair and did not want to look for them.  The fact is that the switch is double, and the chandelier used in this room is designed only for one phase.  There is a phase in the switch, it remains to find a zero, which was forwarded according to the supposed second phase, switched on by the second half of the switch.  Words failed to explain, so I will show on the diagram. <br>  It was: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4df/56e/930/4df56e930e43415ba3d02bc38564ea0c.png"><br>  It became: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/301/d33/01c/301d3301c86b43728a08b0c3bd09a33f.png">

      A board was connected to the resulting zero and phase, pulled out of unnecessary charging from a tablet (smartphone) of suitable power and hidden behind a switch.  (photo did not, sorry).  A wire to the tablet bracket is pulled out, on the second end of which a USB connector for charging wire is placed. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/928/4c2/7d2/9284c27d24a049369fd2aecc19217396.JPG"><br>  (from the side, you can see the children‚Äôs cave paintings, it‚Äôs too painful for this corner) <br><br>  Works, raises no objections. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/368219/">https://habr.com/ru/post/368219/</a></p>
