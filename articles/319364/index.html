Perhaps their answers will help to identify some general patterns, useful tips that will help many of us. <br><br>  Today our guest is Alexander Matrosov, <a href="https://www.cylance.com/">Cylance</a> , Principal Research Scientist.  Prior to that, he headed the UEFI firmware security business at the Intel Security Center of Excellence. <a name="habracut"></a>

      <b>What do you do in the company?</b> <br><br>  I have been engaged in practical information security for more than 15 years (laughs).  Now I focus more on reverse analysis of software and automation of these processes.  In the past few years, I have been concerned about the safety of the UEFI platform, as well as the interaction points of modern OS and BIOS. <br><br>  <b>One phrase (phrase) best describes how you work:</b> <br><br>  Search for needles in a haystack. <br><br>  <b>Do you live in Moscow?</b> <br><br>  I was born and lived in Moscow for a long time and still love this city.  But a few years ago, I moved to Portland, Oregon. <br><br>  <b>How long does the road take?</b> <br><br>  15 minutes.  But I work from home a few days a week, and then it's less than a minute (smiles). <br><br>  <b>How do you spend your time on the road?</b> <br><br>  I'm driving a car.  I listen to podcasts and audiobooks. <br><br>  <b>How many hours a day do you spend on work?</b> <br><br>  In addition to work, I also have my own projects, which can also be called work.  Therefore, it goes about 15 hours and more. <br><br>  <b>How many hours do you sleep?</b> <br><br>  I try 8 hours.  The key word is ‚Äútry‚Äù (laughs). <br><br>  <b>Do you have breakfast</b> <br><br>  I have breakfast and I think that this is an important part of the morning awakening ritual (smiles).  I prefer granola with yogurt or with Brazilian acai fruit.  It is a good energy and antioxidant.  In front of the office, I usually take a big latte at a coffee shop nearby. <br><br>  <b>What kind of todo-manager do you use personally?</b> <br><br>  I don‚Äôt really like todo-managers, but without them it‚Äôs hard when tasks get over the second dozen.  As a rule, I record notes during rallies in a regular notebook.  I also use Evernote.  The built-in todo-manager in MS Outlook got pretty good.  But lately I have been eyeing the Todoist service and I‚Äôve been increasingly trying to use it as part of my own projects. <br><br>  <b>What issue tracker'om / repository do you use?</b> <br><br>  At work, this is GitLab, JIRA and Confluence.  For my projects, I have long been hooked on Github. <br><br>  <b>Do you have any internal projects or libraries in your company and why were they created?</b> <br><br>  The company has a fairly widespread practice of microprojects that solve particular tasks and automate routine processes within a team or interaction between employees.  In fact, my current company is a start-up that once grew from such an internal mini-project in machine learning to a pioneer company in the application of artificial intelligence technologies to detect malware. <br><br>  <b>What annoys you most when you work?</b> <br><br>  In principle, people annoy me for the most part and especially in open space (laughs). <br><br>  <b>What professional literature would you recommend?</b> <br><br>  Good question, here, probably, you can bring a huge list of books, it all depends on the tasks.  But I can definitely recommend the book that I wrote myself - <a href="https://www.nostarch.com/rootkits">Rootkits and Bootkits: Reversing Modern Malware and Next Generation Threats</a> . <br><br>  <b>What technology (computers, tablets, smartphones) and operating systems do you prefer at work and at home?</b> <br><br>  I am quite happy with my Lenovo Thinkpad with Intel Skylake on board.  From OS I got accustomed to MS Windows 10. From phones I prefer Apple iPhone.  I tried several times to transfer to OSX, but it did not work out because of the main focus in working on MS products. <br><br>  <b>Do you listen to music when you work?</b> <br><br>  I prefer silence and for this I often use headphones with active noise cancellation.  Any music distracts me in the process of work, when I need to focus and be focused. <br><br>  <b>Which life hack allows you to be more efficient?</b> <br><br>  Do not drink too much coffee.  This leads to sad consequences and migraines.  When working on a complex task, it is not always possible to control this process, and as a result it only harms the result. <br><br>  <b>What applications and services can you do without in your work or in your personal life?</b> <br><br>  IDA Pro and Intel x86 platform. <br><br>  <b>What would Alexander Matrosov write in a letter to future generations?</b> <br><br>  I would advise to read paper literature along with e-books.  Paper books not only provide information, but also involve in a kind of ‚Äúmeditative‚Äù process. <br><br>  <b>You have come a long way.</b>  <b>And someone is now at the beginning of this path.</b>  <b>What would you recommend to a person trying to go the same way?</b> <br><br>  Do not get scattered: choose a direction, focus on it and achieve results.  If something does not work, do not hesitate to ask others or find like-minded people.  And most importantly, when achieving goals, set new ones even more ambitious. <br><br>  I also recommend listening to <a href="http://noisebit.ru/">Noise Security Bit Podcast</a> , which we do with famous Russian-speaking researchers in the field of information security. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/319364/">https://habr.com/ru/post/319364/</a></p>
