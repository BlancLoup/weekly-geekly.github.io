With perseverance, worthy of a better use, people continue to use free mailboxes or, as it is now becoming fashionable, personal messaging services in popular social networks.  networks.  The example with the site gosuslugi.ru is indicative, where you can see how many official state institutions of Russia use free mail in their work so densely that they don‚Äôt even have the thought to indicate the corporate email address (if it exists at all).  According to statistics published by Ivan Begtin at <a href="http://ivbeg.livejournal.com/364050.html">ivbeg.livejournal.com/364050.html</a> , it turns out as much as 22.5%.  What pushes people to such behavior?  Is there a reasonable explanation for that, or is it all just plain faintness, lack of money and laziness? <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The flow of spam, breaking through all sorts of obstacles, noise statistical filters, using hacked accounts of living people in normal mail systems for their distribution, led to the fact that anti-spam measures were taken almost everywhere, somewhere by its own IT departments, somewhere were outsourced specialized companies, and somewhere just implemented a commercial solution "turnkey".  They are related by the fact that administrators can check (and check) the performance of their mail system on a dozen other most popular domains and directions used in vip-correspondence.  And that's all.  And what will happen if neither the sender nor the recipient were ‚Äúrehearsed‚Äù in advance on the filters of the system?  At present, the picture of the interaction of postal systems is such that neither users nor administrators of postal systems can be sure that letters go anywhere, except for some of the most popular, and therefore tested directions, and not all the time.  Any letter that satisfies two simple conditions will most likely not be delivered.  The first is that the letter should not be sent through a popular free mail service (or a large company‚Äôs SaaS service) and the second should be sent to a popular free mail service (or a large company‚Äôs SaaS service), a good aggravating condition would be if the company has internal mail service. turnover is more external.

      At the same time, despite the RFC and the practice that has developed over the years, the ordinary administrator of a small mail server has no guarantees that the letters of his system will not be wrapped up by that side due to the fact that they simply want to.  The biggest gains from the current situation are large SaaS providers that provide cloud-based email services.  The expanded commercial network based on the free mail systems of these companies is covered by a subscriber base of millions and sometimes hundreds of millions of users.  Thanks to this, the email will come.  Thus, it turns out that a medium-sized company doesn‚Äôt have much choice when using a mail solution, especially considering that the cost of a local exchange server ($ 700 at a time + $ 70 per person) would be nice to immediately add gooogle postini ($ 15 per person) or something similar.  Small companies immediately sit on Yandex for a domain (1000 boxes at a time, then on request), and very large companies immediately take SaaS with a clear SLA ($ 50 / year per user from google) or put IronPort on the perimeter, basically not spitting on external correspondents. <br><br>  So it turns out that users who still need to ‚Äúgo, not checkers,‚Äù if the company spent on licenses and hardware for the server, but did not connect its mail service to one of the ‚Äúbig brothers‚Äù (because of savings, policies oragization, confidentiality conditions or 152-FZ), after several unsuccessful attempts to communicate through fenced off corporate servers, quietly use free services, without thinking about either a trade secret or the consequences of dropping the box. <br><br>  What is this if not the slow death of the current equal postal network in the form in which we are all used to it?  We'll see how soon a corporate facebook account will become an integral part of our life. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/115896/">https://habr.com/ru/post/115896/</a></p>
