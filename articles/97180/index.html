  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Time machine for your business</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Friends, for sure everyone has heard about the most famous ‚Äútime machine‚Äù in business.  But how to use it and how it works very few people understand.  In this post I tried to consider these issues in more detail. <br><br>  It is generally recognized that the Runet lags behind Burzhunet by an average of 3-5 years.  Thus, what is popular with them now comes to us (not all of course, but most) in 3-5 years.  The situation is similar with Runet, Bynet and Ukrnet.  Only now Runet ahead, and the backlog is not so serious - up to 3 years.  If you look wider, we can notice a similar situation with the capital and the province.  For example, the market for developing and promoting websites in the regions is an order of magnitude behind Moscow and St. Petersburg. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  What do we get? </h4><br>  And we get a real ‚Äútime machine‚Äù that can and should be used.  Just look at the market ahead of you, and correctly select an idea that is gaining or already popular there.  In the reserve you will have 1-3 years minimum.  For examples, you don‚Äôt need to go far to Vkontakte and Facebook, social games, SaaS model, etc. <br><br><h4>  What is important to consider? </h4><br>  It should be borne in mind that the markets are different, and what is popular there may not be very popular with us.  Therefore, copying the idea one-on-one is not always good.  It is necessary to adapt to our realities and mentality. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      You also need to understand that it is possible too early (or late) to launch an idea on the market.  For example, you caught a fresh trend in Burzhunete, which is rapidly gaining popularity, implemented it in RuNet, but such a crushing success did not happen.  And all because you started too early!  The market is not yet ready or does not feel the need for your product.  I will explain on the chart. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d20/c01/61a/d20c0161a781ad21b80c66c0d4a14260.png" alt="image"><br>  The red curve shows the development of the market.  Starting at the <b>moment 1 is</b> still too early, you will either create the market yourself, or you will have to wait until it starts to grow.  In both cases, you can not live to the moment 2. <b>Moment 2 is the</b> most optimal for the start - the market begins to emerge and it becomes clear that it will grow.  Well, at the <b>moment 3 it</b> is usually too late to do anything - a huge competition. A vivid example of a late start is soc.  network Recall.ru.  Despite advertising on television and a huge budget, the market has already been formed and sawn. <br><br><h4>  Where to begin? </h4><br>  First of all, you need to decide for what market you will make the product.  For example, if this is a regional market, we look at the trends of Moscow and St. Petersburg.  If this is a project under the Runet - we are looking for interesting ideas over the hill.  You can take a <a href="http://www.google.com/adplanner/static/top1000/">rating from Google</a> and go through it thoroughly.  You can also dig into Digg.com or Alexa.com. <br><br>  And here‚Äôs another interesting tool from Google <a href="http://www.google.ru/trends">http://www.google.com/trends</a> .  With it, you can analyze the change in the number of requests that prompts trends. <br><br>  I hope this small review will help you find new original ideas for your projects.  Successes! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/97180/">https://habr.com/ru/post/97180/</a></p>
