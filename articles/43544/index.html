  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Fighting offenders on the Internet - a new way</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I decided to tell a story that happened to me and my website this week.  I'll start from far away - that everything would be clear.  In view of my activities, in addition to the main work and the feasible content of my site, I still administer the unofficial CMS support site and its forum <i>(which I will not write - there‚Äôs enough advertising already)</i> , and it often happens that you have to ban users or other violations.  Naturally dissatisfied very much, this was to be expected. <br><br>  The guys took revenge in different ways - threats, ddos-attacks, etc. ... But yesterday an abnormally large number of transitions from the forums appeared in the list of links to my site.  In order to find out the reason, I decided to visit several of them.  It turned out all of these forums were slipped ... "advertising" my site.  I will not give the text of published topics - there are children here, we will not hurt them.  If you put aside all ambitions, then what is wrong you say?  However, just here there is only harm - inappropriate traffic is the most innocuous thing that threatens me, but as a ‚Äúcapital‚Äù measure of punishment, which spammers apparently calculated, this is a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãcomplaints about spam in Yandex, Google, etc., and as a result in BL and falling out of issue.  For my site with a attendance of just over 300 unique per day, this would mean inevitable death. <br><br>  I had to urgently write letters to the support services of Yandex, Google and explain the situation, write off with the Administrators of the forums in order to delete the messages, and of course on the main page I had a big announcement - you were deceived!

      PS: Yesterday, a letter arrived at the post office, its content indicated that this is the organizer of these spam mailings to the forums.  After a long correspondence with the use of such words about which I did not know before - they came to the following, I quote: <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><blockquote>  Oh, my God ... Denis ... <br><br>  I am on you, you are on me ... and both, as it turned out and not in the business :) <br>  Yes, ardor and haste is a sin. </blockquote><br><br>  Here's a way to deal with competitors or just offenders, I learned on myself. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> Today, November 13, this story got its continuation, it turned out that the site that I admin was advertised in the same way.  Plus, a very strong attack on the forum went, the BOT sent a PM from the forum, while I was driving home - 3 hours, the server load under the aggregate workload + ddos ‚Äã‚Äã+ BOT activity increased to a critical, in the Exima line there were ~ 60,000 letters generated IPB is influenced by BOT.  The IPB has obvious problems with this - today several more forums under the control of this engine have been flashed in the same way. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/43544/">https://habr.com/ru/post/43544/</a></p>
