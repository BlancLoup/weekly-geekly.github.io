  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Free software at school or three days spent with benefit</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><habracut><br><h5>  How it all began </h5><br>  The story began with the fact that I called to consult a friend on a single issue.  Since recently, the beginning of this year, he began working as an informatics teacher in a local school.  The fact is that a commission from the region with a check was supposed to arrive at the school during the week.  They will check all sorts of documentation to see if the learning conditions are in line with the required ones, and of course they will surely give their attention to a new computer class.  My friend was warned that computers should work perfectly, they should be exclusively licensed software, as for any kind of "pirates" the school will be imposed a fine penalty.  All anything, but only the licensed software in the class was not since its inception.  Money for the purchase of licensed software by the school did not stand out, so all kinds of animals and other pearls of the creation of Captain Flint felt great on all computers. <br><habracut><br><br><h5>  Day 1 </h5><br>  On the first day a rough work plan and a plan for its implementation were drawn up.  Since the school does not finance the purchase of licensed software, it was decided to abandon pirated proprietary and completely switch to free, free software. <br>  Of course, you need to write about computers that are installed in this computer class.  They are powerful enough for educational purposes, they are more than enough.  Judging by the label on the system unit, they were collected in 2009.  The total number of 15 pieces.  This is what each computer was: <br><br>  Intel core 2 duo e4600 2.4GHz <br>  1Gb Ram DDR2 800 <br>  ASRock G41, 775, Onboard video <br>  Hitachi 160 Gb Sata <br>  Noname 350 W <br>  Benq LCD 19 ‚Äù

      As the OS, several options were considered, among them Ubuntu, Alt, Suse, Fedora.  As a result, the choice fell on Ubuntu.  It remained to find alternative versions of programs used in Windows for Linux.  Below is a table with a list of alternative application software: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/7fc72702/590b1754/c8a71e08/d115bc0c.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Day 2 </h5><br>  The image of the system was downloaded from the official site, burned to disk and rushed!  All about everything was the weekend.  Looking ahead, I will say that about 18 man-hours were spent on all the work.  So that the work went quickly, it was decided to record two system images and install in parallel on several computers.  During the installation process, there were no special problems; everything went quickly and smoothly.  Since computers had access to the Internet, most of the updates were received during the installation process.  Under the system drive, it was decided to allocate 25GB., Under the user the remaining 120GB.  For the first day, we jointly installed the system on all computers.  Everything else was decided to complete the next day. <br><br><h5>  Day 3 </h5><br>  The third day was D-day.  I would like to say a special thank you to the developers for the "Ubuntu Application Center", he made life easier for us.  First, with the help of it, we removed all unnecessary programs from the computer, and then installed the necessary ones for work.  After a couple of hours, it was possible to sigh with joy, knowing that we could and managed to do everything that we wanted. <br><br><h5>  Total </h5><br>  Almost 2 weeks have passed since the installation, the system works flawlessly, and there are almost no problems.  Of course, at the initial stage, it was not easy for students to use an unfamiliar system, but now, after a while, not all have become accustomed to a lot of time and few have difficulty in working.  Some people liked the system so much that they asked for a disk in order to install it on their home computer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/8c83bef2/30a2a6c7/3575b089/1f53eb96.png"><br><ul><li>  Security.  Antivirus is not required, you can safely use flash drives without fear of various autorun viruses. </li><li>  Speed.  The system boots and runs faster than Windows. </li><li>  All software in one place.  Convenient application center, with which you can quickly install new or remove unnecessary software. </li><li>  A lot of software.  When used in offices, various enterprises and schools allows you to save a lot of money on the purchase of proprietary software. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/ac11c811/33b14737/bec33e15/4d5f96f4.png"><br><ul><li>  Novelty.  It takes extra time for the children to learn the system and use it on a level with Windows. </li><li>  Difficult setting.  Sometimes requires significant doping </li></ul></habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/130091/">https://habr.com/ru/post/130091/</a></p>
