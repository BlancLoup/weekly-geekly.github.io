Life is in full swing.  In this case, the user is almost impersonal.  Everyone has a nickname, some have a name and, only a small part of the population, a photograph.  Karma is no longer a measure of some professionalism, good knowledge in a certain area.  There was an idea to organize a bookshelf on Habr√©. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Books </h4><br>  Books still provide much more fundamental knowledge than fragmentary articles and examples on the Internet.  At the same time, the paper is gradually replaced by the electronic component, but this direction does not lose relevance. <br><br>  In the company of Steve McConelle, the very first stage of becoming a professional developer is the reading of a number of classic books on software development philosophy. <br><br>  After reading the generally recognized professional literature, a person becomes a specialist, can communicate with colleagues in the same language, comes an understanding when it is possible and necessary to break the rules.

    <h4>  Reading and discussion </h4><br>  It is noticed that reading people have better and more structured knowledge.  It is to their opinion that it is necessary to listen.  Imagine a situation: a certain modern interface, its convenience, color design, simplicity are being discussed.  Different users express their opinions, but it‚Äôs quite difficult to determine which of them is right, you need to refer to additional sources. <br><br>  And now two ‚Äúspecialists‚Äù agree in the comments with absolutely opposite opinions about the location of the button, the window, etc. What should you listen to?  Who to believe?  Immediately and not tell.  But if we visited each house and saw their bookshelves (you can look at the e-book), it would immediately become clear that one interface specialist with experience, and the second is a severe assembler programmer who does not use libraries.  Then the opinion of the first opponent will be in priority.  Even if a person has read only one book by Alan Cooper, On the Interface, he has an advantage in discussion.  Of course, a ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù discussion is considered. <br><br><h4>  Concept </h4><br>  There was an idea: to organize a bookshelf on Habr√© for each user.  The resource can seriously increase the level of user knowledge, there will be a good reserve for sociality, it will be possible to choose high-quality literature. <br><br>  In the user profile, I propose to add a column ‚Äúbookshelf‚Äù, which will consist of two parts: ‚Äúread‚Äù and ‚ÄúI am going to read‚Äù.  Each book refers to a certain resource, say, the issuance of a search engine by name.  And there are a number of additional icons (as in the image below). <br><br>  The user logged in to someone in the profile.  Near each book there are two buttons: "read", "pick yourself."  If a user read a book, then it appears on his shelf.  If he liked it and was taken away, it appears in the section of books for perusal.  Here is how it all might look: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/fef95165/4aa86d64/853300b3/28fe9f71.png"><br><br>  Art education do not own, so do not judge strictly. <br><br>  The user logged into his profile.  It has buttons for adding, deleting, editing a book, as well as a ‚Äúread‚Äù button in front of all books set aside for reading. <br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br>  Habr's sociality will greatly increase, it will be possible to have more productive discussions, users will become less ‚Äúmeasured by karma‚Äù and unreasonably lower it.  If you go to the user profile, you see the specifics of the list of references, you understand what a person is interested in, the hand can only press a plus!  Remember, only in dispute truth is born! <br><br><h5>  Literature: </h5><br>  S.
