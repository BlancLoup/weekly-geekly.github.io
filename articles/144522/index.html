  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Buongiorno, 2GIS!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We are proud to announce that this day has come - 2GIS goes beyond the borders of the CIS and begins its journey further west!  To be more precise, Italy becomes the first foreign country, which was honored to receive a convenient combination of a city map and a directory of organizations in one.  The first cities of DuoGIS (as we are called in those parts) were Padua and Venice. <br><br>  For us, this is a very important historical milestone, because this is our first non-Russian project: the product comes out with an interface and rubricator in Italian.  But, truth, the translation into Russian and English is still planned.  It was necessary to refine the search algorithms - if earlier the search was carried out only in Russian, now 2GIS is ready for multilingualism. <br><br>  Like the other cities of 2GIS, Padua and Venice are available in the <a href="http://maps.2gis.it/">online version</a> , an <a href="http://venezia.2gis.it/ru/">offline program for the PC</a> , plus on-the-go applications for popular mobile platforms.

Cartographers 2GIS created 6,720 square kilometers of the map.  Map of Venice and Padua contains more than a million objects, more than 320,000 buildings.  The 2GIS directory contains up-to-date information on more than 24,000 organizations, and we continue to work on the collection and refinement of information. <br><br>  Of course, it was not without some nuances.  After working for 10 years impeccable technology to create a product in the territory of the Russian Federation, and constantly improving it, we are faced with the fact that not all of our templates fall on a foreign project.  In general, there were no problems with drawing a map: there were some difficulties with writing the names, but they were resolved within a few days.  But the collection of information for the directory turned out to be a less trivial task: as it turned out, it was not so easy to get through to any organization in Italy.  The local mentality (especially among residents living in tourist areas) is focused solely on ‚Äúlive communication‚Äù and there is practically no response to the phone there.  True, if you still managed to get through, the process of checking information was easy - the Italians are used to various kinds of polls, and besides, they like to chat a lot. <br><br>  Another aspect unusual for a Russian person is a siesta, an afternoon rest, the duration of which is not regulated by the state, not to mention the fact that it can be at almost any time of the day.  It happens that the working day of the Italians in the aggregate lasts only 4 hours!  For example, in the Russian Federation, a lunch break, as a rule, takes place from 13 to 14 hours.  In Italy, there is absolutely no standard: lunch can be at 12-16, 13-17, and it happened that 10-11.30 - working hours, 11.30-15.00 - break, 15.00-17.00 - again working time.  And this is not to mention the huge number of holidays and weekends. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4da/24a/725/4da24a7253e5468821b5858ae950c966.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>Three-dimensional map of Venice in 2GIS for PC</i> <br><br>  At times, it was also very difficult for our specialists to find the right address: in Venice and in the historical center of Padua, one building may have several rooms and be assigned to more than one street.  At the same time, many houses are very similar to each other, and there are no signs with an address on them!  There is also no logic in the numbering of buildings, sometimes different floors or entrances of one building may have a different address. <br><br>  It is all the more pleasant to realize that 2GIS with the map and reference book of Padua and Venice is ready, exists and works!  By the way, the online version of the map is made in a new design, which recently appeared in 2GIS for PC. <br><br>  All the usual functions remained in place, for example, you can right now <a href="http://go.2gis.ru/7z2q">follow the link</a> and see the famous Doge's Palace on the map: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9d9/d38/86f/9d9d3886f4300b68b70a1fc17e716a42.png" alt="image"><br><br>  And this place looks like in reality: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e0b/348/fe4/e0b348fe445c7fd533b9137fbb26d4cc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Just as in more than 150 cities of Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan, in the Italian version of 2GIS you can use information about public transport.  2GIS <a href="http://go.2gis.ru/4a1j">can tell</a> , for example, how to sail through the whole Grand Canal of Venice by river transport and get to the famous sandy islands of Lido. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/133/5f4/942/1335f4942650705af406ccb859d1f253.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Of course, the map information and directory of organizations is available in our completely free <a href="http://api.2gis.ru/">API</a> .  By the way, a new map appearance will soon appear in all cities of 2GIS Online. <br><br>  In conclusion, I would like to say that the development of 2GIS does not end there, but only begins.  In the future, we can expect a lot of new opportunities, cities, and even countries! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/144522/">https://habr.com/ru/post/144522/</a></p>
