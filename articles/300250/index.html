  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The new legislative initiative of the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation inserts sticks into the wheels of taxi services.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The Ministry of Transport has drafted amendments to the draft law ‚ÄúOn State Regulation of Passenger and Baggage Passenger Car Transportation in the Russian Federation‚Äù.  Amendments Ministry of Transport began to prepare in 2015.  To date, the ‚Äútoughest‚Äù version of the amendments has come out from under the authority of the agency, RBC sources believe. <br><br>  If the amendments are adopted in the current form, the online services will not be able to set tariffs for transportation without coordination with carriers.  The latter constantly complain that they cannot compete with their ‚Äúundervalued‚Äù prices of online services. <br><br>  Taxi service is not a monopolist, carriers have a choice whether to work with it at the set tariffs or not to work, says the source.  He does not understand the initiative of the Ministry of Transport.  The need to negotiate tariffs with carriers will affect "not in favor of customers," agrees an employee of the online transport aggregator.

      Transportation agents, including online aggregators, must carefully select contractors - taxi fleets and private owners, the Ministry of Transport said. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  He proposes that such services as <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AF%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581.%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8">Yandex.Taxi</a> , <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gett">Gett</a> , <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber">Uber</a> , check with them permission to carry passengers (and baggage) and documents on the right to business activities.  Until now, the legislation did not have these requirements. <br><br>  New requirements will lead to an increase in time and material costs on the part of taxi services. <br><br>  The amendments also introduce the responsibility of the aggregator to passengers for the quality of the service.  However, the interlocutors of RBC in several large online taxi aggregators remind that they are only intermediaries between passengers and carriers and cannot bear such responsibility.  Uber, Yandex.Taxi and Gett even have a special clause in an agreement with users. <br><br>  In addition to the above proposals, the Ministry of Transport is in favor of fixing the maximum number of permits for carriage issued in Russia.  If the number of applicants will be more, must be held auctions. <br><br>  The limit on the number of permits is a ‚Äúsensible idea,‚Äù says the general director of Eurotransservice and the chairman of the taxi committee of the Moscow Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Bogdan Konoshenko.  At the same time, he says that at the same time it is necessary to allow licenses to be sold, leased and inherited.  Such rules, for example, operate in New York.  This will help protect the market from unfair competition, says Konoshenko. <br><br>  Previously, the Kommersant publication <a href="http://www.kommersant.ru/Doc/2961915">reported</a> that the Federation of Russian Car Owners (PAR) on behalf of taxi drivers complained to Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev about FAS because the service refused to initiate cases regarding taxi services Uber, Gett and Yandex.Taxi.  It was noted that the PHA in July 2015 sent appeals to the FAS, the Prosecutor General‚Äôs Office and the Public Chamber with a request to check the activities of the aggregator companies operating in the market of taxi services for compliance with Russian legislation. <br><br>  First Deputy Chairman of the State Duma Committee on Constitutional Legislation and State Construction Vyacheslav Lysakov <a href="http://www.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/19/04/2016/5714b2d69a79470f63f5416c">told</a> RBC that it is necessary to distinguish between the responsibility of carriers and aggregators: ‚ÄúEveryone must be responsible for himself - the dispatch service through which the client orders a taxi guarantees that the driver will be transported with a license.  And the order driver is responsible for the safety and quality of services.  It would be strange if the dispatcher responded in case of an accident involving a taxi driver, ‚Äùhe argues. <br><br>  Lysakov is preparing his own version of the amendments.  He proposes to introduce into the bill the definition of "dispatch service", that is, to formulate a legislative definition of the business of online aggregators. <br><br>  On April 25, a conciliation meeting was appointed in the government on the draft amendments, which should be attended by representatives of the Ministry of Transport, the Ministry of Economic Development, the Ministry of Justice, the Moscow government and three of the largest online aggregators Yandex.Taxi, Gett, Uber, an interlocutor told a major taxi aggregators </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300250/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300250/</a></p>
