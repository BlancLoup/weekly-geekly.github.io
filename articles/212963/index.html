Different.  Lot.  <b>Caution traffic.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e4b/57f/7cc/e4b57f7ccf709d6dc85a9e91bea3096b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The difference between the use of private and public "clouds" often lies in the fact that the public is cheaper and easier to maintain, and the private is ‚Äúat hand‚Äù (which is often important for legal reasons).  For example, critical-level banking applications will almost certainly be placed in the private, and test environments can be deployed in the public. <a name="habracut"></a>

Now everything is much more interesting, complex tasks, even business processes have begun to outsource.  But everyone has different approaches.  For example, we came across a situation where ‚Äúto set up a LAN‚Äù meant ‚Äúto build walls in a building under construction, lay cable channels, push a cable and then configure the network‚Äù.  Therefore, one of the most important problems of the market is the lack of a clear regulatory framework, hence the strange technical specifications for tenders. <br><br>  *** <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7f5/15a/5a2/7f515a5a25450c56c43a05c3674bc4e3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In short - retail, insurance, banks and telecoms want to know more about you than Google.  To do this, they analyze hundreds of thousands of behavioral factors, identify common patterns and build their predictions.  We have already talked about a great example of what you should stop buying condoms in a supermarket, as in 10-12 months you will be sent a special offer with a discount on baby food. <br><br>  *** <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8c0/7c4/d7a/8c07c4d7a4dab8365212994249e805f3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Almost two centuries ago, when the mechanical clock was the pinnacle of technological thought of mankind, the Russian doctor Semyon Nikolaevich Korsakov made the first comparator - a machine that snapped the levers and could build a differential diagnosis.  Scientists criticized him, and the doctors did not receive the first mechanical computer that would allow him to diagnose the symptoms immediately.  As it turned out, the problem persists to this day - for example, one of the most frequent applications of BRMS is the formation of rules for issuing loans (to whom to give, who does not), processing insurance policies, and so on.  Very simply, BRMS is a repository of business rules, from which all other modules take information.  If it is necessary to ensure that the price for yogurt decreases by 10% a week before the expiration date, you can code a crutch - or you can add a rule to BRMS in 2 minutes.  IT departments are unloading - managers and salespeople can not go to them, but tune everything themselves. <br><br>  *** <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a30/9ef/200/a309ef200296099d2e3879dc7ab24850.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  You can build a profile of a client calling to the call center.  A primitive, but indicative situation is this: you call in support of the provider, you are met by the girl on the first line.  Before it immediately opens a window with data: ‚ÄúA regular customer, well versed in technology, Linux OS, usually calm and positive, 6 hits in the last year.  Note: does not like to reboot, said that uptime is 7 months.  Techworks on his site are not maintained. "  You say: "Hello, my channel is gone."  A girl instead of playing ‚Äúwhat kind of lights are on‚Äù and ‚Äúlet's reboot‚Äù immediately suggests: ‚ÄúDo you need to switch to a technical specialist?‚Äù.  Yes, you say. <br><br>  But if your sister calls, who does not understand anything, the dialogue will be different - here and ‚Äúwhat color is your internet‚Äù, and ‚Äúturn on and off‚Äù.  Well, even a smart call center knows when to call the good old customer and make a special offer, how careful operators are to customers, how to properly and quickly distribute the working time of operators, even if there are hundreds or even thousands, plus many other things. <br><br>  *** <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/405/84e/c28/40584ec28f0bdab736ddb6b063a988ac.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The usual leadership style in Russia is a daily inspection of their areas of responsibility and checking the status of each project.  It takes up to 60% of the work time - simply because the ‚Äúkeeper‚Äù may not say right away, but wait until the problem grows. <br><br>  BPM helps to find problems at the time of the first failure of the schedule, immediately draws attention to them and clearly says what is the name of the problem.  Relatively speaking, in the morning you check the project indicators - and if there are no yellow and red ‚Äútraffic lights‚Äù, you simply do your usual business, knowing that everything is under control. <br><br>  *** <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6ee/11c/523/6ee11c5237f81a01625b8ee086d178c1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Aviadvigatel OJSC, as the name implies, makes flying pieces, the schemes of which it is better not to carry over the territory.  One of the problems was that half of the employees were walking with smartphones, and then there was a post office, a camera and much more.  In general, there are two options - either to select phones at the entrance and not to give anything corporate to them, or to introduce a mobile device management system.  For example, a blocking camera on the site or allowing you to remotely erase all corporate information in case of loss of a smartphone.  Since we still have the XXI century, we chose an IT solution. <br><br>  *** <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/564/4fb/725/5644fb725c3a8f8c2c705da41b89c0f0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There are two big things.  The first is the solution of the traveling salesman problem for 500 cars, 1,500 couriers and many other people.  The second is to control what drivers are doing.  You can remove a lot of information from the machine - the position, the level of gasoline in the tank in real time, how many times the bucket was lifted from the excavator and when, where exactly the dump truck was unloading.  That is why we often faced riots of drivers against such implementations - in fact, the IT system deprived them of half of the earnings earned by the ‚Äúleftists‚Äù. <br><br>  *** <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/41e/9e1/b25/41e9e1b2545486b2a9f9edc32c5718dd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Everything is simple here.  There are more communication channels, and in order not to lose information from one of them, it is important to combine them.  In addition, it significantly speeds up business processes - interactions are carried out in one, the most convenient place.  And, finally, UC helps to really save, for example, on calls to an employee from a remote branch office, not by long distance, but by corporate network. <br><br>  There are things that are simply not efficiently discussed by mail or phone.  Because it is important to convey not only intonation, but also gestures.  For example, negotiations with new partners.  Or if the management needs to bring some decisions to the subordinates.  At the same time, driving or gathering in one place is long and expensive, so companies are deploying their videoconferencing solutions.  There are three important aspects - the traffic is protected, mobile devices are supported, plus there are software and hardware systems for organizing video presence in the conversations. <br><br>  *** <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/26a/490/749/26a490749169b4d9bcca05c7c9b54821.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In addition to protection against hackers, it is now important to protect against minor fraudsters.  For example, in banks it is important to track atypical transactions, both among client and employee actions, in order to prevent theft, for example, from stale client bank cards. <br><br><h4>  Interesting? </h4><br>  About each of these topics you can find several detailed topics in our <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/croc/">corporate blog on Habr√©</a> .  Subscribe, we will continue to talk about big implementations, complex large-scale software, the world of big business, millions of pieces of hardware that fit in one standard unit, and other things that are found in far from every sysadmin. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/212963/">https://habr.com/ru/post/212963/</a></p>
