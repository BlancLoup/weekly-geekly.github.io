      Our project is a self-educational resource on the program Photoshop.  We write and translate lessons, answer questions.  Photoshop is more of a working tool for us: one of us works as a designer, someone takes pictures, someone needs it for entertainment or just to create a funny avatar. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe World of Photoshop‚Äù began its existence in the 2000th year, then still on a free hosting on the People.  For a long time it did not develop;  only 6 years later, in the 2006th year, there was a slight rebirth.  Then I wrote my PHP engine and moved the site to paid hosting with a new domain.  Since then, new materials began to appear - at first I wrote new lessons myself.  We now have almost 200 publications, but this is only the beginning.  Let it not be fast, but we are developing and we are planning to make this site more meaningful and useful than now.  The goal was always the same - to write about what is relevant. <br><br>  The first engine, as I already noted, was written by me on a bunch of php + mysql without using any ready-made libraries or frameworks (then I didn‚Äôt even know such words).  Now still from the finished - only JsHttpRequest.  During the entire existence of the project, the engine corresponded 2 times (in 2007 and 2009), and at one time more than one freelancer put his hand to it.  In recent months, the conditional caching of lesson pages, the formation of sitemap.xml, ‚Äúlicked out‚Äù the correct issuance of error codes (301, 304, 401, 403, 404, 500) have been implemented from technical chips.  As a logical conclusion to all of this, our site is now the nominee of the WebHiTech contest.  Also, the statistics states that after the listed innovations, the traffic from the search increased slightly (the statistics on the site is publicly available). <br><br>  In the near future, we plan to start actively filling the section with files, plus we will finalize the section itself - we will probably do something in the blog format.  And, unlike other sites, we do not plan to upload files to free file hosting, maybe even buy another server with a sharpening wide channel, if things go uphill.  Good news for our project, I think, is still to come!  On behalf of the whole team, I thank Truevds.ru for supporting our project in the form of a grant - this gives a tangible financial scope for the development of our business.  <strike>P.</strike> $.  We are looking for authors and translators. <br><br>  <a href="http://nu-44.ru/">Novouralsk online community</a> <br>  Zhuravlev <br><br>  Novouralsk is located approximately in the middle between Yekaterinburg and Nizhny Tagil, it is included in the Closed Administrative Territorial Unity of Ukraine (closed administration. Territory education).  Previously, the city was called Sverdlovsk-44.  Hence the domain of the project NU-44.ru. <br><br>  The project was created in 2003. It was placed first by city providers, then by acquaintance.  Initially, LDU (Land Down Under) was used as a CMS, then there was a transition to the Seditio branch (http://www.neocrome.net/).  But I stopped at the LDU, then finished writing it.  Then the site‚Äôs brakes started (the base of the forum grew, the page could open in 30 seconds (there were no time limits for php, the site began to hang other projects that were on this machine), and besides, I wanted to redesign or rebrand. <br><br>  In 2009, it was decided to switch to LiveStreet while retaining the user base and use commercial shared hosting.  Due to the fact that LiveStreet is very picky about resources, several hosters had to be changed, as they began to receive formidable load warnings with parallel blocking of the account.  And in September 2009, I left for TrueVDS, immediately taking True20.  With VDS - I ran into it for the first time, automatic installation of presets saved, was very lacking and lacked a web panel.  Then he switched to <br>  Preset "Optimized".  But LiveStreet continued to eat resources.  Everything possible was optimized (caching and accelerator were included in the ‚ÄúOptimized‚Äù preset).  A specialist Linux system administrator was connected.  But there was no result.  About 400-500 users did their job.  Quite regularly on the site could be found error 502 or 504, which could not help but annoy :) <br><br>  Somewhere in May, we go back to the forums - the blog engine did not take root, the people gradually left the resource, other resources began to be created, and the rewritten forums were already ready.  I understood why the old forums slowed down, clearly saw the advantages of having / not indexing and complex page caching was added (caching at the level of database queries, complex and heavy queries are calculated and put into files).  The new forum began to work faster than the old and the blogs on the left, but this did not help to completely get away from 502 - 504 errors.  And here participation in the competition in October of this year.  Having mobilized people, arranging the asechno-banner campaign, we occupy the second place, go to the True22 tariff.  The miracle finally happened :) - the page loads about 0.3 seconds (without caching), with caching even less. <br><br>  Website - I try not to load banners, at the moment there are none at all.  Social advertising for any forumchanin is free.  Now there is an action: to congratulate a friend, a company with an anniversary - also for free - the main thing is for a friend / company to be from the city.  Many Novouralians consider NU-44 to be their home on the net. <br><br>  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/vkopenmp/">Vomp</a> <br>  Timofey, <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/yamalight/" class="user_link">yamalight</a> , <a href="http://codezen.ru/">codezen.ru</a> <br><br>  VOMP was originally developed as a completely simple utility for searching and viewing videos from the Vkontatke.ru database.  Later, at the request of a still small audience, additional functions began to be added, such as searching the database of existing films (here is a special thank you for the base for the guys from the Cinema Base), the ability to download videos, etc. <br>  Initially, VOMP was decoded as Vkontakte Open Media Player, but based on what was planned for the future, the project will probably become just VOMP.  Despite the fact that at the moment this project has the role of a fan project for us, we are doing it quite closely and we hope to develop it further as far as possible.  Now the project has more than a thousand regular users and this number, albeit slowly, but constantly growing.  In the near future, we are going to publish several technical articles (and maybe something on design too, but I cannot say for sure) related to the development of the application and some of the difficulties we encountered and their solutions. <br>  Also in the plans for the near future: <br>  1) A new, super cool design that we have already shown on our our Twitter! <br>  2) Versions for the two most popular mobile platforms - Android and iOS.  And not only for mobile phones, but also for tablets! <br>  3) Improved version of the download manager with support for torrents <br>  4) Full integration with the movie base service (including the future paid version with a bunch of very tasty chips) <br><br>  Well, and all sorts of things on the little things.  We hope that you will stay with us, because any opinion is important to us!  And most importantly, if you have any ideas about the features - be sure to let us know and we will certainly add them.  :) <br><br><br><br>  PS Some people have the impression that grants are provided only to TrueVDS customers.  This is not true.  Grants are available to everyone without restriction.  The main condition is that it should be a popular, useful and interesting project.  <a href="">Apply</a> , welcome! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/107963/">https://habr.com/ru/post/107963/</a></p>
