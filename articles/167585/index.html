      In short, Acumatica is the leading developer of a cloud ERP platform for small and medium businesses.  And if in more detail, the company has 2 main areas: <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Acumatica ERP</b> - our own cloud-based products for financial management, distribution, etc., which can be purchased with our partner‚Äôs add-on modules (ISV) <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>OEM</b> - providing Acumatica technologies to partners who, based on them, create and sell their products under their own brand <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The company's history began back in 2007, when Mikhail Shchelkonogov, a graduate of the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology with 15 years of experience in the ERP industry (and our CTO and co-founder in combination) developed together with colleagues a radically new platform for cloud applications that could easily open in the browser, even on mobile.  The uniqueness of the development lies in the fact that it was the first cloud-based ERP product designed for small and medium-sized businesses, allowing the client to choose the most suitable installation option - on the client‚Äôs server (on-premise), on a virtual / dedicated server or in the cloud.  Moreover, the client was able to easily migrate from one option to another without losing data. <br><br>  And everything would be fine, but at that time, Mikhail was an employee of Parallels, and his development absolutely did not fit into the concept of development of the employer, and Mikhail did not want to abandon his brainchild and ‚Äú <a href="http://www.forbes.ru/svoi-biznes-column/master-klass/88696-kak-postupat-s-neugomonnymi-innovatorami-destabiliziruyushchim">do business</a> ‚Äù.  As a result, there was an ambiguous situation when an employee of the company didn‚Äôt want to give up his favorite undertaking to anybody, even under the threat of dismissal or a salary increase.  Fortunately, Sergey Belousov, the founder and CEO, realized that he could not convince a stubborn employee, and decided that then it would be better to help him create a new company.  Belousov became the co-founder of Acumatica, to which Mikhail left to create his product, and attracted John Howell to its creation: <br><br><blockquote>  - This is a special story that does not fit into the general framework.  The Acumatica project separated as an independent business from the Parallels company.  One of the divisions of Parallels is responsible for developing business applications for service providers.  Since the founding of the company, a very active subgroup headed by Mikhail Shchelkonogov worked in it, trying to develop a new technology that was not suitable for Parallels.  Acumatica technology is based on the Microsoft platform (Windows, .NET, SQLServer, etc.).  Parallels main customers are service providers, such as hosters.  Few of them work with the Microsoft platform, so we need programs that run on both Windows and Linux, Unix.  Acumatica works only on Microsoft technologies.  All attempts to force this team to stop development, which are not of great value to Parallels, were not crowned with success, and I had no choice but to liquidate the union of activists.  But in the process of explanatory work, it became clear that Michael was stubborn, like all innovators, and still continue to improve the technology, which by that time was already quite developed.  Then I invited as an expert, John Howell, one of the founders of Solomon Software, the former pioneer in the field of ERP-systems.  In Solomon Software, John Howell led marketing and was responsible for commercial policy.  He found the technology very promising and expressed willingness to participate in the startup with both time and money.  Then I decided to invest in the project. </blockquote><br>  Mikhail created a very advanced technology, but on its basis it was necessary to create concrete proposals, to focus on a certain type of consumer, that is, to create a working business model. <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/084/1a5/490/0841a5490b29f36eab4b271d5f24bd6a.jpg"><br><br>  <i>The developed platform was shown to the co-founder of Solomon Software and one of the best ERP specialists, John Howell.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Thanks to John, Solomon Software became the largest privately owned ERP company in the United States, in 2000 Solomon Software merged with Great Plains and was acquired by Microsoft.</i>  <i>John became a member of the board of directors and spends 2 days a week on marketing, developing a sales strategy for Acumatica.</i>  <i>A little later, we managed to find the third ‚Äúpiece‚Äù - the head for operational management, they became the first CEO of the company, Isakiel Steiner</i> . <br><br><br><br>  And although all the events described occurred in 2008, the first sales of Acumatica started only in 2010, that is, two years later.  The specifics of the ERP market is such that it was impossible to immediately come to him with a raw product and offer customers a solution that meets 5% of their requirements.  Therefore, for several years, our colleagues have spent on developing and creating from scratch those solutions that are now being successfully sold, mainly in the USA and Southeast Asia.  If we talk about numbers, Acumatica today is: <br>  ‚Ä¢ The only cloud ERP platform designed for small and medium businesses. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Hundreds of installations and tens of thousands of users - among our customers there are such famous brands as Pizza Hut and KFC <br>  ‚Ä¢ Over 140 partners - the company over the past two years has been actively expanding its sales network and opened offices in Indonesia, Mexico, and Singapore <br>  ‚Ä¢ 50+ attracted ISVs - for them, Acumatica is the platform through which they create the final product, adapting it to the specific needs of customers <br>  ‚Ä¢ A company with great business prospects - the global ERP market for medium-sized businesses today is about $ 11 billion <br>  ‚Ä¢ Two offices - R &amp; D in Moscow and recently relocated from Virginia to Seattle headquarters responsible for marketing and sales <br>  ‚Ä¢ 70 employees - all this is done by people from Microsoft, Parallels, SKB Kontur and BP, who now work at Acumatica <br>  ‚Ä¢ A strong team of investors - including Almaz Capital and Visma (the leader in the Scandinavian ERP market) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/268/fdf/c11/268fdfc11ffd4ca18d8d985427a4c50a.png"><br>  <i>American office Acumatica</i> <br>  In the following posts, we will happily and in detail describe how we managed to achieve all this.  After all, the main purpose of our blog, as it is banal, does not sound - to share experience, get feedback and look for the best developers to your team. <br>  The announcement of the following posts: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Distract from technology, clouds and ERP.  Let us give the floor to our HR, who would like to pour out the soul about the mistakes being made by the candidates at the interview.  We see that the topic of HR and interview discussions is quite popular, but everyone gives a rating from the applicant. <br>  ‚Ä¢ We will talk about how we manage to ‚Äúsurvive‚Äù on the highly competitive ERP market.  Is it always necessary to compete with others or can a win-win situation be achieved without losses? <br>  ‚Ä¢ Your choice.  Tell us that it would be interesting for you to see from us in the nearest posts, and we will be happy to tell about it!  From the brand of our coffee machine to the features of working with Windows Azure. <br><br>  PS <a href="https://twitter.com/ru_Acumatica">Follow</a> us on Twitter ( <a href="https://twitter.com/ru_Acumatica">@ru_Acumatica</a> ), write your comments - well, help us kill the rest of the day. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/167585/">https://habr.com/ru/post/167585/</a></p>
