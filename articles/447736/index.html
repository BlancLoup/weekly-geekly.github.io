Since then, sales have increased and continue to grow rapidly.  According to our data, the total sales of drones in Russia amounted to 160 thousand units for 2018.  At the end of the year, this figure increased by 70% in units and by 53% in money (1.9 billion rubles). <br><br>  The results are quite impressive against the background of the average growth rates of other categories of electronics in the Russian market.  Let's try to understand what caused such a strong interest in UAV buyers and what problems they may have when using drones. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  What do the numbers say? </h1><br>  Let's compare the sales of drones in different price categories in 2017 and 2018.  With a general positive trend in money and money, the demand for cheap devices is growing faster than premium ones.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fr/xm/rh/frxmrhcrbjpxzwqn9dnpvyzj228.png"><br><br>  This trend can be explained simply: drones in expensive price segments are a purely niche product for gadzhetomans and pros. <br><br>  But the drones of the lower price category - the product is massive, the demand for it spurs and sales of more expensive models.  After all, having bought a cheap drone, the user will quickly face all the restrictions.  And if he wants to be improved in shooting from the quadcopter, more expensive device will be required.  As they say, the appetite comes with eating! <br><br>  Many readers will wonder why it is to improve in the shooting of the video?  We explain. <br><br><h1>  Why do you need a drone? </h1><br>  Most people (of course, not on Habr√©) at the mention of the "drone" immediately appears the image of a reconnaissance or assault drone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e64/8af/7b3/e648af7b3fde1e9290af069df2d7fe1a.jpg"><br><br>  But for UAVs there are many uses in peaceful life.  One of the most popular is photo and video. <br><br>  Fifteen years ago, shooting, for example, a mass event or bird flight view required renting a helicopter and installing expensive and sophisticated equipment that stabilized a video camera in flight.  But with the advent of drones, the situation has changed dramatically.  Videographers received a versatile and flexible tool for shooting.  A stabilized video camera on a gyroscopic suspension and a complex of control electronics allow you to ‚Äútie‚Äù the camera to the subject.  It does not matter at all how the position of the UAV itself changes in space (up to certain limits, of course), its electronics will precisely hold the lens in the correct position for the operator, tracking the object being shot. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a46/4c1/96f/a464c196fd3c132ac248c6d5d4916845.jpg"><br><br>  In November 2015, at a <a href="http://www.thg.ru/technews/20151113_135839.html">press conference</a> devoted to the release of the quadrocopter DJI Phantom 3, company representatives said that most of the directors and cameramen, and the audience too, had long been ‚Äútired‚Äù of standard shooting angles.  After all, if you look closely at many movies and news programs, you can clearly see that almost everywhere a standard set of angles is used, limited by the capabilities of regular stationary or robotic video cameras.  A UAV, equipped with high-quality Full HD or 4K-camera, give a truly unlimited opportunities for photo and video. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1b1/058/de0/1b1058de0b32ae78fe13ac11cdc0a7c9.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0a1/7a8/e53/0a17a8e538969458cbacce8a51f3259e.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, if we look at the data on sales volumes in pieces, then about 70% are accounted for by devices with HD and SD cameras.  While Full-HD and 4K-drones occupy about 15% of the market. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/r2/6d/yo/r26dyokd1irny3spmulm1ikx0pa.png"><br><br>  At the same time, in 2018, sales of ‚Äúbasic‚Äù SD devices increased 3.5 times in units by 3.5 times, and 4K drones, by 2 times.  The presence of the camera is definitely a sales driver. <br><br>  Drones equipped with Full HD-cameras, occupy the smallest share, because shooting Full HD-video is not the most promising.  Against the background of video clips shot in 4K on social networks, the Full HD video sequence gradually loses its charm. <br><br><h1>  About other features </h1><br>  Video capture is, of course, the most popular feature of drones.  But today, users are increasingly paying attention to related features. <br><br>  Of course, the main ones are the stabilization of the video camera and the number of axes of stabilization.  In low-cost entry-level UAVs this is not the strongest side: most often there is simply no stabilization.  And to get the picture without tremor, the technology of electronic image stabilization is used, with which you will not be able to make master videos.  But even simple drones will plunge into the fascinating world of video, shot from the air, and enjoy a unique film made from unusual angles. <br><br>  In more advanced models, in addition to the stabilization system, proprietary technologies are also used, allowing, for example, the drone to monitor the subject.  You can put in your memory, for example, your face, and the camera will track its movement (the function of pursuit).  This mode is useful when shooting trips, holidays, sporting events. <br><br>  Possibilities of the UAV extend also such functions as fixing and laying of a flight course.  As a rule, this uses the built-in GPS-receiver.  Depending on the complexity and price of the model, such systems also differ in positioning accuracy and other possibilities.  For example, if you watched all the series of the film ‚ÄúBack to the Future‚Äù, you probably remember how in one of them the dog was walking with a flying collar.  So, with the help of a modern UAV, it is not a problem to make such an ‚Äúelectronic nurse‚Äù for dog walking.  Ask the drone the trajectory of the walk, put the photos of your dog in memory, connect the drone with the collar, and your personal robot for walking the dog is ready.  Of course, this option is only suitable for very small breeds, but it is quite working and fully feasible. <br><br>  And what if there are several drones flying in the air nearby, for example?  Now, of course, this situation is rare, but in the future it can easily become commonplace.  Or how during your first flights to avoid a collision of your device, say, with a tree, a pillar, a wall of a house?  In such cases, collision avoidance technology will help out.  Most reputable manufacturers such as DJI, SPL, Mioshi, SYMA and others have already included this feature in the arsenal of their drones a long time ago. <br><br><h1>  About drone flights in Russia </h1><br>  A few years ago, the flights of drones in our country were practically not regulated at all.  There was a law according to which only very heavy UAVs were subject to registration.  But now the situation has changed a lot. <br><br>  Rules for the use of drones are defined by the Law on UAV, which is developed on the basis of the FZ-60, and in July 2017 came into force.  According to this document, all UAVs are divided into two categories: weighing up to and over 0.25 kg. <br><br>  Owners of UAVs weighing up to 0.25 kg can do without registration.  But if your device is heavier, then it must be registered.  For this you have to collect an impressive package of documents.  Such measures are due to an attempt to prevent possible terrorist acts, invasion of privacy and violations of the boundaries of private property. <br><br>  Note that, according to the law, it is strictly forbidden to use quadrocopters in the zones of strategic and military facilities that are of fundamental importance for the state.  These include the lands of reserves.  It is also forbidden to fly over private territories under protection, and manufacturing enterprises.  Plus, the law does not recommend raising the drone to a height of more than 50 meters, so that there is no collision with other aircraft. <br><br>  In general, at the moment the situation around the video from drones in Russia is furnished with a large set of bureaucratic procedures.  And just so you can take pictures only at your summer cottage, and even then flying over him, like a chipmunk in a well-known joke - ‚Äúlow-low‚Äù - and provided that your neighbors do not see it.  Otherwise, they may complain to the police for invading their privacy.  Well, or go to the wilderness, where people are generally rare, and there already take away the soul, removing the beauty of wildlife. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/629/e69/09d/629e6909de1d0504efa1f9fc79b2eec1.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d23/1f4/45f/d231f445f2b93d349f1ca364cf59d87f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cab/767/30d/cab76730daeb9a8e9e36f2d9ee89a9e1.jpg"><br><br><h1>  And what about other countries? </h1><br>  If you are going to take a drone with you on a trip to shoot a film from unusual angles, in addition to local customs and maps of the route, study the local laws governing the use of UAVs.  They can be very different from ours, and in both directions. <br><br>  More information about the laws governing the flight of drones in different countries can be found on various specialized sites. <br><br>  <b>USA</b> <br>  In the US, there is a law on mandatory registration of drones.  But there is no need to carry the documents to the registering authority.  The whole procedure is performed at the time of purchase of the UAV in the online store.  If the drone was not registered at the time of purchase, the offender faces a serious fine of $ 27,000 (data at the time of writing).  After paying 5 dollars of state duty and a couple of days of waiting, you get the appropriate document. <br><br>  All questions about the use of UAVs at the federal level are decided by the Federal Aviation Administration.  Federal laws prohibit drones from rising above 122 meters, flying closer than 5 miles from airports, and taking to the air above certain national parks. <br><br>  The weight of the drone can not exceed 25 kg.  In addition, it must be remembered that each state has its own rules and rules of flight, so you should carefully consider not only the requirements of the federal, but also local authorities. <br><br>  <b>Canada</b> <br>  Rules for the use of drones in Canada can be called one of the most liberal.  They are very simple and straightforward. <br><br>  If you are not a businessman and a scientist, and your device is lighter than 35 kg (drones are lighter than 250 grams are not considered to be drones, they are considered as toys), if you follow safety rules and your drone‚Äôs flight does not carry any threats to anyone, then you don‚Äôt is needed.  All regulations in force in Canada are available on the Canadian Department of Transportation website.  But, unfortunately, in this country the laws will soon be tightened. <br><br>  <b>Italy</b> <br>  This is one of the most popular countries for Russian tourists.  But remember that in Italy, UAVs are forbidden to fly over large concentrations of people, over cities, and also near strategic objects: railway stations, airports, power plants, military bases, government buildings.  And the most stringent rules limiting the use of drones, operate in Rome.  It is forbidden to fly up on a drone closer to people and private property closer than 50 meters, as well as shoot within a radius of less than eight kilometers from airports. <br><br>  Pleases at least the fact that all these restrictions apply only to private shooting.  Commercial video is deprived of many of them, however, you need to get a license for it. <br><br>  Very similar legislation applies in neighboring France, as well as in Germany. <br><br>  <b>Great Britain</b> <br>  On the "foggy" island legislation on the use of drones is very similar to the Russian.  Here, without registration, you can only use devices weighing up to 250 grams.  Heavier devices are subject to mandatory registration. <br><br>  It is natural for pilots, controllers, to know the rules of safe piloting.  It is separately stated that in the UK it is allowed to use only those drones that comply with British law (in terms of safety). <br><br>  Separately prescribed restrictions for UAVs equipped with a camera and camcorder.  They are forbidden to approach a person, car, building or other structure less than 50 m. Non-commercial drones are forbidden to fly over large groups of people, including entertainment and sporting events (the car must be located not less than 150 m from such facilities). <br><br>  Owners of commercial drones must obtain a license from the country's civil aviation authority.  Plus, the British authorities are now trying to legislatively introduce a provision on programmatically prohibiting the flight of UAVs over certain areas of the country. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f9/89b/48e/4f989b48e97067e3f9ca0279c0542316.jpg"><br><br><h1>  Instead of conclusion </h1><br>  In most countries, you can fly without permission only on light 250-gram toys, and even then with all sorts of restrictions.  The right to privacy is protected very strictly everywhere, so carefully study the rules for using drones before using them. <br><br>  Successful to you flights and excellent shots! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/447736/">https://habr.com/ru/post/447736/</a></p>
