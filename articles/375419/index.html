Shock, panic!  But the electric car miracle does not die, and since our publication is heavily involved in the automotive industry, let me explain what the current state of affairs of this super popular company really means. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Tesla does not depend on oil prices </h5><br>  According to the Energy Information Administration report, the cost of a barrel of American crude oil fell by 42 percent from June 2014. But oil has nothing to do with Tesla's earnings. <br><br>  Tesla collects high-speed luxury cars that cost no less than $ 71,000.  With additional options, the price for the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mailru/blog/228585/">Model S is</a> close to a hundred thousand, and in foreign markets even more (for example, in Norway, where the company sends parts of cars from which it collects cars on the spot to avoid high import duties).  Model S customers are not particularly worried about oil prices, and they have at least one more luxury petrol engine.

      Unlike Nissan Leaf and other compact inexpensive cars, Model S is both a whim and a show off.  This was the case with the Tesla Roadster and this will be the case for the Model X. Tesla car purchases are based on emotions and fashion, not on the real value of things and not on the passionate desire to save on fuel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1a4/300/a81/1a4300a81ce34fd69c6f744879ba1c68.png"><br><br><h5>  Tesla is not considered primarily a car company. </h5><br>  From the point of view of investors, Tesla is closer to Twitter than the same Toyota.  Tesla was born in Silicon Valley, and until now, the market assesses it.  The three-digit value of the stock almost guarantees price hikes, and analysts readily confirm that the price is based mainly on what Tesla promises to do in the future, and not on what it is doing now. <br><br>  Co-founder and CEO, Elon Musk, owns about 25% of the company, and began it almost entirely at his own expense.  He will not let her die.  Fashionable product, lack of competitors, and the dynamic leader of the company - all this helps Tesla keep afloat, until it starts to produce hundreds of thousands of cars a year. <br><br><h5>  Tesla is overvalued </h5><br>  Since entering the stock exchange in July 2010, Tesla shares have risen in price by 930%.  Their total cost is almost twice as high as Fiat-Chrysler and almost falls to half the cost of General Motors.  And this is a manufacturing company that does not report the figures for monthly sales, hides the volume of work in progress, owns its dealers, invests an unusually high percentage of profit in loan programs, and had a profit during just one quarter.  Tesla shares plummeted below $ 180 in May, after a rather mediocre first quarter, but then quickly rose and left it behind. <br><br>  Analysts, such as Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley, with each of the following report, all raised and raised the value of the company's shares, telling, for example, in the February report, how Tesla will become the leader of an autonomous "utopian society."  Thanks to such positive reviews, and to Mask himself, whose tweet collects more attention than if Fiat-Chrysler had forced all Wall Street with its Ferrari and Challengers, this strategy works.  Until. <br><br><h5>  Tesla remains a tasty morsel </h5><br>  Everyone with the 401 (k) savings pension plan in the USA knows that the market can make sharp and unpleasant leaps.  Tesla investors know this, are used to it, and they don‚Äôt care.  There was a justified correction.  Tesla should not cost so much, judging by their profit reports.  But customers love Tesla.  Their <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/201128/">future battery factory</a> received huge tax rebates from the state of Nevada, and Panasonic has seriously invested in it.  Sales grow and spread throughout the world.  As long as investors do not make sudden movements, successful growth will continue, at least until the middle of the year, if Elon and his friends can present the promised sports sedan Model 3 and the already <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/241042/">decently delayed Model X crossover</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/375419/">https://habr.com/ru/post/375419/</a></p>
