During the reading, it suddenly became aware that the article was a guide to organizing and working with the customer community on the Internet and social networks!  I decided to replace the corresponding words (‚Äúkitten‚Äù by ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù, ‚Äúfamily‚Äù by ‚Äúcompany‚Äù, etc.) and received material useful both for smm-specialists and marketers, and for ordinary fur seal lovers.  So let's go! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b><u>Why not start a community:</u></b> <br><br>  <b>1. Allergies to customers or just dislike.</b>

      Is it worth starting a community if you or your company's employees are allergic to customers or simply do not like them?  This is a very serious question.  It is often asked by employees of not very customer-oriented organizations (for example, state-owned), but who dream of acquiring a community and being ‚Äúin trend.‚Äù  Of course, if the company does not like customers, and customers - the company, start a community is not worth it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/54a/4a1/76d/54a4a176da07bd8f77c4dcae1953685f.png"><br><br>  <b>2. Community - a temporary hobby of some employees of the company.</b> <br><br>  Remember, a community can live as much time as your brand will live.  All these years you will be responsible for the life and health of the community.  Therefore, it is necessary to think well, weigh the pros and cons and approach the institution of the community with the utmost responsibility. <br><br>  <b>3. It is not possible to regularly feed the community with quality content.</b> <br><br>  Undoubtedly, you need to give the community only high-quality content, and not order it from unknown cheap copywriters.  Due to poor nutrition, the community can get sick, destructors (brand prosecutors) can appear in it, which can simply destroy the community. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c98/7a1/753/c987a175399bda8fcda7c7bcaef3775e.jpg"><br><br>  <b>4. Do you think that the community is easy to care for and it is very cool!</b> <br><br>  Starting a community is easy, harder to care for.  And this is not only promotions and answers to questions.  Monthly and annual analytics of the growth of the community, inspection of engagement, care for brand advocates are also needed.  A healthy community should be active and well maintained. <br><br>  <b>5. You believe that the community does not take much time.</b> <br><br>  Do not forget that the community needs constant attention.  At first, try to play with clients more often, hold promotions and contests, and win their trust.  Short-term methods of increasing loyalty work in the long term, if you regularly engage with them. <br><br>  Often, companies start a community just because it is fashionable, because "another company has a community, and it is so cool."  And they start, without even thinking about how they will take care of him, such as ‚Äúlet the community come here, we will understand later!‚Äù.  But you'd better decide, as they say, on the shore.  What if it's not your story at all? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/140722/">https://habr.com/ru/post/140722/</a></p>
