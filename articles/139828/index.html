We decided to create our corporate blog on Habr√© to keep you informed about our news and provide a more convenient way to follow the development of the system for all users. <br><br>  As before, ImageCMS continues to develop primarily as a free OpenSource project, we are interested in a large number of partners and active users who would develop it together with our team. <br><br>  ImageCMS is constantly developing and improving, new releases are regularly released, which increase the convenience and speed of the system.  In order to make the system even more interesting for developers, a store of modules, templates and plug-ins will appear, in which our partners will be able to offer their designs.  We believe that this will be a serious step towards the development of our system. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For those who are not familiar with ImageCMS, here are some screenshots and links to the demo version of the system.

From the moment of its appearance, the project has grown into an independent direction of our activity.  Today, it allows you to create online stores of the highest level of complexity. <br><br>  The fact that the number of users is growing inspires us to further work on the development of our product.  It must meet the demands of the time, be friendly, easy to use and quick to set up.  Therefore, we want to present you the latest innovations of version 2.9.0, as well as future expected v3.0, which are left to wait for very short time. <br><br>  We understand that the main requirements that face the engine for an online store are: <br><ol><li>  convenient management of goods and orders; </li><li>  customer management; </li><li>  usability of the client part. </li></ol><br>  Today ImageCMS successfully copes with such requirements.  Order management is conveniently thought through using the admin panel, you can sort orders, search, view users.  The client part is also functional and convenient, tested on a variety of projects both by us personally and by partners. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1b0/14d/628/1b014d628095df27aa850230b6ab5dc7.jpg"><br>  <a href="http://www.imagecms.net/image_cms_shop">Access to the demo site ImageCMS Shop</a> <br><br>  Below is a list of innovations of the latest version of ImageCMS 2.9.0: <br><ul><li>  There was a synchronization with Yandex.market. </li><li>  Added the ability to attach pictures to product options. <br>  Ability to create and edit order statuses. <br>  Now it is possible to view the users of the online store, their wish-lists of the user, requests for appearance, call-back, order history, as well as contact information: name, login (phone), Address, City, City Index, E-mail, amount completed orders, registration time. </li><li>  In the update, it became possible to create wish-lists, call-back, requests for notification, ‚Äúin stock‚Äù marks.  We led orders to the form of a table with the fields: ‚ÄúOrder No.‚Äù, ‚ÄúLogin‚Äù, ‚ÄúFull Name‚Äù, ‚ÄúOrder Amount‚Äù, ‚ÄúDate and Time of Order‚Äù, ‚ÄúPayment Method‚Äù, ‚ÄúDelivery Method‚Äù, ‚ÄúStatus‚Äù, ‚ÄúButton view ‚Äù,‚Äú delete button ‚Äù. </li><li>  The ability to search for orders by number, by status, by date, by login, as well as the ability to change the status of the user has been created. </li><li>  The following settings have been added to the ‚Äúsystem-settings‚Äù: <br><ul><li>  on the image tab - the size for the small image / additional images / watermark; </li><li>  on the ‚Äúorders‚Äù tab - notifications about status changes; </li><li>  wish-lists tab; </li><li>  tab "notification of appearance"; </li><li>  tab "call-back"; </li><li>  tab "Registration" after ordering; </li><li>  tab "Password Recovery by E-mail". </li></ul></li></ul><br><h2>  Work does not stop, we are already actively working on a new release 3.0. </h2><br>  Focusing on April 16 and preparing the following innovations, which should make the system relevant to the needs of the time.  First of all, we took care of improving the automation of the store, and this provides for synchronization of databases: if earlier we supported synchronization with Excel (CSV), now we add support for 1C.  In addition, we pay attention to the support of payment systems. <br>  More news about the news: <br><ol><li>  We update the demo version of the online store. </li><li>  Fully recyclable usability of the administrative part. </li><li>  We update the official website and partner section. </li><li>  Module section for ImageCMS: many interesting expected modules will appear, developed by the development team and partners of the system. </li></ol><br>  In the ImageCMS Shop system, we plan to add the following features: <br><ol><li>  1C (Commerce ML) support for automated import and export of goods and orders. </li><li>  Multilingual - the ability to switch the display languages ‚Äã‚Äãof the front of the online store. </li><li>  Differentiation of access rights - three levels of user access: administrator, manager, user. </li><li>  Analytics attendance online store. </li><li>  Complete statistics on orders with tables and graphs. </li><li>  The ability to assign a discount for goods with which it is cheaper. </li><li>  Behavioral module - shows products depending on the products previously viewed by the user. </li><li>  The ability to create an order instead of the buyer. </li><li>  Payment systems - Yandex.Money, LiqPay, QIWI, Sberbank Receipt. </li></ol><br>  The main goal of all our work on ImageCMS product is to change the attitude towards the web development market, bringing it to a new, profitable level for both developers and end users.  We will be grateful to all users for feedback, ideas and suggestions and believe that together we can achieve this goal! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/139828/">https://habr.com/ru/post/139828/</a></p>
