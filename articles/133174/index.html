We were thrown stones at Tegra, but today the models on inexpensive dual-core processors (we are not talking about Tegra 2), remained on Android 2.2.  In principle, this is the trend of the market that models with dual-core processors did not develop.  And models with fast single-core processors have gained decent graphics co-processors.  The following year, many models have been announced for many manufacturers of tablets on one core. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5f5/e4e/57d/5f5e4e57d0f1f756abcc1cc67a0a83c1.jpg" alt="image">

      The only thing that in my opinion is changing in the line of single-core tablets, is the software - now Android 2.3.5 is used, they are waiting for Android 4, plus high-resolution screens will be offered - 1024 by 768. Android ceased to be demanding on the processor, but demanding on the screen: correct work with different resolutions.  Given these trends, we will develop a successful 121st model: we will give it a new screen, perhaps a new graphics co-processor, and possibly increase the amount of memory.  Let's try to offer the 121st with 8 GB (maybe 16?) Of memory, then, perhaps, there will be a model in a metal case, well, you never know, maybe there are fans of "iron".  We position this model as a road.  For some, it is really quite "road", and in fact lives in people in his pocket.  A metal case here would be more than appropriate. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/50c/26a/6c0/50c26a6c072c3a90ac88caeeb608165f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Plus, the integrated reality services are developing, which we have already tested on the 131st model, we offer in the 141st.  Therefore, the 121st model, perhaps, will offer with two cameras.  Naturally, the screens that we have on the 131st, with high resolution.  The 131st and 141st models will be a priority for this year, and of course we will try to make a tablet model for Tegra 2, because this processor currently has a large number of applications that support it, plus it works very well with large screens .  We have plans in ten-inches, and it will definitely be on Tegra 2, and definitely running Android 3 and higher, since this is the only truly tablet OS.  This is what concerns the ARM. <br><br>  <i>My favorite architecture is at 86</i> <br><br>  As for processors at 86. Here the situation in the tablet world is more understandable, given the problem with the hard drives (70% of the market for screws fell due to the situation in Thailand, the prices of screws and laptops are growing and can grow further), the market is actively reorient from lower price laptops to Windows tablets.  Because, in essence, a person needs to either overpay for a laptop (the price has increased by 20-30%), or pay attention to the tablets.  These devices A little different algorithm of use, but on the other hand, these devices solve similar problems a little differently - not the keyboard, but fingers.  But, in principle, the tasks that are set for a person working on the road - the tablet solves perfectly.  Plus software, which is already on an old laptop, which has already served, and painlessly goes to the tablet from the laptop.  Go to the arch.  86 is very, very light.  No cost to adapt the software, but go to the android tablet to live and work with it - is more difficult.  We will simply expand the range of our Raccoon tablets on Windows (from the cheapest to the cleric). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6ed/b60/8c9/6edb608c90ee0a4f5e23a1fe8511625b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Here are my thoughts on future plans for me, as the ‚Äúmanager-compiler‚Äù of Raccoon tablets.</i>  <i>Shared these considerations with habrovchanami, to listen to alternative views in the comments.</i> <br><br><hr><br>  <a href="http://www.service.muk.ua/">MUK-Service - all types of IT repair: warranty, non-warranty repair, sale of spare parts, contract service</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/133174/">https://habr.com/ru/post/133174/</a></p>
