In the summer you can bask in the sun, run on the grass, swim and splash around in any natural and artificial tanks containing a sufficient number of molecules consisting of two hydrogens and one oxygen - in general, you can relax to the fullest.  Another popular summer fun is catching beautiful insects - naturally, for ‚Äújust look‚Äù!  Something like this it looks like in the performance of the harsh Icelandic guys: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

        </script>
      <br>
    <img src="https://ru.vivaldi.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/970/2018/07/leto.png" alt="image"><br><br>  True, there is one difference.  We catch insects not only to look, but also ... in addition.  Cut, as they say in modern slang.  So we catch and cut, we catch and cut out ... Thanks to the developers of Chromium - they don't let me relax, they help to keep fit. <br><br>  But besides entomology, we also dream.  And our dreams that the browser Vivaldi will soon become the most convenient and functional browser on the planet.  And after we dream, we take a canvas, paint and proceed to the realization of our and, of course, your ideas in life.  This is how we live, with a fly swatter in one hand and with an artist's brush in the other.  Details of our boring summer life - under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Qwant Search </h3><br>  As many have already noticed, both in the test build and in the recent update of the stable branch Vivaldi 1.15, we have added a new search engine to the list of pre-installed ones.  Due to the lack of information (I repent - I didn‚Äôt work), fair questions started - what and why?  Let's explain. <br><br>  The main reason for adding a new engine is our systematic work to ensure the best protection of users from all sorts of interesting services that collect a psychological portrait of network users for the further application of their knowledge for personal gain.  It is unpleasant.  Therefore, when we learned about Qwant, which is gaining popularity in Europe, we immediately decided to make friends with it. <br><br>  The fact that Qwant provides a search, but it does not collect information about the preferences and interests of the user, and also does not install stupid Cookies on users' computers.  We like this approach.  We hope that many users, too.  Therefore, we have concluded a cooperation agreement.  At the same time, we will be able to receive even a small, but deserved income from Qwant for attracting new users of their product.  One more small step to gaining world popularity. <br><br><h3>  Scrolling open tabs list </h3><br>  This feature is an improvement requested by users for a long time, which can be seen even by the bug report number.  We have already implemented the function of visual scrolling of open pages (using Ctrl + scrolling with the mouse wheel or touchpad), at which you could see the "film" from the thumbnails of the open tabs.  Now a new option ‚ÄúDisplay Tab Cycler as List‚Äù has appeared in the settings (the translation has been delayed while on the way): <br><br><img src="https://ru.vivaldi.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/970/2018/07/tabs_cycling.png" alt="image"><br><br>  After its activation, the film will turn into a <s>pumpkin</s> list of tabs and the thumbnail displayed on the left of the page that will become active when you finally stop turning the wheel and release the Ctrl button: <br><br><img src="https://ru.vivaldi.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/970/2018/07/tabs_cycling-2.png" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Auto-hide floating panel </h3><br>  This improvement was a continuation of our work on the sidebar, which with each new improvement becomes a more and more inaccessible example for other browsers. <br><br>  So, in the last <s>series of</s> test builds of the browser, you saw a ‚Äúfloating‚Äù panel - more precisely, hovering over the currently open page, which avoided irritating any normal psyche to reformatting the open page each time you access notes, downloads and other important data placed on the side browser panels. <br><br>  But, as they say, there is no evil without good, just the opposite.  In general, after you open the floating panel, it immediately begins to close part of the active page and some important advertising, often placed in the side column of the page, may accidentally pass your attention and you will not be able to buy something you need. what did you not even guess!  Terrible situation.  We could not ignore this and added a new option ‚ÄúAuto-close Inactive Panel‚Äù (translation in the same place as for the previous new option): <br><br><img src="https://ru.vivaldi.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/970/2018/07/auto-close-panel-1.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Now, to hide the floating panel, just click on any area outside the panel, so that it immediately curled back into the side panel.  Convenient, simple, elegant, incomprehensible, enchanting, etc. <br><br><h3>  Adding a tab to a hosted group </h3><br>  But a very specific option - it will be very much in demand by the inhabitants of the planet Tsentumokulii, who, as you know, the number of eyes is not constant throughout the day and varies from 3 to 20 depending on how interesting they are looking at.  Thus, when working with tabs located in one window that belong to the same group, centuriokulians can simultaneously view three, five, and ten pages at once.  And if they are interested in something, they can add a new page to an existing group and it will immediately appear among those placed in one window. <br><br><img src="https://ru.vivaldi.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/970/2018/07/group.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Naturally, if you remove a tab from a group or when you close it, it will disappear from the placed ones.  The option does not require forced inclusion - it is just now there. <br><br><h3>  Work with a fly swatter </h3><br>  Well, in the list of corrections posted at the end of the article, you can see how we dealt with errors and regressions.  Of the most noticeable and discussed bugs, the display of hidden extension icons in the address bar, the browser crash when working with the unplugged window of development tools, resetting extensions settings when clearing browser data, and more was fixed. <br><br>  That's all for now.
