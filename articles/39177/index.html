  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Private Ubuntu Transition Experience</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Not so long ago, my transition to Linux ended.  I installed myself a Ubuntu distribution.  The process was difficult and took a lot of time and effort, despite the fact that I found the answers to each question on the Internet very quickly. <br><br>  I started my transition by collecting all my software needs in the form of <i>mind maps</i> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/ubuntu/30703/">articles asking for social assistance in selecting software</a> .  I have a few Linux terms among my friends, and there are no friends I could ask for something about.  Thanks to everyone who responded, your help is invaluable!  In gratitude to those who responded and to help other defectors :) I decided to share my transition experience. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  The turning point was the need to switch to a new laptop. That is, I had the opportunity to work in win as before and suffer from installing different distributions, choosing drivers and software on a new laptop - which is very convenient, because  I did not have to overload the laptop as if I had installed the OS on the next partition.  I immediately dealt with my native equipment, which I would have been deprived of, working in a virtual environment.

    <h2>  the Internet </h2>  If you are the owner of a connection through a twisted pair or wifi and you have an intel card - you most likely will not have problems, you can immediately proceed to the next paragraph.  I needed to <a title="connect usb 3g modem from ukrainian people.net and set up connection" href="http://forum.ubuntu.ru/index.php%3Ftopic%3D11590.msg247356">connect a usb 3g modem from ukrainian people.net and set up a connection</a> . <br><br><h2>  Video </h2>  I am the happy owner of NVidia GeForce 9300M G for this driver card was found immediately, as soon as I checked the ‚ÄúUse it‚Äù box in System&gt; Administration&gt; Hardware Devices, confirming that I agree with the use of these drivers. <br><br>  I used to use two monitors in my work activities.  Also, everything is just <i>sudo nvidia-settings</i> and you can configure a second monitor.  I do not recommend saving the data in the config, because  When working without a monitor, Ubuntu may not feel its absence, and you will not see parts of the screen. <br><br>  Tip: it is best to position the monitors by switching the positioning in <i>nvidia-settings</i> to advanced and the absolute positioning of the monitors relative to each other. <br><br><h2>  Sound </h2>  The sound was determined immediately, but quietly.  Installed <a title="Alsa" href="http://www.alsa-project.org/main/index.php/Main_Page">alsa</a> driver, it became better, but not much.  At the very least, the stream began to switch from headphones to speakers automatically. <br><br>  So it was not possible to connect bluetooth stereo headphones: ( <br><br><h2>  Bluetooth </h2>  <a href="http://help.ubuntu.com/community/BluetoothSetup">Bluetooth mouse that was included is easy to connect</a> . <br><br><h2>  Soft without which either :) </h2>  Professional learn tools.

The same can be said about PosgreSQL, MySQL, Apache, PHP, etc. <br><br>  IE Testing - <a title="ies4linux" href="http://www.tatanka.com.br/ies4linux/page/Installation">ies4linux</a> <br><br>  To install Win software under Linux, I use <a title="wine" href="http://www.winehq.org/site/download">wine</a> and <a title="crossover" href="http://torrents.ru/forum/viewtopic.php%3Ft%3D992273">crossover</a> <br><br>  Additional required packages - <a title="winetricks" href="http://kegel.com/wine/winetricks">winetricks</a> <br><br><h3>  Office </h3>  I did not succeed in refusing Office 2007, I installed it under <a title="crossover" href="http://torrents.ru/forum/viewtopic.php%3Ft%3D992273">crossover 7</a> , it was never installed under <a title="wine" href="http://www.winehq.org/site/download">wine</a> . <br><br>  Also, I could not find a full-fledged analogue of <a title="Mindmanager" href="http://thepiratebay.org/search/MindManager/0/99/0">MindManager</a> , it was also installed only under the <a title="crossover" href="http://torrents.ru/forum/viewtopic.php%3Ft%3D992273">crossover</a> and only the 6th version, the 7th one cannot find its template and collapses. <br><br>  Couldn't upgrade to gimp, installed Photoshop CS2 under <a title="wine" href="http://www.winehq.org/site/download">wine</a> <br><br>  PS: What you don‚Äôt need to do, or my bad experience - recompiled gtk, after which the themes stopped to apply normally, some of the interface became ‚Äúsquare‚Äù.  Concluded - no more clever :) <br><br>  Good luck and patience in the transition from Win, I have tried many times to quit.  Now the result pleased.  The system is stable, as I need.  I am sure that now I have full control over my OS and I have a lot of opportunities as a developer. <br><br>  PPS: If you have a desire to put a minus or lower my karma, explain what is wrong.  I'm glad to learn :) Otherwise, some kind of trolling turns out, gentlemen :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/39177/">https://habr.com/ru/post/39177/</a></p>
