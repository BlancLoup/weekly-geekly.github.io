In a separate article, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/66655/">I talked</a> about the services existing in the device - in detail, with pictures. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8f0/12d/541/8f012d541aec6ffce94fb318b3d74f8b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And just the other day I saw a certain ‚ÄúMediaBar‚Äù in special projects on Habr√© ... and it became interesting. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Actually, for the sake of interest, I decided to see, but what has changed there over the year.  I took the second version of popcorn, connected the wires, turned it on.

I just ran through the new services that the company is actively trying to develop. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7ff/2df/d45/7ff2dfd45b7632fc4511dce670488249.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In fact, for a long time I could not understand what kind of Mediabar it was and where it suddenly appeared from, if everything seemed to be + worked before.  It turned out that this is just a special Internet portal, in which there are various Russian-language web services adapted for a television screen.  And in this I saw one of the advantages - in contrast to the numerous foreign "buns" with which all foreign players are used, the media bar services are really sharpened under our cold edges and they are not just for show, they can be very useful!  And if geeks with functional self-assembled multimedia servers (or nettops) are not surprising, then for more ‚Äúmundane‚Äù users this is exactly what is needed. <br><br>  However, even the considered ‚Äúpopcorn‚Äù is not deprived of foreign projects - they are all scattered across numerous pages that are outside the section ‚ÄúPopcronTV Portal‚Äù (he, as I understood, is Mediabar). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cde/20a/aaa/cde20aaaa0ec670843a1f692856a9023.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At the moment there are not so many services and it is their company that is trying to actively develop, stimulating the development of "plug-ins" for a system with, in fact, open source.  The fact that some projects are already someone's results of efforts is indicated by small lines with contact information on some pages - manufacturers of such luxury never allowed themselves;) So, it was doubly interesting to see what the craftsmen were riveting there.  And you know ... I was pleasantly surprised - very interesting things met. <br><br>  For example, the news feed of the NTV channel (my father's favorite channel) - having access to the network, a huge list of plots with a preview screen and a small amount of information appears on the screen, nothing superfluous!  Any of the video cards can be viewed - there, of course, not FullHD is played, but you can see (as many times as you like) only the most interesting, without wasting time on the entire news release.  I think the author of the plugin will work, then it will be similarly possible to watch the news from other channels. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b59/8a9/96e/b598a996ef6b33808783f6701b40649c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The plugin for Russian News Service is similarly executed, but unlike NTV, the information is presented in a slightly different way. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c24/9cd/cc7/c249cdcc7d45a9edcc3163f095d698c3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Several projects are intended for viewing various videos - Video Google Search, GetMovies, RuHD.ru and Russia.ru.  I‚Äôll stop here in a little more detail - Video Google Search is also a new service and allows you to search for videos on various video hosting sites (it‚Äôs convenient that a virtual keyboard was made for entering Cyrillic characters). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/471/197/7c9/4711977c9f38d1386ea140a4a9e8fa68.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But GetMovies was somewhat surprised in that he asks for money for his work;  then I found out on the Internet that this is one of the Russian-language stores of licensed video content (such as video on demand) - well, maybe it has the right to live on TVs ... but still a very unexpected turn of events and I doubt very much that I would use it service. <br><br>  For music there is RPod.ru and PromoDJ with lots of different mixes.  And also - On-Line Radio: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0f9/486/2cc/0f94862cc2265b1ed9fba49216869a1e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/423/56d/220/42356d220f24c6685f412e15790540ff.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bc4/5fc/edd/bc45fcedd49ddfe44ddf5069bbad54cd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  For pictures, as before, Yandex. Photos and Flickr. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/963/87e/187/96387e18772e8b4c017f426a8aa98806.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As a bonus, there is a Google-search for torrent-files (which you can immediately start downloading), the weather forecast is already in two versions;  two built-in games - Black Jack (it is a pity that without harlots) and a kind of "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9d2/d1a/a25/9d2d1aa25a9b91ae339df1dd0368568c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On this, perhaps, everything.  As you can see, a breakthrough after the first model did not happen, but a small progress is very much so.  And then it will only get better - the company BBK holds a rather interesting action, in which the authors of useful plug-ins generously donate.  Therefore, there is every chance that very soon many different services will appear on the screens of some TVs - be it Habr, maps, traffic jams, twitter or something else. <br><br>  Well, everything fell into place, thank you all for your attention) In the very near future there will be several interesting reviews, do not switch! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/97846/">https://habr.com/ru/post/97846/</a></p>
