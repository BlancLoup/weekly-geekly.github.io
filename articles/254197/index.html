Now let's take everything in order ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Lyrical digression</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><h3>  Why? </h3>  After reading several articles from the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/vivaldi/">Vivaldi Technologies AS</a> blog dedicated to the development of the Vivaldi browser and the topic of the developers' forum, namely <i>Gathering wishes</i> , besides the ideas and couple of ideas already voiced in the topic, a thought appeared that had long been in the air - mouse gestures for browsers, including Modified for themselves, not effective enough.  We need a new system that would differ from all existing ones, but at the same time would have, so to speak, backward compatibility with ‚Äúclassic‚Äù gestures.  The idea was also ‚Äúfueled‚Äù by some answers from a representative of Opera to habrovans in his <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/opera/">blog</a> and an unplanned update of versions of the software used and browser extensions on a PC.  "Since the developers of Vivaldi want to make the most user-friendly browser, why not make the version that was customized for their browser," I thought, but it didn't work out.  And now it's time to remember that the title says about Chrome and Firefox.  And all because the alternative version of gestures, even though the edition itself, was still done and it was for these browsers.  Actually, I want to share it with you, but a little lower, first ... <br><br><h3>  A little about gestures. </h3>  With the words ‚Äúmouse gestures in the browser‚Äù, what is your first association?  And with the ‚ÄúSpeed ‚Äã‚ÄãDial‚Äù?  I have Opera.  It is thanks to this browser that users were able to evaluate for the first time the possibilities of using the mouse to navigate in the browser and the convenience of using the Express panel.  And for this, developers want to say a big thank you. <br>  <s>There was also a basket, notes, highlighting the text of links ... Stop.</s>  <s>This I deleted.</s> <br>  What is this all about?  The basic gestures of Opera are taken as a basis in order to preserve compatibility with movements already learned by many users.  All gestures are divided into levels depending on the complexity and the possible frequency of use for users (in my opinion).  Also, all the gestures tried to make as intuitive and versatile as possible so that they were as efficient as possible. </div></div>

    <h3>  Gesture system </h3>  How many gestures do you use when working - 0, 3, 5, 10, more?  Previously, when using 5-8, everything seemed quite fast and convenient.  Not now.  When going over 20, I recalled that feeling when I first started using the first five gestures - how did I live without it before?  So keep in mind - using more gestures is addictive! <br>  There are more than forty gestures in the system, which undoubtedly are many and not all of them are needed, since the majority of the first half plus several gestures are quite enough.  If you do everything on the keyboard and rarely use a mouse, then you hardly need it.  The same applies to those who have long made the most convenient system for themselves.  For those who do not have such a system and those who want to update / improve their system, it may be interesting to get acquainted with the structure of gestures below. <br><br><h3>  Gestures </h3>  The first and third plug-in - for Chrome, the second and fourth - for Firefox.  For convenience of choice, 2 gestures have duplicates, they are marked with brackets - <i>()</i> .  Another thing is that, as you know, mouse control extensions in chrome do not work on system tabs for it.  However, like any other. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/41e/973/251/41e973251359472a94ce1569f3cac0e0.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/657/5dd/86a/6575dd86aad44b67abe6615c58eaa798.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/896/a29/bc9/896a29bc953e48ac9435b6791ecc8326.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d75/6c3/f5b/d756c3f5bbf643e1a1627fbebb1513ff.jpg"><br><br>  From the additional functionality of extensions, I would like to emphasize the following features: <br>  - the use of gestures under any of the main mouse buttons (suitable for both right-handers and left-handers); <br>  - navigation through the tabs menu using the mouse wheel while holding the right mouse button; <br>  - navigate the page using the mouse wheel while holding the right mouse button; <br>  - navigation through the adjacent tabs with the help of Rocket gestures (not for everyone, but the opportunity itself pleases); <br>  - navigate tabs using the mouse wheel (only in Firefox). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/844/8c6/f86/8448c6f861414c58acc35c26c8b13e25.gif"><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Comparison of four gestures extensions in Chrome and Firefox (short text version)</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><h4>  <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/crxmouse-chrome-gestures/jlgkpaicikihijadgifklkbpdajbkhjo">crxMouse Gestures:</a> </h4>  Pros: <br>  - functional <br>  - backup settings <br>  - gestures for links, images, text and using the mouse wheel <br>  - rocker gestures <br>  - adding scripts is possible <br>  Minuses: <br>  - when using the navigation through the list of tabs (Wheel Gestures -&gt; Tab list) it is possible that the page cannot be correctly scaled by Ctrl + mouse wheel <br>  - no Russian, translated into English, French, Chinese (simplified), Chinese (traditional) <br>  - add.  Text functionality with Select like a boss enabled does not work <br>  - slows down if many functions are enabled (if you enable only Enable Mouse Gestures and Enable Super Drag, everything is quite bright) <br>  Conclusion: the most functional for Chrome compared in this article.  The best choice for Chrome. <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/ru/firefox/addon/firegestures/">FireGestures</a> </h4>  Pros: <br>  - different in <s>intelligence and ingenuity with</s> great functionality <br>  - translated into Russian <br>  - backup settings <br>  - works in all tabs <br>  - gestures for links, images, text and using the mouse wheel <br>  - rocker gestures <br>  - go through tabs on the tab bar with the mouse wheel <br>  - additional gestures on the developer‚Äôs site <br>  Minuses: <br>  - not an obvious way to add links to sites <br>  - end-to-end gesture system; to manage links, images, you have to use one of the gestures that are not yet used <br>  Conclusion: the most functional of all compared in this article.  The best choice for Firefox (about a hundred or so commands for gestures) <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gestures-for-google-chrom/jpkfjicglakibpenojifdiepckckakgk/">Gestures for Google Chrome</a> </h4>  Pros: <br>  - works fast <br>  - adding scripts is possible <br>  - backup settings <br>  - gestures for links and text <br>  Minuses: <br>  - not too functional <br>  - no Russian, translated only in English and Japanese <br>  - no gestures for images <br>  - there is no possibility to link gestures to links <br>  Conclusion: fast expansion with basic functionality and not always obvious settings. <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/ru/firefox/addon/mouse-gestures-suite/">Mouse Gestures Suite</a> (the ideological heir to All-in-One Gestures) </h4>  Pros: <br>  - works fast <br>  - quite functional <br>  - translated into Russian <br>  - backup settings <br>  - gestures for images <br>  - go through tabs on the tab bar with the mouse wheel <br>  Minuses: <br>  - settings are not divided into categories, are a complete list. <br>  - no gestures for links and text <br>  - there is no possibility to link gestures to links <br>  Conclusion: fast expansion with more than basic functionality, but inconvenient settings <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/smooth-gestures-plus/kdcjmllhmhnnadianfhhnoefgcdbpdap">Smooth Gestures Plus</a> </h4> It was once free, but since then a lot has changed and not for the better. <br>  Minuses: <br>  - the only paid one considered <br>  - all the time trying to make as ‚Äúmore beautiful‚Äù - autodisnding scrolling in the settings, autodigging gestures when drawing.  It seems that the author of the extension is constantly trying to impose on the user the desired behavior, and only known to him.  It is very distracting, a feeling that this is not a browser control, but a struggle with gestures. <br>  - to configure opening your link in the next tab, and not in a new window, you need to know JS or google <br>  Pros: <br>  &lt;sarcasm&gt; In the settings window immediately after the reminder that you have to activate the extension in order to be able to use it after the trial period, there is a button Print the cheat sheet directly in the extension &lt;sarcasm /&gt; <br>  Conclusion: it is not recommended to install.  For the above reasons, was excluded from the comparison.  Backup settings are also not done. <br><br>  <b>Note:</b> in order for Firefox to control the mouse and work on flash elements, for example.  flash players, you can install <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/ru/firefox/addon/flash-gestures/">Flash Gestures</a> </div></div><br>  <i>So many gestures .. what's left free?</i> <br>  From short - 2 duplicated gestures.  Of those that are longer, the gestures of drawing a square counterclockwise (from any of the corners) are exactly free. <br>  <i>Suppose I want to try, are there any ready-made settings?</i> <br>  You can download the saved settings here: <a href="">https://github.com/nzim/Gestures_backup.git</a> Before installing, do not forget to backup your settings. <br><br><h3>  How to remember? </h3>  To memorize prepared a couple of cheat sheets, and after them a kind of test under the spoiler. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/623/fa0/0d6/623fa00d62004107a17e6b2a0f2b47cf.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e4d/b6a/147/e4db6a147ac941fa975e9cb8d85a88b4.jpg"><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Anchoring test</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  What action do mouse gestures correspond to? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0e4/0bd/e5b/0e40bde5b3834c2fbdcead224a6f5e02.jpg"><br>  Some say that in the picture you can see a UFO.  Whether it is a UFO that arrives and removes posts - is unknown. </div></div><br><h3>  Popular extensions to enhance convenience </h3>  Speaking about the ease of use of navigation can not fail to mention other popular plug-ins for browsers.  Although this topic is not welcome here, but there is no way without them.  So briefly: <br><br><h4>  For Chrome: </h4>  <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock/gighmmpiobklfepjocnamgkkbiglidom%3Futm_source%3Dchrome-app-launcher-info-dialog">AdBlock</a> - ad blocker. <br>  <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/speed-dial-fvd-new-tab-pa/llaficoajjainaijghjlofdfmbjpebpa%3Futm_source%3Dchrome-app-launcher-info-dialog">Speed ‚Äã‚ÄãDial [FVD] - New Tab Page, Sync</a> - Express panel.

As for convenience, I would like to separately mention several utilities for <b>Windows</b> : <br>  <a href="http://www.dicter.ru/">Dicter</a> is a free translator that uses the Google Translate engine.  Translates everything that can be distinguished. <br>  <a href="http://www.picpick.org/en/">Picpick</a> is a great program, a Swiss knife, which includes: screen capture, image editor, showing colors under the cursor and color palette, zoom window, ruler, crosshair, protractor and slate board.  And this is all with a pleasant appearance, in Russian and free of charge for non-commercial use. <br>  <a href="https://getsharex.com/">ShareX</a> is an alternative to Picpick, which includes: screen capture, image editor, uploading a screenshot to popular services, displaying the color under the cursor and color palette, ruler, checking the hash amount, changing the DNS, creating a QR code, FTP client, creating a Tweet message, monitor test. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">If you would change the extension structure for these gestures or integrate into the browser</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  This section is here, since the original idea was in the possible integration of these gestures. <br>  All gestures are divided into 6 levels: <br>  1) basic <br>  2) advanced <br>  3) professional <br>  4) expert <br>  5) expert plus <br>  6) rocker expert <br>  For the convenience of the user, the following features were considered: <br>  - a separate tab / section in the settings tab (for the browser) <br>  - change the settings of all gestures <br>  - assignment of site links gestures <br>  - adding scripts <br>  - export / import tinctures to file <br>  - support of a chain of up to 5 gestures inclusive </div></div><br>  I hope the post was useful.  I would love to read your sets of necessary plugins and programs that increase your productivity. <br><br>  ps Just in case - I have no relation to the extensions or programs listed in the article. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/254197/">https://habr.com/ru/post/254197/</a></p>
