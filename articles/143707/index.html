  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Debian cookbook or how I started working on the official wiki</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In light of the recent release of the official <a href="http://debian-handbook.info/get/now/">http://debian-handbook.info/get/now/</a> I want to share the intermediate result of my own efforts in this direction. <br><br>  As I realize that the impending modernization of the IT infrastructure in my work does not fit in any way only with the inherited schemes from Microsoft, at the end of 2010 I began an intensive study of the possibilities of OpenSource.  The main task was the practical implementation of Linux.  The choice fell on Debian for a number of <s>objective</s> subjective reasons.  Returning to reality, Napoleonic plans for the advent of the Linux era within the same state institution had to be discarded, but despite this, the study of Debian has not stopped and continues to this day. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c9e/444/284/c9e4442845db8da1ac6f4989e744ff84.jpg"><br>  Then what came out of it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Choosing a knowledge base. <br>  Gradually, I faced the problem of storing and processing the received information.  The fact is that a huge array of nuggets of valuable information is very much distributed across a variety of network resources ‚Äî blogs, websites, forums, etc.  The strong, swollen bookmarks section in the browser quickly stopped coping with this task and I began to search for a more flexible solution.  It all started with the doc file on your desktop, which then moved to Google docs.  Then there were thoughts about launching your own blog or publications on specialized sites, but these options, solving some problems, added others. <br>  In the end, I stopped at the official wiki.debian.org.

      Problems. <br>  As it turned out, the unique properties of the OpenSource development principles also have a downside - this is the absence of a single comprehensive universal source of information about Linux.  So I came to the conclusion that I need to find (or create) my own resource for myself according to my tasks.  Further, the study was complicated on average by the inevitably low quality of the presentation of the material.  For example, read man to the tmux multiplexer.  For example, I could not find in these kilobytes of the English text a question to answer how to begin the selection of text for its further copying.  The answer in man is, but I quickly found it in Q &amp; A Habr, thanks to Comrade <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/Sov1et/">Sov1et</a> .  Subjectively, the ArchLinux wiki was the highest quality source.  The next problem (for me) turned out to be that the latest versions of man and howto are always in English.  So I discovered the Google Translate and in parallel began to learn English.  The most difficult (and still unsolved) problem was the loss of interest in theoretical material after solving a practical problem. <br><br>  My attitude to work. <br>  The fact is that I have never considered myself to be IT geniuses who quickly grasp the subject area and who, thanks to this, quickly solve the problem.  As it turned out, an excessive deepening of the topic required <b>for me</b> unreasonably high time costs.  I‚Äôd better spend my free time with my child and my wife.  As an example in Debian, my Realtek 8168/8111 network card did not start on my laptop.  Recipes solutions were found, but demanded a compilation and other unjustified in time gestures.  I discarded such options until better times and just used another network card.  This principle directly influenced the way information was presented - briefly, with a minimum of theory and a maximum of practice, as in laboratory work.  What I did not check for myself, I did not post on the wiki.  Subsequently, it was even necessary to revise the structure of the sections from division ‚Äúby program‚Äù to division ‚Äúby task‚Äù. <br>  And the second.  When studying and working out the material, I adhered to the principle of minimalism.  The system should only have what I need, only the software that I deliberately installed, ‚ÄúJust in case, it can be useful or everyone puts it this way‚Äù - this is not for me.  This created an additional heap of problems, but I am sure that I am moving in the right direction.  For example, I was always confused by the fact that the kde environment depended on mysql-server (as far as I know, Arch does not have this insanity).  I like Kde with its beauty and often unique software, but to kill 150 meters of storage for PIM storage is strategically wrong for me (even in the 4GB system).  Such is the principle. <br><br>  Why Debian?  (subjectively in descending order) <br>  1.Many articles, wiki and howto (including Ubuntu materials) <br>  2. Large literate community. <br>  3. Technical Enterprise level stable version. <br>  4. A large functional package database (curses installer, database of all packages on the site, automatic installation). <br>  6. The ability to fully automatic custom installation of the distribution on bare iron without crutches. <br>  8. There is no need to ‚Äúcut out‚Äù anything from the distribution kit in the minimal installation option (by the <s>way, in the Ubuntu garden</s> , it was decided). <br>  9. Many developers build binary packages for Debian. <br>  10. Independence from major IT players (Google, RedHat, Canonical, etc.) <br>  11. The logical stability of the project itself, tested by time. \ <br>  12. Very busy systems <a href="http://slonik-v-domene.livejournal.com/96331.html">use</a> Debian <br><br>  What I want to achieve. <br>  The principle is simple - <b>in practice,</b> to get a stable universal platform based on a package distribution kit that fully implements the capabilities of both hardware and software.  I know that this can be achieved (if we discard the limited support of iron producers and mainstream directions from Windows), I just haven‚Äôt found / tested <b>how</b> to do it in each particular case.  There is a lot of information, but it is less tested.  For this, I started to fill the wiki. <br><br>  The results of the work. <br>  <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/ru/Step-by-step">Main section</a> <br>  <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/ru/ris">Remote installation section</a> <br>  <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/ru/Motherboard">A little bit of iron</a> <br>  + a number of edits in other sections, for example <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/ru/Crypt">here</a> <br><br>  Resolution. <br>  To date, the Russian-language section of the <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/ru/DebianRussian">official wiki is</a> noticeably behind in the design and content of the reference (for me) <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/">wiki.archlinux</a> .  I do not call for the banal copying of the material, but for the year of subscription to update the root section, I received no more than 10 notifications.  When you need you can (and should) be spied with Arch.  But unfortunately, many, accumulating valuable material do not always share it.  And if it comes, then the material is often duplicated on a variety of resources, or disappears altogether for a variety of reasons.  Therefore, if you have something to add, join the official wiki and begin not only to take, but also competently give the community OpenSource.  I hope my humble example of someone will inspire and the wiki will be at least a little better for both beginners and professionals. <br><br>  Thanks for participating PavloRudyj and IlyaZhelyabuzhsky, everyone who helped me in Habr's Q &amp; A and numerous authors of useful articles on the Internet. <br>  Special technical thanks to my first Gentoo distribution.  It was with him that I began to get acquainted with Linux. <br><br>  UPD 11/16/2013.  Already a year since I switched to Ubuntu LTS.  Causes: A lot more PPA than Debian.  Ubuntu is trite faster and easier to learn.  Already applied for work.  It is important to comply with 2 conditions - only a clean installation and only security updates.  As soon as I complete the basic learning of Linux, I‚Äôll probably go back to Debian, but for ideological reasons only. <br>  I no longer work on the wiki, all knowledge is accumulated in the post-installation script of the network installation.  According to the script I am going to make an article </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143707/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143707/</a></p>
