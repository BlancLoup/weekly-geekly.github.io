      There are many relatively small pieces that can be studied for 30-60 minutes per day for 1-3 months, while covering a very wide layer of material. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/f1/oa/fj/f1oafj1q1dy8e6e4kcb07qg3c1e.png"><br><br>  Certainly, about 1-3 months is completely from scratch.  If you have been working with Azure for the last couple of years, then this resource should be reviewed very quickly, find gaps in your knowledge and go on to prepare for the exam. <br><br><h2>  <b><a href="https://cloudsociety.learning.microsoft.com/courses">CloudSociety.learning</a></b> </h2><br>  <b>There are courses for each section listed in the exam description.</b>  <b>This is such a squeeze, brain dump, which you must know to pass exams.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yb/g2/3c/ybg23cfqb_aqqsr3hfdtvobp8ve.png"><br><br>  You enroll for the course (enroll), read the content, do small test tasks on your own and at the end pass a small test.  I am not ready to guarantee that, having learned the text of all the modules, you will pass the exam, but if you already know Azure, this resource will greatly help reduce the preparation time. <br><br>  In my subjective opinion, courses with CloudSociety (openedx) are as close as possible to what is asked in the AZ series exams and at the same time are free. <br><br>  I will cite here a list of exam preparation courses.  (To get on the openedx version, simply replace the URL ‚Äúcloudsociety.learning‚Äù with ‚Äúopenedx‚Äù). <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">AZ-100</b> <div

<b class="spoiler_title">The same courses can be found openedx, except for one.</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Why Microsoft has 2 sites on its domain on one engine, I absolutely do not understand - after all, part of the courses are published on 2 resources at the same time. <br><br>  And the content is the same, questions and answers, and even the order of the questions.  Find the differences! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dz/m7/0b/dzm70b8tzs2oywh1t-aoz-1ivk4.png"><br><br>  Judging by the fact that the <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/wriju/2018/12/20/free-trainings-for-azure-certifications-az/">article</a> about CloudSociety Learning appeared on December 20th, then, supposedly, CloudSociety will be developing, and not openedx.  In addition, this resource is promoted in many blogs and, probably, CloudSociety will develop further.  (Although now the behavior of Microsoft, I would not dare to predict.) <br><br><ul><li>  I found only one plus in openedx: Microsoft generates course certificates for free.  On edx, you need to pay $ 99 for each, and there are no certificates at all on Cloud Society (as of January 5). <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pa/mu/tz/pamutz3cxprw-vhuxslcnn87ri8.png">  The certificate looks solid, with the signature of the most-most, though it is not clear how these certificates have value. </li><li>  Although there is a minus: on the opened courses it is not visible in the search - they can only be accessed by direct links.  Perhaps this means that this resource is no longer a target, but then the question arises: ‚Äúwhy was it necessary to start a new resource on the same engine, upload content there and advertise it in a blog?‚Äù If someone knows the answer, share this the secret. </li></ul><br>  On OpenEDX, I found only 1 course, which is absent on the Cloud Society.  <a href="https://openedx.microsoft.com/courses/course-v1:Microsoft%2BINF240x%2B2018_T3/info">Configuring and Operating Microsoft Azure Stack</a> (the only unique course for opened, which, by the way, can be seen without a direct link) <br></div></div><br>  But there are some drawbacks to CloudSociety: <br><br><ul><li>  There is no real laboratory work (reference to the instructions in the official documentation is not serious). </li><li>  Half of the sections are video from channel9 / youtube, and it happens that the interface has already changed a little, and in the case of some sections on AAD, even the portal has already changed. </li></ul><br><h2>  <a href="https://www.edx.org/">Edx</a> </h2><br>  <b><a href="https://www.edx.org/">EDX</a></b> is a well-known platform: there are a lot of different courses from leading universities.  There are collected, including, and courses from <a href="https://www.edx.org/course%3Fsearch_query%3Dazure">Microsoft on Azure</a> <br>  What makes <b>EDX</b> globally different from the Cloud Society is clear - this is a <b>platform external to Microsoft</b> , and <b>Microsoft‚Äôs</b> presence on it is a must, since  this is a demonstration of the flag (there are many other good courses, and we should be there), and ‚Äútrading on the red lines‚Äù (maybe someone will pass by and learn our courses, even if they don‚Äôt really want to). <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">But with this platform in December 2018, there was a problem that divided the EDX by zero, for me personally</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  All practical tests became paid, i.e.  for $ 99. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/u8/tn/qr/u8tnqrvj21sjjoay0c_ocfip1m8.png"><br><br>  And the progress on the course will be deleted literally in a month if the course is not paid, even if the course lasts 3 months. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tm/c1/bw/tmc1bwd_hclbalkxsk7japhybpi.png"><br><br>  I understand that <a href="https://blog.edx.org/updates-platform-achieving-long-term-sustainability%3Ftrack%3Dblog">companies need money</a> , but without tests, preparation for Azure exams makes little sense, and with them - this will cost at least a couple of thousand dollars.  And if you believe the <a href="https://blog.edx.org/updates-platform-achieving-long-term-sustainability%3Ftrack%3Dblog">approach announced in the spring of 2018</a> , it is unlikely that the tests will be made free again.  Naturally, I don‚Äôt read the EDX blog, so I first learned about the changes through the following portal message, which surprised me a lot. <br><br>  It became somehow unpleasant, but it is clear why Microsoft needs its own resource.  In my opinion, <b>Microsoft cannot rely in such an important process as training on the goodwill of an external company</b> , which they have no influence on.  Therefore, you need your own resource, which, if anything, will replace it and who will not need to earn money.  But this is just my opinion. <br></div></div><br><h2>  <b><a href="https://academy.microsoft.com/en-us/professional-program/">Microsoft Professional Program</a></b> </h2><br>  There is an <a href="https://academy.microsoft.com/en-us/professional-program/">MPP</a> program (which replaces Microsoft Virtual Academy and many other training resources), within which you can complete a track that includes several 9-12 courses on edx and receive one general certificate that you graduated from this track (passed tests, labs, etc.) <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">All MPP courses are hosted on the EDX platform, and in 2019, a problem arose:</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  You can take tests for courses only for money, without them the course will not be marked as completed on the MPP site.  As a result, a general MPP certificate can be obtained only by paying $ 99 for each course.  I hope that Microsoft will be able to transfer information about passing courses from EDX to its Cloud Society platform without losing progress, otherwise it will discredit the MPP program. <br></div></div><br>  In the context of passing Azure exams, we are interested in the <a href="https://academy.microsoft.com/en-us/professional-program/tracks/cloud-administration/">Cloud Administration track</a> in the first place, because  It includes the following courses: <br><br><ul><li>  Microsoft Professional Orientation: Cloud Administration </li><li>  Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines </li><li>  Microsoft Azure Virtual Networks </li><li>  Microsoft Azure Identity </li><li>  Microsoft Azure Storage </li><li>  Microsoft Azure App Service </li><li>  Databases in Azure </li><li>  Azure Security and Compliance </li><li>  Automating Azure Workloads </li><li>  Migrating Workloads to Azure </li></ul><br>  <b>The same courses can be found on the Cloud Society.</b>  Courses from this program do not correlate with the Azure exams because they are much simpler, but you can start learning Azure and prepare for the AZ-100 exam from there. <br><br>  <b>In addition to tests, there is also laboratory work in the real cloud.</b>  <b>I strongly recommend them to do, because</b>  <b>The AZ series exams also have labs that need to publish something, repair something in a real cloud.</b>  <b>Hands-on experience is invaluable when taking az-100 / az-101</b> . <br><br>  I would use this program as the minimum admission to work with Azure in the company.  I got it - get access, I didn't get it - sorry, but additional tests are needed.  The course is simple, I would even say, suitable for second-year students (who have already learned to study the material themselves, as in high school, and not as in middle ‚Äî the teacher will tell all the topics, the main thing is to attend diligently). <br><br>  <b>I would highly recommend <a href="https://academy.microsoft.com/en-us/professional-program/tracks/internet-of-things/">Azure IoT</a> as a track to prepare for an architectural exam.</b>  Although this track is weaker than the Big Data courses, there are still 4 courses in it that are worth seeing: <br><br><ul><li>  Getting Started with the Internet of Things (IoT) </li><li>  IoT Data Analytics and Storage </li><li>  IoT Architecture Design and Business Planning </li><li>  Business Intelligence for IoT Solutions </li><li>  They cover both the Azure Iot Reference Architecture, an example - RFP (request for proposal) for an IoT solution, and reviews of services like PowerBi, Time Series, Hot / Cold storage, Event / IoT hubs. </li></ul><br>  You can still learn the tracks <a href="https://academy.microsoft.com/en-us/professional-program/tracks/devops/">DevOps</a> , <a href="https://academy.microsoft.com/en-us/professional-program/tracks/big-data/">Big Data</a> , but this is outside the stated topic. <br><br><h2>  <a href="https://app.pluralsight.com/roleiq">Pluralsight RoleIQ</a> </h2><br>  You can pass Azure knowledge testing for free in 3 directions: architecture, development, infrastructure, and get some 0-300 of your knowledge as a result.  Each role consists of several tests 6-9, which allows a comprehensive look at their knowledge.  (You need to create an account, you do not need to bind the card, you do not need to start a free trial either. Tests are available without it).  Architecture example <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dq/0o/c3/dq0oc3ubkk7ppqnelwjf6-xb9nq.png"><br><br>  In my opinion, these are good <b>qualitative</b> tests ( <b>there is a qualitative, and there is a quantitative method that will give value</b> ) to evaluate your knowledge. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Numerical estimates meant little to me, since</b>  <b class="spoiler_title">I did not agree with the formulation of many questions, as well as with the answers.</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  The simplest examples are questions like: ‚ÄúOn which blade you can find these metrics‚Äù and then 4 choices.  Taking into account the fact that the portal is rapidly changing, and I don‚Äôt remember the names of the tabs personally, this question is not correct in terms of testing. </li><li>  Or a task: ‚Äúchoose the right method to remove the message from the queue‚Äù.  Common sense has let me down in it, because  I chose <b>queue.Dequeue</b> instead of the correct <b>queue.DequeueMessage</b> .  In my opinion, such questions are very strange, because it will always prompt Auto-complete in any IDE. </li><li>  Well, or the question: "What are the most commonly used states of connection to a resource, in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/circuit-breaker">circuit-breaker</a> pattern in a popular implementation?"  How to say: ‚Äúfrequently used and popular implementations‚Äù is a straightforward ‚Äúexact‚Äù question.  It remains to measure the popularity and frequency of use of states. </li></ul><br></div></div><br>  Each question is given a <b>time limit</b> , depending on the length of the text of the question + all the answers.  But if you want to hack the system, it will be hard, because  time is given not much. <br><br>  For all this, the <b>estimate is nonlinear</b> , i.e.  You have passed 17 out of 20 questions - you will receive 255 out of 300. It depends on the complexity of the tasks and at what point you made a mistake.  For me personally, such a system is a bit confusing (it turns out that if you made a mistake in the beginning, this is bad, and if closer to the end, it is less scary), but <b>it gives a qualitative result.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gz/eo/8n/gzeo8nexhvycw9swo1yhqe0ce8m.png"><br><br>  <s>By the way, you can entertain your self-esteem, because</s>  <s>at the end of each test, they give not only an estimate, but also the percentage of people who passed better than you.</s>  <s>It is pleasant to see that 1-3% surrendered to you better.</s> <br><br>  I see this test as a way to divide the mass of those who want to learn into several groups according to their initial skills. <br><br><ul><li>  If a person has passed an average of 200-250, then he has nothing to do on training. </li><li>  If 100 - he is clearly in the group of beginners. </li></ul><br>  After passing the test, they will recommend courses that close the gaps in knowledge, but these courses are already for money. <br><br><h2>  Pluralsight courses </h2><br>  In January 2019, the path appeared to prepare directly for the AZ series exams (since the authors did not have the az-203 way, they were also not ready for Microsoft‚Äôs tricks with the abolition of az-200 / az-201). <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/paths/microsoft-azure-infrastructure-and-deployment-az-100">az-100</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/paths/microsoft-azure-integration-and-security-az-101">az-101</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/paths/microsoft-azure-architect-technologies-az-300">az-300</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/paths/microsoft-azure-architect-design-az-301">az-301</a> </li><li>  az-203 ( <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/paths/microsoft-azure-developer-core-solutions-az-200">az-200</a> / <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/paths/microsoft-azure-developer-advanced-solutions-az-201">az-201</a> </li></ul><br>  What is the path to the preparation course?  Judging by the dates (some of the courses were made in August, even before the announcement of new exams), the <b>content was not originally made for these exams, but only after the announcement of new tests from the courses paths covering the topics from the exam were formed.</b> <br><br>  Unfortunately, I can‚Äôt say anything about the relevance of these courses to the exams themselves.  They came out recently, the amount of content there is huge, but I also have a paid subscription now. <br><br>  But I repeat once again: it looks very close to what is described on the pages with exams. <br><br><h2>  <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/">Azure Architecture Center</a> </h2><br>  A good resource created by the team <a href="https://github.com/mspnp">Patterns and Practices</a> , which with a very big desire can be mastered in a day (read all the articles). <br><br><ul><li>  You can deal with the <b>patterns</b> that pnp commands have allocated (I‚Äôm not saying that rocket technologies, but they don‚Äôt write about space either in GangOf4).  For example, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/competing-consumers">competing-consumers</a> .  These patterns are found in courses AZ-300, and may be found in exams. </li><li>  Read <b>Checklists</b> in different directions.  For example, the <b>Resiliency / Scalability</b> checklist (also not quantum chromodynamics, but checklists are not created for this, but in order not to miss something by chance) </li><li>  You can see simple <b><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/data/stream-processing-stream-analytics">reference architecture</a></b> <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bi/xe/gc/bixegc3wbzv1clksxql4wgigynm.png"></li><li>  Well, a lot more interesting. </li></ul><br>  This resource will be <b>useful to read</b> not only those who are going to be a cloud <b>architect</b> , but also <b>developers</b> , because  It is for them to implement these templates, and at the same time <b>itpro</b> some things will be interesting, such as the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/cloud-adoption/business-strategy/cloud-migration-business-case">myths about the migration to the Cloud</a> . <br><br><h2>  <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/">Official documentation</a> </h2><br>  This is a <b>great place to learn</b> , because  only it is the official source of truth. <br><br>  You can spend hours and even days reading, watching, even trying to repeat what is shown in the documentation.  I see 3 problems: <br><br><ol><li>  Lack of laboratory work.  This is a huge minus, because  for many people, ‚Äúmuscular‚Äù memory is better than visual. </li><li>  Mostly outdated documentation (or at least screenshots).  The documentation is huge.  For example, when I last checked, there were 9000 pictures in it, which were not referenced at all in the documentation.  True, those that were referenced were 50 thousand, but many needed to be updated.  With the text is the same. </li><li>  Sometimes there is simply no answer to the right questions in the documentation and the only way to find a solution is to make it by trying all the options. </li></ol><br>  But all these 3 problems still do not outweigh the fact that <b>documentation is the main source of theoretical knowledge</b> . <br><br><h2>  <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/">Channel9</a> </h2><br>  <b>Channel9 is not a resource for learning about Azure.</b>  At best, this is a place where you can get a notification about the existence of a new feature, but the details are only in practice and in the documentation.  Therefore, I personally download videos selectively before a business trip, to look at the plane.  Fortunately, for the month, usually 5-6 pieces of 10 minutes each appear. <br><br><h2>  <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/">Azure Blog</a> </h2><br>  This resource is better and more detailed than Channel9, but is close to it in its essence and is suitable for receiving notifications about new features.  Sometimes there are technical details that cannot be found even in the documentation (which makes me wonder), but to find such moments is like searching for needles in a haystack.  Therefore, I have crossed out this source for myself. <br><br><h2>  <a href="https://github.com/azure-samples/">Github repositories</a> </h2><br>  There are so many samples on github.  <a href="https://github.com/azure-samples/">For example</a> , the examples here are quite good, they have done a lot for all services, and they usually cover the needs of developers / architects quite well.  I would not call github a resource for exam preparation, since  there is nothing specific to the AZ series exams.  But as a place where you can see code samples on the stated topics of the exam, completely. <br><br>  One problem: the support of these examples is almost zero.  I opened up issues / pull requests and considered luck if there was at least a response in a month.  New features through issue have never been added.  But in some cases, pull request was accepted, but not always.  At the same time, I was not some no name user, but an employee of the company, but this generally had no effect. <br><br><h2>  <b><a href="https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/search">Azure User stories</a></b> </h2><br>  Microsoft likes to publish marketing materials.  From them you can learn some examples of how customers use Azure.  This does not help much when passing the exam, but at least you can form a picture of the world.  You can start with this link <br><br>  There are also some more <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/techcasestudies">technical information</a> where interesting examples from the hackathons fast.  I really liked this resource, because  there is usually both a visual picture, how it looks from the point of view of architecture (what is connected with it) and an explanation of why.  Here are a couple of examples of such cases: <br><br><ul><li>  The person had an <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/techcasestudies/iot/2017/03/09/plasmd.html">injury in the locomotor system</a> .  It takes a long time to recover, and there are few places in specialized centers.  The idea - let's write out faster, so that more people turn around, and put <a href="https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/inail">Kinect</a> connected to the Internet to the person‚Äôs home.  If a person moves - well, the doctor can see how often and correctly.  If the opposite does not use - take action. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gq/ma/3b/gqma3bspnlfbh1inlhakrdhk96a.jpeg"></li><li>  Or road workers / mechanics / locksmiths whose hands are occupied, but you can voice <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/techcasestudies/bot%2520framework/2017/06/19/Powel.html">ask the bot</a> ‚Äúwhen and who repaired this section of the road‚Äù or ‚Äúis there a part in the warehouse‚Äù.  If the phone is fixed on the helmet, then you can say: ‚Äútake a photo‚Äù so that you don‚Äôt climb into your hands with your elbows in the tar, but fix the result of the repair and attach it to the report. </li><li>  Well and at the worst, any <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/techcasestudies/iot/2017/03/30/PeakUp.html">connected farm</a> </li></ul><br>  It is very interesting to see what people do and what ideas they generate. <br><br><h4>  Lynda </h4><br>  A couple of days ago, an <a href="https://www.lynda.com/Azure-tutorials/Exam-Prep-Microsoft-Azure-Infrastructure-Deployment-AZ-100/5005068-2.html">AZ-100</a> course appeared on this resource, but there was nothing specialized in architecture or design. <br><br><h2>  The way of studying-passing examinations-certification recommended by me </h2><br>  If you are <b>a project manager</b> using Azure, I would recommend the following set of resources and steps to learn: <br><br><ol><li>  Microsoft Professional Program -&gt; Cloud Administration track (General overview of basic services. You can not donate laboratory work, but read the content will be correct). </li><li>  Of course, you have to google a lot more, because  specialized content for AZ-900 at the time of writing the article Internet. </li><li>  Exam AZ-900 (exam confirming that you know all the key concepts on Azure) </li></ol><br>  If you are <b>ITPro</b> <br><br><ol><li>  Courses on the Cloud Society included in the Microsoft Professional Program -&gt; Cloud Administration track (General overview of basic services. You can not donate laboratory work, but read the content will be correct) </li><li>  Cloud Society - AZ-100 / AZ-101 preparation materials </li><li>  On RoleIQ Pluralsight -&gt; RoleIQ -&gt; Microsoft Azure Administrator (go through tests to verify your skills) </li><li>  Exam AZ-900 (exam confirming that you know all the key concepts on Azure) </li><li>  Exam AZ-100 without fail.  <i>AZ-101 at will or as needed.</i> </li></ol><br>  If you are a <b>developer</b> (and know .net / C #) <br><br><ol><li>  Courses on the Cloud Society included in the Microsoft Professional Program -&gt; Cloud Administration track (A general overview of basic services developers need, because not all projects can be done on pure PAAS, but you still need to understand basic infrastructure services, because the same AKS is based, after all, on VMs connected to Vnets with Load Balanced, Public IP, Network Security Groups, etc.) </li><li>  Cloud Society - AZ-200 / AZ-201 Preparatory Materials </li><li>  On RoleIQ Pluralsight -&gt; RoleIQ -&gt; RoleIQ Pluralsight -&gt; RoleIQ -&gt; Microsoft Azure Developer (tests pass, to make sure in their skills) </li><li>  <i>AZ-900 Not required, but useful (an exam confirming that you know all the key Azure concepts.</i> ) </li><li>  Exam AZ-203 </li></ol><br>  If you do not know C # /. Net, it will be harder for you to pass, but it is possible, because  All C-like languages ‚Äã‚Äãare very similar, and you can look at the API without knowing C #. &lt; <br><br>  If you are an <b>Architect</b> (Solution or any other type).  This path will be the longest, but "There are no royal paths to geometry." <br><br><ol><li>  Courses on the Cloud Society included in the Microsoft Professional Program -&gt; Cloud Administration track (General overview of basic services. You can not pass laboratory work, but the content will be correct) </li><li>  Courses on the Cloud Society included in the Microsoft Professional Program -&gt; IoT track </li><li>  Cloud Society - AZ-300 / AZ-301 preparation materials <br><ul><li>  <i>Cloud Society - AZ-100 / AZ-101 preparatory materials (Not mandatory, but very useful, because you can look at the same services from a different angle)</i> </li><li>  <i>Cloud Society - AZ-200 / AZ-201 preparatory materials (Not mandatory, but very useful, because you can look at the same services from a different angle)</i> </li></ul></li><li>  I highly recommend passing the AZ-900 exam.  (The test confirms that you know all the key concepts in Azure. For Architects, this is a Checkpoint in which you can make sure that you are on the right path) </li><li>  On RoleIQ Pluralsight -&gt; RoleIQ -&gt; RoleIQ Pluralsight -&gt; RoleIQ -&gt; RoleIQ Pluralsight -&gt; RoleIQ -&gt; Microsoft Azure Solution Architect (pass tests to verify their skills) <br><br><ul><li>  <i>RoleIQ Pluralsight -&gt; RoleIQ -&gt; RoleIQ Pluralsight -&gt; RoleIQ -&gt; Microsoft Azure Developer (Optional, but additional practice won't hurt)</i> </li><li>  <i>RoleIQ Pluralsight -&gt; RoleIQ -&gt; Microsoft Azure Administrator (Optional, but additional practice won't hurt)</i> </li></ul></li><li>  Explore material at the Azure Architecture Center </li><li>  Exam AZ-300/301 is mandatory, because  donating one without the other is not much point. </li></ol></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/435602/">https://habr.com/ru/post/435602/</a></p>
