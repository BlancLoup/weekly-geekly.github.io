If not, then I confess that in addition to a heap of problems with setting up and raising the working capacity of this device there is another not unimportant surprise - the temperature of work! <br><br><img src="http://img694.imageshack.us/img694/8350/93838810.jpg" alt="image">

      So, my 2 weeks of <s>dancing with a tambourine of the</s> settings of this device ended with the release of a fresh firmware, then this nuance took a little time and experimentation. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  How the world was created </h4><br>  One day in the icy winter season ... in the evening he brought home the D-Link 2600U and unexpectedly turned it on for everyone!  And after 2 weeks he earned (omit these details).  There were no complaints about the work.  If he was forced to work, then "What's on the box, then in the box" (c) Jumble.  :) <br>  But summer has come.  The room in which the router was located was sunny and the temperature made it known that it was impossible to live in a room.  Or you can, but not for long.  Exactly the router itself took it to the living.  He was so heated that he did not want to work, and he couldn‚Äôt hold his hand on the plastic top for a long time.  I climbed into the ‚Äúfavorite search engine‚Äù and read as one quick-witted uncle put a can of 3 liters of water on it and thus decided the question.  I imagined that I‚Äôm still in charge of fish in it ... And this is somehow not part of my plans.  I did not have work, I was not used to being bored ... And I decided to cure this ailment. <br><br>  <i>Lyrical digression: modding was already done half a year ago, but now I decided to share this decision.</i>  <i>Because the photos from the moment of execution were not taken ... but still I will try to convey to the lovers of this business the most detailed manufacturing process :)</i> <br><br><h4>  What is needed? </h4><br>  Yes, what I found in the drawer: <br><ul><li>  radiators for video card memory, </li><li>  the cooler from her (it is worth noting that the Chinese cooler was awarded 3 blue LEDs, which, of course, fueled my interest in this whole procedure), </li><li>  lattice (like 40 mm). </li></ul><br>  From the tools I had to climb into the pantry for: <br><ul><li>  drill and circular saw attachment, </li><li>  glue gun </li><li>  and a soldering iron. </li></ul><br>  The last, sobsno, lies in the drawer, because  I do not trust the inhabitants of my house)) <br><br><h4>  Go!  Or flew ... </h4><br>  First we open the router.  Outside, the bolts were not noticeable, so by turning on the guess, we gently pull off the soft plugs. <br><br><img src="http://img710.imageshack.us/img710/6338/15871526.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Voila!  And here are the bolts!  Turn off. <br><br><img src="http://img706.imageshack.us/img706/5809/37246139.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The next step is to inspect the board.  (I apologize for the quality of the photo ... I found it in the tyrnet, since mine was already plastered with radiators.) <br><br><img src="http://img189.imageshack.us/img189/7217/96327749.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We don't notice anything interesting, a few chips and no hint of cooling.  Fingers make sure that they all warm up and glue radiators on them.  At first I decided that this would be enough, but the lid still remained hot.  I did not wait for it to overheat again ... ** and looked at the cooler with a malicious grin.  &gt;: D <br><br><img src="http://img717.imageshack.us/img717/1144/13065373.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Power supply external, 12 volts.  For the cooler, we need power at 12V, so we immediately aim at the input.  Solder directly to the nest rejected the option immediately, because  when you press the shutdown button, the cooler will continue to spin, which does not make sense.  We begin to peer and look for a place after the key ... And notice the unused technological holes for some kind of diode.  Turn on the soldering iron and solder it there.  From the side where the key goes plus (oddly enough :)).  There plus!  And in another hole - a minus.  Thanks, Cap! <br><br><img src="http://img705.imageshack.us/img705/1968/20376917.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Now we need to attach the cooler to the radiators.  In a barbaric way, screw a small cog right between the radiator fins.  I hooked on 1 screw so that you can correct the position of the cooler ... But more on that later. <br><br><img src="http://img6.imageshack.us/img6/5744/34328814.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And so, radiators are installed.  Cooler soldered.  Cooler secured.  It remains to close and enable.  And at the very first action we break off, the cooler is not sunk into the radiators, but stands on top, because it does not have enough space and the lid does not close.  And in general ... Why close the cooler that shines with blue diodes?! .. The meaning of these diodes?  ** and looked with an evil grin on the drill with a circular saw.  &gt;: D <br><br><img src="http://img694.imageshack.us/img694/1791/90236093.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Measure out as accurately as possible the center of the hole and make a hole.  Hmm ... cap?  Plastic is not very good for this, it is worth being careful here.  He melted more than cut out. <br><br><img src="http://img697.imageshack.us/img697/7343/22254888.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Now close.  Shut down?  Hooray!  We recall that we fixed the cooler on one screw, and it is not always possible to carefully cut a hole.  Therefore, we correct the cooler so that it is smooth and beautiful.  :) <br><br><img src="http://img246.imageshack.us/img246/8668/51045779.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I don‚Äôt want to leave an empty hole ... There will always be someone <s>clever and</s> curious who wants to shove that thread there and hold the cooler.  The grid is needed more as a psychological factor than as a means of protection.  The question remains how to fix it. <br><br><img src="http://img638.imageshack.us/img638/9417/77622281.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Drilling plastic I have a desire to disappear immediately.  Therefore, we take the glue gun and make such drops in the loops. <br><br><img src="http://img8.imageshack.us/img8/1599/64802509.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Eh ... rod with glue got a yellow shade!  There would be a transparent white ... Let's survive!  Or in the future we will change :) <br><br><img src="http://img442.imageshack.us/img442/2113/49749476.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Secured!  We connect wires and with impatience and easy excitement we press the <s>big red</s> power button.  Eh ... Beautiful! <br><br><img src="http://img229.imageshack.us/img229/6555/47545120.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And this is how it looks on the wall) <br><br><img src="http://img197.imageshack.us/img197/7489/12714839.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We rejoice ... We drink cognac ... <s>We change passwords ...</s> )) <br><br>  <b>Thanks for attention!</b>  Do not judge strictly, this is my first post on Habr√© :) <br><br>  <b>PS</b> Thanks for the karma!  Transferred to thematic :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/85343/">https://habr.com/ru/post/85343/</a></p>
