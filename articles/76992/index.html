  <section class="page js-page"><h1>No one is to blame, but what to do?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  David Pogue, in his relatively <a title="fresh column" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/26/technology/personaltech/26pogue.html">fresh column</a> in The New York Times, writes about the trends of the near future and the recent past.  Well, you know, there, about projectors built into cameras and microprojectors in general.  Or, say, about the end of the megapixel war (senseless and merciless) and the beginning of the war of matrix sizes.  For example, to improve (or rather, do) the capabilities of ordinary consumer digital cameras in low light conditions.  He still writes a lot there, which is almost not applicable to our realities.  Well, for example, that the local mobile operators were pressed to the nail - they tear, they say, from unfortunate Americans 20 cents per SMS, while the cost price of sending SMS is equal to absolute zero (for a message 200 bytes is ultimately transmitted through the Internet).  Or here's another.  Netbooks  Remember the first models?  This hell and horror, terrible brakes, weak batteries ... And now - quite a decent Internet terminals, with GPS, WiMAX and other bells and whistles for the same money.  About app stores that can turn your phone into a barcode scanner, or just into a scanner, or into a game console, or whatever else you want there for $ 1, Pog, of course, writes, too.  But I do not Pogue, and do not pretend.  And today I am writing about something else. <br><br>  You have noticed that out of tons of new techniques, technologies, ideas, discoveries - anything, nothing comes from Russia.  The Russians are famous in the world for allegedly stealing content, apparently breaking into computer networks and, as it were, owning botnets.  Are there any modern civil technologies that were invented and introduced in Russia, and now the whole world uses them?  Well, at least something?  I really hope for your comments, because I myself could not remember anything.  Well, for the sake of justice, we can call it ‚Äúradio‚Äù, but it was not invented in Russia, but in the Russian Empire, it‚Äôs impossible to call technology modern at all, and indeed, the patent for radio, as we know, was not received by <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2581_(%25D0%259A%25D0%259A)">Popov</a> , but even <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0,_%25D0%259D%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0">Tesla</a> and as if even <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8">Marconi</a> .  What else?  Internet, DVD, non-linear video editing, automatic gearbox, color inkjet printing, even Teflon coating for irons - none of the above is invented in Russia. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  You, of course, now object to me, they say, that‚Äôs <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gagarin">Gagarin</a> !  Here are our " <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2581_(%25D0%259A%25D0%259A)">Progress</a> " - the main transport to the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html">ISS</a> !  I object.  This is not civilian technology.  Civilians are won, <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceShipOne">SpaceShipOne</a> .  To abandon the entire economy and industry of the country to create the necessary technology is not a big deal.  But to make technology available to consumers - this is the task for which it is necessary to spin.

      What is happening in Russia?  We are waiting for the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ru/iphone/">iPhone 3Gs</a> to enter the market and rub our hands, waiting for the Amazon <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015T963C/ref%3Dsv_kinh_0">Kindle 2</a> ordered.  Some people gloat over <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/11/30/crunchpad-end/">CrunchPad</a> 's, someone - curses the iTunes Store what it is worth because of the inability to buy music in it, while in Russia.  That is, to invent and implement something cool and in demand does not work out - we sit, we wait until they bring it to us and customs clearance. <br><br>  It may seem that I am a vile insinuator, provoking the venerable public to hurray-patriotic speeches.  Who knows, it is likely that it is.  However, I have completely different goals.  I want to understand whether we are doomed to live in a state of chronic lag, whether this lag leads to the reproduction of ourselves (the more we lag behind, the more we lag behind), can we somehow get out of this half-century pit?  Such is ‚ÄúWhat to do?‚Äù Without ‚ÄúWho is to blame?‚Äù.  After all, the main problem is that there is no Russian technology.  That is not - and that's it.  Even our designers work in Photoshop and other Illustrators.  I'm not for meaningless patriotism, like, let's do Russian Linux, or photoshop.  I am for development, not mindless use.  We have a very developed second and completely missing the first.  That is, the bicycle was invented before us.  Again, in one form or another, we sit on an already invented bicycle and try to either catch up with the leaders, or (which happens much more often) ride this bicycle in our own way, which, as the practice of recent decades shows, leads nowhere.  And while the leaders are creating new vehicles, we continue to cut through the frosty roads of our homeland, all on the same bike. <br><br>  The problem of secondary, in general, on the face.  And it concerns, as it turned out, not only <a href="http://rosnovsky.ru/archives/2229">the Runet Awards</a> , but high technologies in Russia as a whole.  I do not see a way out, and you? <br><br>  Discussion topic - in the next issue of <a href="http://rosnovsky.ru/">my podcast</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/76992/">https://habr.com/ru/post/76992/</a></p>
