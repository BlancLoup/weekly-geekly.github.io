No, no, binding to the games has not gone away!  But this time, the company took care of a somewhat different kind of gamers - about users of portable set-top boxes.  Happy owners of PSP and Nintendo - tremble!  :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/437/f5e/dda/437f5edda47f3699ddc81ce4bf712ba8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Equipment </h3><br>  - Headphones <b>Razer Moray +</b> ; <br>  - Two sets of linings; <br>  - Adapter for Sony PSP 2000/3000; <br>  - Adapter for Nintendo DS Lite / DSi; <br>  - Y-shaped adapter for connecting to a PC; <br>  - Case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/829/f10/2d9/829f102d9d8988306ca72ffa2c880511.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Packaging is not as cool as in more expensive products of the company, but more interesting than many similar devices in this price category.  Boxing of black matte cardboard with transparent inserts through which headphones can be seen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4fb/778/cb3/4fb778cb346a0b49b0ee1eb172de74b7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I really liked the black and green case, which is not even visible at first.  It is a zippered cloth case with a company logo.  Inside the "shells" behind the net there are several divided pockets, each of which is assigned an icon.  However, it‚Äôs possible to figure out where to dive in and on your own) On the one hand, the pocket is large - under the headphones themselves and under the bag with additional attachments.  On the other hand - three pockets - two for adapters for consoles and one for a Y-shaped adapter to the computer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1cc/bae/27b/1ccbae27be43f36fe6cfe7a98d7dab2e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  By the way, I used these headphones with the <b>Nexx NMP-280</b> player ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/54995/">review</a> ), which fits here just as well.  Despite the fact that I do not have any of the supported prefixes, I did not begin to spread adapters and other artifacts, because  they do not interfere at all - in general, the issue of the cover, which easily fits in your pocket, is perfectly solved. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f81/fcc/ca5/f81fccca50c901762c130056c45858f0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/704/ae3/f36/704ae3f361601e09a15a1cd40faaf534.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There is a slight thickening on the headphone wire - this is nothing more than a microphone.  The fact that it is, you can judge by another contact on the minijack.  The Y-shaped adapter from the kit is just needed in order to connect the headphones to the computer (at the laptop) and as a result get a means to communicate in the same skype if the built-in tools do not allow.  The connectors are painted in the appropriate colors - you will not get confused even if you wish. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/008/031/9c4/0080319c4293526ff2f15055b27cd360.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Headphones </h3><br>  As I said, the earphone has a <b>Apple iPhone</b> compatible microphone, which is located on the right ‚Äúshoulder‚Äù of the headphones.  By the way, the shoulders are the same in length (30 cm), the wire itself is stretched to a full meter.  This meter and two 3-centimeter shoots are made of pleasant material, which is somewhat similar to silicone, but I think it is not him.  The wire is somewhat gelatinous, after any deformation takes the same shape ... but it cannot be said that it is as hard as a metal rod - it twists perfectly, wound around a finger, around a player, etc.  Thanks to all this, the wire is practically not tied into knots (for two weeks of use, it has never faced a serious situation).  I recalled from the bashorga " <i>for those who listen to the player, there are no unbreakable nodes</i> ") <br>  Contact is direct, not L-shaped, which, as practice shows, is more durable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/df6/b14/51d/df6b1451dce1275986d1d01131117eae.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Now a little about the liners themselves.  They are very small, spherical.  Black matte with semi-gloss inserts, which is divided by a thin silver ring.  On the outside of the ‚Äúball‚Äù there is a silver logo of the company, the letters ‚ÄúL‚Äù and ‚ÄúR‚Äù are located on the inside. <br>  Nozzles change in the most usual way, in a set their two pairs - more and less than those that are worn initially. <br>  All three nozzles sit comfortably in your ear and hold onto it carefully, but I decided to stop at the default value. <br><br>  In this situation, the ambient noise becomes much more muffled, but still, remains audible.  When listening to the outside world can not be heard, however, as the world does not hear the horror that you listen to) <br><br>  The sound listened to everyone on the same tracks (The Qemists, Pendulum, Noisia, Nervous from DJ Fresh, NTL) - I really know how they actually sound) Well, the sound from Razer did not let us down this time either.  Everything is clear, there are no artifacts, the bass is at a very good quality level - I think, lovers of drama will appreciate.  At maximum volume (in the aforementioned player, Samsung Jet phone, media center) there are no rattles, rustles and crunches. <br>  Comparing with <b>Fischer Audio Equilibrium</b> , which I had before - the Razer is noticeably louder, richer and more easily isolated from sewage from the outside.  Any other epithets will not be selected - I‚Äôll already consider what is there for PR) <br><br>  Once again, I note that the headphones get along well with the iPhone.  Yes, they do not have a button for lifting the tube and pause in the player, but all this is not so difficult to press on the screen.  But regular sound quality headphones are an order of magnitude lower (+ to this, they very quickly become irretrievably dirty and the rubber ‚Äúskin‚Äù peels off them quickly, which makes the edges sharp), however, like most ears from the kits to the devices.  Oh yeah, a trifle, but pleasant - the headphones are in white color. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ec7/233/3b9/ec72333b9743603e20091932d664a5ac.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Check weighing </h3><br>  <u><b>pros</b></u> <br>  - Good equipment - case, adapters, nozzles; <br>  - A separate item cover; <br>  - Built-in microphone; <br>  - Great sound; <br>  - Wires practically are not tied in knots. <br><br>  <u><b>Minuses</b></u> <br>  - Not yet detected. <br><br><h3>  Total </h3><br>  Total we have unexpectedly appeared high-quality headphones at an adequate price (1000-1500 rubles), which will suit both unpretentious gamers (PC and portable set-top boxes), and fans to listen to music from the player.  As a pleasant moment, I would like to note that the material from which the braid of the wires is made does not allow the headphones to curl, so even after the most severe cataclysms they can be unraveled by simply rubbing it up on weight. <br>  I don‚Äôt have any complaints about the sound quality, the appearance, the package bundle, or even the length of the wires - only positive emotions, I am terribly pleased.  And the cover was just a find) Now this is my constant companion. <br><br>  If you meet - take it.  Not for yourself, as a worthy universal gift will always fit. <br><br>  By the way, about naming.  <b>Moray</b> from foreign is translated as <b>moray eel</b> .  Curious naturalists <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B">tossing</a> another article from Wikipedia) Oh, and they are terrible!  ) <br>  <b>Successes!</b> <br><br>  <b>PS</b> I noticed on the site of the riser another announcement - the mobile mouse <b><a href="http://www.razer.ru/product/mouses/orochi/">Razer Orochi</a></b> , which seems to me sooo interesting.  But to find it nowhere else fails - as soon as, so immediately read the review </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/67534/">https://habr.com/ru/post/67534/</a></p>
