There were mostly technological reports, but there were no evangelists and sponsorship reports.  I really liked the organization of the event, except for the absence of sockets in the hall and a long queue for badges on the first day.

      <a href="http://2012.front-trends.com/">Conference site</a> , of.  the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/">#FrontTrends</a> , as well as the organizers promised to post videos of the presentations soon (as the information appears, I will definitely update the post). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  First day schedule: </h2><br>  The links slides reports and sites of speakers, below my brief notes on the presentations, as well as reports can be read at the <a href="http://2012.front-trends.com/speakers/">office.</a>  <a href="http://2012.front-trends.com/speakers/">page</a> (eng) <br><br><h3>  WEB: PLATFORM OR PILE 'O HACKS? </h3><br>  <a href="http://infrequently.org/">Alex Russel</a> <br><br>  Alex talked about the future of web applications, and the possible vector of technology development - why wait while implementing some CSS property when we can invent our own?  Perhaps in the future, we will have access to low-level browser technologies, and we will be able to write our own standards with blackjack and divas. <br><br><h3>  RESPONSIVE REDESIGN: SMASHING MAGAZINE'S CASE-STUDY </h3><br>  <a href="http://smashingmagazine.com/">Vitaly friedman</a> <br><br>  Vitaly told about the history of portal redesigns, and how they came to a new responsive design.  The main problems of the old design, he noted - the clutter of the interface, poor typography, speed.  These problems led to the fact that ~ 40% of users began to view content from the site only through readers and RSS feeds. <br><br><h4>  A couple of abstracts </h4><br><ul><li>  It would seem that Smashing Magazine is a design site, and the percentage of visitors with XP is ~ 16% </li><li>  One of the goals of the new design was to limit 45-90 lines of text on any resolution. </li><li>  Boilerplate, modernizr, respond.js - under the hood of a new design </li><li>  By removing Facebook's buttons, the number of likes of articles has increased (it‚Äôs not clear how, but the author suggested that thanks to the new design, people began to share links and impressions more often) </li><li>  The maximum step for media queries on the site is 2000+ px </li></ul><br><br><h3>  <a href="http://speakerdeck.com/u/chriscoyier/p/what-we-dont-know">WHAT WE DON'T KNOW</a> </h3><br>  <a href="http://css-tricks.com/">Chris Coyier</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f9a/5b8/fdc/f9a5b8fdcd343be4fc4a75f5ceb1ec27.png"><br><br>  Basically, Chris retold the latest articles from css-tricks.com - talked about small web services that simplify life for developers ( <a href="http://caniuse.com/">caniuse.com</a> , <a href="http://css3please.com/">css3please</a> , etc.), about different polyfiles, for backward compatibility of new technologies in old browsers, and In short, about preprocessors. <br><br><h3>  <a href="http://desandro.github.com/mobile-safari-machete/">MOBILE SAFARI: BRING YOUR MACHETE</a> <br></h3><br>  <a href="http://desandro.com/">David Desandro</a> <br><br>  From the interesting, I can only note the property -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch, which allows scrolling on the web, as in native iOS applications.  It was also interesting to hear about the features of touch events in iOS applications (see the slides).  Otherwise, quite well-known problems with the viewport width, support position: fixed, etc. were affected. <br><br><h3>  <a href="http://speakerdeck.com/u/rmurphey/p/beyond-the-dom-sane-structure-for-js-apps">PATTERNS FOR ORGANIZING NON-TRIVIAL JAVASCRIPT APPLICATIONS</a> </h3><br>  <a href="http://rmurphey.com/">Rebecca murphey</a> <br><br><h3>  <a href="http://speakerdeck.com/u/csswizardry/p/breaking-good-habits-1/">BREAKING GOOD HABITS</a> </h3><br>  <a href="http://csswizardry.com/">Harry Roberts</a> <br><br>  Gary talked about independent blocks and approaches in the layout, allowing to make the design easier to expand and easier to maintain.  Avoid fixed widths, use abstract class names, think in blocks, not pages. <br><br><h3>  HTML5, INTERNET EXPLORER AND WINDOWS 8 - THE MICROSOFT STORY </h3><br>  <a href="http://microsoft.com/">Daniel Biesiada</a> <br><br>  The only interesting news from the evangelist from Microsoft - IE10 will be available for Windows 7. <br><br><h3>  <a href="http://speakerdeck.com/u/jina/p/style-guide-driven-ui-design-with-sass">STYLE GUIDE-DRIVEN UI DESIGN WITH SASS</a> </h3><br>  <a href="http://sushiandrobots.com/">Jina bolton</a> <br><br>  Gina talked about the usefulness of the style-guides, gave examples of the style-guides that were open on the network (she especially praised the <a href="http://developer.android.com/design/index.html">style-guide for the Android application interfaces</a> ), links to which can be found in the presentation slides. <br><br>  By the end of the report, Gina talked a little about the possibilities of SASS and preprocessors in general. <br><br><h3>  <a href="http://www.v3ga.net/conferences/ft2012/">MIND THE GAP</a> </h3><br>  <a href="http://v3ga.net/">Julien gachadoat</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c11/13c/564/c1113c564ce654012ed1eda10599806d.jpg"><br><br>  Julien began with the presentation of one of <a href="http://www.v3ga.net/conferences/ft2012/">his projects</a> , created for offline installation, projected on the wall of a building.  After that, he continued with stories about interesting JS libraries that allow him to create unusual things using web technologies, and also revealed the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãone of his upcoming projects. <br><br><h3>  <a href="http://speakerdeck.com/u/getify/p/html5-javascript-on-crack-v3">HTML5 JAVASCRIPT ON CRACK</a> </h3><br>  <a href="http://getify.com/">Kyle simpson</a> <br><br>  Kyle talked about his experiment, where he tried to use all the most delicious features of HTML5, the <a href="http://github.com/getify/wepuzzleit">source code is attached</a> . <br><br><h4>  <a href="http://lea.verou.me/css-4d/">CSS IN THE 4TH DIMENSION: NOT YOUR DADDY'S CSS ANIMATIONS</a> </h4><br>  <a href="http://lea.verou.me/">Lea Verou</a> ( <a href="">6 megabyte thematic picture</a> ) <br><br>  In the report, Leah discovered a couple of interesting features of the css transitions and animations, in the presentation you can find live examples.  If you are interested in css3 animations, be <s>sure to read</s> through the slides. <br><br>  For me, it was a discovery to make a delay on the transition not on launch, but <a href="http://dabblet.com/gist/2623169">only on return</a> . <br><br><h3>  <a href="http://www.braniecki.net/b2g/">THE WEB IS THE PLATFORM ‚Äî MOZILLA'S MOBILE OS</a> </h3><br>  <a href="http://diary.braniecki.net/">Zbigniew Braniecki</a> <br><br>  This was one of the non-technology reports, where an evangelist from Mozilla talked about the potential of their new product and called for an open web.  In the report, he mentioned that they are now working with other browser vendors, and maybe soon we will see the fruits of their joint collaboration. <br><br><h3>  <a href="http://www.medikoo.com/future-web/">FUTURE OF WEB APPLICATIONS, WHERE CLIENT DOESN'T NEED SERVER</a> </h3><br>  <a href="https://twitter.com/">Mariusz Nowak</a> <br><br><h2>  Schedule of the second day: </h2><br><br><h3>  <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/szafranek/javascript-refactoring">REFACTORING JAVASCRIPT - BIG BANG THEORY?</a> </h3><br>  <a href="http://szafranek.net/">Krzysztof Szafranek</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1c6/df2/e91/1c6df2e918d706d63ef2eea1769ed6da.png"><br><br><h4>  A couple of abstracts </h4><br><ul><li>  Get rid of the code deferred for the future, in 99% of cases, you will not need this code. </li><li>  Code refactoring is an investment in the future. </li><li>  If the method contains more than 10 lines of code, it needs to be refactored. </li></ul><br><br><h3>  <a href="http://taligarsiel.com/Projects/howbrowserswork1.htm">HOW BROWSERS WORK INTERNALLY</a> </h3><br>  <a href="http://taligarsiel.com/">Tali garsiel</a> <br><br>  Basically, Rachel retold her (already quite old) article - <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/internals/howbrowserswork/">HOW BROWSERS WORK: BEHIND THE SCENES OF MODERN WEB BROWSERS</a> . <br><h4>  From notes </h4><br><ul><li>  Browser handling of markup errors makes HTML difficult to parse. </li><li>  Blocks with z-index are postponed and drawn after all the others. </li><li>  The most unpleasant thing about working with browser sources is a very long compilation of the code (1 hour example) </li></ul><br><br><h3>  <a href="http://blog.lassus.se/files/javascript_the_subsets_we_use.pdf">JAVASCRIPT: THE SUBSETS WE USE</a> </h3><br>  <a href="http://lassus.se/">Olov lassus</a> <br><br><h3>  <a href="http://speakerdeck.com/u/rachelandrew/p/pushing-the-boundaries-without-breaking-the-web">PUSHING THE BOUNDARIES WITHOUT BREAKING THE WEB</a> </h3><br>  <a href="http://rachelandrew.co.uk/">Rachel andrew</a> <br><br>  Rachel's report was a kind of opposition to Chris Royer's report, in which she rejected Chris's idea of ‚Äã‚Äãusing polyfiles and third-party libraries as much as possible.  She urged not to shove a bunch of scripts into the project right away, to solve possible problems, but to solve problems as they appeared, studying specific cases and the need for polyfiles. <br><br>  It seems to me that Rachel spoke in a very accessible way about the problems of polyfiles, as well as in performance, and in limiting the development of developers.  As the video recording of the report will be posted, I strongly advise you to listen to it. <br><h4>  The main theses of the report </h4><br><ul><li>  "This is the amazing time to be a web developer." </li><li>  ‚ÄúThe web is a work in progress.  Your job?  To deal with it. ‚Äù </li><li>  "Teach problem solving before polyfiling." </li><li>  "We‚Äôve been learning, learning and contributing." </li></ul><br><br><h3>  10 THINGS I DIDN'T KNOW ABIT HTML </h3><br>  <a href="http://mathiasbynens.be/">Mathias Bynens</a> <br><br>  Matthias retold the latest articles from his blog, mainly about the need for quotes in HTML / CSS and about invalid characters in the names of the Java Script variables. <br><br><h3>  <a href="http://nimbu.in/front-trends/">DESIGNING IN THE BROWSER</a> </h3><br>  <a href="http://nimbupani.com/">Divya manian</a> <br><br>  A participant in the CSS Working Group, and now an engineer at Adobe, spoke about the advantages of prototyping design right in the browser, citing as an example the tools to simplify this approach to design development. <br><br>  If you also think about prototyping in the browser, it will be useful for you to listen to another report from Ya.Subbotnika - <a href="http://narod.ru/disk/15582739001/Vadim_Pacev_-_CSS_v_rukah_designera.mov.html">CSS3 in the hands of the designer</a> ( <a href="http://download.yandex.ru/company/experience/subbotnik/Pacev_Kiev.pdf">slides</a> ). <br><br><h3>  ALICE.JS: A LIGHTWEIGHT INDEPENDENT CSS ENGINE </h3><br>  <a href="http://blackberry.com/">Luca Sale</a> <br><br>  Luke, an evangelist from Blackberry, talked about the <a href="http://blackberry.github.com/Alice/">Alice.js</a> library, which allows you to easily animate elements on CSS without bothering with the prefixes and specifics of CSS animations.  The library showed examples of work on the Blackberry Playbook (the entire application worked smoothly, without brakes), urging everyone to switch to web technologies, in game and application development. <br><br><h3>  SAME FLASH DIFFERENT CODE </h3><br>  <a href="http://nclud.com/">Alex Giron</a> <br><br><h3>  <a href="http://speakerdeck.com/u/theophani/p/design-processes-not-interfaces">DESIGN PROCESSES, NOT INTERFACES</a> </h3><br>  <a href="http://tif.ca/">Tiffany conroy</a> <br><br><h3>  <a href="http://speakerdeck.com/u/bartoszopka/p/learning-to-teach">LEARNING TO TEACH</a> </h3><br>  <a href="http://bartaz.github.com/">Bartosz szopka</a> <br><br>  Bartosh urged not to hide his code from other developers and share more experience with the younger generation of developers - if performance is not critical for you, do not minify the code (JS, you can work with HTML and CSS via webkit inspector / firebug), or give links in the comments to working version of files. <br><br><h3>  <a href="http://jsno.de/presentations/Front-Trends/">WHEN TO NODE?</a> </h3><br>  <a href="http://jfsiii.org/">John schulz</a> <br><br><h2>  Links to reviews from other conference participants </h2><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://csswizardry.com/2012/04/front-trends-2012/">csswizardry.com/2012/04/front-trends-2012</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.rachelandrew.co.uk/archives/2012/05/01/front-trends-2012/">www.rachelandrew.co.uk/archives/2012/05/01/front-trends-2012</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://dev.end3r.com/2012/04/after-the-front-trends-2012-conference/">dev.end3r.com/2012/04/after-the-front-trends-2012-conference</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://tjrus.com/blog/front-trends-2012">tjrus.com/blog/front-trends-2012</a> </li></ul><br><br>  And some photos <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/csswizardry/sets/72157629558792354/">www.flickr.com/photos/csswizardry/sets/72157629558792354</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rachelandrew/sets/72157629925736779/">www.flickr.com/photos/rachelandrew/sets/72157629925736779</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/%3Fset%3Da.3473800521945.2141030.1179125846%26type%3D3%26l%3Dbe69989dac">www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.3473800521945.2141030.1179125846&amp;type=3&amp;l=be69989dac</a> </li></ul><br><br><h3>  PainStation </h3><br>  In the intervals between the reports, it was possible to play <a href="http://painstation.de/">PainStation</a> , as well as a bicycle was played at the end among the winners. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/AmFPURsKKh8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiKpVpkClMRsHQUBUCjHsVYISKjfw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h3>  About the conference venue </h3><br>  We arrived in Warsaw a day earlier, we were pleasantly surprised by the good weather, at the time when we had +10/12, in Poland the summer was +20/32. <br>  After the 2nd World War, the city was destroyed, and all the buildings, mostly new, but left a small old town, and cozy pedestrian streets.  In general, in Warsaw, I didn‚Äôt have much to be bored, many interesting places, many people on the streets. <br><br>  WiFi was practically in all establishments, with the English people there were no particular problems with the local population, Polish is also quite understandable, especially for Ukrainians.  The English menu in all institutions is common, prices are also very pleasant, slightly cheaper than in Riga, and much cheaper than in St. Petersburg and Moscow :) <br><br>  The conference was held on Thursday and Friday, we decided to stay for the weekend to visit Krakow.  If you are going to go to Front Trends, be sure to try to leave time to visit Krakow!  Very good atmosphere, beautiful old town.  Krakow is like a little Prague. <br><br><h3>  PS </h3><br>  In the near future I plan to be on St. Petersburg web standards, maybe even at <a href="http://environmentsforhumans.com/2012/css-summit/">CSSSummit</a> and <a href="http://fronteers.nl/congres">Fronteers</a> , so stay tuned! <br><br><h3>  UPD </h3><br>  Front-trends have released a couple of official conference videos. <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/42227345&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgyxZCVUgGYVtK0Ow-1SGrimU927g" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="Front-Trends 2012 reel" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/42219816&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhh01lM71vDquD2nLiParuJIsKj1gw" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="Front-Trends 2012 highlights" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h3>  UPD 10/23/12 </h3><br>  The organizers of the Front-Trends gradually spread <a href="http://vimeo.com/user9986068/videos">records of reports</a> from the conference.  And judging by this <a href="https://twitter.com/varjs/status/259325832584122368">tweet</a> , in 2013 there will be a more epic event, be sure to go! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143382/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143382/</a></p>
