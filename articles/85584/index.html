  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Yandex Tour</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In order not to feel like a full kettle and get more information from the excursion, I decided to first read a few words about the company.  I learned that Yandex stands for "yet another indexer", but in general there are a lot of options for explaining the name.  She also found a report on the interview, in which the employees were presented not from the best side (as it turned out, this information was not confirmed, and everyone who communicated with us was quite friendly and friendly).  After that, the impression of the company was a bit spoiled, so it was just necessary to see it with my own eyes! <br><br>  The tour was supposed to start at 13:30, and, oddly enough, there were no latecomers.  The office is located in the business center "Benoit", to which there are free buses on a strict schedule.  Therefore, it is not surprising that everyone found themselves in the same bus and had a pleasant conversation to the center. <br><br>  In the business center, the first surprise (as ITMO students should have been) was a canteen with a huge queue.  After an employee of the company (Nikolai Malevanny) came down behind us and gave us one-time passes, we went up to the 4th floor, which Yandex occupies, on an elevator with a glass wall (this was the second bright impression).

      <br>
    <a name="habracut"></a>  Opposite the elevator is a snow-white counter with a huge company logo.  The beginning seems to be a good one. <br>  Passing along the corridor, we saw the same snow-white walls with multi-colored transparent doors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/339/65f/7ef/33965f7ef9505e86a7a53134b596e923.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e12/ddb/4c8/e12ddb4c8bbebae34af1d364e73e8764.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Each meeting room has its own name - the origin of which remained a mystery to us (Winter, Summer, Smolny ...).  Instead of offices - offices by the type of domain names (office.414, office.430). <br><br>  We were led to the video conference room. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/017/e0e/51a/017e0e51ab545c6958129f8af5148961.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Employees, who were supposed to tell something, began to pull themselves into it.  Separately, it should be mentioned that we were the first experience of organizing excursions for students, so not only did we look at everything in the zoo, but they also looked at us in a similar way). <br><br>  After the introductory words, the representative of Yandex.Market began to speak, who briefly explained the main task of the department: ‚ÄúIf a person is looking for a product, he should go not to Google, but to Yandex‚Äù.  A bold statement, see if they get it.  He then said that the stores often seek to plant grandparents for laptops, who will post positive reviews from different IP addresses, and a little about how they ring up troubled stores where goods are displayed at the wrong prices are reported inaccurate information about the availability of goods and etc., and the difficulty of categorizing products such as covers for cameras or mobile phones, that is, those that are difficult to choose according to parameters such as the manufacturer, etc. <br><br>  The next was a representative of the fair sex (Ekaterina Gorenchuk), responsible for testing and internships.  She told about manual and automatic testing, how to get to their department and what options they can offer students.  It was noted that testing can be the user part (interface), functional (through the interface), internal and billing (in Yandex.Market, the relationship score bought / clicked). <br><br>  When it came time for questions, inxaoc clarified ‚ÄúDo girls in the department do everything according to the instructions?‚Äù, To which the answer was received that there are no detailed technical tasks, there is only a final task, the solution of which everyone determines himself. <br><br>  A representative of the Quality Search department began his story with interesting requests and user sessions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2c6/1e2/844/2c61e2844fcaf05467e31e1c2f8f2ba9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1c3/87f/036/1c387f036f96bebcfa8156046ab40ee5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Then I switched to a bad search, in which duplicated information (copy-paste of the same source) or unilateral (a favorite example is a jaguar) information or ‚Äústale‚Äù output is displayed.  In the course of their work, the employees of the Quality Search department track frequent requests and the reason for their appearance, which are usually easily explained.  However, there are cases when it is quite difficult to explain the user's behavior (for example, a request about a doctor who is not a homeopathic person who interested people because of the publication of such a question in a free newspaper crossword).  We were also told that when he came to work at Yandex, he found out everything about Dom-2 and Katya Lel, and the request ‚Äúteacher‚Äù can only be with one subtext. <br><br>  A couple of words were also said about the developers: for example, each of them has three favorite queries, after successfully completing which, they consider their search engine to work perfectly, which is not always true.  Yandex monitors its users by analyzing their sessions, thanks to which three of the most frequent questions became known: VKontakte, Odnoklassniki and XXX.  There are several versions about the popularity of the first two: someone is lazy to drive in an address, older users may not even know about the existence of the address bar, and one 13-year-old girl who spends all her free time on VK is just too lazy to switch the language (most likely, she‚Äôs not the only one). <br><br>  A representative of the Yandex.Avto department finished this stage of the tour, told about how he wrote the site collecting information about cars from 7 sites, how Yandex bought his project and invited him to work (now Auto collect information from 248 sites, taking into account the relevance and duplication of information, displaying statistics on the views of this model, along with others, and showing a chart of prices).  They are engaged in the extraction of semistructured data using modern technologies (here they gave advice to learn mathematics). <br><br>  The next stage was a direct tour of the company with brief information about the individual rooms (in one, for example, employees were found playing table tennis).  In addition to bright colored transparent doors and walls, funny signs and signs were unusual. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b81/078/fd3/b81078fd31425ab0f7eea795187bfada.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d04/a0d/6b9/d04a0d6b98000c7c68e472969dc91def.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/564/a64/814/564a648144f9b6ed9d5babbd4a0c51a7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fed/f4b/756/fedf4b756768efd905edc2db0a02e463.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  So we got to the dining room, in which there was an opportunity to talk with interested staff.  The dining room is decorated in the style of the company and offices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/97e/2f9/bf6/97e2f9bf63dd69bf912a09b1e12bbbcd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  and mentally divided into two parts: Yandex.Money, located on the same floor for some reason, are separated from Yandex, and only a person who has enough karma can come to their table with food. <br><br>  During tea drinking, it was possible to get answers to questions of interest, for example, to find out that the School of Data Analysis in St. Petersburg will not be organized yet, and in their spare time, developers out of habit use all search engines. <br><br>  The remaining questions were asked after returning to the videoconferencing room, where a common photo was taken: <br><br><img src="http://cs281.vkontakte.ru/u337069/9382833/x_f8c9a586.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Impressions of the sea excursion, mostly positive.  I was a little upset by the fact that there was no 20% rule and great difficulty in promoting my ideas within the company. <br><br>  In any case, thanks to Yandex for letting me in and interestingly told, inxaoc for organizing the tour, Klio and the readysteady blogger for the photos! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/85584/">https://habr.com/ru/post/85584/</a></p>
