Here, for example, a new speaker with a difficult name SRS BTV5. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ebe/d2d/41e/ebed2d41ebd05dfec76a5da5f20e4ee7.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      <b>Appearance and ergonomics</b> <br><br>  The column looks very impressive and downright cosmic - a matte ball with a cut-off bottom and two wide openings in the upper part, through which a silver speaker is visible.  It is made of soft plastic with soft touch coating and is available in two versions - black and white.  The controls represented by the three round buttons do not protrude from the surface of the ball and are almost invisible.  At the bottom there is a three-position switch, by holding which in the extreme right position you can turn the column on or off, the middle position is required for setting up the wireless connection and creating a pair, and the left one is for turning off NFC in order to save some charge.  Charges the device through the included micro-USB cable from a standard charger, or from a fairly powerful port.  One charge lasts about 5 hours of continuous operation.  The kit also includes a small mesh case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/779/f23/d56/779f23d560428a7a51deaac609751928.jpg"><br><br>  The connection is made via Bluetooth, to install, just touch the NFC icon on the top of the speaker with a phone that supports this technology, we checked with Xperia Acro S and Xperia Z1, as well as with a pair of devices from other manufacturers - everything was determined the first time and worked perfectly.  If the phone does not have an NFC or the device is not determined for any annoying reason - you can always find it in the Bluetooth settings and create a pair.  To do this, you will need to move the lower switch to the pairing position.  Well, if you are an ideological opponent of wireless connections or you want to use a speaker, for example, with a player - under the plug there is a usual 3.5 mm mini jack connector.  Although, in our opinion, the main point of this column is precisely in the absence of wires.  The sound is confidently transmitted at a distance of up to 10 meters, but if you move a little further, interruptions begin.  For a couple of rooms, however, this is quite enough, so listening to music stored on a computer in the kitchen is no problem.  This column is also an excellent choice for home parties - you can leave it in the center of the party, and carry a phone with music with you so that no one attempts to play a specially prepared playlist. <br><br>  <b>Sound</b> <br><br>  As for the sound, in fact, for such a compact speaker system it is really good - fairly clean, without overloading and any distortion, even at maximum volume.  Even the bass is present (as far as possible, of course), but the volume limit is not that great, although it is quite enough for decent hearing in a large room.  A little interrupted by the interruption of sound and squeak when you change the volume, but this can get used to.  Output power is 1.2 watts.  360 Circle Sound technology lies in the pyramidal protrusion, the top of which is directed to the center of the speaker, which allows you to disperse the sound in all directions and make it more legible and surround.  Since there is only one speaker, it is recommended to turn on the mono-compatibility mode in the player, otherwise the sounds widely spread over the panorama may disappear or sound too quiet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5ec/60c/cf2/5ec60ccf2820d24e0325c21c07579c58.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ce5/edf/b32/ce5edfb32fe3a3b395629af0932bcbfb.jpg"><br><br>  A very interesting detail is the built-in microphone.  If someone suddenly called you, you do not have to go into your pocket or go to the other end of the room for a smartphone - just press the answer button and talk directly through the column, which, in this case, works just like any wireless headset, well and the music at the time of the conversation is muffled by the phone itself. <br><br>  <b>Summary</b> <br><br>  Stylish and compact speaker with a very decent, for such dimensions, sound, a number of interesting features, good autonomy, the lack of wires and the ability to use them if desired or necessary. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/207592/">https://habr.com/ru/post/207592/</a></p>
