After three months of vain attempts to find a name for a new business, he set his partner an ultimatum: ‚ÄúI will call Apple if you don‚Äôt offer the best by 5 o'clock‚Äù.

When Sabir Bhatia appeared with the business plan for this service, he went through all the words ending in ‚Äúmail‚Äù and eventually settled on hotmail, since the name contained the letters HTML (markup language of web pages). <br><br>  <strong>Hyundai</strong> - in Korean "present" (time). <br><br>  <strong>IBM</strong> - International Business Machines. <br><br>  <strong>Intel</strong> - Bob Noyce (Bob Noyce) and Gordon Moore (Gordon Moore) wanted to name the company Moore Noyce, but by that time there was already a hotel chain with this name.

In Japanese consisted of 8 letters (lucky number in Japan). <br><br>  <strong>Xerox</strong> - Inventor Chestor Carlson (Chestor Carlson), wanted to reflect in the title the word ‚Äúdry‚Äù (since at that time there was only a wet copy).  ‚ÄúXer‚Äù is dry in Greek. <br><br>  <strong>Yahoo</strong> - the word coined by Jonathan Swift (Jonathan Swift) in the book ‚ÄúGulliver's Travels‚Äù.  So called repulsive, disgusting person.  The founders of ‚ÄúYahoo!‚Äù Jerry Yang and David Filo chose this name because they called themselves yahoo'mi.
