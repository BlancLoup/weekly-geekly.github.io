  <section class="page js-page"><h1>This music will live forever</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day! <br><br>  I want to talk a little about music, what is it for us?  - For adolescents, this is a whole cult, for some it is just a background, for someone a way to come off in the dance.  Music even represents whole countries in the form of hymns.  Music is a part of our life. <br>  It can be different - a lot of styles, trends and genres, but I want to talk about such a course as a soundtrack, or rather the soundtrack to the game.  Of course, I didn‚Äôt play at all games, to be honest - I‚Äôm not playing much lately, which is why my post will cover only what I heard and what made a powerful impression on me. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I work as a programmer with designer elements, but also in my free time (if I‚Äôm not busy with anything) - I participate in various <s>freelancing</s> projects.  What does it matter?  - And almost the most direct - I love working with music, and that's what I highlight among others (let me remind you, I‚Äôm talking about the soundtracks from the games, so the radio, and various groups are not counted), my top 3: <br><br>  1) It all started back in 1997, I was still in school, and we, like everyone, had happy owners of a personal computer exchanging disks with toys, as a rule, these were pirated collections.  Then there was another program called ‚ÄúFrom the Screw!‚Äù - I saw a review of the second part of my favorite Quake - I stopped and was upset - the computer would not pull.  And after a month or two, a friend offered me a Q2 disc - the English version - ‚Äúlet's not play it, they don't even start with me‚Äù.  I started it, but at the minimum settings.  I played it for several hours a day, then my ‚Äúsitting in front of the computer before 3 am‚Äù started - I became a fan.  And when I learned that you can play "on the network" ... But this is another story :-) <br>  I found that the music in the game is just super.  I recorded it on a player (tape) and listened to the subway.  The music that I listen to to this day.  I still love it and it is included in my ‚Äúgolden collection‚Äù, the author of music is the great Sonic Mayhem.  Quake 2 - number 1 of my soundtracks!

      2) The Cold War, the USSR vs. the USA is an eternal topic, there are millions of games for this scenario, of different genres.  But one of them is loved by me since childhood, when there were no World In Conflict and other modern hits yet.  I'm talking about Red Alert (game of 1996)!  I passed it along and across and realized - yes!  that's cool!  Of course, I preferred the Soviet troops.  The soundtrack there is just a fairy tale, from the great and terrible - Frank Klepacki (Frank Klepacki), when the immortal hit Hell March is playing - as much as the blood freezes in his veins!  Surely heard?  - Here I listen to this day. <br><br>  3) I don‚Äôt really like racing, driving around the track for a while - dismiss it!  I am personally bored.  In addition, when I was a gamer, there were no such beautiful games as the last parts of the NSF or TestDrive (I saw screenshots recently, and I thought why there was no such thing before!).  But one game I still liked, not that the race, but the cars were there, and people had to be crushed to add a few sweet seconds - everyone already guessed it - Carmageddon (but only 1 piece!).  He was very fond of his time, he played for hours on end, you know - he delays :-) And the music!  Mmm ... I love!  This is an instrumental album from Fear Factory.  Powerful industrial. <br><br>  So, my TOP: <br>  1) Quake 2 <br>  2) Red Alert <br>  3) Carmageddon <br>  These hits will be forever recorded in my player <br><img src="http://pic.ipicture.ru/uploads/081001/2xBeVNPIEu.jpg"><br><br>  I talked about my personal top 3, but I can not help but mention such powerful soundtracks as: <br>  Brothers Mario (damn, this is the gamer's old school anthem).  Music from the once very popular Neverhood quest is also good, albeit an amateur one.  The Destruction Derby destroying thrash racing sound also deserves respect.  Their last track is Max Payne.  StarCraft, Diablo, Silent Hill - there were some good tracks.  And many, many others, I do not take individual compositions in games, I consider - the entire sound of the game - so that it can be poured onto the player and enjoyed on the way, or work under it, as I do (although I repeat: I listen to the radio too ).  As you saw, I considered old toys, but time-tested, music that has been around for a dozen years with me. <br><br>  I hope you enjoyed my post.  I hope that you smiled and said: ‚ÄúYes, I remember - something cool was playing there,‚Äù I hope you have a good nostalgia.  And I ask you, dear habraklyudi - if not difficult - share with me what kind of music from computer games you like. <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> Thanks to everyone who expressed his opinion and shared his top, found a lot of interesting music, which he had never heard of before.  Thank! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/41405/">https://habr.com/ru/post/41405/</a></p>
