  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Interview with a twelve-year game developer + author</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The DevGamm gaming conference this year gathered a record number of participants (over a thousand three hundred), some of whom have already published their impressions.  However, among the developers and publishers of games, Vadim was a little different, primarily because he was 12 years old. <br><br>  Vadim made the game <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.vgi.RobotsInc">Robots Inc</a> with an unusual voice control.  (In order for the robot to fly, you need to buzz, and in order for a bomb to explode at the end of the level, you need to say: ‚ÄúByd!‚Äù) At gaming conferences, you rarely meet 12-year-old mobile game developers, so we decided to interview Vadim. <br><br>  Vadim is studying in a Moscow school with the in-depth study of foreign languages ‚Äã‚ÄãNo. 1296 in 6 in the classroom.  He has been working with Unity since 2011, in 2012 he completed a course on C #, and now he studies Java on his own.  Also actively engaged in karate.

It was a lot of fun, and I thought it would be nice to control the character myself.  I began to look for how to make the game myself.  And after a while I came across Unity3D.  After that, I went through a basic C # programming course and started using it in Unity3D.  Unfortunately, and perhaps fortunately, I had to learn a lot from video or text lessons. <br><br>  - <b>Where did you study?</b>  <b>At school?</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúIn our school, at the computer science class, we make slides for a PowerPoint presentation ‚Äî nothing more.  And I was actually studying in the center of additional classes Unium. <br><br>  - <b>Do you have any favorite computer games?</b>  <b>Whose idea was it to be trained in programming?</b> <br><br>  - Unfortunately, there is almost no time for games.  I play them only for understanding what people like now.  Favorite game, perhaps, I can call Final Fantasy.  As for learning, I told my parents about my programming interests, and, fortunately, we didn‚Äôt live very far from Unium and knew that there were C # classes there.  I was recorded there, and soon I began to study. <br><br>  - <b>Tell me how you made the game.</b>  <b>What was the hardest thing?</b> <br><br>  - First, I had an idea about a game with voice control;  it seemed to me that it would be very unusual.  I started working on character and paper levels.  Then dad and I created the levels and character in the form of three-dimensional models and poured them into Unity.  And it began a long, but this is not at all a boring programming process.  Making games is fun and almost straightforward.  I think the most difficult thing is to come up with an idea that people will like. <br><br>  - <b>And how did you get an idea with voice control?</b> <br><br>  - This idea appeared during a 5-day brainstorming session.  She came quite spontaneously, and we didn‚Äôt even expect to be able to come up with something so unusual and new. <br><br>  - <b>Why did you make the game just for Google Play?</b>  <b>Do you plan to do something for iOS?</b> <br><br>  - Yes, I plan to make a version for iOS, but so far there is no equipment for compiling - an Apple computer. <br><br>  - <b>What do you plan to do next with the game?</b>  <b>Are you planning to make money on it?</b> <br><br>  - While I'm finalizing it, polishing it and going to make more new levels. <br><br>  - <b>Do you have any other projects besides the game?</b> <br><br>  - Besides Robots Inc, I have a mini social network project.  All communication takes place in the three-dimensional model of my school, which is filled with textures created from photographs.  While this project is not ready, but it gives great hope and has a large field for development.  You can follow him on the site <a href="http://1296-online.ru/">http://1296-online.ru/</a> . <br><br>  - <b>I see.</b>  <b>And where is the communication?</b>  <b>How do you see what the site visitors will do on this project?</b> <br><br>  - Communication takes place in the general chat, but there is an opportunity to send a private message. <br><br>  - <b>Do your friends share your passion for programming?</b> <br><br>  - My friends often act as testers of my games.  They are interested in my occupation, they support me, but they themselves are not addicted to programming. <br><br>  - <b>Is your dad related to programming?</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúMy dad is not engaged in programming, but he helps me to create three-dimensional models in Blender. <br><br>  - <b>Last question about programming.</b>  <b>Did you participate in any programming competitions or contests?</b>  <b>Know about these?</b> <br>  - I have not participated in contests or competitions yet, but I really want to.  We have a project competition at school, but the teachers are not saying anything yet. <br><br>  - <b>Now about the DevGamm conference.</b>  <b>How did you find out about her, how long did you have to ask your parents to participate?</b> <br><br>  - I learned about DevGamm from a video on YouTube, told my parents, asked to go to it - they suddenly agreed, bought tickets for DevGamm and on a plane.  It was very unexpected, but I was glad. <br><br>  - <b>How do you like the conference?</b>  <b>What did you like and what did you not?</b> <br><br>  - The conference was just super.  I liked the communication with experienced developers and publishers, but almost all the reports were very superficial, and I already knew about the technologies being told. <br><br>  - <b>And what reports did you visit?</b> <br><br>  - I visited most of all reports. <br><br>  - <b>Some of them went in parallel.</b>  <b>Have you been to the big hall?</b> <br><br>  - For the most part, I listened to the reports in the ‚ÄúVenice‚Äù hall - that is average. <br><br>  - <b>I see.</b>  <b>What report is remembered more than others?</b> <br><br>  - Most of all I remembered the report of Yakub Dvorsky, actually because of Yakub himself. <br><br>  - <b>:)</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8e2/739/af7/8e2739af79604c7040814b8a395c8318.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Vadim with Yakub Dvorsky.</i> <br><br>  - <b>And which of the publishers and developers did you manage to communicate with?</b> <br><br>  - I talked to publishers from G5 and developers from KamaGames and other small companies. <br><br>  - <b>And what agreed?</b> <br><br>  - Agreed on my job in the company on weekends at KamaGames.  [In KamaGames, employment did not work out (due to difficulties related to the lack of a passport and intellectual property issues), but they promised to help and support everything.  - Approx.  Vadim's father received later] <br><br>  - <b>At DevGamm there was <a href="http://devgamm.com/kyiv2013/games/">a game contest</a> .</b>  <b>What games did you vote for?</b>  <b>What are you like?</b> <br><br>  - I liked the game Parallel Levels.  For her and voted. <br><br>  - <b>I plan to publish an interview with you on Habrahabr.</b>  <b>This is a site for programmers and developers.</b>  <b>You can ask them any technical questions and ask for advice if you want.</b> <br><br>  - I have long been familiar with Habrahabr, and they have already answered all my questions. <br><br>  - <b>Cool, and what is your nickname?</b> <br><br>  - I am not registered there (I am going to do this), but I often read posts there. <br><br>  - <b>I see.</b>  <b>The last question is who do you want to be when you grow up, and who are you targeting now, who is an example for you?</b> <br><br>  - I have not yet decided on a profession, but I know for sure that it will be related to programming.  An example for me is Gabe Newell. <br><br>  It should be noted that Vadim made the game for the month.  I think he will be grateful for links to programming contests and tips for further improving his game.  It also seems to us that Vadim is a walking advertisement for Unity (a twelve-year-old boy developed the game on Unity for a month and published it on Google Play!). <br><br>  <b>UPD: Vadim with us, you can ask questions:</b> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/vadosik/" class="user_link">vadosik</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/206528/">https://habr.com/ru/post/206528/</a></p>
