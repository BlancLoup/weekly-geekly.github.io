We are glad to see the efforts of our colleagues who supply even video information to the blog, but we decided to approach the issue from the other side, i.e.  in the form of a classic digest.  I would like to hear comments, suggestions, and also, what the hell is not joking, praise :) So far, you can only post in a personal blog, so we apologize for the temporary inconvenience. <br><br>  So let's get started ... <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      <b>Reducing staff at Maxis Studios</b> <br><br>  Publisher Electronic Arts has officially confirmed that Maxis studio staff has been reduced.  How many developers sent to the free bread is not reported.  According to representatives of EA, the reason is completely out of money.  This is a common situation in the gaming industry, when the studio expands and decreases, it all depends on the current market situation.  There will be no changes in Maxis project releases.  Exit Spore Hero for Wii and Spore Hero Arena for DS is not postponed for a day and will take place on October 9. <br><br>  Recall that in the spring of this year Maxis was left by its founder and legendary game designer Will Wright.  He went to the company Stupid Fun Club, which he himself founded in 2001, where he is engaged in producing websites and television shows. <br><br>  <b>Raven Software: the impact of the crisis was ‚Äúdemolished‚Äù by some</b> <br><br>  Studio Raven Software, located under the wing of the publisher Activision, announced the dismissal of 35-40 of its employees - office workers in Wisconsin (USA).  The reasons for the layoffs are not called, but it is curious that statements about personnel changes were made almost immediately after the release of the Wolfenstein shooter on August 18, 2009. <br><br>  Now the studio continues to work on the sci-fi shooter Singularity, the release of which is delayed.  Whether this is due to the economic crisis, which clearly hurt the company - is not known. <br><br>  <b>Reason for closing FASA Studio</b> <br><br>  In September 2007, if you still remember, FASA Studio was closed, which released MechWarrior 4: Vengeance, Mechcommander and Shadowrun.  Only today, the former head of the studio, Jordan Weisman, revealed the reason for the closure. <br><br>  He says that in fact, FASA Studio died back in 1999, when Microsoft bought it.  Even then, she began to crumble in her eyes.  Jordan claims that Microsoft acquired FASA for the reason that the latter, firstly, was the owner of a popular franchise, and secondly, she made very strong projects and had her own ‚Äúculture‚Äù of game development.  And all this immediately began to crumble.  Actually, the last brick collapsed in 2007. <br><br>  Jordan Weisman is currently working for Smith and Tinker, or rather, is the head of the studio.  Together with the guys from Piranha Games they make a new MechWarrior, the preview on which we covered on our website.  Together with MechWarrior, the company‚Äôs rights to intellectual property such as Shadowrun and Crimson Skies, inherited from FASA, are in the company's bedside table. <br><br>  <b>Turbine has entangled Atari in litigation</b> <br><br>  In the gaming industry, there are two great ways to get rich: make an amazing game and drag someone to court.  And you can, without losing time, create a game and immediately start with someone to sue her. <br><br>  Today, for example, it became known that the Massachusetts (USA) studio Turbine sued the publisher Atari.  Do not share the MMO game Dungeons &amp; Dragons Online and the issue price is very high - $ 30 million. <br><br>  The situation was as follows: Turbine studio developed Dungeons &amp; Dragons Online, the publisher was Atari, which has exclusive rights to the Dungeons &amp; Dragons series. <br><br>  According to the plaintiff, the publisher is trying to get rid of the previously concluded agreement on post-sales support of the project in favor of another own development, which it is going to launch.  The studios have to independently support the project at their own expense, which is contrary to the contract and greatly offends Turbine‚Äôs management. <br><br>  As compensation, developers want to get 30 million green rubles. <br><br>  <b>Splash Damage simultaneously announced Brink 2 and 3</b> <br><br>  British studio Splash Damage announced at the same time the second and third parts of the Brink shooter. <br>  The announcement is surprising already because the first part of the shooter has not yet come out.  Its release is scheduled for 2010.  Perhaps the developers are very confident in their abilities. <br>  The first part of the shooter Splash Damage announced in May, it will be the first independent project of the studio.  Prior to this, Splash Damage worked only under the wing of other, larger companies. <br><br>  <b>Final Fantasy XIII: Release Date Set in USA</b> <br><br>  The latest "last endless fantasy" Final Fantasy XIII has found the exact release date in North America.  A significant event for fans of the series will be held June 21, 2010.  In Japan, as always, everything is much more optimistic: the game will go to the store shelves already this year, that is, more than half a year earlier. <br><br>  Online shop Gamestop is already sending Americans a pre-order, which will cost $ 59.99.  Releases of the Xbox- and PS3-versions of the game will take place simultaneously and will cost the same. <br><br>  We also want to bring to your attention our journalism: <br><br>  <a href="http://gamestar.ru/article/1186.html"><b>Diablo 3. About the monk and not only</b></a> <br><br>  Blizzard is still betting on characters with frankly magical skills.  The monk is a warrior of light and a wonderful fighter against the undead.  Has a rather charismatic appearance and a lot of interesting and unusual abilities. <br><br>  <a href="http://gamestar.ru/article/1163.html"><b>The announcement is just around the corner.</b></a>  <a href="http://gamestar.ru/article/1163.html"><b>Part 1. (GTA 5, Doom 4, Fallout 4, Dead Space 2, etc.)</b></a> <br><br>  Today we want to tell you about the sequels that are in work, but there is actually no information about them.  Their full-fledged announcement, as the name implies, is not far off, but it‚Äôs not clear where these mountains and what the future of famous titles is. <br><br>  <a href="http://gamestar.ru/article/1166.html"><b>The announcement is just around the corner.</b></a>  <a href="http://gamestar.ru/article/1166.html"><b>Part 2. (Fable 3, HL 2: Episode 3, Hitman 5, Thief 4, etc.)</b></a> <br><br>  Having gone through memory, news archives and various interviews, we selected another pack of interesting projects in our opinion.  Below you will find out who is creating the Syndicate remake, when Agent 47 returns, what the ninth part of Mortal Kombat will be, and much more. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/68324/">https://habr.com/ru/post/68324/</a></p>
