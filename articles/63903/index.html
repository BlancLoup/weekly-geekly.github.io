And that the place was bicycle-friendly, without traffic jams and with clean air. <br><br>  The country was chosen by science.  We wrote for ourselves the criteria, estimates, made a tablet in Excel.  Unfortunately, the sign with the time somewhere lost.  Estimated from his experience.  Had time to live a little in France, England, States.  Traveled to work a couple dozen countries. <br><br>  In the end, chose New Zealand. <a name="habracut"></a>  True, it was the only country whose evaluations in Excel were taken from hearsay, and not from my own experience.  As a result, it turned out that all the estimates were set almost correctly.

      New Zealand is among the countries with a fairly transparent system of obtaining a residence permit, with points (along with Canada, Australia and the UK at the time).  Moreover, the timing of the review was less than in Canada and Australia.  Especially if there is a job offer.  The personal attitude of the immigration officer and current policies affect the timing rather than the outcome.  The result is affected only by strict adherence to published rules.  If there are discrepancies in the rules, they were decided in our favor, after a direct request.  Running a little ahead, I note that in Germany a lot depends on the decision of the official involved in your business.  He has much more rights to resolve issues on his own.  We are lucky so far. <br><br>  Here it was just in time for the work that I communicated with the employees of a small but well-known <a href="http://www.endace.com/">company</a> in certain circles, who said that they were growing rapidly and were looking for engineers in this regard, including abroad.  (By the way, they are still growing and hiring, although they became even more picky because of the crisis. Most of all they want seemingly experienced VHDL designers) I flew in for an interview (hint: the easiest way to get a limited visa for this purpose ) <br>  The office was very happy with the person who was ready to come with a slight demotion, the salary was offered the same as he had earned in St. Petersburg.  After all the expenses, according to my estimates, should have remained the same.  About the way it happened.  They helped get a work visa quickly, they helped with the move.  We immediately applied for a residence permit upon arrival.  Less than a year later he received it. <br><br>  Now, according to rumors, the immigration department is trying to hold work visas.  Crisis got. <br><br>  A year and a half has worked in this wonderful company.  The work was not difficult, the people around are pleasant, from all over the world.  My wife and I went to the mountains and the ocean for the weekend, there was a lot of time for self-education and our small projects.  But digging into one product was a bit tired, and I began to study the local labor market.  By the way, I received an offer from Germany.  Work is much more interesting, much more money.  I was lucky with time - I would still be in a week, and the frozen labor market would not give any chances. <br><br>  Now there is no time for their projects, and in general, after work, it pulls to rest.  You still have to learn German, and live far from the ocean.  But the whole of Europe is near, delicious bread is sold everywhere (there are problems with this in the NC), pastries, sausages and beer. <br><br>  Another difference is that in NZ we didn‚Äôt come across officials and we didn‚Äôt personally communicate at all.  There are officials in Germany here, and they prefer to communicate with people personally on many issues.  We must come to them, wait in line, and speak German.  Or try.  In English, they can speak, but do not like;) <br><br>  In New Zealand, we will certainly return.  When we are 60 years old, or when a UFO will begin to exterminate humanity.  It depends on what happens before.  With the invasion of aliens, they will not recall New Zealand at once.  Well, on vacation, of course.  For one and a half year we traveled only 80% of the northern island.  Be sure to look at the south. <br><br>  P.S.  By the way, I can't help but promote my new old <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/blogs/author/alexander-komarov/">work blog</a> on the Intel Software Network. <br><br>  ZZY  So far, the rules of the New Zealand Immigration Organization have not disappeared from my head, I am ready to answer questions if anyone is interested. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/63903/">https://habr.com/ru/post/63903/</a></p>
