  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Scripts in .NET / Mono by means of the platform itself</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  Introduction </h4><br>  Working here on one project, it took me that the project's functionality would expand on the fly and third-party developers, with the possibilities for expansion being as much as possible, with the possibility of editing the code on the fly.  Accordingly, the plugins for this were not very suitable because of the need for their constant recompilation after any changes.  Exit: scripts.  Before that, I worked with scripts a long time ago and it was Lua in C ++.  A good option, if not for a few drawbacks: <br><ul><li>  The lack of a normal implementation or a layer under .NET / Mono - in all that I saw there were some flaws (maybe I was looking badly - at least I missed Lua in TaoFramework) </li><li>  Apparently, it was necessary to write a bunch of bindings so that the .NET / Mono runtime environment could interact normally with the Lua environment and back. </li></ul><br>  It was then that I wondered - maybe there is something in .NET / Mono to implement the scripts?  And the answer was yes.  The namespace " <i>System.CodeDom.Compiler</i> " was just what I needed - the ability to implement scripts that maximally connected to the .NET / Mono environment. <a name="habracut"></a>  True, if you look at my scripting mechanism from the inside, then it turns out and not even scripts, but the code written in C # is simply dynamically compiled and loaded into memory for execution.  However, despite even such a "fake", I achieved the result - I could edit the code, recompiling it right on the fly in my application.  And at the same time it will work even on machines where Visual Studio and other development tools are not installed, since compilers, at least, C # and VB.NET go straight along with .NET and Mono. <br>  An example, which is discussed in the article, you can download here: <a href="">http://zebraxxl.programist.ru/ScriptsInDotNet.zip</a> <br><br><h4>  Namespace " <i>System.CodeDom.Compiler</i> " </h4><br>  Actually the most important thing in this article.  It is here that classes are assembled for compiling code in a .NET / Mono assembly.  The main class performing the work is the <i>CodeDomProvider</i> class.  In essence, this is an interface above the compiler, which simply prepares the data for compilation and calls the compiler of the selected language with the necessary parameters.  Well, let's start in order. <br><br><h4>  And what languages ‚Äã‚Äãdo we support at all? </h4><br>  To figure this out, just call the static method <i>CodeDomProvider.GetAllCompilerInfo</i> .  This method will return a <i>CompilerInfo</i> array.  In theory, of course, it may be that a single compiler supports several languages ‚Äã‚Äãat once, but in practice I haven‚Äôt met this yet.  But just in case of ‚Äúmultilingualism‚Äù of the compiler in .NET / Mono, it is done in such a way that first we get information about individual compilers, and only then we see who supports which language.  Here are examples of the output of this information from the example: <br><pre> <code class="hljs swift"><span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0</span></span> compiler languages: <span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">c</span></span># cs csharp <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span> compiler languages: vb vbs visualbasic vbscript <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">2</span></span> compiler languages: js jscript javascript <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">3</span></span> compiler languages: vj# vjs vjsharp <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">4</span></span> compiler languages: <span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">c</span></span>++ mc cpp</code> </pre><br>  As can be seen here - in fact, I have 5 languages ‚Äã‚Äãat my disposal: C #, VB.NET, J #, JScript, C ++.  The same conclusion shows that each compiler serves one language. <br>  Here you can also add that on other computers (without Visual Studio installed - my friend's machine, which has nothing to do with IT and my Ubuntu server is 11.04, Mono from the repository (2.6.7)) produces the same result. <br>  And what does the support of many languages ‚Äã‚Äãgive us?  And it gives us the fact that we will be able to write scripts in various languages ‚Äã‚Äãand at the same time without thinking about their processing them in the application.  And this in turn increases the level of entry of third-party developers.

    <h4>  And now she is!  Compilation </h4><br>  Well, now try to compile something.  Let's write some test class in C #.  It can be found in the file "TestScript.cs".  The class itself is fairly simple - just two methods.  One is static, the other is not.  Both simply output text to the console and return a string.  Also in static one parameter is transferred. <br>  To start compiling we need to get something to compile.  To do this, run the static method " <i>CodeDomProvider.CreateProvider</i> ".  As a parameter, it takes the name of the language in which we compile.  We received the names in the previous step. <br>  The next step is to fill in the compilation parameters.  All parameters are stored in the " <i>CompilerParameters</i> " class.  The most interesting fields: <br><ul><li>  <i>CompilerOptions</i> - additional parameters to the compiler (i.e. what will be passed, for example, csc in the case of C #) </li><li>  <i>GenerateExecutable</i> - generate an assembly in an executable file.  In general, in fact, it will be done in any case.  Only if this field is false - the executable file will be generated in a temporary folder.  And if true - then it will be where the " <i>OutputAssembly</i> " field will say </li><li>  <i>GenerateInMemory</i> - generate assembly in memory.  Again, in fact, first the assembly will be in the executable file from where it will be loaded. </li><li>  <i>IncludeDebugInformation</i> is a very useful field.  If you write true here, the debug information will be generated and you can debug the scripts directly in parallel with the main application. </li><li>  <i>ReferencedAssemblies</i> - which builds to use when compiling.  Also the right field.  In my project, I wrote down the name of the main application here so that the scripts have access to its structure and can fully integrate with the application. </li></ul><br>  Well, now everything is simple - we <i>call CodeDomProvider.CompileAssemblyFrom *</i> depending on where we get the source.  There are three options: <br><ul><li>  <i>CompileAssemblyFromFile</i> - from a file.  The last parameter is a list of file names to compile. </li><li>  <i>CompileAssemblyFromSource</i> - from strings.  It is understood that we have already read the source files and they are stored in the array of strings in the last parameter </li><li>  <i>CompileAssemblyFromDom</i> - from the DOM source tree.  Something like DOM for an html (or xml) document </li></ul><br>  The first parameter in all these methods is the " <i>CompilerParameters</i> " parameters.  As a result, we get " <i>CompilerResults</i> ".  From here you can get all the information about how the compilation went.  The most interesting and necessary fields " <i>CompilerResults</i> ": <br><ul><li>  <i>CompiledAssembly</i> - the resulting assembly loaded into memory (if the GenerateInMemory field was set </li><li>  <i>Errors</i> - errors and warnings issued by the compiler </li></ul><br>  So, if <i>CompiledAssembly is</i> not null (that is, the build was compiled successfully), then there we can already use our script as a fully-fledged .NET / Mono build, accessing the functions and fields we need via reflection.  I will not dwell on this part in more detail - after all, this is another topic. <br><br><h4>  Are the scripts simpler? </h4><br>  It is certainly good to use such a powerful language as scripts - it opens up tremendous opportunities for expanding the functionality of the application, but in some cases it can be a nailing microscope.  The difference in the two variants of the complexity of the code is obvious: <br><pre> <code class="cs hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">using</span></span> System; <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">namespace</span></span> <span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-title">Script</span></span> { <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span></span> <span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-title">Script</span></span> { <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"> </span><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">static</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"> </span><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">void</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"> </span><span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">M</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function">(</span><span class="hljs-params"></span><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params"></span>)</span></span> { Console.WriteLine(‚ÄúHello world‚Äù); } } }</code> </pre><br>  Or this option: <br><pre> <code class="cs hljs">WriteLine(‚ÄúHello World‚Äù);</code> </pre><br>  Two codes that, in principle, do the same thing (provided that in the second version, <i>WriteLine</i> is meant as a call to <i>System.Console.WriteLine</i> ) - but as they say: "Feel the difference." <br>  There are many ways to achieve this simplification.  And each of them will have its own advantages and disadvantages.  However, they will all be reduced to one thing: to the dynamic generation of a ‚Äúbig‚Äù code from a ‚Äúsmall‚Äù one.  For example, I took the easiest way to come up with: <br><ol><li>  I created a separate class (hereinafter the implementation class) which contains all the methods that are global in the scripts (in the example, the <i>MiniScriptWorker</i> class). </li><li>  Created a template for generating ‚Äúlarge‚Äù code - one child class of the implementation class with one empty method (file ‚ÄúScriptTemplate.cs‚Äù) </li><li>  The ‚Äúsmall‚Äù code is simply inserted into the implementation of that empty method of the template class (the ‚ÄúMiniScript.cs‚Äù file) </li></ol><br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  It is in this simple way that we get powerful enough scripts practically free of charge in the .NET / Mono application without having to pull additional dependencies.  Yes - in some cases, this method will probably even be redundant, but everything still depends on the task - in my case, this implementation was the best and most convenient. <br>  Once again about the advantages of this method: as scripts you will have a powerful language with almost complete access to the .NET / Mono environment (it‚Äôs up to you to decide which builds will be available during compilation during compilation).  Also, simply by adding your application to the list of assemblies for the script, you will get almost complete integration with your application and the ability to modify it the way you, or the developer of the script, want. <br>  However, from this grow and cons.  Sometimes it may be necessary to hide some piece of the main application from the script.  It can be protected from this by hiding such parts in the scope of " <i>internal</i> ".  True, this protection can be circumvented with another problem ‚Äî security suffers because of such wide access to the .NET / Mono environment.  For example, we can not prevent anything using <i>System.IO.FileStream</i> to open any file with passwords and then quietly send its contents somewhere in the wrong hands.  Unfortunately, I do not have a solution to this problem yet - I did not have time to sort the issue in more detail. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/119355/">https://habr.com/ru/post/119355/</a></p>
