Here are some of them. <br><br>  <b>1.</b> Series, as a rule, are short, lasting for 20-30 minutes.  This is convenient when you need to work out the series several times.

      <b>2.</b> Series, looking, of course, what, are deprived of a special mental load.  You can safely immerse yourself in identifying new words and phrases, without really thinking about the essence of what is happening. <br><br>  <b>3.</b> In the serials, again, mostly a lot of colloquial, slang speech.  This is useful for those who have the goal of pumping spoken language. <br><br>  <b>4.</b> In the serials speech is live, as close as possible to the usual speech of native speakers.  “As close as possible” because I make allowances for the fact that the actors have the right diction and excellent pronunciation of words, it is quite easy to understand them, but when talking to some native speakers, it is not always clear what they are saying. <br><br>  <b>5.</b> I do not know how for you, but for me this is a plus.  Some American TV shows are really fun to watch.  Understanding jokes for me is the motivation to continue to look and understand further. <br><br><h2>  Here are some guidelines for watching TV shows: </h2><br>  If you have difficulty in reading fast in English, and in general you don’t feel very confident when watching something in English, then you should start watching TV shows with RUSSIAN subtitles.  Yes, I understand, the way is so-so, but for the entrance and acclimatization it will be fine.  Using this method it will be easier for you to understand and identify unfamiliar words, of which there will be at the very beginning, a lot. <br><br>  Next, go to the option to view with English subtitles.  Plus the fact that you are not only listening to English, but also reading.  But on this option, too, it is not necessary to sit long. <br><br>  Further, of course, view without any subtitles.  You will already learn by ear to identify unfamiliar words and try to understand the essence of what has been said already from the context of HEARED, and not read.  What is more useful for listening comprehension than just reading and listening. <br><br><h2>  Here is my way of watching TV shows. </h2><br>  I first watch a series with English subtitles, translate words that are incomprehensible to me, and then I add them to the dictionary.  Next, I watch a series WITHOUT subtitles, check if I understand everything and see how comfortable I am, write out favorite phrases and try to pronounce them as much as the actors do.  I remember that I liked so much Joey's catchphrase from the series “Friends”, “How are you doing?” That I worked on the guy who was staring at me in the hall while I was doing a squat.  I said it with the same intonation as Joey.  The guy did not understand the humor, apparently, as the phrase, but no longer stared. <br><br>  Of course, all the phrases that you learn should be used in a real conversation with native speakers (how to find the nativs, I described <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/286508/">here</a> ).  For if you don't lose it. <br><br><h2>  Actually, here is the list of TV shows that, in my opinion, are pleasant and useful to watch. </h2><br><br>  <b>1.</b> Of course “Friends”.  I will not move away from the classics.  Yes.  Friends as the start of watching TV shows in English is a very good option.  This series is good because the dialogues are very simple, the speech of the actors is clear, not very fast, the words are also quite simple.  In general, the series is funny, it is pleasant to watch.  It is quite easy to find on the Internet. <br><br>  → <a href="http://fenglish.ru/serial-friends-druzya-na-anglijskom-yazyke-s-subtitrami/">fenglish.ru/serial-friends-druzya-na-anglijskom-yazyke-s-subtitrami</a> <br><br>  2. After watching “Friends” on a wave of excitement, I started watching the series “Joey”.  Yes Yes.  About this fabulous idiot they shot a whole series, but not for long, just 2 seasons of 20 episodes each.  The series is not as funny and pleasant as Friends, but it is not bad for studying the dialogues. <br><br>  → <a href="http://fenglish.ru/serial-joey-dzhoui-na-anglijskom-yazyke-s-subtitrami-eng-subtitles/">fenglish.ru/serial-joey-dzhoui-na-anglijskom-yazyke-s-subtitrami-eng-subtitles</a> <br><br>  <b>3.</b> Next, I decided to go up a notch.  I started watching the Seinfeld series.  The series is great!  No stupid humor, funny jokes.  BUT!  Speech fluent, specific jokes, it was quite difficult to understand that in the first series. <br><br>  → <a href="https://show-english.com/serial/seinfeld">show-english.com/serial/seinfeld</a> <br><br>  <b>4.</b> “How I met your mother” is also a pretty good show.  Good jokes are not enough, but again, for practicing words and phrases will go. <br><br>  → <a href="http://fenglish.ru/how-i-met-your-mother-kak-ya-vstretil-vashu-mamu-na-anglijskom-s-subtitrami/">fenglish.ru/how-i-met-your-mother-kak-ya-vstretil-vashu-mamu-na-anglijskom-s-subtitrami</a> <br><br>  <b>5.</b> “Lie to me” with Tim Roth is quite good.  The series is replete with various specific terms.  Speech is fast.  Many words from the list of recommended words for putting the TOEFL.  Watch it is interesting and not just for the sake of TOEFL. <br><br>  → <a href="https://show-english.com/serial/lie-to-me">show-english.com/serial/lie-to-me</a> <br><br>  <b>6.</b> Pure British English lovers will love the “Downton Abbey” series.  Pure British speech, full of phrasal verbs and idioms. <br><br>  → <a href="https://show-english.com/serial/downton-abbey">show-english.com/serial/downton-abbey</a> <br><br>  <b>7.</b> “King of the hill” can't ignore this American animated series.  He is so simple and cool that it is captivating.  I think many of you will like the hard worker Hank, the morons Dale and Beal, and what a challenge it will be to understand Bumhauer's speech. <br><br>  → <a href="http://kingofthehill.fox-fan.ru/season.php%3Fid%3D1">kingofthehill.fox-fan.ru/season.php?id=1</a> <br><br>  <b>8.</b> "The Simpsons" also will not pass by.  There is nothing to comment on.  Just watch. <br><br>  → <a href="https://show-english.com/serial/the-simpsons">show-english.com/serial/the-simpsons</a> <br><br>  <b>9.</b> “Futurama” there too. <br><br>  → <a href="https://show-english.com/serial/futurama">show-english.com/serial/futurama</a> <br><br>  <b>10.</b> “South park!” Yes!  Lovers of mat and vulgar humor, hardcore and thrash to watch necessarily. <br><br>  → <a href="https://show-english.com/serial/south-park">show-english.com/serial/south-park</a> <br><br>  <b>11.</b> Poirot, Agatha Christie - still for me a low-rise challenge.  For words and phrases are rather difficult to understand, in addition, Poirot himself speaks with a French accent, which at times complicates the understanding of what he says.  The downside is that by not understanding one word, you can miss the whole essence of the said sentence, and since, personally for me, there are a lot of incomprehensible words, almost nothing is completely realistic to understand.  It is necessary to rewind the same sentence many times and analyze its meaning. <br><br>  → <a href="https://static-rbx3.ororo.tv/ru/shows/poirot">static-rbx3.ororo.tv/en/shows/poirot</a> <br><br>  <b>12.</b> A little better in this regard, the series "Murder she wrote".  Although the series itself is quite complex in terms of understanding speech, word complexity and language turns, but everyone speaks pure, academic English and no French accent. <br><br>  → <a href="https://static-rbx3.ororo.tv/en/shows/murder-she-wrote">static-rbx3.ororo.tv/en/shows/murder-she-wrote</a> <br><br>  You can not be attached to this list, but watch other thematic series.  The level of all of the above TV shows is about the same.  The conversation is the same, only in some TV shows language turns are more difficult and jokes are harder to understand, such as in the Seinfeld series, and in some TV shows, such as in friends, it is easier.  Personally, I recommend watching comedies for learning English, since they are the hardest to understand. <br><br>  If you know a TV series that looks like a Sinefield, please write in the comments, I will look with pleasure. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/403143/">https://habr.com/ru/post/403143/</a></p>
