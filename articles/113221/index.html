  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Wishlist instead of can-do and to-do lists</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently on Habr√© I read about <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/gtd/113083/">can-do lists</a> <font color="#808080">(as an improved version of to-do lists)</font> .  I liked the idea that ‚Äúit is necessary‚Äù is a very lousy motivation, because I know for myself that it will either turn me into a robot or into a lazy one, protesting against any imposition.  But these lists are still not free from negative motivation.  Looking at the wording of the can-do list, the feeling that these same bitter pills are ‚Äúnecessary‚Äù only in a soluble sweet shell does not leave me.  Firstly, there is a semantic blurring: ‚ÄúI can‚Äù means both abilities <font color="#808080">(can)</font> and probability <font color="#808080">(may)</font> , and fuzzy meaning gives rise to the suspicion that I‚Äôm trying to outwit myself somewhere.  Secondly, setting goals with the formulation ‚ÄúI can‚Äù reminds of the game ‚ÄúWeak?‚Äù, I.e.  assumes that I will grit my teeth to achieve this result only to prove to myself that I could: aim for the sake of the goal, overcome for the sake of overcome, work without consideration, but what for I do it at all.  And at the end of the day, looking at the untrodden "can", I feel an unpleasant aftertaste and disbelief in my abilities, which will be the impetus for this list to be abandoned. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="http://i16.fastpic.ru/big/2011/0203/ab/a434b7aa3a12796bc03ada468b4b7eab.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I remembered that in my life I had projects that I did with gusto, forgetting to sleep / eat and run to the toilet, I didn‚Äôt have to push, kick and motivate: they were interesting in themselves, and even if stage was clean and boring routine, it was still easy and in one breath, because I was literally looking forward to the sweet fruits of intermediate and final results, and pleasure from other stages of work.  And I also remember that when I made the difficult decision to abandon something imposed <font color="#808080">(albeit by myself and not by other people)</font> , an incredible relief came.  Of course, it was possible to keep weak and reluctant targets on the lists, transfer them to the end, rewrite from day to day, postpone for a week, month, transfer to the archive and gradually throw it out, but still they could not be considered initially.

      So, according to the results of observations there are 2 types of actions: <br>  ‚Ä¢ which are certainly accomplished easily, efficiently and naturally: doing what is pleasant <font color="#808080">(in parts and as a whole)</font> , <br>  ‚Ä¢ and a deliberate refusal <font color="#808080">(that is, not forced, not when I confront myself that I don‚Äôt do shit while things to do)</font> from unpleasant actions. <br><br>  And what about an attractive result <font color="#808080">(fee for work)</font> and unattractive stages <font color="#808080">(lazily doing everything)</font> ?  In which case, this work will be done without negative motivation, without any ‚Äúnecessary‚Äù and ‚Äúdo or die of hunger‚Äù <font color="#808080">(because the subconscious mind will surely whisper: ‚Äúit is better to die than to rape yourself‚Äù - and as a result: laziness, self-rape, short a surge of satisfaction from the completed work, and a wild joyless fatigue)</font> ?  Obviously: if the advantages of the result will prevail over the minuses of the intermediate routine. <br><br>  1. To begin with we make a bunch of planned cases, no ratings, nothing.  Just a to-do list. <br>  2. Then we take from the heap of planned affairs any one you like. <br>  3. We put him a point of attractiveness <font color="#808080">(based on our own scale of attractiveness, where the maximum score - say ‚Äú10‚Äù - is put to the most desired one that you have ever wanted)</font> . <br>  4. We write this business with a rating in a notebook. <br>  5. To understand what prevents him from doing it quickly - we paint subtasks with our attractiveness points <font color="#808080">(we estimate unattractiveness with a minus sign)</font> . <br>  6. Add estimates of subtasks and add an assessment of the desirability of the result. <br>  7. If plus - then there is motivation.  If minus - throw in the trash. <br><br>  After such sorting, the basket of planned cases remains essentially a wishlist, which you can implement even now.  If nothing remains, it means either a day off, when you just take a rest from everything, or a reason to think, and what are you doing in this particular place at this time? <br><br><img src="http://i16.fastpic.ru/big/2011/0203/f5/e2d45e096a00c250e0fe7c7d286c39f5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  When you start to implement the case, it is advisable to make periodic pauses and re-evaluate the attractiveness of the remaining subtasks and the result.  If everything goes well, then it will be possible to see how the overall attractiveness of the goal grows, and it becomes easier and easier for you to strive for it - a real acceleration occurs. <br><br>  As a result, the subconscious <font color="#808080">(in this case: an unconscious desire for something desired or a protest against senseless self-coercion)</font> realizes that for some reason they begin to listen to his voice, and go out on stage instead of any ‚ÄúNeed‚Äù and ‚ÄúIs it weak?‚Äù the player ‚ÄúI want‚Äù, who will be able to move mountains, pass through walls and take any situation into his own hands. <br><br>  <font color="#808080">- Offtop.</font>  <font color="#808080">I noticed that I like to use long explanations in brackets, and this makes it difficult to look at the whole sentence, and the general meaning is blurred accordingly.</font>  <font color="#808080">I tried to make brackets more faded to highlight the main sentence.</font>  <font color="#808080">Ideally, you want them to be collapsed, and turn around or pop up with a hint when you hit the mouse, then the text will look more compact and easier to grasp in the first approximation.</font> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/113221/">https://habr.com/ru/post/113221/</a></p>
