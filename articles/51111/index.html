This story is about how to effectively develop a product from a management point of view.  Let today's post be partly advertising, but I still think will lead to thinking about the problems and possible solutions to the issue of effective product development. <br><br>  And So Today, I would like to tell you a little about the new training.  He reveals the secrets of managing software products in the face of constant change.  ;). <br><br>  Recently I received a call from a large software company.  After the introduction of Scrum in the company began conflicts.  The manager complained that the developers began to challenge management decisions on the development of a particular fitch in the iteration.  <b>It turned out that the transition to iterative and incremental development simply exacerbated the existing problems!</b>  Management sets tasks that are not needed from a business point of view.  :( <br>  Development blames management for inadequacy.  Management, in turn, blames the development of improper performance.  Lost the time of the team and company money.  And we want to earn a product :)!

      Have you often worked in Agile projects, where the overall goal of the iteration is not quite clear ?!  In a project that has Backlog, but people who are involved in product development do not understand the purpose of the release.  As it turned out, this happens in many companies, both in small and in companies with multimillion-dollar budgets.  The fact is that many of the phrase ‚ÄúEnd of iteration = complete and working product‚Äù is understood as writing the ‚Äúideal‚Äù stable code by the end of the iteration, forgetting about the true business objectives of the product. <br>  I would like us not to make such mistakes. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Each project should have an understanding of what and for whom the product is being developed.  For this, a Product Concept or Product Vision is created.  Product Vision is a document describing the path that a product should develop from a business point of view, conveying the meaning of development to the entire project team.  The concept should be clear and communicated to everyone from the Product Owner and Team to customers and all interested parties.  <b>Having a properly formulated Product Vision is</b> one of the <b>components of the project‚Äôs success.</b> <br><br>  In our super-training :) one of the topics that we will look at in detail will be the writing of Product Vision. <br>  We will talk about how to write it so that this document would be useful and effective in the project. <br>  We will try to learn first and foremost to think about the project from a business point of view. <br><br>  This completely new training, we have never, during the existence of the company, immersed you in the peculiarities of the work of food teams in Agile and are ready to share secrets :).  The training will be interesting to those who are somehow connected with the management of software projects. <br><br>  We are waiting for all those who love the product being developed :). <br><br>  Theses of the training can be found <a href="http://scrumtrek.ru/content/view/16/37/">here.</a> <br>  Sign up for training, you can <a href="http://scrumtrek.ru/component/option,com_eventlist/Itemid,32/func,details/did,7/">here.</a> <br><br>  I will lead him, Nikita Filippov. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/51111/">https://habr.com/ru/post/51111/</a></p>
