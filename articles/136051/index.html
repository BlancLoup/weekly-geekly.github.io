In the presence of a beautiful ADC chip. <br>  She already had no carrying handles, so only the legs were gilded. <br>  It was necessary for the golden-footed beauty to be unleashed from the dangers of the outside world, whose role in this tale was played by a monster in the form of a temperature converter.  And it really was a monster - big, black, constantly fed by alien energy directly from the network. <br>  A pacifying resistor was connected to the output of the transducer, which transferred the nerve currents to a more gentle voltage.

      I'm not an electronics engineer, I'm just learning.  But for the sake of those I love, I am capable of any miracles. <br>  Began to read about the ways of the outcome. <br>  Isolation is when two circuits are connected, but without electrical contact. <br>  The most common methods are transformer and optical. <br>  But these are not our methods - no intrigue! <br>  He began to think ... <br><br>  Temperature data is very rarely needed. <br>  An idea appeared - what if we used a matchmaker in the form of a relay? <br>  No sooner said than done! <br>  Applied two RES-55 relays.  Of course, it is desirable to use only one relay with two pairs of switching contacts, but this was not found - at that time there were no electronic stores, and the police were driving enthusiasts. <br><br>  The scheme can not draw - I will explain in words. <br>  The capacitor is connected to the switching contacts of the relay - one and two. <br>  While the voltage on the relay coils is not applied, the switching contacts are connected to the constantly closed contacts of the relay.  Closed contacts are connected to a temperature converter monster. <br>  As a result, we have that the capacitor is constantly charged to a voltage proportional to temperature. <br><br>  When the ruler of the world, the electronic circuit, wanted to know how things were with temperature, a short pulse was sent to the relay coils and the capacitor safely flowed over to other contacts, where he was met by a beauty.  The meetings were short - after giving up some of their energy, the condenser was a little weaker returning to the base, where he reached the condition and no one disturbed him until the next flight. <br><br>  An easy task was to limit the meeting time, during which the readings of the temperature sensor without distortion appeared at the ADC output. <br>  It was also necessary at the right time to start the beginning of the ADC, after the relay contacts stop shaking from a counterstrike. <br><br>  If you look at the horizontally located <a href="https://docs.google.com/open%3Fid%3D0B38yPPb71lGRNDIzMGM5OTctZjg5My00NDVkLTllYmMtOTkzMDE0YWE2Mjc5"><b>scheme</b></a> , then our hero will be in the upper left corner. <br>  The switching contacts of the relay resemble wings that ‚Äúflap‚Äù when a capacitor is in flight. <br>  As it should be in aviation, to improve aerodynamic characteristics, a beautiful streamlined body was used, filled with compound. <br><br>  According to the passport, the relay resource is as many as two million operations for such meetings.  According to calculations, this was enough for several years of work. <br>  Life is fully confirmed.  Less than 18 years later, the old automation boards were replaced with more modern systems. <br><br>  So the ‚ÄúFlying Capacitor‚Äù was implemented with in-flight refueling. <br>  And a fairy tale was born about beauty, love and the beast. <br>  And I got what I wanted - a denouement. <br><br>  <b>PS The</b> flying capacitor on the effect of Bifeld-Brown is not related to this project. <br><br>  Habrohronika. <br>  1. <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/DIY/135806/">Lamp time.</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/136051/">https://habr.com/ru/post/136051/</a></p>
