    </font> <h4>  What is paid content? </h4><br>  In order for you, my friend, to understand what kind of content is involved, we will clearly define what we further understand by paid content, it is nothing more than: <br><ul><li>  Games ( <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D1%2583%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D1%258B">casual games</a> , popular games, online games) </li><li>  Music </li><li>  Video </li><li>  Programs </li><li>  Audiobooks </li></ul>  That is the entertainment content that is in demand and for which the user is willing to pay to get it.  As well as the content that is now sold on DVD discs. <br><br><h4>  What have we got? </h4><br>  <b>1. Age of content buyers</b> <br><br><img height="289" width="481" src="http://team.enaza.ru/upload/medialibrary/d24/vozrast.PNG" alt="vozrast.PNG" title="vozrast.PNG"><br><br>  75% of paid content buyers are no longer students or schoolchildren, they are solvent network users.  And at least <b>50% of buyers are the older generation, more than 25 years</b> .  It is also interesting that 10% of purchases are still made by adults for over 40 years. <br><br>  <b>2. The presence of a plastic card from buyers.</b> <br><br><img height="289" width="481" title="visa_card.PNG" alt="visa_card.PNG" src="http://team.enaza.ru/upload/medialibrary/e67/visa_card.PNG"><br><br>  Important information to understand that the potential buyer has the opportunity to pay for the content.  More than <b>55% of users have plastic cards</b> , respectively, can pay for content almost instantly when the need arises.  They do not need to run to replenish the account with Yandex Money or Webmoney, pay for the order in the payment terminals or replenish the account on the mobile phone to pay by SMS. <br><br>  <b>3. Email availability.</b> <br><br><img height="289" width="481" title="email_use.PNG" alt="email_use.PNG" src="http://team.enaza.ru/upload/medialibrary/0c3/email_use.PNG"><br><br>  <b>90% of buyers use e-mail</b> - therefore, this method of communication with the buyer is the most effective.  Weekly newsletters and notifications of special offers work very well, but the user should be given an opportunity to control the notifications and mailings he receives. <br><br>  <b>4. Are you ready to buy paid content?</b> <br><br><img height="289" width="481" title="content.PNG" alt="content.PNG" src="http://team.enaza.ru/upload/medialibrary/5e3/content.PNG"><br><br>  Definitely YES, <b>56% are ready to buy paid content</b> , if its quality is guaranteed better than that of a pirate with cracks or NO DVD.  At the same time, 20% of users are used to buying discs, but again they are happy that they are ‚Äúwilling to pay‚Äù in this way, they will gradually move to the group ‚ÄúI‚Äôll rather download high-quality content - but for a fee.‚Äù <br><br>  <b>5. Is the description of the Content on the site important?</b> <br><br><img height="289" width="481" title="opisanie.PNG" alt="opisanie.PNG" src="http://team.enaza.ru/upload/medialibrary/036/opisanie.PNG"><br>  At one time, we spent a lot of time and effort on moderating content from copyright holders.  It is clear that each developer sent a game or a program describing "The most super duper game, hit 200X of the year ......" even if all users understood that this was a fuzzy remake of the 1993 game.  As it turned out, <b>60% of users already know everything about content</b> and there is no need for them to prepare a bunch of screenshots, video clips and patches. <br><br>  <b>6. Does the user plan to purchase?</b> <br><br><img height="289" width="481" title="planirovanie.PNG" alt="planirovanie.PNG" src="http://team.enaza.ru/upload/medialibrary/366/planirovanie.PNG"><br><br>  Early it seemed that content is bought spontaneously.  It is a myth!  There is no need to flood the user with ads, clouds of banners, and an offer to buy a program for "learning how to work on a computer with the mouse", do not waste time, your buyer already knows why he came, <b>better throw off the price for a couple of ten rubles</b> . <br><br>  <b>7. What payment systems are preferable for the user?</b> <br><br><img height="466" width="972" title="platezhki.PNG" alt="platezhki.PNG" src="http://team.enaza.ru/upload/medialibrary/3b4/platezhki.PNG"><br><br>  Remember from question number 2 that 55% of users have plastic cards?  But for some reason, using cards only pay 18% of users.  As it turned out, it is convenient for many to pay with the help of payment terminals.  To the question "why?"  There are 2 obvious answers <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Just</b> .  You do not need to authorize the card, register and receive codes on your mobile phone. </li><li>  <b>Safe</b> .  Losing a couple of thousand dollars from the card, because you didn‚Äôt check your email for viruses and someone sfishil your data - a dubious pleasure. </li></ul><br>  That's when payment systems provide these two factors, more than half of all purchases on the Internet will be made through plastic cards. <br><br>  <b>8. And finally - that stops users from buying content on the Internet.</b> <br><br><img height="289" width="481" title="planirovanie.PNG" alt="planirovanie.PNG" src="http://team.enaza.ru/upload/medialibrary/0e5/stop_buying.PNG"><br>  Obviously, the success of selling content online consists of 4 basic principles: <br><ul><li>  <b>Reliability.</b>  The user must be sure that he will receive what he has paid for, therefore, test any development that affects the user‚Äôs receiving content and provide round-the-clock technical support. </li><li>  <b>Increase download speed</b> .  Place content as close as possible to the user, collaborate with providers and rent data centers in regions </li><li>  <b>Work with usability of your portals.</b> </li><li>  <b>Sell ‚Äã‚Äãon credit.</b>  Agree with payment systems to lend to users. </li></ul><br>  This is where the first part of our analytical narrative has come to an end, we will be happy to provide you with a lot of new and interesting things related to digital content.  We have already begun a large-scale study on how to most effectively attract the user and accompany him in the buying process ... Wait!  :-) <br><br>  PS: We will be glad to any questions and wishes, we also really want to get acquainted with the representatives of the copyright holders of games, music, video, software, audiobooks, Internet providers and payment systems.
