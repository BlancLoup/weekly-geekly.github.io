I answer with us for sites and news, but from time to time I write <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/synesis/blog/217019/">various</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/synesis/blog/219611/">articles</a> on <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/synesis/blog/239835/">Habra</a> .  I noticed that despite the scale of the annual Moscow forum All-over-IP that took place last week, they never wrote about it here.  Perhaps resource readers would be interested to find out what this event is and what they eat it with. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  All-over-IP for exhibitors is a meeting for old friends.  Offhand, 80% sell iron, and 20% - software (someone - all at once).  Since the exhibition has already been held for the seventh time, everybody roughly represents what one company or another will show.  But the interest does not disappear anywhere.  Main areas: machine vision, video surveillance, telecommunications, storage systems, IP security and clouds.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/832/e98/3b1/832e983b149c44bc9a4ebb51ac57db77.JPG"><br><br>  It should be noted here that the amount of information provided in some places is simply overwhelming: both days, from the first minutes to the very close, thematic conferences were held in several halls, where mostly general directors of exhibiting companies spoke. <br><br>  The total number of subject conferences was 4: Machine Vision, IT &amp; Cloud LAB, Intelligent Video 2.0 and Smart and Safe City.  Add to this a dozen speeches, announced by the organizers as ‚ÄúBusiness Guru‚Äù (CEO Axis, Bosh, Milestone Systems, NUUO Inc.), key reports from visionaries (Onvif, Panasonic, Dallmeier, again Bosh and others), a separate series of reports codenamed ‚ÄúDesigner's Day‚Äù (do not believe, Bosh) and regular lectures, seminars, presentations at the stands of companies, and you will understand that without a clear plan, with heightened curiosity, there is no way.  My seizure plan was something like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6a8/d55/2a3/6a8d552a3b64477f94728f0e649bcb92.jpg"><br><br>  And this is only part of the first day.  The plan, by the way, turned out to be overly optimistic: because of the work at the stand, we managed to listen in fits and starts.  But the visitors of this problem, of course, no. <br><br>  Unfortunately, if you are interested in several directions at the same time, you will have to choose one or the other. <br><br>  The usual exhibition practice: in almost every report, the speaker puts on the agenda a question-problem, the answer to which is his technology or product.  But, firstly, it was also interesting to look at the products, and secondly, the speakers shared their mistakes, which is no less fascinating. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/561/5d5/e8f/5615d5e8f9dd4dcbb6fc7c348ff2fa35.JPG"><br><br>  Walking on the stands, you have to go through a little psychological test: wherever you turn your head, you see yourself everywhere.  Either tracking an object, then another face detector, then just a demonstration of a picture from a high-resolution camera. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/283/c94/f02/283c94f021c442bb841469456f5a9ac4.jpg"><br><br>  The girls, hired for beauty, smiled only for the first couple of hours, and then they missed completely, apparently, not really understanding what they were doing here.  A pity, they even looked at the camera as if they were an enemy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a6b/64d/dca/a6b64ddca72046699fe24e95ba734278.jpg"><br><br>  That's true, I wanted to show you something for a cute and fun.  Unless, the security robot from Zelenograd approached this definition. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f04/fc4/915/f04fc4915458410184f1ac05ca5fce08.jpg"><br><br>  But interactive, of course, was.  Here, for example, Videomax was always playing something in darts, alternating another tournament with presentations.  Bosh for some reason, rolled a motorcycle to the stand (they were not allowed to be photographed on it), Hikvision handed out branded candy (delicious). <br><br>  But All-over-IP, after all, is not about entertainment.  The main thing here is information and contacts.  There is no better place to find a business partner, analyze competitors' developments and simply raise the general level of ‚ÄúIP awareness‚Äù. <br><br>  For me personally, the second day passed under the banner of the Intelligent Video 2.0 conference, which is also explained by the fact that Synesis is involved in video analytics and that it was conducted and opened by our general, Nikolay Ptitsyn.  The conference was very pleased: a real whale-style debate against an elephant or a skier against a snowboarder began at it.  The first speaker defended the video analyst on the server, the other in the cell.  And so take turns.  It is interesting, on which side the readers of Habra.  We are, for obvious reasons, for the whale. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/859/d68/9a3/859d689a3ce24688818b2c956dbf37f9.JPG"><br><br>  The general trend in the development of video analytics, which could be easily followed, is to expand its scope.  Direct cause-effect relationships work here: developers offer ready-made solutions, since competition forces them to reduce implementation timelines, and reduction of terms reduces the budget.  Profit - video analytics are more accessible, which toughens competition and stimulates developers more, and so on, in a spiral. <br><br>  Or, for example, data center megaprojects and work with really Big Data takes video analytics to cluster servers and to the clouds. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3a4/047/6ec/3a40476ec56945929739f3cdbc4e4ba1.jpg"><br><br>  There were also slightly crazy geniuses.  So, for example, a man approached us at the stand, who introduced himself as a professor of psychology (!) And said that a person at the time of anger vibrates so much that any (!) Camera catches it.  And based on this vibration, you can make a fight detector and, accordingly, prevent it.  It was thought that at rush hour in the subway everything is as one - potential aggressors and initiators of fights.  And also, that with the implementation of such a fantastic module, they will delay for thought-offing. <br><br>  Under the very closing of the exhibition, when we were already assembling a booth, they tried to get to know me only in the way that such forums could have.  One of the visitors, who was obviously too actively enjoying the cocktails that were handed out at the Axis stand, approached and asked: <br>  - Deeeushk, and you have a vacancy in the company? <br>  ‚ÄúOnly in the Minsk office,‚Äù I answered honestly. <br>  - Maybe a cocktail then? .. <br>  It was ok, without cocktails, but if you are an experienced QA or Front-end developer, you are welcome. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/244339/">https://habr.com/ru/post/244339/</a></p>
