  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What progress has reached, or c 1C can work on iPod</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  As you know, one of the charms of the SaaS model is mobility and ubiquitous access.  No one is surprised by the fact that with various programs you can work from mobile devices: work with mail (corporate including), with social.  networks, various chat rooms (ICQ, Skype and so on).  The main thing is to have access to the Internet. <br><br>  And what about 1C programs when working in them via mobile devices? <br><br>  1C Company stated that in the new release of the 1C 8.2.14 platform, in the beta status, the implementation of a web client running on an iPad running a mobile browser was created.  And, of course, with the support of touch input.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  This was decided to check the employees of 1CAir, which provides 1C products for rent on the SaaS-model.  At hand was the iPod (2G iPod Touch (32GB)).  By the way, quite an old iPod.  We decided not to postpone the testing procedure and try to run 1C on it.  But what if?  In fact, on the iPod there is access to the Internet (wi-fi), Safari browser is (although as it turned out you can use others, but more on that later).  The only screen of course smaller than the iPad.  But for testing is quite suitable. <br><br>  We started testing ... <br><br>  1CAir leases more than 30 1C programs.  We decided to use the demobase for 8.2.14 of the product ‚ÄúINTALEV: Corporate Management 7 + Management of a Production Enterprise‚Äù.  Since I was not interested in the functionality of the 1C product, but in the ability to work on the 1C release 8.2.14 on the iPod, the above product is quite suitable. <br><br>  So, let's begin. <br><br>  In the browser entered the link to enter.  The launch takes from 1 to 3 minutes.  Since the device has an ARM 533 MHz processor, it is not surprising.  In principle, tolerable, but I would like to quickly, of course. <br>  Tried to run 1C through 2 browsers: pre-installed on iPod Safari and OperaMini.  Works the same.  On some images you can see what was launched through OperaMini. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d35/4a2/b19/d354a2b19f48f2d36517e7b5e30dadfd.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e42/879/1d4/e428791d469bb147657afeb7983ec6e6.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/75c/99b/22e/75c99b22eefec305db490380539bb9b1.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/81c/5fd/92a/81c5fd92a8090de7f6b0684e3cf7d158.jpg" alt="image"><img src="http://s003.radikal.ru/i202/1109/37/668143445f62.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  So, the launch went great, and we can see the program workspace. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2b3/42f/294/2b342f294ef242eef7e4d8dddfa98adf.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Two tasks were chosen for testing: to compile a management report and apply for a ticket for a business trip. <br>  Let's see what came of it. <br>  1. Management report. <br>  On the images below you can see all stages of the report.  The usual form for drawing up a report opens, its fields are filled in, and, finally, the report itself is formed.  Since the screen of the device is small (3.5 inches), then to view all report fields, you need to scroll to the right and down.  But even with this format, it is quite possible to see the necessary information.  The keyboard is not needed here; all the fields were filled out from the opening lists. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a61/b88/2d5/a61b882d506321a51c1e6147a0de3c09.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c66/434/97b/c6643497b8f4c31317ccf55666d14f59.jpg" alt="image"><img src="http://i074.radikal.ru/1109/a6/3e724486cc39.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e7e/119/dd9/e7e119dd93e8071b526403c634e13b70.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4e3/e79/676/4e3e79676d4b78fdca18ba1d4208a12a.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3f5/f88/2c2/3f5f882c2c1d6dd1d5a8f9eda760fb80.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  2. Application for a ticket. <br>  The images clearly show all stages of the application.  There is already used for data entry and keyboard.  Typing is convenient. <br><br><img src="http://i047.radikal.ru/1109/31/bd9dcab55052.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ea9/32d/991/ea932d9918b06b790619caab07ff5cdb.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/537/b4c/b76/537b4cb76aaae790f8e112fce51dc953.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/28b/c3f/e35/28bc3fe359f3a7255dc8ccf35cc0b6b4.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/17a/8f2/a11/17a8f2a111f36ece2a7da55dd0d71406.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fbf/105/eef/fbf105eefad76eab13e7f106a4724b1b.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1d5/1fb/6c0/1d51fb6c020997cb2e93840bd77f3408.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Plus, the charts are well displayed, the calculator works, you can see the plans of accounts, create an account. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/da9/d8b/4ad/da9d8b4add38baa83cd9e7fdd4995e70.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/609/c8a/caf/609c8acaf24e3dc9281f8b82a194b18c.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/731/574/6a0/7315746a037e42b65934cd4b62bc5946.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Summary. <br>  1C through the iPod works!  And it is very pleased!  With 1C, you can even work through the player!  So, it will work on the iPad.  And it will be much more convenient for several reasons: <br>  1. Larger display.  Of course, the iPod display is smaller, but scrolling works fine.  Plus there will be an opportunity to train the memory, so as not to constantly scroll there and here.  We are joking, of course, but, as is known, in every joke there is only a fraction of the joke. <br>  2. It will work faster.  It is difficult to argue, as the technical characteristics speak for themselves.  Although ... It depends on what tasks you will use.  If you do not need to work with large arrays of data, but simply track some information, then it is fine. <br>  3. Access to the Internet.  IPod only via wi-fi.  If you want to supply, for example, your sales representatives with 1Cs for working with 1C, this will not be the best idea.  Not every retail outlet will have wi-fi.  But iPad 2 is possible, there will be access on 3G. <br>  In the end, of course, for serious work with 1C iPod is not particularly suitable.  But if you already have an iPod and you only need to watch reports, charts, task execution, and so on (something that does not require a lot of workload), then that's fine.  In general, of course, it is better to use the iPad as a temporary and necessary replacement for a full-fledged computer. <br>  Personally, we repeat, I was pleased with the fact: With 1C, you can even work through the player!  That's what progress has come to ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/127992/">https://habr.com/ru/post/127992/</a></p>
