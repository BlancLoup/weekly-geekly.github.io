  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Business bricks</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  What you need to build a successful business?  Let's directly list the points, it will not be superfluous. <br><ol><li>  A good idea.  This is the basis of business and its very beginning. </li><li>  Good head.  Without a good head, you can poker the best idea - it is therefore vital for a business to have a head for someone who does this business. </li><li>  Straight arms.  It is relatively speaking.  It often happens that a person having decent thoughts in his head cannot really realize them - there are not enough skills of socialization, communication, some personal qualities can interfere.  Therefore, "straight arms" are also very important. </li><li>  Start-up capital.  Under the starting capital, I will mean not only assets in the form of cash and acquired means of production, the so-called.  liabilities, but also intangible capital - knowledge, experience and connections owned by the entrepreneur.  Tangible and intangible assets have absolutely equal value and it is very difficult to convert them into each other - money in communication, experience in money is not actually converted directly. </li><li>  What this article is about.  Business environment. </li></ol><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  All the time the company is in contact with the external environment.  The external environment of the enterprise in a broad sense constitutes the entire business world, lying beyond its borders - customers, suppliers, subcontractors;  circumstances, events;  country laws, third-party service terms, etc.  etc.  One of the primary objects for medium and small businesses are environment objects such as service companies.  This primacy comes from the fact that medium and small businesses usually do not have the ability to carry most of the business process on their shoulders and give much to outsource.  As a result, it turns out that an enterprise essentially depends on its business partners: in general, these are suppliers and subcontractors.  This, of course, is risky for an enterprise - because in conditions of limited free funds, in which small and medium-sized companies are often forced to work, it is difficult to organize the reservation of individual parts of a business process, it is difficult to make a reserve in working capital, therefore nominally enterprises usually work with a minimum margin strength.  Some help to reduce the risks helps the competent choice of partners and the fact that the whole business environment of the company is not within the same structure - that is, the company is served by many other companies and if one of them falls out of the cage, all the others will continue to operate. <br><br>  When I started my first business, I had to deal with the US market, so I got the opportunity to look out of the corner of my eye, what they have and how it is done in the sense of the service sector.  Comparing the situation there later with our, Moscow, I was somewhat discouraged. <br><br>  To begin with, fundamentally, the profitability of any company directly depends on how efficiently it operates in the market.  The more efficient the company creates surplus value, the greater its profitability.  Efficiency in this case implies minimization of costs and rationality in the launching of the company's cash flow (which also ultimately also results in the minimization of costs).

      There is such a sign, or proverb, or, I don‚Äôt know, a saying: ‚ÄúThe flow moves at the speed of the slowest component of the flow.‚Äù Obviously, your business process will move at the speed of the slowest component of this process.  And if your business risks of financial failure were partially redeemed with a competent choice of business environment, then you cannot ensure the smooth operation of the components of this environment - this is just outside your zone of influence.  And here we come across an underwater (for many) stone: your competitiveness directly depends on the quality of services supplied to you by service organizations.  The clearer they perform their duties for the money that you pay them, the better for your business, and for your clients, for whom you will be able to complete the work on time and efficiently. <br><br>  Business institutions and business environments in developed countries with market economies are at a high stage of development, and they understand the contents of the previous paragraph very well.  To build a business you need construction materials - in many respects a business does not consist of what you yourself do with your own hands and the hands of your subordinates, but of what your external environment provides you with - these are the business bricks from which you build your building business.  If the bricks and mortar arrive late, your building will be late.  During downtime, you risk losing relevance or market share in favor of a competitor. <br><br>  At first glance, the blame for this should be placed on the environment: indeed, only them should be blamed for non-fulfillment of their obligations, and in this case ‚Äúbricks‚Äù should also be blamed for your failure in the market.  But the manager who faced such a problem will say that it is not so, and one really good manager buys out one thing: the ability to work ahead of such situations.  And with them [situations] really need to fight. <br><br>  What for?  Because we need a business environment with the right bricks.  After all, each of us - the same brick for someone else.  In order to correct the situation of a complete PPC [which is happening today in many homeland markets], one should not wait for the appearance of changes from the outside, but start them from the inside.  To cover the risks of the emergence of situations of non-fulfillment and untimely fulfillment of YOUR obligations and try to provide our clients with the service they deserve by bringing you their money.  And do not complain that there is no solution. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/41287/">https://habr.com/ru/post/41287/</a></p>
