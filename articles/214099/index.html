  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Design Basics</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We recommend to get acquainted with the re-published classic textbook on the basics of design, one of the most popular in the world.  The theory of design, a lot of practical examples and all the necessary information for novice designers and professionals who want to improve their skills. <br><br>  In the new edition of " <a href="http://www.piter.com/product/osnovy-dizayna">Fundamentals of Design</a> ", as in the previous eight, the text has undergone processing.  You ask, what changes are made to the elements and principles of design?  In fact, the very means and forms in which we use them evolve very quickly.  Each subsequent edition adds new media, new art forms and new images from everyday life.  Along with this, examples from various eras and cultures are given, as in previous editions.  But that is not all.  In the text of each section there are links to others, so that ideas echo and develop from section to section.  This is evident from the example of two pictures, to which we return in each chapter.  How much different "Harlequin" Picasso and "Duel after the Masquerade" Jerome!  How much they can say about the composition and all aspects of design besides the fact that they depict a man in a harlequin costume!  Alterations, changes are inseparable from the process of creating a design solution.  Even the masterpieces are obtained after a series of changes: we see this in the photographs, which captured the process of creating the ‚ÄúPink Nude‚Äù painting by Matisse.  Artists do not always fix this process, but often it is obvious.  The corrections we see are called pentimento, which means, if translated from Italian literally, ‚Äúthe artist repents‚Äù.  This is the most difficult <br>  A lesson for beginning designers: stop clinging to the first idea and, after a series of changes, come to another, better one.  Writing this text has also been a process of continuous rethinking and rework.  As mentioned earlier, many new images have appeared in this edition.  Also here you will find a number of new discussions. <br><br> <a href="http://www.piter.com/product/osnovy-dizayna"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7ea/4d0/ee9/7ea4d0ee9ea4f4019692dc6ce596bc69.jpg" alt="image"></a>

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Chapters 2 and 3 added examples of graphic design.  Chapter 4 presents the works of contemporary artists, including Pavel Pepperstein, who was honored at the Venice Biennale in 2009.  Chapter 5 includes a discussion of the perception of symmetry of a human face.  Chapter 6 provides two examples of Niklaus Troxler‚Äôs jazz posters.  Chapter 7 gives examples of using the line ‚Äî from a conventional topographic map to a Picasso drawing created by light.  Chapter 8 now takes a deeper look at various areas and disciplines in art and design.  Fashion and painting unite the love of forms.  Chapter 9 includes a description of the transformations of materials and their textures for decorative purposes by Anna Albers.  Chapter 10 shows a perspective image of the unfinished drawing of Leonardo da Vinci and the drawings of Frank Lloyd Wright.  Chapter 11 provides a more detailed discussion of the motion transmission, including the ‚Äúcrucial moment‚Äù of Cartier-Bresson and the digital photograph of the dancer Elliot Barnathan.  Chapter 12 deals with the boundaries of our perception on the example of paintings by Roman Opalka, resembling a ‚Äúwhite square‚Äù.  Chapter 13 contains new thoughts about changing the artists ‚Äôpalette over time.  Thoughts of reviewers, teachers, and researchers, as well as the Worthsworth / Kengeyge Learning art team, helped a great deal in the work on the book (Wadsworth / <br>  Cengage Learning), which took over its publication. <br><br>  Prototype: Design Basics <br>  Authors: David A.
