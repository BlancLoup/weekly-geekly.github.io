As if not so.  So we will understand where the dog is buried and what is the nature of this delusion. <br><br>  All that is reflected in this note is the result of the introduction of the social buttons Grrow on several dozen sites of various subjects and observations, which content is given by primary sources to social networks. <br><br>  So what we are faced with and understood.

      On the one hand there is a site with good content, attendance, design, social buttons are, comments, and social traffic - the cat wept.  And it will not. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/21d/a0b/f84/21da0bf8404e866ae14a37c9e257f9e6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Do you know why? <br><br>  Many of us do not see the difference in the structure of content on the site and its reflection in social networks, and therefore the peculiarities of perception by the audience of the same content in different places. <br><br>  This, from my point of view, is understandable.  Who until recently was the main provider of traffic to any site?  Of course search engines.  And in the head of many webmasters hammered the standard of content delivery for search engines.  Well, you yourself know them. <br><br>  However, social networks straightened their shoulders, gained a huge audience and became a source of good traffic.  And the standards for presenting information are completely different.  Because people are far from robots, they are not driven by analysis and algorithms.  People are driven by emotions. <br><br>  But let's order: <br><br>  So, how does a webmaster think, for example, a content site?  Yeah, I wrote a good article, everything is SEO correct, I have social buttons at the beginning (this is a good tone) and at the end of the article (which is also not bad).  The visitor will read, click the social button, zapropostit article on his wall and here he is social traffic in my pocket.  It works, but weakly. <br><br>  Why?  Because the webmaster thinks like everyone else.  Want more social traffic - think differently.  Think one step further. <br><br>  <u>Try to interest not so much your visitors as their friends in social networks.</u>  <u>After all, you want to attract them to your site using SMO.</u> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Just think about how to please your user‚Äôs friends.  What content should they see in social programs, what should encourage them to go to your website?  What emotions will they experience when they see your content in a friend‚Äôs feed?  There is something to think about ... <br><br>  Let's go further. <br><br>  The structure of content in social networks is standard - it is a photo, title (title) and description, that is, description. <br><br>  So why, when I want to make a repost on the site in 60% of cases in the repost is displayed the wrong picture?  It is necessary to thumb through pictures.  And often the desired picture is not there.  This is the identification of the content.  If I see, for example, in the feed on Faith, interesting content - I turn to the site of the source, and there the photo is different - the batthurd happens.  Instant unconscious feeling that you cheat. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/86f/c8c/3b8/86fc8c3b8ef0eca3171e452d09afadd2.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Some sites abuse plugs.  Well, for example, there is no photo in the article on the website - one text.  And a site logo is poking around in a social network, or some kind of monochrome picture, or a picture from where it came from, which is not related to the content.  This is bad, it does not attract, but rather scares in social networks.  People will not go from social networks to your site.  The picture plays an important role in the perception of information on the Internet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/777/5a9/e4b/7775a9e4b59e0e2a0df04d9596883f2c.png" alt="image"><br><br>  With the title everything seems to be easier.  It is reflected in the repost in its original form.  But there is one ‚Äúbut‚Äù - is your heading for social networks so good?  Does he attract attention?  Does he simulate the transition to the site source? <br><br>  Yes, of course you say.  Sure? <br><br>  See it.  What is the purpose of the title on the site?  Everything is obvious - to attract attention and make you read it or watch it to the end.  On the site you have under the hood 2 screens of text that can keep the intrigue and attention of the reader and leave the most delicious at the end of the article. <br><br>  What is the purpose of the header in the social network?  Different.  Encourage social user to go to your site.  The goals are different. <br>  How important is the title and how to write them a bunch of materials and articles written, we will not go deep into the wilds. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/69c/2cf/92d/69c2cf92dfde7ad22c0c1ce9935750e7.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The media is generally experimenting with headlines.  And there are also non-standard media projects like Upworthy, which only changing the headlines of the finished content collect 100 million people and hundreds of thousands of reposts.  Are you experimenting with headlines? <br><br>  Do you know on which sites with repost headers are very sad?  These are online stores.  Yes, it is e-commerce that suffers from this disease.  Not surprisingly, there is little social traffic in the stores. <br><br>  Experiment yourself, go to the site IM, click to share (there are social buttons everywhere) and look at the repost: <br>  - The trouble with the photo (not the photo is massively loaded); <br>  - repost header is the name of the product and the article. <br><br>  Who will go to your website from Contact?  No one. <br><br>  Go to the 3rd attribute of the post - the description, you can call it a social snippet.  As you understand, this is 3 lines under the repost header.  These three lines are not less important than the title and have their own peculiarity. <br><br>  Many people know or guess that the attention economy is working in the Internet.  This is especially true in social networks.  They attracted attention with their site, post, photo, video - they got traffic. <br><br>  It is important that you have 1 second to attract attention.  One second look at the screen to determine the interest and another 2 seconds to read the description and make a decision - go to the site source, Like, repost, comments. <br><br>  Look at your repost structure.  Will you go on it to the site?  So what do you expect from friends of your audience? <br><br>  Do not be discouraged, everyone has it))) With the description in my experience, most of all problems.  And then there just can not see and comments, and strange texts, or even the absence of them. <br><br>  Here is an example: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/705/353/6ac/7053536ac75946e99594a31e53dd9314.png" alt="image"><br><br>  And the solution to all such problems is - this is the Open Graph Protocol setting.  OPG markup links your content to social networks and presents it there correctly.  Open graph allows you to control the appearance of content announcements that users send to social networks, ‚Äúlike‚Äù and ‚Äúplus‚Äù. <br><br>  By the way, this is a field for experiments, you can customize different texts for different situations, actions, goods.  This is where your creative comes in handy. <br><br>  Where to get headlines and descriptions? <br><br>  Of course they need to come up with, watch the reaction is not afraid to experiment.  This is for content sites.  For online stores, we can recommend the following: look at what people write in the comments for such a product, what they like, what they value.  From this information can be born good content.  Add an emotional component to your repost.  Content is read in social networks by people - try to cause surprise, interest, curiosity, outrage, etc.  Use storytailing. <br><br>  How would I submit a repost from the example above: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/eb4/64f/f72/eb464ff7293ef4ba1fba9a8d693994bd.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Well, in the end I would like to say that SMO is an adaptation of the site for people, not for social networks.  Do not forget about it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/222245/">https://habr.com/ru/post/222245/</a></p>
