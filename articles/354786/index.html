  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Obtaining a work permit in the Czech Republic: the case of a dual labor card</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good afternoon, dear readers! <br><br>  In the comments to my <a href="https://habr.com/post/334306/">last article</a> on employment in the Czech Republic a question arose about the legal aspects of working in the Czech Republic.  In this article I would like to delve a little into this topic and consider one of the cases of obtaining a labor card - the case of the so-called dual card.  This case is of particular interest because it is more complicated than obtaining a non-dual card and there are some nuances that are often difficult to solve without the help of a lawyer.  Who cares, I ask under the cat. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Introduction </h2><br>  To begin, I will explain what is meant by the dual labor card.  Dual employment card involves obtaining a work and residence permit in the country.  A non-dual employment card serves only as a residence permit.  Immediately clarify that the article discusses the situation for a person who already has a long-term visa or residence permit.  Being abroad apply through the embassy or consulate.

      As mentioned in the <a href="https://habr.com/post/354128/">article</a> , students who receive a bachelor‚Äôs degree, master‚Äôs degree or PhD status have free access to the labor market.  In this case, you can immediately apply for a labor card, having an employment contract with the company.  However, there are situations when you can not successfully complete your studies and get a diploma of graduation.  In this case, it becomes necessary to obtain that dual resolution. <br><br>  I myself found myself in the situation of the need to receive such a card, so I set forth everything in the article based on my own experience.  So, a few words about yourself.  I study in doctoral studies.  Due to certain circumstances, I cannot get PhD status and must complete my doctoral studies this year.  For this reason, I do not have free access to the labor market and therefore I am considering the option of a dual card. <br><br><h2>  Work searches </h2><br>  To obtain a card, you firstly need to find a suitable vacancy and sign an agreement, which is the basis for living and receiving a labor card.  However, there are already some nuances.  To understand the situation, it is best to seek advice from a good lawyer who will explain all the legal difficulties and advise what steps to take to obtain a labor card. <br><br>  So, the procedure is as follows: to apply for a dual labor card, you need to conclude an employment contract for one of the special vacancies that are published on the special <a href="https://portal.mpsv.cz/sz/zahr_zam/zamka/vm">portal MPSV</a> (the so-called companies - holders of the labor card, in Czech dr≈æitele zamƒõstnaneck√© karty).  The following rule applies here: if a suitable Czech candidate is not found for such a job within a month, then a foreign applicant can be admitted to it, and only in this case the applicant has the right to apply for a labor card. <br><br>  On the search page on the MPSV portal, you can easily find vacancies in any area of ‚Äã‚Äãinterest, in a particular city and region, and find positions for a specific company.  Each vacancy on this portal, among other things, must have a vacancy name (Po≈æadovan√° profese) and a vacancy number (ƒå√≠slo voln√©ho m√≠sta). <br><br>  Here there is a certain possibility of employment and for a vacancy that has not previously been published on the portal MPSV.  However, in this case, it will be necessary to agree with the company that the company will publish a vacancy on this portal and only after a month will it be possible to conclude an agreement and apply for a labor card.  Not all companies are ready for such a step. <br><br><h2>  Preparation of documents for applying for a card </h2><br>  Secondly, you need to prepare all the necessary documents.  The following documents are required to apply for an employment card: an application form (you can download it <a href="http://www.mvcr.cz/soubor/zadost-o-zamestnaneckou-kartu-request-for-employee-card.aspx">from here</a> ), an employment contract with a company, a residence contract (a lease agreement or a hostel contract) and a nostrification diploma with a certified copy of the translation.  In addition, you need to purchase postage stamps in the amount of 1500 CZK. <br>  This is a certified copy of the diploma translation: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ev/66/5k/ev665kyzcow2gvwpwverz-januq.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cx/8f/bc/cx8fbcqjlvyiymaxmjs-tgfxr6g.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  But the confirmation of the recognition of a diploma of higher education (nostrification): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1-/bs/xg/1-bsxgmp62e0f-k57-tbyvrdf-o.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Now proceed to filling out the application.  The first page is filled as follows: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/a-/2s/3s/a-2s3sb0_vtkk_lgslb2spxti_c.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  In section A, tick off ‚Äúpo≈æadovan√° pracovn√≠ pozice je v centr√°ln√≠ evidenci voln√Ωch pracovn√≠ch m√≠st obsaditeln√Ωch dr≈æiteli zamƒõstnaneck√© karty‚Äù and in the ƒå√≠slo voln√©ho m√≠sta field indicate the same position number that I mentioned above.  Then in section B we indicate our personal data (name, surname, telephone, e-mail, date and place of birth, gender, marital status, education received). <br><br>  This is how the second page should be filled in: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tg/1e/aa/tg1eaauxh31c00k9ycn0ol-ye7u.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  In section C we indicate the data on the selected vacancy.  In the Pracovn√≠ za≈ôazen√≠ field, we indicate the exact position name from the position description on the mpsv.cz portal.  In section E we indicate our Czech address.  More on this page do not need to fill out. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/b_/dz/gy/b_dzgyxtdcpiqozuszg1fhgmtvw.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the third page we only indicate the information about the last long-term stay in the Czech Republic in section H (P≈ôedchoz√≠ pobyt na √∫zem√≠ ƒåesk√© republiky del≈°√≠ ne≈æ 3 mƒõs√≠ce) and the data on the international passport in section I. On page 4 we indicate the parents' data in the same way as we indicated in the application form for long-term residence for the purpose of training. <br><br>  Documents must be submitted in the local department for migration policy and refugee affairs of the Ministry of the Interior of the Czech Republic (OAMP MV ƒåR).  After filing all the documents, the worker will give you an application number to track the status.  The maximum time for consideration of the application is two months. <br><br>  That's all.  I wish you all good luck in finding a job and getting a residence permit!  I will be glad to answer any questions you may have in the comments. <br><br>  Ps.  A new amendment to the law on the stay of foreigners has appeared and urgent labor visas are being introduced.
