I also want to.  Is it possible?  Sometimes yes, sometimes no. <br><br>  The other day I wandered to a wonderful conference.  She was called ‚ÄúSuccessful Leader‚Äù and took place in my Samara.  I hasten to share my emotions and impressions. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Two days of the conference included 6 presentations and 4 master classes.  Every day, two master classes were held in parallel, so I could not attend two.

      I will list the names of trainers, if you are interested in their thoughts - we can find them on the Internet.  Google knows everything.  And Yandex. <br><br><h4>  Boris Zhalilo.  Master class "Domestic sales: how to sell the task?" </h4><br>  People are divided into open and closed.  And also on confident and insecure.  So four types of people are formed. <br>  After talking with a person, you can understand what he is.  A person gives us signals that allow us to classify his behavior and determine the type.  Signals - this is the style of communication, gestures, clothing, workplace.  Each type loves its approach.  For everyone there are words that he wants to hear, and words that he better not speak. <br><br>  And every type wants its own.  Closed and uncertain wants peace, open and unsure - comfort, open and confident of status and prestige, closed and confident - benefits. <br><br>  The task of each of them should be set in accordance with his expectations.  And if you communicate with many at once, then you need to feed the feelings of each type. <br><br>  Boris Zhalilo in great detail and with pleasure spoke about these methods, gave examples, gave tables of signals by which a person can be classified, forbidden words and words - balm.  It was interesting. <br><br><h4>  Kirill Gulenkov.  Technologies of reflection and manipulative attacks </h4><br>  Kirill Gulenkov cheated and changed his program, most of his master class called ‚ÄúResponsible Negotiations: Prevention and Overcoming Stress Techniques‚Äù he talked about manipulation.  And he did the right thing!  He also spoke about stress, but he took this topic as much as he needed. <br><br>  So, what was discussed. <br><br>  People have three types of behavior: action, communication, and analysis.  The former act by pressure, prompting people to do what they say (such rhinoceros).  Communicators agree, they are open to communication, they convince.  People with an analytical warehouse calculate everything to the last detail, they are restrained and mistrustful. <br><br>  It so happened that in the confrontation among them there is no absolute champion - the man of action scores the communicator, but surrenders to the tediousness of the analyst, who in turn may fall victim to the communicator.  It's like rock-paper-scissors. <br><br>  Kirill Gulenkov told about the theory, and then turned to the exercises.  He took the role of a customer of one of the types, and one of us tried to confront him with the help of the technician he spoke about.  I turned out to be a careless student.  We sat against each other, he introduced himself as a communicator - in the end I gave up very quickly and absolutely for no reason gave him a discount for anything. <br><br>  I used to read about these things, but in the mouth of Cyril they became somehow clearer and simpler.  Thanks for that. <br><br><h4>  Frank Pucelik.  Secrets of a professional communicator </h4><br>  Frank went farther from the plan for his report, announced in the books that were distributed to us.  Or rather, he did not even depart from the plan, but did not reach it.  During the hour of his speech, he showed only three slides, including the first one, where he introduced himself.  But how he conducted his master class!  It was a very high-level one-man show.  Facial expressions, gestures, transitions from English to Russian and back.  The content did not lag behind the form. <br><br>  Frank talked about the structure of business in Russia, about the difference between competitive and controlled markets and businesses in them.  He spoke about the prospects and about the fact that we are restraining ourselves.  (Almost literally, only in Russian: before the race we shoot ourselves in the legs and then we start to run with difficulty. We are saved by the fact that everyone does this and in such Paralympic games we are no worse than the others).  He talked about telephones at meetings, the rules for answering calls and the best communications practices.  How does this American coach know how we are really doing?  And he really knows. <br><br>  As for the secrets of professional communicators, they are to be positive-minded and show interest.  And other emotions do not need to show.  Those.  it is necessary to practice in the toilet near the mirror to call them in order to understand how not to do it.  As for the other secrets - we did not reach them, but I do not regret it and hope to reach it some other time. <br><br><h4>  Radislav Gandapas.  The power of oratory </h4><br>  A confident person who knows how to make presentations, told how it should be and how not to do them.  It's like a recursion, the definition of the concept itself through itself.  Or like a stream that takes you along, makes you part of a stream. <br><br>  Radislav spoke about the 7 deadly sins and 7 virtues of the person making the presentation.  The jokes intertwined with serious things, the examples were chosen very well.  I would love to listen to him again. <br><br>  In his examples, I recognized myself.  For example, he said that it was necessary to make a plan of presentation in advance, and recalled that he left half a page as a child in order to later write the outline of an essay when it was written.  And I did that too. <br><br>  And Radislav cited examples of successful speeches.  I remember one example.  Radislav recounted the speech of an investor and a millionaire (sorry, I do not remember the name), speaking before college graduates.  At the meeting, he said that after college he was neither rich nor successful.  But his eyes were burning.  And graduates, he said, do not burn their eyes.  And then he said that he is an investor.  And what does an investor do?  He invests money and time.  Why invest in those who do not have eyes burning?  That's right, no need, so he leaves.  And left.  And almost reaching the end of the stage, where he performed, he turned and said: ‚ÄúYes, I almost forgot.  I was asked to finish on a positive note.  Good luck to you. ‚Äù  And he left completely.  People thought he would come back, beat the situation, turn everything into a joke.  But he did not return.  People were outraged, some were suing.  But over time, studies were conducted that showed a surge in success among graduates of that year (Just don‚Äôt ask me how they measured it).  Their program did not differ, and a year earlier and a year later it was the same ... <br><br>  Perhaps I liked the performance of Radislav Gandapas more than any other.  He's great! <br><br>  And I <s>stole</s> from him. I took over the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãreceiving questions from the audience during presentations via sms. <br><br><h4>  Two words about other speakers </h4><br>  Vladimir Kozlov said very interesting things about tough negotiations (negotiations under unequal conditions).  Unfortunately, I did not get to his master class.  What I regret.  He recorded on the disc his audio training on tough negotiations.  I listened to him - I liked it. <br><br>  Mark Kukushkin also made a good presentation, mentioning the Adizes methodology.  I love Adizes for a long time, somehow even wrote <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/arbeit/96731/">here</a> about his books.  And I didn‚Äôt get to the master class, which I regret too. <br><br><h4>  Total </h4><br>  Summing up - it was a good conference, two days passed quickly, some structure was lined up in my head.  No, the conference did not bring absolute discoveries; in one form or another, I already came across these ideas earlier. <br><br>  But she gave three things: <br><ul><li>  streamlined the knowledge that was, filled in the missing links, gave a complete picture; </li><li>  indicated directions that can be worked out; </li><li>  The speakers showed a good example of how to submit the material. </li></ul><br>  I also brought a notebook written with different ideas and a list of books that I would try to read. <br>  What I heard there, I told here in my own words.  The speakers used more correct words and detailed sentences.  And of course dry retelling can not convey all the emotions. <br><br>  If you have the opportunity - then get to know what these people are doing.  They are worth it! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/109277/">https://habr.com/ru/post/109277/</a></p>
