  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Conceptor.ru 4.0: Freedom of ideas!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The first release of the Conceptor.ru project took place <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/123869/">on July 12</a> , and to this day the main goal of the team was the implementation of an extensive work function plan, which could not fit into one version.  On August 10, we released version 3.0, codenamed ‚ÄúDocuments and Awards‚Äù, the main function of which was to discuss documents: the text is divided into fragments (chapters, paragraphs, blocks, etc.), each fragment is discussed separately, you can view comments and votes at all levels.  All this time, the site has been open to suggestions from our visitors.  As a result, one of the key features of version 4.0 was an offer from our user - crowdsourcing in action, so to speak. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the fourth version, we focused on three important things: simplifying the dissemination of ideas by inserting them into the pages of sites (taking into account the limitations of various social networks), translating the interface into English and the new functionality codenamed ‚ÄúFree Ideas‚Äù. <br><br>  After analyzing the restrictions on the insertion of HTML code in different systems, we came to the conclusion that the panacea is an image of the idea with a hyperlink to its discussion.  To show what is happening with an idea, its image is updated as soon as its quantitative indicators change: the number of votes and comments.  For more liberal sites, we also made an iframe insertion option to provide interactivity and the ability to vote directly on the site where the user saw the idea.  Here is how the picture insertion of the idea about the corresponding functionality looks like: <br><br> <a href="http://conceptor.conceptor.ru/idea/38"><img src="http://conceptor.conceptor.ru/idea/38/image" alt="image"></a> 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      The translation into English was not due to the desire to enter the world market, as it may seem at first glance, but quite the opposite: we wanted to give foreigners working in joint ventures the opportunity to use our site.  Language support will be launched soon (the technical part is ready, it remains to finish the translation). <br><br>  And finally, the most interesting.  At the beginning of the development of the project concept, the idea arose of giving users the opportunity to propose any ideas and use the site to discuss them.  However, there was one big but: a section with free discussion could turn into complete chaos and spoil the impression of service.  As a result, the functionality was completed, but postponed until better times, until it becomes clear what to do with it.  But literally two days after the launch of the site, user nangelo.kotenko put forward the following idea: <br><br> <a href="http://conceptor.conceptor.ru/idea/39"><img src="http://conceptor.conceptor.ru/idea/39/image" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  The idea is good for both users and organizations: users can offer something else before companies become our customers and companies start receiving feedback immediately and informally.  It soon became clear that here it was, the missing link for ‚ÄúFree Ideas‚Äù: each idea must necessarily be targeted at some organization ‚Äî a commercial company, a public association, or a state structure (why not?).  However, simply putting an idea and collecting voices for it is not enough - so what if it exists?  Then we made the following important decision: Conceptor.ru takes the responsibility to notify the organization about the idea proposed for it.  The only condition is that we will not be notified of all ideas, but only of those for which a certain number of votes have been received.  This is logical, because for an organization, the priority in the implementation of an idea is determined by its relevance.  We decided to start with a barrier of 30 votes in favor.  The form and date of notification will be indicated on the idea page.  The lack of response during the month will also be recorded, and, perhaps, over time, we will make a special list of organizations that are deaf to the wishes of their clients. <br><br>  The last feature of the work of "Free Ideas" - one hundred percent manual post-moderation of each idea.  The moderator has the right to remove any idea that is not a constructive proposal for a real-life organization. <br><br>  If, after notification of the organization, Conceptor.ru receives its official response, it will be published on the idea page.  If the organization decides to become a Conceptor.ru client, the idea, along with the discussion, will be moved to its portal. <br><br>  In general, ‚ÄúFree Ideas‚Äù is, of course, an experiment.  But it seems to us very interesting and promising.  The ‚ÄúFree Ideas‚Äù portal can be found here: <a href="http://idea.conceptor.ru/">idea.conceptor.ru</a> . <br><br>  The latest innovation in version 4.0, which I would like to mention in this article, was the <a href="http://conceptor.ru/help/prices">tariff page</a> .  Feel free: during September a special offer is valid for the ‚ÄúSubscriber‚Äù tariff. <br><br>  Together with <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/vostryakov/" class="user_link">vostryakov</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/127856/">https://habr.com/ru/post/127856/</a></p>
