Find out what's special about the new Pulsefire FPS</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>Hello% username%!</b>  By HyperX products, we often mean fast drives and memory modules inside gaming computers.  But PC gaming is not the only one with iron, so the special unit Kingston today releases all the gaming peripherals that gamers may need.  And now - a gaming mouse.  Why did HyperX take up the release of the "rodent"?  Because someone had to do everything right!  Today we will tell you what is special about this model, and what nuances the creators had to take into account in the development of Pulsefire FPS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dca/ce9/e27/dcace9e274f648adbd68ae8a92df324d.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The beauty of the PC has always been that it remained a ‚Äúhodgepodge‚Äù in spite of mono-brand models that were controlled by a single manufacturer.  It is precisely to competition that we owe to the fact that PCs have become an all-powerful machine from typewriters and supporting tools of scientists, even the home version of which can be ‚Äútuned‚Äù for workers, at least for gaming purposes. <br><br>  In the second case, oddly enough, the uniform filling becomes important.  If everyone chooses the fastest stuffing in the gland, then the peripherals are for the most part a matter of taste.  And, if your taste coincided with the taste of keyboard developers, the probability is very high that the rest of the ‚Äúkit‚Äù of the gaming machine will be to your taste.

      Therefore, HyperX today is not only memory with the support of hellish overclocking and fast SSDs, but everything that is needed to equip a cybersportsman.  Mechanical keyboards, sensitive gaming headsets, mats, and now, the first gaming mouse HyperX Pulsefire FPS!  And not easy, but <s>gold</s> running a PixArt 3310 sensitive sensor on any surface!  All gaming mice can be divided into models that are optimal for the MMORPG genre or FPS games.  Pulsefire FPS, as it is not difficult to guess, should be the best choice for shooters, in which the accuracy of guidance and ergonomics are much more important than the number of ‚Äúspecial moves‚Äù under each of the fingers. <br><br>  But are all these fancy gaming mice really useful?  After all, there is a perception that gaming peripherals are a kind of ‚Äúred mudguards for Zhiguli‚Äù.  That is, "+30 to speed" according to the owner, and "+100 to price" in comparison with office-class manipulators. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ef4/a5a/8e3/ef4a5a8e3c284c6d9f5fa5bb64ec39b2.jpg"><br>  <i>The HyperX gaming mouse is not a ‚Äúout of nowhere‚Äù model, but a top off gaming kit.</i> <br><br>  In addition, to make it more obvious to amateurs, what they pay extra for, the periphery manufacturers construct overwhelming ‚Äúmonsters‚Äù with wide bodies and a dozen keys, which they simply confuse under their feet with their fingers to prevent them from moving even a millimeter to the side. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2fe/f45/761/2fef45761796415a851379c95f33bd01.png"><br><br>  It turns out that not in the number of keys is strength, brother.  Then what? <br><br><h2>  All polymers have developed </h2><br>  Plastic is all over the head when it comes to electronic devices, and, moreover, computer peripherals.  The plastic case is in penny mice, which sell by weight Chinese stores, and in expensive models.  What is the difference? <br><br>  We discard the toxicity criteria, because only the most desperate "noname" practices dangerous types of plastics.  The rest of the plastic is different: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Durability</b> .  not in order to launch the mouse into the wall, but in order for the casing not to crack after a couple of years from ‚Äúfatigue‚Äù and not even start to creak. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Tactile sensations (stiffness)</b> .  It only seems that it makes no difference whether you play with a hard, ‚Äúwooden‚Äù mouse, or with soft-touch plastic.  The difference comes after a couple of hours or after a week with the regular launch of shooters or MMORPG.  Explain for a long time, just remember that the soft grip on working tools appeared for a reason. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Resistant to pollution</b> .  Starting with particles of dust, continuing with fingerprints and other "pleasures", which will envy the door to the entrance of a multi-storey building.  Gaming mice do not become slippery, sticky or "shiny" if you do not try to make them as dirty as possible on purpose. <br><br>  <b>Pulsefire FPS</b> , for example, is made of non-plastic plastic, and the side panels are textured, so that the ‚Äúrodent‚Äù is soft and does not slip in the hand at the height of the game. <br><br><h2>  Reliability does not happen much </h2><br>  Mice that throughout their life ‚Äúchase the cursor‚Äù across the screen can hardly be called irreplaceable.  Broke - threw - bought "about the same."  But to the gaming mouse, you ‚Äústick to it‚Äù, the effectiveness of the game depends on its shape, sensor features, keystroke and other parameters.  You can get used to the new mouse, but not immediately, and the process will not be pleasant. <br><br>  Therefore, gaming mice must be reliable - the new HyperX model, for example, is equipped with Omron switches.  In addition to the fact that they quickly work, with such a basis, the keys are able to survive 20 million clicks!  And the braided cable is not ‚Äúoak‚Äù and is well protected from wear. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9b1/a05/2fe/9b1a052fe18e468998c7a77dda914ab2.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Speed ‚Äã‚Äãand ease of use on an equal footing </h2><br>  The number of DPIs in a gaming mouse are numbers that are important, but only up to a certain threshold.  It's like with the speed of loading a web page: the less - the better, but in practice, an extra millisecond does not help readers read articles more quickly. <br><br>  The new HyperX mouse supports a really useful, the most "running" range with a margin <b>of 400 to 3200 DPI</b> .  It happens more, but outrageous figures are needed only for supermen with perfectly accurate hand movements, even with excessive sensitivity.  Megapixels, DPI and similar pleasures should always be in moderation, whatever marketers bawled at. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/099/c61/d88/099c61d88fbb451495574d2bbccfa990.jpg"><br><br>  In moderation, there should be keys on the case, because convenience in long gaming battles is more important than ‚Äúthe fourth key in the third row, something I assigned to it ...‚Äù while another fragment is ‚Äústuffed‚Äù to you.  Six robust keys in a comfortable and beautiful case (the mouse won the Red Dot Award 2017 for the design) is the minimum necessary outside which fan-specific equipment begins. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vLjxx10r2sM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h2>  In Russia - in the forefront </h2><br>  The HyperX Pulsefire FPS mouse will be available in Russia in June - for 4000 rubles you get a cool game pad with a two-year warranty, developed by one of the most reputable gaming brands. <br><br>  Nothing can replace skill and ingenuity even in amateur battles, but it is much more convenient to organize races in specialized shoes than in home slippers.

As proof of this, we give a <b><a href="http://hyperx.gg/GeekAlloyFPS">discount of 1000 rubles to a HyperX Alloy FPS mechanical keyboard</a></b> with a steel frame and Cherry MX, Blue or Brown switches to choose from.  The discount is relevant in Russia in all HyperX partner stores and will last until April 30, inclusive! <br><br>  And for fans of "lumbago" at the hearing and the ability to hear the location of the enemy at a great distance until April 30, there is a discount of <b>1000 rubles</b> for the gaming headset <a href="http://hyperx.gg/GeekSalesHX"><b>HyperX Cloud Drone</b></a> and <b>500 rubles</b> for the <a href="http://hyperx.gg/GeekSalesHX"><b>HyperX Cloud Stinger</b></a> .  We also know from ‚ÄúLittle Red Riding Hood‚Äù that in order to hear better, we need big ‚Äúears‚Äù, so do not miss the opportunity to buy headsets at a more affordable price on the DNS network! <br><br>  And also * drum roll * it's time to announce the lucky one who won the HyperX Cloud Revolver S flagship headset with a virtual 7.1-channel sound!  Recall the winner, we determined at random among the subscribers of the blog.  <b><a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/Fog666/">Fog666</a></b> became the owner of the headset.
