  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Banks have doubled the cost of cloud technology to save</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The German software developer <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAP">SAP</a> and the National Agency for Financial Research ( <a href="http://nacfin.ru/">NAFI</a> ) found that in 2016 the share of Russian banks' spending on cloud services will increase from 5 to 10% of IT budgets. <br><br>  The absolute costs of banks for cloud technologies will also increase by 2 times, said the general director of the agency Guzeliya Imaeva.  According to SAP, in 2015 they will be $ 51 million. <br><br>  Researchers surveyed 250 experts from the banking sector.  According to them, the main factor in the development of IT in banks is the growing popularity of mobile services.  Recently, banks are increasingly operations (including servicing businesses and individuals) through online channels.  While earlier Internet services played a supporting role.  Moreover, the trend is evolving, and banks are already looking for and finding ways to use big data analytics.  For example, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2588%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5">Big Data</a> technologies allow you to organize point sales. <a name="habracut"></a>

      Nevertheless, the interviewed experts are still wary of the introduction of Internet technologies in financial transactions: most often they store in the clouds data that is minimally related to customers and is not critical for banking.  At the same time, cloud technologies allow banks not only to optimize business processes, but also significantly save, experts admit. <br><br>  Cloud services allow you to get rid of the rigidity of the physical IT-infrastructure, explains the vice-president of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallels">Parallels</a> (the company produces software for virtualization) Vladimir Rubanov.  Virtualization allows you to quickly bring the infrastructure in line with the changing business needs. <br><br>  Savings are achieved at the expense of scale and increase in equipment utilization, therefore less technology is required to solve the same task.  According to him, the saving effect is most pronounced in public clouds.  As a result, giants like <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services">Amazon</a> can offer very low prices due to scale.  In private clouds, the savings are less, but information remains in the organization, so private clouds are closer to banks, says Rubanov. <br><br>  To prevent data leakage in the case of using public cloud services, you need to evaluate the provider and its protection methods, analyze the data of prospective consumers, explains Andrei Popov, board member of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B9%25D1%2584%25D1%2584%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B9%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BA">Raiffeisenbank</a> .  And private cloud services, in his opinion, do not differ from the classical IT model from the point of view of security. <br><br>  Raiffeisenbank does not plan to significantly revise budgets for cloud services, but their share in the bank‚Äôs IT line will grow: cloud technologies will speed up the introduction of new services and save on implementation, he admits. <br><br>  In addition, with the advent of high technology, the number of personnel is often reduced.  If a certain group of employees serviced business processes that are now automated or collapsed, then the company will receive a saving in labor costs. <br><br>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%258C%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D1%2584%25D1%2584_%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BA">Tinkoff Bank</a> uses both private cloud technology and public services for marketing and analytics, Darya Yermolina, a bank representative, <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2015/12/07/619867-zatrati-oblachnie-udvoyatsya">told</a> Vedomosti. <br><br>  ‚ÄúSberbank is now trying to develop not products, but services.  ‚ÄúTurnkey service‚Äù is a new trend: the client can come and they will be provided with a full infrastructure, where he will realize his business, ‚Äù <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/22450/">says the</a> director of the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BA_%25D0%25A0%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8">Sberbank of</a> Russia, Mikhail Malakhov. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIn fact, the tasks that face the enterprises of the financial sector are not formulated in such a way that the client should come, [and vice versa] the client does not need to come.  The trend that we see all over the world is either a complete rejection of bank branches or a fundamental reformatting with a significant reduction in their number, ‚Äùargues Alexey Ananiev, the chairman of the board of directors of <a href="http://www.technoserv.com/">the Technoserv</a> group of companies. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297066/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297066/</a></p>
