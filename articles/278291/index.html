      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Bloodaxe_(hacker)">Chris Goggans</a> (Erik Bloodaxe, in honor of Viking King <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_I_of_Norway">Eric I of Norway</a> ) - a founding member of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legion_of_Doom_%2528hacking%2529">the Legion of Doom group</a> , and a former editor of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrack">Phrack</a> magazine. <br><br>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyd_Blankenship">Lloyd Blankenship</a> , also known as The Mentor, described Goggans as <i>"the best hacker I have met</i> . <i>"</i> <br><br>  The US Secret Service raided Goggans on March 1, 1990, but was unable to catch him. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In a 1994 interview, Chris Goggans claimed that he had never been involved in malicious hacking, explaining it this way: <br><br><blockquote>  <i>‚ÄúMalicious hacking is in many ways the opposite of what I hold.</i>  <i>You always hear people talking about what's called a hacker ethic, and I really believe in that ethic.</i>  <i>I will never destroy anything.</i>  <i>I will never make the system fall and not erase anything from the system.</i>  <i>Every time I was in the system, I looked at the system, looked at how it was designed, how the directory structure differs from other types in other operating systems, made notes that these commands are the same as commands in other types of systems, it simplified me learning about this operating system. ‚Äù</i> </blockquote><br><blockquote>  <i>‚ÄúOf course, I was in‚Äú Legion of Doom ‚Äù.</i>  <i>I was in everyone's system.</i>  <i>But I have never been arrested.</i>  <i>I have never broken anything, I have never done anything truly, truly criminal bad. ‚Äù</i> <br></blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/de2/133/a1d/de2133a1d0444fa9b799588beac25a65.jpg"><br>  <i>T-shirts by Bloody Ax</i> <br><br>  But in a phone call intercepted by the Australian federal police, which was part of an investigation into the case of Australian hacker F Phoenix ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nahshon_Even-Chaim">Nahshon Even-Chaim</a> ), Goggans planned a raid in which this couple (Goggans and Phoenix) was going to steal the source code and the software under development from Execucom, developing software and technology in Austin, Texas, to sell this data to its competitors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/408/862/135/40886213573b79b08de97f6c6037489f.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  The call, recorded February 22, 1990 and later submitted to the court of Victoria (this is in Australia), as evidence against Even Khaimah.  Goggans and Even-Heim in the call discussed how much they can make on this business and how they share the Execucom received from competitors.  During the call, Goggans gave Even-Khaima a few numbers of dial-up connections to the Execucom computers, commenting: ‚ÄúHere, everything will be serious here‚Äù (‚ÄúI want to go there‚Äù), and ‚ÄúSomething must happen to Execucom ‚Äù(‚Äú ‚Äústuff that needs to happen to Execucom.‚Äù).  Although there is no evidence confirming that Goggans and Even-Heim committed what they were discussing, Goggans' statements raise questions about the purity of his hacker ethics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/821/623/2ff/8216232ffb8b7e3fd664800464756c1c.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  According to the 1995 Masters of Deception book: The Gang That Ruled Cyberspace, Goggans participated in the creation of his own computer security company in Texas in 1990.  They claimed that he planned to look for clients, hacking them and showing how vulnerable their systems are to other hackers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/938/632/9ca/9386329cac95de174077f5e115be41c7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At the time of 2005, Goggans is an internationally recognized information security expert.  He conducted a security assessment of the information network of some of the world's largest corporations, including all aspects of critical infrastructure (critical infrastructure), whose work unites 22 countries on four continents.  Chris has worked with US law enforcement on the most high-profile cases of computer crime.  His work has been featured in publications such as Time, Newsweek and Computerworld, and in services such as CNN and CNBC. <br><br>  He is a sought-after computer security lecturer and conducts training seminars for NATO, the US Department of Defense, and American law enforcement agencies, as well as for numerous private organizations.  He was asked to represent such important conferences as COMDEX, CSI, ISACA, INFOWARCON and Black Hat Briefings.  He also co-authored many books, such as: Implementing Internet Security, Internet Security Professional Reference, Windows NT Security, and The Complete Internet Business Toolkit. <br><br>  In the summer of 2003, Goggans was invited as an Associate Professor at the University of Tokyo Joint Research Center.  In the winter of 2008, Chris Goggans was in India, at <a href="http://www.clubhack.com/">ClubHack</a> , his own Indian hacker convention. <br><br>  At the moment, Goggans is president of SDI Inc., a Virginia-based information security consulting corporation. <br><br>  <b>Speech at DefCon:</b> <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ccEmhsPFzrM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500008,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgKqGyMYpFlP8o2GDbzJZXjskbydw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>‚ÄúInformation wants to be free‚Äù:</b> <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/SdCCUGJJxU8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500008,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhh_IN2Hd27P9zsCuuI1f9JtUXY7Aw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/278291/">https://habr.com/ru/post/278291/</a></p>
