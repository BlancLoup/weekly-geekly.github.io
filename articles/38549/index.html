We can do without excuses and accusations, though everyone has their own.  But if you try to streamline it, then it fits into two words - Crisis Genre. <br><br>  Habr has a crisis of the genre.  And when I say this, I mean not only the TM team, but also the community itself.  Habr moved to a new stage, which you will agree, it is never easy for anyone.  It's like during an illness.  First, the patient is unwell, then he has a crisis, and then he is recovering.

      What is the crisis?  From the community‚Äôs side, the crisis is felt in the fact that ‚Äúeverything is wrong‚Äù, ‚ÄúHabr is not the same‚Äù, ‚Äúrating is shit‚Äù, ‚Äúthey have banned my friends‚Äù, ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt work, it doesn‚Äôt work‚Äù, ‚Äúand just don't do that promised. "  Right?  Seems Yes.  But! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Where is your tolerance and loyalty to the resource on which you spend / spent so much time?  Where is the basic patience and faith that everything will work out?  Is it necessary to behave like little children who need everything at once?  Do you really think that having started such a big deal, the developers of Habr stopped on their laurels and are sitting and spitting at the ceiling?  After all, it has been written many times that most of the changes and innovations are still ahead ... <br><br>  And what happens on the part of TM?  Everything is very simple.  Looking at this whole "cry of Yaroslavna", with a howl and ensemble, at the complete lack of loyalty on the part of a part of the community, anyone will become angry.  A lot of work, everything is done on the fly, and the community, in the face of well-known figures, leaves in packs for the reasons described above, and slamming the door last. <br><br>  In some cases, TM, in my opinion, bent a little when trying to restore order, but you can understand them - we all are not without sin. <br><br>  In general, you can describe the situation for a long time and at different angles.  And everyone will always be in his opinion.  So let's stop doing self-healing.  Let's take a timeout. <br><br>  All who are unhappy with something - they can just do something else besides Habr.  All who are satisfied - continue to calmly write / discuss articles and topics, and the developers will calmly take care of their business, without being distracted by the bickering.  You look and in a month the storm in the glass will calm down.  And all will be well.  As after the "disease". <br><br>  Epilogue: I would like to clarify that this topic was written by me with the sole purpose - to try to establish a kind of status quo, in which everyone will be busy with their work for a certain time, and then look at the results, what has changed. <br><br>  Habra does not need revolutions, cleansing, a change of elite, and so on.  Habr needs development.  From which all will benefit.  So let's provide it. <br><br>  ZY  And yes, I almost forgot.
