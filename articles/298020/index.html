According <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2016/01/19/624512-rashodi-na-it-mire-rekordno-upali-na-56">to</a> Vedomosti, this is 5.6% lower than the same indicator for the year before last.  The vice president of research, John-David Lovelock, associates cost cutting with the strengthening of the national American currency.  The latest report of the company allows you to look at the figures for 2015 and get forecasts of specialists for the new year. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The least affected were the data center market, where last year's costs amounted to about $ 73 billion.  The most successful server manufacturers can consider the third quarter of 2015, when global shipments of products increased by 9.2% compared with the total annual indicator, while revenue showed an increase of 7.5%.  The most impressive statistics recorded in the Asian market, where shipments increased by almost a quarter.  At the same time, Gartner analysts are expecting the further development of the data center market, waiting for the excess of $ 75 billion in 2016. <br><br>  In one of the key segments of the market - IT services - there was a decrease in expenses by 4.5%, even despite the increasing popularity of cloud solutions.  This year, the company expects costs at the level of 940 billion dollars, that is, 3% more than the figures received in 2014.  As IDC analyst Mikhail Popov notes, corporate clients increasingly prefer virtual terminals to traditional personal computers, which on average cost customers three times cheaper and at the same time ‚Äúlive‚Äù twice as long.  According to Popov, at present there is a migration of computing power to data centers.

      But the main segment of the IT-market, the company considers communication services.  Last year, expenses amounted to more than $ 1.5 trillion, this year Gartner analysts predict a slight decrease of 1.2% due to the abolition of roaming charges in the EU countries and some regions of the USA and Canada.  Even the growth of voice traffic and data transmission is not able to compensate for the reduced costs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b94/db7/4f9/b94db74f907745ab8f62ca8e48ac7135.png"><br><br>  If we talk about the IT markets of developing countries, which include Russia, in 2016, Gartner specialists expect spending at $ 326 billion, which is 5.3% more than last year.  According to a published report, in this situation, significant changes in politics and the economy prevent growth in costs.  Shamil Shakirova, President of Ay-Teko System Integrator, notes that the falling ruble rate had a huge impact on the Russian market, because prices for most of the equipment and software supplied are set in US dollars.  As a result, customers are looking for alternative development paths, buying IT services and renting computing power.  Thus, customers adapt to the organization's activities in the conditions of economic crisis. <br><br>  In general, if you believe the forecasts of the company Gartner, expenses in IT will grow in the new year will grow only by 0.6%, and the world level of two years ago will be achieved only by 2019. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298020/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298020/</a></p>
