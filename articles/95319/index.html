    <h4>  Education 1.0 </h4><br>  Our vocational education system is seriously ill.  So much has been written about this that I have nothing to add. <br><br>  In my humble opinion, which was recently released, the main problem is the lack of stimulus and self-stimulation (not to be confused with masochism).  The version of ‚Äúoutdated educational programs‚Äù is too jaded and banal. <br><br><h4>  Education 1.5 </h4><br>  Teachers for the most part do not know how or do not want to attract students to their classes.  To listen to dry lectures is boring and unbearable.  It is not interesting to perform strange laboratory instructions.  Practical classes for some reason often turn into theoretical ones.  The consequence of all this is milk foam theory in the head and a mass copy-paste practice, which is filled up with teaching and departments of all specialties. <br><br><h4>  Education 1.9 </h4><br>  Do not like it - do not eat.  Self-education has not been canceled.  Some teachers even try to justify their teaching with the phrase ‚Äúthe university teaches learning‚Äù.  It seems to me that the phrase is true in a slightly different sense, not the one that is invested in it. <br><br>  So, self-education.  Perfect education.  But here, not everything is so smooth: there is human laziness.  The easiest way to overcome laziness - an inevitable incentive. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Education 2.0 </h4><br>  Why is our time - time of self-education?  We have internet.  Not just the Internet, but the Internet, filled with a huge amount of information suitable for learning (here everyone can remember many educational Internet sites, various online courses and think of a giant orange ice cream. A giant ice cream will help you remember this post).  Who needs to go to some remote building every day in order to get some useful knowledge with a very low probability?  Diploma.  A diploma is an incentive.  Incentive, sufficient for any passing exams, but not enough for constant attendance and fulfillment of everything. <br><br>  Often I had to hear "if I had been paid money, I would have studied."  Money is a good incentive.  But who can pay you to study hard?  Parents?  Well, maybe you're lucky, and then stop reading this.  Who do you still need nafig?  There is such a person. <br><br>  This person is yourself.  Pay yourself - why not. <br><br><h4>  Education 2.1 </h4><br>  ‚ÄúHe promised to share an idea, but he himself bears some kind of evidence‚Äù - you will think and you will be right.  Actually, the idea. <br><br>  Site for self-education with self-stimulation.  Regular text and video courses online (self-education), for passing the exams for which you must pay yourself (self-stimulation).  This is short.  Next in steps. <br><br><br><h5>  I want to start learning </h5><br>  You register on the site, choose the course you need.  Each course has a ‚Äúcost‚Äù.  Starting the chosen course, this cost is deducted from your account (a somewhat incorrect word is ‚Äúwritten off‚Äù, but this will become clear later).  You yourself can choose the cost of the course, but there is a minimum. <br><br><h5>  What is the course today? </h5><br>  Courses are divided into stages, at the end of each stage - a small test.  The test may not be a test as such, it all depends on the type of training (more on that again later).  Anyway, for the successful completion of each test at your expense (oh, a miracle!) Returns a portion of the "cost" of the course.  Thus, if you want to return almost the entire cost of the course, you need to pass all exams. <br><br><h5>  What kind of fool would pay then? </h5><br>  A fool who does not want to be such anymore.  I do not undertake to discuss the psychological aspects of such a scheme of education at a professional level, but for some reason it seems to me that there are quite a few people who are ready to learn this way. <br><br><h5>  And the money in my account? </h5><br>  Money can not be withdrawn (with this one can argue, I am not strong in monetization).  They can be used as collateral (here is a more appropriate word instead of ‚Äúcost‚Äù) for other courses, after which it can be returned again with a successful surrender and mortgage again.  When everyone is tired, they can be purchased, for example, useful literature on the topic of the course, or, at worst, a certificate of completion of the course.  Well, or something like that. <br><br><h5>  Oh well.  Where is the profit? </h5><br>  A small part of the cost of the course immediately goes to the owners of the service.  Part of this part is the teachers (about them below).  In addition, the option "say thank you" is available, which allows you to transfer the entire current account to the owners of the service. <br><br><h5>  Something said about the type of training ... </h5><br>  The student chooses who he will learn from before starting the course.  There are 3 types of teachers: <br><ul><li>  Professional - a specialist in his courses, selected by the owner of the service, he has a higher minimum amount of collateral and a higher percentage of tuition fees. </li><li>  Amateur - standard pledge and interest, but the competence may be lower.  Although it may actually be higher, there is a risk here. </li><li>  Newbie - works for free to become a Lover.  Pledge standard, the lowest percentage. </li></ul><br>  And what do they do?  Professionals can communicate quite tightly with a student during their studies, and instead of tests, they can offer written exams or practical tasks.  Lovers, in general, can also.  The main duty of all teachers is to ensure that the student does not miss something important.  This means checking the test results, pointing out weak points and advising what and where to read / listen / see.  In general, to guide the true path. <br><br>  I do not know how to select Professional teachers, but I don‚Äôt have a business plan here either. <br><br>  Any site member who has successfully completed several courses in his specialty (for example, web programming), has trained a number of students on the site and has passed the Professional test can become an amateur.  There is another incentive: after some time you can start earning.  Not so much money, but nice. <br><br>  To become a Newbie, you just have to complete your course and test Amateur. <br><br>  We impose a system of reviews / rating / karma for self-regulation and self-purification for all this nonsense, you can still spice it up with trendy social features, but everything else is to your taste. <br><br><h4>  Total </h4><br>  For those who do not like to read a lot of letters, scrolling to the end, in short: <br><ul><li>  The student makes a deposit for passing examinations.  I passed the exam - get some money back, did not pass - teach the materiel or forget about the money. </li><li>  Money in the account can be reused for a deposit.  The better you study, the less money you make.  For one small amount with a successful scenario, you can take a lot of courses. </li><li>  The level of the teacher can be chosen.  The better the teacher, the more bail, the greater the percentage of site owners. </li><li>  You can begin to teach yourself, and after some time, and get paid for it at all. </li><li>  Once the introduced funds can no longer be withdrawn in the form of money, but you can withdraw in the form of good books or certificates of graduation.  Or you can thank the authors of the site, transferring the remaining funds to them. </li></ul><br><h4>  Instead of epilogue </h4><br>  Usually they write something like ‚Äúwaiting for criticism and constructive,‚Äù but I hardly need it.  Rather, those who like this idea.  So criticism and constructive welcome.  But only in terms of the idea, and not the difficulties of technical implementation, the psychological and sociological aspects of teaching and learning. <br><br>  ps: I thought I would post it here or on the blog ‚ÄúTake the idea, I don't need it‚Äù (or whatever it's called).  In the end, he came to the conclusion that this idea is not very pulling, and that it is quite a conversation on the topic.  I apologize for the lengthy and muddled presentation. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/95319/">https://habr.com/ru/post/95319/</a></p>
