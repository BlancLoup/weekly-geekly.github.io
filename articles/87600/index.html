In many universities there is a faculty of distance education, which, as a rule, uses special software to ensure and facilitate the learning process.  Why, in these universities, do not use software to facilitate the process of full-time study?  A full-time study system (SOO) could save teachers from unnecessary paperwork, storing tons of paper students' reports, making lists of truants, rating, would give additional features such as: notifying students (newsletter, news, teacher‚Äôs blog), statistics by student / group / stream / month / year. <br>  So let's talk about full-time learning software ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Hello, <strong>Habr</strong> ! <br><br><h3>  Introduction </h3><br>  Since this is the first article I have, a few words about me instead of the preface: <br>  I am 21 years old, I live in the capital of Belarus, I work in the field of IT (php developer), officially 2 years, unofficially - 4. I study at the 5th (last) course, majoring in micro and nanoelectronics, in full-time and free-of-charge education.  He started his way as a samurai, started as a simple player of online games, having thoroughly studied all aspects of each game he played, went on to the next level - the administration of this game.  This is how the server appeared, on which I was a full-fledged admin, tired of answering players' questions, holding contests, etc.  - began writing game scripts with auto contests, again boring - engaged in improving the game site, and reached PHP, web programming, and began his working activity in a small IT office (hi Zenonis), where he began to read Habr, because many there , it is read (hello again).  Already for a long time I want to get an invite, but so far I haven‚Äôt succeeded in this, there were two attempts to write an article, but, going into the search on Habra, I was upset that similar articles were written before me and gave up.  He began to wait for the topic of the article to find me by itself, and this happened, and helped me in this, voluntarily-compulsory, my university.  After two weeks, my pre-diploma practice ends and I need to write what I have been doing for 3 months.  The topic of my diploma ‚ÄúInternet system for organizing education in the disciplines of micro- and nanoelectronics‚Äù, as you see, is not very connected with my specialty, but this is probably the only thing I can really do.  In this article I will describe the system to simplify the learning process, about software that will make learning optimized, interesting, will save the time of teachers and students. <br><br>  I started writing the system in December 2009 and I plan to finish the basic function by the summer of 2010. The name of the system so far is <u>‚ÄúEffective Learning System‚Äù</u> (SEF) and this is not a distance learning system (DLS), of which there are now many.  In many universities there is a faculty of distance learning, which, as a rule, uses special software to ensure and facilitate the learning process.  Why, in these universities, do not use software to facilitate the process of full-time study?  A full-time study system (SOO) could save teachers from unnecessary paperwork, storing tons of paper students' reports, making lists of truants, rating, would give additional features such as: notifying students (newsletter, news, teacher‚Äôs blog), statistics by student / group / stream / month / year. <br>  So let's talk about full-time learning software.  I will describe the system as I see it, and you write something that would be useful to implement in it yet.

    <h3>  SEF concept </h3><br>  <strong>1)</strong> A simple, intuitive system, almost anyone can understand it. <br>  <strong>2)</strong> Initially, it will be used within the same department of the university, and then the entire university.  (I try to foresee the possibilities of using within the whole university, but, taking into account the requirements of my diploma manager, I understand that the system should be super flexible, because all teachers have different teaching methods, starting with the grading system and ending with the control system). <br>  <strong>3)</strong> Very strong binding to the schedule and calendar of classes, the strong interaction of all objects of the system (courses-writing-calendar-students-attendance-control). <br>  <strong>4)</strong> Friendly interface, usefulness and relevance of information for students.  Information posted on the site will <u>indeed</u> be useful for students. <br>  <strong>5)</strong> Full automation.  The minimum of actions for teachers, everything that can occur automatically, in this mode will work. <br><br><h3>  System operation </h3><br>  The system can be divided into three communicating parts or three basic types of users: <u>administrators</u> , <u>teachers</u> and <u>students</u> .  It all starts with an admin. <br><br>  <strong>Administrator.</strong> <br><br>  Serves as a system customizer: <br><ul><li>  sets the training schedule (the start time of the couple and the time frame of the semesters); </li><li>  creates faculties, departments, specialties; </li><li>  sets x-point scoring system; </li><li>  sets access rights for all other types of users; </li><li>  adds teachers, students;  (students can add and teacher); </li><li>  fills teacher's schedule (the teacher can also do this); </li></ul><br><br>  As soon as the administrator has completed the initial system settings and added teachers, the teachers will take over. <br><br>  <strong>Teacher.</strong> <br><br>  <strong>1)</strong> <em>Courses</em> : <br><br>  Logging in, adds (if not already) students and proceeds to create their own courses.  The teacher can create various courses of various types (lectures, practical, laboratory), can attach files to courses, sign groups of students on them, write a list of literature of the course and its description.  Inside the course, the teacher creates classes, if, for example, he needs to read 32 hours of lectures, he creates 16 classes (pairs), to which he can also attach files, change the order of classes, or even combine them into sections. <br><br>  Inside the course there is a tab ‚ÄúControl‚Äù in which it can add a list of test questions with or without answers.  Interestingly, the courses are ‚Äúreusable‚Äù; it is not necessary to re-create them every year; it is enough to sign new groups for this course.  Over time, the content of the course will be informative, the teacher will add to the lesson / course / section of the training manual, additional materials, video and audio lessons, fill in the description of each lesson, so that the student will know exactly what he will know when he comes for a couple. <br><br>  <strong>2)</strong> <em>Schedule</em> : <br>  Further, the teacher proceeds to fill the schedule (if the administration did not do it for him).  Selects from the list, one of his courses, indicates which group will have a lesson and what days, weeks and time (by the way, in my university, the schedule is divided into weeks, there are four weeks of classes, which are repeated one after the other, for a period of of the year ).  The teacher fills the schedule for these 4 weeks, and it is put on the calendar, in which the lesson is calculated for each date, i.e.  looking at the calendar, you can see what work is coming (its name, files for it, etc.). <br><br>  At this point, the launch of the system is complete.  And it is ready for use.  Now I will describe the student how he behaves in the system. <br><br>  <strong>Student.</strong> <br><br>  You can log in to your profile on the site, see the list of your group (find out the middle names, contact numbers)  He sees his calendar with upcoming events (lectures, labs, etc.).  He sees what occupation he is waiting for, what he will hear there, find out, maybe download files for the lesson and prepare in advance (haha :)).  I think it would be convenient to print your schedule or calendar so that it is always at hand, in the absence of electronics with the Internet.  A student can look at his statistics, he can be terrified by his poor attendance, and come to his senses (again, ha ha :)).  Or see that he is not allowed to the next laboratory work and run to the dean's office to fill out papers for admission.  The student sees the news from his teachers, can read their blog, or find out that he must complete a quiz.  Practically nothing is required from the student in the system, for him it is basically just a convenient site with the necessary info and materials. <br><br>  So, imagine, time is running, the semester is in full swing, how will the system work in action? <br><br>  <strong>Teacher.</strong> <br><br>  <strong>3)</strong> <em>Visiting log</em> : <br>  He constantly fills the visiting journals, he needs to know how to evaluate students, who to drive on the exam, and who should be favored for good attendance.  After any activity has passed, a button appears in the calendar beside it - ‚ÄúVisiting Log‚Äù, by clicking on which, a list of the group (attached to the course in the schedule) with switches appears (was, was not, good reason).  In addition to the switches, there will be an input field for assessment if the student has distinguished himself, and the teacher will want to mark it.  Over time, statistics, schedules, reports will be generated for each student, group, and faculty. <br><br>  <strong>4)</strong> <em>Knowledge control</em> : <br>  The material has been read, now it is necessary to check the students, give them some marks.  The teacher comes to the appropriate tab "Control".  Select one of their groups, course, and type of control.  There are several types of control: a) in the form of a normal test, a list of questions with answers and a limited time (with such a test, everything happens automatically, the system gives a grade to the student);  b) in the form of a test with no answer choices (the teacher himself checks such work and makes a mark).  When a student is doing work, she is sent to the teacher and appears in his teaching department, he can check it, rate it, and send it back to the student with corrections (or everything happens automatically, depending on the type of control).  As a rule, knowledge control will be held in a computer class (not at home, it is not LMS!), Although the teacher has the right to set the student homework in this way. <br><br>  At the end of the semester, the teacher can open the statistics on the group / student, and estimate what to put on the exam, and how much to ask.  Do you think such systems have a place to live and be used in the future? <br><br><h3>  Completion </h3><br>  In conclusion, I want to say that most of the above described is already ready, and it remains to apply very little effort to obtain a high-quality, useful product that will be used (at least in my university)! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/87600/">https://habr.com/ru/post/87600/</a></p>
