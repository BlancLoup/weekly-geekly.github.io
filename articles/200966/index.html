In <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/Promwad/topics/">previous articles,</a> we honestly told you about the nuances associated with the design and manufacture of prototypes, with mass production, and now is the time to go to the questions that begin the development of design documentation (CD) and which determine the success of the relationship between the customer and the developer - creating a product concept and writing a technical assignment.  These are the first steps towards the release of complex serial devices and software (product). </p><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  Product development is a step-by-step process that requires in-depth knowledge and serious preliminary preparation.  Exclusion of individual phases of the project increases the risks and shifts them, as a rule, to the final stage of mass production.  And this, in turn, can significantly affect the growth of project costs, most often unforeseen (extrabudgetary).  Therefore, it is important to go through all the steps step by step (some of them can be repeated iteratively, this is the normal process of creating technically complex and competitive products). </p><br><p></p><br><p>  Here is a sample list of basic tasks for developing an electronic device: </p><br><ol><li>  Creating a product concept </li><li>  Technical and commercial development </li><li>  Electronic device development </li><li>  Assembly and verification of prototypes of products </li><li>  Preparation for production and release of the installation batch </li><li>  Serial production </li><li>  Warranty and after-sales service </li></ol><br><p>  Today we will look at the first two points, and the remaining phases of the process will be covered in the following articles. </p><br><p></p><br><h4>  1. Creating a product concept </h4><br><p>  It is at this stage that the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa new device takes the shape of a commercially successful product.  There is an assessment of competitors and the compilation of a comparative table - technical level maps (KTU).  The choice of the optimal combination of functional and technical characteristics of the product and the business model of the entire project is determined. </p><br><p></p><br><p>  Technical experts develop a technical and commercial proposal and concept design of the product with a description of its advantages and functional features.  At the same time, business analysts create a business plan.  At this stage, additional marketing research, search for investments and other activities can be carried out, the main purpose of which is to get as close as possible to the reality ‚Äúpicture‚Äù of the product life cycle. </p><br><p></p><br><p>  The product concept may contain the following information: </p><br><ul><li>  Functional description of the device and the description of tasks </li><li>  Technical description of the device </li><li>  Description of performance </li><li>  Preliminary sketches and / or photorealistic images of the device </li><li>  Marketing plan with description: </li></ul><br><ol><li>  Direct and functional device competitors </li><li>  Target audience </li><li>  Markets and dependencies </li><li>  Typical use cases </li><li>  Estimated Business Model </li></ol><br><p>  <b>The results of the stage</b> : a technical-commercial proposal for the development of the device, as well as a package of documents reflecting the concept of the product (it may slightly change at subsequent stages). </p><br><p></p><br><h4>  2. Technical and commercial product development </h4><br><p>  At this stage, the developers answer the question "how will the product be implemented?".  A draft design is created, the device architecture is being selected.  A technical assignment (TOR) is being developed, specifications are being created, and examples of product usage are being analyzed. </p><br><p></p><br><p>  As a rule, the main characteristics of the device are already laid down in the business plan, and at the level of the TOR a more detailed technical study of the product takes place.  This is a universal document, and although in Russia it is regulated by state standards, the developer can adapt it to the needs of a specific project. </p><br><p></p><br><p>  In some cases, development can begin with TK.  For example, when a modification of a finished device is required, or a revision of products within an existing line, or a customer‚Äôs budget does not allow starting a project from the stage of consulting and developing a business plan.  Then it is TK that becomes the first and main document describing the future product. </p><br><p></p><br><p>  In any case, the TK is not just a formal annex No. 1 to the contract.  For device developers, this document is the starting point for planning and executing well-defined tasks.  For the customer, this is a vision of the goal and a list of criteria for evaluating the finished product and acceptance of work.  It is TK that becomes the basis for effective interaction without controversial issues and misunderstandings.  It is imperative that the customer and the developer have a common vision of the development process and the expected end result. </p><br><p></p><br><p>  Good practice - the most detailed description of the goals and objectives of the project, drawing up a list of the functionality of the device, fixing upcoming work in the development of software and hardware platforms, determining the scope of the search design solutions, an indication of all the necessary requirements for the future device.  Technical specialists are involved in the preparation of TZ with the participation of a customer representative, in some cases users of a future product may be involved. </p><br><p></p><br><p>  In the process of preparing the technical specifications: </p><br><ul><li>  Specify prices for electronic components </li><li>  Sign non-disclosure agreements (NDA) with component base manufacturers for additional technical information </li><li>  Base components are selected. </li><li>  There is a preliminary calculation of the cost of the product (BOM), taking into account the cost of production in different series </li></ul><br><p>  At the start of development, it is not always clear how to implement certain functions, more detailed information appears at subsequent stages, especially with regard to software development.  The TK is a living working document, the scope of tasks in it can be adjusted and refined, this will affect the project cost estimate, so it is important to foresee the format for making changes (usually this is done in the form of additions describing the old and new TK edition). </p><br><p></p><br><p>  Terms of writing TK depend on the objectives of the project.  If this is the development of a typical device with a known set of functions, then the first version of the document on the hardware can be obtained in a week, and it will take about two weeks to prepare the task for the software part. </p><br><p></p><br><p>  In some cases, the customer prepares the TZ independently, then the developer needs only to analyze and evaluate the project.  This greatly facilitates and accelerates the preparation of commercial proposals, as well as reduces the need for additional communication.  Moreover, a ready TK allows the customer to apply with his project to a number of companies and then select the optimal contractor on the basis of received offers (assessing his competence with the help of clarifying questions). </p><br><p></p><br><p>  <b>The result of this stage</b> is a coordinated from both sides TK for the development of a device with a specific architecture and software and hardware platform. </p><br><p></p><br><p>  We hope our advice will help you in developing the concept of a new product and in writing a technical task, as well as in building an open and productive relationship with the performer. </p><br><br>  <b>PS</b> <a href="http://promwad.ru/sites/default/files/publications/promwad_scope-statement-example.pdf">An example of the content of the</a> technical requirements for the development of a <a href="http://promwad.ru/sites/default/files/publications/promwad_scope-statement-example.pdf">turnkey device</a> - under this link you can open / download the typical content of the technical specifications for the development of electronics with a description of the hardware platform, software, design and housing design.  This document can be adapted for a specific project and draw up on its basis a detailed technical description for the phased development of a new turnkey device. </div>
