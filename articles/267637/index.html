Fortunately, there are not so many of them - the majority still take orders and transactions in it, lead customers, set tasks and reminders, call.  But the additional "features" of the company really do not use, while many of the leading CRM of the Russian market have something to learn. <br><br> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/267637/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/adf/52e/02a/adf52e02a28b46a18419ecec5e6d6f67.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#120a8f">Why do CRM developers know what a business needs?</font> </h2><br>  Today, the CRM market has grown to incredible proportions.  If in 2008 it was possible to list the names of the systems that were known to you on the fingers of one hand, then today it is enough to enter the ‚ÄúCRM‚Äù in the search for Yandex.Direct to begin to fill you with hundreds of suggestions: from simple electronic notebooks to really clever systems.  Naturally, in this market there are experts and newcomers who decide to rise on the wave of popularity.  The latter, in turn, are also different: someone forks popular open source projects like Sugar CRM and earns on customization and customization, while others invest only in marketing, with a couple of inert tables, forms and graphs behind it.  Of course, it is not necessary to wait from their systems of expertise.  Meanwhile, it is the CRM vendor company that should be the carrier of maximum business expertise. <br><br>  Developers of serious CRM, like any corporate system, are always more than programmers.  First of all, they are faced with the task of selling their product, and therefore, leading the entire transaction process in their own system.  So they are not just testers with a developed test plan, but end users and implement all the needs of a sales person, marketing specialist, head of department and company into the system.  Secondly, they constantly face requests and requests for revision, which also serve as sources of ideas and form the basis for the development and implementation of the requested functionality.  That is why a reasonable attention to the logic of the CRM-system itself can serve as a hint for changing existing business processes.

      CRM does not just serve for accounting, the right system can contribute to the formation of a so-called portfolio of prospects and long-term potential opportunities.  You can consider the example of the same CRM.  Suppose there is a possibility of renting the system and the client took advantage of it - it is convenient for him to make small payments at a specific point in time.  He is not ready to purchase licenses and their purchase is a long-term potential opportunity.  If the CRM correctly fix the point of interaction with such a client, you can come to the sale.  A CRM will remind you when it is worth talking to a customer about an upcoming purchase. <br><br>  Finally, do not forget that CRM is software, and therefore has certain properties that greatly facilitate the operational work in the company: <br><br><ul><li>  is an add-on to the database, and therefore data can be protected and difficult to corrupt through a graphical user interface (GUI) <br><br></li><li>  has a logical and well-developed hierarchy - the manager can simply enter the necessary data based on the logic of the system <br><br></li><li>  customizable (with varying degrees of advancement) - you can customize both the system as a whole and the profile of each user <br><br></li><li>  allows you to create reminders, alerts, business processes, cyclical tasks, which are designed to facilitate the work of the manager and to establish coordination within the company <br><br></li><li>  integrates with external accounting and telephony systems - the company receives integrated automation, the center of which becomes CRM. </li></ul><br>  The key word in the understanding of CRM-systems is ‚Äúautomation‚Äù.  It is designed to streamline processes, build relationships and keep records of customers and technology-based transactions - clearly, efficiently, quickly and structured.  That is why a well-implemented implementation gives the company the opportunity to expand at the expense of partially freed up labor and temporary resources. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#120a8f">CRM goes beyond just CRM</font> </h2><br>  Since CRM abroad is developing longer than in Russia, the accumulated experience provides more accurate figures that are increasingly suited to the situation in the domestic development of customer and sales management systems.  Here is such an interesting statistic found on <a href="https://salesloft.com/resources/blog/2013/09/crm-stats-good-bad-ugly-infographic">SalesLoft</a> : <br><br><ul><li>  40% CRM sold by SaaS model </li><li>  35% of users admitted that they enter data into information systems manually, while integration with CRM is provided </li><li>  43% of CRM customers are aware that they use less than half of the system‚Äôs capabilities </li><li>  72% of users are ready to exchange all the highly valued functionality for the ease of use of a CRM system. </li></ul><br>  In fact, CRM increase functionality, which is often not used by anyone.  One of the reasons is ignorance about the capabilities of the system.  Let's try to make a list of features that many users did not know and therefore did not want to ask. <br><br>  <b>CRM - a system for working with the client before and after the sale.</b>  Even with the most hopeless.  Think of a client card not as a data set or a piece of data, but as an account you need to work with: mailings, individual offers, additional sales.  If you look at the popular CRM, then you can see that in younger systems, such as <a href="http://amocrm.com/">amoCRM</a> or <a href="http://www.freshoffice.ru/">FreshOffice,</a> customer cards include a small number of fields, and for experienced market players ( <a href="http://www.terrasoft.ru/">Terrasoft</a> (especially the old desktop), <a href="http://regionsoft.ru/">Clic</a> , <a href="http://regionsoft.ru/">Regionsoft CRM</a> ), the cards are not just a lot of fields, but also contain tabs.  In the end, with all the visible interface congestion, it is the second option that makes it possible not only to fix the phone-name-email, but to initially create a real client profile.  If necessary, the extra fields, by the way, can be disabled.  The presence of such a profile makes it possible to collect as much information as possible and on its basis to manage the segments of leads and customers, initiate additional sales and return those who are dissatisfied and refused.  Remember - if you have not sold, it does not mean that you have lost a client - develop love and trust in the brand in it. <br><br>  <b>When working with a CRM system, think ahead for expansion.</b>  Often, vendors talk about the fact that ‚Äúalien‚Äù clients come to them: that is, the company bought CRM at the time of five employees, then grew, started a sales department, increased its customer base and realized that their CRM system was not developed and became is small.  The decision comes to move to another CRM - and this is money, problems associated with adapting to the new interface, plus technical issues of database portability.  Typically, vendors easily transfer the database, but it is better to follow a different pattern: first buy the initial version of the program, and then expand on its base.  An example of how older and younger editions are organized, varying in functionality, can be seen on the sites of almost all developers of CRM systems. <br><br>  <b>Personalize your work with clients in the CRM system</b> - you know not only the name, but also the events that must be recorded by the managers.  Tie yourself to customers with this knowledge.  In some areas, personalization increases conversion by 42%.  Moreover, personalization is not only and not so much an appeal to the client by name, but above all - personal recommendation.  Create the narrowest segments, group clients with filters, send CRM mailings to the created clusters - this will increase customer loyalty, followed by profitability.  Created customer clusters are nothing but parameters that shape the sales environment.  In combination with a comparison of the plan and the fact of sales by clusters, you can greatly change the overall strategy of behavior in the market and get new sources of customers / leads, see the points of growth of profitability. <br><br>  <b>To keep a customer and get his pre</b> - <b>sale</b> is always cheaper than attracting a new one.  Conduct micromarketing campaigns based on previous orders and orders that are in CRM.  If you come up with the mind, it will bear fruit.  For example, a good case with a car: a client bought a small cargo van from you in the spring, it was summer and it started to rain.  You can offer all customers from the base in CRM, who bought a car, protective awnings or winter tires.  The client can sometimes not even guess about his needs - shape it as it suits you.  For the purpose of pre-sales, it is important to take into account every interaction - every manager should be aware that all interactions must be recorded in CRM.  So you will always have a complete picture of the relationship with the client.  Selective fixation of events will certainly lead to an inaccurate idea that, in the context of the chosen automation strategy, is a serious management blunder. <br><br>  <b>Store in the CRM system the data of technical support, help desk, service:</b> if your new product solves old problems or closes previously unmet needs, notify the customer about this by calling or sending out.  Show the desire to solve problems - a proactive interest in customers, repeated calls and letters will increase loyalty (follow-up). <br><br>  Today, many CRMs have become a full-fledged tool for small call centers, however, they implement it in different ways: <a href="http://www.terrasoft.ru/">bpm'online</a> at the expense of specialized CRM, <a href="http://www.amocrm.com/">amocrm</a> - at the expense of additional paid telephony widgets, desktop <a href="http://www.regionsoft.ru/">Clic</a> and <a href="http://www.regionsoft.ru/">RegionSoft</a> - at the expense of embedded softphones and integration with powerful free virtual PBX Asterisk.  All you need is integration with telephony and a very good habit of managers to enter information into CRM. <br><br>  Salesforce conducted research, according to which 85% of customers are dissatisfied with talking on the phone.  But the phone today is not only cold calls.  Using client history in CRM helps to bring each call to another level. <br><br>  <b>Collect feedback, survey</b> - this is not only a base for management decisions, but also a great opportunity to use data on satisfaction for presenting new clients.  In this case, directly from CRM, you can send customers letters or SMS with gratitude for the appeal and the result of work on it.  Especially great it will work in an unexpected area: one thing, if the review will thank the store Ozon, and the other - a supplier of building materials or an advertising agency.  You can appeal to both positive and negative customer experience to show how you are able to solve problems.  By the way, if you bring in clients' wishes and claims in CRM, you can know exactly who and what to offer based on the results of changes in the product. <br><br>  <b>CRM is able to stimulate your employees.</b>  I think that the vendors themselves have repeatedly encountered procrastination and laziness, because in almost all top systems, except for planners and calendars, there is something that controls employees.  For example, in <a href="http://www.terrasoft.ru/">bpm'online</a> you can see the sales funnel by employees and departments, in <a href="http://www.bmicro.ru/">Clic</a> - calculate salary and KPI, in <a href="http://www.regionsoft.ru/">RegionSoft</a> - see the effectiveness of the manager, calculate KPI, display the progress bar to achieve goals.  If there is an opportunity to display the activities of a group of managers, you can contribute a competitive moment: whose progress bar / ruler / funnel will come to the cherished 100% faster for the month?  In addition, there are some good add-ons on the market that can be integrated with CRM through the API and more precisely monitor the activities of employees.  Although, in my opinion, there are enough basic features in CRM. <br><br>  <b>CRM can help in presentations.</b>  In many companies, especially those with a branch structure, the arrival of management or a large meeting turn into a panic: figures are collected from disparate sources, graphs are constructed, and data is adjusted.  If all the information is correctly entered into the CRM-system, then you can easily build the necessary tables, samples and graphs.  Even if CRM is weak in terms of colorful reporting, the collected data can be imported into Excel and processed as you need. <br><br>  The listed possibilities are also only a part of the whole iceberg.  These are small and practically necessary solutions for all that exist in CRM systems.  In addition to them, virtually every vendor has industry-specific capabilities, additional development for managing integrations, APIs, configurators, and so on.  If you approach the implementation from the beginning seriously, to carry out a thorough setup and preparation, then CRM will not only lead to greater manageability of the client base, but also save time and nerves.  Which, as you know, can not buy. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/267637/">https://habr.com/ru/post/267637/</a></p>
