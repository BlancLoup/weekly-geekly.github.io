    <h5>  Accounting </h5><br>  There he is simple to disgrace! <br>  Naturally, the easiest way is to hire an accountant.  If on trifles, then (as far as I remember) you can find a freelancer for about $ 1000 a month.  Naturally, a lot depends on the amount of work, qualifications, certificates, and so on. <br>  There is just an accountant, and there is a CPA - a certified public accountant.  These are the types of our auditors 8-) and, among other things, they can represent the office in a dispute with the state, they themselves sign your statements and guarantee that you will have all the type-top.  They are measured by the amount of liability insurance to the client for errors.  Well, in general, it's cool and expensive, I did not personally check it. <br>  However, the actual accounting is available even for the complete profane, to which I belong.  Yes, of course, a normal qualified boo, before or in the process of accounting, probably would have managed to turn things around so that taxes would have to be paid less.  However, the use of such a high-precision and expensive laser gun on our half-dead village sparrows does not make economic sense ... <br>  That is why I started my account in QuickBooks Online, I pay $ 12.95 per month (with a card, each time - see the previous article) and I don‚Äôt blow it.  I have a few operations, a dozen (maximum two) per month, because I easily clog it all up, receiving a weekly reminder from my planner.  I spend on the strength of half an hour a week. <br>  The program allows you to set invoices.  By the way, there, in America, the phrase ‚Äúnice and professionally looking invoices‚Äù is for some reason considered necessary in advertising any nonsense for small business.  Everywhere - from accounting software to client banks and payment systems.  Such a passing business at all.  The main problem is the invoice to print 8-) they would try to shuffle our mountains of documents back and forth ... <br>  Well, okay. <br><br>  In general, everything is organized obviously.  If you sold something to someone - it does not matter, goods or services - you get an invoice for a client.  the client has a debt, you have an asset.  if you bought something from someone, write a check!  From the bank account (or not in the bank, you can also take into account expenses from your pocket, although I don‚Äôt use it), the amount of the check is written off, voila. <br>  In principle, it is possible to connect the accounting program directly to the bank-client, and the bank is processed in (semi) automatic mode.  However, this operation in the forehead is not carried out, it seems like it‚Äôs not the cheapest to take a QB Online account, and the bank also has to pay something for the service - in short, for me again there‚Äôs no economic sense.  I will hammer my heels of checks into the accounting department, and then I will scatter the money in the client bank with my hands. <br>  If the client has paid money for some kind of invoice - accept the payment.  Money falls on the account, invoice (or invoices, if there is a lot of money) are extinguished.  You can see the parameters of the company, a bunch of reports of all sorts, and so.  this is again unnecessary for us, except for the moment when the tax reporting begins. <br>  All this economy can then be edited, I used it several times, following the instructions of the accountant, in order to optimize taxes 8-) In general, the program and the accounting principles themselves are simple as a door, they do not pose any difficulty even for a non-professional. <br><br><h5>  Taxes </h5><br>  I really want to write a banal about ‚Äúthe inevitability of two things,‚Äù but I will not. <br>  If only because I personally had the impression that it is quite possible there to tax and just avoid it.  All my experience with the fiscal and legal system of the states says that Russian fraudsters who make hundreds of millions of frauds in the US is no accident because 8-) <br>  Well, the very first link on the local tax website of a state to the ‚ÄúTaxpayer Rights Bill‚Äù, where there are 200 pages of taxpayer rights, and not a word about the IRS rights, after native aspen, it is somewhat shocking.  Yes, I have long hatched out of pink diapers, alas, and I fully understand that if anything - <i>it</i> will grind me away, but even if such state aspirations remain mostly at the level of declarations - it still warms the soul. <br>  Well, it's time to go home to the sheep. <br>  After registering with the IRS and receiving an EIN, confirmation must be sent to the address of the company.  This is just an envelope, in it one leaf and a couple of booklets.  The sheet is printed (typewriter font on a typewriter! Although it looks like a laser. 8- looks very authentic and stylish) confirmation of the assignment of an EIN and it is written when and what kind of reporting should be submitted to the IRS.  In my case, this is Form 1120 (Federal Income Tax) and the date is 03/15 / 20XX.  A valuable paper, though not an emblem, I wouldn‚Äôt like to love it, therefore, once again - when registering, pay attention to the reachability of your American address!  I do not know how - even send yourself a letter to check how the mail jumps, that everything is greased everywhere and the wheels are spinning ... <br><br>  Booklets are EFTPS ads, a federal tax payment system.  It is free.  The thing is that there the office cannot just take it so stupid and transfer the tax to the US Treasury.  You must first <s>declare the game</s> to get authorization for it.  Previously, all taxpayers were given FTD Coupons, this is a book with coupons that you had to somehow apply to the payments.  Dregs, in short.  Now there is another option - you can register in this federal online system and create something like a coupon online at your discretion. <br>  Since I have neither profits nor taxes, I did not fight.  But I do not exclude such a possibility in the future.  And at the moment, the principle of reasonable sufficiency widely used by me in life (as the reader, probably, has already managed to notice myself) dictated the choice of the third way to pay tax - stupid to send a check.  This is where the checkbook received in the bank comes in handy. <br>  But I ran ahead, first you need to calculate this tax and fill out the forms. <br>  I fully admit that the true Aryans easily sbatsayut it themselves.  But personally to me - laziness.  I do not like to do this.  And the price does not look very heavy - the last time I paid for this dregs (and my own peace of mind) $ 350.  I think it was worth it.  If someone thinks wrong, there are no problems, the market is full of programs like TurboTax or QuickBooks in the ‚ÄúReporting‚Äù version, which allow you to fill out forms yourself.  They cost 25 bucks as I remember.  But - all the responsibility on their shoulders.  And that where you can write off - also have to decide independently ... In short, everyone decides for himself. <br><br>  I chose an accountant for quite some time.  Then I still thought that everything was much more complicated than it turned out to be, I had a lot of questions.  They had to ask someone, the registrar refused to help me.  Therefore, I primitively went to the yellow pages, wrote out from there a bunch of addresses (dozens) of various accountants and consultants, and wrote to everyone.  About the same.  Outlined his tasks, problems, and for the seed - a couple of simple questions.  Less than half answered, meaningful answers turned out to be less than 10. I talked to them more closely.  The person who, with further communication, seemed the most sane and managed to dispel most of the fog in my head, and already got a contract, if you can call it that. <br><br>  Once a year, somewhere a month before the date specified in the letter (you can at least January 2, of course, but - all in Russian, until thunder breaks out ...) I send to the accountant Profit and Loss Report and Balance Sheet.  These reports are made in a couple of clicks in QuickBooks.  Then, within about a week, we agree on the layout for cost items, if there are any doubts, we finish all expenses that are not accepted by local standards because I usually forget about them (like, I paid here from my pocket for sending a declaration in the US ), as a result, the very Form 1120 comes out - with a dozen pages.  It must be signed and sent by express / registered mail somewhere to the American gullies (it seems to be in the state of Utah).  I use (hell, advertising) Pony Express. <br><br>  As I wrote earlier, there are only two main taxes related to a company such as our ‚Äúsemi-offshore‚Äù IT office: Income tax in its federal part and Sales / Use tax is already local. <br>  Since we do not sell anything tangible (weighty, rough or visible), a solid code, or even access to information in general, is not interested in sales tax.  And thank gods. <br><br>  Profit tax is paid from profit.  if it is.  and taking into account losses of past years. <br>  And this 2011 is the same year yes!  - turned out to be our first profitable.  Even with the loss of previous years.  So - formed a tax.  The accountant struggled for a long time trying to squeeze some more out of me.  ‚ÄúWell, didn‚Äôt they even buy a laptop?‚Äù, And so on in the same vein.  I regretted not taking these facts into account again, honestly 8-) However, I even wondered how it was that I should pay taxes to Uncle Sam? <br>  And now - the result.  534 dollars 00 cents.  I think very godly, with a turnover of under 200,000 for services.  From the declared profit came out less than 10%. <br>  And now we take a checkbook, write a check on the US Treasury for $ 534, attach it to the declaration and send it to the IRS.  Pony for it takes something about one and a half thousand rubles.  And wait.  Somewhere in a week, a line appears in the client bank stating that the check has been redeemed.  That's all tax paid.  I will not say that I began to sleep much calmer, but something is still there. <br><br>  As a result, the entire reporting campaign required quite a bit of time and effort from me.  He wrote about a dozen letters, printed simple forms once, which did not even have to be edited by hand, so that they fit on a sheet and the entire text was readable, filled out a check, went to the post office and sent it.  More precisely, even the courier went to the post office.  Yes, the mail is significantly more expensive than the Post of Russia, but the smut is much smaller.  And it goes faster. <br><br>  It seems that I have already dried up in the presentation of this topic.  If there are any unlit questions - prompt. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/140963/">https://habr.com/ru/post/140963/</a></p>
