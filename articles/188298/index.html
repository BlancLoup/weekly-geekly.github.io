  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The book about Ilya Segalovich</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Friends, <br>  July 28 Ilya Segalovich died, perhaps one of the most extraordinary people.  He was a talented leader, an expert in technology, but most importantly, he was the kindest person with a firm attitude.  I happened to know him personally, unfortunately not very long.  A little more than a year ago, we, with him and other colleagues, did the project "Web Monitor", about which I <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/141515/">wrote</a> earlier. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/869/5cd/059/8695cd059bc92f93bab0995142324a18.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      A few days ago I had a thought - to make a book of memories about this man.  The format of the book is an article by colleagues, friends and close people about the most, albeit insignificant at first glance, moments of his life.  I can not say that I am a great writer, but I wrote down <a href="http://alec-c4.com/blog/2013/07/28/ushel-iz-zhizni-Ilia-Segalovich/">my memories</a> in my blog - I suppose that I suppose to include approximately the same format of the article in the book. <br><br>  I plan to send all the proceeds from the sale of the book to the <a href="http://www.mariaschildren.ru/">Maria's Children Foundation</a> , which is overseen by Ilya's family.  In order to make it convenient for you to comment, I have decided to issue some issues related to the release of the book in the form of sub-paragraphs, so when commenting, please refer to them: <br><br>  1. To write a book you need a strong team.  I can not boast of writing talents, so I would like to Habravchane who can act as layout designers, designers, writers, editors, proofreaders, promoters, etc. involved in the project.  You will also need translators who can translate the book into other languages. <br><br>  2. It is planned to release not only the paper, but also the electronic version of the book.  I previously plan to distribute the electronic version via leanpub, maybe someone will be able to offer a better option. <br><br>  3. Regarding the release of the paper version of the book, I negotiated with Mann, Ivanov and Farber; in my opinion, they accepted the idea without much enthusiasm, maybe they have their own plans to produce a similar book.  At least I was told that they do not know to whom this book could be interesting.  If you and your friends would buy such a book - please mark it :) Also, perhaps you will have your own thoughts - who could have released such a book on paper. <br><br>  4. If you worked with Ilya, were friends with him or crossed paths on a project, send your stories.  They will be brought in the general piggy bank and gradually chapters of the book will be formed from them.  Also - send your photos and video materials, they can be included in the electronic version of the book. <br><br>  Add.  references: <br>  The page of the future book in facebook - <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ilya-Segalovich-Book/1399981603555214">www.facebook.com/pages/Ilya-Segalovich-Book/1399981603555214</a> <br><br>  UPD: A proposal has been received to launch a fundraising for the release of the book on Boomstarter.  Do you think it makes sense? <br><br>  PS: By the way, you can help the foundation ‚ÄúChildren of Mary‚Äù without waiting for the release of the book - <a href="http://mariaschildren.ru/content/view/8/10/">mariaschildren.ru/content/view/8/10</a> <br><br>  PPS: Article will be updated. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/188298/">https://habr.com/ru/post/188298/</a></p>
