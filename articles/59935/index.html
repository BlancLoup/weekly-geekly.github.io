  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Does microblogging replace traditional blogging?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Twitter's boom is gaining momentum.  The growth of thousands of percent, which was <a href="http://www.cybersecurity.ru/news/68097.html">recorded by</a> research companies, is accompanied not only by mass registration of ordinary users on this service.  It seems that Twitter will soon be able to boast the largest base of "star" accounts - famous people who not only registered there, but also write something from time to time. <br><br>  For many years, which I, if I may say so, have been studying the web, I don‚Äôt remember a single service that would gain so much popularity.  And even the notorious boom of blogging and the blogosphere of 2003‚Äì2004 cannot even compare closely with Twitter-mania.  Of course, then there were fewer users, and they were less experienced, and less used to working with online as a tool, and online services were still emerging as a class. <br><br>  However, what is the secret of Twitter boomers?  I'll try to determine. <a name="habracut"></a>

      <b>- Twitter is easy to use.</b> <br><br>  The minimalism of the settings that experienced users can complain to on Twitter has played in the favor of beginners and those who do not like to delve into the service for a long time.  Register and write, you do not need anything more.  Although I am an adept LJ, but I admit that on Twitter everything is several orders of magnitude simpler.  In general, it should be so.  Microblogging with microtune. <br><br>  <b>- Twitter is available to all</b> <br><br>  This service can be called the most democratic blog hosting.  In 140 characters you can‚Äôt demonstrate your literary explorations, you can't flinch with writing talent.  There is not so noticeable advantage of people who work with the word professionally.  The advantage that, in general, is felt on other blogger platforms <br><br>  <b>- Twitter is popularized by celebrity</b> <br><br>  I think that the previous two factors partially led to the fact that famous people began to register on Twitter - celebrities, which, in turn, influenced the popularity of the service.  I think you shouldn‚Äôt list their names, everyone knows about Barack Obama‚Äôs Twitter accounts, teams of actors from House MD, Oprah, Stephen Fry, etc.  Oh, and the President of Ukraine and Arseniy Yatsenyuk. <br><br>  With a certain stretch, we can say that observing the lives of famous people has become as simple as possible - using Twitter.  That also caused a wave of registrations. <br><br>  <b>- Twitter is operational</b> <br><br>  If you add subscribers to the list, instead of engaging in Twitter spam (that is, add-on users), then updates in the Twitter feed can be called the most timely source of information.  While the official publications are only going to write about the event, bloggers have already written, but still put on the blog and make out a post, Twitter has not only reported about what happened, but also actively discusses it. <br><br>  I also note that the number of microblogging services on the Web is increasing literally before our eyes.  Some of them will be able to get their audience of users, which is already happening, for example, at FriendFeed, Plurk, etc.  But the LJ audience turned out to be less active in terms of the transition from traditional blogging to micro.  The recently launched ljchat project, although <a href="http://ljchat-test.livejournal.com/2992.html">advertised with</a> might and main, has not yet demonstrated a large increase in popularity.  At least, out of my friends, where there are a lot of technographers, 4 <a href="http://ljchat.ru/chat">users</a> already registered with <a href="http://ljchat.ru/chat">ljchat</a> . <br><br>  More recently, I <a href="http://internetessa.com/2009/04/15/pochemu-ya-ne-lyublyu-twitter">wrote a</a> text about how I do not like Twitter.  In general, my attitude is not that it has not changed ... it has become different.  Twitter does not need to demand seriousness, thoughtful reading, or competent expression of thoughts.  And then it can be perceived and actively used. <br><br>  Actually, the answer to the main question of whether Twitter will replace other types of blogging is still open.  However, I think that some bloggers will replace blog hosting sites with microblogging.  But not the authors of standalone, of course. <br><br>  (I can not understand why my post is visible only to readers of the blog "I'm smart" ... :( </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/59935/">https://habr.com/ru/post/59935/</a></p>
