Consider in this capacity the IDE integrated development environment and language basis on the example of RAD Studio XE5, which consists of Delphi XE5, C ++ Builder and HTML5 Builder.  Accordingly, the language means of this package solution is Delphi / Pascal, C / C ++ and a number of popular languages ‚Äã‚Äãand technologies for Web development.  This combination is very effective if the goal of programming is to develop the universal knowledge and skills necessary to create modern software (software) in the widest possible range of students. <br><br>  The environment and programming language for developing primary skills based on elementary knowledge should provide the minimum possible threshold of entry.  Here we are talking not only about school education.  University students of any specialty must have an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow modern software is developed.  On the one hand, it is important to prepare at least competent users of already created systems.  On the other hand, practically any sphere of human activity, including humanitarian areas, requires an advanced study to develop and use complex application software.  Law, linguistics, sociology, political science, etc.  in the modern form, they imply the ability of a specialist for the functionality of the applied systems to see and understand algorithms implemented in software.

      Familiarity with programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãshould occur in school.  But for various reasons, many students start studying at universities, having a very remote idea of ‚Äã‚Äãprogramming, at least they cannot create applications on their own.  It is not necessary, speaking of mass IT education in terms of studying programming, to proceed from the assumptions about the presence of any knowledge.  That is why it is required to develop a unified approach to teaching programming in schools, in the secondary and higher educational institutions.  Once again, we note that the goal is to raise the general level of knowledge in the field of programming and application creation skills among all students on a national scale.  Author's techniques and targeted development programs for the most gifted students are not applicable to the general level.  Used languages ‚Äã‚Äãand software environments with such training are not considered when forming educational standards in schools, specialized secondary and higher educational institutions in areas not directly related to software development. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Practically the ideal solution is to start training in Delphi and then expanding the experience by using C ++ Builder to master the professional skills and training of specialists who own the most popular software development technologies.  The process of learning programming is divided into two complementary steps: <br><ul><li>  primary skills and basic knowledge in Delphi; </li><li>  training and getting to the highest level in C ++ Builder. </li></ul><br>  Let us consider in detail this approach in order of increasing load on both students and teaching staff. <br>  The ideal language for learning to program in Delphi XE5 is Pascal: <br><br>  Delphi is based on Pascal, a special language for quick learning of programming, so it has a simple and clear syntax that is not overloaded with special characters and does not require memorization of non-obvious and difficult-to-read sequences. <br><br>  The language features of the Delphi / Pascal language are such that they use easily readable and interpretable character sequences as keywords.  This allows you to ‚Äúpronounce‚Äù the texts of programs, and this is supported when using Delphi / Pascal. <br><br>  Do not forget about the teachers.  When performing practical tasks and laboratory work, it is common practice to synchronously check and identify, as well as correct, errors in the students' program code.  Normal mode implies that the teacher in the computer classroom is in a position of standing behind the student at the computer, moving from one to another.  The clearer and clearer the keywords, the easier they are distinguishable.  The harder and simpler the typical language constructs, the less time is spent on assisting the student in finding and correcting errors.  It also helps reduce the strain on the organs of vision of the teacher. <br><br>  Pascal based Delphi has a very low entry threshold.  A visual environment that supports formatting, syntax highlighting and debugging.  The environment is ergonomically balanced and comfortable for both beginners and advanced users. <br><br>  Delphi belongs to the RAD tool family.  Manual input of program text is combined with interactive manipulations with ready-made components.  The teacher can vary the methodology, starting with both ‚Äúpure‚Äù programming and ‚Äúrapid development‚Äù.  It all depends on the age, psychophysical features of a particular group of students.  You can even divide a single lesson into two parts - "classical programming" and interactive learning in a game form to maintain concentration. <br><br>  The current version is Delphi XE5, but it supports the work in the ‚Äúcanonical‚Äù training examples mode a la console application with text or file input / output. <br><br>  Delphi XE5 has a built-in set of visual 3D components.  Programming really becomes interactive.  This is not a ‚Äútedious typing of a program‚Äù, but a live interaction with the development environment.  Part of the time can be given to ‚Äúdrawing in 3D‚Äù in the design-time, then you can go to the software dynamic creation of scene objects at runtime, then add animation effects in the design-time, then programmed the reactions to the user‚Äôs action. <br><br>  Delphi is based on the traditional Pascal, many examples are easily transferred to the new version of XE5.  Educational materials on Pascal can be used in XE5 with very modest modifications.  Any development of educational materials is easy to implement based on a very extensive base of examples and textbooks. <br><br>  Pascal-based Delphi is a professional development language.  Millions of code points, commercially successful applications, a wide range of application areas.  The language capabilities of the modern version of this language do not limit students to the implementation of educational examples.  You can use generic programming methods and extended RTTI. <br><br>  Delphi XE5 allows you to create applications for mobile systems.  Now, none of the students will feel doubts about the relevance of the technology being studied.  Phone or tablet based on Android, iPhone or iPad - these modern iOS and Android devices can be programmed in the Delphi / Pascal language. <br><br>  Delphi provides early youth employment.  At the end of the school, due to the simplicity and accessibility that is the key to obtaining reliable practical use skills, graduates can independently create practically significant applications, including interaction with the DBMS at the component level. <br><br>  Delphi facilitates project-based learning in its early stages.  An easy-to-learn language, complemented by visual components for rapid interface development, built-in capabilities for interacting with databases ‚Äî all this forms a technological environment that allows you to move almost instantly from case studies to interesting projects. <br><br>  Delphi contributes to the stabilization of curricula and programs due to the ability to conduct multi-platform development for Windows, Mac OS, iOS and Android.  If for each platform to learn a separate language or technology, then you should plan training in the following areas: <br><ul><li>  one semester C; </li><li>  one semester C ++; </li><li>  one semester java; </li><li>  one semester C #; </li><li>  one semester Objective-C. </li></ul><br>  This is fully justified for specialized educational institutions or relevant specialties in universities.  But this is completely unacceptable for ordinary engineering specialties, medical universities, humanitarian universities, where only 1-2 semesters are assigned to computer science?  For schools, with the exception of specialized, this is also unacceptable. <br><br>  Delphi is a universal environment, invariant with respect to the platforms for which the application is created.  You can add new software / hardware platforms based on their popularity in the market.  The curriculum, the number and content of laboratory work remains unchanged, taking into account the peculiarities of the new platform, which does not require considerable time in a single instrument. <br><br>  Delphi for teachers and teachers contributes to the universalization of their own knowledge.  At the modern pace of development of IT-technologies, there is a big danger that students may surpass teachers in knowledge.  Let this is only a superficial acquaintance, shallow skills, formal methods - there is always the risk of losing the image.  With Delphi for Windows, Mac OS, iOS and Android, the teacher feels protected because  the latest and latest operating systems and devices are not a problem.  Virtually any modern and fashionable device brought by students to an educational institution can be programmed on the basis of a single code. <br><br>  Delphi as a single technological environment promotes collaboration between teachers and students.  The working group can be formed from students of any level, graduate students and teachers.  The situation of loss of continuity is eliminated when a junior course student is assigned to continue the work of a graduate student, but all the time is spent on mastering a new language (Java or C ++), and the actual work on upgrading the algorithmic content of the system is doomed to failure.  The unity of the language and the tool available to everyone, starting from school, is the key to success in creating a common base of source codes and the possibility of transition from the level of ‚Äúeducational application‚Äù to ‚Äúscientific project‚Äù. <br><br>  Pascal-based Delphi is not a ‚Äúlifelong‚Äù binding specifically to this technology.  C ++ Builder is a visual development environment built on the same principles as Delphi.  Students who have mastered Delphi almost instantly adapt to C ++ Builder and begin to master the specifics and capabilities of professional C / C ++ languages. <br><br>  C ++ Builder should be considered as the next stage of learning programming technologies after Delphi. <br><br>  C / C ++ is one of the most common programming languages, but they were originally designed for already trained developers with work experience.  Here it is extremely important to gradually feed the material with maximum elaboration and consolidation of the knowledge gained with specific examples. <br><br>  Training examples should be as clear as possible.  Abstract tasks demotivate students, and the C ++ Builder visual environment with ready-made components for rapid development allows you to maintain interest in practical tasks. <br>  Using C ++ Builder as a continuation of work in Delphi saves time on adapting students to a new environment.  All accents are made on the syntactic features of C / C ++, and not the general principles of building applications. <br><br>  The study and implementation of typical algorithms in parallel with familiarity with the C ++ programming language significantly increases the burden on students.  If the algorithms are already mastered, and the skills of their implementation have already been developed, then the study of C ++ is greatly accelerated. <br><br>  The complexity of the C ++ syntax is significantly compensated if students already know how to independently develop applications and debug them.  Then Delphi becomes a very convenient and useful environment for obtaining general programming skills, and the transition to C ++ Builder is a way to further improve knowledge.  It is possible that this will be realized in the form of optional classes or additional subjects in a specialized class at school or special courses of choice at the university. <br><br>  The teaching and methodical base for working in Delphi is easily portable in C ++ Builder, while retaining the majority of illustrative examples of the execution of prototypes of real applications.  A typical method for getting to know C ++ Builder quickly is to complete tasks already completed in Delph, since  visual components and methods of interaction with databases remain the same. <br><br>  After learning the basics of programming in Delphi and improving the development skills in C ++ Builder, you can use HTML5 Builder as part of RAD Studio XE5.  HTML5 Builder is a convenient visual environment for web development, including HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and PHP.  This approach will allow considering a wide range of modern programming technologies for creating applications for Windows, Mac OS, iOS, Android, as well as client and server web applications. <br><br>  RAD Studio XE5 with Delphi XE5 and C ++ Builder in its composition is a set of ideal for teaching programming environments that easily adapts to various educational institutions, their profiles, the level of initial training of students, teaching methods, as well as the goals and objectives of training - from initial acquaintance to professional skills. <br><br>  If training programs involve the use of previous versions of Delphi and C ++ Builder, then the delivery of RAD Studio XE5 provides access to them, including: Delphi XE4, Delphi XE3, Delphi XE2, Delphi XE, Delphi 2010, Delphi 2009, Delphi 2007, Delphi 7 , C ++ Builder XE4, C ++ Builder XE3, C ++ Builder XE2, C ++ Builder XE, C ++ Builder 2010, C ++ Builder 2009, C ++ Builder 2007, C ++ Builder 6. This allows you to update curriculums to use versions of XE5 without disrupting the current educational process, gradually updating course content and practical work up to mobile development for iOS and Android. <br><br>  With RAD Studio XE5, the continuity of teaching materials, textbooks and educational plans and strategies is preserved, which is extremely important because  more than 70% of schools in the Russian Federation use Delphi / Pascal in training.  But more complex C / C ++ programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãare also available in continuing to improve skills and develop knowledge, along with web programming technologies.  When creating applications for various platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, iOS, Android, as well as web applications, curricula become relevant, and students are guaranteed to be in demand as having received a universal education in the field of programming. <br><br>  Embaradero has <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/delphi/blog/203246/">simplified the delivery of RAD Studio XE5 educational licenses</a> from the point of view of student access to the described products for self-preparation, homework and course / diploma design outside the school and using personal computers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f44/805/a33/f44805a333da6984a3454a5374a2e1b7.png" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/204216/">https://habr.com/ru/post/204216/</a></p>
