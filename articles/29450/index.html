And I decided not to bother the comrade who gives me support on hosting (so that he prescribes one more site), and simply buy VDS for my own small permanent needs - such as how to pick someone up, run a perl script, just experiment - well, you understand . <br><br>  I registered, chose the plan VDS-Acceleration (400 MHz and 96 RAM), - it was reasonable to think that it should be enough, that I have only one WordPress site, and the rest are static or small scripts.

      He even paid for 1,500 rubles for half a year.  Transferred sites.  And an hour later, after the sites started working on the new server, they started to change the plan for a VDS-gap, where they give 600 MHz and 160 RAM, but already for 600 rubles a month. <br><br>  I looked in the top, saw that even 600 MHz could not cope with WordPress, spat, went to configure nginx - the benefit is, it‚Äôs straight from the socket and set.  I put it on, Apache reconfigured, nginx tweaked, spat, I put eAccelerator, I tweaked, - it seems to be more bright - but still - WordPress is spinning like a sick elephant - especially if people go there.  Yes, and loaded for a long time. <br><br>  Well, it only remains to either buy more memory (which I don‚Äôt really want to do, because I have a vacation on the nose), or drag WordPress back to Kamradovsky hosting.  There is, of course, an option - to optimize wordpress itself, - for a long time.  Well, or write your normal caching plugin, - none of those that looked - did not want to work. <br><br>  In addition to everything else, it has long been to change URLs on a blog - from idiotic archives / id_status to human-readable - / eto_nazvanie_posta <br><br>  Now wait for the new update of Yandex - readjust redirects, but I am sure that there will still be jambs and I will not be able to keep the sape for another two months for sure. <br><br>  But finally I found the strength to set up SVN + Trac and start writing my little robo start-up, the main purpose of which will be to create unique RSS feeds and normal support for reading these tapes from mabbil and other small devaysik. <br><br>  If someone needs to - I can then write an article - something like - ‚Äúhow to raise Apache2.2 + PHP5 + eAccelerator + Nginx + SVN + Trac so that all this does not collapse.‚Äù  I doubt that it will be professional - put a large part for the first time - before all hosters did after all =) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/29450/">https://habr.com/ru/post/29450/</a></p>
