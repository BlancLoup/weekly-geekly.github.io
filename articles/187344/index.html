Do not correct the tests, even if it can increase their overall score.  Do they not care about their failure to study? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d63/c10/6db/d63c106db9c2d8fab27bbbc4652865aa.jpg"><br><br>  There are many explanations for this behavior: laziness, indifference, distracting factors, etc.  But if you ask me, I will call a deeper reason: ignorance of mathematics makes you feel stupid.

      It is difficult to understand if you have never experienced this.  Fortunately, I have this experience (although then there was nothing to rejoice about).  My story about mathematical ignorance.  Perhaps something will be familiar to you. <br><br>  I went to college mathematically savvy, and at the final exam I scored the highest score.  It seemed that the mathematics comes to me quite easily.  But then I ran into topology. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4c1/c78/d4e/4c1c78d4eb8a16dc8f87489a0cac12dd.jpg"><br><br>  Lessons on topology were held in the format of seminars, where students taught each other.  Twice in a semester, each of us must prepare a lecture, give homework and evaluate it. <br><br>  My misunderstanding of the subject came calmly, gradually.  I lectured classmates, vaguely understanding only half of what was written.  I memorized the main points, but did not understand the essence of the subject, hoping that someday fragmentary knowledge would take the form of something whole.  But I did not do anything for this.  He did not ask questions because he was afraid to appear stupid.  As a result, everything became only worse, glimpses of understanding faded away, it became uninteresting.  I realized that I was completely confused. <br><br>  In the end, I did what most students do.  I relied on a man who knew the subject better than me.  It was my girlfriend (studying in the same class).  Everything that she explained to me, I simply wrote down in my own words, without delving into the essence, because of which the knowledge did not linger long in my head. <br><br>  I blamed everyone around for my failures.  Her girlfriend, who persuaded me to choose this course.  A teacher who sat in the classroom aside and laughed at our incompetence.  Why do we need this topology?  When all the excuses were over, I said to myself: I hate this class!  I hate topology! <br><br>  I hate math! <br><br>  My first experience as a lecturer in the classroom was positive, despite the fact that there was almost no knowledge of the subject.  But plunging into the material, I understood that the second lecture would not be such an easy walk. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7e7/dcb/38f/7e7dcb38fcb91bdf177d24f60fce62c9.jpg"><br><br>  I was constantly lazy, often complaining about the complexity of the subject.  But soon I realized that it was not just laziness.  Facing the fact that I did not understand, I was faced with my doubts and anxieties.  A constant postponement removes these unpleasant feelings. <br><br>  As the day of the second lecture approached, I began to panic.  I called my father, a man with a good soul.  Did not help.  I called my sister, a math teacher with whom it was always fun.  Did not help.  Then I made an appointment with the topology instructor. <br><br>  I was sweating while I was going up the elevator to his office.  The worst thing was that I admired him.  Most world-class mathematicians regarded communication with students as a burdensome act of charity.  He was different: shrewd, hardworking, sincere.  I knocked on the office door to tell him that I had failed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1cc/fe2/2e8/1ccfe22e80cba3d2b19b3ee0cadfaccf.jpg"><br><br>  He was supportive of me, offered a few ideas and helped with the presentation, so that I could show at least something in the upcoming lecture.  I begged not to ask questions about the material in the classroom, in fact I asked him not to do his job.  And he reluctantly agreed. <br><br>  I gave a second lecture and tried to forget it as quickly as possible. <br><br>  Looking back, I realize that I was the perfect example of a bad student, showing all the symptoms: <br><br><ul><li>  Entangled in the material </li><li>  I was afraid to ask questions </li><li>  I was embarrassed to accept the help of a teacher </li><li>  Instead, plagued friends </li><li>  Copying other people's homework </li><li>  Justifies himself by blaming others </li><li>  Slowed </li><li>  Afraid of failure in public </li><li>  Afraid of teacher's conviction </li><li>  Felt like an idiot </li><li>  I did not want to admit anything of the above </li></ul><br><br>  It's amazing how hard it is to write about it even now.  Mathematical failures, like romantic ones, are remembered for a long time. <br><br>  I told this story to show that the problem is not the absence of a ‚Äúnatural mind‚Äù, on the contrary, such failures occur when a combination of many reasons is combined: excessive anxiety, low motivation, gaps in knowledge of the subject, etc.  The hardest thing to avoid failures at times when you want to expose their shortcomings. <br><br>  Ignorance of topology doesn't make me stupid.  It makes me weak in topology.  This difference is very important to understand.  In the end, I am grateful for the experience. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/187344/">https://habr.com/ru/post/187344/</a></p>
