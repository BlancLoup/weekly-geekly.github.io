The first RTLS appeared at the interface of radio frequency identification (RFID) and wireless communications (WiFi) in the USA in the nineties of the last century.  Initially, RTLS was used in large clinics to quickly search for personnel and mobile equipment, as well as to monitor the vital parameters of patients and emergency medical personnel in critical situations. <br>  Technology has gained rapid development.  Now it is already a fully developed independent industry - a whole range of technologies, which has its own standards, production and service infrastructure.  Moreover, it is one of the rapidly growing industries.  The global market for RTLS is increasing annually by a third, and this growth rate is projected for the next ten years, despite the recession ( <a href="http://www.idtechex.com/research/reports/real-time-locating-systems-2012-2022-000294.asp">http://www.idtechex.com/research/reports/real-time-locating-systems-2012-2022-000294. asp</a> ). <br>  As the technology of RTLS improved, capacity expanded and prices declined, the scope of application expanded. <br>  Here are just a few modern examples of use: <br><ul><li>  investigation and search of victims in the emergency zone, </li><li>  protection of enterprises </li><li>  asset Management, </li><li>  personnel Management, </li><li>  debugging and monitoring processes </li><li>  security on offshore oil and gas platforms, </li><li>  supply chain management wholesalers, </li><li>  monitoring of a complete set of cars on the conveyor, </li><li>  and even monitoring the health of livestock in conditions of cold-free keeping. </li></ul><br><h4>  <b>Why choose RTLS?</b> </h4><br>  In modern manufacturing, transport, logistics, it is important to control the location of objects - vehicles, people, objects.  For this purpose, satellite navigation systems (GLONASS, GPS) and intelligent video surveillance systems have been created and are being developed that can independently capture and track many targets.  For the sake of solving such problems, various location systems are also created. <br>  BUT! <br>  Satellite navigation systems work only in open space, they are powerless indoors.  Video surveillance systems, giving a clear video image, are not capable of identifying a target reliably and inexpensively without human intervention. <br>  RTLS is distinguished by its ability to identify, determine the exact location and <br>  clearly show on the plan the location and movement of controlled objects.

    <h4>  <b>RTLS - eyes for ACS</b> </h4><br>  One of the current trends in the development of automated systems is to eliminate or at least reduce the influence of the ‚Äúhuman factor‚Äù by automating the input of data on the presence and location of objects.  Barcodes and RF tags are increasingly being used for this purpose.  But even in this case, as in the days of punched cards, the operator remains the indispensable attribute of the process - a girl with a scanner or a tag reader.  Alternatively, instead of a girl, a reading portal on a warehouse gate or an RFID reading post on a conveyor belt can be used.  In the latter case, not the girl goes to the object, but the object is ‚Äúdragged‚Äù to the reader. <br>  The next step in the development of data entry subsystems is RTLS, which not only automatically (without operator participation) collects and stores data on the location of objects, but can also transfer them to the ACS, both in real time and on request, for example, during inventory. <br><br><h4>  <b>RTLS is an open field for IT professionals and new opportunities for their customers</b> </h4><br>  Even from this short note, it is clear that RTLS opens up new prospects for automation in many applications.  Moreover, both by itself and in combination with existing and projected ACS - SAP ERP, SAP HCM, ACS, security systems ... <br>  As international practice shows, RTLS opens up new opportunities in various fields.  Several thousand companies engaged in the development and implementation of automated systems in more than one hundred countries of the world have adopted RTLS technology and successfully implement it in their market segments.  The introduction of such promising innovations allows them to better meet the needs of their customers, increases their competitiveness and income.  Some examples of using RTLS (in translation) can be found on the blog <a href="http://www.rtlsnet.ru/blog/">www.rtlsnet.ru/blog</a> . <br>  In Russia, the use of RTLS is just beginning. <br><br><h4>  <b>RTLS from RTLS</b> </h4><br>  But back to the creators team. <br>  Now it is LLC RTLS.  The company already serially manufactures and supplies all hardware and positioning software.  Although several weeks have passed since the official presentation, such large companies as RusHydro, Rosatom, Severstal, among others, have become interested in the RTLS system. <br><br>  Khabratopik is too small to tell about the peculiarities of the RTLS system, the technologies used, the fields of application.  If the topic is interested in Habravchan, I will write a continuation.  And the impatient can run ahead to the company's website: <a href="http://www.rtlsnet.ru/">www.rtlsnet.ru</a> - there all these issues are covered in detail. <br><habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/151496/">https://habr.com/ru/post/151496/</a></p>
