Naturally, we are extremely interested in the first two categories, but the last one is very even. <br><br>  So: <strong>4 gadgets</strong> with which anyone can stand up for justice;  or against it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/e92/b4e/a01/e92b4ea011b4a6c667a7547503f33cfe.jpg" width="450" height="320" alt="powerful rope lift" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  <a href="http://atlasdevices.com/">Atlas Devices</a> , a company engaged in the production of various devices for non-civilian purposes (special forces, army), took the development of an <strong>MIT</strong> student (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) named <strong>Nate Ball</strong> , modernized it and practically embodied the Batman hook.  True with the size of a bit did not work. <br><br>  This Powered Rope Ascender (powerful rope hoist) is able to lift a person along a rope at a speed of <strong>3 meters per second</strong> , moreover, he can easily be transported on his belt, except that he will slightly ‚Äúpull the pocket‚Äù.

In order to soar and realize one of the most ancient human desires, 80% of the body consisting of water needs a little help.  Fortunately - while we are sitting in easy chairs in front of our computers, there are people risking their lives for us.  The fact that we then give our money for their former risk is irrelevant. <br><br>  It is completely incomprehensible thing that the photo above is a jet belt.  I, however, have a hard time turning my tongue to call it a belt and I am more inclined to the wording "jetpack".  So - this very Jetpack, from the company <a href="http://www.tecaeromex.com/ingles/RB-i.htm">Technologia Aeroespacial Mexicana</a> (Mexican pilots is already funny), is sold at a price of <strong>$ 125,000</strong> .  But do not rush to close the page - there are a couple of pleasant things.  For this money, each buyer will undergo a course of training and a special apparatus in order to make <s>moonshine</s> fuel for a jetpack at home.  Moreover, it is argued that components for fuel can be found without problems in any country in the world. <br>  All this can be stored in an underground lair - no one will find. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/b63/1f3/cc9/b631f3cc9b23c501d2ca2c9ee64aa57f.jpg" width="200" height="186" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">  We turn to the most interesting.  What could be a real superhero without x-ray vision?  Naturally - no.  This integral part of super-essence can not only save lives in a tense moment, but also amuse well. <br><br>  <strong>Thruvision</strong> 's <a href="http://www.thruvision.com/articles/latest-news-thruvision-announce-the-t5000-an-extended-range-outdoor-security-imaging-system....html">T5000</a> is not a fucking mukhra, but a terahertz X-ray image system, which, as we all understand perfectly well, can "undress" everyone around.  So far, it is still not portable enough to be embedded in glasses, but you can easily hoist it on the Batmobile (or whatever you have).  T5000 time will show the explosives in the pants of the enemy, drugs in the intestines, plastic under the shirt and thong girls at the party.  The only thing that is not possible to find out - what color they were.  The main thing is not to get involved - in large doses, X-rays may be unsafe. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/4a2/e6d/8de/4a2e6d8de518e427dd44b0f49136b845.jpg" width="200" height="150" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">  Well, <strong>Batarang</strong> is almost the same as the familiar boomerang, but with one small exception, which I tried to find for a long time.  Useless. <br>  But back to the topic: in spite of the fact that boomerangs (and batteries), in theory, are intended for combat, you will have to choose between knocking out a pistol from the hands of a villain and catching a boomerang.  It is hardly possible to do both at the same time. <br><br>  After reading the Wikipedia article, I learned that "boomerangs were used in hunting to scare small animals from shelters."  But in the end, if not a boomerang, so <strong>returning shurikens</strong> like Batman.  Although there is one big problem with them: if they are sharp enough to cut the ropes and heavy enough to break through the glass - who wants to catch them? <br><br>  In the footsteps of <a href="http://blog.wired.com/">Wired</a> for <a href="http://dvice.ru/">Dvice</a> <br>  Photo of a drunken superhero - <a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/wiseacre/">Paul Armstrong</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/26542/">https://habr.com/ru/post/26542/</a></p>
