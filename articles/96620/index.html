  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Yandex.Direct How to cut budgets: pictures of life</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the film Jurassic Park, the cynical doctor Jan Malcolm, played by Jeff Goldblum, tells about a tyrannosaur: "... he will eat you, and you will still be alive at this time."  The example below is different from horror stories only in that the victim remains alive and unharmed.  But only physically.  What can not be said about his money. <br><br>  Statistics of the advertising campaign for 2 months of the client (subject: tourism) of a large advertising agency (we will not voice the name of the RA, it is already heard).  Certified, in quotes, the advertising agency specialists set up the campaign in such a way that as a result, the client received mediocre costs of almost 90,000 rubles with almost zero efficiency for 2 months of work (99% of ads were broadcast below the third position to the right). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Purchased requests had the most remote relation to the client's business.  Exaggerating, we can say that the request for a ‚Äúcart‚Äù was bought for the car dealer only on the grounds that this unit has no less wheels.  Ads about the cart were shown where the need for them was like a fifth wheel cart.  And where there is a need - in their carts in bulk. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3d5/da3/dcf/3d5da3dcff5725c6828e4c56f3141a02.jpg" alt="image"><br>  All this was "before" the client's appeal.  After the appeal, the following was done: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      The campaign was divided into three parts: <br><br>  1. The main campaign (more than 100 ads) was broadcast only to Moscow (Yandex search dominated).  Were newly, "from scratch" picked up new keywords that describe the client's business. <br>  The result: a sharp decrease in useless impressions throughout the former 1/6 of the land while simultaneously increasing the CTR and, as a result, the mass of calls from those who are really interested in the transaction.  The number of calls has increased significantly, and sales have gone up the hill. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8a7/a1a/f44/8a7a1af44b42a217970107425894fc3c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  2. The second, the so-called.  The supporting campaign (a complete copy of the main one) worked only at night (after 7:00 pm) with a connected YAN and with low rates.  You may notice that even with this campaign, with an average rate of 20 cents, the CTR is higher than that of the one that prepared the RA client. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d13/834/578/d13834578ec1f5cd1119b25921c5d2c3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  3. The third campaign (over 200 ads) ‚Äúcollected‚Äù low-cost traffic on specific hotel names.  Campaign statistics - below. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0c6/a69/366/0c6a69366bfbdbe54a7656a92eedba26.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  So what has been done.  Re-selected keywords and prepared the required number of new ads (1 request - one ad).  Three new advertising campaigns were launched: on search (main inquiries) for Yandex, night campaign on search with YAN targeting (main inquiries on understated rates), campaign-template with exact names of tour directions.  Target all this economy on the hero-city of Moscow and no less heroic MO. <br><br>  As a result (see statistics above): <br><br>  - consumption for 2 months decreased by almost 6 times (to 495.59 cu against 2920 cu.); <br>  - sharply increased CTR (4.6% vs. 0.78%); <br>  - average rates have decreased (0.32U.E. against 0.42U.E.); <br>  - 90% of ads were broadcast in positions 1 or 2 special placement with the correct keywords; <br>  - as a result, the number of calls and customers increased dramatically. <br><br>  What happened after the representatives of the advertising agency saw the work done?  If you think that these guys have apologized and admitted their mistakes, then you are mistaken.  They rode in 30 minutes and offered a banal "kickback" to the director of the travel agency. <br><br>  There was a general happiness.  A curtain. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/96620/">https://habr.com/ru/post/96620/</a></p>
