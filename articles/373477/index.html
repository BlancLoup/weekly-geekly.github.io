But age in this case does not play any role, since Bakshi is smart beyond his years.  He has been programming from the cradle, and has been teaching others for the past few years.  According to Bakshi, his goal is to help the 100,000 programmers who have just begun to master programming. <br><br>  His main interests are cognitive technologies and IBM Watson.  And, by the way, Bakshi is the official developer in the IBM Watson group. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The team IBM Watson Bakshi hit in 2015.  His official position is IBM Cloud Advisor.  Bakshi received a love for programming from his father, who believes that his son has already surpassed him.  ‚ÄúI do not program for iOS or Watson, I do not develop neural networks, as he does.  In fact, my knowledge makes up only 5% of my son‚Äôs knowledge, ‚Äùsays the father.

      Earlier this year, Bakshi took part in the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/us/en/interconnect/">IBM InterConnect</a> conference, where he shared his vision of the direction of cognitive technology development. <br><br>  Last month, a young programmer was invited to participate in the development of the project ‚ÄúThe Cognitive Story‚Äù using IBM cognitive technologies.  The authors of the project plan to develop mobile applications for people with disabilities.  Tangmai has extensive experience in developing mobile applications.  His first programs were accepted in the AppStore, when the boy was only 9 years old. <br><br>  And now he was invited to take part in one of the projects of the <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/software/businesscasestudies/my/en/corp%3Fsynkey%3DK703375W23697I56">Darwin Ecosystem</a> company.  Tanmai will take part in <a href="https://www.darwinecosystem.com/hubfs/2017%2520Website%2520Elements/Page%2520Images/Tanmay%2520Bio.pdf%3Ft%3D1494281335016">creating a</a> computer interface for paralyzed.  The first person to test this development will be a 29-year-old man from Canada who suffers from complete paralysis. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/868/0f4/917/8680f491708a4804cef118e4c0bdf9d7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  If the approbation is successful, then the development will be able to take advantage of other people who are unable to control the facial muscles of the face or move their eyes.  They will be able to interact with the outside world using a computer.  The basis for the development is the IBM Bluemix platform and the Watson cognitive system. <br><br>  The young programmer will be engaged in even more serious work, studying the nuances of the cognitive systems and creating new systems.  ‚ÄúHis youth and ability will help to reach new heights of knowledge.  Frankly, the ability to think outside the box can surprise us all, ‚Äùsaid the head of Darwin Ecosystems. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/373477/">https://habr.com/ru/post/373477/</a></p>
