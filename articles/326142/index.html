The lobby of the second floor, leading to four rooms for reading reports. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ba9/450/a7c/ba9450a7ceef4ead9139f397eaaf0266.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Stands (so-called <i>booths</i> , <i>booths</i> ) sponsors.  <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/">JetBrains, the</a> beloved company of all, this year limited itself to a modest banner.  Practically no one was left indifferent to the <a href="https://twitter.com/_REDNBLACK_/status/850234414822850561">tasks</a> proposed by <a href="https://www.gridgain.com/">GridGain</a> , another sponsor of the conference.  Also in the photo below are the stands of <i>Deutsche Bank</i> and <i>Odnoklassniki</i> companies. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/91b/736/ab2/91b736ab2da84ebd9f43e8fb9d8b596f.jpg"></a> <br><br>  In part of the hall of the second floor Ruslan <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/arg89/" class="user_link">ARG89</a> Akhmetzyanov and Yevgeny <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/phillennium/" class="user_link">phillennium</a> Trifonov interviewed the speakers, who had already <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/jugru/blog/326542/">received a high rating</a> .  As you can see, Yevgeny Borisov, Sasha Goldstein and Oleg Chirukhin are being interviewed. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/523/7d7/ae4/5237d7ae40cd413eb88ec78846e8089f.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Excellent discovery, proven last year, were the <i>discussion areas</i> .  The opportunity to ask the speakers questions after the report and to consult turned out to be very popular. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/24e/735/698/24e735698a4b45c28df48434a8dd88b8.jpg"></a> <br><br><h3>  Conference opening </h3><br>  The long-awaited opening of the conference by Alexey Fedorov and Andrey Dmitriev.  In the first rows it is not difficult to know Tagir Valeev, Viktor Gamov and Baruch Sadogursky. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/34a/31d/1fc/34a31d1fc7824671bd5795cae54a74b4.jpg"></a> <br><br><h3>  First Day Reports </h3><br>  On the first day, as well as on the second, it was proposed to choose one of four simultaneously read reports.  The choice was certainly facilitated by the diversity of the topics of the reports and the opportunity to see later any of the missed reports in the record. <br><br>  <b>Performance: What is in My Name to You?</b> <br>  <i>Alexey Shipilev, Red Hat</i> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5c8/696/bad/5c8696badcc8435d8751e15654a3fa29.jpg"></a> <br><br>  The conference was opened by a report, the previous version of which was previously presented to them at <i>Joker 2016</i> .  Since that time, the report has changed a bit and increased in volume. <br><br>  Alexey is deservedly recognized as one of the most interesting, authoritative and sought-after speakers.  The famous <i>curve to them.</i>  <i>Sh.</i> From this report was also mentioned in the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/326242/">recent interview with Vladimir Dolzhenko</a> (another speaker at the conference). <br><br>  Whether it was worth reversing the reports of Alexey, putting the new report in place of the keynote (it is described later) is a difficult question.  This report may indeed be better suited to start the conference. <br><br>  <b>Java Puzzlers NG S02: All Wonderful and Wonderful</b> <br>  <i>Tagir Valeev and Baruh Sadogursky</i> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/382/5ac/101/3825ac101dec4f4889e385d24368330f.jpg"></a> <br><br>  The conference held the premiere in Russian of the second season of <i>Java Puzzlers NG</i> .  Remarkable was the participation in the presentation of one of the main authors (or chief) - Tagir <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/lany/" class="user_link">lany</a> Valeeva. <br><br>  Earlier this year, in English, Baruh Sadogursky and Victor Gamov already spoke at several international conferences with this report (the best entry is from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DJ3MpjyLFE44">Devoxx US 2017</a> ).  On closer examination, the slides are a little different, so the new performance is still exclusive.  Previously, he restrained himself from viewing the record with <i>Devoxx</i> (interrupting on the third puzzle piece) so that the visit to the report makes sense. <br><br>  Baruch and Tagir were traditionally in shock.  Baruch gush with wit, charging everyone with a good mood.  Tagir successfully parried, causing public admiration.  Pleased with the puzzle about <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/jugru/blog/324318/">Jigsaw</a> , the main part of <i>Java 9</i> . <br><br>  <b>Distribute and conquer - 2: Data streams strike back</b> <br>  <i>Victor Gamov, Hazelcast</i> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d00/40f/24c/d0040f24c1bc47939e887ae143e96428.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Victor, I suppose, many of the readers know, listening to the podcast <a href="http://razbor-poletov.com/blog/archives/">for more than 5 years,</a> <a href="http://razbor-poletov.com/">Debriefing</a> (co-founder and co-host of which he is).  In addition, on the last <i>Joker</i> and <i>JPoint,</i> he is also one of the active speakers. <br><br>  Previous (Part 1) report <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DJ68pBDicGII">Distribute and Conquer: an introduction to distributed systems</a> was in the <i>JPoint 2016 Student Day</i> program.  According to the results of the last report, in order to refute the accusations in reviews (about the demonstration of the ‚Äúbanal example of counting words in a file‚Äù), it was decided to complicate the task.  Further, using the example of <s>Hazelcast of a</s> typical software product of the <i>in-memory data grid</i> class, demonstrate the benefits of stream processing. <br><br>  Victor, as always, was convincing, bright, fiery and energetic.  For what we respect and love him. <br><br>  <b>Scalability in distributed in-memory systems</b> <br>  <i>Vladimir Ozerov, GridGain Systems</i> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/736/94f/0a8/73694f0a8976427989ed45bcdbe0f6aa.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Vladimir is known to the author of these lines above all for the remarkable monthly <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/311530/">Digest of interesting events from the world of Java, and</a> , alas, it was interrupted at issue 9. Certainly, the <a href="https://jug.ru/category/news/">Friday issues of JUG.ru news</a> greatly help (many thanks <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/phillennium/" class="user_link">phillennium</a> ).  But let there be more ‚Äúgood and different‚Äù digests, suddenly Vladimir will resume his releases. <br><br>  <i>GridGain</i> is a competitor to <i>Hazelcast</i> , so it was doubly interesting (apart from respect for the personality of the speaker) to listen to an alternative point of view. <br><br>  The story was devoted to the features, difficulties and ways to overcome them when scaling in distributed systems, <a href="https://ignite.apache.org/">Apache Ignite</a> in particular.  Good, interesting and lively report. <br><br>  <b>Application Performance Monitoring: Comparison of Features, Problems and Solutions</b> <br>  <i>Yaroslav Kiselev, KROK</i> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c2e/2aa/b23/c2e2aab23c5c4f46ac5efd37a73a6523.jpg"></a> <br><br>  This report was held in parallel with the report of such a master as Yevgeny Borisov.  Despite such compelling competition, the occupancy of the Yaroslav Hall was decent, with which he can be congratulated. <br><br>  The narration was conducted about the approaches and tools for monitoring application performance.  Some were discouraged by screenshots of the used monitoring application that were specially cropped from above. <br><br>  The report attracted interest not only from me.  In particular, Gleb Smirnov, who was present in the hall, commented on the theme of dump formats unification. <br><br>  <b>The challenge of collective responsibility</b> <br>  <i>Alexey Savvateev, Dmitry Pozharsky University</i> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/861/46c/bde/86146cbdef5548ebabcefc57bc44e42f.jpg"></a> <br><br>  The final day was the report of Alexei Savvateev.  A distinctive feature of <i>JUG.ru</i> conferences was the expansion of the outlook of participants in technical conferences with such reports.  Most often they end one or both days of the conference. <br><br>  It can be said that the speech turned out to be useful both for the speaker and the audience.  Alexey admitted that it was the largest audience before which he had the opportunity to speak.  The listeners had the opportunity to get an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe practical application of game theory, alas, not always working in our realities. <br><br>  <b>"Debriefing" Live!</b> <br><br>  The day ended with a party in the office of <i>Sberbank-Technologies</i> . <br><br>  Baruch and Victor, preparing for online broadcasting.  Andrei Kogun, who looked at the light (participant of the conference program committee, leader of <a href="http://jug.msk.ru/">jug.msk.ru</a> ).  Almost the full composition of the podcast <a href="http://razbor-poletov.com/">Debriefing</a> and Evgeny Borisov. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/160/5c4/3f4/1605c43f4e8246ffb9b54b24b442a2c6.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Yegor Bugaenko, warming up before his report the next day.  Tagir Valeev, called to help in discussions with Yegor. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/294/723/c40/294723c4072047ec9c62a633a231ddc9.jpg"></a> <br><br><h3>  Second day reports </h3><br>  <b>Curse Spring Test</b> <br>  <i>Kirill Tolkachev and Evgeny Borisov</i> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/436/f03/d39/436f03d3965242eea914fb0545774c13.jpg"></a> <br><br>  The duo of Cyril and Eugene gathered a full room for those who wanted to listen to them, despite the fact that it was the earliest report of that day. <br><br>  In live (‚Äúlive‚Äù in the literal sense - Cyril was engaged in live coding) and in a relaxed manner it was told about testing applications based on <i>Spring Boot</i> .  The experimental application imitated the expert opinion of other remarkable conference speakers, Egor Bugayenko and Baruh Sadogursky. <br><br>  Hilarious mutual altercations were illustrated by the rapid dialing and changing of the code by Kirill.  Demonstrated the use of new annotations and features cache context manipulation, sometimes very nontrivial. <br><br>  <b>Shenandoah: a garbage collector that could</b> <br>  <i>Alexey Shipilev, Red Hat</i> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1c9/d5c/82a/1c9d5c82a9f14adeb74bd780f83f9aac.jpg"></a> <br><br>  At the second report of Alexey Shipilev at this conference, as you can see, there were so many who wanted to get there that some had to sit on the floor in the aisles between the rows. <br><br>  The report was about a new garbage collector, to which even a separate <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/189">JEP 189 is</a> dedicated <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/189">: Shenandoah: An Ultra-Low-Pause-Time Garbage Collector</a> .  The very name <i>Shenandoah</i> ( <i>Shenandoah</i> ) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenandoah">has many meanings</a> , from the Indian chief to geographical features in different countries. <br><br>  ‚ÄúQuickly, cheerfully, mercilessly‚Äù (quoted by Alexei himself) the audience was told about the theoretical foundations of garbage collection, the advantages and disadvantages of various algorithms, while focusing on <i>Shenandoah itself</i> .  Alexey was beautiful, about which, I hope, he will be written more than once in the responses to the report. <br><br>  <b>Let's make Hibernate fast again</b> <br>  <i>Nikolai Alimenkov, EPAM</i> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b4b/f26/7cc/b4bf267cc47a4a71a781789d0d6b00ef.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Another frequent and honored speaker at conferences organized by <i>JUG.ru</i> (and the conference organizer himself, the most famous of which is <a href="http://jeeconf.com/">JEEConf</a> ). <br><br>  Nikolay told, confirming what was said in the <a href="https://github.com/xpinjection/hibernate-performance">code</a> , about the performance improvements of the widely <s>beloved</s> <a href="http://hibernate.org/">Hibernate</a> widely <s>loved by all</s> .  It can be said for sure that the majority did not think about many (or at least some) things (or didn‚Äôt attach any importance to exactly).  At least, when the need for tuning arises, it will now be possible to recall the presentation and look into the code of examples. <br><br>  <b>Code Vectoring Techniques in JVM</b> <br>  <i>Vladimir Ivanov, Oracle</i> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e6e/111/25c/e6e11125c029426db9ea02051087a6a3.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Modern processors have vector instructions in the instruction set (the so-called <i>Single Instruction-Multiple Data</i> , <i>SIMD</i> ).  Magically, for the <i>JVM</i> application programmer, the full power of these instructions can be used for parallel processing.  Or can not be involved, as lucky.  How and when this magic works (or does not work) was discussed. <br><br>  The report fully justifies the ‚Äúhardcore‚Äù mark made in the conference program.  And from this it becomes no less interesting, fully consistent with the spirit of the conference. <br><br>  <b>A tale about how an HTTP / 2 Client engineer overclocked</b> <br>  <i>Sergey Kuksenko, Oracle</i> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/db8/4eb/b23/db84ebb232b94525990a0b547747d334.jpg"></a> <br><br>  With unrelenting attention, starting with ‚Äú <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/178889/">Kuksenko</a> ‚Äôs <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/178889/">benefit performance with Shipilev</a> ‚Äù (according to Nikita Lipsky) to <i>JavaOne Russia</i> , I follow the emergence of new reports by Sergey. <br><br>  The current report can be attributed to the genre of an exciting detective investigation.  The subject of the observation (suspect?) Is the implementation of <i>HTTP / 2</i> in the <i>HTTP</i> client ( <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/110">JEP 110</a> ).  The implementation will be included in version 9, but so far as an experimental one (the so-called <i>incubator</i> ). <br><br>  Step by step, <s>evidence for evidence,</s> alteration for alteration brings to <s>the crime of</s> acceptable performance.  By the end of the story, the viewer sighs with relief - the <s>culprit is found</s> <i>HttpClient</i> overtook <i>JettyClient</i> ! <br><br>  <b>Going Native: Foreign Functions on the JVM</b> <br>  <i>Charles Nutter, Red Hat</i> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/11e/f3b/857/11ef3b8577d048d3a1e75dfbcb9568db.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Charles arrives for the second year at the <i>JUG.ru</i> conference, starting with <i>Joker 2016</i> (a <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/jugru/blog/324668/">recent interview</a> with him, taken before his arrival this year). <br><br>  The report briefly describes some possible ways to access <i>native</i> ( <i>native</i> ) libraries of operating systems from the <i>JVM</i> , concentrating on a detailed description of the <a href="https://github.com/jnr">Java Native Runtime</a> ( <i>JNR</i> ) modules.  At the end, the future is mentioned, which awaits us (in <i>Java 10</i> or later) for this purpose - <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/panama/">Project Panama</a> . <br><br><h3>  Conference closing </h3><br>  Closing the conference speech of Alexei Fedorov.  Organizers, speakers, volunteers on the stage. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/737/e45/8bf/737e458bfcfe4c749419a760998a348f.jpg"></a> <br><br><h3>  Results </h3><br>  The organizers have done a great job of preparing and holding the conference, the speakers provided a lot of interesting reports, the new venue was justified.  The conference was definitely a success. <br><br>  Files of all presentations <a href="https://jpoint.ru/">are available</a> on the conference website.  Leaving feedback participants have already sent a link to the video of all reports. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/326142/">https://habr.com/ru/post/326142/</a></p>
