  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Save time or manage it?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Now they talk a lot about saving time.  But there is a negative meaning in this expression.  Saving time is directly related to saving on yourself.  Does it have an effect?  Is that short-term.  Rigid timeframes, increased speed of work is a constant stress.  Which, sooner or later, will affect the performance and health is not the best way.  So here we will talk about effective time management. <br>  Effective time management depends on such factors: <br>  - the speed of execution of certain operations; <br>  - the speed of obtaining and exchanging information at all levels of the organization; <br>  - temporary synchronization of tasks, projects, employees, partners and clients. <br><a name="habracut"></a>  Of course, there are other factors that influence time management.  But, in this case, we will dwell in greater detail on the managerial factors that influence the effective use of working time.  After all, most managers and employees are experiencing a shortage of work time.  As clients, contractors do not work 24 hours a day. <br>  What can affect these factors?  Painted by the minute of the day, self-discipline and all that is offered to save time, is clearly not enough.  We need a systematic approach that will cover all levels of the organization and will give the manager real time management levers not only in the organization, but also in the external environment. <br>  Here come to the aid of modern information technology.  Against the background of many programs for business, it is possible to select a product that is quite interesting for managers - ‚ÄúSimple Business‚Äù ( <a href="http://www.prostoy.ru/">http://www.prostoy.ru</a> ).  The functions of the real time management not only of the manager, but also of partners, employees, clients, are implemented here in a rather original way.  Consider some of them. <br><br>  <b>Employee time management</b> <br>  To begin with, it is not enough to manage only your time for time management. <br>  In Simple Business, employee time management is organized using the <b>Automatic Time Tracking</b> feature <b>.</b> <br>  To enable the function, it is enough to put a "tick" directly in the working window of your organization.  From this point on, the manager is able to control the staff‚Äôs working time on-line. <br>  Control is organized quite simply.  After the feature is enabled, all employees will have a case assignment window.  The employee, in the program, indicates what he is doing and gets down to work.  The work performed is related to the tasks that are assigned to the employee and the calendar, which allows you to link processes with calendar time. <br>  It is interesting that employees can assign affairs not only to themselves, but also to other employees.  This is convenient for those organizations where project teams work or teamwork on tasks is conducted. <br>  What do the employees do, within the framework of what task, how much time is spent on it and other information is available for the manager in the corresponding menu ‚ÄúSimple business‚Äù. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/24a/739/636/24a7396363e475d2306ebac197465009.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>The calendar</b> <br>  Starting with version 1.6, the ‚ÄúSimple Business‚Äù users have access to an upgraded Calendar.  The main difference of this tool from similar browser or regular programs is that the user synchronizes his affairs not only with dates, but also with the work of the entire organization.  That is, calendar dates are ‚Äútied‚Äù to specific projects, tasks, and employee affairs. <br>  In addition to convenient calendar management, it is possible to use the modes of linear display of events (‚Äútimeline‚Äù) or the ‚ÄúGantt chart‚Äù mode.  It depends on how the user is better perceived graphic information. <br>  Calendar is not a separate program.  This is the ‚ÄúSimple Business‚Äù tool - so the procedure for creating cases, linking them to tasks, is quick and simple. <br>  Thus, the Calendar allows you to quickly and easily plan your work, organize a day, a week or a longer period of time. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d34/5d6/ab0/d345d6ab08ae686f99b65076566c1dce.png" alt="image">

      <b>Document flow and document templates</b> <br>  Modern organizations will never give up documents.  And the matter is not only in the mandatory financial statements (invoices, invoices, legal documents), but also in elementary management accounting.  What is written with a pen, as they say, is not cut down with an ax. <br>  To begin with, in ‚ÄúSimple Business‚Äù it is very convenient to create a document repository.  A simple quick search system allows you to find a document in seconds, even if it was created by another user.  That's not all. <br>  In any organization, dozens of documents of the same type can be created daily.  The program "Simple business" provides ready-made document templates for users, as well as the ability to import or create your own templates. <br>  What does this give?  First, creating a document from a template takes significantly less time.  Secondly, the manager gets the opportunity to realize the corporate culture in the organization.  For example, all clients receive documents with the same structure and formatting.  The manager also does not need to understand the structure of documents from different employees.  Information is perceived and processed faster. <br>  The ‚ÄúSimple Business‚Äù document management tools allow you to automate and simplify the creation, transfer and closing of documents. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/32a/511/5a4/32a5115a4630feb70d3c01fc02883fb3.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Organizing data using a spreadsheet</b> <br>  Even in a small company, a large amount of operational, managerial and operational information is created and used.  For example, managers, referral managers, and employees often need information about working with clients and contractors.  No time savings will help you quickly find the information you need and quickly use it in your work.  Therefore, business application developers create tools to create a single repository of information. <br>  The Simple Business tool is implemented Universal Table.  The table is created by the head or administrator, as directed by the head.  Employees contribute information to a table and thus creates a repository. <br>  Information in the Universal Table is provided in a convenient for perception, tabular form.  The head can create or change the structure of the table, sort the data for more convenient use in work. <br>  In the Universal Table, a manager or employee can quickly find the necessary information, for example, about working with a specific supplier or contractor.  To quickly navigate through the data there is a search string. <br>  What is important for management accounting, it is possible to view the history of creating, editing records in the table. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3b5/bdb/c59/3b5bdbc59b36baac1aba544c6ab9c369.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Operational communications</b> <br>  The basis of modern business is operational communications, with employees, customers and partners, contractors.  Classical meetings, audiences of managers and specialists in the office of the head are a thing of the past. <br>  The developers of ‚ÄúSimple Business‚Äù provided the program with broad communication capabilities, which distinguishes this program from many analogues.  We will stop, in our opinion, the most interesting and promising means of communication from the "Simple Business" - video chat. <br>  Of course, there are many programs that are quite popular with which you can organize a video conference.  Let's start with the fact that this function is built into ‚ÄúSimple Business‚Äù.  That is, it is enough for you, your employees, partners to establish ‚ÄúSimple Business‚Äù.  There are no problems of compatibility of programs, dependence on technical problems of a program whose developers are located in another country, etc. <br>  Even if a person has no ‚ÄúSimple Business‚Äù, you can still invite him to video chat by sending the appropriate link via email directly from ‚ÄúSimple Business‚Äù.  Users of "Simple Business" are invited from the contact list. <br>  To video chat does not turn into a farce, the head can manage the process.  Using functions, you can assign roles to video chat participants.  For example, the speaker, the listener. <br>  Video chat participants can manage their status by alerting other participants to whether they are in place, gone, etc. <br>  In addition to video chat, there are other means of communication: telephony, sending faxes and sms.  Of course, there is a program management and work with e-mail.  The convenience here is that you and your employees do not need to install additional programs, applications.  All means of communication are already built into ‚ÄúSimple Business‚Äù and, which is important for ordinary users, are simpler to operate. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/81f/d73/c40/81fd73c409a67fe32960551a98f82adc.png" alt="image"><br><br>  As part of the usual review, unfortunately, it is impossible to describe all the functions and features of ‚ÄúSimple Business‚Äù in time management.  We will note another important point.  Often the use of software for business turns into a waste of time, despite the promises of developers.  This is due to the installation and mastering of the program.  The developers of ‚ÄúSimple Business‚Äù took these disadvantages into account when creating their program.  The program "Simple business" is quickly installed.  It is enough to download the installation file from the developer‚Äôs site.  For quick mastering of the program, developers provided detailed background information, including video tutorials.  Also for users, on-line, technical support service works. <br>  Of course, ‚ÄúSimple Business‚Äù will not solve all the problems with the effective use of time, and people remain the main factor.  Nevertheless, the ‚ÄúSimple Business‚Äù functions and its capabilities will be of interest to those who count time and money. <habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/135307/">https://habr.com/ru/post/135307/</a></p>
