  <section class="page js-page"><h1>My thoughts. What is a brand?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <strong>And again the story of life.</strong>  <strong>Or rather, a small note, which was born thanks to a recent walk through the Kolomna Reserve with one wonderful person.</strong>  <strong>:-)</strong> <br>  Despite the fact that our professions are diametrically different, we reflected on brands, trademarks and their ilk.  Most likely, our conversation was the final boiling point, which served as the writing of an article on the blog.  Prior to this, in correspondence with the author of <a href="http://www.marazmu.net/">Marazmu.net</a> , Alexander (the author) informed me that he wants to make a brand out of his project (youth magazine) for a maximum of a year.  I‚Äôm not even talking about companies that are entering the market and are already calling all their products brands.  ;-) <br>  I have a very clear understanding of the wording of the brand, so I sometimes want to very much ‚Äúbeat‚Äù those who make mistakes when mentioning their products and call them brands.  In general, the term ‚Äúbrand‚Äù is a very conditional concept, because as a brand we will never be able to touch with you.  (Here you can recall Lindstrom, who proposes to decompose the brand into parts and each part must be recognized by the target audience. I would say that you can decompose the product / service, and the consumer will understand in his mind which particular brand is being referred to). <br>  <strong>And now the definitions.</strong> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Mine, as I understand it and how I work.  <strong>A brand is an image that, through integrated marketing communications, is created in the minds of consumers.</strong>  <strong>The image is created in the minds of users who are aware that they receive, using a particular product or using a certain service</strong> . <br>  <a href="http://slovari.yandex.ru/dict/glossary/article/302/0302_190.HTM%3Ftext%3D%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580%25D1%258D%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4">Yandex dictionaries say</a> .  A brand is an image of a brand of a product or service in the mind of a buyer, distinguishing it among competing brands.  The brand is subdivided into brand-name and brand-image. <br>  <strong>The saddest mistake.</strong>  Many advertisers, brand managers, etc., believe that one can dig into the minds and read people's minds.  This is not and never will be.  We live in the real world.  In fact, in the minds of consumers, the brand image is formed spontaneously and creates a very, very long time.  In order for the buyer to speak in the language of the product, he needs to provide the maximum benefits that he receives from using a particular product.  It is even more important to involve people in the life of the brand and to prove that it (the product) is the coolest for us (the consumers).  And you want to say that this can be done in one year?  Of course.  not. <br>  <strong>Let's argue with examples to make it easier to feel the reality.</strong>  Tell me, for you sausage "Dymov" brand?  For me, no, because I know nothing about them, about their production and so on. Things that are important in the food industry.  For example, Mikoyan is a brand.  Everyone who consumes sausage knows (or at least a little remembers) that this company has long been a supplier of the Moscow Kremlin, everyone knows that they use advanced technologies, they have a history and quality that has been tested for decades.  Will you argue?  I'm ready. <br>  <strong>More examples.</strong>  <a href="http://www.yandex.ru/">Yandex</a> and <a href="http://www.webalta.ru/">Vebalta</a> .  What do you say?  "Hammer in Yandex" or "Find in Webalt"?  I think everyone knows what company can be called a brand, and which only a company that offers online searches. <br>  And there are a lot of such examples.  From personal experience.  I use the services of " <a href="http://www.beeline.ru/">Beeline</a> " and " <a href="http://megafonmoscow.ru/">Megaphone</a> ".  The first company always reminds me of the values ‚Äã‚Äãand benefits that I receive when choosing it.  Things are different with the second one.  Truth follows from this too.  Not <strong>any product / service can become a brand, despite its venerable age.</strong> <br>  <strong>And as a conclusion, or conclusion.</strong>  Brand and product are not the same.  You can touch the product, the brand can not.  I will not load you with numbers (the economic component of the brand), everyone already knows what percentage of Central Asia needs to know about the product so that it can be said that the product / service is perceived as a brand. <br>  I know the article is very controversial.  But as said, these are my thoughts. <br>  <strong>Additionally.</strong> <br>  <a href="http://www.preveryday.ru/%3Fp%3D21">Review of the book by Martin Lindstrom "Sense of the brand."</a> </div>
