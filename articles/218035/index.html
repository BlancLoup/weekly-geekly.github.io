In this regard, I would very much like to know the public opinion about which format of additional education is the most interesting and whether it is needed at all. <br><br>  There are several main formats of additional education: <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Online Courses </h2><br>  I am sure that everyone heard about them.  MOOC (Massive open online courses) - hundreds began to emerge after the success of Stanford start-up Coursera. <br>  <b>Pros:</b> <br>  These are online courses, that is, they can be listened to from anywhere in the world, and then, when there is time for it. <br>  Lectures are given by lecturers from the world's best universities, it is possible to communicate with a very wide audience in the forums. <br>  <b>Minuses:</b> <br>  Lack of dialogue with the teacher. <br>  Most courses are aimed at a very wide audience, there are almost no ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù courses. <br>  For the "certified" diploma you need to pay.

    <h2>  Certification courses </h2><br>  These are courses for a specific platform or application.  For example, courses Microsoft, SAP or Oracle. <br>  <b>Pros:</b> <br>  At the exit, you get a diploma that can help with a job. <br>  Companies are often interested in certifying employees and paying for training. <br>  <b>Minuses:</b> <br>  The narrow focus of such courses. <br>  No one will certify you in the field of graph theory, for example =). <br><br><h2>  Public lectures </h2><br>  The openness of the lectures suggests that anyone can attend.  Such computer science lectures in St. Petersburg are held at the <a href="http://compsciclub.ru/">Computer Science Club</a> at POMI RAS. <br>  <b>Pros:</b> <br>  There are advanced courses. <br>  An excellent chance to listen to lectures of outstanding scientists. <br>  <b>Minuses:</b> <br>  Do not give a diploma. <br>  Courses are often unrelated. <br>  There is no training program. <br><br><h2>  Free non-state education </h2><br>  In this format, there are educational initiatives such as Computer Science Center and the School of Data Analysis (SAD) of Yandex.  In order to study in these organizations, you need to pass a competitive selection. <br>  <b>Pros:</b> <br>  There is a training program. <br>  You can participate in training projects, take practice. <br>  <b>Minuses:</b> <br>  Diploma of non-state sample. <br>  Need to pass a competitive selection. <br><br><h2>  Paid non-state education </h2><br>  There are many training and retraining centers (including at universities) where, for reasonable money, you can learn, for example, to program in Java and develop sites in Python.  At the end you will receive a diploma that you have attended such courses. <br>  <b>Pros:</b> <br>  No need to pass the selection. <br>  Issue a diploma. <br>  <b>Minuses:</b> <br>  Diploma of non-state sample. <br>  Education is paid. <br>  Courses are mainly designed for retraining. <br><br><h2>  Second higher </h2><br>  This is a path that was quite popular at the time when I was studying.  Additional education, especially economics or law, could be a good bonus in the future.  But you can get a second degree in the adjacent area. <br>  <b>Pros:</b> <br>  Education is conducted at the university. <br>  Diploma of the second higher education. <br>  <b>Minuses:</b> <br>  We have to take unnecessary courses. <br><br><h2>  Self-education </h2><br>  This format is well known to everyone, but not everyone practices it =) <br>  <b>Pros:</b> <br>  You can do when and where it is convenient. <br>  <b>Minuses:</b> <br>  No diploma. <br>  You need to be very motivated. <br>  No one to ask if something is incomprehensible. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/218035/">https://habr.com/ru/post/218035/</a></p>
