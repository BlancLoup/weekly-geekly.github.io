Part 1</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Once upon a time (about 2 years ago) fate threw me on <a href="http://www.mamba.ru/">Mambu</a> .  Not at all in search of the second half, rather, it was a job assignment.  The task was quickly completed, but after that I did not leave the mamba.  The project became interesting to me exactly as a business, even if a stranger.  And all this time I was engaged only in the fact that I set up experiments there.  Not for the sake of some benefits, but rather for the sake of interest.  Today, I would like to share my observations with you.  I will write parts in which I will tell: <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>-</strong> About what the maximum leader rates are people (these are hundreds of dollars).  I present an interview with these people.  We learn who is more, as well as why and for what. <br><br>  <strong>-</strong> About cheating methods on the project.  How to go abroad and how it threatens.  There will be real examples. <br><br>  <strong>-</strong> About whom to live on Mamba well.  Who is very popular and what is the benefit of it.

      <strong>-</strong> And so much more. <br><br>  <strong>And today's article will be useful to women and interesting to men.</strong>  <strong>The tale of who is the most faithful of men, and how for the sake of the experiment I changed the floor.</strong> <br><br>  So, at some point, I (a masculine person living not in Moscow) wondered what popularity a perfect Muscovite could have on a mamba, and on what this very Muscovite could count. <br><br>  So I became Alina.  Why exactly Alina?  I do not know.  I also don‚Äôt know why Odintsov was exactly why I was exactly 25 years old, why I was financially secure and I love blowjob, and I would like to find a person for serious relations.  In general, all this was written in the "my" questionnaire.  To all of this was attached pictures of the very pseudohalines, taken from some foreign pornosat. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/fde/aca/c2e/fdeacac2e4fd42b0a5bd850e8c25adf8.jpg" width="400" height="600" alt="Alina in the country" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/231/69e/6fd/23169e6fdaa0e7395eb145c25e7aaf9b.jpg" width="432" height="620" alt="Alina in the kitchen" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><habracut text="    "></habracut><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/814/b00/c04/814b00c0456a54c4801dea1b45074ec4.jpg" width="432" height="617" alt="Alina in the kitchen" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/35c/fa7/a04/35cfa7a0487c8fb690781831d5ca1ab9.jpg" width="400" height="600" alt="Alina in the country" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  <strong>It was on a weekday, at about 2 pm.</strong>  What did I count on?  Well, of course I suspected that messages would come, but I thought I would have to wait at least a little.  In general, I did not have time to wait.  <strong>Messages went at a speed of 15-20 per minute.</strong>  <strong>These are real numbers.</strong>  I not only did not have time to answer them, I did not have time to read them.  After a couple of hours (when about 1500 messages were already received) a certain tendency was outlined, so it was clear WHO wrote.  People present at the project can be safely divided <strong>into 5 categories:</strong> <br><br>  <strong>1. Template makers.</strong> <br>  Those who write the same thing to everyone.  Stupidly copy the pre-cooked text and send it to everyone (or almost all).  Their messages do not indicate your name, there is no emphasis on your particular feature, photo.  Although at first glance it seems that it is written for you: <br><br>  ‚Äú <em>Hi.</em>  <em>I accidentally went to the site and saw your profile.</em>  <em>Listen, you're just lovely.</em>  <em>My name is Andrey.</em>  <em>I would like to meet you.</em>  <em>I do not know how you will respond to this, but I just like you madly.</em>  <em>By the way, you have super pictures, especially the first one I liked.</em>  <em>If you do not mind, write - chat.</em>  <em>By the way, I'm going to the cinema today :-)</em> ‚Äù. <br><br>  The percentage of these messages is more than half.  In any case, most people start dating this way. <br><br>  <strong>2. Lizuny.</strong> <br>  There is nothing special to say, just read an example of their messages and everything will become clear.  Let me just say that in my REPEATED experiments they are about 3-5% of the total number of people who sent messages. <br><br>  ‚Äú <em>Hi.</em>  <em>I can lick your pussy.</em>  <em>Is free.</em>  <em>I do it super.</em>  <em>If you want to call, leave a phone number</em> . " <br><br>  Now imagine that 3-5% is 30-50 messages of similar content from 1000. <br><br>  <strong>3. Producers and directors.</strong> <br>  Those who propose to make you a star of a pop genre, play porn, or another less decent work.  There are a few: 1-2%. <br><br>  <strong>4. Envious.</strong> <br>  Their messages are similar to the following: " <em>And fuck you need it here, the bitch in the capital is bitter</em> ."  There are few such messages, let's say no more than 1 percent, but what is interesting is the only category where Alina was written not only by men but also by women equally. <br><br>  <strong>5. Ordinary people.</strong> <br>  Those who write to you, do not offer anything vulgar, in general, the most adequate clientele.  And there are 30 percent. <br><br>  <strong>In principle, it would be possible to finish the experiment here, the result of which would be a qualitative assessment of the project visitors.</strong>  <strong>But I went further.</strong> <br><br>  Alina was a girl without pathos, sweet, friendly and harmless.  She communicated with everyone, even with those who were rude to her. <br><br>  As a result of communication in a couple of days, the thousands list of contacts was reduced <strong>to a couple of hundred</strong> .  These were persistent men who wanted to meet.  They offered to go to the cinema, go by car ( <em>and the car brand was almost always indicated by them immediately, apparently the calculation was made on the fact that a positive result depends on this</em> ), go to a restaurant or just walk around the city.  In general, the high cost of the proposals corresponded to the material welfare of the gentleman.  Some even wrote poems for this and painted a portrait from Alina‚Äôs photos. <br><br>  But Alina wanted to know what a person is capable of before the meeting.  All the rest she gave the task to come up with an inexpensive gift for her for 1000 rubles.  The men began to work fantasy, which mostly rested on the romance.  One of the original proposals was, I quote: ‚Äú <em>I know one cool place in the suburbs.</em>  <em>There is a cool nature and there is an old arbor.</em>  <em>Let's take the 1000 and the wine and good cheese and meet the dawn there</em> . " <br><br>  The experiment was nearing a denouement.  <strong>The last assignment was a request to vote for a blog that Alina led on another resource</strong> (a blog on this occasion was specifically instituted).  And here the audience from the cell dropped to a dozen.  The rest was just broke to do something outside the mamba without knowing the result (gives, does not give).  And those 15 people who remained did not demand anything, they simply did it in a friendly way that they would be asked, and Alina could ask.  And they did it for a month, after which Alina called each of them and said that she had problems and was leaving.  They understood and offered help.  Even after Alina left, they continued to write to her, already knowing that they would never meet.  And Alina answered them. <br><br>  <strong>I think the ladies are wondering who this wonderful tag is.</strong>  <strong>Where to find these?</strong>  <strong>To whom to pay attention when meeting?</strong>  So, to my surprise, the audience of these 15 people was not motley.  These were men from 35 to 43, middle-income ( <em>either well-earned wage earners, or small business owners</em> ).  ALL divorced, and many have one child. <br><br>  <strong>Apparently here he is a portrait of male fidelity.</strong> <br><br>  <em>PS</em> This is my first article for the project.  Unfortunately, I can only write to a personal blog, but I really want to collective.  I will justify your trust if you give me karma (without which I can‚Äôt write to the collective blog), and vote for the article so that it gets to the main page.  I do not ask to vote FOR if you did not like it.  Just if you like it - do not pass by.  In front of a lot more interesting. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/14178/">https://habr.com/ru/post/14178/</a></p>
