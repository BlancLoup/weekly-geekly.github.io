  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How do web studios make money on affiliate programs of SaaS services?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Friends, everyone probably knows that for Web Studios there are a lot of affiliate programs from CMS developers and hosting sites.  The first offer discounts on their boxes and customers, the second -% of monthly payments for hosting.  But this, as it turns out, not all ways to increase the average bill from the client and get additional income. <br><br>  In this article I want to talk about popular affiliate programs for Web studios and freelancers from various SaaS services.  And also about the launch of a new program from Kopini.  List of services, description and terms of cooperation under the cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So, here is a small list that we managed to collect.  I emphasize that we are talking only about solutions that work on the SaaS model. <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.insales.ru/">www.insales.ru</a> is an online store platform for business.  If you have a lot of customers with orders for online shopping, I recommend a closer look.  There is a reseller and referral program.  Remuneration from 25% to 45% of customer payments. </li><li>  <a href="http://www.megaplan.ru/">www.megaplan.ru</a> is a business management system (task manager, CRM, finance, etc.) It will not be easy for studios to sell, because  they usually come to the site, and not to automate the business.  Remuneration - 20% of sales. </li><li>  <a href="http://webim.ru/">webim.ru</a> is an online consultant service for the site.  There are no conditions for the affiliate program on the site, apparently individual.  Service with a beard, a lot of partners. </li><li>  <a href="http://www.moedelo.org/">www.moedelo.org</a> is an online accountancy service.  Again, the affiliate program is not quite for web studios, but if you can, you can offer it.  Remuneration of 15% of all payments and 500 rubles for every 50 users who register, after clicking on this link and completely fill out their data (TIN, address, current account). </li><li>  <a href="http://www.krible.ru/">www.krible.ru</a> - service communication with site visitors to increase sales.  Something similar to webim, but there are differences.  Pay monthly for each client 15% of their payment.  The minimum payment threshold is 2000r. </li><li>  <a href="http://liveoperator.ru/">liveoperator.ru</a> is a service for communicating with customers on a website.  Direct rival webim and partly krible.  The partner receives 25% of all payments made by his clients.  The only thing that embarrassed is that only the current LiveOperator client can be a partner.  Sly =) </li></ul><br>  <b>The result</b> .  The most interesting seemed to me affiliate InSales and online consultants (Webim, Krible, LiveOperator).  They are profiled and sell their products will be easier.  In addition, you can offer several solutions at the same time, which will harmoniously complement each other.  For example, if an online store has come to you, put it on InSales, hang up one of the online consultants + Kopini (about the affiliate program below).

    <h4>  Kopini affiliate </h4>  We have long thought about the feasibility of affiliate programs for our service <a href="http://copiny.com/">Copiny.com</a> .  But appeals web studios and advertising agencies with questions about the partnership confirmed that we are on the right track.  Description of the service itself can be <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/copiny/blog/113764/">read here</a> . <br><br>  Kopini offers 2 options for cooperation: <br><ul><li>  Reseller program.  You get <b>from 30% to 50%</b> of all payments for the first year. </li><li>  Referral program.  You get <b>from 20% to 40%</b> of all payments for the first year. </li></ul><br>  In both cases, working through a partner, the client receives a 5% discount on all tariffs.  The difference in the programs is only that in the first case you work more closely with the client and provide us with the contact person data from the client.  And in the second you can advertise the service on the site, blog, newsletter, etc., using a promotional code (the client will enter it during registration). <br><br>  Yes, by the way, an important point.  Partners themselves do not sell the service, they only recommend it to their customers.  All questions on setting up, integration, training Kopini takes over. <br><br>  The service is well suited for online stores as well as for company websites (windows, doors, furniture, travel agencies, etc.), online services and regular portals.  Everyone needs to communicate and receive quality feedback from visitors / customers. <br><br>  To become a partner, fill in the form <a href="http://copiny.com/partner">copiny.com/partner</a> or send an e-mail to partner@copiny.com. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> I did not find a single database or catalog of affiliate programs of this kind, so I collected them manually.  I could not find everything for sure, so if I missed something, write in the comments, add to the post. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/115199/">https://habr.com/ru/post/115199/</a></p>
