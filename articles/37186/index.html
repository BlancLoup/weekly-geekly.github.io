I share. <br>  Here on Habr√©, questions have already been raised about electronic document circulation, about the fight against corruption by computer forces, and so on. <br>  Add "five drops" in a common "puddle": <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>1.</b> Let us suppose that one of the leaders of a budget organization, in obedience to the appeals of the authorities, has <u>decided to automate the department</u> . <br>  He hires a programmer and sets him the task: " <i><b>Implement! Teach! ...</b></i> " Next come the promises of high salaries and rewards.  If everything is implemented, of course. <br>  The programmer goes at first satisfied.  Then, gradually, falls to the ground. <br>  The harsh truth of life begins to crush him almost the next day. <br><br>  It becomes clear that the authority of the programmer is not.  He was assigned to the department.  To help. <br>  He becomes extreme.  He is not the head of the department.  Only recommend, suggest, learn.  It can also, or rather, be forced to knock on careless workers - they say they don‚Äôt want ...! <br>  <u>Employees.</u>  These want a few things: <br>  - Turn a programmer into a typist.  That sat also bases filled from those folders in which they cannot understand.  Strikethroughs, wiping, cleaning, etc. <br>  - They want the computer to read everything by a single button.  Himself printed out.  "Licked."  They (the workers) will only put signatures. <br>  - They do not want the computer to do everything "chocolate" (see pp.), Because  they will be cut / fired.  Teas and coffees will have to be drunk with a smaller composition, but there may also be a new job to look for. <br>  - Most of all, they do not want to strain their brains.  Ltd!  This is such a tragedy, much horror. <br>  <u>Head of the department.</u>  " <i>We are fine. There is a programmer. He is responsible for automation</i> ." <br>  <u>Head of Enterprise.</u>  He thinks that it is a Chinar and is waiting for when it is possible to report higher. <br>  <u>Programmer.</u>  Seeing how things are going and looking through the prospect, he thinks: ‚ÄúBut you wouldn‚Äôt go all the way away ...‚Äù.  And leaves.  Clearly deciding more in budget offices does not work. <br>  Etc., etc. <br>  <b>Findings:</b> <br>  - It is necessary as in the army, <u>the chief is responsible for everything</u> .  Not a programmer. <br>  If you are the commander of a battalion, and you have been given a tank company, there is nothing to ask the company commander for the total span. <br>  - How to determine the number of employees in a budget organization? <br>  Very simple - you need to come to the accounting department and recalculate all accountants.  The total number multiplied by 100 and get the number of employees in the enterprise. <br>  But for programmers who have hundreds of lamers - do not determine. <br>  Those.  Accountants are clearly observing their solidarity.  We are not.  Yes, and heads of budgets. Structures part of the problem with the lack of staff positions.  So take ITshnikov for all sorts of ... <br>  I think you will agree that in most offices, people work only a few hours a day.  The rest of the time - teas, coffee, booze, shopping, discussings of clothes, perfume and so on.  The programmer also injects during the whole day.  Even at home. <br>  Not bad for those <u>who plan and determine the ‚Äúdensity‚Äù of programmers ‚Äúper kilometer of the front‚Äù to reconsider their approaches.</u>  <u>Do not produce bureaucracy.</u>  <u>Create more full-time posts for programmers.</u> <br><br>  <b>2</b>  You can talk about informatization for months, years, decades, a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/i_am_clever/30719/">link to my comment on Habr√©</a> <br>  And why not approach the purely "Canadian" hockey style - one throws the puck into the zone, the rest are thrown to finish. <br>  I concretize.  Why not publish the <u>norm. Act binding the contents of all the stands in the bodies of state power and m. Self-management publish in e-view</u> .  In the corner of each booth write email. <br>  If creating a site on some engine / designer does not allow stupidity, then at least in a blog.

      <b>3.</b> There are people who have <b>done very, very much</b> to <u>form the legal consciousness of the population</u> , for <u>accounting</u> in our country.  Yes, more than anyone did. <br>  These are the creators of ATP "Garan", "Consultant +", 1C developers. <br>  Without detracting from the merits of those who were awarded by Putin and Medvedev, I think that the people mentioned in this section <b>should definitely be encouraged with the highest awards.</b> <br>  This is my type of sentence. <br><br>  And set out thoughts just to share with fellow minds, to express tz.  about the need to raise the social status of ITshnikov. <br>  And, of course, I am sure that where the names of our leaders slip are sure to read. <br>  Can report, move, improve, get stuck.  :)))) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/37186/">https://habr.com/ru/post/37186/</a></p>
