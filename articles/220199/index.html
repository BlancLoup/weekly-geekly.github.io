  <section class="page js-page"><h1>C ++ User Group, meeting in Nizhny Novgorod</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello. <br><br>  Last Saturday - April 19, a regular meeting of the C ++ User Group was held.  This time we met in Nizhny Novgorod. <br>  82 people came to the meeting, and the participants were not only from Nizhny Novgorod: St. Petersburg, Moscow, Ryazan, Saratov, Cheboksary, Yekaterinburg, Veliky Novgorod.  It scares me a little that I registered, but the participant did not come from Irkutsk.  I hope everything is fine with him. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Briefly about the meeting </h5><br>  In March, I wrote to several companies from Nizhny who are developing C ++.  He offered to help in organizing the meeting, but none of them answered me.  I think this is strange, especially since programmers came to the meeting, including from these firms.  Anyway. <br><br>  The meeting was held in a room provided by UNN.  There were no speakers in the audience, so it was sometimes hard to listen to the speakers.  Judging by the reviews, this was one of the biggest drawbacks of the meeting.  Well, we will try to make sure that the next time this does not happen.

      Six reports were presented at the meeting. <br>  1. Denis Kormalev, <a href="">Qt.</a>  <a href="">How to survive in a minefield.</a>  <a href="">Tips for the sapper.</a> <br>  2. Evgeny Krutko, <a href="">Experience in the implementation of parallel computing technologies to improve the performance of numerical calculations.</a> <br>  3. Dmitry Prokoptsev, <a href="">R-links in C ++ 11.</a> <br>  4. Alexey Kukanov, <a href="">Concurrency in C ++: manage the application, not the threads.</a> <br>  5. Stepan Koltsov, <a href="">Mutexes and effective message passing.</a> <br>  6. Anton Potapov, <a href="">C ++ containers and multithreading: together or apart?</a> <br><br>  I tried to conduct a <a href="https://twitter.com/search%3Fq%3D%2523cpp%2520AND%2520%2523nnov%26src%3Dtypd%26f%3Drealtime">twitter broadcast</a> on the #cpp and #nnov tags, however, it was very distracting.  Later I will try to collect from them a full report on the meeting. <br><br><h5>  Some news. </h5><br>  I finally picked up WordPress at the <a href="http://meetingcpp.ru/">meetingcpp.ru</a> and now all announcements will be posted there.  RSS import is, I think that's enough.  The reports are posted on the website, the video will be later (I hope this week). <br><br>  Previously, I did not consider registration for an event to be important enough, but now I have changed my opinion and registration will be mandatory for all subsequent events.  First of all, this was done in order to make it easier to attract firms to cooperate: it can be said for sure how many participants were at past meetings.  In addition, as the number of participants grows, it becomes more and more interesting to track their geography.  Plus, I hope there will be fewer questions about the cost of participation. <br><br>  In the comments to the previous post, the question of choosing topics of interest to the community was raised.  I am still opposed to the community choosing from the reports provided, however, I will ask you to help you decide on the topics (the survey is attached). <br><br><h5>  Thanks </h5><br>  Thanks to UNN, Yandex and Intel for the help!  Without their support of this meeting there would be no.  Thanks to the speakers that they were not too lazy to come and share their knowledge on sunny spring Saturday.  Thanks to those who support advice and feedback.  Thanks to everyone who came! <br><br>  Upd. <br>  <a href="http://tech.yandex.ru/events/yagosti/cpp-user-group/">Video</a> from a meeting in Nizhny Novgorod is uploaded. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/220199/">https://habr.com/ru/post/220199/</a></p>
