In order to check the success of the unlock, it was proposed to enter the IMEI number of the device on one of the special sites.  Previously, everyone used imei.info or dev.mk.  In addition to the ‚ÄúLock Status‚Äù column, I noticed a line with the ICCID number and these are the numbers that interested me ... <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      What is an ICCID (Integrated Circuit Card IDentifier)?  This is an international sim ID.  These numbers are unique to each card and represent something like its serial number).  The number itself is usually printed on the plastic part of the sim'ki. <br>  Here is the typical ICCID decryption: <br>  ICCID: 89 7 01 99 1111XXXX607 3 <br>  89 - Permanent digits denoting the identity of a code to sim cards <br>  7 - Country: Russia <br>  01 - Federal network standard GSM-900 <br>  99 - Operator‚Äôs network (‚Äú99‚Äù corresponds to Beeline) <br>  1111XXXX607 - Card Identifier (IR) <br>  3 - Check digit, which is calculated by the algorithm of the Moon <br><br>  The most interesting here is the IR number.  This number is directly connected to the IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity) - the international mobile subscriber ID, which each GSM, CDMA or UMTS mobile user has.  When registering on the network, the subscriber‚Äôs station transmits the IMSI, by which it is identified.  Moreover, in rare cases (operator-dependent), the IR, IMSI, and telephone number either match or differ in a straightforward algorithm.  Alas, in the case of the same Beeline, such a link has not yet been established. <br><br>  OpSoSov definitely has a database with links between the IMSI and the number of a SIM-using subscriber, and if the operators gave access to it ‚Äúmere mortals‚Äù upon request, the subscriber who stole the iPhone could simply call its new owner (after his ICCID will light up on the Apple server when the phone is connected to iTunes) and ask you to return the stolen mobile phone in an amicable way. <br><br>  On the topic of the question, I decided to refer to the three largest OpCoSam of Russia in order to receive a comment from them.  This is how the request was formulated: ‚Äú... Is it possible, knowing ICCID, to obtain from the operator a cellular phone of the subscriber whose SIM card is currently installed in the phone?‚Äù <br><br>  The answer from Beeline is still no.  Megaphone ignored the question (asked a question during a straight line with Megaphone in LiveJournal of the user drugoi, there was no official answer). <br>  The only answer so far came from MTS: <br>  ‚ÄúBy contacting the MTS Company, it is possible to find out the phone number on ICCID (SIM-card number), but for this it is necessary to clarify the contract holder and his passport details.  Unfortunately, we cannot call a phone number without providing this data. <br>  We would like to note that if the question concerns stolen phones, then it is necessary to contact the law enforcement authorities.  Upon request, information is provided on other procedures. <br>  We hope that the information provided will be useful to you. ‚Äù <br>  In this case, the information is again not thick.  To find out the number of the owner of the phone promise, but only if you already know his passport data. <br><br>  Thus, while the Apple servers are storing and giving out free of charge information on the SIM card inserted in the phone, Russian operators are not yet ready to assist the user in this matter and assist in the potential search for his phone. <br><br>  If you have any thoughts on this issue - you are welcome in the comments! <br><br>  PS For the completeness of the investigation it would be very cool if someone prompts the worker a free IMEI cheker, which now gives out the ICCID number on the IMEI of the phone.  I googled for about an hour - the best that was found is <a href="http://iphoneimei.info/">iphoneimei.info</a> <br>  There, using the entered IMEI, the string ‚ÄúLast Activated SIM: Vimpelcom - Russia RUS‚Äù is displayed, which is obviously calculated from the ICCID, but the ICCID itself is not visible. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/210034/">https://habr.com/ru/post/210034/</a></p>
