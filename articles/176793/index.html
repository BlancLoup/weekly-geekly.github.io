I recently saw a laptop stand in the store ‚Äî sort of fan-cooled platforms.  The data of the miracle was fed through usb, they were spinning sluggishly, but they were cheerfully.  In our latitudes, the novelties always travel for a long time, the quality ones may not travel at all, but I suddenly decided to acquire one on the eve of a hot summer. <br>  So, I wanted to do it myself, and under the cut, what came out of it.  The process and many photos are described in detail, the ducks are present! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/58e/107/2b8/58e1072b8bf39a24f0d42c9646bee4de.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Principle construct </h4><br>  The main question that arose immediately - why feed the stand. <br><br>  <b>USB powered:</b> current limit of 100mA applied to the load.  You can run one low-power cooler, and the whole idea loses its meaning. <br>  On the other hand, the stand is powered by a laptop, and the concept of a portable device is preserved.  But I didn‚Äôt want to carry with me a laptop and a stand from the laptop in the era of tablets ... In general, I refused such a version.

      <b>Power from the adapter:</b> there are no restrictions on the current, you can even turn on the compressor, but there is an extra wire and adapter.  But I'm going to upgrade the workplace ... <br><br>  Laughing and realizing that I cannot draw energy from a vacuum, I decided to make power from the adapter. <br>  Since the rubric is called ‚Äúdo it yourself‚Äù, I started to google the power supplies.  I will not lie, my knowledge of circuitry is limited to Kirchhoff's laws, and the manufacture of the device had to be abandoned.  The choice fell on a <abbr title="Robiton with output current 1A">pulsed power supply</abbr> with adjustable output voltage to control the speed of the coolers, and because it is small. <br><br><h4>  Execution </h4><br>  For effective cooling, we need powerful enough coolers, but at the same time compact, so that the stand does not become overweight.  <abbr title="Gembird d8015sm-3">Fans</abbr> were purchased in the amount of 4 pieces (must be effective!), Due to the ratio of consumed current of 220 mA each, and thickness of 15 mm.  In the past, I have already used them, they seemed to spin quickly. <br><br>  The necessary fasteners were also prepared: small bolts for fastening the cover on the frame, <abbr title="Evroshurup galvanized secret head - it is written on the package, as I call it in Russian, I do not know">threaded for fastening the fans</abbr> to the cover, self-tapping screws on wood, terminal blocks for connecting the wires, and plastic ties just in case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/282/7f5/8e5/2827f58e5811aedd8f962d56dff074c2.jpg"><br><br>  The body wanted such that it was not a shame to use oneself.  <s>But I am a red-eyed man.</s> Therefore, after drawing the details of the drawing were ordered in a woodworking workshop. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/824/1ea/940/8241ea940872b76bfecf4cb07ef438ec.jpg"><br><br>  The master caught a good, old school, did well. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/549/da3/bf5/549da3bf54e7cdd69919346386ab5277.jpg"><br><br>  I drilled the necessary holes, fitted the screws, and assembled the case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6aa/0f9/7a6/6aa0f97a61fe63e964cd2c6a0841bcf9.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7c1/e81/cdf/7c1e81cdf50e5a318f82c29ff603849a.jpg"><br><br>  With cold welding, I smeared all the jagged holes on the tree and screw nests.  After hardening the weld processed it with sandpaper. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/491/e10/447/491e10447b4a9e450e36fae3a0d00265.jpg"><br><br>  For painting took a simple paint in a can, glossy.  It dries quickly, should not leave stains, scratches can always be quickly painted over.  Painted, let dry, put the cooler, put the wires in the tires, all strengthened.  Here's what happened: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/141/a33/bab/141a33babe11969451c238f0bf3f1759.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/de1/df1/2f3/de1df12f3070b300959fddfa8e077c52.jpg"><br><br><h4>  What is the result? </h4><br>  <b>Aerodynamics:</b> when I started to test the stand, it turned out that the gap between the plane of the table and the upper edge of the legs (10mm) was not enough, there was little air suction (despite the fact that there is a gap from all sides around the perimeter of the case).  If you raise the stand, the air flow feels increased by a factor of 2. It was an unpleasant surprise.  The design is too late to change, so that the corners have something to underlay or put up with. <br><br>  <b>Power:</b> this item is a success.  The result was a distributed fan in the frame.  The consumed current is 0.88A, with free air intake it blows very well. <br><br>  <b>Efficiency:</b> so that CSV does not suffer, but does not grow beyond measure, it is necessary to establish precisely whether the stand cools the laptop at least a little.  After all, blowing a plastic bottom of a laptop at a distance is somewhat different from blowing a radiator, which takes heat from the processor through thermal grease. <br>  I tested temperature changes like this: I turned on the laptop, I did not run anything on it.  He warmed up to 52 C, the cooler of the laptop stopped changing mode, a certain balance was established, and I turned on the stand.  For ten minutes I received a smooth drop in temperature to an honest 10 degrees.  This is quite a decent result for such a system.  Although, on the other hand, it shows that such a stand is more a decorative element of the workplace than a functional one.  This is also an honest conclusion for modern laptops.  If the laptop overheats, it will still turn off, and under extreme loads on the processor, the stand will not have time to cool it adequately to those 10 C. <br>  CPU temperature is measured with <a href="http://www.ocbase.com/">OCCT PT</a> .  The processor did not load it. <br><br>  <b>Features of the case: the</b> lack of experience in working with wood and paint made itself felt - a couple of paint stains, bubbling, a few badly smoothed lickers ... But not visible from a distance.  If someone wants to collect something like that - my advice to you is: do not make a wooden case, order it in any advertising office.  For a little money, you will be cut and bent a decent frame from a sheet of thick plexiglass, and then attach everything you need to it.  It will be a little futuristic, but you will save time and quality. <br><br>  <b>Dimensions: the</b> size of the plane of the stand - a little more than the size of a laptop with a diagonal of 15.5 inches.  Thickness - 30mm. <br><br><h4>  Budget </h4><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">If you want to do something like this, here's an estimate</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><table><tbody><tr><td>  Coolers, 4 pcs. </td><td>  400 </td></tr><tr><td>  Housing </td><td>  1400 </td></tr><tr><td>  Power Supply </td><td>  400 </td></tr><tr><td>  Paint </td><td>  300 </td></tr><tr><td>  Fastener </td><td>  200 </td></tr><tr><td>  Total </td><td>  2700 </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  Somewhat more expensive than the store, but a self-sufficient guarantee that nothing will fall off.  And if you fall off - not long to fix. <br></div></div><br><h4>  PS or what else </h4><br>  As a conclusion - after all they spin!  And cool.  Thank you for your attention, and finally <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Easter eggs, could not resist</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/218/40e/2fe/21840e2fee12b61c9cb5760d8266151c.jpg"><br>  When I was preparing the material, my old friend came into the picture to inspect the preparations for the assembly. <br></div></div><br>  I wish you success! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/176793/">https://habr.com/ru/post/176793/</a></p>
