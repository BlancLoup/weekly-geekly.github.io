And these prices are so <i>special</i> that they will allow them to get acquainted with the technologies of Nutanix, even those who still believed that with his budgets only the Russian server self-collection "shines" him. <br><br>  But first, what is the Discovery Kit. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The Discovery Kit program includes two models of the ‚Äújunior‚Äù segment of the Nutanix family, the NX-1320 model and the NX-1350 model.

      ‚ÄúThree‚Äù in the model number means that <b>three</b> node servers are installed in the 2U case of the system, the fourth slot is free and you can install another server node in the future, for example, if you don‚Äôt have enough performance or capacity of the cluster by purchasing her separately.  As I mentioned earlier, the minimum configuration for building a cluster is just three nodes.  Then you can add one node each; each node added to the cluster increases its disk space and adds a new virtualization host. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/079/827/ca7/079827ca73764ffa915f9b6a7daed141.jpg"><br>  <i>the figure is just 4 nodes in the block.</i> <br><br>  Model node server NX-1320 includes: <br><ul><li>  1x Intel Xeon E5-2620v2 processor (Ivy Bridge, 6xcores, 2.1GHz) </li><li>  Memory - 64GB </li><li>  HDD - 2x 1TB </li><li>  SSD - 1x200GB (Intel S3700) </li><li>  Network: 2x 1G Ethernet </li><li>  Usable space (for a cluster of 3 nodes): 2.59TB </li></ul><br>  You get <b>three</b> such servers. <br><br>  Please note that the nodes of this model have NO 10G, which means, among other things, that it cannot be included in a common cluster with older models.  Its scope is a separate cluster, for example, branches, small VDI (about 12-15 VDI users of the Knowledge User type (office users) per node), small farms of infrastructure servers (AD controller, etc) or, for example, remote sites for storing replicated from a ‚Äúlarge‚Äù data cluster.  This is the youngest model, and although it is functionally capable of everything that the ‚Äúbig‚Äù Nutanix systems can do, there is quite a bit of memory on it.  At least 16 out of 64G will be eaten by Nutanix for internal needs. <br><br>  Model node server NX-1350 is: <br><ul><li>  2x Intel Xeon E5-2620 processor (Sandy Bridge, 12xcores, 2.0GHz) </li><li>  Memory - 128GB </li><li>  HDD - 4x 1TB </li><li>  SSD - 1x400GB (Intel S3700) </li><li>  Network: 2x 1G Ethernet + 2x 10G Ethernet </li><li>  Usable space (for a cluster of 3 nodes): 5.65TB </li></ul><br>  This is an ‚Äúadult‚Äù model, up to 70 VDI users per node (these are 200 users per cluster), already quite productive server VMs, it is weaker in terms of processor and memory than our mainstream 3000 series, but with its performance on disk operations will be able to surprise even him. <br>  Discovery Kit is a real Nutanix, all honest, no small gray fonts and asterisks.  :) <br><br>  For example, why is one Nutanix NX-1350, consisting of three server nodes, enough? <br>  Using our <a href="http://sizer.nutanix.com/">publicly available Sizer</a> , I made the following calculation: <br>  One NX-1350 is a platform for: <br><ul><li>  100 VDI Knowledge User profiles (2GB RAM, 1 vCPU, 40 disk IOPS, 10G gold image + 20G user data) in VMware View (c Linked Clones) <br>  plus here </li><li>  10 Small virtual servers (2GB RAM, 1 vCPU, 50GB disk, 100 disk IOPS) <br>  a plus </li><li>  10 Medium profile servers (4GB RAM, 2 vCPU, 50GB disk, 200 disk IOPS) <br>  plus here </li><li>  SQL Server OLTP profile, with 2 base instances, 250GB base, 2vCPU, 32GB RAM, 500 disk IOPS, 50/50 read / write, 40% working set. </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b0f/f28/81e/b0ff2881e74b4b01912ac4fccdd5a9b3.png"><br><br>  And that's all - on three nodes NX-1350. <br>  By the three nodes of our ‚Äúdatacenter in a box‚Äù, you only need a couple (for fault tolerance) 10G switches (Arista preferred, but the switch is your choice, Nutanix can use any Cisco Nexus, Extreme, that‚Äôs not important to us), and you get ready datacenter ‚Äù, where you can upload VM images and deploy them to production. <br><br>  Restrictions on promo are simple: the Discovery Kit can only be purchased by a new client for a company, that is, it has not yet bought it, and no more than two systems are ‚Äúin one hand‚Äù (a total of 6 nodes). <br>  All the rest is like in ‚Äúadult‚Äù systems, including support for any of the three hypervisors (VMware, Hyper-V or KVM), and all software features available for the installed license.  That is, this is not some limited edition, with which then there is no place else, this is a full-fledged, if not superpowerful system, which can then grow by adding nodes (including another type) and thereby increasing its productivity. <br><br>  And now, in conclusion - the most important. <br>  You all know that there is not, not a single vendor, not a single post about <i>enterprise</i> iron, in which you would not be asked in the comments ‚Äúhow much does it cost?‚Äù Next, there usually representatives of the vendor start telling that the technology is supposedly complicated It is not easy to calculate the price, it is not customary to call the price publicly for various <s>foolish</s> reasons, and the blah blah blah and ‚Äúcall‚Äù. <br><br>  We do not change the policy for large projects (which really need to be discussed and considered for each specific case), but for the Discovery Kit everything is much simpler. <br><br>  Here, now, Nutanix (through partners) is ready to take, and to name the price for all of the above, after our local partners have calculated all the overhead costs (logistics / customs / VAT).  Without any ‚Äúcall‚Äù, without any ‚Äúthe price is determined by the local partner <s>(having previously felt the thickness of your wallet)</s> ‚Äù.  Right now, the final price for the final buyer, <b>from a warehouse in Moscow, on the terms of DDP, delivery, customs clearance and VAT are included in the price</b> .  The final price.  Point. <br><br>  So, the price for the Nutanix NX-1320 Discovery Kit (with Starter license) and the year of support for the Gold level (standard) is <b>25,750 USD</b> .  For a couple in one hand (the maximum amount for this promo) - <b>47,200 USD</b> . <br>  The price for the Nutanix NX-1350 Discovery Kit (with Starter license) and the year of support for the Gold level (standard) is <b>USD 35,750</b> .  For a couple - <b>67 200 USD</b> . <br><br>  Now you know everything.  :) Wellcome to the comments and, of course, for the discovery of whales! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/254101/">https://habr.com/ru/post/254101/</a></p>
