  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Commentary on the article "Children" or again on the teaching of computer science</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I read the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/the_future_is_here/55307/">article</a> ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/the_future_is_here/39616/">beginning</a> ), in each line I saw ‚Äúmy‚Äù children. <br>  I wanted to write a comment, but it somehow imperceptibly turned into an article. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Introduction </h4><br>  Sitting in computer science classes at school I thought only about one thing: ‚Äúwhy are they needed?‚Äù I went because I had to report for the passes, and somewhere deep in my heart I hoped to hear something not about MS Word and MS Excel.  At one of these lessons, I decided that I would become a computer science teacher and would teach children, not applications, but something really needed.  How much more did I have to learn about <u>what</u> the education system is ... as I was naive. <br><br><h4>  To teach or not to teach? </h4><br>  Needless to say that in ped.  Does the university teach computer science not much better than at school?  And not only teachers are to blame for this.  Among them there are enough of those who know not only the content of GOS "for show", but really <u>know</u> their subject, are engaged in the development of applications / devices.  I will not give their names so as not to offend the others.  It is better to write a thank-you note after graduation to the university management with a request to mark them and financially reward them.  Guilty try to find the end of the article. <br>  In September, the opportunity to earn some money in one of the city colleges.  ‚ÄúThat's it!‚Äù, I thought, and ped.  practice was on the nose. <br>  I was immediately delighted that I would have to write a set of documents on 2 disciplines (program, CTP, etc.) <br>  The college is a classic SPOU, where students are treated like children and the atmosphere is as close to school as possible.  Who knows what is the relationship in the team of teachers of the school, where women mainly work, he will understand what kind of life there is. <br>  I "got" the students of the 3rd and 4th courses, some of them were older than me. <br>  I went to the first lesson like for a holiday ... 1 student sat in the audience.  He met me with a surprised look that asked me 3 questions: ‚Äúwhat ...?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù And ‚Äúwhat do you want?‚Äù ... Almost the whole group came to the second lesson and everyone had an address written on their forehead, which I should go with my networks. <br>  With the 3rd course it was easier, but in their eyes there was a clear unwillingness to begin to study computer science in the last 2 years of study.  And the teacher, in addition, only a year older ... <br>  As time went on, couples passed in a constant battle for silence ... A pronounced reluctance to understand computer science as "a set of MS Office applications and what can be created in them" on my part, and a reluctance to perceive material, supported by the lack of basic knowledge of the disciplines preceding mine student parties have done their job.  By February, couples began to be perceived as something unpleasant and inevitable. <br>  It is my fault that I could not interest students in my discipline.  I didn‚Äôt have enough experience, somewhere I didn‚Äôt have enough authority, after all, the age difference between the teacher and the ward plays an important role.  But, like the author of the article, the comment on which has quietly grown into an independent article, I got a good lesson.  During this academic year I learned more about teaching than in the previous 3 years at the university. <br>  And if, as a schoolboy, I, like all classmates, blamed the informatics teacher in all the horror that we learned in class, then after visiting the other side of the barricade I changed my mind and think that there is a way to correct the situation ... <br>  Next year, I hope to finish college.  ‚ÄúTeacher‚Äù is not just a profession, it is a big responsibility for the wards you taught / did not teach something.  I am not afraid of responsibility, I don‚Äôt know if I can realize what I wanted in school. <br>  To feed the family teachers have to take 2-3 rates.  Increasing the number of rates has a negative effect on the ped.  process. <br>  This applies not only to teachers of computer science.  The state must ensure the normal existence of teachers (as well as medical professionals, law enforcement officers, etc.) because the future of the country depends on them.  This is a common truth, which, alas, our officials do not want to notice. <br><br><h4>  3 steps to ‚Äúit revolution‚Äù in education </h4><br><ol><li>  Upgrading faculty. <br>  Already I hear a bunch of cries that today's teachers also need to eat, and not to live on retirement. <br>  I do not speak about all polls.  We need young teachers of those disciplines that are related to IT.  With all due respect to the doctors of science, they, for the most part, are not able to keep pace with the development of IT. <br>  If we say that the older generation needs to ‚Äúretire‚Äù, the state is obliged to provide them with normal living conditions (social package, high pension). <br>  IMHO it is better to supplement them with young professionals who will help them, eventually becoming their full replacement. <br>  We have one teacher.  I have not met a man who would know his subject more than him, who would love his subject more than he.  But due to age, this teacher cannot as quickly grasp all that is new that appears in the ‚Äúworld of computers‚Äù.  One of the lessons was almost disrupted due to the fact that MS Office 2007 was installed on the laptop, instead of the expected 2003. The assistant would then be an indispensable help to the teacher. </li><li>  Change of state educational standard <br>  Have you read STO?  I read ... the hair on my head stood on end ... And the program should be made in accordance with it, and children should be taught strictly according to the program. <br>  Unfortunately, I can‚Äôt quote from the standard now, but if it is interesting for habra people, I will try to find it.  It seems that CRP was a person very far from IT. <br>  IMHO, ideally, the compilation of GOS should be entrusted to habra people (I do not know of any other IT community of this level), then they should be given to teachers for editing, and after that, they should correct what teachers have fixed or overlooked. </li><li>  Organization of courses for teachers, with a system of public evaluation of these courses. <br>  Courses are needed to explain to teachers that the PowerPoint file is not a presentation, but a visual aid, that the indents by ‚Äúinteriors‚Äù are evil, that the hyphen sign instead of a hyphen is bad, that ‚Äúhacking the school server‚Äù aka the teacher‚Äôs computer is not a crime for which you need to restrict children access to computer audiences ... etc. <br>  The public should evaluate the quality of these courses so that there are no such masterpieces: <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/andrey.ocelot/Intel">screenshots of PowerPoint slides and MS Word documents from the ‚ÄúIntel‚Äú training for the future ‚Äù‚Äù CD</a> </li></ol></div>
