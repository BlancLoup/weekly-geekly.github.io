Almost every week in Russia and around the world blockchain-hackathons took place.  The beginning of April was especially dense, when almost simultaneously passed the hakaton, grandiose in its crowds, for more than 700 participants in the Netherlands Groningen - and the hakaton that distinguished itself already by the size of the prize fund of $ 15,000 <a href="https://binarydistrict.com/ru/courses/blockchain-hack">in Moscow</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5e/k1/aq/5ek1aq91jae6jdlosjpes8p3pdw.jpeg"><br>  <i>Moscow, Lucerne, Lisbon and Buenos Aires - we light around the world</i> <br><br>  But the closer to the summer, the fewer events ‚Äî there would be enough fingers on the hand of my Trudovik to recount events until the end of July.  So, we are able to put them in one review. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  May 17‚Äì19, Switzerland: Melonport Hackathon </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nj/vq/ba/njvqbayiiwb_u-c10zfvye0cvn4.png">

      The organizer of the <a href="http://hackathon.melonport.com/">Melonport Hackathon,</a> held in the Swiss city of Lucerne, is the <a href="http://hackathon.melonport.com/">Melonport</a> broadcasting hedge fund of the same name, so the main theme of the hackathon will be the construction of systems for managing cryptoactive assets.  The main prize is 25,000 Swiss francs, which will be paid in the cryptocurrency of the MLN (Melon) fund itself, the current rate of which is <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/melon/">~ $ 63</a> . <br><br>  Additional prizes of 2500 francs will be awarded to the winners in the categories UX, Front-end design, Compliance Integrations, Asset Managers and Freestyle.  So if you are somewhere in Lucerne in a couple of days, it‚Äôs worth a look. <br><br>  <a href="https://ahmadafandi.typeform.com/to/cHfkDg">Registration for the hackathon Melonport</a> . <br><br><h3>  May 19‚Äì20, Russia: Proof-of-Skill </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oi/jw/2k/oijw2kmv7myyiv1ukfnevvqiexm.png"><br><br>  The next hackathon will help many of our readers decide <u>where to go in Moscow</u> .  The event with the talking title <a href="https://bankexfoundation.org/hackathon">Proof-Of-Skill</a> will be held May 19‚Äì20 in the Co-working Workstation in Gorky Park.  The aim of the hackathon is to declare ‚Äúthe search for new areas of use for the blockchain‚Äù  At the same time, the organizers promise serious tasks, and not just ‚Äúlet's fix the blockchain and see how it flies‚Äù, and the decisions of the participants must comply with the principles of Open Source. <br><br>  Prizes for the first place - 128,000 rubles, for the second - 64,000 rubles, and for the third, as it is easy to guess - 32,000. And someone else will receive 32,000 rubles as a special prize from the main partner of the hackathon - BANKEX Foundation. <br><br>  Of course, with a <s>Nazi gold</s> prize in Lucerne, this hackathon cannot, but most will not have to go that far.  If you are coming this weekend in Moscow, without any special plans, but with fresh ideas in your head - why not stop by. <br><br>  <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/Bkvb8OGb7nQjjc1B3">Register for the hackathon Proof-of-Skill</a> . <br><br><h3>  May 21‚Äì25, Russia: Russian Blockchain Week 2018 </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4b/ij/wd/4bijwdkypgd9hfmtaj_olmvr_tw.png"><br><br>  For those Muscovites who were not allowed to get into the Proof-of-Skill, fate has already prepared another chance to hijack this spring.  Another <a href="http://blockchainweek.moscow/hakaton.php">hackathon</a> will take place on May 22‚Äì23 within the Skolkovo <a href="http://blockchainweek.moscow/">Russian Blockchain Week 2018</a> .  His topics include the development of smart contracts, trading robots using artificial intelligence and sidechains of the main blockchains (cases, architecture, solutions).  For the victory, the organizers promise 100,000 rubles, and 50,000 rubles each - for the second and third places. <br><br>  <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1r2O5BE0e7TushtsUCatJG9kDh_orIuhRPCfQsyj6kms/viewform%3Fedit_requested%3Dtrue">Register for the hackathon of Russian Blockchain Week 2018</a> . <br><br><h3>  May 25‚Äì27, Argentina: ETH Buenos Aires </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fv/ez/7w/fvez7wldobgpqvumjw082jbevt8.png"><br><br>  This is where the large hackathons in Russia end, and the next big event awaits us already in Argentina, where from 25 to 27 May the hackathon <a href="https://ethbuenosaires.com/">ETH Buenos Aires</a> dedicated to Ethereum development will take place.  Unfortunately, registration for it has already been closed, but it will be possible to see how it is done in Argentina using an online broadcast or recording. <br><br>  Registration is closed. <br><br><h3>  June 6‚Äì13, United Kingdom: LONDON FINTECH WEEK 2018 </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3y/vp/vr/3yvpvrv669oo0fs0wbjdpac25k8.png"><br><br>  <a href="https://www.fintechweek.com/">LONDON FINTECH WEEK 2018</a> , of course, also includes a <a href="https://www.fintechweek.com/page/1318041/hackathon">hackathon</a> from 8 to 10 June.  Its theme is quite blurred: projects of social and financial importance.  On the prizes, too, there is no specific information, but promises at least ¬£ 1,000 per team.  Organizers expect that from 300 to 500 developers will take part in the hackathon - so the event promises to be large. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.fintechweek.com/page/1318041/hackathon">Registration for hackaton LONDON FINTECH WEEK 2018</a> . <br><br><h3>  June 29 - July 1, Portugal: Chainhack </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ld/vq/er/ldvqer-7n9qqq9_pncqhyta5q48.png"><br><br>  In late June - early July, the <a href="https://blockchain-hackathon.com/">blockchain conference Chainhack</a> will be held in Lisbon.  The hackathon theme is both simple and complex: you need to build your own blockchain.  50 hours is allotted for this, after which the teams present their achievements.  According to the organizers of the <a href="https://chainsmiths.com/">chains</a> , about 200 people will participate in the event. <br><br>  The prize for the first place is quite impressive - 15 000 euro.  The second and third places will receive 5,000 and 3,000 euros, respectively.  Therefore, if you are in Portugal at the appointed time - it is worth a look.  Moreover, the next major hackathon announced by blockchain technology will be held only in the fall. <br><br>  <a href="https://blockchain-hackathon.com/">Registration for chainhack hackathon</a> . <br><br>  It is likely that during the summer there will be some other events, but now there are not so many of them.  So, if you want to participate in the blockchain event - it's time to buy tickets for the plane or travel ticket on the subway (an option for MSK residents) and get ready to go.  It is likely that until the end of August, new chances to try yourself as a hacker will no longer turn up. <br><br><h3>  Bonus Track: October 5‚Äì8, USA: cryptochickshackathon </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/82/a-/jw/82a-jw3vlsfhn_4cmkwjofxkd4q.png"><br><br>  The timeliness of the announcement of this October event hints that there are no longer ‚Äúsweet remnants‚Äù waiting for their guests, but one of the main events of the autumn is planned.  And indeed, against the background of the global women's and prozhensky movement against harassment, #metoo, the cryptoChicks hackathon in the birthplace of the movement, and even in the most liberal city of America, acquires an almost human rights sound.  At the conference, which will be held from October 5 to 8, the doors will be open for everyone, and the hackathon itself, which runs in parallel, will be organized only for women developers. <br><br><h2>  Post in the comments if we missed some more interesting events to be aware of. </h2></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/374503/">https://habr.com/ru/post/374503/</a></p>
