Today we will talk about how to turn the project upside down, write a <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582-%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580/edkanhffbhbognfkkdodomkknnceampc%3Fhl%3Dru">new application</a> in 1 day, make sure that it is inevitable (3 days) and find a completely new application (5 days).  There are hardly many willing to repeat this marathon, but the story can be quite instructive.  And if you thought that such five-day shock events happen only to aspiring entrepreneurs, welcome under the cat to make sure the opposite. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  The first day </h4><br>  It all started with the fact that several months ago we wrote a simple application for the Google Chrome browser - <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582-%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580/edkanhffbhbognfkkdodomkknnceampc%3Fhl%3Dru">Market Navigator</a> .  They wrote for their own interest, as they say, on their knees.  <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582-%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580/edkanhffbhbognfkkdodomkknnceampc%3Fhl%3Dru">Market Navigator</a> allows you to get information about the price of goods in other stores.  When you click on the application icon in the browser, a window opens showing the prices for these goods in other stores. <br><br>  Since the data on products are taken from Yandex Market, the application can be considered as a simplified version for very lazy users.  The application window displays the most necessary data on the product and price, and the product name is taken from a page opened in the browser using a simple algorithm.

      Despite the partial duplication of the functionality of the super-popular Yandex Market in Russia, the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582-%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580/edkanhffbhbognfkkdodomkknnceampc%3Fhl%3Dru">Market Navigator</a> application is an opportunity to instantly provide the buyer with product information on the online store page (availability, reviews, specifications, price) without having to open Yandex Market and search there. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b28/233/a2b/b28233a2bfbd0e24c0a41db392f3c42b.png"><br><br><h4>  Third day </h4><br>  At this point, the description of the application functionality could be completed, since there was nothing special about it.  Similar applications, frankly, is not enough.  Yes, and Yandex Market itself, as an option, wins due to its exceptional popularity. <br><br>  We needed to come up with something special.  Add functionality that is not found anywhere else.  Stand out from the competition and offer the user a really useful solution.  Here it should be said that we had a successful experience in the online lending market, so that the decision suggests itself. <br><br><h4>  Fifth day </h4><br>  Now in some online stores the opportunity to purchase goods on credit.  The demand for this service on the part of buyers is quite large: from 5 to 10 credits per day are processed in an online store with 5,000 unique traffic per day.  That is, the conversion is from 0.1% to 0.2%.  Bankers have been rubbing their hands for a long time, estimating how many credits could be issued in the largest online stores with a visitor / application conversion of up to 0.2%.  But the service ‚ÄúBuy on credit‚Äù has not yet become quite popular - there is only one out of 10 online stores that can buy on credit. <br><br>  Having among our own successful projects an online lending service, we were able to add to the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582-%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580/edkanhffbhbognfkkdodomkknnceampc%3Fhl%3Dru">Market Navigator</a> application the opportunity to buy any goods in any store on credit without leaving home. <br><br><h4>  How it works? </h4><br><ol><li>  On the product page that you would like to purchase on credit, you click on the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582-%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580/edkanhffbhbognfkkdodomkknnceampc%3Fhl%3Dru">Market Navigator</a> application icon. </li><li>  Immediately under the name of the product press the button "Buy on Credit". </li><li>  In the appropriate fields enter e-mail, full name and telephone. </li><li>  Click on the button "Submit a request". </li></ol><br><br>  That's all!  Your application for purchase on credit has been successfully accepted.  Within a few minutes a loan officer will contact you and conduct a full survey.  Then the profile will be sent to the bank.  Within an hour, the loan officer will call you back and give you a decision on the loan, as well as agree on the terms and procedure for signing the loan agreement. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/49f/3fe/4f4/49f3fe4f4f04e7c33bd5b455becfb4be.png"><br><br>  A representative of the online store will contact you within two days after the loan agreement is issued to confirm payment for the goods and to agree on the terms of delivery.  That's all!  Congratulations.  You bought goods on credit. <br><br><h4>  Why can you always need <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582-%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580/edkanhffbhbognfkkdodomkknnceampc%3Fhl%3Dru">such an application</a> ? </h4><br><ol><li>  <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582-%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580/edkanhffbhbognfkkdodomkknnceampc%3Fhl%3Dru">Market Navigator</a> allows you to provide the widest selection of goods for purchase on credit </li><li>  You can buy on credit in the store in which you prefer. </li><li>  Credits are available without down payment. </li><li>  Favorable loan conditions </li><li>  Depending on the region, credit products of Russian Standard, Home Credit, OTP Bank, Renaissance Capital, Alfabank are available. </li><li>  High probability of loan approval </li><li>  Free delivery of a loan agreement </li><li>  1 day loan decision </li></ol><br><br>  From June 21 to August 21, 2013, the possibility of sending an application for a loan through the application worked in test mode.  During these 2 months, we have worked through most of the controversial issues related to delays, logistics, returns and so on.  Currently, the Call Center processes more than 100 requests daily, sent by users of the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582-%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580/edkanhffbhbognfkkdodomkknnceampc%3Fhl%3Dru">Market Navigator</a> application.  We hope that our application <s>will pick up 256 thousand installations</s> will be useful to buyers.  And we plan to introduce two nice bonuses for our customers: free shipping and a discount for the second purchase;) But about that next time.  All good and to new meetings. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/190930/">https://habr.com/ru/post/190930/</a></p>
