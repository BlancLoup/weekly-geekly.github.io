      He published more than 300 scientific more than 150 other works.  Einstein is recognized as the father of modern physics and, perhaps, the most successful scientist. <br><br><h4>  10 tips from Einstein </h4><br><br><h5>  1. Be passionate </h5><br>  <i>‚ÄúI don't have any special talent.</i>  <i>I'm just a passion as curious. "</i> <br><br>  What excites your curiosity?  I am interested in the reasons for the success of some people, and the failures of others, which is why I spent years learning how to achieve success.  And what is most fascinating you?  Your curiosity moves you towards success. <br><br><h5>  2. Perseverance is priceless. </h5><br>  <i>‚ÄúAll this is not so because I'm so smart.</i>  <i>This is all due to the fact that I have not given up for a long time in solving the problem. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  Thanks to his perseverance, the tortoise fell on the ark.  And will you persist all the time until you reach your goal?  It is said that the value of the mail is that it ultimately always delivers the parcels to where they were sent.  Be like the mail, achieve your goal. ( <i>A</i> bad <i>example nowadays - approx. Per.</i> ). <br><br><h5>  3. Focus on the present </h5><br>  <i>"Any man who can drive safely while kissing a pretty girl simply does not pay enough attention to the kiss."</i> <br><br>  My father said that it is impossible to simultaneously ride two horses (with <i>one ass on two chairs - approx. Trans.</i> ).  I love to say - you can do anything, but not anything.  Learn to focus on the present, give all the attention to what you are doing now. <br><br>  Focused energy is power, and it is she who allows you to escape from failure to success. <br><br><h5>  4. Imagination is powerful </h5><br>  <i>‚ÄúImagination is everything.</i>  <i>It can show us in advance how events will develop.</i>  <i>Imagination is more important than knowledge. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  Do you use your imagination during the day?  Einstein said that imagination is more important than knowledge!  Your imagination shows you in advance your future.  One day, Einstein said: "The true manifestation of the mind is not knowledge, but imagination."  Do you strain your ‚Äúimaginary muscles‚Äù during the day?  You should never forget such a powerful thing. <br><br><h5>  5. Make mistakes </h5><br>  <i>‚ÄúA person who has never made mistakes has never tried to do anything new.‚Äù</i> <br><br>  Never be afraid to make a mistake.  Error is not a failure.  Mistakes can make you better, smarter and faster, but only if you accept them correctly.  Discover the power of making mistakes.  And, as I said it before, and I will say now - if you want to achieve success, you need to increase the number of your mistakes three times.  ( <i>Russian analogue - ‚ÄúThe one who does nothing is not mistaken‚Äù - note. Trans.</i> ) <br><br><h5>  6. Live the present </h5><br>  <i>"I never think about the future - it comes here and now."</i> <br><br>  The only way to get into the future is to live solely on the present. <br>  It is impossible to change yesterday or tomorrow at the moment, so it is very important to direct all efforts to the present.  What matters is the time in which you are. <br><br><h5>  7. Give meaning </h5><br>  <i>"One should strive to be meaningful, not successful."</i> <br><br>  Do not waste your time trying to become successful, take all your time with value. If you are significant, then you will be successful. <br>  Discovering all your talents and abilities, learn how to use them, in the way that will be most beneficial for you. <br><br>  Become meaningful, and success will find you. <br><br><h5>  8. Do not wait for different results. </h5><br>  <i>‚ÄúIt's crazy to do the same thing over and over again, and at the same time wait for different results.‚Äù</i> <br><br>  You simply cannot do the same thing day after day, and at the same time expect a different result of your actions.  In other words, if you perform your duties in the same way, it does not mean that they will look different from time to time.  In any case, if you want to change something in your life, you have to take and change.  In order for your life to change, you have to change something, appreciating how you have changed your actions and way of thinking, we can understand how to change your life. <br><br><h5>  9. Knowledge comes from experience. </h5><br>  <i>‚ÄúPure information is not knowledge.</i>  <i>The real data source is experience. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  Knowledge comes from experience.  You can argue over a task as long as you like, but this will only give you a philosophical understanding of it.  To understand the essence of the task, you need to feel it for yourself by doing it.  And what is the conclusion?  New experience!  Do not waste your time walking around the bush, take and do it, and you will receive invaluable knowledge. <br><br><h5>  10. Understand the rules and win </h5><br>  <i>‚ÄúYou should learn the rules of the game.</i>  <i>And after that you will play like no other. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  Simply put, there are two things to do.  First, understand the rules of the game you are playing.  It does not sound like some kind of revelation, but it is.  Secondly, start playing like no other.  By doing this you will win! <br>  - </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/88787/">https://habr.com/ru/post/88787/</a></p>
