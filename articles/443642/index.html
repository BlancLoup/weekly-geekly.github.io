      During a joint presentation of the Senate and NASA in September 2011, it was announced that the projected cost of developing an SLS rocket would be $ 10 billion and $ 2 billion to upgrade the launch pad and other objects at the Kennedy Space Center.  In October 2018, NASA's inspector general announced that the program is expected to cost about twice the original planned amount by 2021.  The cost of the launch was not officially announced, but, apart from the launch itself, NASA, after the development of the rocket, will have to pay Boeing and Lockheed the maintenance of the SLS infrastructure and Orion KK in the amount of 1.5-2 billion per year.  In general, if such a mountain of money gives birth to a mouse, then someone will have to be extreme. <br><br>  In fact, this is one of the highlights of the paradigm shift in space exploration, when the overall technological level of civilization has made possible the widespread commercial exploration of space, and the old, mobilization, methods of space activity are obviously ineffective. <br><br>  UPD1 (probably will be more). <br><br>  In the comments on another site there was information that NASA is continuing to study the issue of launching the Orion spacecraft on commercial rockets.  More detailed information is promised next week. <br><br>  UPD2 <br><br>  A couple of videos from YouTube. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XcPtQYalkcs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  This was planned for Exploration Mission-1.  It is possible that due to the replacement of the rocket, the plans will also change. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/75GTwWiCxjc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  All previously scheduled missions with SLS. <br><br>  UPD3 <br><br>  Some details have become known. <br><br>  NASA Administrator Jim Briddenstein made a speech, speaking to the Senate Science Committee.  Indeed, it is assumed to be duplex on two different commercial carriers.  Briddenstein did not mention which boosters will be used.  The two most powerful in the arsenal of the American launch vehicle are SpaceX's Falcon Heavy, which made its first flight last year, and the United Launch Alliance Delta IV veteran, who has 37 launches (and no failures).  Also, Brydenstein said that NASA can still use SLS to launch Orion‚Äôs first crew mission.  However, this option will entail a decrease in security, programmatic and political risks. <br><br>  The programmatic risk is that if a dual launch mission works and saves a significant amount of money to the space agency, the rationale for continuing to use SLS will be questioned.  There will be a strong incentive to cancel the SLS program and use the money planned for it to speed up NASA‚Äôs plans to return the American astronauts to the moon. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.parabolicarc.com/2019/03/13/bridenstine-suggests-dumping-sls-orion-flight-moon/"><i>Based on the source</i></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/443642/">https://habr.com/ru/post/443642/</a></p>
