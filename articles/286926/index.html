Business in Europe or how to wrap the crisis in their favor</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3e2/228/cfd/3e2228cfdb194e95a52413f4b91a3025.jpg"><br><br>  Friends, we entered the European market and we are in a hurry to share our experience with you.  About why it is necessary to develop precisely in a crisis and where to start European expansion - read under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  By tradition, let's start with the news.  <b>Three main events of March</b> : <br><br>  1. <a href="http://nii-kpu.ru/index.php/ru/">NII KPU</a> , a research institute for corporate and project management, <b>acquired 3% of Payler for $ 1 million</b> . <br>  The research institutes include experts and employees who participated on the client side in automation projects, processing industry and construction of facilities in companies such as Gazprom, Sberbank, Rosneft, etc., and now have joined together with a common goal to create a unique national school of project and corporate management. <br>  The company also owns its own print publication, The Practice of Management, and more recently we belong to its expert advice on payment systems. <br>  2. Now <b>Payler provides services to banks</b> .  Today, our partners are Nota Bank and Transstroibank, which connect their customers to Internet acquiring using Payler processing. <br>  3. <b>Payler‚Äôs European acquiring is</b> provided by Latvian Rietum Bank and Pasta Bank.  A few days ago we signed cooperation agreements and are currently actively integrating.

      In general, the European market is a kind of milestone for any developing company.  Payler can now help achieve this goal.  But first, a <b>little background</b> . <br><br>  Less than a year ago ‚Äî May 1, 2014 ‚Äî we celebrated the official launch of the then simple Payler payment gateway.  We had one client and very ambitious plans.  We continued to work on our products and services, while the waves of crisis rolled in with a whole new force - first, they dared buckwheat from the shelves, then TVs ... But we continued to work. <br><br>  There was a great chance to succumb to mass hysteria and stop the development of their projects until better times.  There were rumors of financial instability, ecommerce lost 30% of sales, sanctions and global stagnation appeared.  But the truth is that all this not only did not stop technological progress, but also contributed to its development - startups continued to multiply, gadgets - to be released, applications - to be downloaded.  The conclusion is shy: it turns out, is there no crisis in IT? <br><br>  We at Payler hold exactly this opinion.  <b>A crisis is an emotion that prevents a sober assessment of a situation</b> . <br>  This completes the lyrical part. <br><br>  <i><b>I have a business in Russia, I want to enter the European market.</b></i>  <i><b>What to do?</b></i> <br><br>  If you ask this question - congratulations!  So you also think that a <b>crisis</b> is the <b>best time for development</b> and a great opportunity to beat the competition at a sharp turn. <br>  Now, to accomplish this goal you only need to call / write to us.  What do we offer: <br><br>  1. At the initial stage, we will <b>provide free advice</b> on the legitimacy of various schemes of work - including abroad - and select the appropriate scheme for your business. <br>  2. Next, we will provide assistance directly with <b>the company's entry into the European market</b> : we will help with registering a company abroad and opening an account in a European bank. <br>  3. Connecting a business to Internet acquiring from a European bank takes 2-3 weeks.  In this case, you <b>only</b> need <b>to sign the contract in Moscow</b> , in the presence of our representative. <br><br>  And if you're still in doubt, here are three reasons for developing in a crisis: <br><br>  1. Most likely, <b>your competitors will not dare</b> to take this step.  It's sad, but true: most companies believe in a crisis and do not even want to hear about radical development. <br>  2. As a result - timid and <b>weak players</b> <b>will</b> gradually <b>lose their positions</b> .  This means that the niche will become freer and you can expand your influence in the industry. <br>  3. Do you already believe that strengthening positions in a crisis is a reality?  If yes, then <b>nothing</b> further <b>hinders</b> <b>your development</b> . <br><br>  We will be happy to answer all your questions and help with advice at hello@payler.com <br><br>  Do not stop there, all the frames - only in the head.  :) <br>  <i>Your payler</i> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.facebook.com/payler">Join us!</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/286926/">https://habr.com/ru/post/286926/</a></p>
