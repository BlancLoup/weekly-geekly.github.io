At the Sundance Film Festival, he announced that he would shoot a new episode on a regular film instead of modern digital cameras. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI would not be able to shoot‚Äú Star Wars ‚Äùin any other way except on film.  This is a historical film - everything that happens in it happened ‚Äúlong ago‚Äù.  Every time when I am going to shoot a historical film, an inner voice says to me: ‚ÄúThen, because there were no digital cameras‚Äù.  The director said that he shot ‚ÄúThe World of the Jurassic Period‚Äù on film, because he didn‚Äôt want the action scenes to look like a ‚Äúbattle between two computers‚Äù.

      He jokes or not, but JJ Abrams also filmed the recently released seventh episode on film, and the director of the next, eighth episode, will also use classical technology instead of digital. <br><br>  And if the use of film cameras looks quite real, then another request from the director turned out to be more strange.  <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/star-wars-episode-ix-shot-860188%3Futm_source%3Dfeedburner%26utm_medium%3Dfeed%26utm_campaign%3DFeed%253A%2Bthr%252Fnews%2B%2528The%2BHollywood%2BReporter%2B-%2BTop%2BStories%2529">Trevorrow said</a> that he had made a request about the possibility of filming the film "on the ground" - that is, directly in space.  ‚ÄúI asked if it was possible to make Star Wars movies for IMAX in space.  I have not been answered yet.  But after all, shooting in space for IMAX was already underway! ‚Äú. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the context of a return to the origins of filmmaking, we can recall the recent Tarantino film ‚ÄúAbominable Eight,‚Äù which was filmed not just on film, but on a rather old, widescreen 70mm version.  For example, in Russia, there were only one movie setups designed for 70 mm film, but most of them are in a non-working state. <br><br>  The Tarantino film with a 70-mm motion-picture of the Ultra-Panavision 70 format is now (in January 2016) being <a href="https://snob.ru/profile/25593/blog/102946">shown in the only Moscow cinema Oktyabr</a> .  It was not possible to find the complete operating equipment of a suitable standard, and for normal projection its elements had to be assembled from various film distributors. <br><br>  Colin Trevorrow - American director, screenwriter, producer and actor.  He is best known as a director, screenwriter and producer of such films as: "The Jurassic World" and "Security is not guaranteed."  In 2013, he was nominated for the Independent Spirit award for the best debut film. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/367791/">https://habr.com/ru/post/367791/</a></p>
