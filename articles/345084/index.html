    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Venkat Subrahmanyam</b> Java Champion, Agile-guru and speaker, who is being hunted by the organizers of all Java-conferences of the world, starts the conference with his <b>keyout ‚ÄúTwelve Ways to Make Code Suck Less‚Äù</b> .  Founder of Agile Developer, Inc., creator of <a href="http://agilelearner.com/">agilelearner.com</a> and professor at the University of Houston (the University of Houston), Dr. Subrahmanyam coached and was mentor to thousands of developers in the US, Canada, Europe and Asia.  Permanent participant of international conferences and author of books (.NETGotchas (O'Reilly), Programming Groovy (Pragmatic Bookshelf), "Practices of an Agile Developer" (Pragmatic Bookshelf) and many others. <br><br>  Venkat will give another talk on <b>Let's Get Lazy: Exploring the Real Power of Streams</b> .  Lazy computing is a feature of many programming languages.  Your code can benefit from them using lambda expressions and, moreover, using all the power of threads.  How to do it?  The answer is in the report.  There will be many examples from Haskell and Scala.  And deep immersion in Java to see how similar benefits can be achieved with lambdas and Stream API. <br><br>  <b>Baruch Sadogursky</b> will come to Minsk from sunny California.  JFrog Developer's Developer Advocate, DevOps guru, winner of the JavaOne 2011 and 2013 Duke Choice Awards, permanent presenter of the podcast ‚ÄúDebriefing‚Äù, architect, consultant, trainer, blogger and one of the most awaited speakers at conferences around the world.  They say his speeches are able to charge on the cleanest code.  Do you doubt?  <a href="https://dev.by/lenta/main/baruh">Read the interview Baruch and see for yourself</a> . <br><br>  Baruch will read his report with Evgeny Borisov, who will arrive at the conference from Israel.  Big Data Technical Leader in NAYA Technologies, Eugene is familiar with development issues firsthand.  Since 2001, he worked as a Java Developer, TeamLeader, Java Architect and Java Trainer, many and often gives talks at conferences and always considers the problem in several planes. <br><br>  Their report <b>‚ÄúThe Adventures of Senior Holmes and Junior Watson in the Development World‚Äù (The Adventures of Holmes and Junior Watson in the World of Software Development)</b> can hardly be called ordinary.  Imagine in my head sounds familiar music from the series about Sherlock Holmes. <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúSherlock, why does nothing work again?‚Äù</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>- It's elementary, my friend!</i>  <i>First, you are trying to run the fifth Spring on Java 7. Secondly, after a couple of months of using Groovy, you have completely ceased to respect semicolons.</i>  <i>Well and thirdly, the battery died in your laptop.</i> <br><br>  Holmes and Watson will uncover several riddles that you encounter in everyday development.  There will be tools, libraries and frameworks that perplex ordinary developers, leading to downtime, deadline delays and protracted depressions.  In this report, Sherlock and Watson save your forehead from facepalm and rake, which someone has already attacked.  To be continued ... on Voxxed Days Minsk. <br><br>  Yevgeny Borisov will also perform together with <b>Kirill Tolkachev</b> , Lead Developer at Alpha-Laboratory.  Cyril is a longtime fan of Groovy, Gradle, Spring and the Netflix technology stack.  He develops various banking APIs, works a lot with microservice architecture and knows DevOps methodology like the back of his hand. <br><br>  The joint report <b>‚ÄúBoot yourself, Spring is coming‚Äù</b> will reveal the main secrets of Spring Boot magic.  Kirill and Eugene will talk about the principles and conventions by which typical Spring Boot applications work.  And all the magic from the cylinder will turn into a much more transparent process.  Now you can not just enjoy the fact that everything works, but also understand the essence of the problems that arise, solving them without the help of an ambulance.  That is, if quite briefly. <br><br>  Another joint report, Kirill Tolkachev, will present with <b>Maxim Gorelikov</b> , a colleague at Alpha Lab.  Max is developing an API for mobile applications and a bit of security.  His element is a mix of Spring Boot, Netflix stack, and reactive libraries.  He experiments with all the infrastructure (logs, ci / cd, orchestration) and DevOps practices.  All the time in search of non-trivial approaches to development. <br><br>  Spring is no longer magic, but Spring Boot is still stigmatized with magic crafts.  But many people like it, especially for beginners!  In the report Spring Boot Starter - How And Why?  Cyril and Maxim will do this: <br><br><ul><li>  analyze examples of a typical company using Spring Boot, </li><li>  tell you where you may need your own starters, </li><li>  how soon the Inquisition comes for newbies, if they are thoughtlessly using ready-made starters, </li><li>  how independent Spring Boot is and what it means for developers. </li></ul><br><br>  The report is designed for practicing Spring (and better Spring Boot) engineers who have already encountered various difficulties in supporting the heavy infrastructure that is being developed using Spring.  No spoilers, only personal presence, only Spring Boot! <br><br>  <b>Philip Krenn</b> will come from Vienna.  Elastik Developer Advocate actively disseminates its knowledge of full-text search, analytics and real-time data, speaking at conferences and meetings around the world, and sprinkles reports with stories about Elastik products, databases and cloud computing. <br><br>  The <b>‚ÄúMake Your Data FABulous‚Äù report</b> will take a detailed look at the trade-offs of the FAB theory, touch on the CAP distributed systems theorem, and use concrete examples of compromise accuracy to teach how to optimize them for a specific task.  It will be difficult, but very informative. <br><br>  <b>Alexander Tarasov</b> , Odnoklassniki.  A talented engineer with extensive experience (10+) in the development of Java.  I know firsthand about microservice architecture, Docker and Spring Boot.  A fan of DevOps and extreme programming. <br><br>  Large projects make simple things difficult.  And nothing can be done about it.  You can't just take and make a feature available to all clients at once.  We'll have to conduct experiments manually, waste time and make mistakes.  In the report <b>‚ÄúAutomating experiments with Kotlin DSL‚Äù,</b> Alexander will tell you how Odnoklassniki decided to automate the experiments, why they chose Kotlin, rather than the classic configuration management tools (such as Ansible), why good DSL and tools are crucial for this task and what problems it had overcome so that everything works as originally conceived. <br><br>  <b>Oleg Dokuka</b> is well-known in the Minsk Java community.  Software Engineer from Levi9, he recently came to the Belarusian capital with a workshop.  Recently, keen on the development of distributed systems, uses mainly the Spring stack.  Since its inception, it keeps abreast of the framework and promotes Reactive-solutions.  Oleg is an active committer in Reactor 3 and the author of the book Reactive Programming with Spring 5. <br><br>  <b>‚ÄúHow to build Crypto Trading Platform with Spring 5 and Reactor 3‚Äù</b> is about a fundamental understanding of Reactive-approaches with Spring 5 and Reactor 3 and how to build / transfer Reactive System to a new Reactive Stack.  Oleg will talk about the general needs of the business, where these techniques work better and why, and how they can help solve complex problems with maximum efficiency.  During the report, a crypto-trading platform with the design of a standard application will be built.  In general, it will be fun. <br><br>  <b>Ray Tsang</b> will arrive from New York.  Java Champion and Developer Advocate in Google with extensive practical experience in cross-industry integration of enterprise systems and management.  He worked at Accenture, managing the development of full stack applications, DevOps, and ITOps.  In Red Hat, Ray specialized in middleware, big data and PaaS products.  An active contributor to open source projects such as Infinispan. <br><br>  His talk <b>‚ÄúDebugging and Troubleshooting Java-based Microservices in Kubernetes‚Äù</b> will be devoted to debugging applications in production.  Yes, it often looks like a detective.  Especially with microservices.  And containers.  In the cloud.  You will learn why Google spent more than 10 years on deploying container applications in Java, how to do it faster, how to diagnose and fix problems in Kubernetes. <br><br>  <b>Alexey Demin</b> Software Engineer in Pegasus.  Widely known in narrow circles, a bosom participant of Minsk mitaps <br><br>  More than 12 years working with Java server-side and Big Data.  The first real experience of using the Hadoop stack happened when all the products could still be counted on the fingers of one hand.  He is fond of distributed data processing systems and is always up to date.  I started testing new products before it became popular. <br><br>  <b>"Apache Beam: Unified Data Processing"</b> is a report about the most dynamically developing SDK and an attempt to standardize a processing model that is independent of the environment in which the code runs.  Is it possible to stop choosing individual positions and get access to everything at once within the framework of a unified approach and what should be sacrificed for this?  Alexey knows the answer. <br><br>  In the beginning of May, <b>Ivan Kruglov</b> spoke with keynote in front of 5,000 people at KubeCon and now travels to us from the Netherlands. Principle Developer from <a href="http://booking.com/">Booking.com</a> has extensive experience in writing various software.  Focused on high-performance distributed systems, network programming, algorithms, data structures, Linux / FreeBSD, C / C ++ and Go, but is not limited to them.  In his free time he likes to hack an open-source project, actively commits on GitHub and speaks at conferences. <br><br>  Report <b>"Service mesh for microservices"</b> : what is the beast service mesh?  Perhaps this is the next breakthrough for cloud-native apps!  Let's try to figure out what good it can bring.  Juicy examples of the construction of a dedicated layer from the practice of Booking.com and deepening into ideas, designs and implementation.  And it will be about L7 proxy and linkerd. <br><br>  <b>Alexey Fedorov</b> needs no introduction.  Java Champion, leader of JUG.ru - Java User Group in Russia, organizer of JPoint, Joker, JBreak and other Java conferences.  In the past, a technical evangelist at Odnoklassniki and an engineer at Oracle.  Speaker, blogger and interviewer. <br><br>  Report <b>"How Threads help each other</b> . <b>"</b>  Michael and Scott's non-blocking queue algorithm uses a very beautiful idea - in it, the threads that work with the queue "help each other."  This algorithm is used in one form or another in many modern platforms, including C ++ and Java. <br><br>  Chris Talinger, Software Engineer on Twitter.  Chris specializes in the just-in-time compiler for JVM.  It is thanks to him that Twitter uses Graal and decently saves, by the way.  He was involved in CACAO and GNU Classpath projects, then worked on the HotSpot JVM in Sun and Oracle.  And now Twitter, Graal and Hawaii. <br>  <b>Date</b> : May 26, 2018 <br><br>  <b>Time</b> *: 9: 00-20: 00 Location: Minsk, <a href="http://www.marriott.com/hotels/maps/travel/mhpmc-minsk-marriott-hotel/">Mariott Hotel</a> , 20 Pobediteley Ave. <br><br>  * The <i>exact time will appear in full age very soon.</i> <br><br>  Platinum Conference Partner - <a href="http://epam.com/">EPAM</a> <br><br>  General media partner - <a href="http://dev.by/">dev.by</a> <br><br>  Infopartners - <a href="http://www.jprof.by/">JProf.by</a> , <a href="https://bkug.by/">bkug.by</a> <br><br>  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/voxxeddaysminsk">Facebook</a> <br>  <a href="https://twitter.com/VoxxedMinsk">Twitter</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/345084/">https://habr.com/ru/post/345084/</a></p>
