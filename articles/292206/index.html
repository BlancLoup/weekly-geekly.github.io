It is possible that the new law will come into force from January 1 of next year, <a href="http://top.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/03/07/2015/55966f049a7947f52a25d0b5">writes</a> RBC.  Only 2 deputies voted against the law, there were no abstentions. <br><br>  Chairman of the Duma Committee on Information Policy Leonid Levin has already called the adopted document acceptable to all.  In addition, Levin believes that the law "will create an effective opportunity for curbing blackmail and harassment on the Internet for ordinary citizens, but will allow preserving socially significant information in search engines." <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At the same time, the co-author of the project, Vadim Dengin, said that this law would allow citizens to remove references to "filthy, disgusting information about themselves" from sites that are often abroad. <br><br>  It is worth noting that a large number of representatives of the Internet industry spoke against the law in its original form.  The main reason is the need to remove links to information that was published more than three years ago.  At the same time, the deputies rather quickly accepted it already in the first reading in the original form.  The bill was submitted to the State Duma on May 29, and on June 16, the lower house supported the document with a majority vote.

      True, by the second reading, the State Duma received 32 amendments from representatives of the telecommunications sector.  And 14 such proposals, it was decided to accept.  According to Sergey Plugotarenko, director of the Russian Association of Electronic Communications, about 80% of proposals from representatives of the domestic telecommunications industry were taken into account in the new bill.  ‚ÄúThe remaining 20% ‚Äã‚Äãare unprincipled moments.  We consider that the maximum number of offers is taken into account.  This happened due to the consolidated position of the industry on the inadmissibility of the document in its original form and due to the dialogue of the presidential administration, legislators and the industry, ‚Äùsaid Plugotarenko. <br><br>  The most significant change is the replacement of the need to remove references to reliable information about users with the obligation to remove references to information that has become irrelevant to the user.  This refers to information that "has lost its meaning to the applicant due to subsequent events or actions."  In order to remove such a link, the user will have to confirm the irrelevance of the information.  For example, officials will be able to remove references about themselves after the completion of the civil service, but they will also be required to provide a document confirming their withdrawal from the civil service. <br><br>  If the conviction is not removed (or not expired), it will be impossible to delete the link. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292206/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292206/</a></p>
