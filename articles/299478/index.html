    <blockquote>  Interestingly, about 5 years ago I came up with a new interface ideology for the operating system, code-named Magic, never got around to describe this matter in a normal text, which is sad but recognizable, as always, the problem is not done, the problem is not to score.  So, even then, traces of the future were visible, that we would come to a greater variability of interface management in fine motor skills, I actually came up with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcombining motor skills with the ‚Äúsemantic‚Äù principle of control.  Sooner or later, it is necessary to describe it all the same. </blockquote><br><br>  Let us return, however, to the chambers, treaties and patents. <br><br>  As I have already written, the camera is now doing a lot of things, including purely official.  For example, the front camera on the iPhone checks if you just waved the phone or brought it to your ear.  And if to the ear - it blocks the touchscreen.  And in the case of the Telegram - cut the voice recording.  Herself.  An automaton.  The card in the paper also can not enter hands, but just sfotkat. <br><br>  Let's go ahead.  With all sorts of payments, there is one big task - how to give a person the opportunity to pay for a purchase, even if he forgot the card at home.  And to be easier.  And then the guys from Amazon decided that you would hardly leave the house without a face.  So you can pay by face.  Not, <a href="http://pdfaiw.uspto.gov/.aiw?PageNum=0&amp;docid=20160071111&amp;IDKey=18EBA4B7FF4E&amp;HomeUrl=">naturally face</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d87/8e6/b53/d878e6b53fcf405eb2e104b92916661b.png" align="left">  We didn‚Äôt understand, already a patent or just opened a long-filed application, but, briefly, the topic is as follows: register your face on Amazon, attach it to the account.  When you have to pay for something, you look into the camera, the system makes sure that you look like (for girls there will probably be three photos - morning, afternoon and parade-hunting), after which it offers something to do - like wink, smile or show language .  Thus, they will struggle with the fact that they will show fotochki. <br><br>  In principle, a curious idea, only Dicaprio should not be registered in it, because half the world will start to show an ipad with MSQRD to the camera.  Jokes, jokes, but in principle can be very funny decomposed.  Like you walk down the street, two blondes come up to you, they say, ‚ÄúCan I stay with you?‚Äù.  And then such "please smile!"  And that's all, you bought them by car.  On credit.  Under 50% per annum.  Or from a drunken eye I made a selfie for myself, and the next day I woke up with empty bills and a bunch of incomprehensible purchases - purely lured the program.  In general, the growth of technologies here works in both directions - it is becoming easier to generate an image, and to map it to a real person, too.  It is clear that they will push a micromotoric into the algorithm, but even there problems - a different level of stress changes the nuances. <br><br>  But it will be interesting to see what happens in any case, at least methodologically.  Because if it goes and there really is the revolution that the <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/03/15/amazon-files-patent-pay-selfie/81808188/">press promises</a> us, that is, they will be able to do everything seyurno, but without a large number of false failures, then just as computer gloves are piled from the horizon, most physical identification carriers.  Why do you need a card when you can just confirm your account by looking at the camera? <br><br>  ¬© Gotovtsev, Mityagin </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299478/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299478/</a></p>
