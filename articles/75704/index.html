  <section class="page js-page"><h1>I worry! And I like it!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Five years from now, and maybe even earlier, when Google Wave becomes a daily environment for work and communication, my post will probably look a bit naive.  Probably something like that was experienced at one time by BBS users who we look at today with affection ... And yet I can't help but be delighted - I was really in a wave! <br><a name="habracut"></a>  Yesterday, at the beginning of the night, I got access to wave.google.com, and in the middle of it, a UFO flew to me and sent me to a habrahabr, as if hinting to write about it to the blog immediately. <br>  I have been following the wave since the summer and, in principle, I thought I had an idea about this project, but only having tried it in action, I really, as it seems to me, felt the power and potential of Google Wave. <br>  At the moment, it is the reflections on what it will turn into over time, that bring the greatest pleasure, since brakes and errors take place quite often, which, however, still did not affect my euphoria. <br>  Most of my work is devoted to working with documents - typing, editing, agreeing, approving, working with text arrays and databases, and very often you have to edit, roll back, add, remove, correct.  In my particular case, Google Wave is just a discovery.  Being familiar with the activities of lawyers, auditors, journalists, analysts I can confidently say that they will all be in complete delight of Google Wave.  Special admiration should be experienced by seconded citizens. <br>  I am sure that in the near future personal correspondence and communication will also take a wave - anyone will prefer to play, chat, chat, draw, share photo, video and audio content, as well as any files on their personal space rather than on the social platform, or same by e-mail. <br>  In the near future, Google Wave will certainly become the main habitat for Internet users, who will not even need to leave the wave because everything they need will be integrated (or available for integration) inside. <br>  The tremendous flexibility and intuitiveness of the interface allows you to adapt the wave to absolutely any goals and objectives. <br>  After swimming for a day, I felt an incredible excitement and agitation, in which all the users of Google Wave are staying.  However, the enthusiasm is mainly at the level of housewives.  Still, I read more or less serious thoughts and opinions on specialized forums and blogs. <br>  Overload depress.  Users are begging not to overload the body of the wave with messages and to rationally use scarce, yet still features.  In this regard, it seems to me expedient to hang up a chat at the beginning of the wave in order to cut off the flood and unnecessary questions right in it. <br>  Summarizing - even in the preview-form, Google Wave will be an excellent tool for me, for work and communication.  I'm better with Google Wave! <br><br>  Good luck to everyone, and I will go before bedtime, perhaps, I will plunge once more.  Have a nice swim! </div>
