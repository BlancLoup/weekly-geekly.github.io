The speakers will tell you what companies should do to cope with the increasing load, organize networking and ensure information security.  The conference is divided into eight streams, which include topics such as corporate network infrastructure, technologies for collaboration, information security, the Internet of things, solutions for telecom operators and the use of Cisco services. <br><br>  <a href="https://mhealthcongress.ru/ru"><b>M-Health Congress</b></a> <br><br>  <b>When:</b> April 3 <br>  <b>Where:</b> Moscow, st.
