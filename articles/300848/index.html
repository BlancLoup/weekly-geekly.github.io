  <section class="page js-page"><h1>As behind a stone wall: the story of Qihoo 360 Total Security and opportunities in the Russian market</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In Russian society, there has long been a bias towards Chinese products and goods as substandard.  The massive influx of cheap, and sometimes counterfeit products from the Middle Kingdom in the post-perestroika period, only reinforced these stereotypes among the masses.  And in fact, almost every one of us was confronted with Abibas frankly hack-up sneakers, with buggy electronics, and with the smell of "Chinese" plastic. <br><br>  But in the past five years, the situation has been slowly but surely changing - less and less unscrupulous imitations are found on the Pandawill, Chinese cars are gradually finding their niche in the market and even ideological fans, and giants like Aliexpress and Union Pay officially enter the Russian market. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e7a/549/b87/e7a549b87ed5561cd4e3fe8e7a434cda.jpg"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To many, it often seems strange to have a ‚ÄúChinese approach‚Äù to create their own services and software packages - and at first glance, this is the case: there are many solutions in the world, at least in terms of the quality and functionality of the Chinese‚Äôs own development.  The answer to this question, however, is quite obvious - in recent decades, the production of personal electronics and gadgets in China has grown by leaps and bounds;  A particularly significant event at the time was the entry of Huawei Corporation personal gadgets to the market, previously engaged mainly in the supply of industrial telecommunications equipment.  It was with the release of the first smartphones from Huawei in 2011-2012, the Chinese phones, finally, no longer perceived as substandard toys.

      The same thing, in turn, also applies to the software side of the issue: the growth in sales of iron naturally created a huge niche in a very isolated market for foreign software vendors ‚Äî and, in particular, for developers of mobile applications and security systems. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/554/4ec/c87/5544ecc874ce4a198921684bb1c08425.jpg"></div><br>  We are Qihoo 360 Technology Co., and we are developing integrated Internet solutions.  In 2014, our users were more than 400 million people;  Our products include a web browser, a search engine, app stores for desktops and mobile devices, as well as security and antivirus systems.  We briefly and will tell about the last today. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3693da">Prehistory</font> </h2><br>  The roots of Qihoo 360 (pronounced chi-hoo) go back as far back as the nineties: it all started with the launch in 1998 of the founder of Qihoo, Zhou Honum, the service 3721.com, similar in concept to AOL Keywords: browser, the user got on a particular site.  In 2003, during the heyday of Internet search, the company was bought by the Chinese division of Yahoo for $ 120 million, and Zhou himself became its CEO.  In 2005, Yahoo, however, sold its business in China to Alibaba, after which Zhou Honume decided to reopen his own business. <br><br>  Over the next seven years, Qihoo received more than $ 25 million in private financing from more than ten investors, and also attracted nearly half a billion dollars during the bond issue in December 2013.  In 2011, we carried out an IPO by entering the New York Stock Exchange.  In 2015, it was decided to transfer the company back to the private ownership of the founders. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/100/431/c64/100431c64b2a5f6818927ecbdf4f885f.jpg"></div><br>  Do not forget about the mobile application store - being the second search engine after Baidu in mainland China, our company in 2012 made the logical decision to open its own app store.  Despite the fact that while it is aimed mainly at the Chinese user, the site is not inferior in traffic to the shops from such monsters as Xiaomi and Huawei. <br><br>  Plans for expansion as never before, including the Russian market.  The next milestone in this process was the release of a new version of the free package Qihoo 360 Total Security, fully localized for Russian users, and with the support of three anti-virus engines: Avira Antivir, BitDefender, and QVM II. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3693da">Desktop version</font> </h2><br>  Let's start with our newest solution for Windows users, Qihoo 360 Total Security, designed to comprehensively protect the average user‚Äôs machine.  The package, weighing just over 40 MB (by the way, this size is rare today; most competitors have already exceeded one hundred megabytes), includes a lot of tools for maximum protection: AV scanner, proactive protection system and sandbox ( sandbox), toolkits for cleaning the system from temporary files and other miscellaneous things like application caches, simple autoload setup and tasks in the scheduler, and so on. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cce/446/6ee/cce4466ee52e62c8d8bba3c5ba8f1181.png"></div><br>  The ‚Äúmain‚Äù element in the whole package is, of course, the scanner itself;  One of its key features is the ability to work with several anti-virus engines at once.  In the standard delivery, 360 Total Security works with its native QVMII AI engine, as well as the cloud services of the 360 ‚Äã‚ÄãCloud scan, which is functionally similar to VirusTotal;  at the same time, there is a possibility, literally in one click, to install Avira AntiVir and BitDefender engines, which will allow the engine to use four sets of signatures at once, and, thus, more reliably detect malware. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ccb/67a/1d8/ccb67a1d85184c853bd5564db40e391f.png"></div><br>  Disk check can be run in three different versions - fast, complete, and selective;  as the name of the mode suggests, fast checks only system directories and vital services, full - all available disks, and selective checks pre-defined directories or drives.  Of course, in case of detection of suspicious files, they can be sent for analysis, and in case of deliberately false triggering, add the file to the white list. <br><br>  In addition, 360 Total Security is also able to do routine operations like optimizing the startup list (in manual and automatic mode), stripping temporary files, various caches and remnants of extensions removed from browsers, and even deleting old copies of system restore copies and backup copies of drivers. and system update installers. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f3c/633/24f/f3c63324ff138742c23cbf9a102f336b.png"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1e4/625/568/1e46255686e8eadcb9b27db75f4ca6e3.png"></div><br><br>  So, judge for yourself: a very decent interface, which you can use without any extra effort, a neat identity and iconography;  It should be noted separately for a better quality than the overwhelming majority of Chinese vendors, the translation into Russian didn‚Äôt do, of course, without flaws, like a couple of inscriptions that didn‚Äôt fit in their place, but these shortcomings will definitely be eliminated.  Yes, and it's difficult to find fault with the functionality - Qihoo 360 Total Security is able to do everything that today is the de facto standard for large and smart anti-virus packages.  A set of integrated services and utilities for maintenance will be a pleasant surprise for many users - in particular, the cleaning utility, which in good faith and thoroughness is not inferior to the same CCLeaner. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4f0/68e/c46/4f068ec464ed44b0bc34474086939f14.png"></div><br>  The other day we released a new version of 360 Total Security - 8.6.  This time, the users themselves have chosen one of the new functions by voting in social networks. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe always strive to make our applications more accessible to all.  By allowing users to select features for the new version, we involve them in the development process.  This is useful for both users and our products, ‚Äùsaid Zhou HongYi, chairman and CEO of Qihoo 360. <br><br>  In a survey about what function users want to see in the new version of the program, the most of the subscribers voted for cleaning the registry.  This tool allows you to easily and conveniently remove unnecessary entries from the registry and solve other problems. <br><br>  Version 8.6 also added new Google Chrome extensions to analyze downloaded files, secure online purchases and protect against phishing.  This module will allow you to determine in real time the reliability of visited sites and notify you of suspicious and malicious sites that endanger the security system. <br><br>  In addition, the new version 360 Total Security in high resolution is the first version optimized for HPD and Retina monitors. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d31/d4d/c89/d31d4dc89da34c27aa75096b4d607eea.jpg"></div><br>  The challenge for our company is not easy - winning the sympathies of users of the CIS and Eastern Europe - regions whose competition in the market is sharper than ever, and where the winner is destined to become a company that can combine simplicity and power, ease of use and high reliability in its products. .  It seems to us that 360 Total Security has every chance to succeed. <br><br>  It should not be forgotten that <a href="https://www.360totalsecurity.com/ru/%3Futm_campaign%3D360ts%26utm_content%3Dpost5%26utm_medium%3Dlink%26utm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_term%3Dpost5">360 Total Security is</a> completely free and devoid of advertising.  That is why it is worth trying it in every way :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300848/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300848/</a></p>
