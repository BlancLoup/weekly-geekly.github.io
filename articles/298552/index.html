      MTS and MegaFon have applied for everything, and VimpelCom for 69 regional lots.  This company does not participate in the auctions in the Vologda and Magadan regions, the Jewish, Nenets, Chukotka and Yamalo-Nenets autonomous districts, the Trans-Baikal Territory, the republics of Buryatia, Komi, Mari-El, Tuva and Khakassia. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  "Daughter" "T2 RTK Holding" (TM <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tele2_%25D0%25A0%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">Tele2</a> ) "T2 Mobile" claims for lots in St. Petersburg, Bryansk, Kirov, Kursk, Lipetsk, Novosibirsk and Orenburg regions - only seven. <br><br>  In ‚ÄúT2 RTK Holding‚Äù they stated that they applied for only those lots in which they consider receiving frequencies as ‚Äúthe most effective investment of funds and a new opportunity for development‚Äù. <br><br>  ‚ÄúUsually, companies assume that there are not many frequencies.  Perhaps the operator sets the task of using the entire resource that he got after joining <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC">Rostelecom‚Äôs</a> mobile assets, actively building networks and not spending money on new frequencies, ‚Äùsuggests Konstantin Ankilov, managing partner of <a href="http://tmt-consulting.ru/">TMT Consulting</a> . <br><br>  Partner of <a href="http://www.acm-consulting.com/">ACM Consulting,</a> Anton Pogrebinsky, believes that in all regions for which T2 RTK Holding has submitted an application, he has strong positions.  In turn, VimpelCom does not participate in tenders in regions where it has weaker positions.  ‚ÄúPerhaps VimpelCom wants to shift the focus also to the regions where it has a large market share,‚Äù the expert believes. <br><br>  Another version - the part of the regions where VimpelCom did not participate, falls under the agreement with MTS.  In mid-December, the companies announced that they intend to share frequencies in 20 regions.  There is an intersection, but only one - the Vologda region. <br><br>  The range of 2600 MHz is not designed to build LTE networks from scratch - the range of base stations is small and building a separate network at these frequencies would be too expensive, <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2016/02/05/627024-nazvani">said</a> Michael Alekseev, managing partner of AC &amp; M-Consulting, <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2016/02/05/627024-nazvani">to</a> Vedomosti.  According to him, both federal and regional operators need frequencies in the 2600 MHz band where they need to increase network capacity or mobile access speed. <br><br>  The auction for frequencies in the 2600 MHz band is the second in the history of the Russian telecommunications industry. <br><br>  During the first auction in the history of Russia, at which frequencies in the 1800 MHz range were played in ten lots, their total initial cost increased six times - from 1.033 billion rubles to 6.280 billion rubles.  The first auction lasted five days without a break. <br><br>  In comparison with the previous one, in the upcoming auction they increased the step size from 1% to 5%.  As market participants expect, this will allow playing the resource faster.  Another significant difference: the winners of the 27 lots of the second auction, in addition to the amount determined during the auction, will have to pay monetary compensation for refusing to use the radio frequency spectrum to companies that have previously provided MMDS (wireless TV) services with this resource . <br><br>  The amount of compensation can be calculated only by the results of the auction: the final value of the lot should be used as one of the values ‚Äã‚Äãin the calculation formula. <br><br>  In the upcoming auction for the most expensive regional lots - frequencies in St. Petersburg (134.3 million rubles), the Republic of Tatarstan (100 million rubles) and the Sverdlovsk region (122.9 million rubles) - there were four applicants. <br><br>  The only exception is the Krasnoyarsk Territory (126.2 million rubles), where the ‚Äúbig three‚Äù submitted applications.  The largest number of applications - from five applicants - came to the lot in Chechnya (the initial cost was 24.5 million rubles), <a href="http://kommersant.ru/doc/2911783">reports</a> Kommersant. <br><br>  <b>Update:</b> <br><br>  Mobile TeleSystems PJSC (MTS) won the auction for the federal LTE frequency band in the range of 2595-2620 MHz, a source familiar with the results of the auction told Interfax.  The initial cost of the frequencies was 2.94 billion rubles, MTS won after seven steps, offering 3.97 billion rubles, the source <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/newsline/technology/news/2016/02/09/628095-mts-lte-chastot">said</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298552/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298552/</a></p>
