  <section class="page js-page"><h1>ICQuery is a fictional program that communicates with the user and performs tasks described in the natural language of communication.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãand development environments are developing continuously, offering the modern developer more and more goodies.  I am sure that that day is not far off, and the time will come when computers will learn to understand live speech and convert it into machine code.  I decided to imagine how this might look like in reality, perhaps even contribute a little to this.  By the way, the title of this article is written in ICQuery as I imagine it, and is the source code of the analogue of its main function. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote><h3>  The first day. </h3>  <b>Proger</b> : Hi! <br>  <b>ICQuery</b> : Good day!  How can I help? <br>  <b>Proger</b> : you need to write a program ... <br>  <b>ICQuery</b> : I will help with pleasure!  Writing programs is my main and main purpose.  What do you call the finished product? <br>  <b>Proger</b> : HelloWorld <br>  <b>ICQuery</b> : What functionality does HelloWorld have? <br>  <b>Proger</b> : Displays the text "Hello World" <br>  <b>ICQuery</b> : Where does it lead? <br>  <b>Proger</b> : at the terminal <br>  <b>ICQuery</b> : What does the terminal mean in the context of the program? <br>  <b>Proger</b> : Standard Output Device <br>  <b>ICQuery</b> : Accepted.  HelloWorld is a program that outputs a "Hello World" character sequence to a terminal, which is a standard output device.  All right <br>  <b>Proger</b> : 0_o fig.  Is that all you had to enter to create the program Hello World? <br>  <b>ICQuery</b> : Yes.  Thank you for your appreciation of my work.  While we were talking, I determined that the programs of this class are traditionally used to create a primary impression of an unknown programming language, as well as to test its capabilities.  I can assure you that I am the quintessence of the development of all these languages, as well as all kinds of machine architectures, including an abacus, sewing machines, mechanical pianos, and analog VMs.  I combine the best features of chat bots, artificial intelligence research and the power of ancient visual development environments.  As a result, I can understand programs written in natural language, no worse than a living person.  Moreover, I can translate the resulting program into any programming language I know, including machine code, assembler, and present it in the form of mathematical formulas or flowcharts.  And this is only a negligible part of my capabilities.  In what form do you want to get the result? <br>  Progger (more and more fucking): Windows binary ... <br>  <b>ICQuery</b> : Accepted.  I am starting work on creating the binary code of the Hello World application for the current version of Windows architecture ... <br>  <sup><i>*** <b>ICQuery</b> generates HelloWorld.exe and passes it to Proger.</i></sup>  <sup><i>The principle of transmission is not important, it is important that Proger, trying to run it in his Windows 100500+, gets the coveted Hello World inscription in the terminal window.</i></sup> <br>  <b>Proger</b> , reverently: it really works, thank you very much. <br>  <b>ICQuery</b> : it was nice to help, if you need something, please contact again. </blockquote><br>  What do you think, is it possible to do this?  In the next article I will try to explain that there is nothing particularly difficult in this concept, especially if you start thinking in ICQuery. <br><br>  PS Since such comments have gone ... <br><blockquote>  The author argues that creating a strong AI is a trivial matter. </blockquote>  Where do I claim that this thing is spit?  The creator of such a language will have to slip through millions of years of evolution in a reasonable time, which will clearly be shorter than his life if he does not abandon his studies and transfer them to other people.  He will have to bring the simplest prokaryotic cell nucleus to the level of development of a kindergarten graduate, and, if lucky, until the end of primary school.  If you are very lucky, his AI can complete the school entirely. <br><br>  What I am really saying is that a strong AI must be written in a language as close as possible to the natural.  And yes, I have absolutely no experience in this area.  There is a good knowledge of Russian language, psychology, experience in writing technical specifications and development experience in several languages ‚Äã‚Äãat the same time.  I think this is a good combination of skills :) </div>
