  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Phone evolution</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="http://progeek.ru/img/evo/0.jpg"><br><br>  From the huge, 35-pound, mounted in auto devices, we came to the small terminals that fit in our pockets.  What once weighed like a brick and cost like a car, now weighs a few dozen grams and everyone can afford it.  It‚Äôs hard to imagine that once these huge engines could only call and the battery capacity was only enough for a few minutes, but now a gadget weighing 100 grams can not only call for a long time, but also has full multimedia capabilities and wireless access The Internet. <br><br>  How did we come to this?  Let's delve into the history of mobile phone development.  The following 14 phones may not necessarily be the first or the best in their time, but it is they who most clearly show us the phases in the development of these in the last 50 years.

      <font color="red">Traffic ~ 1.3 MB.</font> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  1956 Ericsson MTA. </h2><br><img title="Ericsson MTA, 35 pound colossus" src="http://progeek.ru/img/evo/1.jpg"><br>  And began the "mobility" with bulky devices, the representative of which is a mobile phone MTA, the Swedish company Ericsson.  Although the gadget is not portable, it is still mobile.  8) This device weighed about 40 kilograms, and with an additional battery it weighed even more, so it was mounted in a car.  A total of two copies were produced, which served as a means of communication exclusively for Swedish doctors and lawyers in two different cities. <br><br><h2>  1973-1983 Motorola DynaTAC 8000X </h2><br><img title="Motorola DynaTAC 8000X" src="http://progeek.ru/img/evo/2.jpg"><br>  Although the American company Motorola announced a prototype of the world's first portable mobile phone, the DynaTAC 8000X, in 1973, it took ten years for the phone to enter the market.  During these ten years, the company has made the phone more compact, built the necessary infrastructure - radio towers throughout the country.  DynaTAC weighed about 800 grams, 25 centimeters high, a huge battery lasted for 60 minutes and as a typical mobile phone, had a memory of 11 numbers, an LED screen and a keyboard. <br><br>  After graduation in 1983, DynaTAC immediately became a cultural icon as a symbol of prosperity, because the phone cost $ 3995, which in terms of the current rate of inflation is $ 8657. <br>  So it was with DynaTAC 8000x that the evolution of portable mobile devices began. <br><br><h2>  1984 Nokia Mobira Talkman </h2><br><img title="Nokia Mobira Talkman" src="http://progeek.ru/img/evo/3.jpg"><br>  The handheld Motorola DynaTAC 8000X produced an amazing breakthrough, however it was clear that its size led to a small unit operating time, while larger portable devices, such as Mobira Talkman, equipped with more capacious batteries, could provide many hours of continuous communication. <br><br><h2>  1989 Motorola MicroTAC </h2><br><img title="Motorola MicroTAC" src="http://progeek.ru/img/evo/4.jpg"><br>  After the success of the DynaTAC 8000X, in 1989, Motorola produced a lighter and smaller MicroTAC model.  MicroTAC had a new folding form factor that made it even more compact.  Engineers of the company placed part of the telephone hardware in the lower (hinged) part.  However, with the exception of the overall revolution, the new MicroTAC did not receive any new technical capabilities, but the clamshell form factor became the benchmark of a mobile phone. <br><br><h2>  1994 Motorola 2900 Bag Phone </h2><br><img title="Motorola 2900 Bag Phone" src="http://progeek.ru/img/evo/5.jpg"><br>  We all watched American films of the end of the last century.  When the machines installed phones with a numeric keypad and a small screen.  The first such phone was the iconic Motorola 2900 Bag Phone, released in 1994.  The bag contained a transceiver and a battery, the owners could carry the bag on their shoulders, but many preferred to leave the phone in the car.  Despite having more portable phones, the Motorola 2900 remained very popular until the end of the 90s, due to its rather long usage time.  Thanks to a rather capacitive battery, the phone could transmit a signal with more power, which allowed the phone to be used much further than radio towers, of which there were very few. <br><br><h2>  1996 Motorola StarTAC </h2><br><img title="Motorola StarTAC" src="http://progeek.ru/img/evo/6.jpg"><br>  Motorola continues its story with the StarTAC product, produced in 1996.  StarTAC has become the lightest and most compact phone of its time.  The phone weighed 85 grams and had an even more compact full clamshell form factor, unlike MicroTAC.  The era of folding beds began with this model. <br><br><h2>  1997 Nokia 9000i </h2><br><img title="Nokia 9000i" src="http://progeek.ru/img/evo/7.jpg"><br>  Although the Nokia 9000i, produced in '97, was not the first smartphone in history (it was IBM Simon), it was the beginning of the era of modern smartphones.  The 9000i really was a pocket computer and a mobile phone in one bottle, with an Intel 386 processor with a frequency of 24 MHz, 8 MB of RAM.  The main feature of this phone was its unusual form factor with a full qwerty keyboard, the ability to send and receive fax, text messages and e-mail. <br><br><h2>  1998 Nokia 8810 </h2><br><img title="Nokia 8810" src="http://progeek.ru/img/evo/8.jpg"><br>  1998, the announcement of the Nokia 8810, which stood out because it did not stick with an external antenna.  Nokia engineers were able to hide the antenna in the body of the device.  As a result, the 8800 has truly become the first all-in-one PC and the benchmark of Nokia phones even to this day.  Nowadays, phones with protruding antennas are rarely found. <br><br><h2>  1999 Nokia 7110 </h2><br><img title="Nokia 7110" src="http://progeek.ru/img/evo/9.jpg"><br>  Not long ago, WAP (Wireless Application Protocol) was very popular.  The mobile phone industry has developed the WAP protocol to make the web available on simple devices with limited computing power.  The Finnish company Nokia, became the first manufacturer to introduce this protocol into the phone.  So, in the year 99, the Nokia 7110 appeared. <br>  In our era of high-performance mobile devices with full-featured browsers and large screens, WAP has quickly become a subsistence of the past. <br><br><h2>  2002 BlackBerry 5810 </h2><br><img title="BlackBerry 5810" src="http://progeek.ru/img/evo/10.jpg"><br>  BlackBerry began its business with pager production, but in 2002 they entered the smartphone market with their first product, the BlackBerry 5810. Thanks to the qwerty keyboard, mobile email and SMS functionality, BlackBerry phones have become an indispensable tool for businessmen and other professionals. <br><br><h2>  2002 Sanyo SCP-5300 </h2><br><img title="Sanyo SCP-5300" src="http://progeek.ru/img/evo/11.jpg"><br>  In Japan, they often talked about the combination of a camera and a phone, but it seemed to everyone that this was incompatible and inconvenient.  In the same 2002, the company Sanyo released the first phone in the world with an integrated camera and the world, as if, went crazy with this device.  Today, cameras have become an integral part of mobile phones, and nowadays one rarely finds a phone without a camera.  Previously, phones with an integrated camera were called camera phones (remember the Sony-ericsson k750), but now, since almost every phone has a camera, this name has become irrelevant. <br><br><h2>  2002 T-Mobile Sidekick </h2><br><img title="T-Mobile Sidekick" src="http://progeek.ru/img/evo/12.jpg"><br>  Probably, everyone already knows that 2002 was a revolutionary and turning point in the mobile world.  During the year several cult apparatuses were manufactured, including the T-Mobile Sidekick / Danger Hiptop.  Everyone probably remembers GameBoy advanced, Sidekick had just such a form factor and immediately conquered the youth and those who often communicated via sms, because the gadget had a qwert-keyboard, and the unusual form of the device was so convenient that you could write SMS with a huge by speed. <br><br><h2>  2004 Motorola RAZR </h2><br><img title="Motorola RAZR" src="http://progeek.ru/img/evo/13.jpg"><br>  2004, again, Motorola with a phone of all time RAZR.  Remember only the advertising company of this model, people stood in lines for the coveted ultra-thin and stylish phone.  The phone had huge multimedia capabilities, a large screen and a flat keyboard.  It is worth noting that this device is still popular in some countries. <br><br><h2>  2007 - ... Apple Iphone </h2><br><img title="Apple iphone" src="http://progeek.ru/img/evo/14.jpg"><br>  2007, Apple Iphone.  Today is the last stage of development of mobile phones, smartphones and PDAs.  I will not write anything, because  This phase passes by you and you all observe its dynamics yourself. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/72788/">https://habr.com/ru/post/72788/</a></p>
