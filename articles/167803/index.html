  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The most notable problems of cloud providers for 2012</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  2012 has just ended.  And it ended with very controversial results for Cloud Technologies.  Many have lost money, time and nerves in different situations caused by providers.  And the providers, in turn, spoiled their reputation. <br><br>  In my opinion, it is too early to talk about full confidence in Cloud technologies and high stability of such services.  In other matters, this is a topic for discussion, there can be no single opinion here. <br>  I suggest you look at the 10 largest failures and problems of cloud providers for 2012 and draw conclusions. <br>  In 2012, problems and failures were haunted by cloud providers with enviable persistence, giving the impression that failure was not an event that went beyond the limits of normality, but quite the opposite, an everyday occurrence. <br><br>  This situation contributed to negative sentiment.  Probably, you should not trust your core assets to public cloud providers yet.  Accordingly, hybrid and private clouds became more widespread and developed.  Nevertheless, let's look at the direct participants in this drama:

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>10. Tumblr</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c34/92b/a3d/c3492ba3d5960203acaceb4c89055e33.jpg"><br><br>  The blogging platform did not function for several hours on December 3, due to the attack of the anti-blogging group 'GNAA'.  According to some reports, more than 8,600 users suffered.  Tumblr himself did not explain the reasons for the problems, however, he informed the users that their personal information remained safe and secure and did not fall into third hands. <br><br>  <b>9. GoDaddy</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/532/01c/ab6/53201cab6915747662a6509d6cd202b7.png"><br><br>  September 10 at 6 o'clock GoDaddy became unavailable.  This company has a huge number of clients, both large companies and small sites.  No information about who and how much lost there.  The company claimed that the problems were caused by a series of internal network errors, and not by an anonymous group of hackers, as expected.  A month later, GoDaddy announced that they were shutting down the provision of cloud hosting and switch to the provision of other services. <br><br>  <b>8. Salesforce.com</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b77/148/84c/b7714884cbdeb76a422b8fef3e91e6e4.jpg"><br><br>  Some of the Salesforce.com services did not work on July 10 for reasons related to the failure of new equipment in West Coast data centers.  For some customers, services were not available until 2 days! <br>  Earlier, on June 28, an error in the software caused problems with data warehouses, which also served as a negative factor. <br><br>  <b>7. Dropbox</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/19f/0a9/873/19f0a9873603a4f0c49c7737a8309c78.png"><br><br>  In October, the 26th, the problems lasted for several hours.  The error message on the site looked like this: ‚ÄúError: Something went wrong.  Don't worry, your files are still safe. ‚Äù <br>  Interestingly, on the same day, Google App Engine had problems, as well as Tumblr.  All this gave rise to the opinion that the problems with Internet access were global, but no one knows the real reasons and they have not been established. <br><br>  <b>6. Google Talk</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/111/bbc/e47/111bbce47a514cf44aec5c81fbc8a55f.png"><br><br>  The popular and sought-after instant messaging service did not work for almost 5 hours on July 27. <br>  The news feed of the service was constantly updated and kept users abreast of what was happening, later Google asked for forgiveness, immediately after the work of the service was restored.  The apology said: ‚ÄúThe main priority for Google is the availability of services and we are working to continuously improve stability.‚Äù <br><br>  <b>5. Google App Engine</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3fb/50c/25e/3fb50c25ebac55ffef153956fec72a34.jpeg"><br><br>  All in the same October, the 26th, Google App Engine, a platform for hosting and developing applications, was unavailable for almost 4 hours.  As a result, approximately 50% of requests to the server did not reach the final goal.  Later, the company reported that the data was not lost and the normal functioning of the service was restored.  Measures were also taken: ‚ÄúWe have increased traffic throughput in order to avoid similar situations in the future.‚Äù <br><br>  <b>4. Microsoft Office 365</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/26a/8fb/f71/26a8fbf71931c7b1dd319a07cf9a888e.jpg"><br><br>  In November, 2 times, Microsoft Office 365 users for some time were unable to use mail services. <br>  ‚ÄúWe all understand here what responsibility we bear before our users and realize how many problems were created for our clients' business.  This is unacceptable, ‚Äùsaid Rajesh Jha, vice president of the Microsoft Office division in a blog post. <br>  Customers in the Americas could not use the service for about 8 hours, November 8.  November 15, the situation repeated, this time the problems lasted for 5 hours. <br><br>  <b>3. Microsoft Windows Azure</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/021/3b8/229/0213b82297e2827f20580344fe9b98f5.jpg"><br><br>  Because of problems with the configuration of the equipment and as a result of traffic loss in one of the regions of Eastern Europe, Microsoft Windows Azure was unavailable for 2.5 hours.  It happened on July 26th.  The consequences of such an incident are difficult to predict and evaluate. <br><br>  <b>2. Microsoft Windows Azure.</b>  <b>Again.</b> <br><br>  February 28-29, Microsoft Windows Azure suffered globally and seriously, having stopped providing services for more than a day.  The cause was a problem, later called a ‚Äúleap year bug‚Äù.  Time was considered incorrect for a leap year, thereby making the certificates used for authentication invalid.  Some users were outraged and argued that Microsoft could not adequately respond to the problem.  ‚ÄúI noticed that there are no approximate deadlines for eliminating the problem.  What is the reason for this behavior? ‚Äù- noted one of the users. <br><br>  <b>1. Amazon Web Services.</b>  <b>Again and again.</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/13f/5b1/1e1/13f5b11e1effbda9fa6e0ebb61f84b4c.png"><br>  Amazon suffered twice in 2012.  In 2011 it happened 1 time.  On June 14, 2012, problems with services in Virginia stopped work for more than 6 hours, thereby affecting customer data. <br>  On October 22, Amazon fell in Northern Virginia, with the result that sites that hosted in this region were inaccessible.  Even the approximate number of those can not be assumed.  These problems have shown that even the leading provider of cloud technologies is not able to provide one hundred percent availability of its services. <br><br>  So, problems, problems, problems.  The promises of providers about HA in reality turn out to be just promises.  At least for now.  So it‚Äôs still too early to talk about complete trust, security and reliability of data in the cloud. <br><br>  At the same time, you can at least try to protect yourself from this kind of problems.  To do this, use your own Fault Tolerance and Disaster Recovery solutions.  Also, do not be stingy and use Multi-Zone Deployment in your applications.  Quality services are the most important thing in our work.  And you need as little as possible to depend on someone. <br>  Let's see what will happen in 2013. Thank you and good luck to us all. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/167803/">https://habr.com/ru/post/167803/</a></p>
