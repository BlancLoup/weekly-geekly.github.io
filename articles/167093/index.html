They built, developed a new one and flew it right there.  At the age of 5, it became a discovery for me that someone in this world might not fly.  For my 26 years, I managed to try almost everything on what you can fly.  I want to share my experience and talk about the possibilities available. <br>  To start flying you have such options: <br><br>  1. Parsers (in this article) <br><ul><li>  Paraglider </li><li>  Hang glider </li><li>  Glider </li></ul><br>  2.

      The principle of soaring flight is based on the existence of ascending air currents.  Like the wind, just straight up.  The pilot's task is to find such a flow of air and stay in it for some time to gain altitude, and then fly to the next flow.  And so in the cycle. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a20/f60/bf1/a20f60bf14c8217d2ac325aab6d28507.jpg"><br><br>  The main advantage of pars is flying without fuel.  Only starting energy is needed to set the initial height.  However, this imposes limitations.  For take-off, you need somewhere to take the initial energy.  You can take off or from the mountain, or with the help of a winch, or after another, motor, aircraft. <br><br>  One of the main characteristics of any aircraft is quality.  And for parners, this is the most important characteristic.  This value determines how many kilometers you can fly having decreased by 1 km.  Usually this value is from 3 to 60. That is  being at an altitude of 1000 meters you can fly up to 60km in a straight line.  (in absolutely perfect conditions and at a certain speed) <br><br><h4>  Stereotypes about soaring flights </h4><br><ul><li>  <b>Fly is dangerous.</b> <br>  It is dangerous to cross the road in the wrong place because  you can be hit by a car.  And in the air, everything depends on you. </li><li>  <b>In the air, you can encounter another aircraft or a bird.</b> <br>  This possibility exists, but its probability is so small that cases of such collisions can be counted on fingers.  One of the most famous is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DoZ2H3159Pmc">alive, safe, an eagle</a> .  The probability of a collision with another aircraft depends on the number of these devices around you. </li><li>  <b>It is very difficult to take off and land.</b> <br>  Yes, this is the most difficult part of the flight, but not more difficult than driving an unregulated intersection by car.  However, it all depends on your chosen aircraft.  For paragliders and hang gliders this is much more complicated than for a glider. </li><li>  <b>It takes a very long time to learn how to start flying by yourself.</b> <br>  It is necessary to study, but not more than on automobile courses.  Even less because  There are no traffic policemen and road signs in the air.  But to fly away from the place of take-off somewhere, you already need to learn much more. </li><li>  <b>No flights without wind</b> <br>  The wind is practically unrelated to the ability to fly.  The flight is due to vertical air flow. </li><li>  <b>Without a motor you cannot fly long and far</b> <br>  On a plain in normal weather, you can fly all daylight hours.  In the mountains, you can fly forever.  there are streams of flow around the mountains.  In my first summer year, in Kiev, on a glider, I once flew 6 hours a day without a break.  It could have been longer, but the strength was gone. </li><li>  <b>If something breaks in the air and there is no chance of escape</b> . <br>  The design is so simple that there is almost nothing to break in it under normal loads.  Electrical systems are auxiliary and their failure is not critical for flight.  No device is vital.  You can take off and land without any instruments at all.  In addition, there is always a parachute for unforeseen situations. </li><li>  <b>This is really extreme</b> <br>  It depends on what is meant by extreme.  All aviation is based on flight safety and extreme sports minimization.  If you learned to take off and immediately flew along the route, then this is not extreme, but stupidity.  Listen to experienced pilots, read the description of the flight accidents of other pilots and do not violate the laws of aerodynamics, and you will fly safely. </li><li>  <b>It is very expensive</b> <br>  In reality, it costs from 50u.e. / month.  Your aircraft does not always need to buy.  Renting is often more profitable. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Paraglider </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/af9/5fe/fb7/af95fefb73a7aa46d5390909ba13f285.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Data </h5><br><ul><li>  Flight speed from 20 to 70 km / h. </li><li>  Design only from fabric.  His progenitor was a parachute. </li><li>  The weight of the pilot is from 40 to 130 kg. </li><li>  The weight of the paraglider with the equipment is about 15kg. </li><li>  World record for the distance (downwind) <a href="http://www.fai.org/fai-record-file/%3FrecordId%3D15231">502km</a> . </li><li>  Record on the triangular route with the return to the start place - <a href="http://www.fai.org/fai-record-file/%3FrecordId%3D15947">118 km</a> . </li></ul><br><h5>  pros </h5><br><ul><li>  The feeling of free flight when the wind is right in the face. </li><li>  Very compact.  It fits in a large backpack with which you can even drive in public transport. </li><li>  There is no red tape with documents and medical records. </li><li>  Very spectacular and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DHDBVzmDOMGA">impressionable</a> . </li><li>  You can fly without help.  Took and flew.  I landed somewhere, packed everything up in a backpack, and drove the bus home. </li><li>  It‚Äôs hard to break.  You can break. </li><li>  Landing outside the airfield is not a problem.  You can sit anywhere. </li></ul><br><h5>  Minuses </h5><br><ul><li>  Takeoff / landing from the feet.  Risk of injury. </li><li>  Wing without pipes.  This means that theoretically it can <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DyeZr2zMMJQ8">collapse in the air</a> .  However, it is possible to reveal it =) </li><li>  Very small flight speed.  Flying against the wind is actually not realistic (except for flights in the mountains). </li><li>  Take off only from the mountain or by towing.  Take off on their own from the plain is impossible. </li><li>  No cab.  The higher you fly, the colder it is. </li></ul><br><h5>  Budget </h5><br><ul><li>  Ride in tandem.  It costs about $ 50. </li><li>  Training takes place on small slides on club technology from $ 50 per month. </li><li> You can buy yourself second-hand for $ 500-1000. </li><li>  A sports paraglider costs about $ 2500. </li></ul><br><br><h5>  Ordinary paragliding in the Crimea </h5><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/gLknrgHouZ4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255&amp;usg=ALkJrhgVmlmQLeuGyjx5vMag6SKr1OVjIQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">More photos of paragliders</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><h5>  On the ground, before takeoff </h5><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/708/2a4/391/7082a4391b9231e4a7825db61d7aae08.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Transportation in bag </h5><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e70/59c/f5f/e7059cf5fcf85a80c5761e7b57454888.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Flying together (tandem) </h5><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/68a/2f0/d06/68a2f0d06d08c69e700998131a6d5f42.jpg"><br></div></div><br><br><h4>  Hang glider </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/31c/562/488/31c562488cf451ec29e94e63a9395270.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Data </h5><br><ul><li>  Flight speed from 30 to 120 km / h. </li><li>  Triangular shape, from metal pipes and fabrics. </li><li>  It is long put from 2 meters (usually put in a 6 meter package).

To fly from point A to B is difficult.  There is always the risk of landing somewhere in the middle.  This is a hobby that allows you to feel the taste of free flight and look at the earth from a height.  Soaring flights can not get bored - this is a non-standard task every time. <br>  Want to fly safely, high and with comfort - choose a glider. <br>  Want extreme and wind in the face - a hang glider or paraglider. <br>  In any case, you can try everything. <br><br><h5>  Addition to the conclusions after the comments. </h5><br>  Safe flight - is following the rules that are written in the books on the organization of flights and their own responsibility for their actions.  If you learn to fly without reading books, without learning the principles of aerodynamics and meteorology, then you will fly at random.  And someday you will be unlucky.  You can fly safely on any aircraft, if you follow the instructions for organizing the flight and pre-flight training.  Paragliding is the easiest way to break these rules.  there is an illusory simplicity of control and the principles of flight organization are most often violated.  On gliders you will not be allowed to start flying by yourself until you have a guaranteed minimum of knowledge, which will be supported by control flights with an instructor. <br><br>  <b>Paragliding and hang-gliding</b> , like a weekend hobby, is quite safe and budget for the middle class.  However, injuries occur during the learning phase.  As a sport - this is extreme sports.  This is very dangerous, and only for those who are ready for it. <br><br>  <b>Gliding</b> is <u>not an</u> extreme sport.  Injury - football while waiting for the weather. <br>  Flight accidents - is, was, and will be like not calculated situations in flight.  But it is still comparable with the probability of a car accident. <br><br>  But the daily 12 hour sitting at the computer is guaranteed to lead to irreversible injuries of the cardiovascular system.  They are not visible for the time being, and then, as a rule, ‚Äúlate to drink Borjomi‚Äù. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">My personal, very subjective opinion</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  I know a lot of people who were flying on hang-gliders and paragliders, but switched to a glider.  And I don‚Äôt know anyone who would switch from gliders to hang gliders or paragliders.  In the CIS, there is a unique situation where there are many experienced instructors and normal equipment, and you can fly on a glider terribly cheap.
