But to write, you need to have <a href="http://webhostingw.com/support-satisfaction-methodology/">analytical data</a> <a href="http://webhostingw.com/uptime-analytics-methodology/">at hand</a> .  This is where Google Docs help is required if the file is supposedly less than 400,000 lines. <br><br>  For several months of working with tables, Google had to analyze many times using formulas of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/144880/">various kinds of data</a> .  As expected - what could be solved in MS Excel can be implemented in Google spreadsheets.  But numerous attempts to solve problems with the help of a favorite search engine led only to new questions and almost to zero answers. <br>  Therefore, it was decided to make life easier for others and <a href="http://americanohost.ru/">glorify themselves</a> . <br><h2>  Briefly about the main thing </h2><br>  In order for Excel or spreadsheet (Google table) to understand that what is written is a formula, you need to put an "=" sign in the formula bar (Figure 1). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/36e/9b8/567/36e9b85673afada3e308573e438bce43.jpg" alt="ok"><br>  <strong><em>Picture 1</em></strong> <br>  Next, we begin to write the formula from the keyboard or select the cells with which we are going to work with the mouse. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To determine the cell can be used 2 types of symbols: <br><ul><li>  alphanumeric (LETTER = COLUMN; DIGIT = LINE) such as "A1". </li><li>  style R1C1, in the system R1C1 and the rows and columns are denoted by numbers. </li></ul><br>  Cell address ‚ÄúB3‚Äù in such a system will look like R3C2 (R = row = row, C = column = column).  For scripts, for example, both styles are used. <br>  Where we write "= formula", for example, = SUM (A1: A10) and our value will be displayed. <br>  The general principle of operation of RC formulas is shown in Figure 2.

To preserve the aesthetic appearance of the formulas, the characters [0] are written in them, which you may not have to write: R [0] C [1] = RC [1]. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ae1/da6/061/ae1da6061a67adb9602682676112b1a3.jpg" alt="ok"><br>  <strong><em>Figure 3</em></strong> <br>  The difference between Figure 2 and Figure 3 is that Figure 3 is a universal formulation that is not tied to rows and columns (look at the values ‚Äã‚Äãof rows and columns), which cannot be said about Figure 2. But the RC style in the spreadsheet is mainly used for writing javascript scripts. <br><h2>  Link types (addressing types) </h2><br>  For accessing cells, links are used that come in 3 types: <br><ul><li>  Relative references (example, A1); </li><li>  Absolute links (example, $ A $ 1); </li><li>  Mixed links (for example, $ A1 or A $ 1, they are half relative, half absolute). </li></ul><br>  The $ sign here indicates the type of link.  Differences between different types of links can be seen by pulling the autocomplete marker of the active cell or range of cells containing a formula with links. <br><br><h3>  Relative links </h3><br>  The relative link ‚Äúremembers‚Äù at what distance (in rows and columns) you clicked RELATIVE to the position of the cell where you put ‚Äú=‚Äù (offset in rows and columns).  Then pull down the autocomplete marker, and this formula will be copied to all the cells through which we stretched. <br><br><h3>  Absolute links </h3><br>  As mentioned above, if you pull the formula containing relative links for the auto-complete marker, the table will recalculate their addresses.  If the formula contains absolute links, their address will remain unchanged.  Simply put - an absolute link always point to the same cell. <br>  To make the relative reference absolute, it is enough to put the ‚Äú$‚Äù sign in front of the letter of the column and the address of the line, for example, $ A $ 1.  A quicker way is to select a relative link and press the ‚ÄúF4‚Äù key once, while the spreadsheet itself will put down the ‚Äú$‚Äù sign.  If you press "F4" a second time, the link will become mixed type A $ 1, if the third time is $ A1, if it is the fourth time, the link will become relative again.  And so in a circle. <br><br><h3>  Mixed links </h3><br>  Mixed links are half absolute and half relative.  The dollar sign in them is either before the letter of the column or before the row number.  This is the most difficult to understand link type.  For example, the cell contains the formula ‚Äú= A $ 1‚Äù.  Reference A $ 1 is relative in column A and absolute in line 1. If we pull this formula up or down for the auto-fill marker, then the links in all copied formulas will point to cell A1, that is, they will behave as absolute.  However, if we pull right or left, the links behave as relative, that is, the spreadsheet will begin to recalculate its address.  Thus, formulas created by auto-completion will use the same line number ($ 1), but the literal value of the column will change (A, B, C ...). <br><br>  Let's look at an example of summing up cells with multiplication by a certain coefficient. <br><br>  This example assumes the presence of a coefficient value in each calculated cell (cells D8, D9, D10 ... E8, F8 ...).  (Figure 4). <br>  The red arrows indicate the direction of stretching with a marker filling the formula that is in cells C2.  In the formula, notice the change in cell D8.  When stretching downwards, only the number symbolizing the string changes.  When stretching to the right, only the column changes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/419/55a/02d/41955a02d1e46ecf4854c5cd1711bb29.png" alt="ok"><br>  <strong><em>Figure 4</em></strong> <br>  Simplify the example by applying the $ sign (Figure 5). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/419/55a/02d/41955a02d1e46ecf4854c5cd1711bb29.png" alt="ok"><br>  <strong><em>Figure 5</em></strong> <br>  But it is not always necessary to freeze all the columns and rows, sometimes only a row or a column is used. (Figure 6) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/419/55a/02d/41955a02d1e46ecf4854c5cd1711bb29.png" alt="ok"><br>  <strong><em>Figure 6</em></strong> <br>  All formulas can be read on the official site <a href="https://support.google.com/docs/bin/static.py%3Fhl%3Dru%26topic%3D25273%26page%3Dtable.cs%26ctx%3Dtooltip">support.google.com</a> <br>  Important: The data that must be processed in the formulas should not be in different documents, it is possible to do this only with the help of scripts. <br><h2>  Formula Errors </h2><br>  If you write the formula incorrectly, a comment about the syntax error in the formula will inform you about it (Figure 7). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ba8/6ec/930/ba86ec9307b35aaaca773ffe91fd799e.jpg" alt="ok"><br>  <strong><em>Figure 7</em></strong> <br>  Although errors can be not only syntactic, but also, for example, mathematical, such as division by 0 (Figure 7) and others (Figure 7.1, 7.2, 7.3).  To see a note that shows what error occurred, move the cursor over the red triangle in the upper right corner of the error. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6cb/116/3a0/6cb1163a09a2b802d959304356a39732.jpg" alt="ok"><br>  <strong><em>Figure 7.1</em></strong> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cc7/dca/9ae/cc7dca9ae3fdeeba0ef99ff79731e080.jpg" alt="ok"><br>  <strong><em>Figure 7.2</em></strong> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/582/062/be1/582062be1a1188a7f1b6335d9bb06c1f.jpg" alt="ok"><br>  <strong><em>Figure 7.3</em></strong> <br>  For the convenience of perception of the table, all cells with formulas will be painted in purple. <br>  To see the formulas ‚Äúlive‚Äù, press the Ctrl + hot key or select (View)&gt; All formulas from the menu above.

They consist in the fact that instead of the ‚Äúcomma‚Äù, which was used earlier in many formulas, the ‚Äúsemicolon‚Äù ‚Äã‚Äãis already used (the changes occurred more than six months ago). <br>  In order to see what the formula refers to on this page (Figure 9), you need to click the mouse in the formula bar to the right of the Fx inscription (Fx is located below the main menu on the left). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/397/9dc/5da/3979dc5da3c0e932880b9686565bbf77.jpg" alt="ok"><br>  <strong><em>Figure 9</em></strong> <br>  <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> For the correct functioning of the formulas, they must be written in LATIN letters.  Russian (Cyrillic) ‚ÄúA‚Äù or ‚ÄúC‚Äù and Latin ‚ÄúA‚Äù or ‚ÄúC‚Äù for a formula are 2 different letters. <br><h2>  Formulas </h2><br><h3>  Arithmetic formulas. </h3><br>  To paint, of course, the eternal operations of addition, subtraction, etc., no one will, but they will help you understand the basics.  With a few examples, you will understand how they work in this environment.

After filling out the form, the data are presented in a table. And then, use different formulas for working with data, for example , for pasting full name). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f78/db7/9a7/f78db79a7d19dba25a1b19a75d31152e.jpg" alt="ok"><br>  <strong><em>Figure 17</em></strong> <br><h3>  Gluing numeric values. </h3><br><ul><li>  Description: ‚Äústicking‚Äù text values ‚Äã‚Äãwith hands, without using special functions (option B - manual writing a formula, any formula complexity.). </li><li>  Formula type: = cell with number / text 1 &amp; "" &amp; cell with number / text 2 &amp; "" &amp; cell with number / text 3 &amp; "" &amp; cell with number / text 4 ("" is a space, the &amp; sign means gluing, all text values ‚Äã‚Äãare written in quotes ""). </li><li>  The formula itself: = E37 &amp; "" &amp; F37 &amp; "" &amp; G37 &amp; "" &amp; H37. </li></ul><br>  We have the initial data in the range of cells E37: H37, and the result in cell D36 (Figure 18 - glued numbers). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b38/b81/a7b/b38b81a7b72bfd41ba33bc19eca39b28.jpg" alt="ok"><br>  <strong><em>Figure 18</em></strong> <br><h3>  Gluing numeric and textual values. </h3><br><ul><li>  Description: ‚Äúgluing‚Äù text values ‚Äã‚Äãwith hands, without using special functions (option C - mixed type, any formula complexity). </li><li>  Formula type: = "text_1" &amp; cell_1 &amp; "text_2" &amp; cell_2 &amp; "text_3" &amp; cell_3 </li><li>  Important: all text that will be written in ‚Äú‚Äù will be unchanged for the formula. </li><li>  The formula itself: = "Another 1" &amp; E38 &amp; "using" &amp; F38 &amp; "as US" &amp; G38. </li></ul><br>  We have the initial data ‚Äú1 more‚Äù, ‚Äúuses‚Äù, ‚Äúas NAM‚Äù and in the range of cells E38: G38, therefore it is advisable to use this type of formula, and the result in cell D36 (Figure 19). <br>  Glue the text and numeric values. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/419/55a/02d/41955a02d1e46ecf4854c5cd1711bb29.png" alt="ok"><br>  <strong><em>Figure 19</em></strong> <br><h2>  LOGICAL AND OTHER </h2><br><h3>  Transfer data from any sheets of the same file. </h3><br>  We come to the most interesting, in my opinion, functions: LOGICAL AND OTHER. <br>  One of the most necessary formulas: <br><ul><li>  Description: transfer data from any sheets of the same file (for Excel, you can transfer both from a sheet of one book to another sheet of the same book and from a sheet of one book to a sheet of another book). </li><li>  Type of formula: = "Name_List"!  cell_1 </li><li>  The formula itself: = Data!

You can use them, even without knowing it, simply by entering a formula that returns several values. <br>  Array formulas ‚Äúin one cell‚Äù allow you to write formulas using array input, rather than output data.  When entering a formula into the function = ARRAYFORMULA, you can pass arrays or ranges to functions and operators, which, as a rule, use only arguments that do not belong to arrays.  These functions and operators will be applied one by one for each record in the array, and return a new array with all the output data. <br>  If you want to explore the issue in more detail, you should visit <a href="http://support.google.com/drive/bin/answer.py%3Fhl%3Dru%26answer%3D71291">support.google</a> . <br>  In simple words, to work with formulas that return arrays of data, in order to avoid syntactical errors, it is necessary to enclose them in an array of formulas. <br><h3>  Summation of cells with the condition IF. </h3><br>  In order to operate with logical formulas, and they usually contain large data arrays, they are placed into an array of formulas ARRAYFORMULA (formula). <br><ul><li>  Description: summarizes cells with an IF condition (SUMIF formula). </li><li>  Formula Type: = SUMIF ('Sheet'!

And you need to buy it.  Each friend should bring a hot drink.  You need to know the number of bottles of beer that you want to bring, and give the task to your friends. <br><ul><li>  Description: Amount IF (with many conditions). </li><li>  Formula view: = SUMIF ('Data'!

As a result, in the D53 cell, the result will be that we need to purchase 15 bottles of beer.  (Figure 23.1) that is, the formula will determine the amount of two criteria - beer and the number of friends. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bb1/b83/1ac/bb1b831accbe76fda7eacdcbd96745b0.jpg" alt="ok"><br>  <strong><em>Figure 23.1</em></strong> <br>  If there are more such positions, lines 16 and 21 (Figure 24), then the number of bubbles in column G is summed (Figure 24.1). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2cf/337/f14/2cf337f149efd8e9a502000afabd15a6.jpg" alt="ok"><br>  <strong><em>Figure 24</em></strong> <br>  Total: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b35/d51/c15/b35d51c157ab5b4cea99754ae6f4bebf.jpg" alt="ok"><br>  <strong><em>Figure 24.1</em></strong> <br><h3>  Now we give a more interesting example: </h3><br>  Ha ... the party goes on, and you remember that you need a cake, but not an easy one, but a super one - a mega cake, with different spices, which, unfortunately, are also encrypted under digital symbols.  The challenge is to buy spices in the right amount of bags of each of the spices.  The chef encrypted the required amount into a table (Figure 25.1), columns A and B (in the adjacent columns we do our calculations). <br>  Each spice has its own serial number: 1,2,3,4.  (Figure 25). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9b1/10a/af0/9b110aaf03dafffe4a379430d8a852e1.jpg" alt="ok"><br>  <strong><em>Figure 25</em></strong> <br>  Our task is to count the number of duplicate values, in our case, these are numbers from 1 to 4 in column B and determine how many percent fall on each of the spices. <br><ul><li>  Description: Count the number of identical digits in large arrays under additional conditions. </li><li>  Formula view: READ IF ('Formula'!

Perhaps for this you have to change the appearance of the initial data. <br>  Go to the next example. <br><h3>  Count the values ‚Äã‚Äãin the merged cells. </h3><br>  If the formulas use values ‚Äã‚Äãin ‚Äúmerged cells‚Äù, then the first cell for the merged data is indicated, in our case it is column F, and cell F65 (Figure 26) <br><ul><li>  Description: A formula for counting values ‚Äã‚Äãwith the @ symbol. </li><li>  Formula view: READ IF (In column F of the ‚ÄúFormula‚Äù sheet there is text with the contents of @). </li><li>  The formula itself: = COUNTIF ('Formula'!

But with the correct understanding of these formulas, it is possible to perform such miracles with them as, for example: counting words without taking into account the words of exceptions.  Examples below. <br><ul><li>  Description: Count the number of cells containing digits without text variables. </li><li>  Type of formula: COUNT (value_1; value_2; ... value_30) </li><li>  The formula itself: = COUNT (E45; F45; G45; H45) </li></ul><br>  We have the initial data in the range of cells E70: H70, and the result in cell D70 (Figure 27 - counting cells containing numerical values ‚Äã‚Äãin the range in which there are cells with text). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/599/e95/303/599e95303c690587ff0928e6953b1d4d.jpg" alt="ok"><br>  <strong><em>Figure 27.</em></strong> <br>  Cells containing text and numbers are also not counted. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9a6/fe6/c4c/9a6fe6c4c66c72c9cdaa47f43c4ff942.jpg" alt="ok"><br>  <strong><em>Figure 27.1.</em></strong> <br><h3>  Counting the number of cells containing digits with text variables. </h3><br><ul><li>  Description: Count the number of cells containing digits with text variables. </li><li>  Type of formula: COUNTA (value_1; value_2; ... value_30) </li><li>  The formula itself: = COUNTA (E46: H46) </li></ul><br>  We have the initial data in the range of cells E71: H71, and the result in cell D71 (Figure 28 - the counting of all values ‚Äã‚Äãin the range). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cea/306/ef3/cea306ef321b6338b0d6a0df4f712d3f.jpg" alt="ok"><br>  <strong><em>Figure 28.</em></strong> <br>  Also, the formula considers cells that contain only punctuation marks, tabs, but does not count empty cells. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d00/069/091/d00069091f905dd6a19acd9b5d0330dd.jpg" alt="ok"><br>  <strong><em>Figure 28.1</em></strong> <br><h3>  Substitution of values ‚Äã‚Äãunder conditions. </h3><br><ul><li>  Description: substitution of values ‚Äã‚Äãunder conditions. </li><li>  Formula: "= IF (AND ((Condition1); (Condition2)); The result is 0 if condition 1 and 2 is met; if not, the result is 1)" </li><li>  The formula itself: "= IF (AND ((F73 = 5); (H73 = 5)); 0; 1)" </li></ul><br>  We have the initial data in cells F73 and H73, and the result in cell D73 (If F73 = 5 and H73 = 5, then D73 = 0 in all other cases 1) (Figure 29). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4e1/f71/33b/4e1f7133bb045d31d47d8614fb0af557.jpg" alt="ok"><br>  <strong><em>Figure 29.</em></strong> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ee7/d5d/b9f/ee7d5db9f338adc1ae24618a7fc61dee.jpg" alt="ok"><br>  <strong><em>Figure 29.1</em></strong> <br>  Let's complicate the example. <br>  Count the number of cells in which time frames are written without taking into account the words ‚Äúauto answer‚Äù, ‚Äúbusy‚Äù, ‚Äú-‚Äù. <br><ul><li>  Type of the formula: "= COUNTA (Range_A) -COUNTIF (Range_A;" Auto Answer ") - COUNTIF (Range_A;" - ") - COUNTIF (Range_A;" Busy ")" </li></ul><br><ul><li>  The formula itself: = COUNTA ($ E74: $ H75) -COUNTIF ($ E74: $ H75; ‚ÄúAuto Answer‚Äù) - COUNTIF ($ E74: $ H75; "-") - COUNTIF ($ E74: $ H75; "Busy" ) </li></ul><br>  We have the initial data in the range of cells E74: H75, and the result in cell D74 (Figure 30). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/442/8e0/bda/4428e0bda2d095e1ddc6b3f1c32e318c.jpg" alt="ok"><br>  <strong><em>Figure 30</em></strong> <br>  So we‚Äôve come to the end of our little educational program using formulas in Google SpreadSheet and I have high hopes that I have shed light on some aspects of analytical work with formulas. <br>  The formulas, to be honest, were literally suffered.  Each of them was created over time.  I hope you enjoyed my article and the examples in it. <br>  And finally, as a gift.  And forgive me, the developers! <br><h3>  Formula ‚ÄúKILLER OF DOCUMENT‚Äù. </h3><br>  If you need to hide the document from the eyes of others forever, then this formula is for you. <br>  The formula itself: "= (ARRAYFORMULA (SUMIF ($ A: $ A &amp; $ C: $ C; $ H: $ H &amp; F $ 2; $ C: $ C)))".  $ H: $ H governs the distribution of the formula.  After fomlula run (Figure 31), below in the cells, it will begin to multiply the next function CONTINUE (cell; row; column). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/be5/938/cda/be5938cda386e0c713392444cf5b3ab7.jpg" alt="ok"><br>  <strong><em>Figure 31</em></strong> <br>  The formula cyclically adds formulas to the entire column.
