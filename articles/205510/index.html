  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Codecademy released the first mobile application for learning programming</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today, the Codecademy guys took their first step in creating applications and released an introductory programming course that can be completed in less than an hour. <br><br>  The launch of the application was timed to an interesting event of <a href="http://csedweek.org/">Computer Science Education Week</a> , which aims to convince 10 million American students to study programming for one hour (it is supported by Apple, Facebook, the government represented by Obama, famous people).  The broader goal of the app is to create a series of lessons that you can take a little on the go, which is great for busy people who want to learn new skills. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9fe/e16/9ba/9fee169ba5d138a23d10fb6419334837.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5ce/6fd/2ee/5ce6fd2ee170eb01edbe82f2d3d2c68f.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a>

      Director and founder Zack Sims says that in the end, the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/codecademy-hour-of-code/id762950096">Codecademy for iPhone</a> will become their own independent learning platform.  The first version contains only a few basic features - it shows you how programming looks and explains its main functions - but the team hopes to release new content this week. <br><br>  The application was created in order to become a super simple first step for further learning programming.  Text reviews that you receive after each question inspire you, make you feel that you have coped with the task and well motivate your fragile, but easily inflated ego. <br><br>  At the moment, the entire training program is divided into five parts, passing into one another: an introduction ("Welcome"), Data Types, Variables, Comparison and If ... Else.  Each section contains several examples and questions that make up a series of small lessons. <br><br>  The learning process itself is designed with the usual limitations of mobile devices: a small screen and the inability to type a lot of text.  While Codecademy's desktop service supports learning by completing tasks, the application follows a different path.  Instead of writing their own code, users write small fragments in lines of code, and in most cases several variants of answers are already presented.  In some sections, instead of answering the question, you just need to click the "Run" button. <br><br>  Some questions seem ridiculously simple.  For example, in the introductory section you are asked ‚ÄúCan you write a program that calculates how much will be '6-2 ‚Ä≤?‚Äù, And you just need to substitute a minus sign in ‚Äúprint (6? 2);‚Äù (you need to click on "?" and choose the correct answer). <br><br>  You can laugh and say that programming is for dummies, that you will make your own application and get rich. <br><br>  The only problem is that the appendix does not provide any definitions and you have to google some answers.  Most likely, this will be fixed over time, as Codecademy continues to develop the mobile wing of its business. <br><br>  Sims says the goal is to create a platform-independent product, and cites the educational company Duolingo as a successful example.  But there are restrictions when writing your own code, so it will be very interesting how Codecademy will cope with this. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/205510/">https://habr.com/ru/post/205510/</a></p>
