The best shepherds will be Koreans.  To do this, understand the neural interface - a small antenna, powered by currents and vibrations of the body.  It is necessary to thrust exactly into place.  They will come up with a cheap technology - so that even the shepherd can perform neuroimplantation.  It will be done to the newborn right away - the skull of a lamb is thin, the easiest of all.

      Greens that will rip and howl will raise - let the other green ones use <b>compound feed</b> - the Pentagon.  But so that no one noticed.  They are directly involved here, this is all their notion originally.  But I will not tell you why.  <i>And today you eat pork, and tomorrow pork eats you ...</i> <br><br>  Over the herd will fly autonomous drones on solar panels.  Commute connections, transfer the picture to the shepherd‚Äôs terminal.  Wolves blurt out.  Network anywhere on the planet. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Two drone - for stereo.  For the third world countries, there is even a combat option.  Without warranty, written off, they are no longer on the documents.  Purely to drive away wolves and shoot at bottles.  And so that the shepherds do not move each other out of boredom or there on the blue theme - the dealer is locked up to activate weapons except in the radius of the shepherd's territory (stitched in a chip).  Protection on quantum cryptography - military grade. <br><br>  A month later, a <b>jailbreak</b> will pop up.  Next morning its author will emerge in the collector.  Accidentally downloaded will be discharged for $ 1 million - a bomb, including the bill for the departure.  But the 0day exploit will still leak.  Hackers sent by competitors will hack drones, intercepting herd management and hijacking it. <br><br>  The first commercial <b>sheep virus will begin to infect herds</b> ‚Äî paralyzing supplies and causing panic over mutton futures.  Rumor of a virus frying the brain of an animal through a neural interface.  Kaspersky Lab 50% discount opens the start of sales of Shepherd Security Suite.  Several prestigious European colleges and one Makhachkala cattle school in a hurry will open certification programs for security specialists of automated livestock management systems. <br><br>  ISIS is organizing the attack using hijacked drone and hacked sheep as a means of delivery.  Police are instructed to shoot unidentified sheep to kill.  For maximum stopping effect - from the grenade <b>launcher</b> . <br><br>  Sheepcraft's announcement will be held - the first real-time strategy that has a flock of sheep in the system requirements.  Members of the International Federation of Sports Sheepdogs will select Sheepcraft as the main competitive discipline.  At a press conference, the Dagestan national team will sign a contract with Razer. <br><br>  Nomads living far from civilization are protesting against the forced <b>cyberization of livestock</b> .  Meanwhile, at the Film Academy ceremony, the award will be given to the 3D model of Tom Cruise, in the Visual FX nomination. <br><br>  On the WCG, a Stream of Ovcekraft gathers more viewers than any other.  Experienced progamers are moving into a <b>more promising</b> new discipline - some teams even buy training flocks.  Among the residents of Korean cities there is a fashion to start a domestic sheep.  For the first time, the Seoul Police will receive a statement on rape of a domestic sheep <i>[the criminal case will be denied due to the peculiarities of the legislative framework that does not include the concept of free will in domestic cattle]</i> . <br><br>  A video of targeted police shooting at a suspected sheep from a grenade launcher will appear online.  There will also be a video recorded in a helicopter by the US Marine Corps, which captures the shooting of wild herds of sheep from a Minigun machine gun.  The military prosecutor's office will express interest in the video. <br><br>  Google will buy a startup implanted bioreactor in the intestine.  Scandalous bio-charging for an iPad with anal feeding turns out to be a fake.  Apple shares fall by 2%.  General Electric announces a 100-watt biocompatible unit with sheep insides.  The first DIY devices appear.  A Canadian experimental amateur goes to hospital with extensive chemical burns of the colon mucosa. <br><br>  The herds, automatically controlled by intelligent algorithms as part of cloud clusters, will finally force out small businesses. <br><br>  The world is fascinated by the revolutionary stereo stick for selfies, which at the end of the day raised $ 2 million. <br><br>  And so, the last flock, which is under manual administration, will be transferred to a standalone cloud hosting.  Shepherds sink into oblivion, not even having time to form a trade union.  Some will be seen on starcraft servers - but most will go underground, managing herds on chip implants and stolen software - from time to time getting into police raids and news reports. <br><br>  DARPA will present a prototype of a light-armored, remote-controlled sheep equipped with an exoskeleton and large-caliber small arms. <br><br>  Wired devotes the number of breakthrough technology in the construction of data centers: " <b>autonomous computing node based on a sheep</b> ."  Recent developments in the field of a powerful autonomous electric power generator integrated into biological tissues and animal metabolism will allow us to place a wearable server on it that performs useful calculations.  This server is naturally cooled by the environment and runs smoothly throughout the life of the protein chassis. <br><br>  <b>United Herds Incorporated ‚Ñ¢</b> , which develops a turnkey data center based on a herd, announces pre-orders for its basic model: self-powered digestion, an IBM ready server solution, a 5G directional antenna with a UAV heading correction system.  Peak herd capacity up to 50 PFlop. <br><br>  The term <b>date-herd ‚Ñ¢ is used.</b> <br><br>  In collaboration with air carriers, the American startup announces services for the rapid deployment of <b>sheep mobile computing centers</b> anywhere in the world: you click on Google Maps, and at the selected point, the already mounted infrastructure parachutes from a robotic cargo plane on parachutes, and is immediately ready for operation - having only experienced a little stress. <br><br>  ... on the launch day, a software crash leads to the discharge of livestock in the Barents Sea area, and to the destruction of a cargo drone - after crossing the restricted area and activating the air defense system.  The Defense Ministry billed for $ 45 million. There are rumors about the imminent takeover of the company. <br><br>  DARPA shows the tactical group of fighting cyberized sheep: with a decentralized decision-making system and a system of recognizing someone else's.  Several such groups are automatically organized into a platoon, several platoons into a company;  the decision-making system is automatically scaled to the required level and has a high degree of autonomy: the group can perform tasks of the type seek and destroy in a completely uninterrupted mode, without the participation of the operator. <br><br>  The <b>InfiniHealth¬Æ</b> startup will launch to the market a service of implanting biosensors connected to the emergency planetary service of monitoring the biometric states of the flocks being serviced in order to provide automatic emergency assistance, if necessary.  If the sheep cluster, due to inaccurate geo-exploration data, was deployed under adverse conditions to autonomously maintain its own energy supply, the company's unmanned cargo aircraft will deliver an accurately calculated amount of ‚Äúcompressed hay A‚Äù to any place on the planet. * <br><br>  Shortly after the public presentation of the technology, InfiniHealth¬Æ will be acquired by United Stakes Incorporated ‚Ñ¢ for an unnamed amount. <br><br>  As a result of a series of takeovers and bankruptcies, <b>United Herds Incorporated ‚Ñ¢</b> , becoming the world's largest supplier of software and hardware for computing herds, announce the development of a single resilient digestive-digestive system for building a <b>global scale sheep ‚Äì grid</b> . <br><br>  According to OSI ‚Ñ¢, the network will have the ability to regenerate and replicate itself, independently carrying out all operational and economic activities about the production, storage and logistics of the main structural elements of themselves - all the production, warehouse and transport infrastructure necessary for this is already robotic and computerized, and able to work without supervision and participation of specialists. <br><br>  Part of the marketing of washing the ears of investors, from the press release: <br><br>  *** <br><br>  <i>The development is an intellectual balancer of tasks and resource consumption, connecting all computational sheep on the planet into a single network, possessing a number of self-organizing properties: geometric, topological and holographic - making it isotropic and symmetrical on any scales and in any basis.</i>  <i>This achieves the predictability of extrapolations of statistical network models and the quality of decisions made.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>From any initial configuration, the network is organized into a fractal-fragmented hierarchy of scales.</i>  <i>The network is split up into atomic elements - sensors and power of a separate cyber brain.</i>  <i>The network tends to be distributed in such a way that on every scale of crushing each element forms on average an equal number of links.</i>  <i>Each disconnected network fragment contains a model of the entire network ‚Äî reproducing it as accurately as the fragment volume allows.</i>  <i>When merging fragments, transfer accuracy improves in proportion to size.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Such an organization allows you to implement the basic life instinct in a decentralized architecture in the right way.</i>  <i>If the fragment does not remember the entire network, then when disconnected, each of them will act selfishly - which is equivalent to the destruction of the network.</i>  <i>If the fragment contains at least the similarity of the entire network, then when disconnected, it will act conditionally as if it were connected to it anyway.</i>  <i>Cut into cubes of lettuce, the net continues to work for some time just as if it had not been cut, and this would allow it to drag on in the fastest way.</i>  <i>The anthill is similarly constructed.</i> <br><br>  *** <br><br>  A few years later, an unidentified malfunction in the mechanisms controlling the planetary sheep's brain will cause people <b>to lose control</b> of it. <br><br>  Some would suspect even then: there was probably no control: there was simply no moment when control began to get lost - there was a moment when it became noticeable.  Perhaps it is just a coincidence that for some time this thing did exactly what they wanted from it - and in fact could not have done it from the very beginning! <br><br>  The futility of armed confrontation will be immediately obvious: it cannot be turned off, it is senseless to cut, prick, blow up - this is more tenacious than a person.  It is more perfect.  Breaking it would be a tremendous effort ... and in the end people would look stupid and sorry.  This is how to defeat the wall.  Breaking it only because it does not do what they want from it? .. <br><br>  It will take some time, and we all, one day, understand: why it still continues to fulfill some of our desires.  This is not because we have not completely lost control - no ... how vain it was to think so!  Approximately how do you <i>control your friend</i> when you ask him for something: transfer the salt, go fishing, dolganut the mower until tomorrow. <br><br>  <b>At some point, we all will be ashamed.</b> <br><br>  The planetary ovine cyber brain is recognized by the UN and the seat in the Big Nine, having [symbolic] nuclear weapons and colonies on Jupiter‚Äôs satellites.  For the first time, the vegetarian party is leading in the US congressional elections. <br><br>  Moscow police will detain several natives of Dagestan, conducting single pickets in protest against the bill adopted on first reading on listing nasvay on the Federal Drug Control Service. <br><br>  For two hours a few hours captcha will not work. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/390681/">https://habr.com/ru/post/390681/</a></p>
