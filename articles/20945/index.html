  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why Mac?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/456/9d5/674/4569d5674a23092bdafa9f1fcc7d0754.png" alt="mac windows linux"><br>  Many of my friends and acquaintances asked lately why I moved from PC to Mac. <br>  I explained to the first two people who asked, but the rest of the forces were not enough :-) <br>  So I promised everyone else to write an extended note on the blog and discuss it in the comments. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  First, a little history.  This will largely explain my view of things in the computer world. <br>  I have been familiar with computers since 10 years old, my first computer was the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum">ZX Spectrum</a> with programs on tapes <br>  and built-in basic interpreter.  By the end of school I already had a normal <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BF%25D1%258C%25D1%258E%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580">PC</a> , and <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows">Windows</a> <br>  For me, nothing new or interesting.  Then in search of a sphere for <br>  studying I decided to dig into the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix">unix-system</a> .  Therefore, in the first year I already got a practice <br>  to the local internet site as admin assistant.  Where in three years I mastered all the main techniques of <strong>unix-fu</strong> . <br>  Since then, for me, the command line has become indispensable and necessary for comfortable and fast work on the computer. <br>  Over the next few years, I gradually changed the scope of work from admin to programmer, <br>  or rather became a web developer.  For full-fledged work, I then needed <a href="http://www.adobe.com/">Adobe</a> products - <br>  Photoshop and Illustrator.  Therefore it was necessary to change to Windows.  But the development itself is all the same to me <br>  it was more convenient to conduct using the command line and terminal editor (vim).  At that time, I was already knowledgeable about <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X">MacOSX</a> and software for this <br>  the platform.  So my hands itch more and more to try to get my favorite <strong>unix</strong> from the command line and with a set of graphics programs from <strong>Adobe</strong> . <br>  And now, after <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B6%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D1%2581,_%25D0%25A1%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD_%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB">Steve Jobs</a> announced the release of a <a href="http://www.apple.com/intel/">Mac on the Intel platform</a> , rumors of hack versions sprang up. <br>  <strong>MacOSX</strong> , which run <strong>on ordinary PC</strong> .  Of course, I did not stand aside and decided to ‚Äútry my luck‚Äù :-) <br>  Finding a MacOSX hack was easy on the network, and finding a working hardware for it too.  So literally <br>  a few weeks after the news, I was already the owner of a self-made <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSx86">hackintosh</a> ! <br>  I worked for more than a year in Hakintosh, studying the software and the system itself.  Then the course ‚Äú <strong>Na Mac!</strong> ‚Äù Was adopted <strong>.</strong>  " <br>  The rest was a matter of time and money, of course. <br>  Now I am writing this post in <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> on a <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/">MacBookPro 15 ‚Äù</a> . <br>  And now from the lyrics to the practice.  What is so good and unique in the platform from Apple. <br>  I will not sing Deferamba about Mac and will not spit in the direction of PC and M $ in particular. <br>  Everything has its purpose and place.  Therefore, first about the tasks. <br><ol><li>  As a <strong>web developer,</strong> I need server software (for example: <em>php / python / ruby ‚Äã‚Äã/ apache / mysql</em> ), <br>  text editor and image editor.  In principle, only Windows would be enough for me to practice layout. <br>  but it is too inconvenient to work with server programming (who needs points, write in the comments). <br>  Linux solves the issue of server programming well in this case, but it‚Äôs almost impossible to typeset it from PSD or AI. <br>  On the Mac, there are Adobe graphics packages and easy installation of software for server programming.  So it turns out <br>  universal soldier for web development is Mac.  I can say that almost the entire arsenal of programs (usually <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSource">OpenSource</a> ) <br>  for Linux, works like a bang and on a Mac.  It is easy to install and update via the <a href="http://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a> package system. </li><li>  I have more hobbies and activities besides work :-).  The first of which is <strong>music</strong> . <br>  I play guitar and keyboards.  Composing music.  Therefore, the availability of good software for recording <br>  music for me necessarily.  As well as support for professional audio devices. <br>  On Windows, it's all there.  Under Mac, no fewer devices work and Mac software is also provided. <br>  And its big plus is the availability of free <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/garageband/">GarageBand</a> , which is enough for <br>  for the accumulation of musical material and amateur recording.  Special attention <br>  It is worth the usability of the latest version of Apple's <a href="http://www.apple.com/logicstudio/logicpro/">Logic Studio / Express</a> . </li><li>  My second hobby is <strong>photography</strong> .  Here, in principle, products for working with graphics <br>  in cases with Windows and Mac are almost identical, therefore, the weight of this item, I think, is zero. <br>  Linux is also good at handling photo processing, albeit with other software. </li></ol><br>  So we can conclude that Mac really wins only on the first point - <strong>web development</strong> . <br>  Another important point.  Which in many cases probably outweighs the bowl towards the Mac platform <br>  for professionals.  This is the MacOSX operating system itself and a lot of attention to the convenience (ergonomics) of Apple products. <br>  More details.  So, I think any programmer (oh, how I ‚Äúlove‚Äù this word) faced a problem <br>  when, after several hours of active work, he began to sink in an abundance of windows and application dialogs. <br>  I will not argue for a long time, but just give my example.  By lunchtime, I usually already had a critical mass <br>  of these ‚Äúwindows and dialogs‚Äù and I started actively closing / collapsing everything, which led to an additional loss of time <br>  and to a little annoyance at the end of the day ... Many Windows users are just used to this process. <br>  On Linux, this problem is solved quite effectively.  Large selection of <strong>window managers</strong> plus their great flexibility <br>  allows you to very effectively manipulate application windows.  The most effective way is to create <strong>virtual desktops</strong> .  By the way, this solution migrated to Windows / Mac. <br>  And now a little ‚Äúpuzomerok‚Äù, of course subjective. <br><ul><li>  <strong>Mac and Linux</strong> wins over windows application management. </li><li>  <strong>Linux</strong> wins Mac and Windows on budget solutions. </li><li>  <strong>Mac and Linux</strong> outperform Windows for system stability. </li><li>  <strong>Mac and Linux</strong> benefit from Windows task processing in multiprocessor (multi-core) configurations. </li><li>  <strong>Windows</strong> wins Mac and Linux with an abundance of software and experts. </li></ul><br>  My findings and advice. <br><ol><li>  I repeat.  In the computer world <strong>there is no panacea</strong> .  There are tasks and their solutions. </li><li>  Windows is suitable for almost all tasks.  But it most likely will not suit lovers of comfort and aesthetics. </li><li>  Linux is a great environment for web programming.  You can successfully use to work with photos. </li><li>  Mac will be of interest to professionals in the field of web, audio / video production, design and photography. </li></ol><br>  On the last point I want to write a little expanded.  I can judge professionally on the following areas: web development, <br>  audio production and photography.  I have less experience in video production and design, but I can judge fairly objectively. <br>  And one more sphere is working with 3D, which is difficult for me to judge.  So, I strongly advise anyone to try Mac: <br><ul><li>  web developers; </li><li>  designers; </li><li>  musicians; </li><li>  video editing specialists and specials.  effects; </li><li>  photographers. </li></ul><br>  I can also add that Mac is very popular among journalists and scholars.  I cannot give exact facts. <br>  If anyone has - write.  I will say that the photo and video materials of various journalistic and scientific conferences <br>  I can simply state a fact. <br>  In the article I deliberately did not provide a list of software products (software) for the Mac platform.  Because  this is a whole series of articles <br>  for future issues of <a href="http://appleworms.ru/">appleworms.ru</a> </div>
