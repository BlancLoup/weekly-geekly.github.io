      Millions of cars are rushing somewhere every day - if you look closely, there is only one driver in almost every car, around which at least three more places are empty.  This space is used idle, and after all there with comfort passengers could go!  What is the conclusion from this?  That's right - you need to combine several people to travel in one car!  You do not need to be a genius to calculate the "gain" from this approach - the number of cars can be reduced at least 2-3 times!  Not to mention the number of accidents, dirt and exhausts. <br><br>  An example of this practice can be observed in America.  There, such a program is supported at the state level and for drivers in whose cars there are two or more people, even there is a special lane for traffic! <br><br>  We are confident that such an approach to solving the problem of traffic jams can be very effective at minimal cost.  No need to wait and hope that the state will come to such a decision - now nothing prevents to create such a movement.  And the state will be able to call for help (to provide various privileges to drivers) when there will be at least some results.  Our society is ready for this today, and therefore we dedicate our resource to a city free of traffic jams! <br><br>  In fact, our site consists of only a few pages, the main of which is the search and creation of a route.  For those who created the route, two more pages are available - personal data and routes created.  The interface is as simple as possible, so the search for the desired route is carried out with just a few clicks, and creating a route takes 30 seconds more! <br><br>  - You can find a route and contact its driver without registering on the site.  However, there is registration on the site - it is very convenient and happens in a semi-automatic mode when creating a route.  The user indicates the direction, an automatically generated password arrives at his email - already with this data he will be able to manage his created routes and edit personal information. <br><br>  As you can see, our service is also suitable for those who do not yet have their own car, and movement in space is not limited to any one city.  Now it will be much easier to go to any city in Russia or gather people for a football match, open air, or find a company to go snowboarding in the winter.  We believe that our site only contributes to this.  And we know that all this there is still a lot of applications! <br><br>  We are gradually improving the project and listening to all the opinions of our users - we are open and always available for communication.  So if you have any comments or additions, then send them to us by email, which is listed on our website gowithme.ru <br><br>  And thank you all for your support and participation!  After all, only by joint efforts you can create a free city of traffic jams, a developed country, as well as a bright, loving and kind world around you! <br><br>  <b>"Come with me" to change for the better!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/109881/">https://habr.com/ru/post/109881/</a></p>
