What do they think in Yandex</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today begins the new school year.  Hundreds of people who will become programmers in the future have become first-year students or will continue to study further.  But not the fact that they will have everything written in the diploma "programmer".  Is it important for them at all?  This time we decided to ask Yandex employees if the programmer needs a specialized education. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/1leMvUk8nao%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhj3ASgDO-n_PAqJxJvNOjiZoffo1A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  By the way, we often say that Yandex is a company created by programmers.  But, as Yandex co-founder Arkady Volozh somehow corrected me, none of the creators of Yandex had a ‚Äúprogrammer‚Äù written in the diploma.  What our other colleagues told you, as always, you can read under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Andrew <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/styskin/" class="user_link">styskin</a> Styskin</b> <br>  <i>Programs 18 years.</i>  <i>In Yandex - 9 years.</i> <br>  Came to Yandex by a Java developer to the Market search group.  He was engaged in the classification of commodity texts and the extraction of facts from product descriptions.  So began his passion for search and machine learning.  Outside of work, Andrei made various IR-toys: a generator of poems on language models, a robot for pumping social networks.  Now Andrey is in charge of the ranking department, in which a team of almost 200 people works.

These are mathematicians, physicists, people with an economic education or other types of technical who were so fond of programming, that they went to programmers.  And it is thanks to this love, and not to their ability, that everything turns out so well.  Therefore, I can not assess how useful the education of a programmer is.  But, for example, managerial education was very useful for me at some stage. <br><br>  I wonder how much education, even at the same School of data analysis, affects motivation and love for their work.  If it helps to love your tasks more and more, then this is very cool.  And if a person has learned this, can, but does not love and thinks how to build a career in another field, then it can and does harm.  I am very interested in how to identify this in people at an early stage. </blockquote><br><br>  <b>Mikhail Parakhin</b> <br>  <i>Programs 24 years.</i>  <i>In Yandex - 9 months.</i> <br><br>  After graduating from the MEPhI, he began working at ZAO SEC Modul.  In the 90s it was almost the only place in Moscow where they were engaged in automated learning systems.  Then he went to the company Parascript, which is actually a monopolist in the field of handwriting and typed text recognition.  For many years he worked in the United States.  The last seven years have been Microsoft, five of which headed the multimedia search services division at Bing.  In the spring I came to Yandex as search technology director. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5d5/d8e/0eb/5d5d8e0eb59d4f8686f29a634105e6bb.jpg"><br><br><blockquote>  If it is considered to be a programmer education under the profile, then probably not necessarily.  I have a selfish moment here, because I don‚Äôt have one - I‚Äôm a physicist by training.  Although the physicist never worked.  I am a self-taught programmer and it seems to me that it never bothered me.  Therefore, I think that specialized education is not at all necessary. </blockquote><br><br>  <b>Andrew <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/yafinder/" class="user_link">yafinder</a> Plakhov</b> <br>  <i>Programs 24 years.</i>  <i>In Yandex - 6 years.</i> <br><br>  He came to Yandex in 2008 as a senior developer.  His first task was to create a new type of ranking factors - domain.  Engaged in ranking, created a system Spectrum.  Candidate of Physical and Mathematical Sciences.  Now manages the search functionality service - in particular, develops search tips.

One of them came and said: ‚ÄúI am the only person who has a specialized education, a programmer‚Äôs education‚Äù.  We were surprised: ‚ÄúAs the only one?‚Äù He replied: ‚ÄúAnd so.  You see what people have written in diplomas - no one has written a ‚Äúprogrammer‚Äù, but mine has written it.  Because I graduated from vocational school, where they teach a programmer. ‚Äù  But I do not understand what a specialized education is.  Applied Mathematics? <br><br>  It is true that people who have passed the ShAD are epic people who are here and where they are still torn off with their hands, but I do not know why this happens.  Perhaps, it is precisely such people who can go there for selection and complete their studies.  In general, it is very nice when a person, who just came from an educational institution, immediately speaks the same language with you, understands some things, a jargon, has already managed to do something with his hands in the same field.  But in classical Computer Science there are a lot of rather outdated things.  For example, a large notation has little relevance to real work.  It is clear that someday the state of affairs with the training will change, but before that it will take another 10 years. </blockquote><br><br>  <b>Stepan Koltsov</b> <br>  <i>Programs 10 years.</i>  <i>In Yandex - 7 years.</i> <br><br>  Senior developer in the development of data storage and processing systems.

If we are talking about serious programming, which is in Yandex in many places, then a person should know mathematics.  But this mathematics is not a profile education, because mathematics is separate - programming is separate.  Relatively speaking, the programmer should be able to write and read, but specialized education in the sense that it should be taught to program is not necessary.  A ShAD is more a very specific mathematics that is needed for serious projects.  And learning programming, necessary for the tasks that people usually solve, it seems, in Russia and not.  And, it seems to me, it is not necessary, because programming itself is a very simple thing.  Anyone can learn how to program himself on a book in two months. </blockquote><br><br>  <b>Artem <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/breqwas/" class="user_link">Breqwas</a> Kireev</b> <br>  <i>Programs 12 years.</i>  <i>In Yandex - 8 years.</i> <br><br>  Yandex was called for parsing data from Blog Search.

Once I studied at the institute on the specialty "Applied Mathematics".  I went there because I thought: ‚ÄúWow, mathematics.  Applied.  Probably, they will teach me how to write programs. ‚Äù  No, not taught.  I was taught mathematics and, many years later, I learned that she did have some applications, but they didn‚Äôt tell me about them.  And I was sure that I was taught a boring, dull and not interesting math, and left the institute.  I have no higher education.  Maybe I was not lucky and somewhere in Russia everything is different. </blockquote><br><br>  <b>Mikhail <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/mlevin/" class="user_link">mlevin</a> Levin</b> <br>  <i>Programs 18 years.</i>  <i>In Yandex - 5 years.</i> <br><br>  You could see Misha‚Äôs lecture on how mathematics helps Yandex earn money.  A very large part of his work is work in our academic programs.  He teaches at the School of Data Analysis, participates in creating a curriculum at the Faculty of Computer Science at HSE and Yandex.  Twice he won medals at ACM ICPC in the team of Moscow State University.  Mv  Lomonosov. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b19/202/be6/b19202be6e4140c1b775605a94b74b1d.jpg"><br><br><blockquote>  I finished the program, and it never focused on programming.  The fact that a lot of programmers came from there is a consequence of two things.  First, in the country it was not very possible to earn money as a scientist, and secondly, many people cannot go to pure science.  In essence, it remains to choose to work as a programmer or economist.  The two most popular options. <br><br>  Practical part of the mechanics never taught.  The fact that many of my fellow students work in Google, Yandex, Microsoft, Facebook and other cool companies turned out because the course was strong, and the Olympiad helped a lot.  I had to learn a lot by myself.  If we only took what the university gave, then it would not be enough even to get an internship at Yandex.  Shad is a way to fix a situation.  Mathematical education in our country is not bad in principle, although it is not quite the same as it is sung.  But indeed, the top graduates of the Mekhmat and the VMK do not lose the Harvard top and MIT, but this is some sort of small sample, outside of which there is a sharp decline.  In Western universities, less emphasis is placed on mathematics, but much more practical training.  Graduates can immediately come to the industry and work.  And we had so that people, brilliantly graduated from universities, could not pass the interview for the position of interns. <br><br>  At the new faculty of Computer Science at HSE, we want to immediately try to combine mathematics and programming in more correct proportions.  Less to give compulsory mathematics and more programming courses and practical tasks. </blockquote><br><br>  <b>Pavel Sukhov</b> <br>  <i>Programs - 9 years.</i>  <i>In Yandex - 5 months.</i> <br><br>  He studied at the Nizhny Novgorod branch of the HSE, where he has been teaching for two years.

Exactly no way.  No one is interested in how you gain knowledge, especially in the IT field.  I know an example when a girl came to work as a programmer, having graduated from the conservatory.  And they took her.  At first there were some difficulties with salary, because formally they could not pay her the rate, but now she does not work at the lowest position.  People are interested in your real knowledge and skills.  And even this is not always.  Very often just motivation is important.  Yes, of course, specialized education in something helps, allows you to gain experience in various areas that may suddenly be useful, but this is definitely not a mandatory factor. </blockquote><br><br>  <b>Andrey Mishchenko</b> <br>  <i>Programs 24 years.</i>  <i>In Yandex - 9 years.</i> <br><br>  He came to Yandex as a developer in C ++, for a long time was the head of the Blog Search Development and wrote in Perl.

Of course not.  But I like it when a programmer has a good fundamental education.  This sets the ceiling that the programmer can reach.  You may not have higher education at all, finish school, go learn PHP, gain 10 years of experience and be a very good web developer.  That is, you can very quickly do some online shopping, and it is clear what level of work you will have.  You will receive a very good salary, make quality products within the framework of the tasks taken, but the lack of education will keep you.  You will not be able to rise higher and do any deeper things.  For example, search, recommender systems, their own algorithms - some high-tech things.  You will have a completely different job level. </blockquote><br><br>  <b>Anatoly <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/anatolix/" class="user_link">Anatolix</a> Orlov</b> <br>  <i>Programs 25 years.</i>  <i>In Yandex - 9 years.</i> <br><br>  The first two years he wrote Market.

I can say that it is worth sharing education as a concept for the transfer of knowledge, training and education as a diploma.  I would say that knowledge is necessary for a programmer, but a diploma, in fact, not really.  Obtaining knowledge is not necessary in a higher educational institution ‚Äî it can be self-education.  If you are unlucky, and you did not have a good university, then you just have to see a lot of lectures.  There is nothing wrong. </blockquote><br><br>  <b>Gregory <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/bobuk/" class="user_link">Bobuk</a> Bakunov</b> <br>  <i>Programs 25 years.</i>  <i>In Yandex - 10 years.</i> <br><br>  Once came to work as a system administrator, and now - director of technology distribution. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/05e/231/8fc/05e2318fca479c32d3f2d638828727bc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><blockquote>  I know two or three universities that prepare programmers for real.  All the rest are such indirect, related specialties.  It seems to me that the programmer, of course, gets most of his knowledge in the process of self-education.  Nevertheless, a profile education allows you to get all that allows you to get any other education.  First of all - the right connections, the right acquaintances, the ability to communicate with people of their profession, which is also very important.  Then the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow life is organized in the industry.  These are things that specialized education should give.  Programmers must learn to communicate with other programmers, as well as with people from related specialties.  They have to imagine how the life in the industry works, what version control systems are and how they live with it all.  Education should give basic knowledge of the immediate specialty, because a person must learn to perceive the rest from the surrounding space himself.  In fact, Russia already has several universities that have begun to move in this direction.  And in the world, probably, there are three or four universities that live according to this scheme. </blockquote><br><br>  <b>Elena Bunina</b> <br>  <i>In Yandex - 7 years.</i> <br><br>  Director of computer science at the School of Data Analysis, HR-Director of Yandex, Professor of the Department of Higher Algebra of the Mechanics and Mathematics Faculty of Moscow State University.

But it seems to me that it is still better to learn programming early enough.  So it will be much easier to move from language to language, for example.  A person who learned this in the early years is somehow easier to live.  There are software engineers who are not very interested in Computer Science itself, they are more likely techies.  But those programmers who are interested in something new to invent and analyze, they just need to study this science. </blockquote><br><br>  <b>Oleg Klimin</b> <br>  <i>Programs - 23 years.</i>  <i>In Yandex - a year.</i> <br><br>  He graduated from the Nizhny Novgorod State University.

I do not have a programming education, which, in general, does not interfere with the work of a programmer.  I know people who graduated from the Faculty of Economics or some humanitarian faculties, and at the same time they are excellent programmers.  There are those who received a specialty, but then something did not go, something did not like.  There are many self-taught people who did not finish anything at all.
