All three options will give us their assessment of the "value" of the labor of an employee.

      The problem here is that it is very difficult to weigh up the costs of an employee‚Äôs salary and the value he creates for the company and the entire team.  It is very important for the employee himself to understand the real state of affairs and to be able to influence the situation. <br><br>  Design and development is a serious work that requires time, mental effort and patience, which a person pins as software is optimized and improved.  It would be a shame for any specialist to find out that his time was wasted. <br><br>  Of course, it is worthwhile to apply a multi-factor assessment model and take into account the financial situation in which the company-employer itself is located.  In this case, you need to focus not on a specific amount, but on a range that will be convenient to all parties. <br><br>  Vitaly Gritsay, the CEO of our IaaS provider, is confident that Kent‚Äôs approach has a right to exist.  He stressed that the company needs strong developers and is ready to assign wages above the market.  This approach should be balanced by the employee himself, who will have to raise the level of the company's products.  One of the most significant factors here is the initiative and willingness to take on new ideas and bring them to its logical conclusion. <br><br>  <i>We turned to IT experts and asked them to share their assessments of which approaches to setting wage levels should be considered the most effective.</i> <br><br>  The press service of Aviasales told us that programmers in the company work as part of product groups.  Thus, the successful work of the department depends on each employee.  At the same time, the company focuses on mutual assistance, but does not deny possible distractors, such as reading news from the IT world. <br><br>  Elena Zhuravleva, co-founder of HumanFactorLabs and DaData.ru, says that different KPIs and metrics do not always work.  It is very difficult to determine the cost of a specific bug that has been fixed or lines of code.  This is a creative process that cannot be turned into a permanent hacking KPI of your employer.  This approach is justified in the framework of product development and is additionally fueled by market growth.  It often turns out that it is more profitable to take interns and train them for themselves.  In this case, you can increase the salary on the basis of expanding the range of responsibilities (for example, moving from developer to team lead). <br><br>  PS A little about the work of our IaaS provider: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/1cloud/blog/244121/">About IT infrastructure IaaS-provider</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/1cloud/blog/243133/">About the redesign of our site</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/1cloud/blog/250427/">About the development of our API</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297178/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297178/</a></p>
