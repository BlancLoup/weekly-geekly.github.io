Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and Telegram are leading in this market. <br><br>  Specialists of Activate, which is studying ways to improve the efficiency of employees, believe that within a few years the audience of these services will increase to 3.6 billion people, that is, about half of the world's population. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img width="600" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/80d/73a/115/80d73a115f7d42068590a7d62043c92e.png"></div>

      The number of services based on artificial intelligence is growing every day.  They need a channel to communicate with real people, and chat bots are one of the appropriate options. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  The laws of the economy </h3><br>  Services related to sending messages existed on the Internet from time immemorial, but the birth of ‚Äúbotoeconomy‚Äù can be counted from last June: then Telegram (today it has more than 100 million users) launched a bot platform and a bot store.  Now there are already thousands of bots in it - some broadcast news, others find links to football matches or porn users. <br><br>  Dozens of startups have been created in this area.  Some of them provide tools, for example, Chatfuel - a site that helps create bots for Telegram.  Others offer specialized services: Digit allows you to work with a bank account, Pana is an online travel agency that accepts text requests and turns them into bookings, and MeeKan is designed to create meetings in Slack. <br><br>  The bots' economy also needs industry leaders, and Microsoft and Facebook are eager to play this role - most smartphones work on iOS and Android, and the bots market remains like a ‚Äúdraw‚Äù territory. <br><br>  Of course, there is no guarantee that bots will be as successful as applications.  For developers, advantages can be disadvantages at the same time: if bots are easier to develop, then the competition is higher.  And consumers may be overwhelmed by the abundance of services and ways of interaction. <br><br>  As in the case of applications, in order for bots to find their niche, many experiments will be required, and much depends on the owners of the platforms. <br><br><h3>  Financial bots </h3><br>  In Telegram there are many bots created to facilitate the user business, including investment, as well as help with financial planning.  They can be divided into several main groups. <br><br><h4>  Bots for financial management </h4><br>  These programs, designed for business or personal use, are able to assess the financial situation of a user, manage his daily expenses, show an individual cost structure, and track debts and credits. <br><br>  For example, ExpenseBot (@expensebot) helps to control expenses and get an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe current state of finances using a convenient interface. <br><br>  Money Pie (@MoneyPieBot) helps keep track of loans and debts, including the money that you owe. <br><br><h4>  Bots for work with investments and stock market </h4><br>  There are bots for investment and just to find the right indices.  For example, the Unicorn Bay bot (@UnicornBayBot) provides information on stocks, bonds and exchange-traded funds, allowing you to search for securities on stock exchanges in different countries and giving investment recommendations. <br><br>  If you are a beginner trader, then we suggest you read [here] (https://www.facebook.com/gde.tvoi.dengi/). <br><br>  If you are interested in forex trading, Forex Brokers Reviews (@forexreviewbot) bot is created for you - it will show news and recommendations related to currency trading, help you compare brokers and choose the right one, and also keeps track of stocks and special offers. <br><br>  A Forex Calendar (@fxtm_calendar_bot) will remind you of important economic events. <br><br><h4>  Bots that broadcast financial content </h4><br>  Both the world media and smaller brands understand that instant messengers are a promising new way to preserve existing and attract new readers.  Therefore, they launch bots that are another interface to the newspaper and are ready to send you current information or search the archives for the answer to the request. <br><br>  For example, Business Insider News (@businessinsider_bot) is a news media that provides the user with the latest financial, business and economic data and analytics. <br><br>  Forbesbot (@forbesdotcom_bot), respectively, gives access to the Forbes publication, mainly devoted to business, finance, stock markets, investment banking services, technology, and appropriate lifestyle.  You can choose one of the thematic channels and get a selection of the latest articles twice a day.  For Russian users there is a localized version of Forbes Russia (@forbesrubot). <br><br><h4>  Bank bots </h4><br>  Unlike mobile applications that give the client quick access to money transactions, banking bots still have a rather limited set of functions, and basically they are aimed at the Russian-language segment of Telegram users. <br><br>  For example, Sberbank has an official reference bot assistant (@sberbankbot) - you can ask about the current exchange rate or the nearest ATM.  The bot is available in English and Russian. <br><br>  MoneyTalkBot (@MoneyTalkBot) of Tinkoff Bank is more advanced: it allows you to transfer money to friends or relatives without leaving Telegram.  You just need to add a bank card, and then specify how many rubles and to which number to transfer. <br><br><h4>  Bots for working with wallet or bitcoin exchangers </h4><br>  If you use bitcoins, you also have a number of useful bots.  BTC Banker (@btc_change_bot) allows you to send and receive Bitcoin payments, as well as exchange virtual currency into rubles and dollars. <br><br><h4>  Service bots </h4><br>  These are assistants, designed to facilitate routine operations.  For example, Exchange Rates Bot (@exchangeratesbot) shows real exchange rates for 165 different currencies, as well as their dynamics (according to Yahoo! Finance). <br><br><br>  Financial bots can be useful helpers, expanding our capabilities, but it is worth remembering that Telegram does not have any official bots, so use such programs for, for example, remittances with caution. <br><br>  In fact, you yourself can create a bot.  With the <a href="https://developers.exante.eu/api/">EXANTE Market Data API,</a> you can quickly and easily start developing your own bot: registration in the system does not require additional confirmations, and access to the data is free.  While the API is working in Tech Preview mode, but access is open to all comers. <br><br>  More information on how to create a financial bot, we told in the article <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/exante/blog/318272/">"Financial Telegram-bot in 30 minutes from the Market Data API</a> . <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/exante/blog/318272/">"</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/318706/">https://habr.com/ru/post/318706/</a></p>
