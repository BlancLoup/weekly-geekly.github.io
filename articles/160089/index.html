  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The first two implications of staff interaction</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I work in a company that sells and installs engineering systems: automation (including Smart Home), low-voltage systems (fire and burglar alarms, access control, CCTV systems), electricians and more. <br><br>  I manage the people, both with the office level (customer service managers, suppliers and department managers), and the working level (installers, engineers, brigadiers, ancillary workers). <br><br>  I have been working in this field for more than five years and I do not cease to be surprised at the different situations that develop with my wards and ex-wards.  Every story has a bit of surprise on my part, and I always try to understand: is there something wrong with my thinking or is there still a sound link in my wonders? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first conclusion I made from my experience of interacting with people is certainly not a novelty.  Most people prefer to do almost nothing for little money than to work and earn a normal amount.  Moreover, not every person can admit this to himself and others, therefore he tries to invent reasons why he again and again goes in search of a better place for his employment.

      However, I am even more surprised by my second conclusion (which, perhaps, is not a novelty either).  When a certain level of wages is reached (each has his own limit; apparently, it depends on the needs of a particular person), the employee stops straining (for example, he does not go to work on weekends for an additional fee).  Here the question arises: why does the feeling of satiety come, why there is no desire to work more, to earn more?  Why are they satisfied with a salary of 30,000 rubles, if you can earn 40,000 or 50,000 rubles? <br><br>  Often, in response to such questions, I hear that there is no point in exerting ten thousand rubles or simply ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like working at weekends‚Äù.  And all this I say young healthy guys who still have no family, still have a whole life ahead and have something to strive for (go study for the law, buy a car or save for a down payment and take an apartment on credit or two or three years to sit on ‚ÄúSuck‚Äù and buy it). <br><br>  Not a single person from my wards wants to take responsibility and go to a management position with a salary twice the money they currently earn. <br><br>  To the direct question: why there is no desire, people answer - ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to strain‚Äù or ‚ÄúThis is hemorrhoids‚Äù.  Further, I do not conduct a dialogue, since it is somehow wrong to persuade to take a leadership position, but questions remain. <br><br>  I agree that an installer is a very pessimistic job, because for its good performance you need to take into account a lot of different trifles: accurate cable laying, integrity of finishing works that have already been done, the availability of all the necessary material and, of course, competent assembly system and its launch.  However, when the result is achieved, the person should have great feelings - labor pride, and the more it is, the more clearly and competently the work at the facility has been completed.  In this case, over time, the desire to perform linear work begins to fade, since it is boring and monotonous;  It is much more interesting to connect, adjust devices and various devices and immediately see the result of their activities.  It is quite logical that a person should strive to avoid linear work and engage in purely engineering activity.  However, it involves greater responsibility and elements of the organization;  it is necessary to indicate to installers how to lay the cable correctly, and analyze the whole system for errors (for example, whether this or that equipment is mixed up).  And now our employees do not want to go through this line with the name ‚Äúresponsibility‚Äù. <br><br>  I ask you not to take my note as a complaint about the difficult fate of a manager or some kind of soul cry, I‚Äôm really interested in the opinion of people who understand what I‚Äôm writing about. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/160089/">https://habr.com/ru/post/160089/</a></p>
