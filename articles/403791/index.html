  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ezviz S5 and S5 +: high-definition action cameras</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  The true companion of any traveler is a photo or video.  The more pleasant was the moment when the video camera began to fit in your pocket, and the shooting was no worse than a regular camera.  Moreover, such an action camera is not afraid of vibrations, falls and even diving to quite serious depths.  The company Ezviz, which recently entered the Russian market with a whole complex of cameras for the house, could not leave aside lovers of extreme recreation.  So, let's see how we will be pleased with the two models of action cameras Ezviz S5 and Ezviz S5 +. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/91c/5e4/6a5/91c5e46a538847aca7d7f674fd4281be.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  Let's start with the differences.  Externally, the camera is quite easy to distinguish by the red ring on the lens.  Right - Ezviz S5 +. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/a6d/45b/84a/a6d45b84a6a8412b9231846cbf616798.jpg"><br><p>  Also, the differences relate to the battery compartment cover. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/436/18e/517/43618e517d6944e4a7fdb298b527ca35.jpg"><br><p>  To understand the differences of cameras, it is better to look at the specifications.  The first, and, perhaps, the main difference is the frame rate in 4K resolution.  The Ezviz S5 model can shoot at 4K at a frequency of 15 frames per second, while the S5 + shoots full 30 frames per second with a resolution of 3840 x 2160 pixels.  The equipment is slightly different, but the main differences are visible in the table. </p><br><table><thead><tr><th></th><th>  Ezviz S5 </th><th>  Ezviz S5 + </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>  Matrix size </td><td>  1 / 2.33 " </td><td>  1 / 2.33 " </td></tr><tr><td>  The number of megapixels </td><td>  16Mp </td><td>  12Mp </td></tr><tr><td>  Lens focal length </td><td>  3 mm </td><td>  3 mm </td></tr><tr><td>  Lens aperture </td><td>  2.8 </td><td>  2.8 </td></tr><tr><td>  Lens viewing angle </td><td>  158 ¬∞ </td><td>  158 ¬∞ </td></tr><tr><td>  Maximum video resolution </td><td>  3840 x 2160 15 frames / s </td><td>  3840 x 2160 30 frames / s </td></tr><tr><td>  Image stabilizer </td><td>  there is </td><td>  there is </td></tr><tr><td>  Type of image stabilizer </td><td>  digital </td><td>  digital </td></tr><tr><td>  Video file type </td><td>  MP4 (H.264) </td><td>  MP4 (H.264) </td></tr><tr><td>  Manual white balance </td><td>  - </td><td>  there is </td></tr><tr><td>  Video shooting upside down </td><td>  - </td><td>  there is </td></tr><tr><td>  Photo Resolution </td><td>  16 Mp </td><td>  12 Mp </td></tr><tr><td>  Manual photography </td><td>  there is </td><td>  there is </td></tr><tr><td>  Serial photography </td><td>  - </td><td>  3/5/10/30 fps </td></tr><tr><td>  Automatic interval photography </td><td>  - </td><td>  1/3/5/10/30/60/120/300 </td></tr><tr><td>  Built-in display </td><td>  there is </td><td>  there is </td></tr><tr><td>  Touchscreen </td><td>  there is </td><td>  there is </td></tr><tr><td>  Built-in display resolution </td><td>  320 x 240 dots LCD </td><td>  480x320 IPS dots </td></tr><tr><td>  Sound recording </td><td>  there is </td><td>  there is </td></tr><tr><td>  Number of built-in microphones </td><td>  2 </td><td>  2 </td></tr><tr><td>  Audio file type </td><td>  AAC </td><td>  AAC </td></tr><tr><td>  Memory card support </td><td>  micro SD </td><td>  micro SD </td></tr><tr><td>  Recommended Memory Card Class </td><td>  Grade 10 and up </td><td>  Grade 10 and up </td></tr><tr><td>  Maximum memory card capacity </td><td>  128 GB </td><td>  128 GB </td></tr><tr><td>  USB connector type </td><td>  microUSB </td><td>  microUSB </td></tr><tr><td>  Type of HDMI connector </td><td>  microHDMI </td><td>  microHDMI </td></tr><tr><td>  Wi-Fi </td><td>  2.4 GHz </td><td>  2.4 GHz, 5 GHz </td></tr><tr><td>  USB version </td><td>  v2.0 </td><td>  v3.0 </td></tr><tr><td>  Wireless remote control support </td><td>  there is </td><td>  there is </td></tr><tr><td>  Type of batteries </td><td>  Li-Ion battery </td><td>  Li-Ion battery </td></tr><tr><td>  Battery capacity </td><td>  1160 mAh </td><td>  1200 mAh </td></tr><tr><td>  Case Type Included </td><td>  box for underwater photography (up to 40 meters) </td><td>  box for underwater photography (up to 40 meters) </td></tr><tr><td>  Dimensions (WxHxD) </td><td>  58 x 45 x 21 mm </td><td>  58 x 45 x 20.6 mm </td></tr><tr><td>  Weight (without battery) </td><td>  99 g </td><td>  99.7 g </td></tr></tbody></table><br><p>  <strong>Getting to compare</strong> <br>  Naturally, it is quite interesting to compare the Ezviz action cameras with their direct competitors from GoPro. <br>  For the top-end camera Ezviz S5 + it would be logical to oppose GoPro Hero 4 Black.  To simplify the perception, I will insert a comparison table. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/dff/39c/664/dff39c664066472a83e328c6da6f2a27.JPG"><br><p>  Besides the fact that a newer chip is used, the characteristics of which I will discuss later, it is necessary to note the presence of distortion correction and more battery life in the 4K resolution mode.  But action cameras, like smartphones, have a major disease: short battery life.  Therefore, you have to either carry a few batteries, or a charger.  And if the change of batteries on the ski slope is still somehow possible, then a diver who has gone under the water for 1.5-2 hours doesn‚Äôt have to change the battery, the device that will work longer will definitely win. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/022/496/6a6/0224966a6a294f289e1c178341acc511.JPG"><br><p>  The Ambarella A9SE chip is slightly different from its predecessor.  Smaller technical process has a positive impact on energy efficiency, and also added a noise reduction function, designed to improve the final video. </p><br><p>  As for the younger model in the lineup, the camera Ezviz S5 is opposed to GoPro Hero 4 Silver. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/47c/5ad/a4f/47c5ada4f7824fe88f52e0f4350fe3e7.JPG"><br><p>  Immediately striking that the camera Ezviz 5S has a higher resolution matrix.  The battery comes with several smaller capacity.  It is worth saying that the battery from the Ezviz S5 + camera is suitable for the younger model, but it is difficult to insert it, since the space for it is allocated a little less. </p><br><p>  All Ezviz action cameras use aspherical lenses.  Briefly I will give the features and differences of spherical and aspherical lenses: </p><br><ul><li>  spherical lens has a different shape and structure; </li><li>  a lens with a spherical shape is distinguished by a geometric type of rotation; </li><li>  an aspherical lens is shaped like a parabola or ellipse.  It is this form that further enhances the transmission capacity of the light rays and the possibilities of the lens; </li><li>  in an aspherical lens, the curvature of the surface changes with distance from the highest point, this helps to significantly reduce and correct the aberrations that occur when using conventional spherical lenses with high dioptries; </li><li>  a change in the geometry of an aspherical lens increases the radius of view (its zone). </li></ul><br><p>  For clarity, we give a comparison of aspherical and spherical lenses: <br><img src="https://ritaspark.ru/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/i-2.jpg" alt="image"></p><br><p>  And with the application of image correction at the stage of video compression, we get a better picture. </p><br><p>  Separately, it is worth noting the presence of two microphones, which are designed to reduce parasitic noise.  This technology is familiar to users of active noise-canceling headphones, when third-party monotonous sounds begin to be programmatically ejected from the sound path.  In practice, it looks like a muffled sound of the engine, although a sudden knock or shot will be heard normally.  Especially to assess the performance of this technology, at the end of the article will be added a video of the flight of the aircraft with engine noise, and everyone will be able to personally evaluate the operation of noise reduction. </p><br><p>  <strong>Detailed inspection</strong> </p><br><p>  Let's start with an external inspection.  The camera comes in a translucent tube. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/219/d2a/aa0/219d2aaa068942d3be8ff503a20bcc3e.jpg"><br><p>  In the upper part, the camera itself is mounted in a waterproof box.  And in the bottom - the instruction with all the equipment.  We will consider the bundling version of Ezviz S5 +. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/4ee/fbe/df3/4eefbedf3e7a4f0b82a584d7c8469d83.jpg"><br><p>  The kit includes: a pair of velcro mounts, a kit for attaching the camera to the quadcopter hanger, a mount adapter, a spare aquabox door, a removable part for attaching to the velcro, a cap for an aquabox lens, a cap for a camera lens, a battery. </p><br><p> The manufacturer claims that aquabox can withstand depths of up to 40 meters.  So far, no such test has been conducted, but the opening of the diving season is nearing and it will be possible to check for sure.  For now we will examine boxing from all directions.  It is equipped with a standard mount and has three buttons.  What is nice, on and off is displayed on a separate button.  She also switches camera modes. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/0a8/28d/f1c/0a828df1c5564e6da9242454c3b3bbf3.jpg"><br><p>  It's time to get acquainted with the device.  On the right side are two large buttons.  They are also available in the aquabox: the power button and the settings menu.  With a long press of the settings button, the Wi-Fi access point is turned on and you can connect to it from your smartphone. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/c65/a92/dfc/c65a92dfc3b547f386224ecd084f3a70.jpg"><br><p>  At the top there is a button for recording and speaker.  If you wish, you can watch and listen to the recording, although it is more convenient to do this, of course, on a computer screen. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/4c8/3c0/9fe/4c83c09fe71d4580ac99121ea34302d3.jpg"><br><p>  On the left, under the plug, there are microSD, miniHDMI connectors and a microSD card slot.  Maps up to 128 GB are supported, which should be enough for 5.5 hours of video at a maximum resolution of 4K. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/5aa/273/42c/5aa27342c7ca4a92b47726867cf2ee64.jpg"><br><p>  We should also mention the choice of a memory card for shooting in an action camera.  Since at a resolution of 4K the flow rate is critical, and the operating conditions can be very diverse, special attention should be paid to the choice of a microSD card.  For example, Transcend introduced the cards with support for Ultimate UHS-I U3M Video Speed ‚Äã‚ÄãClass 30 (V30).  The card supports the minimum speed for sequential recording at 30 MB / s and fully meets all the media requirements for devices recording video with 4K Ultra HD resolution.  The maximum read and write speeds for them reach 95 MB / s.  Additionally, Transcend microSD Ultimate UHS V30 memory cards demonstrate the maximum level of performance even in the most severe operating conditions.  They are not only capable of operating at extreme temperatures from -25 ¬∞ C to 85 ¬∞ C, but also have a waterproof case, are shock resistant, and are protected from static electricity and X-rays.  In addition, the built-in support for the ECC algorithm allows you to automatically correct errors that occur during data transfer. </p><br><p>  While the camera is running, the display automatically turns off to save power.  This significantly saves battery power, but is not very convenient when holding the camera in front of you and using the screen as a viewfinder. </p><br><p>  Separately, it is worth going through the menu.  Since there are a lot of pictures, it is worth hiding them in the spoiler.  The touch screen makes it easy to customize all settings.  And when using aquabox just select the desired mode of operation and shoot. </p><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Camera menu</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><p>  Icon menu: </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/0c5/b99/ad2/0c5b99ad2ce744bdabc601c305d75a3d.jpg"><br><p>  Camera Status: </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e8d/340/fd4/e8d340fd4b924356ab62c892e9ee4f05.jpg"><br><p>  Camera Info: </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/269/fa1/9d8/269fa19d82ae4b709330001ca8ba5478.jpg"><br><p>  Wireless controls: </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/50b/86e/ff2/50b86eff2082470eb0ff8bb8bad852f7.jpg"><br><p>  Misc Settings: </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/3e7/597/40a/3e759740adb84a048da8c2bc984fd0ce.jpg"><br><p>  Setup: </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/ffd/e53/f64/ffde53f6411b4c53bceed103c53486a0.jpg"><br><p>  Video Settings: </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/ad9/10e/646/ad910e646fd34dba887599768eea6e22.jpg"></div></div><br><p>  It should be noted that the camera can record video with a frequency of 30 frames (4K resolution) to 240 frames per second (720p).  The video shows the difference when playing. </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1r7xE9Kvb_E" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  Since the stated shooting angle is very wide, 158 degrees, it is impossible to avoid distortion in the corners.  You can clearly see this when shooting close objects. </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IXkeQZ5lNnE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  It was difficult to get past the filming under water.  Since the beach season was not yet open, it was decided to test the camera in the pool. </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KBYa6AnYh6s" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  To assess the noise reduction, the camera was fixed at the level of the wheel of a light single-engine aircraft.  You can admire the picture in 4K and evaluate the noise level. </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/URka0elNPEE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  <strong>Total</strong> <br>  We are seeing an entry into the market of an excellent camera that can compete with eminent cameras from GoPro, and in some respects it is significantly ahead of the competitor.  Moreover, it is possible to choose a camera with suitable characteristics and price.  Compatibility with GoPro peripherals and mounts makes it easy to find mounts and various accessories.  Well, the quality of shooting and the impression of viewing your adventures at home, in a comfortable chair, will not leave anyone indifferent. <br>  Cameras can be purchased at all popular retailers.
