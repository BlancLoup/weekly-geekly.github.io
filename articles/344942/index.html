If you came to this page of your own will and intention, then keep in mind that this is an abbreviated, slightly more modern version of Eric Raymond's article ‚ÄúA <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">smart way to ask questions</a> ‚Äù - an excellent, but long text. <br><br>  On the other hand, if someone else sent you to this page and you want to quickly understand what is happening here, then read on.

    <h2>  How to ask questions </h2><br>  In short: <br><br><ul><li>  Do not ask permission </li><li>  Tell us the details </li><li>  Ask relevant questions </li><li>  Be polite </li><li>  Wait </li></ul><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In this article, the participants in the conversation are Terry and Gonad (in honor of the hypothetical igrodels from the <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/130-Alone-in-the-Dark">No Punctuation Marks</a> series of comic reviews of the games).  Terry will always be a helper on Spiffy's IRC channel, and Gonad will be the one asking for help (ineptly). <br><br><h4>  1 - Do not ask permission </h4><br>  This is annoying to many.  On a number of channels, special bots work, which give a whole tirade that there is no need to ask permission.  So let's deal with it first. <br><br><blockquote>  [16:00] * Gonad joined the # spiffy-help channel <br>  [16:00] * Theme: ‚ÄúWelcome to the spiffy help channel.  Latest version 1.5 <br>  [16:00] &lt;Gonad&gt; Can you ask a question about Spiffy? <br>  [16:01] * Terry sobbed softly in the corner. </blockquote><br>  Let's look first at the most obvious.  The whole channel is dedicated to help with working with Spiffy, it is indicated in the name of the channel and in the subject.  Do you think that someone harbored anger personally to you - and therefore will not respond?  (malice may appear later, but for now everything is fine).  <b>Of course, they will help you</b> .  Just ask the question immediately. <br><br>  What Gonad should have said: <br><br><blockquote>  [16:00] * Gonad joined the # spiffy-help channel <br>  [16:00] * Theme: ‚ÄúWelcome to the spiffy help channel.  Latest version 1.5 <br>  [16:00] &lt;Gonad&gt; Hello, I have a problem with ... </blockquote><br>  Which immediately brings us to the next topic. <br><br><h4>  2 - Tell us the details </h4><br>  Let's continue the proposal of Gonad from the previous paragraph. <br><br><blockquote>  [16:00] * Gonad joined the # spiffy-help channel <br>  [16:00] * Theme: ‚ÄúWelcome to the spiffy help channel.  Latest version 1.5 <br>  [16:00] &lt;Gonad&gt; Hello everyone, my Spiffy gives an error page, what's the matter? <br>  [16:03] &lt;Terry&gt; Wait a second, I'll establish a telepathic connection with your brain and find out what you are talking about.  I warn you, this can lead to loss of control over motor functions. </blockquote><br>  Moral of the story: "Helpers are not telepaths."  When you report a problem, they need some details to move on.  Preferably some or all of the following: <br><br><ul><li>  Error page (or issue). </li><li>  The order of actions that led to this page and what was expected instead. </li><li>  Software version with all installed plugins.  If you think that it matters, specify the version of the OS and database, if it is used. </li></ul><br>  Note regarding the publication of the page with an error or issue.  Such things are usually of giant size, so if you directly publish them on the channel, you will look like a clown at a funeral.  Instead, post the full text on sites specifically designed for this, such as <a href="http://pastie.org/">Pastie</a> , <a href="http://pastebin.com/">Pastebin</a> or <a href="http://gist.github.com/">Gist</a> , and then publish the URL on the channel.  These sites also support very useful syntax highlighting. <br><br>  If the problem is complex or the description of the steps requires a long description, then publish a brief summary in IRC, and a more detailed description in the text by reference. <br><br>  So again, let's see what Gonad should have done. <br><br><blockquote>  [16:00] * Gonad joined the # spiffy-help channel <br>  [16:00] * Theme: ‚ÄúWelcome to the spiffy help channel.  Latest version 1.5 <br>  [16:00] &lt;Gonad&gt; Hello everyone, I have an error page in the new version of Spiffy 1.5, when I try to create a second admin.  Steps and details here: <a href="http://pastie.org/417957">pastie.org/417957</a> <br>  [16:02] &lt;Terry&gt; Wow, how well issued a request for help, I run, I RUN for your help. </blockquote><br>  And everyone will live happily ever after. <br><br><h4>  3 - Ask relevant questions </h4><br>  I hang out on several programming channels and constantly here and there we see questions of this type: <br><br><blockquote>  [16:00] * Gonad joined the #programming channel <br>  [16:00] * Theme: "Welcome to the new channel #programming" <br>  [16:02] &lt;Gonad&gt; Hi guys, how to create a search engine / forum / application to simulate the hydrodynamics of a fusion reactor cooling circuit <br>  [16:07] &lt;Terry&gt; Just by asking such a question you showed your own helplessness, and now I have to ignore you until the thermal death of the Universe. </blockquote><br>  Take the equivalent of the real world.  In your town there is a local club of heavy-bodied, covered with lube, who love to tinker with car engines: tune them, fix them, and so on.  They meet every evening.  Now imagine that someone comes into their workshop and asks: ‚ÄúHey, guys, I want to design and build an engine, can you briefly explain how to do this?  I have a notebook and all that. ‚Äù <br><br>  Rejoice that at least you have some kind of anonymity online - and you are protected from immediate physical violence. <br><br>  We have a help channel, which usually involves answers to technical questions.  Sometimes non-technical questions come in, but do not ask anything that requires full business / technical specifications or a four-year education course to answer. <br><br>  On this topic, you can read the site <a href="http://www.slash7.com/pages/vampires">Help Vampire</a> (which is very funny and better illustrated than this article).  Be sure not to be such a character. <br><br><h4>  4 - Be polite </h4><br>  Common sense says that if you are in the position of a person who depends on the kindness of strangers, then you are supposed to be polite to them. <br><br>  Remember how much you paid for the contract to support your software?  Exactly.  99.99% chat helpers help for free.  These are volunteers and usually nice people who do their job because they have some kind of pleasant feeling by helping others.  Similar to an idiot, you really discourage them from continuing their noble efforts. <br><br>  Examples of bad behavior: <br><br><ul><li>  Arrogance. </li><li>  Refusal / ignoring the answers, because they do not instantly solve the problem or require you to use a little bit of the brain. </li><li>  Lack of your own thoughts and the expectation that you will be fed with a spoon.  (Do not google your problem before asking a question - a typical example). </li></ul><br><h4>  5 - Wait </h4><br>  This is the Internet, there are many time zones.  Therefore, questions are not necessarily answered instantly.  Look again at Gonad. <br><br><blockquote>  [16:00] * Gonad joined the # spiffy-help channel <br>  [16:00] * Theme: ‚ÄúWelcome to the spiffy help channel.  Latest version 1.5 <br>  [16:00] &lt;Gonad&gt; Hi, guys, in what Spiffy configuration setting does email support include? <br>  [16:01] &lt;Gonad&gt; Anyone? <br>  [16:04] &lt;Gonad&gt; Hello? <br>  [16:09] &lt;Gonad&gt; Great, don't talk to me <br>  [16:10] * Gonad left # spiffy-help channel <br>  [16:11] &lt;Terry&gt; Hello everyone, inventing a cure for cancer, now back - does anyone need help? </blockquote><br>  Sometimes answers come in a few hours or days on relatively quiet channels, so ask a question and wait.  Most people will indicate your nickname when they answer, so make sure that the IRC client is set to alert when your nickname is mentioned. <br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  If you are here and really read everything, then congratulations.  Now you know enough not to be an idiot and not be ignored by asking any question in IRC.  But this is only the first step;  I still recommend Eric Raymond's article ‚ÄúA <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">smart way to ask questions</a> ‚Äù for a more complete explanation of all the details ... let's not be content with what we have ‚Äî and get a full disclosure of the topic. <br><br><h4>  Real world examples </h4><br>  Time for a fun contest.  Can you tell what rules are violated in the following examples from the real world?  (Names are changed to protect ... innocent). <br><br><blockquote>  #passenger on irc.freenode.net <br>  [21:58] &lt;Gonad&gt; what is wrong with this garbage? <br>  [21:58] &lt;Gonad&gt; *** Exception Errno :: EPIPE in Passenger RequestHandler (broken pipeline) </blockquote><blockquote>  # kubuntu-offtopic on irc.freenode.net <br>  [03:55]&gt; Gonad has joined this channel (***). <br>  [03:55] &lt;Gonad&gt; hi ... pls, how to download and extract music from youtube? <br>  [03:58]&gt; Gonad left the channel. <br>  [04:02] &lt;Terry&gt; Hmm.  Tactics asked, run away. </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/344942/">https://habr.com/ru/post/344942/</a></p>
