He shook off the dust from his resume and ... found nothing new - a hundred monotonous vacancies with abstract requirements: ‚Äúexcellent knowledge of <acronym>PHP</acronym> and MySQL‚Äù. <br><br>  I had to load the mail server and walk through interviews.  In general, I would prefer to send a resume only once and only to one company, but this time it did not work out. <br><br>  Below, how to write the text of the job for the programmer. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      <br>
      For me, the perfect job text is one that allows you to answer all my questions: <br><ol><li>  <b>What kind of company and what does it do?</b> <br><br>  This is the first step in the quest to solve what you have to do.  It is good if the website of the company is specified or it can be pulled out from an email.  Sometimes, there are vacancies from the ‚ÄúLarge Holding‚Äù with soap on mail.ru.  Usually they do not differ originality and do not receive attention. <br>  It is very good if the company is public, and it is already possible to form an opinion. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Why do you need a programmer?</b> <br><br>  Here it is already more specific - what tasks need to be solved.  What projects does the company work on? <br>  Yes, I want to know what I will do before I have an interview.  And I do not want to waste my time.  I know perfectly well what I want and what I do not want, and I do not care about what I will do for the next <nobr>year or two</nobr> .  The question is, why should I send a resume, if by ‚Äúsupporting existing and developing new <nobr>Internet projects</nobr> ‚Äù is meant to stretch the templates on the CMS? <br>  My favorite: <br><blockquote>  Responsibilities: Development of programs that provide the ability to perform the tasks by means of computer technology. " </blockquote><br></li><li>  <b>Requirements.</b>  <b>What kind of person do you need?</b> <br><br>  With enviable consistency, starting from a small <nobr>online store</nobr> , ending with a serious <nobr>IT-company</nobr> , everyone needs "excellent knowledge of <acronym>PHP</acronym> and MySQL."  But everyone puts in a different meaning.  <nobr>Someone just</nobr> needs to write a simple function and merge the tables in the query, and <nobr>someone</nobr> checks the knowledge of certain subtleties. <br>  I especially like the "knowledge of the PLO."  For <nobr>some reason</nobr> , I always mean design patterns and principles of <nobr>object-oriented</nobr> design, and, for a company, append TDD.  And at the interview I learn that it is enough to know the difference between the abstract class and the interface. <br>  I, of course, understand that everything should be clarified at the interview.  But, one wonders, why waste time again?  I'd rather write in the summary what I can and what not, and then look how far I fit you and whether we should meet.  I have no reason to lie. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Which team?</b>  <b>What technologies are used in the process?</b> <br><br>  Yes, I care about who I will work with and how.  I still know it at the interview.  So maybe not bring it to him? <br><br></li><li>  <b>Working conditions.</b> <br><br>  There is nothing special here.  Usually this item is tried to be described in sufficient detail. <br><br></li></ol>  Still, they have to themselves at least <nobr>somehow</nobr> "non-standard" texts of vacancies.  You understand that people are looking for a person, not a function. <br><br>  <b>A few words about the interview:</b> <br><ul><li>  I am very grateful when, after the interview, they can directly tell me that I am not fit.  If the vacancy did not work, then at least do not make me wait. <br><br></li><li>  Of course, I understand that I am not the first and not the last.  And that your head is already spinning from constant meetings.  But it will take 3 minutes to print a resume, if you have not already done so, and quickly glance over.  No one rushes you.  I, frankly, unpleasantly retell the facts from my resume.  I then generally cease to understand why I came. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>At last</b> <br><blockquote>  If you think about it, you will see that the perfect ad will attract one person, and that one who is needed.  ... <br><br>  ‚ÄúAn acrobat is required, which can pass along a wire at a height of 200 m above a raging flame.  You will have to go twice a day, on Saturdays - three times.  Fee - 25 pounds a week.  No pensions, no compensation for injury.  Appear personally to the circus "Wild Cat" from 9 to 10 ". <br><br>  Perhaps the syllable is not very good, but the goal is clear: you need to balance the risk of monetary gain so that more than one applicant does not appear.  About the little things here do not have to ask.  Those who are not very clever on the wire, the ad will not attract.  There is no need to indicate that the applicant should be healthy, non-drinker and not prone to dizziness.  It will understand without words.  There is no need to say that people suffering from high altitude fear are not suitable.  They will not come anyway.  The art here is that the board matches the danger.  1000 pounds a week can lure ten people, 15 pounds will not lure anyone.  <nobr>Somewhere in the</nobr> middle - the right amount, which will attract someone who suits.  If two come, it means that we overestimated the figure. <br><br>  <i>Cyril Parkinson.</i>  <i>"The Laws of Parkinson"</i> <br></blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285286/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285286/</a></p>
