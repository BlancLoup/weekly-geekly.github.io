  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Toastmaster</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h3>  Toastmaster </h3>  Have you ever prepared a wedding?  The process, I tell you, is not pleasant.  Need to take into account a thousand little things.  Who will help us in this?  Mother-in-law?  No, of course, we will help the faithful friend of the computer.  Only for this you first need to write a program.  Therefore, I offer my idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa startup, ‚ÄúMyself Tamada‚Äù. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><h3>  Wedding </h3>  Wedding.  The wedding never changes.  First of all, it is rituals.  The given algorithm.  Redemption, registry office, skating, bride abduction, etc.  must be.  And since all this is, then there are ready-made scripts.  In principle, even now you can find everything you need on the Internet.  But for what pieces you have to assemble in order to compile something more or less worthy, you would know ... <br><br><h3>  Archives </h3>  Therefore, one of the most important components of the site for the preparation of the wedding - scripts archives.  Where clearly and by roles all action is registered.  It will be the most useful thing.  Contests, poems, speeches.  In addition, the archives of any posters that are needed for decoration will be useful (for download, to print yourself and where to buy links).  Archives of congratulations, toasts.  Generally speaking, everyone is sickly.  I remember that weak improvisation that I gave out at my brother's wedding, when, unexpectedly for me, the toastmaster called me to say a popular toast.  This is a mess, all improvisations must be prepared.

      Be sure to archive the FAQ, which lists the most common mistakes of the wedding organizers.  For example, there is not enough bread, napkins, alcohol, etc.  In general, there should be a haven of experience, so that after reading the mistakes, people can make a wedding that is close to the ideal.  By the way, I know one piece of advice.  Do not arrange your wedding in the winter! <br><br><h3>  Dvanol </h3>  Content from users should also take place.  First of all, these are recommendations, recommendations, recommendations.  Places of skiing, venues, photographers, operators, etc.  Plus, videos and photos from weddings users of the service.  Guest reviews from weddings.  Its variants of scenarios. <br><br><h3>  2008, already bears in presidents, it is necessary to add a technical </h3>  From technical it is possible to offer a form for planning how to seat guests.  There should be a nice interface where you can choose the number of tables, places, their size, location.  In general, quickly and beautifully make the scheme, which can be printed. <br><br>  Another interface (for example, integrated with <a href="http://last.fm/" title="Without comments, if you are not yet using, much is lost">last.fm</a> to select music. Listen, create a playlist. Music is very important, you can‚Äôt overlook it. <br><br>  By the way, do not forget that the site must support OpenID, all objects (articles, photos, ads etc) to keep tags, all geographic locations have links to Google Earth.  Tightening the bulletin board to the site will also be useful.  Wedding dresses, car decorations, cakes (often not eaten), etc. will be there to exchange, buy and sell. <br><br><h3>  Startup payback </h3>  Of course, advertising.  And you can advertise a lot of things. <br><br><ul><li>  Guest Accommodation - Hotels </li><li>  Food and Drinks - Wholesale orders stores, places where food is prepared </li><li>  Photographs and video filming - professional photographers and cameramen </li><li>  The first dance of the newlyweds is a dance school, or instructors for the preparation of a normal dance, and not a dull <s>city.</s> Wiggling, as is often the case </li><li>  Flowers - bulk order of flowers </li><li>  Balls - Bulbs Bulk Order </li><li>  Catania - where to book a limousine, gazelles for guests, etc. </li><li>  Toasts, DJs, animators - organizations supplying them </li><li>  Contraceptives - although this is after the wedding ... if not too late ... </li><li>  Live musicians would not be superfluous either. </li></ul><br>  In addition, it is reasonable to take a certain fee for access to the archive.  But this is for the most greedy.  Information must be free! <br><br>  The thing is, in my opinion, very useful.  Wedding happens with almost everyone, and some more than once.  And we want to do good in the name of the moon?  So do not be greedy.  People will say thank you, karma will increase.  Advertising can be limited.  Here is a paid cleaning advertising for the bourgeoisie can be organized.  Normal people should use advertisements. <br><br><h3>  And what should be the wedding? </h3>  The wedding should be fun.  First of all, for the newlyweds.  I went to three weddings.  And I made out for myself one thing - the way it is happening right now I do not like it terribly.  Therefore, there should be scripts on the site for non-standard trash weddings.  At such a wedding, there will be no old people and children, but only advanced <s>and pushed</s> young people.  In my head a couple of good scenarios lie.  Ah, the wedding, the wedding, the wedding ... Perhaps when I come in handy, it is unlikely that there is that weak half who would agree to this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/966/f10/c05/966f10c052e40876746160044e60c892.jpg" title="Family archive.  1971" alt="Family archive.  1971"><br>  Wuzzup !!! <br><br><h3>  Post postum </h3>  I have stated only the most simple thoughts.  I'm not so adept at weddings.  It would be nice to get advice from experienced people who often held weddings to make everything beautiful.  And of course you should not be limited to what is offered.  You can come up with a lot of interesting things.  For example, Wizard (master, as when installing programs), which will lead the visitor through all stages of the wedding, with the ability to create your own script from the proposed options for each action (with annoying ads, of course). <br><hr><br>  In my lj <a href="http://akeepaki.livejournal.com/230526.html" title="Toastmaster in AkiLJ">the same text, but with pictures</a> . <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/21476/">https://habr.com/ru/post/21476/</a></p>
