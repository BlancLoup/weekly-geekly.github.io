However, for the ‚Äúsmallest‚Äù small business representatives, the purchase and installation of a CRM system may require a lot of time and money. <br><br>  However, with the development of business, the need for a centralized customer relationship management system is growing.  Keeping a complete record of customer requests becomes more complex as volumes increase;  Lack of space to store all the information, data about potential customers, business contacts and possible items of income leads to inevitable financial losses.

Too good to be true, right?  Fortunately for a small business, it is 100% real and 100 percent free forever. <br><br><h3>  What do users say </h3><br>  HubSpot CRM is the most popular system in this list, more than 500 reviews from small business users.

Awesome opportunity to create / edit your own sales channel.  I can not mention the contacts.  Just enter some basic information about potential customers, as Hubspot will find additional contact information for customers. ‚Äù- Max JJ review <br><br><h2>  2. FRESHSALES </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/37/jv/vq/37jvvq8ih-vninl4oeb81sqyhhs.png"><br><br><h3>  Free version </h3><br>  This version of Freshsales CRM has excellent small business opportunities for managing customers, contacts and sales.  There is integration with Zapier (data), Freshdesk (ticket service for customer support), Mailchimp (email marketing) and Google Apps.  All this helps to tie together all parts of your business.  The free Freshsales platform gives access to 10 users, making it a good choice for a growing team. <br><br><h3>  What do users say </h3><br>  Freshsales is one of the top-rated CRM systems with a 94% rating for ease of installation (average 82%), for quality support (average 85%) and ease of doing business (average 87%).  Based on the responses of users, it can be said that Freshsales is moving in the right direction with a 97% rating (compared to an average of 83%).  Wow! <br><br><h3>  Best review </h3><br>  ‚ÄúFreshsales is characterized by flexibility in setting up processes and integrations.  Everything, including phone calls, emails and automation as a whole, is connected to one interface, which is very easy to maintain and manage, and also easily accessible from anywhere in the world where there is an Internet and browser.  As for integration with other products, such major services as Google Calendar (for corporate planning), MailChimp (for e-mail campaigns) and his fellow Freshdesk (for customer support and collecting customer service) are a reliable choice. ‚Äù  - Jose Q review <br><br><h2>  3. WORKBOOKS.COM </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/d6/io/u6/d6iou6dyj0p_ypnqfg8int1clxc.png"><br><br><h3>  Free version </h3><br>  Workbooks.com integrates sales, marketing and customer service teams into one, and all for free!

Workbooks.com, however, has a great user interface.  The system is designed to resemble Windows, including the desktop and the start menu.  She is very intuitive and familiar.  The most frequently used tools can be stored on the desktop, and the rest is thought out organized in the start menu.  Thanks to this, you can always quickly find everything you want in one click.  And unlike other systems, there is no risk to cope here. ‚Äù- Madhu S. recall <br><br><h2>  4. ZOHO CRM </h2><br>  <i>approx.</i>  <i>This is the old interface from the original article.</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pd/sm/yy/pdsmyycdhhohghguarb-rh3w48w.gif"><br>  <i>new interface ZOHO CRM</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ns/hc/fq/nshcfqio5ca2sp-p7d1lidgbogm.png"><br><br><h3>  Free version </h3><br>  Zoho's name is widely known in the small business world, and their free CRM platform is a good option for start-ups, medium and small businesses.

The ability to have such a functional platform at such a low price (compared to most other CRM platforms on the market) is a huge advantage. ‚Äù- Matt M. recall <br><br><h2>  5. REALLY SIMPLE SYSTEMS </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yr/37/bb/yr37bbfp4hehkg5zhcq0wdnttay.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  Free version </h3><br>  The free offer from Really Simple Systems is designed for small businesses and aims to simplify use and provide all the necessary tools to spin up your sales at top speed.

First of all, I liked the interface, the layout of the screens and the presentation of data.  This corresponds to how I want to track the sales opportunities of my products, while the interface is not cluttered.  In the end, I don‚Äôt need much - I want to track my business development work, receive reminders about each next potential client and be able to see the whole picture of my opportunities.  Very well done. ‚Äù- Kurt O review <br><br><h2>  6. INSIGHTLY </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5g/wg/iz/5gwgizu_0grfl1snibr4sw6um4u.png"><br><br><h3>  Free version </h3><br>  The free version of the CRM platform allows you to connect up to two users and has thoughtful contact management tools to establish and develop customer relationships.

Among other advantages of this platform, users mention the online interface, speed and quality of customer support. <br><br><h3>  Best review </h3><br>  ‚ÄúFree platform.  Ongoing developer support.  I was pleased to communicate with the customer representative.  Previously, this service was not available for ‚Äúfree users‚Äù.  This is amazing.  It turned out this amazing product produces a small company.  The platform has great functionality. ‚Äù- Daniel S. recall <br><br><h2>  7. APPTIVO </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0h/gr/i-/0hgri-eq_rgsxrrtbqw1zlg3fyk.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  Free version </h3><br>  Apptivo is a truly universal solution, offering basic tools such as reporting, advanced search and saving views that are really necessary compared to new features.  The free version is available to three users and provides 500 MB free storage. <br><br><h3>  What do users say </h3><br>  If you plan to download data on customers, then Apptivo may not be the best choice, but in general, users like the support team and vendor.  The Rating on Support Quality (91%) and Ease of Doing Business (91%) are above the average, 85% and 87%, respectively. <br><br><h3>  Best review </h3> <br>  ‚ÄúTheir customer support is just a bailout.  On each screen, the help call button and, unlike most CRM platforms, the button opens a chat, not a Wikipedia or forum.  The operator immediately contacts you and helps to solve the problem.  When I first talked with the operator, I thought I was just lucky, but then I constantly used this service, and every time the operator was on the spot and answered my questions with knowledge and knowledge. ‚Äù- Dave G. review <br><br><h2>  8. CAPSULE CRM </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/d4/wk/3g/d4wk3ggx0kohaejod-wiyfxoh0o.png"><br><br><h3>  Free version </h3><br>  The free version gives users a complete picture of everything you know about your customers, potential customers and companies with whom you do business.

This is another reliable solution for ‚Äûthe smallest‚Äú small business representatives. <br><br><h3>  Best review </h3><br>  ‚ÄúThe user interface and customization settings provide flexibility, but also ease of installation.  I installed the platform at the same time for completely different companies, with completely different customer management processes.  The Capsule platform was easy and simple to adjust. ‚Äù- Will S. recall <br><br><h2>  9. CLOZE </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nx/xy/ro/nxxyrofvevsywybmpyuw66usitw.png"><br><br><h3>  Free version </h3><br>  The Close platform offers a complete picture of your contacts by email, social networks, etc.  She presents opportunities for managing social networks in order to filter and organize news feeds on the quality of leads. <br><br><h3>  What do users say </h3><br>  The Cloze platform is worthy of attention, at least because of the automatic contact management features and the assessment of potential sales.

ZOHO CONTACTMANAGER </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cd/xz/gh/cdxzghyys5avnmbqcohm6kp2o4k.png"><br><br><h3>  Free version </h3><br>  In fact, Zoho ContactManager is an online contact management solution that helps you organize contacts, tasks, leads and sales.

Many users note that this free version has helped them to set up their contacts and plan interaction with potential customers. <br><br><h3>  Best review </h3><br>  ‚ÄúI really like the structure of Zoho ContactManager.  It really helps, enhances my ability to do business, find new customers and interact with them.  I think this is exactly what you need if you want to succeed. ‚Äù- Erick L. review <br><br><hr><br>  The cost of the initial investment for the implementation of most CRM platforms can scare and in some cases even be too heavy for startups and small businesses.  The CRM platforms described above enable small businesses to manage their leads and contacts and not exceed a modest budget. <br><br>  All this information is provided by G2 Crowd users who have had experience using these free CRM platforms. <br><br><hr><br>  These <a href="https://roi4cio.com/produkty/%3Ftx_agiliwayroi_products%255Bcontroller%255D%3DProducts%26cHash%3D1d20d86c5cdef2fb25d70665e4a1887e">and many other CRMs are available on the ROI4CIO website</a> .  This application software falls into one category, but some functionality and business problems and problems to be solved are different.
