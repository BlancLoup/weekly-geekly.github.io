  <section class="page js-page"><h1>BitCoin = New generation email backbone</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  Small confused entry </h4><br>  I want to offer for discussion of the Habra community a sensible and interesting, in my opinion, idea.  This is a new generation of e-mail.  It's very simple: why not create some aliases associated with BitCoin wallets.  And it will be analogs of email addresses.  Or even use regular, already existing email addresses (but the transfer of messages then will not occur in the system of regular email).  You can then write a letter to a certain addressee at this address (as now via SMTP) or by the purse identifier (as a matter of fact, you can do it now, by applying a small message to the bitcoin transfer).  The bottom line is that without spending a bit (microsum) bitcoins no one can send a message.  As the first thought - this is a simple solution to the problem of spam - let them send it out, but then at least you can get compensation for it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I know that this was proposed many years ago, but, on the other hand, there was no convenient base for implementation.  Once offered to hang payment functionality to regular e-mail.  Here, as it seems to me, a more adequate approach is the world-wide payment system, it already has a mechanism for sending messages.  BitCoin is simply a wonderful and already well-established foundation for such an undertaking.  And it can be expanded to a fully functional e-mail of a new generation.  Paypal once used something similar, but then again, on the other hand, they associated their wallets with email addresses.  But this is only for the convenience of authentication and for addressing payments to such an address. <br><br><h4>  What is the essence or Email NextGen </h4><br>  What is the mechanism of what is offered?  The functionality itself can be organized on the basis of a BitCoin client, i.e., a wallet.  It is necessary to fasten to the wallet the functionality of full-fledged messaging, similar to e-mail.  And then it is enough to buy quite a few bitcoins in your wallet, associated with the new mail, and you can use this box for many years.  It turns out an analogy with ordinary letters - sending the letter we are obliged to buy and paste the stamp (or buy an envelope with a stamp).  Only these costs will go not to the postal service, only to the addressee.  There is no third party here.  For those who write less frequently, there will be no expenses in a global sense - we will spend bitcoins on our addressees, but we will also receive from them about the same number of letters and, accordingly, bitcoins.  In general, the result is parity.  But if the majority goes to this new e-mail, then spammers will have to seriously share with us their income.  As a bonus, more popularization and distribution of BitCoin.  First, the professionals will use it, then the rest will catch up.  Here, an important role will be played by reducing the volume of spam and the possibility of making money for users of such e-mail.  And here you don‚Äôt throw a million emails with fake addresses to the SMTP server, all the mail will go from point to point. <br><br>  Many will ask: how then is the anonymity of the wallet?  If you want to leave a wallet as anonymous as possible, do not attach an alias to it and do not give its details to anyone for correspondence purposes.  And in a particular case, you can use only the symbolical name of the wallet or the QR code for exchanging messages.  And for e-mail and other public purposes, open another alias wallet.  As a bonus - encryption of letters at a good level for both public and hidden addresses.  A convenient solution to the problem of privacy, which has been particularly hotly debated in recent months.

      What I propose to discuss is the mail in addition to the wallet, the mail hanging on it.  You can send and receive mail through the wallet.  Although you can make and specialized client, where the main focus on the mail.  But in any case - each sending of mail is a withdrawal of money from the wallet.  And back: no payment - the mail will simply not be accepted.  Again, this is usually mostly p2p exchange - no SMTP servers are needed.  You can make the address completely public, or with restrictions.  Fully public - and then it is published on the server (this is all automatic through the wallet), that is, an alias or even an email address is publicly matched with the QR code and the symbolic address of the wallet.  On the same server, you can also make a web for this mail by analogy with some mail.ru.  Although this is not so important - lately, applets are mainly used (and in our case, an applet is a wallet).  You can not compare anything at all, but simply use the QR code as an address.  For example, for business cards it would look like this: ‚Äúthe name is such and such, the address is such and such, the telephone is such and such, e-mail ...‚Äù and then insert the QR code as the mail address.  You can, by the way, easily add an anti-spamming instant messenger to such an applet.  Messaging in dialogue also has almost zero cost for both parties.  Of course, there are a number of technical details that need to be addressed (such as synchronizing boxes between multiple devices, etc.).  But these problems are not fundamental and solved. <br><br><h4>  Further more </h4><br>  Moreover, you can create a sort of BitCoin-browser, which will be credited to the user's wallet for displaying ads.  That is, we open a web site page in it, but the browser will pull up objects from addresses other than the address of this site only if it receives money in the wallet for this (the protocol for such relationships can be fully developed).  It's time for advertisers to pay for advertising to us, and not just to fatten corporations.  And all this in aggregate is quite a technological and financial response to the same Google and others like them, and also to government spies on all continents. <br><br>  You can go even further and present the web as a widely commercialized site, where opening pages and link transitions cost money for resource owners who want to attract more visitors.  At the same time, users get this money themselves.  You can make a catalog of such resources, willing to pay per visit.  And now you can conduct site promotion without using Google ads, and working directly with web surfers.  To identify those who try to cheat hits on such sites fraudulently, in our time will not make any special work.  And then fine, freezing or compromising a wallet in front of all other users - these are already technical details. <br><br><h4>  An important afterword </h4><br>  And the most important wish: I would like it all to be Open Source, free for use by end users and not owned by any company.  In the complete freedom of such programs, there is a guarantee of success, as in the past it was with regular e-mail. <br><br>  This is all just a sketch on canvas.  Therefore, a discussion of the above is highly appreciated.  Together you can create a full detailed picture of what we ourselves can use daily in the near future. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/196582/">https://habr.com/ru/post/196582/</a></p>
