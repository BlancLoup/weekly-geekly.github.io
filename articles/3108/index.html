  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Life Recording Experiments (Lifeblog)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Would you agree to record 24 hours a day all that you see and hear around?  Every second of life will be saved for posterity.  Or for law enforcement agencies who need testimony.  This is not such a distant future.  Lifebloogging experiments are already <a href="http://chronicle.com/free/v53/i23/23a03001.htm">underway</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This is a systematic, highly detailed recording of surrounding events using video cameras, voice recorders, GPS receivers and other gadgets (up to brain scanners).  All documents that fell into the hands, digitized and also saved. <br><br>  Scott Carlson (Scott Carlson) conducted a <a href="http://chronicle.com/free/v53/i23/23a03001.htm">private experiment</a> in the field of lifeblogging.  The very first days of the experiment showed that people around are not very approving of this case.  Perhaps the reason was Carlson‚Äôs strange appearance: there was a digital voice recorder around his neck, and a warning sign on his chest about recording.  Many citizens in public transport shied away and threw unkind glances, fellow travelers in the subway were nervous and transplanted to other places.  One woman showed a finger with the words "Look, he writes!".  The other guy told Carlson bluntly that someone would beat him.  In general, the surrounding people perceived a liveblogging ambiguous. <br><br>  After a few weeks of experiment, Scott Carlson found out that the recorded life is very different from normal.  As photons are observed, people change their normal state when recording.  They become different.  Worse, Carlson noticed that <i>he</i> behaves differently.  During the experiment, he never could forget about the included voice recorder and constantly felt like he was in front of a crowd of listeners.  He avoided politically incorrect and obscene expressions.  In the end, Scott Carlson finished the experiments and was left disappointed with the ‚Äúhigh social price‚Äù that has to be paid for this very interesting technology.

      Actually, technically there is nothing difficult in lifeblogging.  Modern technology allows you to record all day without changing batteries and storage media.  Disk space for a personal archive is also easy to find.  The problem is only in the absence of a single format for recording and storing, so that different databases can be synchronized and searched by them.  In general, the problem is in the absence of suitable software and specialized devices.  Another problem is in the psychology of people who are not ready for the onset of the future.  People are happy to keep the most pleasant moments of their lives in photographs, watch other people in reality TV shows, but for some reason they don‚Äôt want to record their entire life. <br><br>  The first problem (software and specialized gadgets) is gradually solved.  Nokia and Microsoft have been leading in this area for a long time.  Back in 1995, Gordon Bell, a developer and researcher, in conjunction with Microsoft Research began implementing the <a href="http://www.activatedesign.co.nz/MyLifeBits">MyLifeBits</a> project, in which he tried to preserve and digitize various aspects of his life (it took <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/110/head-for-detail.html">about a gigabyte per day</a> ).  In 1999, Microsoft Research released a prototype video camera <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/sendev/projects/sensecam/">SenseCam</a> , which was attached to the neck and took pictures once a minute, around the clock.  Lifeblogging began to take root in the minds of ordinary people simultaneously with the spread of mass photography, video filming, and the emergence of social services on the Internet, such as MySpace and YouTube.  In 2006, Nokia released <a href="http://www.nokia.com/lifeblog">Lifeblog 2.0</a> , which allows the mobile phone owner to easily save audio files, photos, geolocation information.  All this is copied into a single database about the life of the user, which is stored on the Internet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c3d/4f1/d78/c3d4f1d786de15b623c293c619f3c737.jpg" width="450" height="214" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  At Canadian University, Queen's University creates a video camera that starts recording as soon as a person meets someone‚Äôs gaze.  This year, many of the largest electronics manufacturers will begin selling life-blogging gadgets; clothes with built-in devices will appear on the market. <br><br>  Sooner or later we will all carry on ourselves a bunch of similar gadgets, so the recording of the surrounding reality will occur by itself.  Jim Gemmell, who heads the life blogging at Microsoft Research, says that over time we will be able to find personal information in our personal archive as easily as we now find the information on Google.  Lifeblog enthusiasts are confident that if (when) this practice becomes ubiquitous, crime will disappear, labor productivity and enjoyment of life will increase. <br><br>  In fact, the creation of personal archives on the Internet is already in full swing on the sites Flickr, MySpace, YouTube, Livejournal and the like.  More and more personal information is stored in digital form and archived in Internet databases. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/3108/">https://habr.com/ru/post/3108/</a></p>
