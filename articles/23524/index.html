An unknown manufacturer, PsyStar from Miami, USA, on April 14 announced the delivery of computers capable of running the unmodified version of Mac OS X 10.5 "Leopard". <br><br>  The first swallow is called OpenMac and assembled on the basis of components accessible to all.  The announced price is $ 399.  For four hundred, you will have a computer with an Intel Core 2 Duo E4500 (2.2GHz) processor, 2 gigabytes of DDR2 667 RAM, a motherboard with integrated Intel GMA 950 graphics, a DVD ¬± R drive with SATA interface and 20x speed, and 250 gigabyte hard drive.  All this will be assembled into the <a href="http://www.asus.com/products.aspx%3Fl1%3D7%26l2%3D37%26l3%3D95%26model%3D944%26modelmenu%3D1">Asus TM-211</a> package and, most importantly, will be able to work under Mac OS X. <a name="habracut"></a>  Additionally on OpenMac you can install a video card based on the GeForce 8600GT for $ 110 and a Firewire controller for another $ 50 upon purchase.  In principle, both can be installed by yourself. <br><br>  For comparison, the Mac mini for $ 599 will offer you a 1.83GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor, a gigabyte of RAM, an 80 gigabyte hard drive, and Firewire support in a miniature system unit.

      The emergence of OpenMac recalls the times when officially approved clones of Apple computers existed.  It was in the 90s when the company was under the control of Gil Amelio (Gil Amelio) and rapidly lost its market share.  So, until 1997, computers manufactured by Power Computing, Motorola or UMAX, which operated under the Apple System 7 and were faster, cost less than the original Macs, could be found on the market.  It should be noted only that they looked more like brothers from the numerous PC camp.  It was believed that the issuance of licenses for the production of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_clones">Mac-compatible computers</a> , this is the only way to gain a foothold in the market. <br><br>  Practice has shown that licensed clones did not help Apple, Jill Amelio was dismissed, and Steve Jobs took his place, who with the release of Mac OS 8.0 put an end to the clones that he himself called "leeches".  Time has shown that Jobs knew what he was doing. <br><br>  OpenMac is not all like clones of those times.  The first and, probably, the main difference is that PsyStar hardly coordinated its actions with Apple somehow.  Although, according to PsyStar, OpenMac installs the licensed Mac OS X operating system and provides the original installation disc for it, the company directly violates one of the conditions of the license agreement for Mac OS X, namely: " <i>You agree not to install, use or run this Apple software on any computer not approved by Apple or to help anyone else</i> . " <br><br>  There is no doubt that Apple will make maximum efforts to prevent such new products as OpenMac.  The <a href="http://www.psystar.com/">PsyStar website</a> stopped responding almost immediately after the news <a href="http://www.psystar.com/">came</a> out, "as soon as the morning coffee in the legal department of Apple was drunk <sup><a href="http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2008/04/14/company-claims-to-sell-mac-clone-for-399">¬©</a></sup> ."  However, interruptions in the work of the site may be caused by a heightened interest in the new product, which, it seems, in order to not have problems with Apple's trademarks, was renamed Open Computer on the first day. <br><br>  And before the advent of OpenMac, there were already ways to install Mac OS X on ordinary personal computers that require <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Firmware_Interface">EFI</a> modification or use of the EFI emulator.  And the company PsyStar, besides the successful attempt to get on the news pages, probably did not say anything new in installing Mac OS X on ordinary computers, because OpenMac uses the EFI emulator to install and run the operating system, and maybe they will not ship a single one OpenMac'a, although there probably would not be a shortage of those who wanted it. <br><br>  And yet, do you think: Pandora‚Äôs box is already open and Apple needs to prepare for attacking clones from a variety of noname companies from the Asia-Pacific region or will Steve Jobs again leave behind all competitors and envious ones?  Opinions vary.  Someone defends Apple‚Äôs right to exclusivity, while others think that this, like the iPhone unlocking adventures, are the first signs that Apple will not be able to dictate its terms everywhere.  What will happen next? <br><br>  <i>Based on <a href="http://www.efluxmedia.com/news_PsyStar_Sells_Mac_Clone_No_Word_from_Apple_Yet_16357.html">eFluxMedia</a> , <a href="http://blogs.pcworld.com/staffblog/archives/006792.html">PC World</a> , <a href="http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2008/04/14/company-claims-to-sell-mac-clone-for-399">Ars Technica</a> and <a href="http://www.macobserver.com/article/2008/04/14.4.shtml">Mac Observer</a> .</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/23524/">https://habr.com/ru/post/23524/</a></p>
