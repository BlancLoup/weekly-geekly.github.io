Then I knew a little more about the Web than nothing, but it was interesting to try. <br><br>  Under the impression of an inveterate C ++ programmer from the Web world, his own bikes, unusual solutions, resentment over and without.  All emotions are in spoilers, so as not to burden the article. <br><br>  I hope it will be interesting for Web developers to look at the attempts of C ++ nickname, and C ++ developers will learn something new for themselves.

The rest of the languages ‚Äã‚Äãhave lost comparisons on support, the number of articles and manuals, popularity. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">... what about garlic?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  One friend said a long time ago that "PHP is learning in a day!".  It is this lightness and has become the main factor of choice. </div></div><br>  The operating system for development was chosen by Ubuntu 14.04, the PostgreSQL database. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">... and what is not MySQL?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  My acquaintance with MySQL always quite quickly ended with a complete demolition of MySQL and the installation of anything else.  The reasons for this are more than enough: <br><ul><li>  MySQL does not support SQL well, and ignores what it does not support (for example, references to create table) </li><li>  MySQL was slow until patches from Oracle </li><li>  after patches from Oracle MySQL makes me fear like any Oracle product.  Oracle products break in my hands at the most inopportune moment.  For example, once BerkeleyDB recorded garbage in the database and did not notice this for a month, and after a month of work, the database was no longer recoverable. </li><li>  MySQL significantly benefits PostgreSQL only in the speed of creating a new connection to the database.  Not caching connections is bad form =&gt; there are almost no advantages </li></ul><br></div></div><br>  The web server was chosen nginx.  Apache features would be redundant for a fairly simple project. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">... and there were other reasons?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  It was interesting to try the new nginx tool, which is full of positive reviews. <br></div></div><br><br><h1>  First disappointment </h1><br>  Putting PHP-fpm and writing ‚ÄúHello world!‚Äù I was glad that everything was moving well, but then an article <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/213719/">about the penetration test</a> came <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/213719/">across</a> .  From the article it became clear that <b>the default PHP configuration is dangerous!</b>  After that, the day went on setting up PHP ... and in a month two more days.  There is no firm conviction that everything is alright! <br><br>  Very sad a lot of opportunities to shoot yourself in the leg in terms of security.  But PHP is a language that was originally designed to work with the Web. <br><br><h1>  Client-side tools </h1><br>  After a dubious struggle with the configuration, it was decided to take a rest and estimate how the page should look.  Informed about Bootstrap, I found a couple of page templates on it with not broken adaptive design, I chose a prettier one and began to customize it for the project. <br><br><h5>  <b>CSS</b> </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/85a/d5e/a6c/85ad5ea6c1f24ec68d7a115626d06269.jpg" align="right"><br>  Hands, coarsened from the brutal C ++, completely not suitable for working with the beautiful.  It was extremely difficult to squeeze out anything worthwhile, the hours of painstaking work went into minimal correction of the design. <br><br>  As a result, the following mechanism for working with design was developed: <br><ul><li>  change mostly only icons and pictures </li><li>  if possible, use available styles </li><li>  add color through javascript animation </li><li>  as a last resort, minimally edit the CSS, keeping the original </li></ul><br><br><h5>  <b>Bootstrap</b> </h5><br>  Bootstrap for CSS is like Boost for C ++.  It‚Äôs hard to imagine how much effort goes away if you don‚Äôt use it.  My insignificant CSS knowledge at that time was more than enough to start using it, customize it and even make a beautiful menu at the top of the page. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">... is that a perfect match for your needs?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Not really.  I wanted to hover on the menu drop-down submenu.  Bootstrap did not have the necessary functionality, but as it turned out, adding it is extremely easy: <br><br><pre><code class="css hljs"><span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">ul</span></span><span class="hljs-selector-class"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.nav</span></span> <span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">li</span></span><span class="hljs-selector-class"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.dropdown</span></span><span class="hljs-selector-pseudo"><span class="hljs-selector-pseudo">:hover</span></span> &gt; <span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">ul</span></span><span class="hljs-selector-class"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.dropdown-menu</span></span> { <span class="hljs-attribute"><span class="hljs-attribute">display</span></span>: block; } <span class="hljs-selector-class"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.navbar</span></span> <span class="hljs-selector-class"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.dropdown-menu</span></span> { <span class="hljs-attribute"><span class="hljs-attribute">margin-top</span></span>: <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0px</span></span>; }</code> </pre> <br><br>  It was just as easy to make a bigger font: <br><pre> <code class="css hljs"><span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">/* Making menue font bigger*/</span></span> <span class="hljs-selector-class"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.nav</span></span> &gt; <span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">li</span></span> &gt; <span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">a</span></span> { <span class="hljs-attribute"><span class="hljs-attribute">font-size</span></span>: <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1.1em</span></span>; }</code> </pre><br>  So I am very pleased with Bootstrap! <br></div></div><br><br><h5>  <b>jQuery</b> </h5><br>  jQuery is what javascript really should look like.  Short function names, <b>animation</b> , easy access to and iteration over elements, abstraction over browser-specific things.  Basics are understood in 15 minutes of reading the documentation. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">... did everything fit perfectly?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Upset about the lack of frequently used things: <br><ul><li>  working with cookies (setCookie, getCookie) </li><li>  a more advanced string class would be useful (startsWith, isLetter) </li></ul><br>  I had to make an auxiliary file with javascript and put my extensions in it. <br></div></div><br><br><h1>  Development </h1><br>  In the process of development, various problems and shortcomings of the selected tools and technologies began to manifest, faced with the lack of adequate implementations of basic things. <br><br><h5>  <b>Oauth</b> </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/989/14f/8db/98914f8db72847f7a2ab8e591eaf940e.jpg" align="left"><br>  The biggest problem was the authorization of users.  It was decided to use third-party services for authorization, such as VKontakte, Twitter, Facebook, Yandex, MailRu, Odnoklassniki. <br><br>  Suddenly it turned out that all known services see OAuth in their own way.  The differences are not that very significant, but due to small details the development has turned into a <b>real blood pressure</b> ! <br><ul><li>  Yandex is the only one who makes redirects with OAuth </li><li>  Classmates do not calculate checksums like everyone else </li><li>  MailRu does not even calculate checksums like Odnoklassniki </li><li>  Google finds fault with trifles (which I honestly liked) </li></ul><br><br>  At the same time, all services <b>have error messages that are absolutely not informative</b> , and debugging PHP code is a separate pleasure, which is described below.  In addition, the <b>answers from all the services come in their own format</b> , in no way similar to the formats of other services. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">... and what's wrong with Twitter?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  It's <b>absolutely wrong</b> with Twitter!  Some inadequate restrictions on the session, because of what can use it 1-2 users per day, and then, if they rarely click.  After exceeding the limits, Twitter begins to behave like a schizophrenic in the spring: <br><ul><li>  returns OK, but does not authorize </li><li>  does not return to the previous page due to constant redirects </li><li>  breaks all the logic of the site due to the fact that the <b>authorization is OK, but in fact is not OK</b> and you need to redirect ... And from the redirected page it is impossible to return because of the constant non-deactivating redirect </li></ul><br></div></div><br><br><h5>  <b>Php</b> </h5><br>  With PHP, everything is pretty good - language is like a language.  However, after C ++ it was unusual to work with an interpreted language: errors that in C ++ are at the compilation stage in PHP are only on runtime.  Realized that <b>C ++ - corrupts</b> , allowing less time to spend checking for typos. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">... something you keep back!</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  There would be a lot less errors if new variables were created using a keyword (for example <i>var</i> as in javascript, or <i>auto</i> as in C ++ 11).  Otherwise, <b>any typo in the variable name becomes a new variable</b> . <br></div></div><br><br>  In PHP, the lack of a free debugger, the lack of a free development environment. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">... because I bought and the problems were gone?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Nope  <b>I'm greedy!</b>  I remembered my youth with writing programs in notepad and debugging via <i>printf</i> . <br></div></div><br><br><h5>  <b>Slide show</b> </h5><br>  For the slideshow from the pictures used Backstretch plugin.  But I had to make a text slideshow by the very fact that I wanted to look good on small screens.  If you do through the pictures would have to do pictures for different screen resolutions, but it is a long time. <br><br>  Therefore, it was decided to place the beautiful layout of the text on Booststrap, and just hide the pieces of text and show by timer. <br><br><h5>  <b>Optimization</b> </h5><br>  A draft version of one of the pages weighed a few megabytes.  Loaded up stupor for a long time.  <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/">Pagespeed</a> came to the <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/">rescue</a> with his own tips. <br><br>  But the greatest help was provided by the site <a href="https://tinypng.com/">TinyPNG</a> , which using black magic and quantization squeezes pictures several times without loss of quality. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">... know the basics and consider yourself cool?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  At first, I thought that I had discovered trivial things.  However, after I went through a number of very well-known and popular resources with these tools, it turned out that very few people care about <a href="http%253A%252F%252Fhabrahabr.ru%252F">size</a> .  What can I say, <a href="http%253A%252F%252Fgoogle.com%252F">Google</a> itself <a href="http%253A%252F%252Fgoogle.com%252F">is</a> not as good as it could be. <br></div></div><br><br><h5>  <b>Internet Explorer - nyashka!</b> </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e56/1a4/5e8/e561a45e82a448eab0aeec8e59fce01c.jpeg" align="right">  I am absolutely serious.  Internet Explorer is great!  Of course, <b>not as a browser for the user</b> , but as a means of debugging the site.  Of course, not as a debugger or style inspector. <br><br>  Internet Explorer - displays the site with virtually no CSS extensions, it is very picky about markup and loads pages for an incredibly long time.  <b>These are all pluses</b> !  On it, you can make sure that the site is quickly displayed, that unclosed tags have not accidentally crept in to javascript.  In the end, you can see how the site looks in the worst case, and that the content is still readable. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">...Seriously?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Yes. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">... seriously seriously?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  YES. <br></div></div><br></div></div><br><br><h1>  Results </h1><br>  Inexpressible sensations from touching a new world for me.  The sensations are mostly positive, and the <a href="http://top-me.org/">result of the work</a> looks decent to my unassuming taste. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/250825/">https://habr.com/ru/post/250825/</a></p>
