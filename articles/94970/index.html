      The tasks are clear, we are looking for tools to solve it. <br><br>  Google has long annoyed my google voice with my eyes, which I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to use, and here he will just play a key role in our scheme, and our scheme is simple to disgraceful. <br><br>  Let's go point by point: <br>  <b>1. google voice</b> <br><img src="http://www.google.com/voice/resources/688809805-voice_logo_sm.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  First you need to register, nothing complicated, you just need to find an American proxy, and they send invites right away and from the heart.  If any difficulties arise, then there are already a lot of working proxies and registration guidelines on the network. <br><br>  As you know, GVoice allows you to initiate calls using a ‚Äúcustom call‚Äù scheme, that is, in the web interface you dial the number of the desired subscriber, and google voice connects both of you by sending a call to both your American number connected to google Voice and called subscriber. <br><br>  Therefore, already at the registration stage, we need to get a direct number in the US, to which google voice will call us.  Here we proceed to the second step. <br><br>  <b>2. <a href="http://www.ipkall.com/">www.ipkall.com</a></b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8c0/f72/7ae/8c0f727ae90c9816da700f6438f2ae6b.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  Again, there are many services that provide direct US numbers in the United States, both for free and for hard money.  I don‚Äôt remember who advised me to use the services of a service with a funny name - ipkall - but the service is excellent.  <sub>By the way, this is another of the mammoths that does not work without www.</sub> <br>  All we need from him is to register. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/29a/63f/de1/29a63fde1e60538500df39a1688e7078.png" alt="image"><br>  Registration is simple as boots: <br>  - account type - SIP <br>  - the zone code is absolutely arbitrary, I have 425 <br>  - SIP Phone number - here we drive in our SIP number from the provider we use.  For sipnet - this is SIP ID <br>  - SIP Proxy - appropriately proxy, for sipnet it is enough to enter sipnet.ru <br>  - enter email and password <br>  - the number of seconds before the release, too, can not be changed <br><br>  There they resent us with reds, saying that if they don‚Äôt use 30 days, they will take the room, but experience shows that this is not so.  After registering on ipkall, I successfully forgot about it, I remembered after a couple of months, nobody chose the number, but it is worth bearing in mind. <br><br>  So, we registered and received a direct number in the USA, which will automatically forward all calls to our SIP number. <br><br>  <b>3. google voice</b> <br><br>  After receiving the number in the US from ipkall, we return to the registration in google voice and honestly drive in the newly received number.  Google will call it and ask to enter a code for confirmation.  And then the call to our SIP number will be heard.  Enter the required numbers, and voila. <br><br>  We return to the google voice webcam on the settings page and see that our google voice number is now linked to the number from ipkall, which means that we now have a working solution for calls to the USA. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/812/5d2/e38/8125d2e38fb33a016e49da9a7f942df4.png" alt="image"><br><br>  But not only is it working, it‚Äôs also absolutely free.  After all, incoming calls to SIPNET are free, and google does not charge a penny for initiating calls to the United States. <br><br>  Successful calls, gentlemen. <br><br>  <b>PS: Yes, a small request, if you do not plan to call today / tomorrow, let's not frighten a little ipkall with thousands of registrations a day, you can cover raspberries.</b>  <b>Hope for understanding.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/94970/">https://habr.com/ru/post/94970/</a></p>
