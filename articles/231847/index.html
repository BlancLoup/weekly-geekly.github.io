Many of them have put an end to CI after the release of a year-old news <a href="https://ellislab.com/blog/entry/ellislab-seeking-new-owner-for-codeigniter">about finding new owners and maintainers for CodeIgniter</a> , since  EllisLab ceased to support him and threw all his strength on his paid CMS ExpressionEngine.  The rest continued to lament the fact that version 2 was released as early as January 28, 2011 (more than 3 years ago!) And has not been radically updated since. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  But development <a href="https://github.com/EllisLab/CodeIgniter">in the main repository on GitHub has</a> been going on quite a bit all this time, despite the fact that almost all the work on writing and reviewing the code and pull- <a href="https://github.com/narfbg">requests was</a> done by one person ( <a href="https://github.com/narfbg">@narfbg</a> ) on semi-enthusiasm.  Slowly but surely, the main components were updated, the bugs were corrected, and the framework continued to evolve.  The most loyal fans have long since switched to the develop branch (which they continued to call v3 as a joke).  At the same time, it is stable, once a month or two, somebody created the Issue with the question "When is release 3 versions?".  But no one could give an answer (including @narfbg), because the final feature set for the third version was not defined and, in fact, the deadline was not visible. <br><br>  And just recently, approximately after the shocking news about <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/218609/">Heatbleed</a> (in my opinion, this was the occasion), everyone started bustling and quickly inspected the Encrypt library, which is part of CodeIgniter.  A lot of shortcomings and possible holes in the encryption algorithms were revealed, which led to a complete rewriting of the library (to avoid confusion, it is now called Encryption), and with it plans were made to release a third version of the entire framework.  As a result, a huge number of changes were made both in the framework structure, configs, file naming rules, in libraries and drivers, etc., and a huge number of bugs and shortcomings were corrected (in 3.5 years!) And the documentation was significantly rewritten.  In the meantime, critical updates were rolled onto the current stable version 2, which led to the release in May 2014 of version 2.2.0.

      The final touch before the release is the <a href="https://github.com/EllisLab/CodeIgniter/issues/3073">completion of the new session storage library (Session)</a> , from which the session storage on the client will be removed in cookies (it used to be defaulted), only storage in the database, files, redis / memchached storages will be left (not done yet) .  Therefore, everyone is invited for help (who does not consider zashkvvar, of course, to write in PHP) in finishing the library and celebrating the release of the third version along with everyone (and with me too). <br><br>  But it‚Äôs still interesting to listen to the arguments for why CI is dead in the comments, thanks. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/231847/">https://habr.com/ru/post/231847/</a></p>
