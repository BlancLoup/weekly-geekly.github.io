It was necessary to have time to find out the answers to my questions as much as possible, and there were quite a few questions left from the first day and several new ones appeared.  This is what we go to at the conference!  The second day promised to reveal more deeply the main issue for many, I think, the conference issue - SALES ... <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5f2/f0b/786/5f2f0b7864fa4629b6712ff91b93a171.jpg">

      On the second day I attended more shows.  Firstly, the number of people was less than on the first day and secondly, I still wanted to hear a few speeches dedicated to sales.  Go right to the point.  I frankly loved the two performances. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/284/be1/441/284be1441446432cb4d72961e6017dc6.jpg"><br><br>  <b>First performance</b> <br><br>  The first was from the CEO of a company from Latin America.  Yes, it is from Latin America.  The speaker told us his story about the beginning of his career, he began from a junior sales position and at the beginning he didn‚Äôt have sales.  He came to work in the company and for the first 3 months simply did not understand what he needed to do and how to sell.  And so it went for almost half a year, until the boss came to him and said that it would be nice for him to go on vacation - perhaps there he will understand how to sell properly.  Go on vacation?!  And while not having a single successful sale?  But there was nowhere to go, and he went. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/857/f62/2b3/857f622b394e42c8af148f90bb383584.jpg"><br><br>  Being already on vacation for some time, an unsuccessful seller of happiness, sitting in a cafe accidentally met his eyes with a beautiful girl.  He tried to approach her.  On the way thinking: ‚ÄúI'm sales!  I'm macho!  I can do everything!".  But he did not have time to think about it, as his whole body shuddered.  Every step towards a beautiful girl became harder and harder.  The brain went through a lot of options as to where to start a conversation.  What does she say?  How will their conversation go? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/091/506/fa5/091506fa5462430b996bb051d8100cd0.jpg"><br><br>  But coming to her, he could not say anything except: <br>  - are you alright? <br>  - Yes <br>  - I'm resting here <br>  - Yes, I, too :) <br>  - My name is ‚Ä¶ <br>  And then the conversation itself somehow continued and continued. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c7a/e9b/ce8/c7ae9bce8aca48048062e836c7fd4eb5.jpg"><br><br>  At some point, our macho thought, and how, in fact, a beautiful stranger is different from the new client?  Well, it is clear what :) But still ... After returning from a vacation, its sales began to grow and after six months he became head of the sales department.  But <br>  This turned out to be only the beginning of his career, sales continued to grow and he climbed higher and higher on the career ladder. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/da0/f2c/e9d/da0f2ce9dc634e5c949474e2c8d93f50.jpg"><br><br>  After the lyrical introduction, the speaker turned to the serious part - he began to tell us his rules, how he sees sales.  But, honestly, his main message was at the very beginning.  Because the rest of the subtleties of his work - this is his charisma, experience and authority.  After his speech, we had a little talk with him and I received answers to my two questions prepared in advance.  While we were talking, I realized that he had already sold himself to me :) A guest from Latin America is a very charismatic, open and interesting person, and his gestures and facial expressions are indispensable for personal meetings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/790/a5c/e52/790a5ce52a7f4af4a20c4eee1a239280.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Second performance</b> <br><br>  Now I want to tell you about the second speech.  It was ‚Äúour man‚Äù, he went to the USA about 10-15 years ago and it was very interesting to hear how he started.  Just want to note that this is not less charismatic personality.  We, sitting in a small audience, felt like good friends and acquaintances.  And he just sold us himself! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/731/9b2/a21/7319b2a2124444289419eed73cbc2cda.jpg"><br><br>  His story, oddly enough, began quite prosaic.  Soon after the move, he needed money and he went and sold a subscription to books from house to house.  Door to door.  Yes Yes exactly.  The main difficulty in this work is to have time to gain confidence in a person who comes to the door in 15 seconds.  Only when it was possible to do this will it be possible to proceed to the next stage.  And if you open the door, then you already have up to 5 minutes to interest a person.  And then, attention, you need to close the sale.  And this is all standing at the door of an unfamiliar home and speaking to a man whom you see for the first time in your life. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7af/98b/22f/7af98b22fe4a4fbaa0952f3ee07fc091.jpg"><br><br>  The main goal is to create trust in the first minutes or even seconds of a conversation with a potential buyer.  After this story, the speaker turned to the fact that selling books going from house to house is the same thing as making sales going from the office of one company to the office of another.  After that, the speaker turned to the practical part of his speech and shared with us his 10th secrets of a good sale. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/829/6a0/df2/8296a0df28564ce2bafbfaee7400c25e.jpg"><br><br>  What surprised me was the simplicity with which the speaker communicated with the audience.  When he cited the example of a call to a client, he simply turned to one of the listeners sitting in the room and showed us an imitation of the call.  He did not know anyone of those with whom he spoke.  Yes!  It delights - this is the seller with a capital letter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a40/fab/887/a40fab88775c430b8906e0aa22c0d4ca.jpg"><br><br>  He did not have enough time and the audience refused to get up and be interrupted for a pause.  His speech was the last and the organizer offered to continue at the closing of the conference in the main hall.  All those sitting in the room quickly moved into the common room, and after the introductory words of the organizer, he finished his speech.  The whole room applauded! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5b3/fa1/b65/5b3fa1b65148480885858efef1c49aa2.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br><br>  I managed to talk, both with foreign participants, and with ours (Poland, Ukraine, Belarus).  We were pleasantly surprised by the lowly dressed CEOs with whom you could easily communicate.  And, surprisingly, they had 80 or more employees (as opposed to some ‚Äúironed outfits‚Äù with 50 employees).  Otherwise, everyone tried to share experiences, knowledge and recommendations.  There was no sense of competition.  Everyone was looking for partners and trying to make new contacts.  After all, this is the only way to face people who often hide behind info@xxx.xxx.  This is the meaning of the trip to the conference. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0c1/fc1/8c3/0c1fc18c317c47b38e957108936e591c.jpg"><br><br>  After returning from the conference, each CEO will surely introduce something new.  Ponder what they heard.  To tell employees who were not at the conference found solutions.  And, I hope that this will bring something good for everyone as well as for me.  Successes to all! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f25/307/7c6/f253077c6ec34196b3d7ea380b82a9e7.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/327998/">https://habr.com/ru/post/327998/</a></p>
