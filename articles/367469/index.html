It seems that the couple does not regret their action, because the other day a puppy was born from a surrogate mother - a clone of a pet.  Favorite boxer couple died due to a tumor in the brain. <br><br>  The cloning was undertaken by the <a href="http://en.sooam.com/index.html">Sooam Biotech Research Foundation</a> , which for a long time has been offering its services for cloning pets.  At the moment it is the only such laboratory in the world. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  According to the happy English, the birth was good, and the puppy feels great.  ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt get used to the fact that a puppy‚Äôs DNA is 100% identical to Dylan‚Äôs,‚Äù says Jaques.

      At the moment, the laboratory has cloned over 700 dogs on a commercial basis.  The technology used by the company involves the implantation of the ‚Äúsource‚Äù DNA into a ‚Äúclean‚Äù egg cell, with the genetic material removed. <br><br>  For the first time, the British heard about the company from a documentary film telling that the company provides dog cloning services for a fee (although there have been several cases of free services).  The company had previously held a contest, the winner of which had the opportunity to get a clone of her dog absolutely free.  At the same time the dog itself is still alive. <br><br>  The cloning was carried out 12 days after the selection of genetic material from Dylan, a pair of boxers.  Soon another puppy should be born - a clone of a dead dog. <br><br>  <b>Key Dates</b> <br><br><ul><li>  June 11.  The couple learned that their eight-year-old dog was sick ‚Äî they had an inoperable brain tumor.  Veterinarians said that with treatment the dog will be able to live for another 18 months. </li><li>  30 June.  The dog died due to a cardiac arrest. </li><li>  July 2  Dylan froze.  The pair bought medical equipment for sampling the dog's skin.  Samples were sent to Sooam, South Korea. </li><li>  4th of July.  Samples arrived in South Korea. </li><li>  July 6th.  Sooam representatives told the couple that the selected samples are not suitable for cloning operations. </li><li>  July 7th.  The company requested other samples from the pair (the dog was still in a frozen state). </li><li>  July 10th.  New batch of genetic material selected. </li><li>  July 11th.  The material arrived in South Korea.  For the first time, the cloning operation is carried out from the material selected 12 days after the death of the organism. </li><li>  October 21.  Cells grow, the cloning process has begun. </li><li>  November 23  Confirmed pregnancy surrogate mother - female boxer. </li><li>  November 24th  Confirmed pregnancy and the second dog, which also introduced the genetic material of Dylan. </li><li>  December 26th.  Born the first puppy - clone Dylan. </li><li>  December 29th.  The appearance of a second clone is expected. </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/367469/">https://habr.com/ru/post/367469/</a></p>
