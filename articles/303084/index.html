Andrey is sure that this library is much more convenient for writing tests than the standard unittest.  By the way, we recently had a <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it_people/blog/302970/">short interview</a> with Andrew about the python language and not only. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e8b/d4e/d6d/e8bd4ed6d8b4784f38ce46be03d03132.jpg" width="100" height="100" title="borisov.jpg" alt="borisov.jpg" align="left">  Everyone wants to know how their code is executed.

If someone else, how to organize a sandbox, which will not allow to execute arbitrary code?  How to arrange an API and select the desired level of abstraction?
