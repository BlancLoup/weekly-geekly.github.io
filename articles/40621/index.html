  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How Sun Sponsors Open Source Part One</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This spring, Sun has invested in open source.  <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/grant/overview.html">1.000.000 US dollars were allocated for the stimulation of the sensor activity</a> .  Despite the relative <i>(light irony)</i> freshness of the news, I, as a direct participant in the events, will cover the topic unfairly deprived of attention. <br><img src="http://blogs.sun.com/theaquarium/resource/GlassFish-Logo-140_92.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.officetweaks.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/openoffice_logo.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.netbeans.org/images/visual-guidelines/NB-logo-single.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.dataclinic.co.uk/solaris-logo.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Continued under the cut <br>  In Java-opensource and just Java-developers, this spring was extremely successful.  First came GlassFish V2.  This is a megacool thing that supports JEE 5. I would not say that the ‚Äúglass fish‚Äù is inferior in its TTX, for example, JBoss or WebSphere Application Server.  Playfully went to the masses OpenOffice.  About Solaris can not say anything.  Once, on a virtual machine with Solaris, I tried to install Sun Portal, nothing happened, I had to put it aside.  And finally, one of the most convenient, functional and low-key development environments - NetBeans.  By the way, from version 6.0 there is an active embedding of PHP support.  The goal of the All-Union competition is the promotion of innovative projects, developments based on one of these products.  The competition also involved the community OpenSparc and OpenJDK. <br><br><h4>  Openoffice </h4>  I tried to write my master's work in OpenOffice in order to wipe the nose of the powerful MS Word with a personal example.  Unfortunately, the promised compatibility between MS Word and Writer is not always ‚Äúcombined‚Äù.  I had to type out the written text in Word'e. <br>  At OpenOffice $ 175,000 was allocated.  First place - 75.000, second - 50.000, third - 25.000.  There was a separate prize - 25.000, something like a spectator award.  The works were evaluated according to the following characteristics: <br><ul><li>  Originality </li><li>  The complexity of the project, an elegant solution to a complex problem </li><li>  Relevance for the OpenOffice community </li><li>  The attention that the community has with the project </li><li>  OpenOffice community participation in development </li></ul><br>  Grants in the OpenOffice, GlassFish and Solaris communities have been heard for off-the-shelf solutions.  Those.  by the time of the application for the grant, the project either had to be ready or be at the last stage.  In the NetBeans community, there were other rules that I thought were more interesting.  At first, everyone who submitted applications for participation in the competition, in which they described their projects, explained why they were needed, what benefits they had, and also wrote a plan for implementation.  The judges reviewed the applications for a month, then chose those that would eventually be rewarded.  Naturally, the reward was given only to those who brought their project to the end, the result coincided with the opportunities stated at the beginning of the competition.  Thus, starting to work, developers knew for sure that their successful work would not go unnoticed.  In three other communities there was no opportunity to do something - it was necessary to let existing designs go to the competition.  Naturally, the circle of potential participants has become very narrow.  Projects were divided into categories: <br><ul><li>  Technical: completion of the system kernel, extensions, porting </li><li>  Social: new methods of interaction within the community, achievements in the market, artistic work, any other contribution to OpenOffice, which increased its popularity among users and / or developers. </li><li>  Tech Tools: that help distribute the OpenOffice package.  This localization and more convenient development environment, management tools, assemblies, etc.  In general, everything that facilitates the work of programmers. </li><li>  OpenDocument Format (ODF): projects that move ODF to the masses. </li><li>  Documentation: Treatment of the disease of many open source projects (commercial ones also often suffer from this) - the lack of sane documentation for both developers and users.  Yet they want to code who wants to mess with papers. </li><li>  Special: something special.  A description of any project could be sent to this category. </li></ul><br><br>  Unfortunately, I could not find the winners of this competition.  I am afraid that due to the strict conditions of the competition there were no worthy applicants for the prize. <br>  In the next part, I will discuss in detail the competition held in the NetBeans community.  There were winners! </div>
