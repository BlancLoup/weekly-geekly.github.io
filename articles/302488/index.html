      <b>In retail, the largest number (52%) of interactions with customers, in comparison with other industries.</b>  According to the study ‚ÄúState of the Customer Journey‚Äù, conducted by Kitewheel, their number has increased by 5% since last year.  For this work, we analyzed more than 1 billion customer interactions with brands. <br><br>  The multichannel level of consumer communication ‚Äî including web, email and offline activity ‚Äî depends on the industry in question.  This is approximately the marketing mix rating by fields of activity: <br><br>  <b>52% - Retail</b> <b><br><br></b>  <b>15% - Travel</b> <b><br><br></b>  <b>11% - Health</b> <b><br><br></b>  <b>10% - Telecom</b> <b><br><br></b>  <b>8% - Auto</b> <b><br><br></b>  <b>2% - Education</b> <br><br>  However, not all channels are equivalent.  For example, most of the financial investments of brands fall on mobile applications, web, email and social media, and the role of each of these channels is constantly changing. <br><br>  The emphasis on web and email is constantly growing, while with the onset of the crisis, spending on social media has noticeably declined.  Mobile is in a rather interesting position. <br><br>  Customer interactions with brands via mobile applications are at the very bottom (with a total number of transactions less than 1%), but in general this channel shows quite impressive results - an <b>increase 10 times greater than in any other marketing activity, without any signs of slowing down.</b> <br><br>  Of course, through the application it is more difficult to track what specifically affected the purchase.  We cannot know for sure the dependence of the committed action on the transaction, as it is possible in offline stores.  However, mobile applications are much more convenient and significant for users than mobile versions of sites, although they require much more investment and effort from companies. <br><br>  Not surprisingly, retail today occupies a leading position in terms of the use of multi-channel marketing.  Through mobile devices, consumers can easily make purchases 24/7, while in transport, on the road, at home, and even directly in the store. <br><br>  Numerous studies show that consumers often ‚Äúmonitor‚Äù the prices of products through smartphones, while already in the store, to compare the cost and make a better purchase. <br><br>  The Kitewheel study once again confirms that getting information about brands and products and making purchases through one channel is far in the past.  Multiple screens, mobile, and desktop provide the consumer with a huge list of options, and customers can improve marketing activity using time and geolocation indicators. <br><br>  Travel lovers, for example, know that using several kinds of devices before, during and after a trip is common.  When traveling, the user can call the airline consultant, access the mobile version of the site to clarify the question of interest, book a ticket through the mobile application, and after landing, go back to the application to see where to get the luggage. <br><br>  <b>248 million US residents interact with digital content, 156 million of whom prefer travel content.</b>  If we talk about the layout of the type of mobile devices, the <b>majority (63%) receive information and are active through smartphones, 41% through the desktop and 27% through tablets</b> - such data leads ComScore, who conducted research among smartphone owners in the US. <br><br>  Of course, such a multichannel process concerns not only the sphere of air travel.  This also includes hotel reservations, car rental and much more. <br><br>  Summarizing all the above, one key conclusion can be made.  <b>Each interaction in the composition of the multichannel strategy gives companies the opportunity to increase their value to the consumer.</b>  <b>The more options of ‚Äúcommunication‚Äù with the brand will be provided to the client, the more comfort he will experience, respectively, and the loyalty to the company will grow.</b>  <b>And the higher the loyalty to the brand, the greater the financial benefits in the future awaiting business.</b> <br><br> <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/register/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dcontent_marketing"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/041/3c5/29a/0413c529a1424210a02b160e54a40e80.png"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr02062016"><b>BYYD ‚Ä¢ Mobile Advertising Platform</b></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/302488/">https://habr.com/ru/post/302488/</a></p>
