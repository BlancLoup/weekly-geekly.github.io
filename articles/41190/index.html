  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Online psychologist - Start</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In this series of posts you will be able to see the history of the creation and development of the Internet project, which so far can be briefly described as an <b>‚ÄúOnline Psychologist‚Äù</b> .  But it will not be just a ‚Äústory‚Äù, but a multifaceted narration from different angles: from programming to marketing.  I think the information will be interesting to many.  We also hope for constructive advice and criticism.  Otherwise, there is no way - because it is Habr! :) <br><br>  <b>A few words about yourself:</b> <br>  On Habr√© relatively recently, but I have been developing web applications for about 6 years.  Basically, all the projects were ‚Äúmade to order‚Äù, but recently I decided that we need to act: enough to create projects ‚Äúfor an uncle‚Äù - it's time to think about our own.  I have enough passive experience in this matter - I love, you know, to watch as it starts what I wrote myself.  But the active ... <br><br>  <b>Idea and business model:</b> <br>  It all started, as always, with a simple one: with a beer with my friend.  For several years he has been engaged in NLP practitioners at the trainer level, as well as in private psychological counseling.  And if in short, he gave me that the business of providing psychological services in Russia lags behind the west by 8-12 years.  For example, only now we have people realize that psychological training is a very profitable business.  And in the west, the wave began to rise just in the early 90s.  If you notice this, then it becomes clear that a wave of psychological services through the Internet is about to overwhelm us.  Well, why not anticipate her in something?

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, our idea was born simple: the provision of psychological services on the Internet. <br>  Here are the following main advantages: <br><ul><li>  Anonymity: it is sometimes desirable to solve your problem anonymously, rather than shuffle through a real consultation and face to face with a living person </li><li>  Price: psychologists from different parts of our country can provide services via the Internet, and therefore the price of consultation for the client will be lower </li><li>  Income of a specialist: again, due to the use of the Internet, a specialist from the ‚Äúhinterland‚Äù will be able to get more than if he worked offline </li><li>  The breadth of the range of services: as a rule, the psychologist specializes in 2‚Äì3 adjacent areas.  Accordingly, if we attract a sufficient number of specialists via the Internet, then it is possible to cover the full range of areas within one service. </li></ul><br>  According to this idea, two possible business models were derived (in fact, there are more of them, but the rest became extinct after analyzing ‚Äúin words‚Äù): <br><ul><li>  The principle of "freelance exchanges": that is, we provide only services to mix together a psychologist and a client.  In essence, the psychologist acts as a freelancer, and the client as a ‚Äúproject customer‚Äù. </li><li>  The principle of "one-stop service": we ourselves hire psychologists and pay them a significant percentage </li></ul><br>  After analyzing these two models and mathematical modeling, we came to the conclusion that the second approach is much more profitable.  (If anyone is interested, I can send calculations.) And the main reason why this is exactly the following can be called: The consultation lasts much less time than the development of the project, respectively, one psychologist can spend about 10-12 consultations per day.  That is, the ratio of the number of clients to the number of specialists is much greater than for freelancing. <br><br>  So, the business model is defined.  The following tasks followed this: <br><ol><li>  Website development for the selected business model </li><li>  Development of contract prototypes for a client (public offer) and a psychologist (employment contract) </li><li>  Search for psychologists </li><li>  Advertising service </li><li>  Settlement organization </li><li>  etc. </li></ol><br>  Each of these points we will try to separately highlight in subsequent posts. <br><br>  PS I hope that habritse will perceive this series adequately, that is, not as an advertising campaign.  After all, judge for yourself: according to statistics, people employed in IT are less likely to turn to a psychologist, which means that Habr is far from a target audience.  The main goals of these publications for us are: the opportunity for ourselves to sort everything out, as well as to receive advice and recommendations from more experienced comrades. <br>  PPS If after reading, someone has a desire to participate in the project, then please write in private messages. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/41190/">https://habr.com/ru/post/41190/</a></p>
