  <section class="page js-page"><h1>PEPSI-DEGENERATION</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently read in LJ.  Somewhere in Germany, and in the long run it doesn‚Äôt matter where, some Turks, not important Turks or non-Turks, slapped a girl who was with her boyfriend on the pope.  A guy with a swing hit the Turk in the face, caused him damage.  That same evening this young man was killed, his pregnant girlfriend was raped and beaten. <br><br>  People copy this story to themselves, give a link, call it a gift.  Well, did not fucked, sheep torn? <br><br>  They talk about order, about Russia for Russians.  Why do they talk about it when something happens, in the sort of events like this?  It became interesting to me, and I decided to think and write on this topic.

      I thought not for long, I must say.  Nobody who screams thinks that the guy who was killed did what he did.  Did he hit that Turk, defending what was dear to him, or obeying the herd instinct of the owner?  In my opinion, it is more interesting to think in this vein than to proceed with saliva, trying to justify your worthless existence. <br><br>  What are values?  Values, including for the sake of what you are ready to put your life.  Neither more nor less.  I think if a meteorite hits the Earth, few people will blame someone for inaction, and will anyone blame anyone ... <br><br>  There are fears in people.  In my life, about death, about what else.  All this is agitated when something happens on a nearby site.  And nothing has changed. <br><br>  That is, the guy is dead.  And the point.  Well, if consciously put at risk themselves and their women.  The reverse looks silly.  And, sorry, what is the national question here, come to your senses.  The measure has a man.  Died in battle almost.  He died.  HIS acts.  Who gives the right to judge? <br><br>  Plus pride.  Yes, we are so great, Russian, that we can not stop smoking.  Yes, we are Russian, that we have the right to hate others, and draw conclusions about their non-Aryan origin. <br><br>  To die for what is really expensive is worth it.  To die from the fact that you don‚Äôt give a damn about your own life and the lives of other people, or you didn‚Äôt even think about it, that's hard to watch. <br><br>  Quo liset jovi non liset bovi.  Snickersny and go away. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/7103/">https://habr.com/ru/post/7103/</a></p>
