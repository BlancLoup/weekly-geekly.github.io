  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Technodom - new low cost hoster</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In mid-February, I saw on Twitter a message about the launch of a new low cost hoster - Technodom.  Then I did not pay attention to him, but recently I came across their new way to promote servers - an auction, in which the initial cost of the server was only 30 rubles.  This made me consider this project in more detail.  Under a cat I will try to tell in more detail. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First of all, I wondered who could offer such servers at such a nice price, since a new player in the market would clearly not have got involved in such a risky project.  As the ‚ÄúContacts‚Äù page has shown, this is a Selectel project, which is already fairly well known to the habrasocommunity.  It was strange for me that Selectel himself was not promoting this project on his own behalf.  In my opinion, this would make it easier to attract potential customers to a new project.  But, whether they are afraid to get the outflow of major customers from the main services of the company towards such a risky project, or they want to accumulate some mass of clients to debug all the nuances of the new project.  But I think enough of the lyrics, let's consider their new proposal. <br><br>  I will not give a description of the configurations, each of you will be able to see them on their website, to choose from: the new i3-i5-i7 processors, DDR3 4-32GB memory, 2-12TB disks.  I would like to note that prices are indeed lower, but consider what lies behind them: <br><br>  + new platforms based on Ivy Bridge <br>  + large selection of server configurations <br>  + 100Mbit / sec channel <br>  - one IPv4 address that cannot be transferred between machines <br>  - there is no possibility of combining servers into a local network <br>  - installation fee, 3000 when ordering less than six months <br>  + verified DC <br>  + good connectivity (channel from Selectel) <br>  + support (it seems that too from Selectel) <br>  - desktop iron <br>  - no IPv6

      In my opinion, the price covers the disadvantages, since you can take more servers and build a more fault-tolerant system than spend the same money on one more stable server platform and get a much less fault-tolerant in the end.  After all, equipment always breaks down, just some less often, some more often, and here we have an understanding right away that equipment is not so stable and this feature of it should simply be incorporated into the design of the future service. <br><br>  Passing, finally, to the reason why I decided to write this post - Auction, I would like to note that I have never seen such a method of selling servers on the Russian market (even Hertzner has an auction organized differently).  As I have already said, the initial price is only 30 rubles, and there is also no installation fee, that is, the price at which the auction can be won will be the final price for the first month of the rental of this server.  Oh yes, an interesting config is played out in the auction: Intel i3-3217U, 8GB RAM, 30GB SSD, 100Mbit / sec channel.  Initially, again, I was skeptical of this undertaking, the history of the first auctions shows that the struggle for owning this server was extremely sluggish, but the last auction in the last minutes made everyone sweat and the server went even more expensive than its monthly cost!  You can see the history of all auctions on their page <a href="https://tehnodom.com/auction/">tehnodom.com/auction</a> <br><br>  PS Today, by the way, they have one of the regular auctions ending, I propose to follow the last minutes of the auction) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/184112/">https://habr.com/ru/post/184112/</a></p>
