  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Current Internet Marketing Trends in 2007</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At the annual exhibition <a href="http://www.ad-tech.com/">AD: TECH</a> , <a href="http://www.marketingsherpa.com/">MarketingSherpa</a> conducted a survey of marketing specialists from major corporations.  The questions concerned the most relevant recent trends: Web 2.0, using videos instead of rich media, search engine optimization. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In December 2006, 332 respondents were surveyed, who in 2006 allocated 46% of their advertising budgets online (this figure will increase to 49% in 2007).  The results of an exclusive study along with six diagrams are <a href="http://www.marketingsherpa.com/sample.cfm%3Fident%3D29857">published in the public domain</a> . <br><br>  <b>ROI search engine marketing and mailings</b> <br>  The fourth year ago, the effectiveness of investment (ROI) in search marketing and mailing lists turned out to be almost the same: these methods were called effective by 49% and 47% of marketers, respectively.  At the same time, a significant increase in the popularity of search engine optimization (SEO) is striking.  It seems that marketers are beginning to appreciate the benefits of "organic search advertising": its rating for the year increased from 33% to 45%. <br><br>  <b>ROI advertising methods</b> <br>  In 2006, almost all Internet marketing technologies became less effective in the eyes of marketers, including behavioral targeting (a drop in the rating over the year from 36% to 34%), contextual targeting (from 31% to 29%), affiliate programs (from 29 % to 25%), pop-ups and ‚Äúlining‚Äù (from 22% to 15%).  The absolute leader in terms of falling popularity is rich media banners, whose rating among marketers fell from 38% to 28%.  The least effective, as always, are the usual graphic banners (12%). 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

        </script>
      <br>
      Apparently, the record fall in the rating of rich media is due to the phenomenal growth in the popularity of video advertising (this is a natural evolution of multimedia advertising).  As you know, online video has become one of the main sensations of 2006.  Many companies now prefer viral marketing and video ‚Äúleakage‚Äù to the Internet, <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/blog/lenta/4084.html">like Euroset, for example</a> . <br><br>  Just on this topic recently conducted a <a href="http://www.emarketer.com/Reports/All/Em_video_internet_nov06.aspx">study by the</a> company eMarketer.  It turned out that in 2006 the video advertising sector on the Internet grew by 82.2%, and in 2007 it is expected to grow by 89%. <br><br>  <b>Increase budgets in 2007</b> <br>  What are the companies planning to increase advertising budgets in 2007?  In the first place here is search advertising.  Expenditures on it plan to increase 34% of companies (when answering, an increase of at least 5% was taken into account).  A good financial future awaits the mailing sector in its own address base (27% of companies will increase the budget), rich-media, audio and video (25%), SEO (25%), contextual advertising (22%).  The most vague are the prospects for mailing lists on foreign address databases (10%), affiliate programs (14%), behavioral targeting (18%) and traditional static banners (20%). <br><br>  <b>Analytical Tests and Performance Measurements</b> <br>  Quite curious about what methods marketers measure the effectiveness of their activities, as well as what trends are observed here compared to last year.  For example, last year, marketers most often answered this question that they are going to upgrade the web analytics system (61%).  Now web analytics are no longer as relevant (52%), giving way to the primacy of search advertising effectiveness analysis systems (64% compared to last year‚Äôs 56%). <br><br>  In addition, the popularity of systems for comparing the effectiveness of landing pages on the site (from 51% to 56%), tracking of combined online / offline campaigns (from 46% to 51%), as well as brand awareness assessment systems for online campaigns (from 33 % to 42%). <br><br>  Compared to last year, the popularity of integrated web analytics with search and mail advertising (50%) and <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/column/1314/">usability testing</a> (23%) did not change.  It is still not very popular to track the direction of view of visitors to a web page (an increase from 15% to 18%). <br><br>  <b>Web 2.0</b> <br>  Not passed by marketers and hype around Web 2.0.  Last year, investment in creating RSS feeds (40%), own blogs (35%), other people's blogs (30%), video advertising (27%), advertising in feeds (21%), mobile / wireless versions ( 20%), own podcasts (18%), sponsored podcasts (14%), placing their products inside computer games (10%).  True, in some positions the hype is already declining, as can be seen in the diagram. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/669/f63/9b7/669f639b77185c52f6f9db194fd2f058.gif" width="368" height="514" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  <b>What to spend money on?</b> <br>  Favorite question of this kind of research: "What would you spend $ 100 thousand if your director or client gave you this money and asked to invest in some kind of technology that can be very effective?"  The answers are as follows: <br><br>  1. Video - 18.1%. <br>  2. Social networks, Web 2.0 - 15.2%. <br>  3. Mobile technology - 11.9%. <br>  4. SEO - 8.4%. <br>  5. Viral marketing - 7.3%. <br>  6. Search advertising - 6.6%. <br>  7. Microsites / landing pages - 5.5%. <br>  8. Email - 4.1%. <br>  9. The rest (another 31 variants) - 22.9%. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/2927/">https://habr.com/ru/post/2927/</a></p>
