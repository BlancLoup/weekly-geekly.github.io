      Height 178, weight 70, drink nothing stronger than beer, I smoke, water tourism is my hobby.  No: bald patches, complexes, abdomen, nerves, glasses, gray hair.  I work without directors, I can explain easily, I can teach. <br><br>  With humor, everything is in order.  I know that 1 m2 of housing in Perm costs 28,000 rubles.  After the release of 1C 8.0 (7 programming languages ‚Äã‚Äã"inside"), I agree with international practice: the cost of a SINGLE line of a debugged and documented program is 10 y.  e. Well, in Russia, BYE this kind of money is not paid to programmers - but appreciate the EFFICIENCY.  From the abundance of languages ‚Äã‚Äãin which it is necessary to make improvements, "the roof goes."  ONE book on Oracle 10G (in English) costs 32,000 rubles.  Just as the Mujahideen cannot fight with American weapons (only Russian), programmers in Russia can NOT work effectively with Oracle if their salary per month is less than the cost of the THREE books.  For the "competent" work with such systems DOMA need to have 10 books. <br><br>  Difficult relationships with appliances and wires.  Foreign countries: Germany, Spain, Italy, Canary Islands, Malta, Morocco, Poland, Slovakia, Turkey, France, Czech Republic. <br><br>  Prescribed ......., I live: ... Wife ... full name ... born in 1968, son of 1990 and daughter of born in 1993, absolute harmony in the family. <br><br>  Tel.  8-902 -........., ...... @ MAIL.RU, WWW ....... Narod.RU <br><br>  Passport ... ......, 08.21.03 ATS Len.  district ... <br><br>  I can change this kingdom of the guard: the city (the former mayor - Standarfenf√ºhrer of the Ministry of Internal Affairs), the region (the governor is the Hauptsturmf√ºhrer of the KGB), the country (the president is the obershurtmbannf√ºhrer of the KGB). <br><br>  From the employer: <br><br>  1. The realization that the maintenance of computers (tank) requires services: <br><br>  1.1.  Electronic engineer (surgeon). <br><br>  1.2.  Network administrator (neuropathologist). <br><br>  1.3.  System administrator (therapist). <br><br>  2. Awareness: ONE Base 1C Integrated (1 more tank) requires services: <br><br>  2.1.  Programmer 1C Trade (gynecologist). <br><br>  2.3.  Programmer 1C Accounting (dentist). <br><br>  2.3.  Programmer 1C Salary (dermatologist). <br><br>  2.4.  Programmer 1C-CML-RBD for the exchange of information between the bases (endocrinologist, + gynecologist + dentist + dermatologist). <br><br>  2.5.  SQL Server Administrator, if 1C - such (neurosurgeon). <br><br>  3. If the services of these specialists are NOT used, then from computers and programs you can only get a continuous headache. <br><br>  4.1.  Understanding that the maintenance of the NEXT 1C base increases the load on programmers by 2.5 times. <br><br>  4.2.  The realization that the presence in one database of several legal entities.  persons requires the participation of these legal entities.  individuals in the salary of programmers. <br><br>  5.1.  To accept as an axiom that the BUYING of a solid program is FAVORABLE than its development (You buy a Mercedes in a store and do not place an order for its WELDING in a GARAGE to a familiar mechanic.). <br><br>  6.1.  Improvements in 1C, made by changing the objects of the SUPPLIER: <br><br>  6.1.1 They will put your company on the ‚Äúneedle‚Äù - eternal dependence on the developer, since  the next version of 1C "wash" ALL the improvements; <br><br>  6.1.2.  Deprive your firm of the ability to use the work of more than 600 Moscow-based 1C specialists for 7,000 rubles.  per year (ITS); <br><br>  6.1..3 You will have to hire a GROUP of developers who will SPEED for changes in legislation. <br><br>  7.1.  Documented improvements in 1C WITHOUT changes to SUPPLIER objects will create absolute comfort for your company (it is NOT the car that changes every month UPDATED with the ITS disk, but the TRAILER to it). <br><br>  The main task of a 1C programmer is to formulate requirements <br><br>  to the modifications, so that it would not be ‚Äúpainfully painful‚Äù when updating 1C from the ITS disk. <br><br>  8.1.  Understanding of the fact that there are inexperienced specialists (Lada - a penny) and experienced specialists (Mercedes 600).  The choice is yours. <br><br>  9.1 I read the ad ‚ÄúA firm needs a sysadmin with 1c knowledge‚Äù: ‚ÄúA firm needs a neuropathologist, a therapist, a gynecologist, a dentist, a dermatologist, an endocrinologist, a neurosurgeon in 1 person, at ONE rate‚Äù.  It is difficult to program SIMULTANEOUSLY in 3 or more languages, and it is impossible to be a SPECIALIST also in related industries. <br><br>  The level of competence of the personnel department and the company as a whole is visible. <br><br>  10.1. For ALL the operating time, I saw literate users ONCE (PTTP company) ONCE.  Usually, up to 20% of the time is spent on requests like ‚Äúand how to switch the keyboard to Russian font‚Äù <br><br>  Conclusions: for making adequate decisions on the 1C leader <br><br>  any level you need to remember 4 numbers and 4 "images": <br><br>  1‚Äì ONE once a month the old version of the program is ‚Äúwashed off‚Äù. <br><br>  ONE programmer maintains ONE base 1C, if the configuration is changed. <br><br>  5 - if the company has less than 5% of employees in the IT department, this company will die. <br><br>  10 - cu  cost of ONE line of the debugged, documented program. <br><br>  15 000 - the salary of the graduate KNOWLEDGE - the programmer 1 8.0. <br><br>  ‚ÄúNeedle‚Äù - you can ‚Äúsit down‚Äù on it, if you are free to use the configuration of the Supplier. <br><br>  "Trailer" - all improvements must be done in the "containers" of the trailer. <br><br>  A new version of the ‚Äúcar‚Äù comes ‚Äî the Supplier‚Äôs configuration ‚Äî we unhook the trailer from the old car, install the new configuration, hook up the trailer to the new car. <br><br>  ‚ÄúElectronic engineer‚Äù - an electronic engineer DOES NOT solder the boards, DOES NOT pour the system blocks, does NOT manufacture monitors, speakers, and disk drives.  He buys all this at the request of departments. <br><br>  The programmer should NOT write programs, he should FORMULATE the requirements for the modifications that the developer will carry out.  The program is a PRODUCT that is produced in PROFILE enterprises. <br><br>  ‚ÄúHelicopter‚Äù - if a company bought 1C, then it bought a helicopter, and EVERY employee of the company who is related to 1C should take a theoretical and practical course on driving this helicopter. <br><br>  Labor biography. <br><br>  01. 09.76 - 03.80.  ........, economist, programmer. <br><br>  02. 03.80 ‚Äì01.87. ...
