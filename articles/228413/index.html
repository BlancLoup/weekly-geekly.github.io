No one likes unfinished business, and because of this you can slightly increase the efficiency of the online store. <br><br>  <b>Some statistics</b>

      According to a study conducted by Statista Inc.  In the UK, about 67% of the filled baskets of online stores were never purchased.  The user simply left the site without completing the purchase process, and never again bought these products in this online store.  Those.  almost all the stores in England receive less than half the profits. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <u>The agency provides the main factors that caused this result:</u> <br><br>  1. In the process of placing an order, the price increased due to unforeseen factors - 16.14% <br><br>  2. I just watched - 10.66% <br><br>  3. Found the best price elsewhere - 10.37% <br><br>  4. The total price was too high - 9.22% <br><br>  5. I decided not to buy - 7.49% <br><br>  6. Too complicated site navigation - 7.20% <br><br>  7. Drop in the site - 6.92% <br><br>  8. The process of placing an order is delayed - 6.05% <br><br>  9. Excessive zeal of the store when verifying the user details, a large number of fields that must be filled to confirm the authenticity - 5.19% <br><br>  10. Fear of becoming a victim of fraudsters - 4.90% <br><br>  11. Delivery terms are inappropriate - 4.61% <br><br>  12. Slow site - 4.32% <br><br>  13. Prices are in foreign currency - 3.75% <br><br>  14. My payment was declined - 3.17% <br><br>  Now let's take a closer look at the reasons for the refusal, they can be divided into several groups: <br><br>  - points 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13 and 14 - non-price factors that you can easily get around by providing a direct link to a page in the letter from which the customer can easily complete the purchase process.  Remember that the longer the payment process, the greater the chance that the customer will leave.  Thanks to these points, you can return about a third of all abandoned customers; <br><br>  - points 1, 3 and 4 require more detailed analysis in each case.  Additional payments that unexpectedly increase the price of the goods at the time of the order - a bad tone that makes the buyer feel that they are trying to inflate.  Discard them or continue losing customers.  In the case of ‚Äúfinding the best price elsewhere‚Äù and ‚Äúthe total price turned out to be too high‚Äù, it is necessary to assess the customer‚Äôs prospects based on the amount of the unfinished order and the composition of the basket.  If there is reason to believe that a customer has a high purchasing power and his attraction will become a source of frequent and tangible purchases, you can offer him a discount that will make your offer more attractive. <br><br>  Other items, such as "just watched" and "decided not to buy", you can also try to get around with a discount, but for them the effectiveness of this approach is much lower. <br><br>  To understand which group each visitor belongs to, use the activity tracking tools. <br><br>  <b>What to do with it and how is it connected with the sequence?</b> <br><br>  Some of these factors are easily eliminated by optimizing the site and increasing the stability of its work.  But still need to force visitors to return to the site.  For this, the most traditional method that you can imagine is the perfect one - mailing.  Naturally, for this you must receive from the visitor a mail at one of the stages of the purchase. <br><br>  The received letter, provided that it nullifies the factors that caused the refusal to purchase, to zero, creates an ‚Äúunfinished business‚Äù, which appeals to the principle of consistency.  If, at the time of receipt of the letter, the customer has not made a purchase in another store, he has no reason not to buy the product from you. <br><br>  Targeted mailing, based on the analysis of factors of failure and visitor activity on the site, will be quite an effective tool to increase sales. <br><br>  Not a bad <a href="http://www.shopify.com/blog/12522201-13-amazing-abandoned-cart-emails-and-what-you-can-learn-from-them">article</a> with examples of such mailings. <br><br>  <b>Some more statistics</b> and <br><br>  <a href="http://www.getelastic.com/cart-abandonment-stats-infographic/">Here</a> is a great infographic about the effectiveness of ‚Äúreturn‚Äù letters.  According to these data, about half of these letters will be opened, more than 13% of recipients follow the link, and a third of them will complete the purchase process.  Simple calculations tell us that with such letters we can increase the number of our clients by 13.6%.  This means that if your customers made purchases in the amount of 100,000 per year, a simple mailing will bring you about 13,600. <br><br>  <b>How else can we use the principle of consistency</b> <br><br>  You can see a great example of using this principle every day in self-service stores (supermarkets).  The moment when the visitor takes the goods in hand, significantly increases the likelihood of making a purchase. <br><br>  In the context of Internet commerce, this can be beaten in two ways: <br><br>  - simple and free delivery guarantee.  Make ‚Äúdisliked‚Äù sufficient reason to return, provided that the product has retained its presentation and has the original packaging.  The visitor should know that for a certain period he can easily get his money back. <br><br>  - test period (marketing version of the first method).  The process of making a purchase gives the client a feeling that he takes on some obligations, which can be an obstacle to the transaction.  Offer him another option.  He leaves a cash deposit (transfers to your account an amount comparable to the value of the goods), and you give him the goods for "temporary use".  Return is possible under the same conditions as in the first embodiment. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/228413/">https://habr.com/ru/post/228413/</a></p>
