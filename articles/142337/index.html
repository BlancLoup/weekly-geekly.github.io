Contrary to expectations, the development of netbooks continues, new models appear, and we continue to inform you about updates.  At one time, too many indistinguishable "clones" appeared on the market, copying each other's characteristics and appearance.  Under pressure from the tablets, the situation began to change.  We hope that it changes for the better. <br><br>  The Model 1011CX is the first ASUS netbook on the new Intel Cedar Trail platform, made on a 32-nanometer process.  The letter ‚ÄúC‚Äù in the model name indicates the hardware basis (Cedar Trail), and ‚ÄúX‚Äù characterizes the model as referring to the initial level.  According to the developers, the performance (including the graphics core) has increased, and the power consumption has decreased.  Let's see if this is true.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Specifications</b> <br><br>  The graphics chip and the memory controller are located in the same package as the processor, which allows reducing the size of the board and reducing the heat release of the system.  At the heart of the device is a dual-core processor Intel Atom N2600, running at 1.6 GHz.  The GMA 3600 graphics core operates at 400 MHz.  Productivity is enough for most everyday tasks (office, web surfing), even HD video playback is available in 720p resolution. <br><br>  In the system 2 GB of RAM is the maximum amount.  Not thickly, but in my practice, more indignation is caused by the desire of the manufacturer to install the meaningless 8 GB in the maximum configuration.  Until the netbook learns to make you coffee, there is no sense to install more than 2/4 GB of memory.  The remaining specifications are standard: 320 GB hard drive, WiFi (802.11 b / g / n), Bluetooth, three USB 2.0 ports, VGA, HDMI, RJ-45, card reader, 0.3 MP webcam, headphone jack and microphone input. <br><br>  <b>Display</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c41/768/758/c417687581dcdd29264c913979bb0998.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The novelty uses a typical 10-inch screen with a resolution of 1024 by 600 pixels.  However, the resolution is not the most important property for a screen of this size.  It is more interesting, in my opinion, to evaluate the type of screen - and yes, in this model it is matte.  Viewing angles, the available range of brightness, color gamut correspond to the stated budget level.  The parameters do not cause discomfort, but the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãobviously of lower quality than in the models of the next level (in comparison, for example, with ASUS Eee PC 1025CE). <br><br>  <b>Design</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/17a/e11/b3d/17ae11b3ddc6c3031026370e5aa0ed48.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8b4/fa2/246/8b4fa2246ba951cd3f0d51d5b505b2f6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The netbook case is slightly different from its predecessors.  The cover is attached to the bottom panel with two small but strong hinges.  The location of the communication ports changed slightly: the air vent on the left side of the netbook was moved closer to the middle, and the HDMI port became closer to the front edge. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/665/d0f/24c/665d0f24c90b83f72fdf43c33f30d9f4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The bottom panel has good stiffness and is not subject to deformation when pressed.  In the bottom of the case are cut several vents.  Unfortunately, there is no quick access to the components - you have to disassemble the case. <br><br>  For the 1011CX model, two color options are available: black and white.  The body finish uses a pleasant to the touch textured matte plastic that is resistant to the appearance of prints, but the frame around the screen is still glossy. <br><br>  <b>Ergonomics</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b67/b32/4d3/b67b324d3187b536c5d2ba4d9bbdea41.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The working panel is made of a material of the same color and texture as the cover.  The island keyboard is typical for ASUS netbooks.  It is convenient to type text, the keys have a small stroke, they are pressed easily.  Activity indicators are located on the right edge. <br><br>  The touch panel of the netbook ASUS Eee PC 1011CX has its own characteristics.  It is primarily distinguished by its large size.  The panel is really able to replace the mouse.  The multitouch technology is supported: you can adjust the image scale with your fingers, you can flip the pages in different directions.  The touchpad has good sensitivity. <br><br>  The speakers are hidden in the bottom.  The volume is not great, it‚Äôs impossible to count on low and high frequencies, but the main task - to output the sound - the speakers cope.  Watch the movie without connecting headphones, it is quite possible. <br><br>  <b>Battery life</b> <br><br>  With the active work of the netbook does not heat up - an obvious advantage of using the platform Intel Cedar Trail.  And thanks to the high battery capacity and low power consumption, the netbook shows impressive battery life - up to 10 hours.  The ASUS 1011CX has a compact power supply that doesn‚Äôt create additional problems on the road.  And the weight of the device is only 1.25 kg. <br><br>  <b>Technology</b> <br><br>  The ASUS Super Hybrid Engine II (SHE II) power-saving technology allows the netbook to stay in standby for up to 17 days.  And Instant On technology will bring devices out of sleep in just 2 seconds.  In addition, the built-in security system will automatically save data to the hard disk when the battery level drops below 5%. <br><br>  ASUS Express Gate - the built-in operating system - will allow to go online without booting Windows. <br><br>  <b>findings</b> <br><br>  Revolution did not happen again, we have another good ASUS product.  On the other hand, what innovative changes are we expecting from netbooks?  Devices of this class have only a few simple requirements: show video / Internet, run on battery for a long time, do not scare the buyer‚Äôs wallet.  You can indefinitely increase the power of the processor, increase the battery life - the user will be happy to accept innovations if the device does not go beyond the price corridor set for netbooks.  As long as netbooks are asked for less than for popular tablet computers, they will be interesting to us. <br><br>  <b>Pros:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d94/1cf/f3f/d941cff3f3f2d7f2ec4359bf67b70a3a.png" alt="image">  low gloss; <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d94/1cf/f3f/d941cff3f3f2d7f2ec4359bf67b70a3a.png" alt="image">  low price; <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d94/1cf/f3f/d941cff3f3f2d7f2ec4359bf67b70a3a.png" alt="image">  battery life; <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d94/1cf/f3f/d941cff3f3f2d7f2ec4359bf67b70a3a.png" alt="image">  three USB ports and HDMI output. <br><br>  <b>Minuses:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1f5/020/1b6/1f50201b64f0b792030b3cb7d4674e18.png" alt="image">  low resolution screen. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/142337/">https://habr.com/ru/post/142337/</a></p>
