  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The next generation Mac keeps surprises</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The upcoming new generation of personal computers from Apple may have undergone one of the most significant changes in architecture since the transition from PowerPC processors to Intel. <br><br>  In addition to switching to Intel chips in early 2006, the Cupertino-based company also refused to use its own motherboards that support the central processor in the Mac.  Instead, it has relied on modified versions of Intel chipsets, created according to industry standards for a wide range of PC manufacturers engaged in the development of Intel-compatible systems. <br><br>  While the existing MacBook and MacBook Pro line is unique in that it supports Mac OS X, the architecture of these laptops involves the same components of the mobile platform Intel Santa Rosa, processors and chipsets that are used in Windows-compatible systems of such competitors like Dell and HP.

      But it seems that Apple, which seeks to maintain <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/apple/47071.html">Mac sales growth</a> at a level twice as high as the average in the industry, is again going to isolate the architecture of its personal computers with alternative technology that will give the company an advantage beyond the reach of competitors. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Familiar with these plans, people say that the upcoming Mac generation, headed by a triple notebook with a <a href="http://appleinsider.ru/macbook/615">new design</a> , will not use the Montevina chipset, announced earlier this month as part of the mobile platform Intel Centrino 2. Moreover, these same people assume that the chipset in the new The wave of the Mac will have little to do with Intel at all. <br><br>  What kind of alternative Apple has chosen is still a mystery.  But it is believed that the company Intel, refused to comment on this rumor, will have to provide the Mac manufacturer with a license to use their processors on alternative chipsets. <br><br>  Based on the fact that chipsets are not based on Intel technology, Apple doesn‚Äôt have many options.  The company can return to its principle of Mac times with PowerPC processors, when it also engaged in the production of its own chipsets, aimed at supporting the used CPUs. <br><br>  As another option, Apple could make a deal with another well-known chipset manufacturer, for example, AMD or VIA, which will allow the company to design the next-generation systems with cream technologies from both companies. <br><br>  For example, AMD recently introduced its open platform, Puma, designed for laptops, which also included a new powerful chipset with the potential possibility of using it with competitors Intel.  It should be noted its accelerated Radeon HD 3200 video chip, Hyperflash I / O controller and support for hybrid hard drives with flash memory, which minimizes boot time. <br><br>  The reason for Apple's refusal of Intel chipsets can also be the fear of switching to their new voracious mobile chipsets.  The Mac manufacturer is committed to reducing the size and weight of its laptops, while at the same time increasing battery life and providing new technologies that are not available to competitors. <br><br>  During a recent conference call, Apple Finance Director Peter Oppenheimer <a href="http://appleinsider.ru/analysis/682">said</a> that the company continues to invest in <a href="http://appleinsider.ru/news/685">new technologies</a> that will affect the company's revenue, but leave competitors far behind. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe have several investments in our hands - I can‚Äôt tell you about them yet - with their help we will provide new works of art that will become unique,‚Äù ‚Äã‚ÄãOppenheimer said, ‚Äúas a result, I assume that our profits will be about 30% of income. " <br><br>  Since the release of new Apple laptops will not necessarily coincide with the release of competitors' products based on Centrino 2 standard components, people familiar with the systems of the new generation say that we will hear the official statement of the company not earlier than in 6 or 8 weeks. <br><br>  Recently, Apple stopped supplying its equipment dealers, such as Best Buy, for a period of 2 weeks, which gave rise to rumors of an imminent update.  On the other hand, such Apple actions are most likely related to the season of academic discounts, which usually depletes stocks of equipment in a few weeks, starting in mid-July. <br><br>  <a href="http://appleinsider.ru/">AppleInsider.ru translation</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/31673/">https://habr.com/ru/post/31673/</a></p>
