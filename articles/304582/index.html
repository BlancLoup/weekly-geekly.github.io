      ‚ÄúWe set the task to create a platform where providers and consumers of cloud services could meet, technical specialists would share their experience in using the most advanced technologies, and business representatives discover new opportunities for themselves,‚Äù said Nikita Tsaplin, managing partner of <a href="https://ruvds.com/">RUVDS,</a> during the welcome speech. <br><br>  The forum was held for the first time, its goal was to gather the largest consumers of cloud services and discuss the problems of the industry, especially the introduction of such systems by big business and state-owned companies, as well as possible regulatory mechanisms and self-regulation of participants in this market. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/r5XMxwgkjfY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhghpx92h8fQI8z3hDiSEYgI63id6A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Head of HUAWEI Corporate Client Relations Department, Tony Yan <br><br>  Good afternoon, my name is Tony, I represent Huawei.  In fact, over the past ten years we have been feeling more and more comfortable how much more comfortable we are living with cloud technologies.  Nevertheless, some old question, as it was before, remains, which data is more profitable and convenient for us, more comfortable to leave in our hands, and which data is more profitable for us to put on the public cloud.  How can we do so that the data does not matter where we keep being as protected as possible?  Especially the place where our respected, beloved partners are telecom operators, suddenly they cannot provide all the time a quality communication channel, what will we do with this data if they are needed.  About this, just two months ago, during one meeting with Mr. Nikita (approx. Nikita Tsaplin, managing partner of RU <a href="https://ruvds.com/">VDS</a> ), we discussed, raised the issue, because the issue could not be solved simply, we decided to organize a small round table, a small seminar , gather our friends and make such a discussion.  By communicating more on a particular topic, all of a sudden we will find some balance, we will suddenly find a better option for solving this problem.  Accordingly, we have organized this event today and invited some people from different organizations who will share their experience, their opinions on these issues.  I represent Huawei.  Today our topic, specifically, is that we have something useful for you to organize your cloud.  In the end, you can give your own cloud to other organizations for service, in which case you become some kind of public cloud, relatively speaking.  Either you can use these clauses for yourself in the internal structure, and accordingly you get the benefit.  This is what I want to tell a little bit today. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cad/ca6/498/cadca64982dd42f2ad599b0a373acf60.JPG"><br><br>  - So, a little bit about the company that I represent, suddenly not everyone knows or everyone knows.  Today, the company is the world leader in information technology.  Around the world, we have about 170 thousand employees, of whom about 1,800 work in Russia.  In Russia, in addition to sales, in addition to services, we still have an R &amp; D center in which about 200 talented scientists work.  This is a serious investment.  Today, our solutions for both telecom and IT, for cloud, are widely used around the world by various telecom operators and corporate clients.  Since the main topic today, we are talking about IT and cloud.  Accordingly, we especially want to mention our capabilities.  In this area, we have about 10 thousand employees working on R &amp; D, namely, IT development for server products from cloud, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e40/4c1/475/e404c1475cb54dbfa38b69eac743e64a.JPG"><br><br>  Today, we are the gold partner in the organization Open Stack.  We release the most information in this organization.  And we have implemented the most large-scale corporate cloud for corporate employees in the direction of R &amp; D, which includes about 100 thousand employees, connect there regardless of where they are, on a business trip or not, and the information is maximally protected.  Accordingly, who do we want to be?  We want to be the best partner for our clients, for our market in the area including corporate cloud.  What we have and how we are going to do it.  I want to tell a little about the structure, architecture.  We also have our own virtualization products, called FusionSphere. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ccc/e59/110/ccce59110fb842ec8d409c6e881c6731.JPG"><br><br>  - FusionSphere products can help you to virtualize some of your hardware based on a particular data center, and in which other similar vendors are also likely to work at the moment.  We have a network SDN in which you can connect these independent clouds, which are local, so that these services are transmitted to each other without problems.  We also have a platform that unites these clouds, no matter where they are logically and where they are physically located.  As a result, this platform turns your various clouds, various virtual machines, into some virtual data center.  It is for service.  In the end, your business, as far as cloud, is already service oriented cloud, service oriented data center.  This is what we can do.  We also have a platform that can help you to enter a large amount of information and give you very valuable information.  Is it FusionInsight?  This is a platform for BigData.  Accordingly, this is the complex of what we can do. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f0c/69d/0ef/f0c69d0ef28c420390a6869b3c6e39f9.JPG"><br><br>  Good for you.  One of our esteemed customers, Deutsche Telekom number one in Germany, number two in western Europe, chose us as a strategic partner for the joint launch of their public club, private club, etc.  And we are once again grateful to Mr. Nikita about choosing us, about trusting us.  We also prove to you that your choice is correct, worthy, and we will prove further, as we have proved to Deutsche Telekom.  Accordingly, when we say cloud, first of all you need to understand what brains are, this is the operating system.  The operating system we offer is called FusionSphere OS.  This system can be installed on different pieces of hardware, ours or others, without problems, virtualizing your services to a specific pool. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f44/cc9/602/f44cc96028594dc0b250339d8d91e8e7.JPG"><br><br>  It turns out you finally called Fusion Computing, Fusion Storage, Fusing Network.  This particular resource pool performs a specific task, and this pool then turns it into some technical solution to perform a specific task.  For example, Disoster recovery solution, for example, VDI solution, or Manager One to manage some other platforms simultaneously.  We say that we have to arrange a comfortable life for you in the data center, so that you can switch from many different interfaces and commands to manage the system from a single point.  These are our opportunities and we want to move further. <br>  - Accordingly, Fusion Computing, Fusion Storage, Fusing Network, what gives you? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e9d/fa6/0c0/e9dfa60c04ee4e9082e9930eccf1e7a1.JPG"><br><br>  Fusion Computing gives you maximum calculations.  All the products we are talking about have already been tested in the organization of the spec, which shows that the performance of our products compared to the products of other vendors is all open sources, higher and faster than similar products.  It also shows that one cluster of this product supports 128 servers.  Two times more than similar products from other vendors.  That is, it will also solve the issue of scalability.  A cluster covers as much as possible the glands that you can own, it gives you more options.  Accordingly, this solution successfully helps the national health service of Britain. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/338/6af/f2f/3386aff2f5d5440095ad4c1a5767bec0.JPG"><br><br>  They are served by about one and a half million people working in this organization, through which the local population is served.  It provides the most comfortable growth, for office use, for medical systems, and so on. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f97/fd5/426/f97fd5426f3e4fb0ab05998e3040f35a.JPG"><br><br>  As for Fusion Storage, this is another pool, a storage pool.  Our solutions can transform your servers, in particular the pool, when you end up with a tremendously new level of storage with the maximum possible performance.  Tens of millions of IOPS.  And this system is much scalable, supports about four thousand nodes in comparison with similar products from other vendors.  And the minimum delay, respectively, can help you in your existing servers to have maximum capabilities. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/89e/2b5/229/89e2b5229a834e3584a85bb2eee9bfc6.JPG"><br><br>  Also, the third unit is called Fusing Network, with the help of our own SDN technology, we transform your complex networks inside the data center like a virtual one machine.  You no longer need to manage each element, switch, inside the data center.  You only need to manage one switch, and its brains will help you manage the rest of the elements in the network.  This gives you the most comfortable controllability in your complex and even more complex network, because I am sure that your business grows even further and the system will become more complex, this is a fact, but we want the management process to not get any worse because of this. , and it became easier.  To this end, and our capabilities can help you as much as possible. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dee/8c2/178/dee8c217827d42f7b6c4f0deef61dea1.JPG"><br><br>  Accordingly, what we are talking about now, this system will help to integrate with your existing system, including virtualization, since it is for the same OpenStack architect and the system could help you to virtualize your existing hardware, including.  And in this case, then you can manage the whole system through this FusionSphere system.  This we can do. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b33/6c8/1ae/b336c81ae3df428fa3a152ac81465b47.JPG"><br><br>  In addition, I want to particularly note one technical solution from this system in which this VJI client could turn.  Difference from other manufacturers who have been talking about this for many years as well, that we have something special.  First, all the products that we say VJI is without , this is completely our development.  Accordingly, we are not responsible for specific hardware or software, we are responsible for the quality of the system.  Secondly, the communication channel is not very big if we are talking about office needs, office work.  40 kbps required  To date, any 3G network supports it.  Third, the system supports GPU and 3D.  This was tested many times; literally two months ago, we installed a similar system in one of our esteemed NFTI customers, we held an event in the city center, the communication channel was 2 megabytes.  On it, we drove 3D, everything is fine.  Accordingly, we can repeat and demonstrate and test with you in the future, without any problems.  3D all without problems.  And in the end, it supports not only our hardware and hardware and hardware from other vendors, and by default we are always open to dialogue. <br><br>  In the end, we give maximum comfort for managing local computing instead of the usual classic computers, and at the same time existing your computers, tablets, smartphones, etc.  through the browser can connect to it.  This means that any penny you spent before that, as much as possible saved while you have the most comfortable features, while information security, because all the information is stored in your head and not every disk.  Suddenly infected with a virus, suddenly someone through a flash drive pulls some sensitive data from you, it helps to avoid this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/231/8c3/247/2318c324784a4d5eaa7ac0db443d4aab.JPG"><br><br>  - In addition to the operating system, I would like a little lower, it is the operating system with our hardware that would help you even easier to organize your cloud.  There are two options.  The first option is Scale-up, the second is Scale-out.  Scale-up means that we use our software together with our FusionCube as single cabinets.  A bistro will help you to arrange your cloud, namely the local corporate cloud, including, which allows you to manage much easier and quickly in the conditions that you need.  It has various databases, for example document flow.  Another Scale-out option is based on our various blade servers, which give you more flexible scalability, step by step.  Today, you need an additional one server, you connect there, tomorrow your data becomes larger, you additionally connect.  One way or another.  Accordingly, the difference between what is special in this version may be useful to you.  A little bit about FusionCube.  All products, once again, have been tested on our customers many times, including international organizations.  I would also like to especially note this test, they conducted a telephone communication operator of world level.  They tested our FusionCube product and recognized how serious this piece of hardware is.  Especially in comparison with other vendors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/276/3f8/08d/2763f808d80e41489dd7ee1d1337492c.JPG"><br><br>  This data is not from us, it is really the results of their testing.  If in this system we install software and install databases such as SAP, Oracle, what do we get? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/203/079/c31/203079c31c034aa9b6eff85cbcde1aaf.JPG"><br><br>  We get the colossal most powerful SAP in the world.  This is recognized, including SAP, not what we came up with.  Accordingly, if you have a lot of calculations going on, serious large databases, imagine how our system could help, get the necessary report. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8e0/241/432/8e02414320a24b36a0d890bf81a79ab0.JPG"><br><br>  And this system helps a great organization such as BMI, a company from Spain that provides exchange services for the local market.  I think you can imagine how their data turnover occurs every second, and we help them well to carry out their tasks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/766/e4f/a55/766e4fa5543e42b8b61f883f59a3aaa6.JPG"><br><br>  - A little about Scale-out solution for cloud.  In addition to rack, except for blade servers, today I want to particularly note the new products that we recently released, these are server modules.  It is 4-unit, immediately supports 4 to 6 blades.  It saves space.  We understand that every place inside, every unit inside the data center is expensive.  Absolutely understand about saving space, while it gives you the ability to centrally manage a large number of servers.  If your data center has a certain number of switches, you no longer need to configure the number of switches.  This savings and your extra money.  We try to save every penny you have been spending up to this point.  Save what you have so that they can work with our system, while we try no matter how physically difficult it is, we make it so that you are logically comfortable and comfortable so that you can control through one interface.  This is our logic, these are our goals, and indeed we are moving towards this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9db/644/6de/9db6446de0104f6cb1d16510243e559d.JPG"><br><br>  In fact, this is a typical pattern for many organizations.  So it is, because the organization was not created today or yesterday, but many years ago from different situations, unfortunately, yes, the server room is such, for example, basically it looks like this.  What in this case will be useful to you during the upgrade?  We have such a solution of cabinets called IDS500. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/32f/f05/095/32ff05095b9042bb9293cad314889acd.JPG"><br><br>  In one locker, an initially defined product is integrated with a battery, a UPS, and most importantly, some ECC500 monitoring devices, it will promptly inform the administrator what is happening inside the data center.  Pressure, temperature, humidity, etc.  Plus, we have another solution as a modular data center, which allows you to organize hot and cold corridors to increase energy efficiency.  Accordingly, it is also worth recalling such good UPS products that support stable operation. <br>  These are different types of products, ranging from 1 kW, 20 kW to 800 kW for one cabinet.  Very powerful enough, good.  And most importantly, with a load of 20%, their efficiency is already 90%.  13% higher than similar products from other vendors.  And these control modules can work with batteries from other manufacturers.  We say again, it can support, including your existing batteries, you do not need to throw it away, we give you an additional opportunity for freedom of choice, especially some elements in the future tense.  This is a convenience. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/98a/4c9/a2e/98a4c9a2ece84639945d6fc9cfbc90ee.JPG"><br><br>  Corresponding to what we are talking about, the question probably arose - how does a server exist?  For service and storage, we give a free 3 year warranty.  The next business day we ship to your warehouse.  The network part is 1 year free.  Of course, if you need hot swaps or instead of a 3, 5 year warranty, please. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4f3/d20/a26/4f3d20a26b204b2e8871a64ce2c0d5eb.JPG"><br><br>  Today‚Äôs solutions we have listed are widely used in such important organizations in Russia as the Central Bank, Sberbank, VTB, the administration of St. Petersburg, the administration of Moscow, Gazprom, Rosneft, and so on.  Accordingly, what we are talking about now is verified not only at the global level, but including Russian clients, and we will prove further.  As a result, what you get.  Step by step, we will help you to solve small tasks, step by step, we will work with a partner, because we interact only through a partner, and together with your partner we form our own technical standards for you, if you need.  And we, with a partner, are already for you not as product suppliers, but as quality work partners in your system.  There was a problem, you have a single person, a responsible person, a reliable person who will perform a complex task for you. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/304582/">https://habr.com/ru/post/304582/</a></p>
