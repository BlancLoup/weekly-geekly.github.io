For some reason, many of my familiar experts have not even heard about him, and about the opportunities that he gives to start-up teams. <br><br>  A year ago I lived in Ufa and planned to create <a href="http://chelny.itpark-kazan.ru/node/115">my own software</a> (online designer of real and virtual quests).  Today, our company is a resident of an IT park in Naberezhnye Chelny, we developed a prototype of the application, and got into the finals of several federal and international competitions, winning 800 thousand rubles on the START science program.  Moreover, our partners are already making money using our application.  A considerable share of our small success today is obtained thanks to the titanic work of the guys from Kazan and Chelny, who made the IT-park project a reality. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0d5/ad4/7a9/0d5ad47a983be863e9b2539556d2d04e.jpg">

      <b>A lot of photos!</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  2 years ago, in a short time (and in Tatarstan, they are able to build quickly) in Kazan, the only technopark in Russia was created, specializing exclusively in information technology. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Video Guide to the Kazan IT-Park</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  from the former director of the IT-park, and now the director for the development of the fund Runa Capital, Ramil Ibrahimov: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/kO50I90MRPc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500002,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiMDKRG2cHETm0_Mtfj1g38G1DmYw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></div></div><br>  A year after the opening, the IT park was filled to capacity, and construction began on the second site of Kazan IT Park, which has become even bigger and cooler.  <a href="http://chelny.itpark-kazan.ru/">The IT park in Chelny</a> is a former long-term construction project where the placement of the computing center of Kamaz OJSC was planned.  By the way, the huge plant itself is located right behind the IT-park, and the helipad is located nearby. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3ab/93a/03c/3ab93a03c33ab9e95e718a4537318a2e.jpg"><br><br>  In 2012, the Startup-Sabantuy expedition traveled through the major cities of the Volga region to conduct master classes as part of a startup school. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1ce/c61/cb9/1cec61cb939d2730ce61e5b25c2d0c8c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/91f/65b/569/91f65b56984b1ab61440045af1be9b76.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3e5/40d/513/3e540d513de7da7f5f6b651e98aa18e7.jpg"><br><br>  Later, the winners and many finalists of Startup-Sabantuy became the first residents of the IT park in Chelny.  And I was among them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/221/6c5/4a9/2216c54a9fee5bc5eab4b5e2d21b1c42.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ec0/cf4/891/ec0cf489163cce0d1bf8d6a5622859f4.jpg"><br><br>  IT-park has been repeatedly called the best technopark of Russia.  Today, more than 130 representatives of small and medium-sized IT-business and residents of a business incubator from 18 cities of Russia work here.  Among the residents are companies operating globally.  For example, ‚ÄúSPRUT‚Äù is a system developer in the field of preproduction automation.  Their main product - SprutCAM software - is used in 45 countries. <br><br>  Inside the Chelny IT Park is not very different from its elder brother from Kazan.  The main hall looks breathtakingly: LED poles, video lenses from projectors on the glass, behind which you can see the server. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6ef/e25/e65/6efe25e65f607cb410400baa768d5b2c.jpg"><br><br>  The access control system is centralized, each door is equipped with NFC and a fingerprint scanner.  Guests are issued cards that must be thrown into the turnstile upon exit.  Each entry and exit is taken into account, so it is impossible to skip someone through their pass or imprint imperceptibly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/678/db3/233/678db3233562e07a1f90eaa85956447e.jpg"><br><br>  View from the panoramic elevator to the atrium with a glass roof: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d5c/c4c/079/d5cc4c0799f64078724cd88baea62681.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fd3/cda/9fc/fd3cda9fc631f11d26c3af87ec12e357.jpg"><br><br>  In rented offices - already familiar open space. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/510/539/9bd/5105399bddea9e02499e55370467b37e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7f7/7e9/56d/7f77e956d4f91cc400c8302700d574fb.jpg"><br><br>  The main pride of the IT-park is a huge business incubator and coworking for 240 jobs! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f44/93a/7fb/f4493a7fbc68226d255a4a58f885c59d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9db/3fd/fb4/9db3fdfb44a6e08e23669b5a22944174.jpg"><br><br>  Informal meeting with ottomans, plasma and Xbox. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bba/3f1/bed/bba3f1bedb0feb3b7f4f2ac3f4f94960.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/147/0e0/fcf/1470e0fcf4c8ec5de021a46f7eb8cba5.jpg"><br><br>  Each cube, as we call the offices of the incubator, is given for 2 projects.  Some guys team up and work together with a large team on several projects. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/366/d69/269/366d69269e1e7bf7dce2c22cbf0abcf0.jpg"><br><br>  Now the incubator is mostly filled, but not all new residents are ready to immediately drop everything and come to a foreign city to develop their startup. <br><br>  At the other end of the incubator we have a horizontal bar and a tennis table, where small tournaments take place every day. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/651/92b/9d2/65192b9d26cd98e54d7591c668ac0df2.jpg"><br><br>  And on a special white wall, famous and successful people write their farewell to residents. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6f6/d54/f9c/6f6d54f9cc9e1372d43356a11dcca242.jpg"><br><br>  Building B contains: <br><br>  Canteen <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/43c/46a/2aa/43c46a2aa74163cafa37e93d49f59e21.jpg"><br><br>  Conference hall <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e16/4a4/201/e164a42016fed8b86f80ae68c5219e44.jpg"><br><br>  Press room <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/587/2e1/a0e/5872e1a0e79fc84587adab2a66057daa.jpg"><br><br>  Meeting rooms (by the way, free for residents of the incubator) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f78/f13/615/f78f1361502186d6107acddcf7555540.jpg"><br><br>  IT-park does not distribute money as accelerators and, moreover, does not appropriate a share in the company.  The resident pays 6000 rubles a month for business incubation services, and receives accounting, personnel and legal services, assistance from project managers, regular visits of investors and experts, and 3 fully equipped workplaces.  It is worth noting your own mini-exchange of freelancers in coworking on the floor below (you can personally go down and push the executor to handle), as well as a free server for residents in the data center of Kazan IT Park. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a81/611/fa0/a81611fa08f2596c45e2de5787b761d9.jpg"><br><br>  But for me, perhaps the most important was the party, in which every project struggles to stop being a start-up and become a real business.  According to the experience of Kazan IT-Park, one can say that many succeed!  Now residents of the IT-incubator Chelny have attracted a total of $ 2.2 million in investments from venture funds and private investors and won grants worth more than 12 million rubles from federal and republican funds. <br><br>  Our project made over the last six months more than 20 applications and more than 30 performances before we first achieved the first serious results: 2nd place in the international competition Aeroflot - for the on-board entertainment system (joint development of several IT-park projects) and 800 thousand rubles from Bortnik Fund. <br><br>  I wish everyone who is only dreaming or has already started his own business in the field of information technology, to be persistent and realize his dream.  You can also try to become residents of the IT business incubator, so that your goal may become closer. <br><br>  In the near future, the IT-park holds a new <a href="http://startupsabantuy.com/">Startup-Sabantuy</a> in the cities: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/979/b82/552/979b82552b12635c544fc6f6ada00dbc.jpg"><br><br>  This is a great opportunity to develop your startup, find partners, mentors, investors, join our friendly company and ‚Äúshoot‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/aea/41d/6f7/aea41d6f717214ed7321abcde419d236.jpg"><br><br>  See you later! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/176153/">https://habr.com/ru/post/176153/</a></p>
