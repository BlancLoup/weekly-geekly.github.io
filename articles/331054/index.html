    <h3>  Machine learning in Zen </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/70e/5a9/309/70e5a93094fc408f8586da36fb14af13.png" alt="image"><br>  The first speakers will be speakers from Yandex: Evgeny Sokolov and Dmitry Ushanov.  Evgeny is the head of the quality group for recommendations and content analysis of Yandex. Dzen.  Dmitry is a senior developer of the Zen service, and before that he was engaged in the development of the linguistic components of the search: search engine witches and object answers. <br><br>  Yandex.Den is a personal recommendation service that aggregates news and media content from a large number of sites, and also allows authors to publish directly to the platform.  At all stages of building recommendations, from collecting content and filtering to ranking, machine learning is used.  In recommender algorithms, two main types of signals are used: user feedback and semantic proximity of content.  The speakers will analyze several unusual examples of taking these signals into account: how to use models with hidden variables for texts in matrix expansions and how to properly form factors based on them;  how to account for user clicks using sports rating systems;  how to combine explicit and implicit user feedback. <br><br><h3>  Recommendations in OZON.ru </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/2fb/f0f/ed8/2fbf0fed86f644e3babd06d00fb0e26f.png" alt="image"><br>  Leading analyst at OZON.ru Ksenia Boksha, without going too hard in mathematics, will talk about the various types of recommendations that the marketplace provides to its users: related products, accessories, bundles, personal recommendations, recommended categories of products for queries, recommended search queries, recommendations in the basket.  In addition, from the report you will learn about the technology stack that the team uses, as well as about the nearest plans. <br><br><h3>  What tasks solves the team recommendations in Avito </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/8a2/fb8/736/8a2fb8736cf8453588bf8fa598c1d6fb.png" alt="image"><br>  At one of the past meetings, the head of the recommendations unit Vasiliy Leksin <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D3MEe5IzBJk4">already told</a> that under the hood, the recommendations in Avito.  This time, together with analyst Mikhail Kamenshchikov, they will talk about what tasks the unit of recommendations solves, why there was a competition to build an advisory model, what results they expected to get at the end of the competition, what worked out and what didn't.  In addition, they will share their experience of participating in the <a href="http://2017.recsyschallenge.com/">RecSys Challenge 2017</a> . <br><br><h2>  Competition </h2><br>  Next, we will proceed to summarizing the <a href="http://dataring.ru/competitions/avito-recommendations/">competition</a> , award the winners and ask them to tell some details about their approaches and decisions. <br><br>  A few words about the contest itself.  In this dating, participants were asked to build their recommendation system for ads based on an activity history of about 600,000 users within 6 days.  After receiving the training sample, participants had to predict events of user interaction with the ad, which could be of 4 types: click on the ad, send a message to the seller, add the ad to favorites and contact the seller.  Correct predictions of events of different types had different weight. <br>  The final results of the competition have already been published on the portal <a href="http://dataring.ru/competitions/avito-recommendations/leaderboard/">DataRing.ru</a> , and the decisions of the winners are validated. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/720/aae/27f/720aae27f17a416ba4a9ac6fd6064129.png" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  check in </h3><br>  In order to get to the meeting, you need to <b><a href="https://avitotech.timepad.ru/event/509717/">register</a> and get confirmation</b> .
