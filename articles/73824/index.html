(difficult to write literary) In short, simply helped: <br><br>  a) Make a new, productive acquaintance; <br>  b) Make a Honda CR-V from the VAZ-2106 (allegory);  make flying from a slow site; <br>  c) To get acquainted with the process of moving a project from shared hosting to VPS hosting. <br><br>  ... I decided, therefore, to reanimate somehow a site hosted on a shared hosting by MasterHost, which was ‚Äúblown away‚Äù already with 20 users online due to exceeding the permissible load on the server percent.  Initially I thought initially to make a choice in favor of <b><a href="http://antonvolkov.habrahabr.ru/blog/71729/">removing the VDS</a></b> , but so that with someone for two or three.  To my surprise, I received the following comment from the user <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/andrey_rogovsky/" class="user_link">Andrey_Rogovsky</a> in the topic:

      <i>I am optimizing for high loads and I have my own server under VPS, with free space.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>With pleasure I will take you to my VPS for free, and I will try to correct the situation with LiveStreet with competent settings.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Interested in?</i>  <i>Write in habraposhta!</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <i>So, point ‚Äúa‚Äù - acquaintance with Andrey took place.</i> <br><br>  Further corresponded in a pm.  The mysterious word ‚Äúhabraeffect‚Äù, which was hitherto unknown to me, was explained to me in relation to the fact that the claimed for the UPU test Andrei <i>holds habraeffects</i> . <br><br>  I decided why not try and wrote to Andrew.  I ask what, they say, how and why, why do you agree to own for free, etc. He explained that, in principle, he provides his VPS on a commercial basis and / or offers quality tuning, and that he will want me for a month for the sake of test-drive 'but.  I first refused, thinking, but what for I need it?  Whether it will be good or bad for him, but the cost turned out to be higher than planned for me, and in a month he will ‚Äúask‚Äù me anyway.  But in the evening of the same (or the next, I don‚Äôt remember already) day, I thought: ‚ÄúOne hell, I don‚Äôt have experience migrating a site to another hosting, much less to VPS.  I turn to him.  Well, it won't be worth anything to me anyway! ‚Äù  And turned. <br><br>  Andrei immediately sent me the passwords to the server, the base, and, he says, pour his goods there.  I flooded.  He rolled up a dump of the base and ... VUA-LA - at such a-ah address my site is spinning on its UPU.  <u>BUT how he spun</u> !!!  It was clearly palpable just as when I, with the VAZ 2106, moved into a brand new Honda CR-V.  And all because a) of course, completely different resources were at my disposal, and b) right there, Andrei and I changed the file cache (another one on shared hosting is not supported) to a memory cache!  Mum dear, time in 3 precisely all became faster to fly. <br><br>  <i>Item "b" was solemnly performed.</i> <br><br>  Well, I think, then we must move to him right with the domain name, i.e.  drove off the master.  Andrew introduced me to <a href="http://winscp.net/">WinSCP</a> - before that, Total Commander used it, but now it‚Äôs like this program ... I downloaded the VPS site.  Meanwhile, Andrew something shaman there, the site for that IP then worked, then no, but in the end, Andrew wrote: ‚ÄúEverything, prepared the site for the move, change the server‚Äôs IP address from Masterhost to mine in the DNS editor‚Äù. <br><br>  On Saturday evening, when the traffic on my already sparsely visited site is minimal (yes, then Russia-Germany also played :-)) changed the IP address and, by a miracle, instantly picked up a new address DNS servers and people already began to fall on the same site, but much faster.  Cool. <br><br>  <i>Item "in" is made.</i> <br><br>  Further, Andrei and I continually optimized performance.  More precisely, he himself, and I, as if in a chair with popcorn, watched as the site flies and flies into the stratosphere.  It is a pity that soon, probably, I will move from Andrei to, it seems, the hosting chosen by RBC, but I thank him a lot now saying THANK YOU.  For the settings of the VPS (well, or ‚Äúiron‚Äù servers) I will now turn to him for quite reasonable money.  Here it is. <br><br>  ... On Wednesday, if anyone saw the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/livestreet/73604/">topic</a> on Habr√© with a call to help, the <a href="http://livestreet.ru/">LiveStreet</a> community (on this engine, my site works) in the person of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/ort/" class="user_link">ort</a> 'a and all volunteers <a href="http://livestreet.ru/blog/dev_livestreet/2925.html">tested the</a> performance of the chat.  According to the link given earlier, the results of the test are described: LS was kept, as well as VPS from RBC hosting, but they got rid of it, as a result, with 220 people online due to some kind of error in the chat!  :))) <br><br>  In a type both banal curiosity, and practical interest, I dare to ask you already, colleagues: if it is pertinent from my side, and it is not difficult for you, then we can jointly test this very <i><b>effect</b></i> , and with me in <b>UPD</b> post server load graphs "before and after".  <b>Delicious: a</b> reference to <a href="http://www.avtoturistu.ru/munin/localdomain/localhost.localdomain.html">monitoring server performance</a> !  And already on the basis of these data, it will be possible to see firsthand whether it has withstood or not (I think it will withstand 200 online).  So, if (crossed) do not zaminusyut me, lean on: <h4>  <a href="http://www.avtoturistu.ru/">www.avtoturistu.ru</a> </h4>  (and let him rest in peace, hehe) ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/73824/">https://habr.com/ru/post/73824/</a></p>
