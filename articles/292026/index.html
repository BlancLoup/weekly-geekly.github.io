Whatever plans you have for the next few months, we know that you will find a place for an interesting movie.  That is why today we have compiled for you a selection of wonderful documentaries about the business.  Useful and very interesting.  In the process of compiling the material forcibly films were paused! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/403/f4b/c30/403f4bc30e464f17aaf47166a5aba788.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  <font color="#e41825">1. Jiro's dreams of sushi // Jiro Dreams of Sushi, USA, 2011</font> <br></h4><h6>  A film that will inspire you to long-term love with your business, your profession.  The film is that skill is always above all.  About how a tiny Japanese restaurant received three Michelin stars.  Three tables, ten seats and one unique chef. <br><br>  You know, there is such a joke among gourmets: if you go somewhere, where not far (in the city) there is a restaurant with one Michelin star - take a look at it for curiosity, if there is somewhere within 500 km or in the neighboring state with two Michelin stars - go there.  But for a restaurant with three Michelin stars, it is worth flying to the other end of the world.

      The film can be viewed <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DGYN7p8dvr64">here</a> . </h6><br><br><h4>  <font color="#e41825">2. Brick by Brick: Inside Lego</font> <br></h4><h6>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãone dane.  And now the richest company that makes toys.  Lego.  Yes, we know that these are not just toys, but a real tool for building cities, developing imagination and so on. <br><br>  105 000 elements of new designers are released every minute.  80 parts per person.  David Beckham gathered Tower Bridge ... And we want it too! <br><br>  A wonderful film that proves that each of us can create something unique and amazing if we always remain a little child. <br><br>  And yet, you know what, as the founder of ‚ÄúLego‚Äù said: ‚ÄúPlay well‚Äù. <br><br>  Watch this <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/b/4a56e664-4427-49fc-82fb-2d5e4a6f4502">movie</a> . </h6><br><br><h4>  <font color="#e41825">3. Joan Rivers: Creation // Joan Rivers: A Piece of Work, USA, 2010</font> <br></h4><h6>  The film will be harder to find than the rest.  But if you still decide to watch it, then we are sure you will not regret it. <br><br>  This is a documentary about the stand-up comedian, producer, TV host, Joan Rivers.  For decades she stands and causes genuine laughter to all who hear it.  Huge stocks of jokes (see a huge chest of drawers, which contains all of her jokes for all the time of performances).  But what is it like to be on stage forever?  This is the most truthful film about show business and the consequences of its overdose.  Everything is not as simple as it seems to us. <br><br>  In every joke there is some joke, you yourself know. <br><br>  Watch for those who are willing to see not only the cover / wrap, but also the content is ready to read confidently and sympathetically. </h6><br><br><h4>  <font color="#e41825">4. Materialization // Objectified, UK, 2009</font> <br></h4><h6>  Does a person live in the world of things or are things part of the world of man?  The answer to this question is more and more lost, because we are already surrounded by a huge number of gadgets, devices to facilitate and simplify life, amenities - everything.  Somewhere we lost our skins and the desire to just survive. <br><br>  This independent documentary film tells about the industrial production of mass items.  Remember your toothbrush?  Perhaps she also appears there.  The creative process of creating products of mass consumption: is there a place for the artist and, more importantly, a person in his biological sense? <br><br>  Look for a movie on the web on Russian sites.  He is definitely there. </h6><br><br><h4>  <font color="#e41825">5. Something Ventured, USA, 2011</font> <br></h4><h6>  Venture investments, capitalization ... If you are interested in changing the market and how the US economy was rebuilt in the 20th century, we advise you to watch this movie.  It tells about how the giants Apple, Intel and others appeared and grew.  You will learn everything first-hand: the venture capitalists of the 60s, 70s, 80s will tell all the details and share their experiences. <br><br>  This picture has been nominated for an Emmy. <br><br>  The film can be viewed <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DTVrfQIafeYI">here</a> . </h6><br><br><h4>  <font color="#e41825">6. Enron: the smartest guys in this room // Enron: The Smartest Guys in The Room, 2005, USA</font> <br></h4><h6>  Once upon a time there was an energy company Enron.  Earned a lot of money and not sad at all.  And then it turned out that the company‚Äôs accountants were the smartest. <br><br>  You probably have not heard of the Enron scandal?  This is the largest corruption collapse, the largest financial fraud in US history.  And the whole movie is dedicated to the solution.  The film crew found the participants of the scandal and talked with them, trying to find out the causes of the incident. <br><br>  An incredibly exciting film about how corporations are crumbling and how deception is being performed at this level.  In practice, do not use only! <br><br>  The film is available for viewing on the web.  Look for! </h6></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292026/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292026/</a></p>
