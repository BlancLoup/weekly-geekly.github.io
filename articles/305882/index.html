      The first thing to remember at this level: the scope of technical directors includes many aspects.  For example, in small companies, their responsibilities often correspond to the position of a software administrator or a senior developer.  In such a situation, tools that make an impression on them can be found in cheat codes to <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/karera/proydi-tekhnicheskoe-sobesedovanie-uroven-2/">level 2</a> and <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/karera/proydi-tekhnicheskoe-sobesedovanie-uroven-3/">level 3</a> . <br><br>  In addition, in some firms, meeting with such a manager is a formal presentation procedure and a brief conversation about the company and its objectives. <br><br>  But now let's proceed from the assumption that you have reached the interview with the ‚Äúclassical‚Äù director.  He is a member of the executive committee who reports to the general director or board of directors, who has deep knowledge and experience in doing business, finances and creating a trademark.  This person is really the top manager. <br><br>  In this case, in any way you need to show your interest and willingness to contribute to the company's innovative development, the macrostrategy.  And also to demonstrate that the relationship between departments and <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/potryasayushchaya-produktivnost-5-sposobov-povysheniya-komandnoy-proizvoditelnosti/">team relationships</a> are extremely important to you. <br><br>  Given the above, you should remember a few more cheat codes before entering the technical director's office. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">You may not have to talk on technical topics for long.</font> </h2><br>  The director may ask you some standard technical questions to quickly verify your qualifications.  By the time you crossed the threshold of his office, your technical abilities were already carefully evaluated by other team members. <br><br>  Accordingly, a general idea of ‚Äã‚Äãyour technical training should be obtained relatively quickly without much effort on both sides.  But still prepare for detailed coverage of issues if necessary. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Keep talking to topics beyond software development.</font> </h2><br>  The technical director can ask deceptively general questions that have no connection with the development of programs in order to verify your compliance with the vacancy. <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúAssuming that they have the skills necessary for this job, I try to talk about topics not related to software development as much as possible,‚Äù said Greg Meyer, Technical Director of Strategic Consulting Technologies, LLC in Maryland.  ‚ÄúThe very question‚Äú Who do you prefer: Ravens or Redskins? ‚ÄùIs of great value.  But it‚Äôs not the answer that matters, but the entire subsequent dialogue, because it allows you to understand the degree of accessibility (can you contact the employee by phone or email during his absence in the office) and the value system ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  Similarly, other technical directors may ask situational questions.  For example, how applicants overcame the <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/kak-stat-vynoslivym-8-shagov-k-uspekhu-naperekor-slozhnostyam/">serious difficulties</a> in their lives.  It helps to see how they found ways to deal with the obstacles. <br><br>  Of course, candidates who claim that they have never had difficult problems are left without attention. <br><br>  Therefore, do not allow yourself to be lulled by a false sense of security and use even the simplest questions as a platform to describe yourself as an applicant, fully relevant to this job. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Express the desire to grow with the company</font> </h2><br>  Remember that other classical areas of responsibility of technical directors are determining the direction of work of software creators, providing them with the tools to <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/dva-slova-kotorye-privedut-vas-k-uspekhu-i-schastyu/">achieve success</a> , and, at the same time, protecting the team from any manifestations of negativity from superiors. <br><br>  In this regard, it is not worthwhile to demonstrate to the director that your forces will be dispersed on the fulfillment of too many tasks that are beyond the competence of the proposed position.  This will be a warning to him, warning of the possibility of facing the negative consequences of poor performance and spontaneous turnover of personnel. <br><br>  <b>Demonstrate ability to adapt quickly.</b>  Consider that the technical director actually manages the technical strategy of the company.  Therefore, he / she will look for developers who are able to create new paths for advancement, using methods and technologies, the introduction of which should lead to growth and development. <br><br>  Therefore, if you make an impression of a person who has strong convictions, is not inclined to change and is interested in working with a limited set of tools, you are more likely to find yourself behind candidates who have the ability and desire to apply any means and strategies proposed by management. <br><br>  <b>Ask non-programming questions.</b>  Many development candidates seem to be limited programmers who can create programs based only on technical requirements.  However, the technical director will be impressed by those who go beyond the concepts of simple programming and show themselves to be true software developers, able to analyze and optimize not only technical, but also commercial requirements. <br><br>  Thus, being interested in issues related to the specifics of the technology used in the arsenal of the company and with personnel management systems, software versions, automated testing and internationalization, you show yourself not only a valuable employee for the company's technical niche, but also a serious player who can contribute to the overall the success of the company. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Conclusion</font> </h2><br>  Remember that each recruitment process has its own characteristics.  Different organizations join their ranks with different professionals, at times demanding candidates to meet with other employees: a portfolio manager, a lawyer or the general director. <br><br>  On the other hand, some interviews - especially in small companies with a limited number of staff - may be shorter, because the person hiring an employee combines the duties of technical director, software administrator and chief developer. <br><br>  In addition, some organizations - financial, legal - may have more stringent requirements for behavior and appearance.  They select candidates who have not only extensive experience in technical issues and <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/sposob-resheniya-problem-nulevoy-vopros/">problem solving</a> , but also a glossy face, always well-groomed hair and polished shoes. <br><br>  Accordingly, make sure that you combine the general useful recommendations with your own common sense and persistent searches. <br><br>  PS We recommend another article on the topic - <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/ezhednevnye-ritualy-chteniya-kotorye-povysyat-vashu-produktivnost/">Daily reading rituals that will increase your productivity</a> . <br><br>  Translated by Vyacheslav Davidenko, founder of <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/">MBA Consult</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/305882/">https://habr.com/ru/post/305882/</a></p>
