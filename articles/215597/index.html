And what information technology can exist at all?  And which of them are expedient?  This is not an article, but only an essay of a broad image, the meaning of which is an attempt to tune the reader to a certain critical mode of evaluation of modern IT, in general, abounding in bold fonts, the article is practically nothing and, all the more, not about commerce :) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Adjustment and coordination of coordinates </h4><br><ol><li>  We can assume that information will not exist for us without an environment, i.e.  let's look at the <b>media</b> at once. <br></li><li>  I am not interested in information that exists only hypothetically - now in society there is a lot of talk about the information field, higher intelligence and other undocumented possibilities.  The article does not talk about such things - I want to consider the <b>specific processes</b> with which a person consciously deals in practice. </li></ol><br>  Usually in this place in textbooks you can expect a list of all the senses, but this is not the article that is written for certification in the RAS - we assume that the obvious things are clear to everyone :) <br><br>  But something is still better to agree in advance, so as not to get entangled in the three pines.  In programming, it is assumed that <b>information is</b> transmitted from <b>node</b> to node by <b>threads</b> that have any <b>speed</b> .  The concept of speed in everyday life is confused between the speed of movement of data in the environment (for example, the speed of light) and the speed of reception and transmission (bandwidth, for example, bits per second).  Streams are transmitted over communication <b>channels</b> .  I will already summarize the parameters of channels, streams, information, nodes of its processing, etc., to the <b>parameters of the environment</b> .  For example, we can say that we will consider all the parameters of the Internet entirely with all its processors, satellites, retirees and other vulnerabilities :)

    <h4>  Promise </h4><br>  Now in the case.  No need to look at the wires separately from the data and processing nodes, and the power of the Internet will be evaluated in terabytes per second, which is inadequate to the system formulation of the problem, then we will speak about information systems in general. <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  <b><i>Any information technology is always limited by the parameters of the information environment.</i></b> </td></tr></tbody></table>  The next item, I will try to argue that any information technology is always limited by the parameters of the information environment (material carrier).  Surely this is an obvious fact.  Let's try to see how the efficiency of the environment is not obvious and how low it is in our time.  Efficiency can be understood as the ratio of traffic volumes to the potential of the environment.  Here the <b>signal-to</b> -noise ratio pops up, and simple (note aut.: N.), And the most key: <b>connectivity of nodes</b> .  The trick here is that in the real world there are many types of nodes with different plans.  For example, in terms of the ezernta connectivity is carried out at distances of up to hundreds of meters, in terms of IP - there is almost complete connectivity on the Internet, except for cases when incomplete connections like ‚Äúbehind NAT‚Äù or ‚ÄúRostelecom‚Äù are obtained, and in terms of organic, we must look at the nodes - human personality. <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  <i><b>There are many types of different plan nodes in the real world.</b></i> </td></tr></tbody></table>  How can one formulate the potential and <b>capabilities of information technology</b> ?  Let's make a selection of useful characteristics of such technologies, of course we will focus on the stage of receiving data by the node (end user): <br><ol><li>  <b>timeliness</b> of information delivery, <br></li><li>  <b>utility</b> - compliance of the received information with the necessary information, <br></li><li>  compactness ( <b>density</b> ) - the speed of perception of a logical data block (A.P. Chekhov: ‚Äúbrevity is the sister of talent‚Äù), <br></li><li>  <b>orderliness</b> - the procedure for obtaining in accordance with priorities and relevance, <br></li><li>  <b>credibility</b> - the quality and success of decisions made depends on this parameter <br></li><li>  internal <b>consistency</b> - as it grows, the feasibility of the technology is lost <br></li><li>  <b>the complexity</b> required to obtain information with the required parameters (cost in all senses), <br></li><li>  <b>the limitations of the</b> many available information, <br></li><li>  data stream <b>quality</b> (data loss, latency) <br></li><li>  <b>reliability</b> <br></li><li>  etc. </li></ol><br>  After reading this list and evaluating each line, I begin to think that we live in the Stone Age - now it‚Äôs hard to remember a service that would answer all these points to a great extent, but there is an example and I‚Äôll give it - this is a Yandex cork.  If information technologies are considered to be a tool, and its expediency is the delivery of useful information to a <b>decision maker</b> , then it is very easy to evaluate the effectiveness of IT - it should really change people's social behavior.  For example, the operation of the Yandex Yandex mobile Internet service leads to an even distribution of vehicle downtime over a large part of the metropolis, i.e.  there is an alignment of traffic jams in all detours in the neighborhood. <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  <i><b>The effectiveness of any information technology is very easy to assess - it should really optimize the decision-making process.</b></i> </td></tr></tbody></table>  What can determine the effectiveness - the ability to influence people's decision-making.  More efficient is the flow of data that more successfully optimizes the decision-making process.  And here we come to the infinity, which threatens the theme of this daring essay.  All people are constantly making decisions in all possible areas of life.  Now we can see <b>narrow high-performance</b> services (Yandex traffic jams) and <b>wide inefficient</b> (social networks) in the whole set, but the real goal of every programmer should be wide high-performance technologies.  If you think that this requires computational power higher than that of Google, then I do not think so.  <u>I will only hint at low connectivity of nodes.</u> <br><br>  If while reading you were worth a scale image and you were thinking about something, you can re-read the document anew and again, top-down and bottom-up and pay attention to the key concepts over and over again, because  in the document, a rather large number of them are indicated, but the details are not chewed, and the goal is set high and it is worth understanding as soon as possible. <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  <i><b>The goal of every programmer should be the construction of broad high-performance technologies.</b></i> </td></tr></tbody></table>  <i>By the way, can anyone estimate on fingers what traffic flow was in the USSR in the period 1941-1945?</i>  <i>And what was the signal to noise ratio?</i>  <i>- I'm still talking about the effectiveness of IT in general and radio waves, copper wires and paper in particular :)</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/215597/">https://habr.com/ru/post/215597/</a></p>
