  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tele2 operator has reached billions in debts to start in Moscow</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  ‚ÄúYou can start up in Moscow only once in a lifetime,‚Äù said Konstantin Prokshin, a representative of the telecommunications company T2 RTK Holding ( <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tele2">Tele2</a> brand).  In Russia, the operator has more than 60 regions of presence.  "The [launch] scenario has already been worked out this year in 21 regions," adds Prokshin.  The operator Tele2 officially goes to the capital on October 22.  He prepared for this about a year, and a month ago he launched a large-scale campaign to promote the brand on the local market. <br><br>  Tele2 spent about 25% of the credit line for 16 billion rubles for the construction of infrastructure, opening monobrand salons and advertising campaigns.  The credit line was opened in 2015 by one of the operator‚Äôs shareholders - <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BA_%25D0%2592%25D0%25A2%25D0%2591">VTB Bank</a> .  Under the terms of financing, the project cost limit is 20 billion rubles.  Tele2 borrowed money at a preferential rate of 11%. <br><br>  ‚ÄúBut for the construction of a network in Moscow, we use not only funds from this program, but also other borrowed and own funds,‚Äù stressed Prokshin.  Source RBC said that at the moment the company has spent "several billion rubles, less than ten." <a name="habracut"></a>

      In the second quarter of 2015, its EBITDA increased in relation to the same indicator in 2014 by 9%, to 7.3 billion rubles, revenue - by 7.1%, to 23.6 billion rubles.  Thus, profitability was almost 31%. <br><br><h4>  "The link of perfect quality" </h4><br>  In Moscow, Tele2 launches only 3G and LTE networks, said Dmitry Lopatukhin, director of operations for T2 RTK Holding.  In recent months, Tele2 launches them more than a hundred weekly.  In the development of 3G / 4G networks in Moscow, the operator invests its own funds. <br><br>  According to sources from the Vedomosti newspaper, to the beginning of work, the discounter operator will have a network consisting of about 5 thousand 3G stations and about 2 thousand LTE.  For comparison: at the end of the first half of 2015, over 23 thousand stations of all communication standards, including about 5.7 thousand 4G, operated at <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D0%25A4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD">MegaFon</a> in the metropolitan area. <br><br>  A top manager of a major telecommunications company believes that with the number of base stations voiced by experts and the absence of GSM using radio planning, it is still possible to ‚Äúprovide communication of perfect quality‚Äù.  In Moscow, the majority of subscribers use smartphones, and they work in 3G networks (voice and data) and 4G (data) and do not need a GSM substrate, he said.  In Moscow, 63% of mobile device owners use smartphones. <br><br>  Installing one base station costs the operator 150 thousand rubles, estimates the source of RBC in a telecommunications company.  The cost of the base station itself varies from $ 5 thousand (about 315 thousand rubles at the exchange rate for October 15) to $ 10 thousand (631 thousand rubles), and rent costs 25 thousand rubles a month, he noted.  Thus, the operator spent 750 million rubles only on the installation of base stations. <br><br><h4>  "Walls of Honesty" </h4><br>  The operator has expanded its advertising campaign through all possible channels.  At the end of September he placed ‚Äúgiant banners‚Äù on the facade of one of the towers of the Moscow-City business center, on the building of the Hydroproject Institute, at the intersection of the Third Ring Road and Enthusiasts Highway. <br><br>  In addition, Tele2 launched advertisements on television, radio, on the Internet, as well as in cinemas, universities, on the start page of Wi-Fi in the Moscow metro and other sites. <br><br>  In 2014, advertising expenses for Tele2 increased by 23%, to 3 billion rubles.  But it costs both traditional advertising and all kinds of marketing services.  MegaFon has similar advertising expenses, according to its reports, last year fell by 25% to 6.6 billion rubles, while MTS remained at the same level as last year - about 6.5 billion rubles. <br><br>  To encourage users to purchase SIM cards, Tele2 erected 35 ‚Äúwalls of honesty‚Äù in Moscow - special structures with which you can receive certificates worth 1.2 thousand rubles: they can be used throughout the year (100 rubles per month) only for communication services. <br><br>  A source at RBC <a href="http://www.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/15/10/2015/561e75c49a794713fb9067f7">said</a> that certificates are expected to allow Tele2 to get about 250‚Äì300 thousand active subscribers in the first months. <br><br><h4>  Partners </h4><br>  On Wednesday, October 14, Tele2 signed an agreement with <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D1%258F%25D1%2582%25D1%2591%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2587%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0">Pyaterochka</a> retailer.  In the stores of the network, Tele2 branded sales racks will be installed, where visitors can connect to the operator, replenish the personal account balance and buy phones.  The term of the contract is one year with the possibility of renewal.  The retailer's general director Olga Naumova clarified that Tele2 will have the largest number of points among operators in the framework of cooperation with the network. <br><br>  From the moment of the official launch, it will be possible to purchase Tele2 SIM cards at about 10-11 thousand different retail outlets.  According to Prokshin, the structure of sales of new contracts in Moscow will be similar to the structure of sales throughout Russia: the company plans that about 45-50% of all connections will fall on a mono-brand network. <br><br>  Tele2 contracts will also be sold in <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2595%25D0%25B2%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%258C">the Euroset</a> and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B2%25D1%258F%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9_(%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F)">Svyaznoy</a> stores, in <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AD%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE_(%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%258C_%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2)">Eldorado</a> stores, in the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D1%2587%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25A0%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8">Russian Post</a> branches. <br><br>  A year after the launch of the network, Tele2 can count on 10% of the market in terms of the number of active SIM cards, the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBS">UBS</a> Bank report said. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295460/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295460/</a></p>
