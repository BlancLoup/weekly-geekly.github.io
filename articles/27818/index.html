X / f Teenagers in the Universe, 1974">  Want an employee to work well - feed him.  According to <a href="http://www.rabota.ru/vesti/oprosy/eda_na_rabote.html">statistics a year ago,</a> most people dine right at the desk, eat for their money in the institute's dining room or cook ready-to-cook food in the office kitchen.  Employers often push the problem of food on the employees themselves, only a few companies show social responsibility: they organize their own dining room or pay for meals.  And, in principle, the gray mass of "irresponsible" employers can be understood: to organize food for their own people is not a trivial task. <br><br><br>  I was going to build my own canteen - be kind enough to get licenses / permits / certificates, and also roll out a decent amount every month for the maintenance of the catering department.  Lunch delivery to the office is a dubious pleasure from no less dubious catering companies.  Lunches in a friendly restaurant pall in a month. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The need for a service that would make happy employees, employers, personnel officers, restaurateurs has been hanging in the air for a long time, but no one dares to voice it and, moreover, to satisfy it.  The essence of the service is to provide employers with the infrastructure of electronic payment for meals in a network of friendly restaurants.

    <h2>  How it works? </h2><br><ol><li>  The service organizer agrees with the restaurant that the restaurant accepts payments for a special business lunch on plastic cards of the organizer. </li><li>  The organizer agrees with the bank that the bank provides an electronic payment infrastructure for business lunches and issues branded plastic cards. </li><li>  The organizer agrees with the company that the organizer provides lunch cards to its employees to pay for meals at the network of friendly food outlets. </li><li>  The employee chooses a restaurant for today (‚ÄúSomething Mu-Mu has become boring for me, I‚Äôll go 5 turns‚Ä¶‚Äù), pay for lunch with a lunch card, full and satisfied after a walk in the lunch break, returns to work, <s>waits for him releases Post-Lunch Depression,</s> and continues to accomplish labor exploits. </li></ol><br><h2>  Thinking out loud </h2><br>  ... The organizer, in fact, has extensive ties with restaurateurs and employers, gives them the opportunity to find each other and makes money from it.  These connections are useful to all: restaurateurs receive a large influx of visitors at lunchtime, employers are given a serious tool to stimulate staff, employees have a wide choice of conditional free meals. <br><br>  ... In order for the restaurateur to enter the game, minimal effort will be required: it is enough to have a connected plastic card terminal.  The lunch card can be a non-personalized debit card of any payment infrastructure (MasterCard, VISA).  Technically, payment by lunch card should not differ from the usual electronic payment. <br><br>  ... The control of the target use of funds is carried out on the side of the bank: it will need to adjust the frequency, time and place of use of the card. <br><br>  ... The employer may gradually introduce payment for meals: hand out cards along with bonuses or during regular re-indexing of salaries, include cards in the social package for beginners. <br><br>  ... End users of lunch cards will need a search service for restaurants participating in the food program. <br><br>  ... The cost of a business lunch can be significantly reduced by the efforts of the organizer and the restaurant due to the mass character of the service as a whole. <br><br><h2>  So what is next? </h2><br>  The organizer packs contracts for customers of different levels, segments at prices (from fast-food to premium-restaurants), goes to the regions / neighboring / far-abroad countries with infrastructure services for local and business travelers.  Actively looking for new customers among employers, expanding the network of friendly restaurants. <br><br><h2>  Implementations </h2><br>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/posthuman/" class="user_link">posthuman</a> reports the existence of such services in Israel ( <a href="http://cibus.co.il/">Cibus</a> , <a href="http://10bis.co.il/">10Bis</a> , <a href="http://couponphone.co.il/">Couponphone</a> ) <br>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/suglosta/" class="user_link">suglosta</a> provides a link to <a href="http://www.sodexo.com/">Sodexo</a> , a company that provides services in Austria. <br>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/pablo/" class="user_link">pablo</a> reports the existence of a meal voucher or meal ticket.  A bit of <a href="http://www.luncheonvouchers.co.uk/aboutus/history/history.asp">history</a> . <br><br><h2>  To be continued </h2><br>  I look forward to information about the existence of such a service or about anyone's intention to do something similar.  And in a week I will tell you about the reincarnation of video rental points. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/27818/">https://habr.com/ru/post/27818/</a></p>
