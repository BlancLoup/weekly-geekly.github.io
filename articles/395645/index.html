A startup, I do not know how anyone, but for me it sounds like a <b>curse</b> .  Or abuse of the good old inventors. <br><br>  After all, how was it before? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It is clear that before and the trees were taller and the grass is greener.  But the production process in most cases looked like this.

      There is some kind of problem that zadolbala you, you solved it.  The neighbor saw and wanted to use your solution.  And his neighbors liked it too. <br><br>  Today the picture is completely different.  Herds of youth with burning eyes.  The truth is that they look like good old pirates. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/78b/957/f82/78b957f824cc3c3fa784fec50e969c99.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A group of such young men will gather and let's painfully invent what they have to do to make it look like it‚Äôs cool and still have the money to get the sucker from the investor.  And most importantly, what kind of direct IT is and as if at the height of technology.  And the fact that it is not necessary for anyone, so there is marketing, if not sold means marketing is pumped up. <br><br>  There are truth and otvylennye single, well, for example, still heard about Tesla.  Let's dig a little deeper.  That is, the boys took away from him some old man his four-seater scooter, added sparkles and glamor, and then many more sparkles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2bb/ec4/917/2bbec4917ef247e08cecbd55c20defd1.jpg"><br><br>  I would understand if guys would develop a new type of batteries or some kind of compact reactor on garbage. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/eca/8e6/bf2/eca8e6bf2d837042289b56b856544a8f.png" alt="image"><br><br>  No, it's all very difficult and you need to think.  It is much easier to take old technologies, wash them, clean and fix them with a file, get some dubious patents.  And start to treat all about green technology.  That is really really green?  Nobody wants to tell about the production and disposal of the batteries used in Tesla?  It seems to be able to withstand 600 charge cycles to reduce the level to 80%.  Ie if on average we take at least 300 km of run on a full charge, we get 180,000 km ... is it a lot or a little?  If you drive only to and from work, it should be long enough.  But again, carefully collected statistics say that on average about 140 km travels per day.  Ie 4 years roughly.  Then the batteries to the dump and buy new ones.  Hmm, what am I doing?  It seems to me that if someone out there is foaming at the mouth for the greenness of our planet, he should consider options for using public transport to get to and from work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/808/baa/2b6/808baa2b6041412291535cd59cf67711.jpg"><br><br>  This week was in the same lab on the Pacific coast.  I managed to talk a bit with the people who work there.  One group is working to improve hydrogen storage.  I looked at the new gas station. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b00/b81/f9b/b00b81f9b5644d9ab2bca62cf4c037ec.jpg"><br><br>  According to them, the only unresolved problem with cars on hydrogen is to pump a sufficient amount of hydrogen into the tanks.  And if someone starts telling that hydrogen is exploding, I advise him to check the level of gasoline in the gas tank, highlighting his lighter.  Well, as an option, you can hit the Tesla batteries with something.  And the problem with the amount of hydrogen in the tank - for today one refueling is enough for 400 km of run.  Moreover, refueling is free. <br><br>  Cars, by the way, are already on sale.  For example, <a href="https://www.hyundaiusa.com/tucsonfuelcell/index.aspx">Hyundai Tuscon</a> .  Free refueling, free maintenance.  But who cares, because there is Tesla.  The main thing is not technology, the main thing is to shout loudly that you are the most. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2d5/8d9/558/2d58d9558aacacbe8e93e1e68f088df1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But let's move on.  What we have now in the trend.  Self-managed cars.  It is stylish, fashionable and generally convenient to talk about and discuss.  I like the arguments of the autopilot amateurs in the car about the first autopilot victim.  <b>So people with drivers, people die even a little more often.</b>  I do not argue.  But then the question first arises, if there is no difference, then why pay more? <br><br>  I understand that all these companies have monsters who have suddenly rushed to develop self-managed carts, money does not bite the hens.  The crisis of ideas, it is not clear what else to develop this, so that it could at least somehow sell.  Someone even got the idea that self-driving trucks are generally terribly cool and will save something due to the fact that we‚Äôll remove the driver.  And then how this thought was carried around the globe.  Shibko she liked every startups.  Fashionable, and the dough on the sly can be mastered.  Moreover, one solution more fun than another.  And talking about optimization, I saw here the result of one optimization. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/19f/516/d78/19f516d78aa542c6874e28910b5a91e3.jpg"><br><br>  Then they need to build special roads.  That special separate terminals adapted for autonomous trucks.  But no one even thinks that the cost of transportation in the final cost of a product takes 5% in the smartest case, and that is if the product is very cumbersome and cheap, which rarely happens.  And the driver's salary is generally somewhere far after the comma.  But this is the little things.  Why tell investors and journalists about this? <br><br>  At the same time, I can still understand the countries where there are not enough drivers, but in most cases there are more than enough people without special education, but having a driver's license.  By the way, the same Uber is an example. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b32/91e/5ef/b3291e5efd1459376e37e9f1855a5dce.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Let's finish with the trucks.  Nikola One, wah, straight people will not rejoice far from freight.  Type what a cool thing.  And straight to the new year will show the current prototype.  In May, the rendered and not thoughtful from the technical side renders are shown, and in December the working prototype is straight.  Excellent bid to win.  Let's even assume that this will happen <b>suddenly</b> .  Estimated price of 375,000 dollars.  I have no idea who can be persuaded to replace three conventional trucks at an average price of 120,000 dollars, with an extensive network of support and repair, to buy one not understandable and it is not known by whom it is being repaired.  But every day of idle time in repair, not only costs the company money repair, but does not make a profit.  And no matter how super funny, economical and powerful there was, Nikola, 3 tractors will take much more than one. <br><br>  The theme of ‚Äúsmart home‚Äù is also funny.  They need common protocols, standards need to be developed.  The refrigerator that goes around the house for the owner this year showed.  And in the past, promised robo hands that will prepare food.  But why these half measures?  Thirty years ago in the USSR they formulated the final result of this trend. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/753/7c2/76d/7537c276d1c545e289af63aacacf3eab.jpg"><br><br>  But to fellow start-ups, all this is all the same, they come up with an idea and rush to embody it, and delight humanity.  And on the one hand it seems to be not bad.  People try their best.  But I would like them to at least first carry out research, study more deeply the question for which they are taken. <br><br>  Traces of their activities are found on every corner.  Take any software developed not for IT.  I think that people who are not engaged in the development of software, but using different software every day, now understand what I mean. <br><br>  I once looked into the monitor of the transportation manager.  Imagine that the Database is sick of all the tables on the display, usability?  No, not heard!  Do not rush to throw everything and start developing new software for dispatchers.  You will not be able to persuade any company that uses an existing software to go to your wonderful and convenient.  And the reason will not be because they are accustomed.  But because any thought about possible problems and the need to re-fill the database causes such panic.  Holywood nervously puffs away from envy.  And any of your assurances and explanations about backups and automatic data transfer will not change anything. <br><br>  Drivers are still funnier.  Instead of seemingly logical updateable buttons on deliveries or downloads made.  Favorite ITshniki went further, why would anyone make life easier, let's macro nafigach and let the driver sit with a bambok and look for all sorts of numbers there, then sit and enter all these macros using the on-screen keyboard. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ba0/007/8dc/ba00078dc6ed45ad81a9df097c29d40f.jpg"><br><br>  He alone has nothing to do FIG. <br><br>  Summarize.  People, you want to make the world better, first immerse yourself in the topic, because on the one hand, of course, you can accidentally get to where your help will come to the place.  And you might even make money from it.  But you really will not be ashamed of how you implemented this assistance?  Although who cares, the main thing is to rub a little more. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cdf/7aa/bbb/cdf7aabbb28e4558b823215ac65288ac.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/395645/">https://habr.com/ru/post/395645/</a></p>
