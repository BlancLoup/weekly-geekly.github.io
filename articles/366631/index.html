Hundreds of companies around the world develop and produce them.  It would seem that you can think up something new here.  But, as they say, there is potential, and a vivid confirmation of this is dozens of successful, completed funding projects on Kickstarter, with the best of which we will acquaint you today. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/aersf/aer-fit-pack-the-gym-work-bag-designed-for-the-cit%3Fref%3Ddiscovery">Aer Fit Pack</a> - the best backpack for every day <br><br>  And these are not our words.  Buyers from Hypebeast are already interested in them, he is already in the tops of thematic reviews on CoolMaterial and HiConsumption.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e90/087/9e8/e900879e88c94b0593a5f0a2d5a185d1.png"><br><br>  What is the secret of the popularity of this seemingly inconspicuous backpack?  Probably in the very actual minimalist design and 100% in the optimal design.  As they say, all ingenious is simple.  But just not always convenient, practical and utilitarian.  And here, it seems, they found the golden section. <br>  Three functional compartments - for shoes, for clothes and for everything flat.  Volume 19 liters.  Sizes 46x31x18 cm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d1b/0f7/728/d1b0f7728f7a4784a598d4fb924c62a3.png"><br><br>  Plus a dense 900D polyester with a waterproof coating as the base material. <br>  You can participate in funding and get a backpack in August for exactly $ <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/aersf/aer-fit-pack-the-gym-work-bag-designed-for-the-cit%3Fref%3Ddiscovery">99</a> . <br><br>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1121692509/the-action-pack-by-mosher-originals%3Fref%3Ddiscovery">The Action Pack</a> - backpack for hiking <br><br>  We didn‚Äôt understand what the secret of this model‚Äôs success was, however, the project is still in the funding stage, and the announced collection budget has already been more than doubled. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/db9/efc/0f2/db9efc0f2dd44423840cc4e30696091c.png"><br><br>  Yes, the optimal volume is 28 liters of the main compartment and 2 liters - the upper detachable, with a waterproof compartment for documents.  Yes, thick fabric to choose from - there is an option from stiff Cordura, from waxed canvas, from oiled army duck.  Yes, a very thoughtful arrangement of compartments. <br><br>  But there are enough analogues on the market.  Maybe the fact is that this backpack was invented and created by a guy from Canada, and there they know a lot about conquering the harsh nature. <br><br>  Of course, there are some interesting pieces here - the FdLock magnetic locks, the AirKnit breathing back, the fiberglass shoulder that distributes the load, and the YKK waterproof zippers. <br><br>  But for <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1121692509/the-action-pack-by-mosher-originals%3Fref%3Ddiscovery">$ 220</a> ?  That being said, an amateur. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1233468809/solofy%3Fref%3Ddiscovery">Solofy Envy</a> - backpack with solar panels <br><br>  Imagine: you are in the Sahara.  Fought off the group.  And we should urgently call ours or go to a page on the Internet, but, as is usually the case, the batteries of both the smartphone and the laptop are dead.  Submitted?  And here, once - and you have a backpack with solar cells, which charges the Apple tablet twice as fast as the native accessory.  Cool? <br><br>  And there are a lot of such examples in the head of the guy who created the backpack.  In any case, the story about the snow desert is also in the advertising text. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/770/f90/0ad/770f900ad28245d4a02de694817cd450.png"><br><br>  Well, in fact, in addition to the solid efficiency of energy transformation, the backpack is a faceted structure, with several internal compartments and is offered in two sizes - 12 and 25 liters.  What else can be noted is their low weight - 1 and 2 kg, respectively. <br><br>  As for the solar panels themselves, it is stated that they are not afraid of anything at all, neither scratches, nor impacts, nor water.  So if you are planning a trip God knows where, do not forget to fit into the number of project backers.  You can do it, starting from <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1233468809/solofy%3Fref%3Ddiscovery">200 euros</a> . <br><br>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/134466492/rotation180-photo-backpack%3Fref%3Ddiscovery">Rotation180 ¬∞</a> - backpack for photographers and extreme lovers <br><br>  Here is a really interesting solution - a backpack with a movable lower module, the design of which allows for quick access to the things stored there - the camera, for example. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c19/173/58f/c1917358f60147e0a86cfea94986cb4d.png"><br><br>  Although this project ended on Kickstarter in 2013, it subsequently very successfully turned into an operating business - <a href="http://www.mindshiftgear.com/">Mindshift</a> .  Moreover, the model of such a backpack won the prestigious award at one of the most prestigious Red Dot Design competitions in 2014 in the Outdoor category. <br><br>  Read about all the chips and innovations on the site, there are four variants of Rotation 180 backpacks presented there, prices start at <a href="http://www.mindshiftgear.com/">$ 180</a> . <br><br>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1070115441/the-worlds-greatest-backpack-bowerbags/description">Bowerbag</a> - three-in-one backpack <br><br>  Although the creators of Kickstarter called their project very simply - ‚ÄúThe best backpack in the world‚Äù, we will focus on a more functional characteristic - a transformer. <br><br>  Yes, the main focus of the model is on versatility.  This may be a frame bag for bikers: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d32/09d/65f/d3209d65fff54e50a34c01a7c8babb76.png"><br><br>  This may be a messenger bag for daily wear: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e6a/7a4/2b0/e6a7a42b0c4e4ab780e7ef9727148c37.png"><br><br>  And a backpack for all kinds of activities: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/266/a37/ce2/266a37ce246948dbae425a10c1349e90.png"><br><br>  The project went through successful funding back in 2012 and today it has become a fully successful operating business in the same area of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating functional backpacks and utilitarian luggage.  You can find the entire range on <a href="http://www.bowerbags.com/">Bowerbags.com</a> . <br><br>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/537437576/freerider-pannier-for-urban-bike-commuting-made-in/description">Freerider</a> - backpack bag on the trunk <br><br>  Bike, California philosophy, local authenticity plus ecology and recycled materials.  If you tie these objects and concepts together and start thinking about how to implement all this in a backpack for cyclists, then you will get this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2b7/65e/1fa/2b765e1fab69401db278037de3c84b10.png"><br><br>  Almost all leading American biker publications have written about these backpacks - from Bicycle Times and Bike Hugger to Bicycle Retailer and Urban Velo.  So it is no wonder - the project completed funding at the end of last year with an excellent result. <br><br>  The result - two models made in one case from recycled nylon from a local company producing tents.  In the other - from recycled bicycle tires.  Plus an original design on the theme of the eternal symbols of California from GreenGuru.  Here, on the site <a href="http://www.greengurugear.com/">Greengurugear.com</a> , these backpacks can be purchased at prices from $ 75. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/842978788/ember-equipment-modular-urban-pack/description">Ember Equipment</a> - modular backpack <br><br>  When professionals come to work - and Ember Equipment from San Francisco is far from new to the functional design market - then this is the result.  The project raised over $ 330,000, and that's why: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f4e/560/f1c/f4e560f1c2174981bcf7dbde36b3b678.png"><br><br>  Modular backpack in the best traditions of industrial design.  Original design.  The most premium materials range from waterproof four-layer cordura and anodized aluminum for fittings to waterproof YKK rubberized zippers and genuine leather inserts.  Plus the ability to choose the necessary mounted modules for their own needs.  As a result, there are several options for the layout of backpacks.  From the most minimalist for $ 265: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d89/3b3/b23/d893b3b230634447b6bd5ee0c74b78d1.png"><br><br>  Up to a maximum Outfitter Pack for $ 370: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a72/1f1/d4b/a721f1d4b2c141c29081e794afc5d73d.png"><br><br>  In general, as you can see, backpacks are invented and created, improved and endowed with new functions.  So choose today on the market is from what. <br><br> <a href="http://litemf.com/ru/price"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/521/d7d/506/521d7d506c53477494e0b40d66252dba.png"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/366631/">https://habr.com/ru/post/366631/</a></p>
