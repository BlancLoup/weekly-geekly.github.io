Transportation rules</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img title="aeroflot" align="left" src="http://img35.imageshack.us/img35/3497/aeroflot.jpg"><br>  I want to talk about how I recently found myself in a fairly normal situation for me faced a rather unusual position on the part of the Russian airline Aeroflot. <br><br>  Having agreed on two vacation days, I received weekends from 4 to 8 November and decided to fly home to the Siberian city of Tyumen.  Having a bad experience with Sky Express, this time I decided to use the largest airline in Russia, Aeroflot, imagining it to be a solid and reliable office. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I ordered round-trip tickets to St. Petersburg-Moscow-Tyumen for a modest 8 thousand rubles.  For comparison, I can say that this is the same amount for which I could fly SkyExpress and a third cheaper than the flight airline S7. <br><br>  As always, nothing foreshadowed trouble, the check-in took place on time and I went to the gym to wait for boarding.  Twenty minutes before departure, landing did not begin.  There is no electronic display in this hall of Pulkovo airport, and the speaker announcing the beginning of the landing was treacherously silent. <br>  I have always been saddened by the warning at passengers at Russian airports about flight delays and I honestly got used to it.  As a result, the flight was delayed by 40 minutes, but then I was calm and thought that I would be in time for my transit flight to Tyumen.  I started to get excited when waiting for the ramp for 10 minutes, looked at my watch and saw precious minutes running away.  As a result, driving up to the arrival of Sheremetyevo-1, I saw people getting close to the bus and thinking that this was most likely my flight.  Running after reaching the transit stand ...

      ... Part skipped ... (summary: late for the flight. Next exactly one day. Check in to the hotel. Order another airline ticket in the morning. Move from Sheremetye to Domodedovo.) <br><br>  Being a responsible person, I decided to call Aeroflot and report that I wouldn‚Äôt fly them (which by then had to wait more than 15 hours) and I shouldn‚Äôt be looked at the hotel because I had already checked out. <br><br>  What was my surprise when a woman on the line informed me that if I did not take them by flight in 15 hours, then my return ticket would be canceled.  My surprise was impossible to put into words: the airline delayed the flight makes me wait a day, and when I am ready to incur losses and buy myself another ticket, it deprives me of the ticket back. <br>  I have repeatedly polled my own flights and transit flights through the delay of other airlines, but no one ever deprived me of a return ticket, because I did not use the ‚Äúthere‚Äù ticket. <br><br>  As a result, my additional expenses for air travel amounted to 8t.r. more, and Aeroflot returned me 2500 rubles for a canceled return ticket. <br><br>  I don't even know if the toli miser pays twice, the toli it could happen to anyone. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/75258/">https://habr.com/ru/post/75258/</a></p>
