Like the brand new VW Golf with an electric motor.  Only Tesla is out of the list, as the Model X travels 426 kilometers on one charge.

And Ippolit Romanov, the inventor of the two-seater electric car, asked the St. Petersburg Duma to allow opening ten routes for eighty omnibuses.  Such a turn of events did not suit the horse owners and izobopromyshnikov - they did everything possible to ensure that the project Romanov did not take place.  Unfortunately, Romanov lost in this fight. <br><br>  In 1914 there were 8 electric carriages in Russia: 4 trucks, 1 tricycle van and 3 private cars. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a7e/c1f/6d6/a7ec1f6d67e22eb834547be7af197b5a.png" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  The firm "Dux" tried to produce such a bus for movement on rails. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/908/fe0/c87/908fe0c879d82b8bf4633668b965f8ce.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  Since there were a lot of electric cars and steam-powered cars in the United States at the beginning of the century, charging stations were there as often as gas stations.

These electric cars were collected until 1939.  Initially, cars equipped with lead-acid batteries, but from 1911 to 1916, it was possible to choose a version with Edison's iron-nickel battery.  The maximum speed was 32 km / h, and the car could drive 130 kilometers. <br><br>  During World War I, gasoline prices were high, so in the 1910s electric cars were in special demand - the company sold up to two thousand units a year.  In the 1920s, sales declined due to lower prices for cars with an internal combustion engine. <br><br>  In this photo - Thomas Edison at the car of this brand.  The company was owned by Thomas Edison, John Rockefeller and Henry Ford's wife, Clara Ford. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/48d/26d/346/48d26d34653c856ffc53c10c917e0bb3.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  EV-Opera-Car, model 68/17 B. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/84e/f64/149/84ef641494f6372583dcd7cdd89c30b2.jpg" width="400" alt="image"><br><br>  1915 model. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1aa/8c1/5a9/1aa8c15a9ed4fe6cdaf22292b93d1480.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  Print ads for Detroit Electric cars of the 1920s. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bba/2f7/3a0/bba2f73a072daf85bfef30edfdd60d1b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Hybrid cars did not come up yesterday or the day before yesterday.  In 1916, Clinton Edgar Woods began production of the <a href="http://revsinstitute.org/news/the-henry-ford/">Woods Dual Power Model 44 Coupe</a> with an electric motor and an internal combustion engine ‚Äî two at once. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bc7/0d1/a03/bc70d1a0305125e41f1386803beee76b.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9af/891/88b/9af89188b972e3eca45b64e18ed4cf15.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  In the USSR in 1935, an electric vehicle was built on the basis of GAZ-A. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fae/176/adf/fae176adf34c295ff348bd851a8c3bfa.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  In the same year, an accumulator garbage truck was built at MEI, having converted the ZIS-5 into it.  The car was equipped with forty batteries with a total capacity of 168 ampere-hours, their weight was 1,400 kg.  Such an electric vehicle was capable of transporting garbage weighing 1800 kg at a speed of 24 km / hour for forty kilometers.  Engine power - 13 kW. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4cb/263/8ef/4cb2638efb7a05a8e3b98eee9ed0e676.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  Swedish truck with an electric motor, 1943. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/123/f85/f0e/123f85f0ecd21f7539ccd33f5808e2f5.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  Nissan TAMA since 1947 was produced in the passenger and cargo versions.

Another ten prototypes until 1958 carried the mail in Leningrad. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7a7/9cd/14b/7a79cd14bf369bddd0d7ac999b74dc51.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  The peak of the production of electric cars hit the 1910s.  From electric vehicles there was no burning and soot, women chose them, because they did not need to possess stunning physical strength to start them - unlike the internal combustion engines. <br><br>  What were the disadvantages of electric vehicles?  The roads were too good, people wanted to go far - and at the beginning of the century it was more difficult to place <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/245938/">charging stations</a> across every hundred kilometers.  Without recharging, electric cars could drive one hundred one hundred and thirty kilometers, like some cars now. <br><br>  Thanks to Henry Ford, car prices have declined, and an increase in oil production has caused a reduction in fuel costs.  The electric starter - it was developed in 1912 - made cars with an internal combustion engine more comfortable.  Since the thirties, the production of electric vehicles has ceased to be massive, despite attempts to use them for official purposes. <br><br>  In the 1960s ‚Äì 1970s, people thought about ecology and again remembered electric motors.  But that's another story‚Ä¶ <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/834/b73/5ee/834b735eea0b5ab7c8614ef40935e991.jpg" width="600" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/376941/">https://habr.com/ru/post/376941/</a></p>
