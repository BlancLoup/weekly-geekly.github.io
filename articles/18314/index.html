  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mobile 2.0 Choosing the preferred method of communication</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A telephone is such a wonderful thing that allows you to combine different means of data transmission.  Telephones are cellular, satellite, skype. <br><br>  The youngest satellite telephony system created with the money of Arab sheikhs, THURAYA, although it provides a rather weak coverage (Middle East, part of Europe, part of Africa), is good because it has lower cost of calls, compared to INMARSAT, Globalstar and IRIDIUM, and uses phones comparable in size with cellular.  But the most important feature (however, Globalstar phones also have such an opportunity) is that if such a phone finds a cellular network (gsm), then it switches to it, that is, it is registered on the network and works like a regular cellular phone when the signal of the cellular network is lost then the phone switches back to satellite mode. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  There are separate devices spype-phones that, finding wi-fi, connect to the Internet and allow you to call using VoIP (Voice over IP).  The point is that a skype client is installed on such a phone, and the skype feature is that calls between skype clients are absolutely free, only the traffic required for voice transmission is paid.  There are mobile versions of skype clients (and similar programs), that is, programs that are installed on the phone and allow voice to be transmitted using not the mobile operator‚Äôs voice service, but data transfer (for example, gprs / edge or more advanced 3g technologies).  Some, of course, predict that in the future, cellular operators will be exclusively providers, that is, they will be needed only in order to drive VoIP traffic (Internet traffic) over their networks.  However, it is more convenient for users when a phone with a skype client installed for data transmission uses free wi-fi.  However, in some cases even a paid wi-fi connection may turn out to be cheaper than having to pay the cellular operator for connection to the Internet. <br><br>  Well, finally communicate using Bluetooth.  The tempting idea is to use the phone as a Bluetooth radio, in this case, absolutely no one needs to pay for traffic or voice connection.  The only range is not so great.  By the way, one friend told me that he and his wife were chatting at home via Bluetooth chat.  That is, when his wife is sitting in a room with her daughter who is sleeping, and he works in another one, so as not to make noise, they exchange messages via Bluetooth (naturally with the help of a special program) absolutely free of charge (by the way, you can remember there was such an advertisement that the husband and his wife were sitting on the couch at the TV they exchange sms with the general meaning of which ‚Äúbut don‚Äôt we go to the bedroom and do not fulfill the marital duty‚Äù while their child sits between them and enthusiastically watches TV).

      Well, if you combine all the above functionality in one device, you will be able to talk on the phone at any place where satellite telephony draws, when a cellular network appears, call using it (it will be cheaper than satellite calls), then when wi-fi is detected, the conversation will be transmitted via VoIP, well, if a person is quite close but for some reason, direct conversation is not possible, then you can talk via Bluetooth. <br><br>  Following this concept, a person can always get through.  It will be a bit more difficult to get through to him himself, since it is not clear which network he is currently located at, but if you use the ideas from the ‚Äú <a href="http://lvea.habrahabr.ru/blog/33321.html">person-number</a> ‚Äù note, then this issue is easily resolved. <br><br>  Original article written by me <a href="http://mobilemandarin.com/2007/06/15/mobile-20-vyibor-predpochtitelnogo-sposoba-svyazi/">here.</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/18314/">https://habr.com/ru/post/18314/</a></p>
