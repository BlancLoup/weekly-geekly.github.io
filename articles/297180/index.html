However, there is little control over the employees; information about the results of their work must be somehow preserved in order to see the change in key indicators over time.

    <h4>  What is field management </h4><br>  Often, such staff engaged in the execution of orders on the road, work suboptimally.  The employer is difficult to track the quality of services provided.  In addition, in some areas, employees can directly negotiate with clients and work for themselves using company materials and tools (a classic example is the use of official cars for personal purposes). <br><br>  Significantly increase the efficiency of mobile employees allows the use of special tools - in the West, they are called field management software.  Such services allow you to set uniform standards for the quality of work - for example, through the introduction of checklists (checklists) of items that must be performed to solve a problem.  According to this scheme, our Planado service works. <br><br>  Upon completion of work using the application, the employee must send a photo report to the office.  In addition, workers' movements are displayed on Yandex.Maps, which allows managers in the office to optimize routes based on traffic jams ‚Äî this optimization allows you to carry out more orders a day. <br><br>  Field management tools significantly increase the efficiency of mobile workers, but they are not always easy to integrate into the company's existing infrastructure. <br><br><h4>  Accounting issue </h4><br>  There are a large number of personnel control tools (we published a selection of various services <a href="http://www.gd.ru/articles/8203-instrumenty-kontrolya-personala">here</a> and <a href="https://vc.ru/p/employees-productivity">here</a> ), but not all of them allow integration with other information accounting and analysis systems used by companies. <br><br>  All of this can create inconvenience for managers - getting information about how a particular employee works today is of course useful, but it is much more important to be able to quickly save this data so that it is easy to analyze the quality of work during a certain time.  Similarly, it is much more convenient when creating an outfit in such a system to automatically insert client information from CRM into it. <br><br>  If, on the other hand, the integration capabilities do not provide a tool for increasing work efficiency, the manager is forced to transfer the necessary information to and from the field management system manually. <br><br>  It is time consuming and just uncomfortable, so we decided to correct the situation. <br><br><h4>  Integration Planado and Bitrix 24 </h4><br>  To increase the efficiency of working with Planado, we integrated it with the popular CRM-system Bitrix 24. Now the process of creating an outfit for field work has become much easier.  With the integrated integration, Planado can create a job for work when a transaction goes to a certain stage - this will use customer information from CRM. <br><br>  For example, you can easily transfer a transaction from the ‚ÄúNegotiations‚Äù stage to the ‚ÄúSubmitted to Planado‚Äù: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9fd/d07/110/9fdd07110c7c4f499fb5e80a4c90bc94.png"><br><br>  The link to the deal in Bitrix 24 will be saved in the outfit - you can easily transfer from Planado to the CRM system.  In Planado itself, the stage of the transaction is configured, during the transition to which an outfit is created, as well as a template that is used to create an outfit depending on the type of transaction. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d2c/9b3/e4c/d2c9b3e4ce3d4a32862bb790f1b5e42e.png"><br><br>  Integration with CRM Bitrix 24 in Planado is activated in the Settings -&gt; Integration -&gt; CRM (available for Pro fare) section.  In the CRM system, you can add integration by installing the Planado application from the Bitrix store - this requires administrative rights to the Bitrix. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/da5/2ed/f40/da52edf40f2d402c97762779ea261747.png"><br><br>  In the course of execution, along with Planado adds the relevant comments to the transaction in Bitrix 24, which facilitates the manager to track progress in solving the problem. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f31/751/f41/f31751f4175a401eae99faa5d5330629.png"><br><br>  After completing the work, the transaction in CRM moves to a new stage - for example, ‚ÄúDone in Planado‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/529/3fd/b70/5293fdb700654e5dbe15e8988e604840.png"><br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  The introduction of systems for managing field employees can seriously increase the productivity of their work and bring additional profit to the business - we have created a <a href="http://www.planado.ru/">special calculator</a> to calculate the potential benefits of using Planado. <br><br>  You can further increase the impact of using field management tools by combining them with your existing business software infrastructure.  The integration of Planado with CRM Bitrix 24 significantly reduces the time to transfer information from one system to another, and also minimizes the likelihood of errors.  Field work outfits are created on the basis of information about the stage of the transaction in CRM, using customer data stored in the system. <br><br>  All this increases the quality of services provided and allows businesses to save time of employees, which allows to increase the overall productivity of work. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297180/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297180/</a></p>
