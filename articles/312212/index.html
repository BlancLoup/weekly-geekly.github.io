      Using the example of automating the testing of an enterprise solution, I will tell you how the approach to building a system of autotests evolved and how it developed as a result.  It all started off as KDT FW, but as the solution evolved and experience accumulated, the implementation began to shift towards BDD using the LR parser from Yandex.  We will talk about how the initial approach to AT was chosen, what metrics you looked at when it was implemented, based on what assumptions the solution evolved.  At the end of my report I will talk about the results that have now been achieved, and answer your questions.  The report is focused on testing managers, test leads, but it will be useful to other participants to expand their horizons. <br><br><hr><br>  Mikhail Sokolov.  Always ready!  How to use the Hystirx to make the application reliable. <br><br>  He has worked at Luxoft since 2010.  He has extensive experience in enterprise software development.  During his time at the company, he participated in several projects for a large American aircraft manufacturing company in various roles from developer to architect.  He is currently a Java developer and trainer at the Luxoft training center.  He is interested in technologies for creating scalable, high-performance, distributed applications, as well as functional programming languages.  He likes to share knowledge about interesting technologies and programming. <br><br>  Most of us faced problems in production: the service suddenly ‚Äúhung‚Äù, the used library is unreliable and constantly falls, dragging our application along.  How can we make our application more resilient and enduring problems and accidents? <br><br>  The report will look at various techniques that can be used to increase the reliability of the application, as well as how they are used by Hystrix.  We will look at how to isolate calls to external services and libraries with Hystrix, thereby making the application less susceptible to cascading errors. <br><br>  <b>When and where?</b>  <b>check in</b> <br><br>  <b>Registration links:</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ October 20, Kazakhstan, Karaganda, Restaurant BEAR, N.
