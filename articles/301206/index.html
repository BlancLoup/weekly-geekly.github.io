    <h3>  <b># 1 Leave your dog for a jerk</b> </h3><br>  The first question arises, where to attach a pet.  With the help of the <a href="https://dogvacay.com/">DogVacay</a> service <a href="https://dogvacay.com/">,</a> we find a person for overexposure for a holiday. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c61/5a7/b31/c615a7b31b5d40edaeb0d859b673b9df.png"><br><br><h3>  <b># 2a Going to the airport</b> </h3><br>  Then we order a car to the airport at <a href="https://www.uber.com/ru/">Uber</a> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5ea/3cf/908/5ea3cf908f4347f78f37e6b3b1e03b3b.png"><br><br><h3>  <b># 2b Finding a companion</b> </h3><br>  Or for a local trip we find a companion with the help of <a href="https://www.blablacar.ru/">Blablakar</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/65a/874/a2d/65a874a2dd0242a28d0d10efbf4f2203.png"><br><br><h3>  <b># 3 We arrive at the apartment</b> </h3><br>  We arrive at the apartment that we previously found on <a href="https://ru.airbnb.com/">Airbnb</a> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f63/c7c/40c/f63c7c40c78c400596b3d78c33879ab2.png"><br><br><h3>  <b># 4 Find a local guide</b> </h3><br>  For a good acquaintance with the city, we find a local guide on <a href="http://www.viator.com/">Viatore</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a22/b6e/d28/a22b6ed2849242698e916e95f2506e13.png"><br><br>  As a result, we have a great vacation and bring home a bunch of cool photos that will easily help to hang out around the apartment. <br><br><h3>  <b># 5 Order Wizard</b> </h3><br>  Coming home from a trip many realize that the first thing to do is clean up.  This problem can be solved by ordering specialists from <a href="http://kiev.kabanchik.ua/">Kabanchik.ua</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c23/82d/cd5/c2382dcd55964789b9b794aafe072c77.png"><br><br><h3>  <b># 6 Parking Lot Delivery</b> </h3><br>  And we earned money for this trip due to the fact that for several months we rented an unnecessary parking space in our yard with the help of <a href="https://www.yourparkingspace.co.uk/">Yourparkingspace</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6a8/d97/5e3/6a8d975e31b549a2b37e31ddde40bd02.png"><br><br>  The essence of the idea is clear!  Sharing economy now allows you to organize any process convenient and much cheaper.  Allows you to properly redistribute resources in the world.  People began to realize that owning something was not necessary.  The main thing to know where you can quickly get the right thing in the shortest possible time. <br><br><h2>  <b>Predict future behaviors</b> </h2><br>  The most noticeable change in behavior among young people.  They especially like the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãfreedom from property.  They can often relocate, their lifestyle is relatively flexible.  This applies not only real estate, but also cars. <br><br>  ‚ÄúChildren of the millennium‚Äù are culturally programmed to take and rent and use things together.  They have no admonition that after studying you need to work 15 years and save up for the purchase of your own apartment.  They don‚Äôt buy newspapers, but pick up and spread news via Facebook and Twitter.  They do not buy DVD players, but exchange TV shows and shows in torrents.  They don't buy CDs, but subscribe to music on services like Spotify or AppleMusic. <br><br>  Would you like to predict user behaviors in a few years?  - Look at how young people are now behaving and scale it to the whole world. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f33/ea4/8f7/f33ea48f70cc46f889bd37a089f4a797.png"><br><br><h2>  <b>Separation of personal and business needs</b> </h2><br>  Also, there is an ever deeper diving sharing of business saving needs. <br>  Last year, UBER and AIRBNB launched separate applications that are designed for business and will allow you to share personal expenses with corporate ones. <br><br>  There are no corporate rates or discounts in these offers.  Applications are more convenient for employees, as you can order a car or book accommodation directly from a corporate account and not provide then a report on the funds spent. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2fe/eb0/e9a/2feeb0e9ac304ba6ade7b37b8f3273ab.png"><br><br>  Over the coming years, Airbnb corporate customers are expected to catch up with private customers. <br><br><h2>  <b>Sharing economy as a marketing tool</b> </h2><br>  Also, many companies are beginning to use sharing economy technology as marketing.  Home Depot retail chain in almost half of its stores (there are about 2000 in the US) has created a department in which you can rent goods from carts to saws and drills.  Michael Jones, director of this direction emphasizes that all items are in excellent condition and this is a competitive advantage over rental offers from private individuals. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6c6/231/2df/6c62312dfe594057a7b485de90c8a47a.png"><br><br>  General Motors has invested $ 3 million in car rental services from private RelayRides.  This is marketing.  The company expects that the person who took the Chevrolet for rent will love this brand so much that it will buy it later.  To stimulate demand for its cars, GM went to the fact that it reads the cost of rent in the fee for a new car. <br><br>  In the future, this approach can be successfully used even in a telecom: I took a smartphone for rent for several days, and then I bought it, because I don‚Äôt want to give back my favorite smart. <br><br><h2>  <b>Ecological bonus</b> </h2><br>  An additional plus of the development of a shared consumption economy is the preservation of the environment (car-sharing can reduce CO2 emissions into the atmosphere by up to 27%). <br><br>  In Europe, services that earn on renting two-wheeled friends for rent are flourishing both in the private business segment and under the protectorate of administrative authorities. <br><br>  The leaders are Paris, London, Amsterdam. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/62a/e08/f8c/62ae08f8c389451f9cbd2fc42e478f20.png"><br><br><h2>  <b>Impact of sharing economy on the market</b> </h2><br>  Economists have not yet decided how to evaluate sharing economy.  They are faced with the question of whether a new value is created as a result, or simply new services are replacing an existing business. <br><br>  Probably fit both answers.  A short-term negative effect on the economy is always possible, because as a result a person does not buy a new car.  But in the long run, the economy wins, and that‚Äôs good for everyone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ce6/078/4a5/ce60784a5aa44bb6a52c5e247ff520b3.png"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/301206/">https://habr.com/ru/post/301206/</a></p>
