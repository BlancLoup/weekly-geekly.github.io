Our interest was slightly supported by minor updates - the ‚Äústyling‚Äù of the good old Mavic ‚Äî the white version, Platinum, which in essence was nothing more than a variation on the subject, without any major improvements in flight functions or shooting. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rs/rc/v5/rsrcv5tbiedbyawbjk_q5_iydy8.jpeg">

      There were a lot of rumors about the release of Mavic 2, but still no specific data was available.  DJI has secrecy in order, and some of the photos that have appeared do not give a complete picture.  Let's be honest - the first Mavic was good.  Really good.  Compact, mobile, long and sufficiently far flying and shooting well.  But it was ‚Äúnot bad‚Äù and it was the very (although not very big) fly in the ointment.  Always accompanied by some kind of dilemma - the mobility of Mavic or the quality of the shooting Phantom 4 PRO.  The first one makes it possible to travel light, and most importantly - often, why bother, to fly where it is not desirable to attract the attention of passers-by, security, police, and so on, and the second - the quality of photos and videos approaching the SLR cameras.  The new Mavic 2 has become the quietest of the entire series thanks to the new propellers, engines and new speed controllers. <br><br>  But the main thing - the <a href="https://coptertime.ru/catalog/dji-mavic-2/dji-mavic-2-pro/%3Froistat%3Dhabr_mavic2anno">new DJI Mavic 2 Pro</a> took a serious step forward - it was possible to fit a rather large 1 ‚Äùmatrix into a compact form factor - like the one installed in Phantom 4 PRO.  We will not get ahead of ourselves until we have had a test sample, but ‚Äútabular‚Äù values, and the main reputation of HASSELBLAD is the right to believe that the quality of shooting should rise to a new level. <br><br>  The new Mavic 2 Pro camera now also has a diaphragm aperture, which is convenient for obtaining the required shutter speed under various lighting conditions and allows you to receive 10-bit video, and also supports HDR video (HLG 10-bit) and the H.265 codec.  The maximum resolution of photos is 5472 √ó 3648 pixels, of course, with the support of DNG / Raw. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0e/kv/rl/0ekvrlmnx4fjblksiaeenxnuy1u.jpeg"><br><br>  What does it mean?  The end of the line "Phantom"?  Who knows, there may be a move to another ‚Äúleague‚Äù.  The undoubted advantage of the Phantom 4 Pro are, of course, the flight characteristics - high power, with a good margin, thanks to which - good wind resistance often exceeds the estimated 10m / s, and still (although we and the manufacturer categorically do not recommend) water resistance and tolerance by our winter, making it relatively inexpensive (in comparison with the Inspire 2) tool for the most extreme and dangerous shootings, giving excellent image quality.  But it's not about the Phantom - the new Mavic 2 Pro promises to be no less a hit than the first version, due to the sum of factors - compactness, long flight time - up to 31 minutes and the quality of shooting.  ‚ÄúNo‚Äù to compromise.  DJI has done the truly impossible by combining all the best from Mavic Pro and Phantom 4 Pro in such a small package without sacrificing anything, but on the contrary going to a new level.  The maximum flight speed can reach 72km / h, which will allow you to rent cars, boats and more, which would require Inspire earlier.  Also, the ActiveTrack system has been reworked, allowing to monitor objects.  In the new version, all 3 front cameras take part in tracking the object, creating a three-dimensional model of the surrounding space for more accurate tracking, while not forgetting to fly around obstacles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/c8/l4/nu/c8l4nunpx2b0n04_fuoawolcuvk.jpeg"><br><br>  The second novelty was a slightly more budget option - <a href="https://coptertime.ru/catalog/dji-mavic-2/dji-mavic-2-zoom/%3Froistat%3Dhabr_mavic2anno">Mavic 2 ZOOM</a> .  The ‚ÄúMavic 2 carcass‚Äù carries a camera with a 1 / 2.3 matrix. In essence, this is a camera similar to the first Mavic, but now it has a 2x optical zoom (and we get an increase of 4 times in total with 2x digital zoom shooting in 1080p. It's not a secret that these copters are used not only for creativity, but also hunters and security organizations and search engines. Such an option can be quite useful in various fields of application. Also a great advantage is the possibility of obtaining a ‚Äúcinema‚Äù picture with blurred background bl  Godard relatively long focus not previously available compact copter. Not less interesting feature that allows you to create images and very high resolution (up to 48mpiks) in automatic mode. <br><br>  It is reported that through a dealer it will be possible to change one camera to another, which this will be in practice, time will tell.  Write in the comments who would like both cameras and are interested in the possibility of rearranging the Hasselblad gimbal on the Zoom. <br><br>  Both copters also have an advanced collision avoidance system - now 10 sensors (including new side sensors and a camera at the back) ensure safety of flights and dynamic overflight of obstacles thanks to the APAS system.  The lower cameras are supplemented with a diode backlight to ensure a safe and accurate fit at any time of the day. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wr/ud/cj/wrudcjyurjbe8xx0xw8xqe8gaby.jpeg"><br><br>  All this would not be so good without the updated video transmission system - now the new OcuSync 2.0 allows you to fly a distance of up to 8 km and transmit video in real time with a resolution of up to 1080p with minimal delay. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fr/bd/8s/frbd8s05gt4v-w46hzwmfupqx0c.jpeg"><br><br>  In addition to the standard kit, a Fly More Combo kit is offered, including all the necessary accessories in one box.  Fly More is sold separately. <br><br>  Video announcement Mavik 2 <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7SembcsxrQw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Where can one buy: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://coptertime.ru/catalog/dji-mavic-2/dji-mavic-2-pro/%3Froistat%3Dhabr_mavic2anno">DJI Mavic 2 Pro</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://coptertime.ru/catalog/dji-mavic-2/dji-mavic-2-zoom/%3Froistat%3Dhabr_mavic2anno">DJI Mavic 2 Zoom</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://coptertime.ru/catalog/dji-mavic-2-acc/dji-mavic-2-fly-more-kit/%3Froistat%3Dhabr_mavic2anno">Fly More Kit</a> </li></ul><br>  We recommend that you pre-order to book a new product and get it first. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/421113/">https://habr.com/ru/post/421113/</a></p>
