Many IT people often fly on business trips and on vacation, accumulating airline miles.  Let's see what programs are profitable, how miles are credited, but first things first. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e7e/a8a/a01/e7ea8aa01c16445c6ad2556c53c97fb1.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Many banks have become popular card issued with a special offer - the accumulation of bonus miles.  In the future, these miles can be compensated for the purchase of air tickets.  The essence of loyalty programs in all banks is the same - to attract new customers and give them the opportunity, with active use, to fly about 1 time a year on a plane absolutely free of charge.  Below we tell how the bank actually earns miles, how to spend them correctly and what difficulties and illusions are found in these bonuses. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/54b/98f/58c/54b98f58c72d82b3cc3462d7891b8d86.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Banks and cards with such offers are a very large number. <br>  For the example, the cards were selected - <a href="https://www.tcsbank.ru/credit/cards/allairlines/">All Airlines</a> from Tinkoff Bank Platinum Credit Systems (hereinafter AA), <a href="http://alfacards.ru/catalog/aeroflot/mc_aeroflot_mass/">Aeroflot MasterCard Gold</a> from Alfa Bank and <a href="http://www.raiffeisen.ru/retail/cards/card_page/%3Fid28%3D6160">Gold Travel VISA</a> from Raiffeisen Bank. <br><br>  These banks were not chosen by chance: they are very popular with IT audiences. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/44c/ea2/211/44cea2211b3bf1cfdae80cfced21fcef.png" alt="image">  <b>How much is the loyalty program</b> <br><br>  As such, the loyalty program is not paid for separately by the client and, according to the Bank, it is free.  In fact, most cards with a loyalty program imply a high, and sometimes even a premium status of a card, which may indicate a relatively high cost of service.  Thus, switching to a loyalty program with airline miles, the client begins to overpay for annual service 3-4 times more. <br><br>  We chose maps of approximately the same status and logic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c40/667/095/c40667095507c8be231de563128c36d3.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>annual card service fee</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/44c/ea2/211/44cea2211b3bf1cfdae80cfced21fcef.png" alt="image">  <b>How do I earn miles</b> <br><br>  Each bank has its own rules for calculating bonuses.  As a rule, for some purchases, a percentage of the purchase price is charged on a ‚Äúmile‚Äù account.  Everywhere he is different and may even differ from the category of purchase.  An example of this is AllAirlines.  <b>2% of the cost of all purchases</b> on the card, <b>1% for transactions</b> made via the Internet Bank or Mobile Application, <b>3% for purchases of air tickets</b> and increased rates for special offers up to 30% of the purchase price. <br><br>  At Alfa Bank and Raiffeisen, everything is much simpler.  In the first, <b>for every 30 rubles</b> that you spend, <b>1.25 miles</b> will ‚Äúfall‚Äù into the account <b>.</b> <br>  Well, Raiffeisen earns <b>1 mile for every 40 rubles</b> spent from the card.  There is also an additional partner <a href="http://www.iglobe.ru/">iGlobe.ru</a> , where for every 48 rubles you can get up to 15 miles when booking services on your card.  This amount immediately makes you think that for forty-eight rubles? .. After reading the small print, we learn that this charge will occur for every euro spent on the site (Miles are calculated based on the order value in euros. The number of miles may vary depending on the ruble to the euro.) <br><br>  The last two cards immediately raised a question.  Not all numbers are divided by 30 or 40 without a residue.  After reading more details with these loyalty programs, we can single out a similar principle for earning miles.  The purchase amount is divided by 30 or 40, the result is multiplied by the coefficient of accrual miles. <br><br>  There is a separate "but" - rounding the value of miles to a whole.  This always happens according to the rules of the bank.  A good example is the purchase on the Alfa-Bank card in the amount of 187.20 rubles.  Mathematically, the sum of miles for an accrual of 7.8, but after rounding, only 7 miles will be credited. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2ef/749/614/2ef7496144850fc490b7bb5a4cb760ce.png" alt="image">  Waiting for settlement <br>  187.20 / 30 = 6.24;  6.24 * 1.25 = 7.8 <br>  Real action <br><ol><li>  187.20 / 30 = 6.24 </li><li>  6.24 * 1.25 = 7.8 </li><li>  7.8 = 7 </li><li>  Accrued 7 miles. </li></ol><br><br>  At first glance, the order of crediting miles on the Tinkoff Credit Systems is significantly different.  But this decision was wrong.  The <a href="https://static.tcsbank.ru/documents/credit_cards/AAloyaltyprogram.pdf">detailed terms of the action</a> describe the process of ‚Äúreal counting‚Äù. <br><br>  If we translate into the ‚Äúlanguage‚Äù of other examples, then for every 100 rubles a client will receive the corresponding coefficient of miles.  A distinctive feature is the rounding process.  When buying in a store for 299 rubles, I should get 5 miles (by analogy with other examples), but in fact only 4 miles will be credited to the account. <br>  The sum is divided by one hundred, rounded down to a whole number, and only then multiplied by a factor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2ef/749/614/2ef7496144850fc490b7bb5a4cb760ce.png" alt="image">  Peculiarity of rounding in TCS Bank: <br><ol><li>  299/100 = 2.99 </li><li>  2.99 = 2 </li><li>  2 * 2 = 4 </li><li>  4 miles earned </li></ol><br>  This is the kind of mathematics that banks use. <br><br><table><tbody><tr><th></th><th>  Alfa Bank </th><th>  Raffaisen Bank </th><th>  TCS Bank </th></tr><tr><td>  1 mile </td><td>  30 rubles </td><td>  40 rubles </td><td>  ~ 50 rubles </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  Another important role is played by the category of goods, which is bought on the map.  From this category may depend on the coefficient of accrual of miles, which can help save them much faster. <br><br><table><tbody><tr><th></th><th>  Alfa Bank </th><th>  Raffaisen Bank </th><th>  TCS Bank </th></tr><tr><th>  Products </th><td>  1.25 </td><td>  one </td><td>  2 </td></tr><tr><th>  mobile connection </th><td>  1.25 </td><td>  one </td><td>  1 (when using the Internet Bank) </td></tr><tr><th>  Hotel Reservations </th><td>  1.25 </td><td>  up to 15 when using iGlobe.ru </td><td>  10 when using travel.tcsbank.ru </td></tr><tr><th>  Flights </th><td>  1.25 </td><td>  up to 15 when using partners </td><td>  3 or 5 when using partners </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/44c/ea2/211/44cea2211b3bf1cfdae80cfced21fcef.png" alt="image">  <b>We start to collect miles</b> <br><br>  So how many miles can I save and where can I fly for them?  We make a comparison of the effectiveness of these cards.  We define the criteria for accrual.  Let each card spend 25,000 rubles each month.  We include in the amount of expenses the usual purchases that are not included in the categories of ‚Äúair tickets‚Äù, ‚Äúhotels‚Äù, and not belonging to the categories of higher charges.  Let it be the usual purchases of products, clothing, audio, video equipment. <br><br><table><tbody><tr><th></th><th>  Alfa Bank </th><th>  Raffaisen Bank </th><th>  TCS Bank </th></tr><tr><th>  Per month </th><td>  ~ 1040 </td><td>  ~ 625 </td><td>  ~ 500 </td></tr><tr><th>  Per year </th><td>  ~ 12500 </td><td>  ~ 7500 </td><td>  ~ 6000 </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/44c/ea2/211/44cea2211b3bf1cfdae80cfced21fcef.png" alt="image">  <b>How to spend miles</b> <br><br>  From these data, it is clearly visible that much more aviation miles can be accumulated on the Alfa-Bank card.  But this does not mean that this card is the most profitable.  More miles in the account does not guarantee in this case the possibility of compensating for a more expensive ticket. <br><br>  For example, take the ticket Moscow - St. Petersburg. <br><br><table><tbody><tr><th></th><th>  Alfa Bank </th><th>  Raffaisen Bank </th><th>  TCS Bank </th></tr><tr><th>  Miles required </th><td>  ~ 20,000 </td><td>  ~ 5600 </td><td>  6000 </td></tr><tr><th>  Accumulated </th><td>  12500 </td><td>  7500 </td><td>  6000 </td></tr><tr><th>  Total </th><td>  Do not fly away </td><td>  Fly away, if only the ticket is on the partner site </td><td>  Fly away anyway </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  The table and calculations serve as an excellent illustrative example of the fact that the number of accumulated miles is not always the main indicator of a convenient and profitable card. <br>  In addition to comparing loyalty programs, you can also compare ticket reimbursement options at a particular airline. <br><br><table><tbody><tr><th></th><th>  Alfa Bank </th><th>  Raffaisen Bank </th><th>  TCS Bank </th></tr><tr><th>  Where to spend </th><td>  Aeroflot, Delta, AlItalia, KLM, AeroMexico and other SkyTeam companies </td><td>  Companies represented on the website iGlobe.ru </td><td>  Any airline, not only Russian </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  A number of these examples speak only about one thing: loyalty programs are a very complex product of a bank that aims to lure a new potential customer.  Each air product from the bank is in its own way niche and special.  The logic of the cards is very different and, often, not very clear. <br><br>  At first glance, the profitability of the card can be formed by some ‚Äúbig‚Äù bonuses and a beautiful label, but after spending literally an hour of time, doing a simple calculation and reading 7-8 pages of bonus program conditions, you can see all the ‚Äútricks‚Äù of the banks in which you do not need to fall, or be prepared for a number of situations. <br><br>  Each bank introduces its own "but", which is presented in different ways. <br>  Use loyalty programs wisely! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/226047/">https://habr.com/ru/post/226047/</a></p>
