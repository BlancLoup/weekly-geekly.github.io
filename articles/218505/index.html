  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Who should I work then, what to do?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The world is changing at an incredible speed, people are already going to fly to Mars, the technologies of "smart" environments are developing, the ecological awareness of people is growing.  All this makes the demand for new specialists and requires re-qualification of existing ones.  Who will need in these areas in 5-10 years? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/580/657/665/5806576651c055e302c13e52ad221d0b.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Today I take another block of the Atlas of new professions, released this year (the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/214101/">first part</a> , the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/215347/">second part</a> , the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/216567/">third part</a> ).  In this post I will look at the space industry, new materials and technologies, as well as ecology. <br>  After the first publications, Pavel Luksha, the lead developer of the Atlas, contacted me and suggested collecting meaningful comments on the professions in order to supplement the Atlas with them when his version 2.0 is being prepared - it‚Äôs already obvious that there are both overlooked professions and unnecessary ones.  So if there is something to improve - let's try to improve.  Another important note from the authors of the Atlas regarding what these ‚Äúprofessions‚Äù are proposed in the Atlas: ‚ÄúWe understand by the new profession the‚Äú bundle ‚Äùof new competencies that are needed to solve the emerging new work tasks.  New work tasks are connected with the fact that technologies, work rules in the industry, etc. are changing. ‚Äù <br><br><h5>  Space </h5><br>  In the past few years, the space industry has seen a turnaround related to the first successes of private astronautics: private rocket launches have already been made cheaper than traditional launch vehicles, and serious discussions have begun on the prospects for the colonization of Mars. <br>  In addition, the commercialization of space is increasing, and this will open up broad opportunities for the creation of a private business - for example, in the service sector of satellite launches and probes.  In principle, space in the future may help the earth‚Äôs industry, for example, in the question of the disposal of toxic waste, the production of crystals in conditions of weightlessness.  Opportunities for space exploration will dramatically expand if it is possible to create cheap technologies for delivering goods and people into orbit ‚Äî for example, to build a ‚Äúspace elevator‚Äù from the Earth‚Äôs surface. <br>  However, all the professions mentioned in the Atlas are professions that may appear after 2020.  In the near future, nothing new is predicted yet.

      <i>Professions that will appear after 2020</i> <br>  <b>The architect of the life cycle of space structures.</b>  Specialist in the design of structures in open space (near-earth stations and stations on the Moon and asteroids). <br>  The most important key skill for this profession (as well as for any other profession of Atalas, where there is the word ‚Äúarchitect‚Äù) is the ability for a systemic vision of the process, retaining the framework of the life cycle of the designed object. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/46d/98b/d3f/46d98bd3f261f702710f00f873e90327.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Manager of cosmotourism.</b>  Specialist who develops programs to visit the near-cosmic space, and later - orbital complexes and other space structures (including lunar bases). <br>  According to forecasts, over the next 20 years, cosmotourism can become one of the most promising areas for the development of the space industry - here it is both popularization of direction and money.  Today, the only object used for space tourism is the ISS, it has already been visited by 7 people (one of them twice).  On the one hand, the demand for the service is constantly growing, on the other - there is a trend to reduce the price (which today is prohibitive for most 20-40 million dollars), so there is hope for the best. <br><br>  <b>Space Engineer.</b>  Specialist serving the near-Earth transport network and responsible for developing transport corridors (both flights to orbit and transcontinental flights along ballistic trajectories) and synchronization of launches / launches on Earth (with an increase in the number of launches, taking into account the multiple increase in the number of objects in orbit ). <br>  So far, such specialists are not needed, since over the past 10 years the total number of space launches has consistently kept at 75-85 per year.  However, interest in space from private companies (such as SpaceX, Virgin Galactic, Golden Spike) is growing.  And in December 2013, SpaceX managed <a href="http://goo.gl/ATxhvF">to launch a</a> heavy satellite into orbit cheaper than the Russian Proton (about $ 60 million against $ 80 million). After this launch, SpaceX announced that it already has 50 launch orders, so there is every chance The situation with the number of launches will change dramatically in the next 10 years.  So, you need specialists who will be engaged in servicing this network. <br><br>  <b>Cosmobiologist.</b>  Specialist investigating the behavior of different biological systems (from viruses to animals and humans) in space (in buildings, aircraft, at planetary stations), studying the physiology and gene changes of organisms, developing sustainable space ecosystems for orbital stations, lunar bases and long flights . <br>  At the words of a cosmobiologist, I immediately see Professor Seleznev, Alice‚Äôs father.  However, Atlas is not talking about the study of alien fauna, which has not yet been discovered, but about how and what happens in space with living biological systems.  It is necessary in order to plan long-term flights, orbital stations and so on.  Already today, similar research is being conducted in some quantity - let's say, in February of this year, a <a href="http://www.rg.ru/2014/01/26/kosmos-site.html">container with goldfish, mosquito larvae and worms</a> was <a href="http://www.rg.ru/2014/01/26/kosmos-site.html">sent</a> to the ISS to study the embryonic development of organisms.  NASA is also engaged in similar experiments: an experiment has been announced to <a href="http://www.remedium.ru/news/detail.php%3FID%3D61104">study the effects on irradiation of fibroblasts under weightless conditions</a> . <br><br>  <b>Cosmogeologist</b>  Specialist engaged in exploration and mining of minerals on the Moon and asteroids. <br>  At least two companies have already declared their goal of industrial development of asteroids - this is <a href="http://goo.gl/hQcYqm">Deep Space Industries</a> and <a href="http://goo.gl/MLgCWA">Planetary Resources</a> .  Of course, for the time being, the talk is that industrial development will not start tomorrow, but companies are working on it.  So, Deep Space Industries is raising money for the construction of the small space telescope ARKYD, with the help of which asteroids close to Earth will be studied. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7c8/17c/1d4/7c817c1d40c692ec65dc5eae76dca92d.jpg"><br><br><h5>  New materials and nanotechnology </h5><br>  <i>Professions that will appear until 2020</i> <br>  <b>Glazir.</b>  Specialist in the development and production of glass products based on glass-composite functional materials. <br>  My word "glazir" is inexorably associated either with a glazed curd or with glaze, but Atlas offers a new meaning - a technologist who is engaged in the introduction of glass composite materials.  Fiberglass, apparently, was invented in the middle of the 20th century, so the story is not new.  Nevertheless, the active growth of the use of this material in the production of various objects means that the number of such specialists will grow. <br><br>  <b>System engineer of composite materials.</b>  Specialist in replacing traditional solutions when choosing materials for composite materials in construction, engineering and robotics, medicine, etc. <br>  New composite materials and nanotechnological solutions set completely different standards for the quality characteristics of raw materials and structures and components.  The key advantages of composite materials over the old raw material base are: <br>  - high strength of structures and elements while reducing weight <br>  - polymorphism and adaptability of raw materials <br>  - resistance to critical conditions <br>  The old resource base is inferior in all qualitative and quantitative indicators, but there is the difficulty of re-equipping all industries for new materials and designs from new materials.  Thus, there is a need for specialists who will be engaged in replacing the technologies used with new ones. <br><br>  <b>Designer nanotech materials.</b>  A professional engaged in modeling properties, predicting the life cycle of nanotechnological materials using digital models.  Highly professional programmer with good knowledge of nanophysics and nanochemistry <br>  It is logical that in addition to the adaptation of technology, people who will develop new materials are needed.  It is important that the Atlas emphasizes the need to predict materials throughout the entire life cycle, which implies serious modeling skills. <br><br>  <i>Professions that will appear after 2020</i> <br>  <b>Modeler "active environment /" smart environment ".</b>  He is engaged in designing software and technological solutions for ‚Äúactive environments‚Äù: the formation of specified properties, selection of a composite material, determination of environmental conditions, integration of the environment into the common space of a home / office / industrial enterprise, identification and setting of security parameters, creation of a ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù interface, and dd <br>  A smart environment needs smart composites.  The development of ‚Äúsmart‚Äù environments, such as ‚Äúsmart‚Äù transport systems, ‚Äúsmart‚Äù houses, ‚Äúsmart‚Äù production entails a growing demand for relevant materials.  In general, today such ‚Äúsmart‚Äù composites are divided into two types: <br>  - Composites with ‚Äúbuilt-in‚Äù sensors (optical, piezoelectric, acoustic), which provide monitoring of the state of the material during its production, testing and operation, - the so-called  Passive-type ‚Äúsmart‚Äù composites <br>  - composites whose structure includes elements that control the behavior of the structure; - composites of the active type.  Such composites include, for example, materials with form memory elements. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1ae/e85/363/1aee8536386b8e667704118b231c165b.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Security specialist in nanoindustry.</b>  Responsible for the safety of field workers, end users of the product and the environment.  Develops programs to quickly respond to the negative effects of the production / use of nanoproducts <br>  Another specialist who takes into account in his work the framework of the entire life cycle of an integrated system.  But this time it is a person who foresees and warns possible environmental and technological disasters associated with the development of technology. <br><br><h5>  Ecology </h5><br>  In the coming decades, environmental monitoring and the introduction of more environmentally friendly practices will become a mandatory part of work in all sectors of industry and transport.  In the coming years, the main task of ecologists is to develop environmental awareness in the society - to support those who care for the environment, and to disseminate best practices. <br>  Accordingly, in this sector, the main role will be played by the control of environmental changes, the development of recycling technologies in most industries and the planning of projects and programs taking into account full-cycle technologies (from product design to its use and recycling or disposal). <br><br>  <i>Professions that will appear until 2020</i> <br>  <b>Eco Auditor.</b>  A specialist who audits industrial enterprises and makes recommendations on reducing the environmental impact due to the modernization of production, changing practices and ways of working. <br>  In principle, this profession already exists, environmental auditing has been used in Russia since 1993.  I already wrote about the audit of ports in the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/216567/">post about transport</a> , there are a number of other examples.  Thus, Atlas, rather simply institutionalizes this profession.  Today, the virtually absent legal framework hinders the development of the industry, and modern legal norms prevent environmentalists from working.  In addition, enterprises have no interest in participating in the training of specialists.  And enterprises conduct a closed environmental policy, which does not promote the exchange of experience and training of specialists. <br><br>  <b>Recycling technologist.</b>  Specialist in the development and implementation of materials reuse technologies, as well as the development of waste-free production technologies <br>  Lean manufacturing is entering our lives, although in Russia it is still too slow.  In the West, there are a large number of examples of the use of materials reuse technologies.  For example, Victor Monserratt invented the ‚Äúrecycling bike‚Äù - a machine that turns plastic waste into a thread that can be used to <a href="http://vmdesign.org/">make furniture, etc.</a>  Dan McLaughlin from New Zealand found out that wool waste from carpet manufacturers is about 7% and launched the production of "bio-wool" (biowool) from waste with the addition of bioresin. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/078/7df/68c/0787df68c773f577c5aee8f85985e7b9.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Ecopriology.</b>  A specialist who develops and conducts educational and outreach programs for children and adults in lifestyles associated with reducing the burden on the environment (non-use, separate garbage collection, environmentally conscious lifestyles, etc.), as well as programs for industrial enterprises for more eco-friendly production practices. <br>  The creators of the Atlas believe that environmental education should be continuous.  "The full cycle and practical application of the knowledge gained is necessary to create an environment for people who can conserve natural resources and popularize the principles of lean environmental management." So here, of course, the preacher is rather an educator and visionary. <br><br>  <b>Park ecologist.</b>  This is a professional whose task is to monitor and analyze the ecological state of public spaces (parks, squares, squares, alleys, etc.), develop and implement solutions for gardening, settling the territory with animals, birds, insects and other measures to maintain the ecological balance on green area inside the city. <br>  Rather, this profession should be called ‚Äúurban ecologist‚Äù, at least specialists in urban ecology have existed since the 1970s.  Of course, the tasks of urban ecologists are much broader than the monitoring of public gardens and avenues.  Today, at the request of "urban ecology", there are mainly enthusiastic sites and abstracts in the search, but it is hoped that the situation will change in the near future. <br><br>  <b>Specialist in overcoming systemic environmental disasters.</b>  An engineer working with disasters stretched over time that people gradually realize, such as pollution around large industrial centers, Pacific plastic landfill, melting permafrost, radiation landfills, etc. His task is to develop and implement programs to deal with consequences and prevent repetitions of such disasters <br>  There is a whole block of environmental problems that have only recently begun to worry people.  A prime example is the <a href="http://goo.gl/LqjMk">Pacific large trash patch</a> .  Due to ocean currents in the territory, according to various estimates, it takes from 0.7 to 15 million square meters.  km is over 100 million tons of garbage.  The existence of the spot was predicted in 1988, and in 1997 it was discovered.  A stain that does not look like a garbage dump, but represents small particles of plastic in the water.  These particles can be toxic and get into the food of fish and jellyfish.  If you do not fight (and more importantly, to warn) such situations, an ecological disaster may unfold, to which you can no longer be treated, just like an article in Wikipedia. <br><br>  <i>Professions that will appear after 2020</i> <br>  <b>Eco lead</b>  A specialist who supports proactive community groups working to improve the environment provides for the exchange of information between them, helps them organize public control of production and monitoring the behavior of people on the ground (in cities / villages). <br>  A significant number of people are <b>in principle</b> willing to participate in any environmental activity, but they often lack a person who would say what needs to be done, where it is necessary and help with the organization of this activity.  Such activities are <a href="http://lrpg-ecology.livejournal.com/">already carried out by</a> individual activists who gather volunteers around themselves, however, it is clear that more such specialists will be needed. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/218505/">https://habr.com/ru/post/218505/</a></p>
