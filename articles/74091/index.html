  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Wikiproject Overview</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Currently, the Russian-language Internet is actively developing the wiki technology, which means that each visitor can edit the contents of the site, put forward their proposals for the development of articles, and, based on consensus with other editors, determine the content of the pages, with special privileges in managing the site have administrators, but usually they must obey the rules of the site.  If at one time from a number of well-known projects there was one Wikipedia, now there are a large number of both universal and highly specialized projects covering questions of a wide variety of subjects. <br><br>  In this article, we present you an overview of the most famous Russian-language wiki projects: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Wikimedia Foundation Projects </h4><br><br>  The most famous projects of the non-profit Wikimedia Foundation - in particular, he owns the well-known giant Internet encyclopedia "Wikipedia" and a number of some smaller complementary resources.  The main projects of the Foundation are multilingual, almost all of them contain sections in Russian, and they are made on the basis of the famous MediaWiki engine.  So, they include:

    <h5>  Wikipedia (Russian) </h5><br>  <i><a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/">ru.wikipedia.org</a></i> <br><br>  Free encyclopedia that anyone can edit.  The project has quite strict rules for writing articles, in particular the need to specify verifiable sources and ensure the licensed purity of the content.  Currently, the Russian section contains ~ 450,000 articles on various topics, of which 872 received the status of good, and 315 - the status of the elect.  Now new articles are actively developed, new articles are being written and finalized, the project is in the stage of a wikipedia.  The system of marking versions as verified has been implemented; the reader can choose himself whether to read the latest version of the article or the checked one (if there is one).  At the same time, the Russian Wikipedia is criticized for its unique atmosphere and in some places draconian order, as well as for a significant lag behind a number of other sections, the largest of which is English-speaking with more than 3 million articles. <br><br><h5>  Wikisource (Russian) </h5><br>  <i><a href="http://ru.wikisource.org/">ru.wikisource.org</a></i> <br><br>  The second in terms of the development project of the Foundation is a library of texts not protected by copyright.  Currently, the database of the Russian part contains more than 67,000 texts.  Participants who are also familiar with Wikipedia are actively developing the project, they fill up the classic Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Brockhaus and Efron (ESBE) using bots (programs for automation of edits), host numerous other free works, including various texts of laws.  As in Wikipedia, there is a system for marking individual versions of articles as verified. <br><br><h5>  Wikimedia Commons </h5><br>  <i><a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/">commons.wikimedia.org</a></i> <br><br>  A large collection of free media files that can be used in all other projects of the Foundation, and in any wiki projects with the latest versions of the MediaWiki engine.  The site contains more than 5 million images, anyone can upload files to Wikimedia Commons after registration (the only restriction is that these files must be free, and their description is properly executed).  These files are free to use, distribute and modify. <br><br><h5>  Other projects </h5><br><br>  So far, Russian-speaking projects that have not received proper development are (Russian) Wikinews (a free news agency, currently being developed mainly by anonymous and some volunteers), Russian Wiktionary (essentially a dictionary of Russian words and expressions), Russian Wikiquote (collection of quotes in Russian) , Russian Wikibooks (collection of various Russian-language literature for training, after the expulsion of one of the founders of Ramir from there, almost does not develop). <br><br><h4>  Alternative Russian wiki projects </h4><br><br><h5>  Universal: </h5><br><br><h5>  Letopisi.Ru </h5><br>  <i><a href="http://letopisi.ru/">letopisi.ru</a></i> <br><br>  A wiki project that positions itself as an encyclopedia for schoolchildren, designed to master the wiki technology.  Contains a significant number of articles, a fair amount of which is designed to test the capabilities of the wiki.  The project collaborates with Wikipedia. <br><br><h5>  Tradition </h5><br>  <i><a href="http://traditio.ru/">traditio.ru</a></i> <br><br>  The main alternative to the Russian-language Wikipedia is the wiki-project, which has a pronounced nationalist bias due to the policies of its founders - one of the leaders of contemporary Russian nationalism, writer, philosopher and blogger Konstantin Krylov and his colleague Sergei Nesterovich.  Special emphasis in the project is placed on Russian nationalism and the entities connected with it, but at the same time there is a lot of natural science, reference material and general topics.  Contains a number of articles copied from Russian Wikipedia, including many articles deleted from there.  In addition to encyclopedic articles in the project a lot of copyright materials, mainly nationalistic.  Currently, the project contains about 22 thousand articles, that is, 20 times less than in the Russian Wikipedia, and yet it is one of the few Russian-speaking competitors. <br><br><h5>  ENE </h5><br>  <i><a href="http://wiki.laser.ru/">wiki.laser.ru</a></i> <br><br>  Free scientific encyclopedia, created and maintained mainly by one person - the famous wikipedist and wiki-dissident Evgen2.  Most of the articles are information transferred from old encyclopedias: ESBE, Malaya Sovetskaya Encyclopedia, and others, from the WikiKnowledge wiki site, as well as articles deleted from Wikipedia and their own articles written by Evgen2. <br><br><h5>  Wicking </h5><br>  <i><a href="http://wikiznanie.ru/">wikiznanie.ru</a></i> <br><br>  Wiknowledge, once a real competitor to Russian Wikipedia, is now in a deep stagnation and practically does not develop.  Nevertheless, it contains a significant number of articles, mostly filled with ESBE and has a decent attendance, representing a source for advertising revenue for its owners. <br><br><h5>  Specialized: </h5><br><br><h5>  Lurkomore </h5><br>  <i><a href="http://lurkmore.ru/">lurkmore.ru</a></i> <br><br>  The Internet Encyclopedia, written in the spirit of nihilism and postmodernism, contains articles about famous memes, incidents that have happened on the web, and other similar information.  Most of the articles have a complete look, there are almost no blank articles, and they are quickly removed.  The project materials contain sometimes witty, sometimes evil satire and criticism of almost all other Russian wiki projects, various phenomena and Internet figures, and are very popular in runet, often quoted.  The site adopted the use of special vocabulary, including deviant, excessive use of which, however, try to avoid and remove from the articles. <br><br><h5>  Wikimapia </h5><br>  <i><a href="http://wikimapia.org/">wikimapia.org</a></i> <br><br>  Perhaps the most successful wiki project of Russian origin.  It is a multilingual description of various geographical objects on Google Maps.  Made on a special engine.  It has a huge popularity and attendance, it has more than 10 million descriptions.  Founded by Alexander Koryakin and Evgeny Saveliev.  It is not clear how large corporations have not bought Wikimapia so far. <br><br><h5>  Rodovod (Russian section) </h5><br>  <i><a href="http://ru.rodovid.org/">ru.rodovid.org</a></i> <br><br>  Collection of genealogical descriptions based on the Mediawiki engine with a special superstructure.  Allows you to build your beautiful or someone else's family trees and is actively developing. <br><br><h5>  Anti-copyright </h5><br>  <i><a href="http://anticopyright.ru/">anticopyright.ru</a></i> <br><br>  A site created in support of the ‚Äúanti-copyright‚Äù movement for the abolition of the main provisions of modern copyright law.  Most of the articles are about copyright and the movement to fight for its liberalization, there are articles about important figures and projects of wikisreda, about censorship, interesting lawsuits, etc. The project materials express the author‚Äôs position of the site owners, including administrators are well-known wikipedists.  Supervised by the patriarch of Runet Misha Verbitsky. <br><br><h5>  Provisoria </h5><br>  <i><a href="http://provizorii.ru/">provizorii.ru</a></i> <br><br>  This is an example of a highly specialized wiki encyclopedia created to describe everything related to philately and mail.  The founder and principal author of the project is the well-known philatelist-researcher, wikipedist and dissident wiki Anatoly Serebryakov (Serebr).  It contains his own research on the modern history of the Russian Post and the so-called ‚Äúfood stores‚Äù, as well as a significant number of materials copied from other encyclopedias (mainly from Wikipedia) related to philately.  There are more than 2000 articles in the project. <br><br><h5>  Wikreality </h5><br>  <i><a href="http://wikireality.ru/">wikireality.ru</a></i> <br><br>  A young developing site dedicated to a detailed description of the wikisreda, mainly its Russian-language part.  An overview of the main Russian-language wiki projects, and the most famous multilingual wiki sites.  A special place is given to an alternative description of the history of Russian Wikipedia.  In some places it contains criticism in the spirit of Lurkomore, which in general is still more neutral and ‚Äúacademic‚Äù.  The theme of the site is limited only to the wiki environment (in the future we plan to smoothly expand the scope and description of the entire Web 2.0)  In addition to encyclopedic articles, Wikipedist studies, including ‚Äúwiki-conspirology‚Äù, well-known sayings, MediaWiki documentation, and autonomous projects are published.  The creators of the site are anonymous, most likely they are wiki-dissidents who were expelled from the Russian Wikipedia. <br><br>  Any comments and suggestions are welcome. <br><br>  The authors of the review Benjamin Linus (linus@wikireality.ru, while without an account on Habr√©) is one of the founders of Wikireality, and Anatoly Serebryakov ( <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/serebr/" class="user_link">Serebr</a> ) is the founder of Provisionis. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/74091/">https://habr.com/ru/post/74091/</a></p>
