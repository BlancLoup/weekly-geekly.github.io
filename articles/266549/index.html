However, some data sometimes <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/266093/">gets out</a> .  This time, another case, about how the doctors Cedars Sinai Medical Center unanimously rejected the new system. <br><br>  If you read the previous article on the same topic, then guess from one time who will again appear as a system developer. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  And so in order.  Cedars Sinai Medical Center, located in Los Angeles, spent $ 34 million (US dollars) to develop and implement a system for entering a drug order, laboratories and procedures (according to 2005 data).

      As a result of ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù computerization, practitioners have found that they now spend much <s>less</s> time using a computer than the same actions in paper-based documents.  While their weekly schedule was already 80 hours, packed to capacity, the use of the new system meant additional time.  It was also found that the system imposes severe restrictions on their ability to make medical decisions.  To add fuel to the fire, the system did not recognize words with small misprints, and doctors daily encountered an avalanche of additional questions, reminders and warnings generated by the system.  After numerous attempts to take this fortress, several hundred doctors refused to use the system and the administration of the center was forced to collapse it.  I must say that all this happened in one of the most <a href="http://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/area/ca/cedars-sinai-medical-center-6930444">advanced</a> US <a href="http://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/area/ca/cedars-sinai-medical-center-6930444">clinics</a> . <br><br>  Not far from Cedars Sinai, there was Kaiser Health Plan, where, with the help of IBM, they tried to implement their own Clinical Information System with the same efforts.  A Kaiser study published in their Hawaiian unit revealed numerous problems, among which a serious decrease in the productivity of medical personnel was a key factor.  To be more precise, the doctors had to spend an extra 30 to 75 minutes a day to complete the same amount of work.  And all this after the initial training of working with the system. <br><br>  Obviously, this CIS also went to the dump of IT history and in 2006 Kaiser began to ‚Äúcostum‚Äù EMR from Epic.  Unfortunately for Kaiser, the introduction of this system also proceeded with a big creak, so it is quite likely that this attempt was blacklisted.  And as the statistics show, 30% of all EMR implementations are completed (according to 2005 data). <br><br>  According to some authors of studies on this topic, doctors do not understand their happiness and are not ready to use systems that require more time to perform the same tasks.  ‚Äú <i>This is a result of the EMRs that have been over-engineered.</i>  ‚Äù(Brown, 2005, p. 47) And if one gets used to good quickly, then getting used to bad takes from 6 to 12 months before the doctors forget how they worked before and fully switch to the new pace of work .  ‚Äú <i>Even after training, physicians are often less productive because the EMR slows them down.</i>  (Tipirneni, 2006). <br><br>  However, all authors of studies recognize that the productivity of work drops significantly.  Thus, in the examples above, the doctors at Cedars Sinai faced considerable time spent on the same tasks and too much additional information.  Doctors at Kaiser paid attention to a significant decrease in productivity, even after very long training in working with the new system. <br><br>  The original article is available here - <a href="http://uxpajournal.org/usability-of-electronic-medical-records/">uxpajournal.org/usability-of-electronic-medical-records</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/266549/">https://habr.com/ru/post/266549/</a></p>
