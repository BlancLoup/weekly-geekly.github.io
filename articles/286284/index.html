  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Inventory in the company</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  All Habr! <br><br>  I work in a small company.  The other day we had an unpleasant event - the office was robbed.  Trite to the obscene - just climbed out the window and carried a few laptops, as well as tablets and a soap dish.  By the way, a number of tablets were lying around, including ipad2, a DSLR and an expensive quadrocopter.  But judging by the dirty track of the shoes abibas, the thieves were not very educated. <br><br>  Having learned about what happened, we called the police.  The investigator arrived, examined the scene of the incident and proceeded to the investigation: which laptops were missing, what serial numbers they had ... Alas, none of us had the idea that one day we would need this information.  Our answer was in the spirit of a perhydrol diva - "brown asuses".  Need I say that the investigator was a little discouraged by this answer?  Yes, and "brown asusy" sunk into oblivion.  We looked at Avito, other sites, but to no avail. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The harsh reality forced us to admit the unfavorable fact - negligence reigns in the company: there is no person responsible for inventory, the number of office equipment in the company is a mythical figure.  Any person, whether an employee or just passing by, could endure the vending technique and we would hardly have noticed the loss.

      Responsible for inventory has been assigned.  He went around the office and recorded information about the remaining technology in the excel file.  Considering that we are an IT company and are engaged in software development ourselves, this approach surprised everyone) Including the person in charge. <br><br>  And then the thought came to me: ‚ÄúWhy not write an application in which you can keep inventory records, monitor their status and know from which employee which laptop is in use?‚Äù. <br>  Over the course of a few days, I <a href="http://steppler.ru/">added functionality</a> , but the interface did not please: it turned out to be a regular admin panel - some tables.  Podshamanil made some styles from <a href="http://designmodo.github.io/Flat-UI/">FLAT UI</a> , hooked up the <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">backbone</a> and got a one-page application that works much faster and looks more decent. <br><br> <a href="http://steppler.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e3d/1ff/bb2/e3d1ffbb2873412cbdeb3ad04babe67c.png"></a> <br><br>  The functionality at the moment is simple: adding inventory (its cost, payer, description), in which office the inventory is located, who uses it.  Plus, there is the possibility of maintaining employees. <br>  There are a lot of plans, a mobile developer of the company became interested in the software, offered to write an application that would help fix the whole thing and keep track of the inventory.  Now we are looking towards printers that can print stickers with qr-code.  An acquaintance from a large company suggested radio tags, they say when large warehouses, it is much easier to search for the necessary inventory by radio tag. <br><br>  <a href="http://steppler.ru/">I will be glad</a> to listen to all the criticism and find out how your company solves such problems?  Maybe someone has interesting ideas or suggestions for improvement. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/286284/">https://habr.com/ru/post/286284/</a></p>
