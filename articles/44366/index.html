      The first answer from Sberbank: <br><blockquote>  From: Online Public Relations Department <br>  Sent: Thursday, October 23, 2008 2:31 PM <br>  To: Department of technology and customer service UBC <br>  Subject: FW: Letter from the site: on the Maestro map <br><br>  <font color="blue">Dear Dmitry!</font> <font color="blue"><br><br></font>  <font color="blue">I send you the details for transferring funds to your card.</font>  <font color="blue">It is (for future) posted on the Bank‚Äôs website.</font> <br></blockquote><br><br>  Needless to say that they have not sent any details?  And how about the fact that the letter did not answer any of my questions?  And is it worth paying attention to errors in the text? <br><br>  But it is easy to forgive, because  5 minutes later I received another letter, attention, here it is: <br><br>  The second letter from Sberbank: <br><br><blockquote>  <font color="blue">Dear Dmitry!</font> <font color="blue"><br><br></font>  <font color="blue">I send you the details for transferring funds to your card.</font>  <font color="blue">It (for the future) is available on the Bank‚Äôs website <a href="http://www.szb.sbrf.ru/">www.szb.sbrf.ru.</a></font>  <font color="blue">The card has its number, but you can find out the account measures at the Bank or the Customer Service by calling (812) 3292929 or 88003330088. As for the design, it is the only one for the Maestro card.</font> <font color="blue"><br><br></font>  <font color="blue">Customer service.</font>  <font color="blue">Operator 56.</font> <br></blockquote><br><br>  Well, in the second letter I actually received the file with the details, but the letter itself is a class.  It should be read as an interesting book, or rather as a bashorg.  I repeat - these are the original copies of those two letters, and even the blue color is preserved from the original source. <br><br>  For some reason, in the second letter there is no heading with the fields ‚ÄúFrom‚Äù, ‚ÄúSent‚Äù, ‚ÄúTo‚Äù and ‚ÄúSubject‚Äù, where the ‚ÄúInternet of the Department‚Äù is proudly written, although I always thought that such a department would be written through a dash. <br><br>  But I stuck to the little things - this content of the second letter is much steeper - I always have thousands of mistakes in the text, but here there are a million of them :-) Everyone is fighting for a corporate style, artificial and without a soul, and here we see that we were answered alive man, and that's a plus. <br><br>  As long as we have such a bank, we are invincible!  No crisis to us is a hindrance.  And advertisements of Sberbank on billboards and TV (television commercials are a separate topic of conversation) are just fantastic, positive for the whole day, Sberbank: ‚ÄúI surely believe you,‚Äù says their famous poster. <br><br>  Oh shit!  They sent the 3rd letter (this is the answer to my question about the difference between Electron and Maestro): <br><br><blockquote>  Good day! <br><br>  Visa Electron and Maestro cards are electronic presentation cards, operations are possible only with the presentation of the magnetic stripe of the card.  They have a not so wide geography of service in comparison with classic cards Visa Classic and Mastercard.  The latter provide the ability to conduct operations booking, operations on the Internet, are considered high-class service cards.  Details are available on our website <a href="http://www.sberbsnk.ru/">www.sberbsnk.ru</a> . <br>  As for the design, now the choice of card design is not possible. <br><br>  Customer service. <br></blockquote><br><br>  No hello, no goodbye!  Boom - and the answer, but why now the font is not blue?  And why is it not specified what kind of operator was responsible, and where is the "cap" in the letter?  But all these letters are united by one thing - mistakes!  Here they are: <br><ul><li>  "Operations" </li><li>  "Presentation" </li><li>  "Armored" </li><li>  "High class" </li><li>  "Repent" </li></ul><br>  And the most hit is an error in the address of their site, look at what the operator writes: " <i>In detail, there are opportunities on our site <a href="http://www.sberbsnk.ru/">www.sberbsnk.ru</a></i> " (in general, this phrase should be written in gold letters under their logo) But what is this <a href="http://www.sberbsnk.ru/">www.sberbsnk.ru</a> such ?  This is just a crystal clear absurdity.  This is how their ‚ÄúInternet Department‚Äù works ... <br><br>  I repeat: I can confirm all this in fact all the letters have been saved in my email. <br><br>  Sberbaaaaank, wake up! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/44366/">https://habr.com/ru/post/44366/</a></p>
