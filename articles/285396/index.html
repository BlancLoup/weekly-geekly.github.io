  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Staff recruitment for startups</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This article will contain both advice to those who select and those who select.  Immediately make a reservation, under the startup I understand the project to create something new on the Internet with a budget of 30 million rubles for the first three months. <br><br>  The tips in the article will be useful to those who are either starting their IT career or are thinking about changing jobs.  I will say at once that good IT specialists either have to be rudely head-hunted from their current jobs (which is not very ethical, but extremely funny), or bring them up almost from scratch. <br>  So, the article will talk about tips for beginners and not so IT specialists. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First, I will debunk a myth: there are few cool IT specialists in Russia.  The second myth is that IT salaries are lower than the world average. <br><br>  1. There are specialists in Russia, they are just not doing so - a cool developer with a lot of experience and great potential (Mehmat has finished) can easily be an enikeyschik for 50-100 thousand and enjoy life.  And it‚Äôs good if they are an enikeyshchik, they are looking for a job as a copywriter (one such fighter quite seriously came to settle down as a database operator). <br>  2. Salaries in Moscow are higher for a programmer - in Europe, with three years of experience, Pkhpshnik is valued at no more than 1,500-2,000 dollars, in Moscow and St. Petersburg they are offered 80,000 or more. <br>  One of the key typical Russian problems is the lack of specialization.  In a certain sense, the lack of specialization is good, but if you need to find a specialist with knowledge of how high-loaded clusters work and additionally understanding the principles of OOP, you will encounter many problems. <br>  Now actually to the tips: <br>  1. Book 1001 PHP pages do not make you a harsh bearded developer.  The feeling will give, yes, but that will not do.  Therefore, reading books helps, but systematic education is still much better.  Here you can not do without specific knowledge. <br>  Courses - the basics of programming and C ++ are also not an assistant.  More precisely, in Russia, due to the absence of employees of this class, this may be the case ‚Äî but in the West they will not appreciate you.  So that everything does not go to India, you have to learn.

      2. We have few HR distinguishing the framework from the parser, so our CV should be written in two versions - for HR and for the head of the IT department.  The perfect resume looks like a portfolio with a brief description of what technologies you own, what you mastered at your previous job, what you learned.  Do not give links to unfinished work. <br><br>  3. Knowledge of hardware.  As in the famous joke, the materiel must be taught, for ignorance they are beaten.  Why?  The reason is simple - the manager can spend on you ideally, if one hour, and he should not admire the genius of the solutions you have implemented: he can only check the knowledge that HR is not able to check. <br><br>  4. Training.  Please do not write "quickly master new technology."  Not a single person who really mastered quickly, has ever met in her life.  Yes, and do not need to learn quickly.  Therefore, about learning - write simply - during such work such and such technologies have been mastered.  It will say a lot more than all the certificates combined. <br><br>  5. Fear Enikeystva.  Those.  Do not do 6 projects at the same time, if you are not a team lead, of course.  Another problem is connected with enikeyschiki - confidence in a lot of experience in the implementation of any projects. <br>  The experience may be great, but only here we come across the next important point. <br>  For example, HR says: we are engaged in the development of logistics software for the iPad.  It is great if you dealt with this, but the phrase ‚ÄúI have a lot of experience in the field of logistics‚Äù is scary.  The point here is not that someone doubts your knowledge, but that the start-up market is very competitive and the arrival of a competitor‚Äôs employee for an interview for the purpose of intelligence is a common thing. <br><br>  6. Call the real salary for which you are willing to work and if you need to linger after work, go out on Saturday-Sunday, then receive double compensations and rest days.  This means that if you want to sit in a quiet place for 80 thousand, and really your knowledge is 120, you should not be offended if you are refused after 4 interviews.  In the process of interviewing the leadership in the head will sit one thought: the candidate is a fool or does not know anything?  Even a difference of 20 thousand on average in the market forces one to strain, a difference of more than 30% makes one think of competitive intelligence. <br><br>  7. One of the myths is that the goal of a startup is to make a profit, so all expenses must be reduced.  Making money is the goal of a startup in exceptional cases, in most large startups the goal is to successfully invest money with a constant income. <br>  This is one of the problems of all beginners PM - they want to optimize (and actually reduce) staff costs.  The reality is harsh - they are denied, they are expelled.  I repeat once again - in exceptional cases, the goal of a startup is profit.  In most cases - the creation of a mechanism for the sustainable receipt of money. <br>  Hence the rule for PM: call the real costs that you incur for the staff as the team leader, you should not downplay them, and equally overestimate them. <br><br>  8. For PMov.  Each manager has different requirements: someone needs knowledge of PMI, someone needs scram and ajail.  At the same time, knowing the definition of a project (a project is ...) is still required, although it is not uncommon for managers to hire those who can quickly get involved in the topic, rather than people who can write a book about differences in scrum and agile approach. <br><br>  9. The most important advice: if you are invited to LLC ‚ÄúFunny Name‚Äù do not be lazy to look on the Internet, what kind of company is this.  So it may be that an LLC hides an organization where the salary of the company's president is several times higher than the annual revenue of your previous place of work. <br><br>  10. A good HR will always take an interest in your salary expectations; if not, it is never harmful to ask him a few questions about work, including wages. <br><br>  11. A good advantage is having your own site, sure minus - if the time of updating the site coincides with the working time. <br><br>  If you like it, in the next article I will talk about recruitment with specific examples. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285396/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285396/</a></p>
