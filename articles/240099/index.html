      Design and modernity <br><br>  The interesting thing is that the console will not go unnoticed.  If you want to stand out from the crowd, this is what you need!  people come up and ask, what is it?  What can you play?  Several girls said that they had such a phone in their childhood, and it was convenient to call on it (probably, it meant a folding bed / shell). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9c1/ba6/c5e/9c1ba6c5e6184a0195a4069cb4a08aa2.png"><br><br>  The unusual design of the console attracts attention, then how not to twist!  I surprised many of my peers with an acquisition, but most of them also immediately wanted to buy a prefix with the words: ‚ÄúWow, this is gbashka!  Where did you get it? ‚Äù <br><br>  Display <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/385/476/0b1/3854760b12aa43a1b301dc7699dc68f2.png" align="right"><br>  The device has a 3 '' LCD display with a resolution of 320x240. <br>  The screen is bright, for the years that have passed since the release of the first GBA, SP technologies have stepped forward, and in this model of the hardware clone a more modern and better display is used. <br><br>  ‚ñåGames <br><br>  In the photo there are cartridges with games for an amount equal to that spent on the console itself with a 999in1 cartridge.  Cartridges with games in our city are no longer to be found, only under the order or online stores, so it makes sense to take a console with a collection cartridge. <br><br>  999in1 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b4c/481/cda/b4c481cda7864771aee746484b316854.png" align="left">  On the cartridge itself there are about 60 GBA games, the rest of the NES to GBA are converted games, by the number of games this is the same cartridge 200in1 as for similar consoles. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Look at the cartridge without clothes in high resolution?</b>  <b class="spoiler_title">Caution!</b>  <b class="spoiler_title">Traffic!</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/169/415/14c/16941514cf654f8d886718723c0ee2f1.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e9c/524/833/e9c52483399d47528a84485a93e98893.JPG"><br></div></div><br><br>  Games set in the console.  Favorite classic Dandy games: Mario, Tanki, Captain America, Bateltoads, Bomberman, Castelvania, Chip and Dale, Contra, yes, there is even a noodle and Tetris, which perfectly complement this prefix. <br><br>  Game Game Advance from the 999in1 collection, which I liked: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/GPO3xFAZUJU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgKEMe0YJNFKW3yTPrkwn1H1hBRGg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Undocumented features:</b> <br>  The brightness change button has not only 5 gradations, but also with a long hold (5 seconds), it can put the device to sleep to save battery power.  This function does not just turn off the display backlight, but actually stops the device, for example, when launching GBA games during intro playback, hold down the key, put the device to sleep, and after a while we awaken, and the intro plays from the moment it stopped.  It seems a trifle, but nice! <br><br>  I would like to talk about the volume of the sound in more detail, since not every day this happens.  The volume is more than sufficient, during the recording of the video, I realized that in some games the volume should not be maximized at all, otherwise it cuts my ears, I will not deny that I have not heard such volume in quite a while on portable devices.  The location of the dynamics, of course, pleases, the console was developed not by fools, but by Nintendo itself. <br><br>  ‚ñåBattery and charging <br>  Opening hours - full portability! <br>  Unlike the same omnipresent Android, here you will have not a couple of hours, but 6-8 on one charge easily! <br><br>  The battery itself is this: <br>  TX 3.7V 800mAh <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1ec/1f5/719/1ec1f57191244d7cb4f8ff30a39ad332.png"><br><br>  Network Charger: <br>  TX 5,2V 320mAh <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/489/d85/67c/489d8567c09f45f5a5d933422e9c8448.png"><br><br>  ‚ñåConclusion <br>  This console is for those who "remember" or just looking for a worthy replacement for emulators. <br>  For children and parents who do not want to engage in setting up, downloading games and other things in this spirit.  For those who need portability and network independence. <br>  Lots of cartridge games are another nice bonus! <br><br>  ‚ñåPrice and purchase <br>  Prices are different, varied.  In retail, a similar model with 200 games costs more than 2000 rubles, while being an emulator, which is not very good.  EXEQ GAMEBOX, on the contrary, costs between 800-1200 rubles and is not an emulator - this is good, since compatibility with games is an order of magnitude higher. <br><br>  ‚ñåColor differentiation of pants <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/114/433/180/1144331807ee49fd9162321c3026311a.jpg"><br><br>  Well what can I say, the color palette is extensive, the prefix is ‚Äã‚Äãpresented in the following colors: white, blue, red, green, pink, orange, black, purple, blue, silver. <br>  But this is not all, for example, my model is listed as an emerald, so the list of colors is far from complete, color solutions are constantly supplemented with new variants. <br><br>  I'm not proud, not the original, but a wonderful replica.  Here is my baby, isn‚Äôt she beautiful? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ab6/5e2/8ba/ab65e28ba0c74aea96ab9f7d41658302.png"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.exeq.ru/produkcija/pristavki/detskie/gamebox.html">Information on the official website of the manufacturer.</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/240099/">https://habr.com/ru/post/240099/</a></p>
