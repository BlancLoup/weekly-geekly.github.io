As always, we interviewed the users of <a href="http://moikrug.ru/">‚ÄúMy Circle‚Äù</a> and ‚ÄúHabrakhabr‚Äù; more than 2,200 people took part in the survey. <br><br>  The survey took place 3 weeks before the New Year and consisted of two parts: in the first part, we found out how IT specialists celebrate the New Year personally, and in the second, how they celebrate the New Year holiday in companies. <br><br>  It turned out that for IT professionals, the New Year is a traditional family and home holiday, on which it is customary to set up a Christmas tree, cook Olivier, drink champagne and watch the congratulations of the president.  At the same time there are small geographic and professional nuances.

      In most companies, it is customary to celebrate the holiday with a New Year's corporate party, which most often takes place in a restaurant, with alcohol and top management.  Also in the companies there is a developed tradition of setting up a Christmas tree and congratulating the employees and customers with gifts. <br><br>  For all the details and infographics, welcome to the publication. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/moikrug/blog/318488/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/255/bf7/511/255bf7511e124bb3b87d6f72f9087edc.png" alt="image"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><hr><br><h2>  <b>Introduction</b>  <b>Portrait of a survey participant</b> </h2><br>  We begin, traditionally, with a brief description of a participant in our survey. <br><br><blockquote><h3>  What is your current specialization? </h3></blockquote><br>  80% of our IT audience are developers, testers and administrators. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ed1/c60/b8d/ed1c60b8d9c547a78857597aa84c9849.png" alt="image"><br><hr><br><blockquote><h3>  What type of company do you work for? <br>  What region is your office located in? </h3></blockquote><br>  Most of our audience works in small private companies.  Slightly less employed in large private companies.  One third of all specialists are concentrated in Moscow.  Another third is in St. Petersburg and the million-plus cities. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/054/2b5/90e/0542b590e70b4b22980473e191554a94.png" alt="image"><br><br>  However, on closer examination, we see that employment in large companies prevails in capitals, and in small companies in the provinces.  Employment in the public sector is slightly more common in the regions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fca/f7d/f69/fcaf7df6928f4ad7b0f3d7a20e846de7.png" alt="image"><br><hr><br><blockquote><h2>  <b>Part one.</b>  <b>Individual celebration of the New Year</b> </h2></blockquote><br>  We now turn to the actual survey itself.  Let's start with the celebration of each separately. <br><br><blockquote><h3>  Will you personally celebrate the New Year? <br>  How do you feel about such long holidays? </h3></blockquote><br>  The vast majority, almost 90% of respondents, celebrate the New Year.  All further questions about the nuances of the celebration were asked only to them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/62f/fcc/21a/62ffcc21a8784bc2aec12e7b110f846d.png" alt="image"><br><hr><br><blockquote><h3>  Where geographically and geographically are you going to celebrate New Year? </h3></blockquote><br>  The New Year is a ‚Äúhome‚Äù holiday: the overwhelming majority celebrates this holiday in their hometown in their apartment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c05/773/247/c057732475354ffbb9cdcad23ec5d2a7.png" alt="image"><br><hr><br><blockquote><h3>  Who will you celebrate New Year? </h3></blockquote><br>  New Year is still - mostly a family holiday. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/530/8f2/0f0/5308f20f040a47ea9d5e0db7a069ac47.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In the CIS countries, as well as in other countries, New Year is celebrated with relatives more rarely and with friends more often than in other places.  In other countries, a little more people are spending the New Year alone.  IT scholars, as well as administrators and software developers, often prefer to celebrate New Year with their family a little more often than IT developers, as well as sales people.  Among salespeople and managers most often there are people spending the New Year alone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d10/876/1f1/d108761f178748d2aeb63a38dbeb1665.png" alt="image"><br><hr><br><blockquote><h3>  Do you put a Christmas tree in the New Year? </h3></blockquote><br>  Of those who celebrate the New Year, the vast majority install the Christmas tree.  A living tree is only one of the three;  most are artificial. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c76/674/d04/c76674d041424296ae4264a286282bc8.png" alt="image"><br><br>  There are small regional and professional features.  Abroad, our people put living trees and branches a little more often than others, in Moscow - slightly less often than others.  IT scholars, as well as testers and application developers, prefer living trees a little more often than IT developers, along with sales people. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/27c/545/d9f/27c545d9f352493f8b53d1a414ae58aa.png" alt="image"><br><hr><br><blockquote><h3>  Which of the following traditions do you support? </h3></blockquote><br>  Salad "Olivier", champagne and New Year's congratulations to the president - the strongest New Year's traditions, which are supported by the overwhelming majority! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ef2/3d6/d28/ef23d6d28a3a4ad2826baf3ead9eb693.png" alt="image"><br><hr><br><blockquote><h3>  What are you planning to do during the Christmas holidays? <br>  Will you take a vacation to double the rest? </h3></blockquote><br>  Most prefer to spend the New Year with the family.  The practice of adding holidays to holidays is not too common. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/30a/c3f/60e/30ac3f60ecd84c02a12699b209e17f50.png" alt="image"><br><hr><br><h2>  <b>Part two.</b>  <b>Corporate celebration of the New Year</b> </h2><br>  We turn to the second part of our survey, in which we find out how to celebrate the New Year in IT companies. <br><br><blockquote><h3>  Will your company have a New Year's corporate party? <br>  Will there be a separate event for children? </h3></blockquote><br>  At least two of the three companies hold a New Year's corporate event.  At least one of the five companies is an additional holiday for the children of employees. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b6f/81b/1d4/b6f81b1d4cd6472db0c806bd531b1b84.png" alt="image"><br><br>  New Year's corporate party is more often carried out in large private companies, and less often in startups.  In foreign countries, New Year's corporate events are less common than in Russia or the CIS countries.  Curiously, in Moscow, New Year's corporate events are held less frequently than in other cities, although it is in the capital, as we saw earlier, that are most employed in large private companies, and here one would expect the greatest frequency of corporate events.  What else is characteristic, in Moscow, the greatest percentage of uncertainty about corporate life: three weeks before the New Year, many here still do not know whether it will pass at all. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/235/d70/849/235d7084935b490c9d1433a65b6bee19.png" alt="image"><br><hr><br><blockquote><h3>  In what format will be corporate and in what numbers? </h3></blockquote><br>  The most popular corporate party format is a restaurant.  Most companies prefer to organize the New Year holiday closest to the date of the holiday. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c08/af5/9d3/c08af59d3432489a90f3af3e0882f3bd.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/04b/050/da9/04b050da9aa44b258bdf330713b53a50.png" alt="image"><br><hr><br><blockquote><h3>  Who organizes the New Year's corporate party? <br>  How did you find out about him? </h3></blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dc7/b4a/8b3/dc7b4a8b34264982823b84086e2801c1.png" alt="image"><br><hr><br><blockquote><h3>  Will there be alcohol on the New Year party?  Will there be top management? </h3></blockquote><br>  In the vast majority of companies, corporate events are held with the participation of senior management and with alcohol. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/423/59c/c3b/42359cc3b6594b1ea5104c693bf14dc0.png" alt="image"><br><hr><br><blockquote><h3>  Are you going to take part in the New Year party party? <br>  How do you treat him as a whole? </h3></blockquote><br>  At least two thirds of IT employees plan to participate in the New Year corporate party.  The overwhelming majority treat him positively. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f98/78d/76d/f9878d76d1a64d0ea7ed35c0e74c7364.png" alt="image"><br><hr><br><blockquote><h3>  Does your company wish employees a Happy New Year? <br>  And whether congratulates customers, partners and suppliers? </h3></blockquote><br>  At least in every fourth company, it is customary to give material gifts to their employees, and in every third - to customers, partners and suppliers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bb5/cc7/280/bb5cc7280e1847eebb42631f9d74d014.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In large companies, it is much more common to give New Year's gifts to their customers.  Therefore, it is not surprising that such an initiative often happens in capitals and large cities, where most of them are large private companies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fda/838/a2f/fda838a2fa284e9f8e12d8e9e90ffb78.png" alt="image"><br><hr><br><blockquote><h3>  Do you install a Christmas tree in the office, <br>  Do you play anonymous Santa Clauses? </h3></blockquote><br>  At least in every second company they put up a New Year tree, at least in every fifth they play anonymous Santa Clauses (Secret Santa in the West). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f49/486/f4a/f49486f4a448492db5b04b90380c436b.png" alt="image"><br><hr><br><blockquote><h3>  Do you congratulate colleagues on the New Year? </h3></blockquote><br>  At least in every fifth company, colleagues give each other New Year's gifts.  More often it is done by IT humanities, and much less often by IT developers, as well as salespeople and marketers.  The latter probably have too many colleagues to give presents to everyone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/168/ea2/5cd/168ea25cd0a349e5b099287edc4fb6ae.png" alt="image"><br><hr><br>  All charts are prepared using the service <a href="http://infogr.am/">infogr.am</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/318488/">https://habr.com/ru/post/318488/</a></p>
