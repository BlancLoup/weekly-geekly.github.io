The most popular portable console in the world (but not in Russia;)), a huge number of games, many of which use additional features of the device in the game process - a touchscreen, a microphone, a camera ... there is also a wifi that allows you to play multiplayer games (including and via the Internet).  The hardware is outdated (Nintendo promises to announce a replacement soon), but cosmetic updates are coming out.  The most popular (and most often commercially available) version is NDS Lite, which is now slowly being replaced by NDSi (NDSi XL).  But occasionally there is also the original NDS. <br>  Differences: <br>  <b>Nintendo DS</b> - the original version. <br>  <b>Nintendo DS Lite</b> - reduced size, added the ability to adjust the backlight level, slightly modified ergonomics. <br>  <b>Nintendo DSi</b> - increased screen size, replacing the GBA slot with an SD card slot, the ability to play AAC files, two cameras with a resolution of 640 * 480 (one outside, the other inside), 133 megahertz processor (against 67 in the previous versions) , 16 megabytes of RAM (there were 4), 256 megabytes SSD (there was no previously), updated wifi (supports WPA / 2). <br>  <b>Nintendo DSi LL / XL</b> - Increasing the diagonal of screens up to 4.2 ", more powerful battery. <br><br>  <b>Price:</b> NDS / NDS Lite BU 3500-4500, new ones still occur around 6000-7000.  DSi BU did not see, the new one costs from 9000, on average - 11000. Games cost 1000-1500. <br>  <b>Prevalence:</b> moderate.  The console is much easier to buy than the games for it. <br>  <b>The main genres of games:</b> different.  Arcade, puzzles, strategies, quests ... <br>  <b>Advantages:</b> interesting gameplay, reasonable price (if you take BU) <br>  <b>Disadvantages:</b> quite expensive games, plus their low prevalence - because you have to buy a specially trained cartridge and pirate games from the Internet.  Although some can and buy ...

Usually when they talk about a portable game console, they mean the PSP.  Excellent screen, powerful hardware, comfortable ergonomics, Wi-Fi, support for memory cards.  Can be used as a reader, browser, media player.  Emulators of old consoles, including the official emulator of the first Playstation. <br>  There are four versions: <br>  <b>PSP 100x</b> - the first models.  Was available infrared. <br>  <b>PSP 200x (Slim)</b> - became a little less, easier.  The infrared port was gone, the RAM was added, the opportunity to connect to the TV appeared. <br>  <b>PSP 300x (Bright)</b> - a microphone has appeared, a new screen is brighter, more anti-reflective. <br>  <b>PSP Go</b> - slider.  Removed miniUSB, removed UMD disk support - you cannot play old licensed games.  16 gigabytes of internal memory, Bluetooth, new memory card format (M2).  The ability (or rather the need) to buy games over the Internet (PSN).  Smaller sizes. <br><br>  <b>Price:</b> Used - around 5000-6000, new - from 8000 to 11000 (for PSP Go) <br>  <b>Prevalence:</b> high, the price on the secondary market is high - that is, it is in demand. <br>  <b>The main game genres:</b> arcade, action, racing ... Although there are fighting games, RPGs, and strategies. <br>  <b>Advantages:</b> high prevalence, powerful hardware, excellent graphics, great functionality <br>  <b>Disadvantages: a</b> rather large size, with the release of PSP Go, the platform has almost completely changed - old games and accessories do not fit it.  Fun with hacked firmware - if you do not want to be limited to licensed games, you will have to carefully watch what you buy. <br><br>  Reviews: <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/games/80136/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/games/80136</a> - PSP Go <br>  According to the previous versions of the reviews, and so the car ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3f6/48e/b19/3f648eb19f1c5c596a4965ef4c548131.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24e/38c/9e2/24e38c9e2a418c35fc184b623ff6b6af.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  Apple Ipod Touch (and Iphone) </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/20d/764/213/20d76421347ed6ef94b5b9a403e70467.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Ipod Touch - initially positioned as a media player, but in the end it turned out something like a PDA.  A fairly large set of software, one of the best mobile browsers, a good screen, a good speed. <br>  There are a lot of games.  Distributed through the online store AppStore.  They are not very expensive (on average - $ 5-10), most games have free demo versions.  Ported many games from other consoles - NDS and PSP, plus there are emulators of some platforms (NES, SNES ...). <br>  Game control - touchscreen (multitouch) plus accelerometer.  It is inconvenient to play part of the games - the ‚Äújoystick‚Äù is drawn on the screen, the fingers are closed during the game.  And on the other hand, on the contrary, there are no problems, even despite the same ‚Äújoystick‚Äù on the screen. <br>  In general, it was a very decent gaming platform.  According to the schedule - better than NDS, but worse than the PSP.  For ease of management - depends on the game.  For example, if you take GTA: Chinatown Wars, which appeared on all three platforms, then I would not say where the more convenient control is on NDS or on ipod.  But the PSP with this game is an obvious outsider. <br><br>  Everything said about ipod also applies to iphone. <br><br>  There are several options for ipod touch and iphone. <br>  <b>Iphone (2G)</b> - original, 4, 8, 16 GB <br>  <b>Iphone 3G</b> - 2G plus support for 3G and GPS, 8 and 16GB <br>  <b>Iphone 3Gs</b> - more powerful CPU, GPU, double the size of RAM.  16 and 32 GB <br><br>  <b>Ipod Touch 1G</b> - the original version.  8, 16, 32 gigabytes. <br>  <b>Ipod Touch 2G</b> - differs from the first generation in the presence of bluetooth, which was activated when updating the IphoneOS 3.0, 8, 16, 32 gigabytes. <br>  <b>IPod Touch 3G</b> - latest version.  8, 32, 64 gigabytes. <br>  Touch 3G 8GB is, in fact, 2G with iphoneOS 3.0 originally installed <br>  Touch 3G 32 and 64 is really a new platform, more memory, a more powerful processor and a "video card" (similar to the iphone 3Gs). <br><br>  So if we consider the device as a game console, then the best choice is Ipod Touch 3G 32GB.  Because there are already games that slow down on less powerful models.  Even seemingly such garbage as Plants and Zombies. <br><br>  <b>Price:</b> <br>  Ipod Touch: Used - 6000-7000, the new one starts from 8500 for 3G 8Gb, 10,000 - 3G 32Gb. <br>  Iphone: <br>  Bootstock of the first generations - approximately 10,000, 3G - from 16,000; <br>  New - 3G somewhere from 20,000, 3Gs - from 30,000 <br>  <b>Prevalence:</b> ipod touch - not very, iphone - high <br>  <b>The main genres of games:</b> puzzles, puzzles, arcades.  But there are strategies and 3D-action ... <br>  <b>Advantages:</b> wow factor - enjoy nicely, a large number of games, low price of games, ease of purchase (all you need is internet access and a bank card) <br>  <b>Disadvantages:</b> two main disadvantages. <br>  The first is that the back side is very easily scratched (if metallic).  For a couple of weeks of wearing without a cover, it seems that it was covered with sandpaper.  It is treated by the purchase of a cover. <br>  The second disadvantage is itunes.  The disadvantage is huge and almost incurable.  Programs and games, of course, can be downloaded via the Internet.  But work with a computer, synchronization, downloading music and video (as well as installing pirated software) - only through itunes.  What is more, the disadvantage is rather ideological, not technical ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3f9/4cb/633/3f94cb6334e279af320d7c585df2d1b7.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/91b/a21/09f/91ba2109f53989dffef5b130d6bdb4cd.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4ac/c12/cd0/4acc12cd037486b1bfb852c858f51d95.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ae7/e85/42a/ae7e8542acf7aa7f6c4e58296ce11c0d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  PDA and communicators for WM </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1c0/51b/09e/1c051b09ebc675f0095a59f5b81f5a3c.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Not the best choice as a gaming platform.  There is a whole bunch of different devices that differ in power and ergonomics, respectively, the games will have to be selected based on the capabilities. <br>  Most often, the CCP plays solitaire and other puzzles, the touchscreen has this. <br>  Step-by-step strategies are also found.  The RTS is worse, but it is also possible if the screen is big enough and the processor is smart. <br>  Arcade - depends on the availability and location of hardware buttons.  On modern devices it is already difficult, and on earlier ones, where there were up to a dozen buttons, it was sometimes quite comfortable to play. <br>  Quests - are.  There are native, you can also play through ScummVM. <br><br>  <b>Price:</b> BU - from about 4-5 thousand, and pretty good models are found (older Looxs, Dell 51, ipaq 4700).  New (already communicators, not PDAs) start from about 10 thousand. <br>  <b>Prevalence:</b> High <br>  <b>Main game genres:</b> see above <br>  <b>Advantages:</b> relatively inexpensive, easy installation of games, multi-functionality. <br>  <b>Disadvantages: a</b> large variety of devices, often the ergonomics of the device does not allow to play a specific game.  And not really they are intended for games ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1d2/0b3/443/1d20b3443e4012f77075ba05324d59a5.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/46c/8a9/9cd/46c8a99cd5d885860f39a05cc017fa65.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bde/8ec/ac0/bde8ecac07669490428b0a6d1528f55d.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d16/6e0/f32/d166e0f32403befbd8d23c4a2f399f8d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><hr><br>  In the end ... And in the end? <br>  Aside, there were an android and symbian, as well as phones with java-games.  I did not consider them, because I will not write anything.  But, I think, there is something in the WM area - it strongly depends on the device itself and only secondarily - on the platform. <br><br>  Personally, I have the following devices: <br>  <b>HTC Max 4G</b> .  Always with you.  Played games are Bejeweled 2 and Atomic Canon (a relative of Scorched Earth). <br>  <b>Nintendo DS</b> .  Most of the time he lives at home, but he goes on vacation and business trips with me.  Games - Scribblenauts, Castlevania (arcade), Professor Layton (a collection of puzzles with a plot), GTA Chinatown Wars, Tetris DS, MarioCarts. <br>  <b>Ipod Touch</b> 3G 8GB (I mean, in fact, the second generation).  A gift that I can not sell.  :) He lives at home, the main tasks - the Internet on the couch, when it is lazy to get a laptop, Plants and Zombies, GTA Chinatown Wars, Labirynth2. <br><br>  But the absolute champion in playing time is Bejeweled 2. :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e26/75e/717/e2675e717c48924b810f2b453cdd0d46.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c2c/1f1/fbd/c2c1f1fbdb8a797c67b475be124b0755.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/83286/">https://habr.com/ru/post/83286/</a></p>
