Nevertheless, there are no good reviews either on Habr√© or in RuNet - but in vain, because this mouse is considered one of the best in its price range. <br>  Like many Steelseries devices, the mouse comes in different versions - there are options with a laser and optical sensor, as well as with surfaces of different types and colors. <br>  I got a white mouse with a laser sensor - Ikari Laser White, released in the 2009th year. <br>  And so, let's go! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><br><br><h1>  Packaging </h1><br>  Packaging, in principle, is no different from most mice from Steelseries. <br>  The device itself, which is under the plastic form, can be ‚Äúpartially‚Äù taken in the hand without removing it from the package.  It allows you to make a kind of cutout in the bottom of the box.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/a629954e/4460a813/7e55fd3d/1537abf6.jpg"><br><br>  Of the interesting things on the package there are awards from various publications. <br>  Their list is located on the right side of the box. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/69e4fe88/df65d1a7/cd7cc832/fbbade76.jpg"><br><br>  It's time to open the box! <br>  In addition to the mouse itself, the box has a compartment for the wire located to the left of the device, as well as a sealed package with ‚Äúbonuses‚Äù located under the mouse itself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/ea478474/ef53822d/61dbd2bd/a9fc2982.jpg"><br><br>  We get everything inside: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/ab10bf53/8b37a62f/427541a1/9e50678a.jpg"><br><br>  In the bag you can find a fairly standard set of items: <br>  - 14-page mouse instructions <br>  - Brochure - a short catalog of Steelseries products <br>  - Disk with the program to configure (drivers for Ikari, as well as for most gaming mice, is not required, but more on that later). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/037c813c/33169ec1/c3306041/3b97631b.jpg"><br><br><h1>  Appearance </h1><br>  And so, let's move on to the mouse itself.  It has a rather unusual shape ‚Äî most resembling the Logitech mouse line. <br>  At first glance it seems that the mouse is designed under the left hand - this impression is created thanks to the extended right and recessed left button, as well as a strong ‚Äútilt‚Äù to the right.  Nevertheless, from the first minutes of work, it becomes clear that the mouse is ideally suited to the contrary for right-handed people (but with my left hand I didn‚Äôt even get it). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/ad94430b/4ffe72d5/277805cd/312b9fd2.jpg"><br><br>  The surface of the mouse consists of two parts - rubberized black plastic on the sides and white glossy plastic on top. <br>  At the bottom is the steelseries logo. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/6fd43745/3c4ebd41/318d8a21/a3c5e2ba.jpg"><br><h1>  Ergonomics </h1><br>  Ergonomics is probably one of the most interesting features of this mouse.  As I wrote above, the mouse is ideal for right-handers. <br>  Personally, Ikari perfectly fit into my hand, but as you know, there are different types of grip.  Basically they are divided into two types: <br>  1) ‚Äúfull palm‚Äù grip <br>  2) ‚Äúfingers only‚Äù grip. <br>  I used to put the whole hand on the mouse and pinch it with my thumb and ring finger.  But, honestly, I can not imagine how this mouse will be held by a person with a grip of the second type. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/2a3fa2aa/13087e74/10a5114e/9f7c455c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/0ba98a39/4374c79c/927edb95/fd84140b.jpg"><br><br><h1>  Device and technical characteristics </h1>  <b>Size and weight:</b> <br>  It is long - 130mm <br>  Width - 83mm <br>  Height - 36mm <br>  Weight - 98 grams <br>  Wire length - 2 meters <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/da8d8416/f0d2741f/3851d731/9cb9513a.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Sensor:</b> <br>  Sample per second: 40,000 SPS <br>  Inch per second: 50 <br>  Readings per inch: 1 - 3.200 CPI <br>  Maximum acceleration: 20 G <br>  Maximum height from sensor to surface: ~ 1.8 mm <br>  Maximum polling frequency: 1.000 Hz <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/89aac821/ab15a0db/3a74b528/0439f4dc.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Buttons and indicators:</b> <br>  In addition to the standard buttons and the scroll wheel, Ikari has two side buttons to which any macro can be assigned, as well as a toggle button and a CPI indicator.  The latter can be used to switch CPI ‚Äúon the fly‚Äù between two values ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äî low and high.  By default, Ikari is set to 800 low and 3200 high CPI. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/adc0ec6c/4f95c208/b0a06961/896699ad.jpg"><br><br>  In addition, Ikari has a LCD-display, located at the bottom, at the base of the mouse.  It shows your current profile, and also allows you to change the low and hight CPI settings ‚Äúon the fly‚Äù (see below). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/e2dbd5ff/1c9f6e22/eb8e6624/9a7d34e7.jpg"><br><br><h1>  Customization </h1>  Like any professional gaming mouse, Ikari does not need third-party drivers, and works on the principle of Plug-and-play. <br>  However, for proper setup, you still need a utility.  All settings are saved in the internal memory of the mouse, so the utility is enough to put once on one computer.  You can install the utility from the disk that comes with the mouse, or you can download it from the official website <a href="http://www.steelseries.com/">www.steelseries.com</a> . <br><br>  <b>Profile Setup</b> <br>  Ikari supports saving profiles directly to the mouse.  In addition, you can safely import / export them.  Your current profile is always displayed on the LCD under the base of the mouse. <br>  Each profile contains key settings (including macros), sensor sensitivity settings, and freemove on / off. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/c5338ec9/ab2a6038/4d1f7314/73843aa6.jpg"><br><br>  You can write macros for each key (including non-standard), for this purpose there is a built-in macro editor in the settings utility: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/980fb0e6/eb631f43/1422bde5/1616e16c.jpg"><br><br>  Also in the profile you can customize high CPI and low CPI.  Switching between them is done using the CPI switch button, which is located under the scroll wheel. <br>  After you set the low CPI and high CPI settings, you can change the CPI manually using the LCD display.  To do this, press and hold the CPI switch button for a few seconds.  After that, ‚ÄúDPI SET:‚Äù appears on the display, and you can change this value using the wheel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/16dd4fbd/daa45441/23e6025f/947eac97.jpg"><br><br>  The last thing you can find in the profile settings is the FreeMove option.  A similar option is present in most gaming mice, and is called (for example) ‚Äúdrift control‚Äù.  By default, it is disabled - and I do not advise to turn it on.  The fact that this option is trying to align the line of movement of the cursor.  I do not know, maybe this is useful when working, but when playing first-person shooters, you, as a player, first of all need accuracy and full control of the sight, not a straight line of motion. <br>  However, if you want to turn it on, you can always do this with two taps. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/ee8940e9/a63df190/df868a18/15738776.jpg"><br><br><br><h1>  Let's sum up </h1><br>  Despite the lack of attention paid to this device, Ikari is 100% professional.  To find fault with something is quite difficult.  The only significant reason why you can not buy this mouse is a specific form, suitable only for one type of grip (unlike, for example, from Xai / Kinzu, which are suitable for any grip). <br><br>  <b>And so, let's summarize all the pros and cons:</b> <br><br>  <font color="green"><b>+</b></font> Beautiful design <br>  <font color="green"><b>+</b></font> Excellent ergonomics <br>  <font color="green"><b>+</b></font> Ability to change CPI to any value on the fly <br>  <font color="green"><b>+</b></font> Good optical sensor <br>  <font color="green"><b>+</b></font> Built-in Macro Editor <br>  <font color="green"><b>+</b></font> Very low price for a device of this class - ‚Ç¨ 69.99 <br><br>  <font color="red"><b>- The</b></font> mouse does not fit all types of grip <br>  <font color="red"><b>- The</b></font> glossy surface on top of Ikari Laser White gets dirty (other versions of the mouse have this problem) <br><br>  If you are looking for a gaming mouse in the middle price range, and you are sure that a large device will suit you like a grip - you definitely need to buy Steelseries Ikari.  But if you have a small hand, or you are just used to holding the mouse with your fingers, it is unlikely that it will work for you, but ultimately you can take the same Kinzu. <br><br>  And finally, my personal assessment of Ikari: <br><br>  Design: ....................
