    <a name="habracut"></a><h4>  Health insurance </h4><br><br>  At present, the capabilities of the supercomputer are used by WellPoint, Inc.  This is an American company (135 in the Fortune Global 500 list) that provides health insurance services. <br><br>  The company cooperates with approximately 600 thousand professionals working with medical data of clients.  About 80-90% of such data is unstructured information.  People are not always able to correctly process such data arrays, identify dependencies, and propose an optimal solution. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/e5-Ji492pPI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500003,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhj6z0PuQvIsR9XURKgamsNDB5afXg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  With the help of IBM Watson, a supercomputer whose capabilities are optimized for working with Big Data, all this data is processed quickly, identifying the necessary connections and further structuring information. <br><br>  As a result, WellPoint, Inc.  improves the quality and effectiveness of their own medical decisions. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/sIxOM2Y5yuE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500003,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgyhKsnQ3P8Ur87pJ3R5TFAo3m6Ig" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  Financial Markets (US and Mexico) </h4><br><br>  Modern financial sphere is a very difficult subject to study.  Every day only about 6 thousand articles and news about finance are published on the WSJ (Wall Street Journal).  To keep track of such a flow of information for one person or even the company's average arm is almost impossible. <br><br>  But in order to understand where the financial market is moving, you need to process all this data. <br><br>  <b>DBS Bank</b> decided to test the capabilities of IBM Watson to optimize its work.  Measures taken by regulators, social and government changes, fluctuations of financial markets - now all this is taken into account in the work of the bank. <br><br>  In addition, Watson Engagement Advisor, a consultant from IBM Watson, is used to optimize the work of bank managers and customers.  A personalized approach in the banking sector is no less in demand than in the medical field. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/rxxNP0SZ6LU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500003,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhh-qNr-idfBAUejatNtxPNhQ3RVQw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Banorte</b> creates personalized banking services with Big Data. <br><br>  When Banorte had fewer branches, they knew every customer by sight, and the bank became one of the largest in Mexico.  But as it grew, there was less and less opportunity to understand the needs of each particular client. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.ibm.com/big-data/us/en/big-data-and-analytics/marketing.html">IBM solutions</a> ( <a href="http://www.ibm.com/big-data/us/en/big-data-and-analytics/marketing.html">IBM solutions</a> ) for working with Big Data and analytics tools helped Banorte employees to get an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe behavior of specific bank customers.  Now the bank is reorganizing its systems, and its employees can get access to information about which offers are of most interest to a particular customer.  This creates a personalized approach to the provision of services. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/zNYnM7pGwPk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500003,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjzB4IG_AZKBP-0oZ-c-bVg36jZmw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  As a result, the efficiency of the company increased by 50%.  In addition, + 20% return on equity is expected thanks to a new customer-oriented banking model. <br><br><h4>  Company / corporation research </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/747/1b6/efd/7471b6efd65a2569d89709709aa0812c.jpg"><br><br>  According to The Economist, in 2012 alone, companies spent $ 603 billion to conduct various studies.  The IBM Watson Discovery Advisor is now helping some companies analyze the results of such research, collect and process data, synthesize new solutions based on old solutions and new research results. <br><br>  Here is an <a href="http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/introducing-watson-discovery-advisor.html">interesting infographic</a> with an example of the work of the IBM Watson Discovery Advisor. <br><br><h4>  State and society </h4><br><br>  Now the first attempts of IBM Watson in the sphere of interaction between the state and citizens are underway.  It‚Äôs too early to talk about results, but the potential for using Watson‚Äôs opportunities in this sector is quite large. <br><br>  For example, for citizens, IBM Watson can give advice on the use of their own finances (where to invest, where to save and everything else). <br><br>  For officials, IBM Watson can provide job tips to help you make the best decisions.  What is the best way to use road repair tools?  What company to hire for repair?  What district of the city needs more funds for landscaping?  All this can be calculated and analyzed. <br><br>  And for public safety, IBM Watson can also be useful in helping to highlight key areas of work for analysts and researchers working in this field. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/226611/">https://habr.com/ru/post/226611/</a></p>
