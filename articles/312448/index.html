  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Personal experience of implementing the GLPI system. Part 1</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, I was entrusted with the task of resuscitation of a system of service desk systems based on the already deployed GLPI.  About the deployment of the system itself will not write, the benefit of this information in the network is complete.  The reasons for implementation are also, as it seems to me clear (they are all the same).  I was faced with the fact that I could not find a single normal article directly on the commissioning of this system.  Actually, this will be about this post. <br><br>  The first part of the post will be theoretical - about preparing for commissioning, the second part about setting up the system. <br><br><h3>  1. Analysis of the current activities of the department </h3><br>  <b>A few words about the company:</b> <br>  The main direction - construction, permanent staff&gt; 150 people,&gt; 5 remote sites. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>About the department itself:</b> <br>  The department employs 6 people:

    <ul><li>  1C programmer - decides on the introduction of useful software for the needs of the company; </li><li>  Technical support specialist - your humble servant, the main direction - user support, secondary - development of department documentation, etc .; </li><li>  Network Administrator - administration of company servers, telephony, etc .; </li><li>  Web developer - responsible for the company's website; </li><li>  Infrastructure specialist - internal company infrastructure; </li><li>  IT service manager. </li></ul><br>  <b>Conclusion:</b> <br>  As a result of acquaintance with the duties of the staff, four main directions for setting up and using the system were derived: <br><br><ul><li>  Support - this includes change requests, incidents, critical incidents.  The deadline for this type of calls is set according to the services catalog (see below); </li><li>  Maintenance - making changes to the used systems, resources, equipment settings.  The deadline is set by the specialist responsible for the decision of the application; </li><li>  Projects (separate GLPI module) - work on new projects.  Specified criteria for defining a project: there is a start time and an end time, there are clear objectives (project milestones), there is a group of participants, there is a goal.  The deadline is set by the project team; </li><li>  Tasks of the head of the department to their employees. </li></ul><br>  It was also decided to provide multi-level support.  Initially, the question of single-level support was considered, but in this case, the appeals were duplicated. <br><br><h3>  2. Preparation for the internal configuration of the GLPI system (theory, documentation) </h3><br>  The first stage of system commissioning is a description of the theoretical part of the system operation and operation with the system.  I will not prevaricate, many things have been documented already in the process of setting up the system (precisely because of the lack of a tutorial on this system). <br><br>  <b>Services Catalog:</b> <br>  In the best traditions of itil, it was decided to compile a catalog of the company's services and describe the services provided.  After that, register the metrics, SLA for applications responsible for solving problems.  The service catalog has the following structure: <br><br><ul><li>  Tab "Service" - the name of the service, for example, mail, 1C, telephony, etc .; </li><li>  ‚ÄúServices‚Äù tab - services provided within the service, for example, setting up an account, providing access, etc .; </li><li>  Tab "Users" - a description of user groups using the service, for example, top management, administration, office, etc .; </li><li>  Tab "Accessibility" - a description of the level of availability of the service, for example, 24x7, 5x40, etc .; </li><li>  Tab "Impact" - a description of the level of criticality of the service, the impact on other services, the impact on the business processes of the company; </li><li>  Tab "Responsible" - responsible for the provision of services specialists; </li><li>  The ‚ÄúMetrics‚Äù tab - description of measurable metrics, for example, response time to a call, the maximum time to solve a call, the permissible number of hits at a specific time, etc. </li></ul><br>  <b>Types of applications:</b> <br>  Next was the process of dividing applications / calls into types: <br><br><ul><li>  Request - all requests for changing something, for example, granting / changing access rights, installing software, etc., resolving such requests in 5x40 mode; </li><li>  Incident - temporary suspension of access or operation of the service for 1-3 people at a time, the decision of such requests in the 5x40 mode; </li><li>  A critical incident is the unavailability of the service for 4 or more people at a time, the resolution of such requests occurs 24x7. </li></ul><br>  <b>Groups:</b> <br>  Division of the department into groups (with a reserve for state expansion) and the appointment of responsible: <br>  Since it was decided to use a multi-level support model with a different direction of work and interaction with the glpi system, several groups were identified: <br><br><ul><li>  Infrastructure - here are included: network infrastructure, development of standards, support for gateways, support for network equipment.  Responsible - network administrator; </li><li>  Telephony - PBX service, subscriber administration, connections to the call center.  Responsible network administrator; </li><li>  Users and user equipment - installation and support of workplaces, connection of peripherals, repair of equipment, replacement of consumables, etc are collected here; </li><li>  Server infrastructure - responsible infrastructure specialist; </li><li>  Web resources - creation, support and maintenance.  Responsible web developer; </li><li>  Corporate information systems.  Development and releases, administration of user rights, work with contractors.  Responsible - 1C developer. </li><li>  Third-party IT services.  Mobile communications, efficiency, the Internet - this is what is on the outsource. </li></ul><br>  This division allowed to delineate the areas of responsibility and to remove from the agenda the question - why employees are controlled by their colleague. <br><br>  <b>SLA:</b> <br>  Then came the time to work out the SLA (deadline for calls).  Below I list the factors that influenced the installation of SLA specifically in our case. <br><br><ul><li>  The location of the customer.  Some issues require going to the customer to the site, respectively, the deadline for such calls was set taking into account travel time + 20% of the time from the usual SLA; </li><li>  Criticalness / influence - SLA for appeals that have a noticeable impact on the company's business processes was established the minimum possible term of the decision (within a reasonable one); </li><li>  Responsibility for the service.  Here it is meant whose service is not available - ours or provider.  If the service is not available from the provider, for example, the Internet, the SLA was taken from the service agreement. </li></ul><br>  These three indicators changed the SLA up or down.  Of course, the SLA in each company will be its own, here I just indicated the positions that, in my opinion, should be paid attention to. <br><br>  After working through this theoretical part, I proceeded to the internal configuration of the system.  About this in the second part. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/312448/">https://habr.com/ru/post/312448/</a></p>
