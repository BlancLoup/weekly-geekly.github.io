  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Telecom Veteran</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Usually, the history of Asian companies begins with the inventions of rice cookers and electric frying pans, but Fujitsu has always worked in the field of IT and telecom, although next year it will mark a solid jubilee - 90 years. <a name="habracut"></a>  The Japanese spirit was incorporated into it from the very beginning - its first activity was the restoration of the telephone infrastructure in Tokyo and Yokohama.  It was decided to replace all PBXs with automatic ones, on which subscribers were connected by a relay, and not a human operator.  To do this, Furukawa Electric and Siemens formed Fuji Electric, from the communications division of which Fujitsu Technology Solutions was subsequently formed.  Although at first the contribution of the Japanese side was limited to the creation of electric motors and generators, the well-known ‚ÄúJapanese miracle‚Äù helped Fujitsu to ascend to the top of the world IT Olympus. <br><br>  Fujitsu is now playing a leading role in the information and communication technology (ICT) market, offering a full range of technology products, solutions and services.  It employs over 170,000 employees, serving customers in more than 100 countries around the world, and Fujitsu Limited‚Äôs revenue for the last fiscal year was $ 55 billion.  As you understand, the modern ICT market is based on computer technologies and Fujitsu made its first step towards them in 1954 when it created the first computer in Japan - FACOM 100. The history of this device shows that the Japanese, who are famous for their devotion to traditions, are able to show flexibility in the right moments.  At that time, the telecommunications company did not need a computer, it was created at the insistence of young engineers who were eager to explore the possibilities of a new type of device that was gaining popularity in the world.  Scientists themselves have abandoned vacuum tubes.  No matter how interesting the new technology looked, they were not reliable enough, and as a result, Fujitsu created the first FACOM 100 computer in Japan on the relay - that‚Äôs the telecommunications legacy. <br><br>  In the future, the company successfully mastered both lamp and transistor technologies, on which branded communication systems and computing systems were created.  By 1995, the light proprietary processor Fujitsu SPARC64, which allowed the company to create servers and supercomputers, repeatedly became record breakers in performance.  With the development of cloud technologies, Fujitsu has proposed a solution for managing petaflop data volumes.  In addition, the company now monitors compliance with environmental technologies, including creating large data centers on the basis of its solutions, which are effective due to the simultaneous service of a large number of people - it is more profitable to serve users in bulk both for the owner and for nature, which means ultimately for each of us.
