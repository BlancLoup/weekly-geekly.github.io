  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Divorce from mobile scam</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I decided to tell the habrasoobshchestvo a case that happened to me today. <br><br>  <b>Background:</b> <br>  My friend received a voice message from the number 9121577124 that he won a prize from Russian Radio.  I specifically publish the issue, because I am 100% sure that this is a divorce.  In view of the fact that he did not have the opportunity to call this number - he instructed me to do this.  Since the number of a friend does not belong to me (logical, yes?) And there is a suspicion that the specified phone number in the message, supposedly Russian Radio, is paid - it was decided to make a call via Skype. <br><br>  MXSkypeRecorder helped me with this.  Immediately I apologize for the sound quality, for the format of its presentation (I did not understand how to make a small player).  Part of the conversation was lost due to the trial version of the program, I will describe this part separately.  Also this wonderful program in the second part of our dialogue changed my voice timbre.  Well, I'm not offended.  Maybe I also have a problem with diction - I can't do anything about it.  Further 2 files with records and text.

      <b>Part 1:</b> <br>  What alarmed from the first minute of the call was the abundant use of <b>"that is,"</b> which infected me, the words <b>"cho"</b> and the fact that the operator did not introduce himself.  The operator immediately gave me 500 words that the company was conducting a rally from Russian Radio and my number was on the list of the lucky ones, listed all known sponsors (DHL, Samsung).  Typical layout.  All that the victim as quickly as possible began to trust fraudsters. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The conversation was interrupted (and for the better, the sound recording was turned off).  I call back, no answer.  I'm stubborn.  I call back again, pleasant music sounds, my clicks are heard in the background (at this time surfing something). <br><br>  Then I made the first mistake that should have alerted the operator.  I, having introduced myself as Andrey, said that the SMS had come, but the voice message was actually received.  But, apparently, you want money, and you can close your eyes to something.  The phone number and all my addresses I zapikal jackpot sounds from slot machines.  30 seconds of agonizing waiting for verification on the basis of my phone and here it is happiness: they told me that I won a computer based on an <b>Intel Pentium processor from Samsung</b> (ding!). <br><br>  DHL - courier delivery, Eurotelecom is a sponsor, Samsung is a computer.  Turn on the fool.  We want to take the prize. <br><br>  <b>(3.22 Mb)</b> <a href="http://ifolder.ru/17259682">Mirror 1</a> <br><video>  http://rutube.ru/tracks/3133233.html?v=7d7457402e977d6669ad8de5c91b1a18 </video><br><br>  I was offered 2 options.  You can pick up the prize, arriving at the office at the address indicated or pick up the money quotation: <b>equivalent</b> .  What would happen if you come to the office is not clear.  I decided to take the money.  112,000 is still a lot of money, and I have a computer.  I was told that I can give my details, which they will send to the bank and quote: <b>‚Äútheirs‚Äù</b> employees will tell me what to do. <br><br>  This is where the first part is interrupted.  What was between 1 and 2 - I tell below: <br><br>  <b>Part 1.5.</b>  <b>Lost sound:</b> <br>  The operator representing the company Russian Radio suddenly began to represent the company Eurotelecom.  The second miss operator.  He said that their instant payment terminals are located throughout the Russian Federation.  And the only condition for receiving my 112 thousand rubles of blood is a small money transfer.  That is - the main point of making a profit by fraudsters. <br><br>  <b>Part 2. Money transfer:</b> <br>  I was offered to replenish the balance of my phone bill through their terminal.  The amount that I needed to transfer - 3000 rubles.  I do not know how they will receive their money, but it seems to me that this is a commission for using the terminal of instant payment. <br><br>  The operator tearfully asked to keep the check and in no case throw out.  He, they say, I will bring to pick up their won money.  A check is a legal document, blah blah blah.  The operator has a southern accent.  The check is presented to the cashier who will serve us, we give our information, passport data, we get a cash equivalent. <br><br>  We clarify information so that nothing is lost, we clarify how I nevertheless became lucky.  Turn on the fool again.  Of the 200 numbers - I am the only one, a computer well done, I divided the numbers into 10 prize rooms and I won. <br><br>  <b>(3.19Mb)</b> <a href="http://ifolder.ru/17259705">Mirror 2</a> <br><video>  http://rutube.ru/tracks/3133374.html?v=2b00b7120ac53c1d089ad53331692e65 </video><br><br>  3 operator error: you need to urgently transfer money, right within an hour.  If I do not have time - he will not provide information to the general sponsors (although the general sponsor was presented by Eurotelecom itself).  They work up to 17 hours.  The name of the operator Mikhail Kiselev. <br><br>  We said goodbye to the operator, he promised to call back.  Sorry, but I could not resist after the word: <b>"Pazdravlyyayem</b> . <b>"</b> <br><br>  4 operator error.  Data mismatch.  During the hour, a call is received from the same number on the friend‚Äôs number: <br><br>  A: Hello again.  So we talked with you, do you agree with our terms? <br>  D: Hello.  Specify again?  ( <i>since I was talking on the phone, and a friend only gave me a number</i> - he doesn‚Äôt know anything about it, but I didn‚Äôt have time to tell. But he didn‚Äôt lose his head and the conversation continued). <br>  O, sure.  Lots of text.  You need to come and replenish the balance.  All things. <br>  D: Please tell me the address of your office? <br>  About: st.  Academician Queen 11. <br>  - <i>on the map - a private house, the address does not coincide with the one mentioned in the first part of the investigation.</i> <br>  D: What is your name? <br>  About: Mikhail Kiselyov. <br>  D: Tell me the address of your site. <br>  A: I can not give you this information. <br>  D: In case of any disputable issues, can we call the ‚ÄúK‚Äù department? <br>  About: Aaaa, ooo, eeee.  Peak-to-peak-to-peak. <br><br>  Moral of this fable.  Do not call the numbers from your mobile - elementary may be charged.  And always check the information from reliable sources (Russian Radio or any other). <br><br>  Remember, fraudsters call from 9121577124.  Thanks for attention. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> Yes, my friend is habrechelok <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/arsenichev/" class="user_link">Arsenichev</a> <br>  <b>UPD 2:</b> The phone number from which they called back the second time - 912 941 24 97. Do not call there either.  Belong to the Republic of Komi.  <a href="">Link</a> <br><br><blockquote>  Dear Subscribers.  SMS messages from fraudsters from numbers +79041 ****** can come to your mobile numbers <br><br>  (operator Parma-Mobile, Komi Republic), or from MTS numbers in the Moscow region that you allegedly won various valuable prizes, and with a request to call back to the number you determined, to clarify the details.  Fraudsters, as an option, can be represented by Evrotelecom CJSC branch in various cities.  After a long-distance call, you will be asked to pay money in one way or another, under various pretexts.  We urge you to be vigilant and do not buy into the tricks of fraudsters. <br><br>  Yours faithfully, Administration of CJSC "Eurotelecom" <br></blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/90733/">https://habr.com/ru/post/90733/</a></p>
