  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"Ru-Center" did not recognize the sale of "Sotovik"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For the second time in recent times, Sotovik Information Analytical Agency (Sotovik IAA) has lost control over the popular <a href="http://www.sotovik.ru/">mobile portal of the</a> same name.  The management of the domain sotovik.ru was carried out by the agency under a contract with the owner of the domain - the company ‚ÄúYusar‚Äù.  However, on Tuesday, October 31, Karina managed to get the daughter of the owner of 75% of the share of Yusar Larisa Novikova to receive in the Tax Inspectorate No. 46 of Moscow the fact that she is the general director of the company. <br><br>  The tax certificate Ms. Novikova submitted to the registrar of the domain sotovik.ru - <a href="http://www.nic.ru/">‚ÄúRu-Center‚Äù</a> , after which she was given passwords from the management of the domain.  Then there was a change in the ns servers, which Sotovik had its own, on the ns server hosting provider <a href="http://www.masterhost.ru/">Masterhost</a> .  Now the address sotovik.ru leads to the site controlled by Ms. Novikova and completely duplicating the content of the former ‚ÄúSotovik‚Äù (the differences between the two ‚ÄúSotovikov‚Äù are not even noticeable). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The CEO of the Sotovik IAA, Viktor Strizhak, who until recently was also the CEO of Yusara, did not agree with the election of Ms Novikova to his position.  Support for Strizhak is provided by the wife of his brother and the owner of a 25% share of Yusara Ekaterina Arkova.  ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt understand what Novikov‚Äú invented ‚Äùthis time in order to take possession of the domain,‚Äù says Mr. Strizhak‚Äôs lawyer Vyacheslav Chekhovskaya.  - Once <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/article/1294/">she managed to convince the tax inspectorate</a> that she was allegedly the general director of Yusara.  However, at that time an independent examination recognized the documents submitted by it as falsified. " <br><br>  ‚ÄúAs a result, a criminal case was initiated into the forgery, and Mr. Stryzhak was returned to the director‚Äôs office,‚Äù continues the lawyer.  ‚ÄúIt is possible that this time it will all end in a new criminal case.‚Äù  According to the Yusara statute, the election of the general director requires the support of all 100% of the company's members, Mr. Chekhovskaya argues, and therefore all meetings held by Novikova to elect her are illegal and appealed to the Moscow Arbitration Court.

      The struggle for "Yusar" can lead to the loss of its assets by the company.  So, back in July, Yusar, headed by Strizhak, sold the domain sotovik.ru to a certain citizen Istomin, who, however, has not yet been able to become its owner.  ‚ÄúAgain, it‚Äôs not clear how Novikova convinced the Ru-Center not to transfer Istomin‚Äôs domain rights,‚Äù Mr. Chekhovskaya says.  - In this regard, Istomin sued ‚ÄúYusar‚Äù, and we - to the ‚ÄúRu-Center‚Äù.  Moreover, since the registrar had thus violated his own rules, we filed a complaint about his actions with the Federal Service for Supervision in the Field of Communications ‚Äù. <br><br>  Karina Novikova herself calls the return of legal rights the incident, while the sale of the domain to Istomin calls it, on the contrary, as an illegal attempt to withdraw assets.  ‚ÄúI am the legitimate general director of Yusara, because I represent the interests of my mother and the owner of a 75% stake in the company,‚Äù Ms Novikova told Habrahabru.  - According to the new charter of Yusara, the decision on the appointment of the general director is taken by 2/3 of the votes.  This means that Mr. Strizhak is no longer ‚Äúnobody‚Äù in our company, and he has no rights.  And Ms. Arkova, as the owner of a minority stake, has nothing to do but agree with my decisions. ‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4652/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4652/</a></p>
