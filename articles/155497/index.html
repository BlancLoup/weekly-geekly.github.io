  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Virus Formula or fortune?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Have you ever thought about why some viral videos fly around the Internet in a couple of days, gaining millions of likes, and others, compiled by the same rules, at first glance, very similar to the model, do not even differ on friends?  The second case is mostly known to those who tried to sit on the tail of the self-organizing power of social communities. <br>  In this article, I will analyze successful and not very viral advertisements from a start-up point of view and offer my version of a viral tool for load testing a video chat platform. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6f4/503/692/6f45036928eb65fc97014a33976719d3.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a>  For starters, what is <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D1%2583%25D1%2581%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B3">virality</a> ? <br>  In Marketing, advertising is called viral if its speed of propagation assumes the character of a geometric progression.  In terms of effect, virality is determined only by the rate of spread.  In this vein, the saying is appropriate: "The news diverges like a shameful disease in a harem." <br>  In theory, everything is clear and obvious, as long as you don‚Äôt bother yourself :-) <br>  The speed can be measured after the launch of the project, if the purpose is to create such an advertisement, then the question arises: ‚ÄúHow?‚Äù. <br>  What needs to be done so that people themselves pass this information to each other?  Indeed, in modern society, the brain uses increasingly sophisticated contraceptives from addictive advertising.  Did you catch yourself thinking that you specifically look away from the running line on the street?  Or do you really try not to read the leaflet that you took from a pretty girl near the subway and quickly squeeze it, throw it into the urn or hole in the post? <br>  I caught myself turning over a cup stand with the inscription in red letters ‚ÄúComus‚Äù, because I get the impression that some trademark is zombies, trying to crawl into my head without permission. <br>  On the other hand, on the same table there is a card on which it says ‚ÄúMorning begins with good coffee.‚Äù  I could have removed it a long time ago, but the effect is the opposite ‚Äî it elevates one‚Äôs mood without causing any phobias.  If you turn it over and look at the small letters, it becomes clear whose work it is.  Emotions are polarly different. <br>  Therefore, our task is to endow the message with disarming kindness and trust.  So that people do not think to put on contraceptives when they award each other, friend, friend, friend with this our ‚Äújoy‚Äù. <br><br><h5>  Market analysis </h5><br>  For a better understanding of the process, I propose to consider the successful implementation of viral projects: <br>  1. I consider the advertising of cheap Centro Czechs to be an unconditional masterpiece, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D1wk1eJH12wI">where a nice girl poses close to the hood of a spying car</a> <br>  2. Button <a href="http://button.dekel.ru/">Make it all good</a> .  Rare project manager did not indulge in her, choosing between suicide, dismissal and taking a triple dose of <a href="">amphetamine</a> <br>  3. <a href="http://youtu.be/N0SvvtNr3Tc">LG TVs</a> - very pleased with the creators <br>  4. On the verge of a masterpiece, I consider advertising the film The <a href="http://youtu.be/T0ZFKcsXZ48">Stone</a> with the Fair Svetlakov.  So that there is no doubt that this is a fake, <a href="http://youtu.be/AT-rTvftC0Q">here's a record of another take</a> <br><br>  From unsuccessful examples I can cite <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/%2BOlegTinkov/posts">Oleg Tinkov</a> , who even tried to post something revolutionary in Habr√©, but quickly realized that with a habpublic it was necessary to be able to play such games, and the post was closed.  As I understood it, it happened because of the wave of critical reviews.  Correct me if someone participated in the discussion and knows more.  The average rate of likes of his advertising is 20-25, but the nature of their presentation clearly claims virality. <br><h5>  What are the reasons? </h5>  Why in one case, advertising shoots like an angry bird in a pig, and in the other gets stuck on your personal page with a dozen likes?  What qualities should have advertising for an exponential set of views? <br>  Here is my version, which can be scattered in the comments: <br>  1. Non-affiliation - advertising should look like information taken and uploaded to a network by a person who does not want to sell you anything <br>  2. Emotionality - the tool should throw in joy or anger or fear, in general, something very strong <br>  3. Sensation - this quality is rare, and it is difficult to suck it out of a finger.  And since sensations are not predicted, I propose to exclude this element from the production chain. <br>  4. Integrating a targeted message is, in my opinion, the most difficult, because you need to strike a balance between the complexity of brand awareness and obsession.  For example, if the identification of a brand is made unobvious, then a wave of emotions will simply pass by your power plant, making a lot of useless splashes.  As an example of such a move, I consider a QR code hanging on all billboards, which was almost impossible to read on the auto, and the percentage of people reading QR was much lower than the potential 4G users who advertised this way.  I learned that this is a megaphone only because I myself was preparing a strategy for bringing to the federal market an unknown service that could change the life of everyone (coarsely embedded :-)). <br>  This is how the megaphone ad looked.  Tens of millions of rubles in the advertising budget in the pipe? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/df3/45e/039/df345e039f7bf5d5a26869ed5afbadf0.jpg"><br>  The opposite side of the medal can be considered the film "Night Watch" part one.  Let me remind you that there Gosha Kutsenko says advertising slogans, the battle is fought on the MTS logo and so on.  This caused a negative reaction, and not the fact that the best impact on sales.  If I am not mistaken, the <a href="http://www.fas.gov.ru/">FAS</a> turned to the filmmakers with complaints. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a90/f7c/e2c/a90f7ce2c3fa27d2274559e7c35cdbed.png">

      <b>Viral instrument</b> <br>  In order not to turn into philosophers, and not to make judgments only on the basis of theory, we decided to launch our first potentially viral mechanism.  This thought led to the attendance of <a href="http://digitaloctober.ru/events/dzheff_hau_sila_kollektivnogo_razuma/video">Jeff Howe's lecture - Crowdsourcing - in Digital October</a> .  Jeff told in a very interesting way how, like Mendeleev, it dawned on him and he came up with this word and became world famous.  Nothing was said about how to use crowdsourcing, how to manage and where to look.  But the idea of ‚Äã‚Äã"with the world on the thread, I Mercedes" beckoned. <br>  The moment came when we needed a load test for video communication servers.  It is necessary to determine the limits of the load withstand and plan the purchase of servers (or code optimization :-)) <br>  The first attempt was <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/154455/">here</a> <br>  In two days 2,000 people passed, but they came so evenly that the servers did not feel anything.  Plus, 90% of people were without cameras, and after seeing the text chat, they indulged in urogenital conversations with pleasure. <br>  This time we decided to apply the strategy that I once looked at with the same guys, who, unfortunately, I did not remember. <br><h6>  Short excursion: </h6>  My favorite once sent a link and offered to register for a free webinar, where they will tell you how to become happy, successful in sex and in business and stuff like that.  When I clicked on the link, the page was described about the same.  There was one field where you need to enter email.  It became curious - introduced.  I generated a link and gave a warning that you need to bring at least two friends through this link to participate.  Recalling the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2597%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0%25D1%2587%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25BE_%25D0%25B7%25D1%2591%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%2585_%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0_%25D1%2588%25D0%25B0%25D1%2585%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B5">story about the creator of chess</a> , where he asked to put twice as many grains on each cell, I presented a picture of the webinar approximately.  5 minutes before the start came an invitation to the post office.  People connected simply unreal crowds!  In general, a site for 50,000 users from different parts of the country lay down about 15 minutes after the start.  All this time, the video did not even turn on, only the general text chat worked. <br><h6>  End of excursion </h6> Without further ado, we decided to take this model and a friendly team created the same functionality. <br>  1. Set a testing date for October 21 at 8:00 p.m. <br>  2. Added honesty - they wrote that they started in the framework of testing the platform <br>  3. Added a sexual background.  On the first page they mentioned the possibility of dating, on the second, with a personal link, they indicated that it should be distributed to friends of the opposite sex. <br>  4. Left the cap from ‚ÄúTeledoctor‚Äù (target project) and when clicking on the label, you can go to the main site. <br>  The assembled base of electronic boxes has a special value.  Since these are people who have a camera and a microphone, they are physically prevented from using the doctor‚Äôs advice, which means that by the time the number of clinics in the system exceeds the first hundred, sending invitations to the service to these email addresses should be most effective. <br><br>  That's how we all came up with a sly and clearly.  It remains only to press the button and enjoy. <br>  Clicked.  It took a little less than a day, and the progression is precisely arithmetic.  About 100 people registered in the service, with 85% of them being girls.  I didn‚Äôt expect anything like that, since the gender connotation was aimed primarily at men.  Such reproduction is more reminiscent not of viruses, but of mammoths during an oncoming glacier. <br>  I will not deny that I expect some influx of users from Habra, but I understand perfectly well that there won't be tens of thousands.  If the virality was implemented qualitatively, the effect would be instant. <br>  More interested in debriefing, recommendations of experts, perhaps suggestions for the next campaign. <br><br>  <a href="http://teldoc.ru:81/Home/Join/8fa9784a-ec25-4ff8-af29-6a40d541c5cc">Look at the miracle of viral DNA sequencing here</a> <br><br>  So what is virality - the predicted result of quality labor, or a matter of chance? <br>  Thank you for attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/155497/">https://habr.com/ru/post/155497/</a></p>
