  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The concept of a hybrid home library, home server and the heart of a smart home</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello. <br>  Relatively recently, I visited the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãorganizing a single gadget in an apartment. <br>  What he should represent to me is not entirely clear.  This is a <i>hybrid of a</i> <b>home media library, a home server and the heart of a smart home that interacts with a mobile platform (preferably Android).</b>  Further I will try to describe what it must be of how to work, what is necessary for creation.  This text IMHO should attract the attention of not only home-made, but also people looking for where to invest money, because  a touch of innovation is present. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I'll start with the <b>prerequisites.</b> <br>  By organizing a large music library in the audio player Amarok.  Began to open the functions accompanying banal music playback.  Song ratings, statistics, tags to any track, creating auto playlists.  It was my favorite home radio station.  In fact, isn't it great when out of several hundred gigabytes of files - the flow of music that I need at the moment is created - in the mood (happy / sad), my favorite (based on the rating of each track that I listened to), etc.  etc. <br>  Thanks to this functionality came a couple of ideas. <br>  1. I want to collect statistics on the songs I heard not only on my computer, but also on a netbook (communicator, home media center).  Someone is enough to do this, but believe me, this is a completely different level because the statistics are not collected for the sake of numbers, but for the sake of creating sheets (when you have a sooo big audio library, you don‚Äôt feel like picking around to understand what you want to hear at the moment). <br>  2. I want to wake up and pick up the communicator to choose "I want invigorating music."  Automatically turn on the desktop or media center (or the communicator itself) with a stream of such music from your audio collection. <br>  Decision: <br>  1. MySQL server.  Amarok provides the ability to store your data on a separate server.  (Honestly, I have not yet used this function).  Further, it doesn‚Äôt matter what the music is playing on - the statistics about it will go to the database, the main thing is to have a connection. <br>  2. Wi-Fi router stitched by Linux will be a partial solution. <br><br>  It was the thought of such a router that gave rise to the first ‚Äúcontours‚Äù of the gadget in my head. <br><br>  <b>Soft:</b> <br>  <b>1.</b> Full operating system. <br>  <b>2.</b> Database (working as a server)

      <b>Iron:</b> <br>  <b>1.</b> Silent mini-computer (on budget components) <br>  <b>2.</b> Form Factor MiniITX (not fundamentally) <br>  <b>3.</b> Volumetric hard disk. <br><br>  <b>The main points associated with the operation:</b> <br>  <b>1.</b> Work 24/7 <br><br>  In addition to such a gadget, I am an adherent of the idea that with a home theater should not be a crutch for playing video files, but a computer capable of pulling video in maximum quality.  (Also a variant based on budget components) <br><br>  <i>But this will not surprise anyone.</i>  The highlight will be that the gadget (the heart of the whole media apartment) interacts not only with computers, but the MOST IMPORTANT WITH THE COMMUNICATOR. <br>  Here is a sketch: <a href="https://docs.google.com/drawings/edit%3Fid%3D19CgdAmNUQFhkEsoYoJduKN3079mkztp_cJZ3l4c5WQ0%26hl%3Dru">docs.google.com/drawings/edit?id=19CgdAmNUQFhkEsoYoJduKN3079mkztp_cJZ3l4c5WQ0&amp;hl=en</a> <br>  I will show everything with specific examples. <br><br><ul><li>  I have already described above that I woke up - I switched on the necessary music with a couple of clicks on the communicator.  Music will start on the device I need (DK / Computer / Communicator) </li><li>  Do many people have thermometers outside the window?  Here on Habr√© laid out instructions on how to connect the temperature sensor outside the window to the computer and monitor the degrees on the computer (and joked in the comments that it would not be bad to attach such a sensor to a small sick child).  In DIY on Saturday laid out the instructions where the information was transmitted to the wc-display.  And it would be ideal if the information through the gadget came to the communicator.  I woke up and not only turned on my favorite music from the communicator, but also looked at the temperature)) Since  the gadget works 24/7 and is connected to the Internet, then the temperature outside the window could be found anywhere.  Or share testimony on the web for all other people ... </li></ul><br><br>  Bundle: Communicator - Gadget - Comp to D.K.  - TV <br>  Control from the device by volume / image, etc. <br>  <b>With excellent development of the software interface in the communicator, it will be enough to make a couple of clicks to select a movie on the tracker and then watch it.</b>  <b>This is the future!</b>  No crutches in the form of flash drives stuck in a TV or Google TV.  <b>The future is for the software that will unite the communicator with a bunch of Gadget - Comp to D.K.</b>  <b>- TV.</b>  <b>And it will add all this with a COMFORTABLE INTERFACE.</b>  <i>I sit down in front of the TV and click the name of the movie in the communicator - search on the selected tracker / all / on the local network - select the required distribution - click on it and download started ... Meanwhile, a couple of clicks and now on the screen you‚Äôll see the latest YouTube videos from the channels for which you subscribe .</i>  <i>The download is over - an offer to leave to watch videos and start watching the movie.</i>  <i>All this is controlled by the communicator, no remotes.</i> <br><br>  It‚Äôs just not a plowed field for experimenting or training your imagination ... <br><br>  I do not know how things are with speech recognition in communicators ... Imagine you are driving a car - speak to your communicator - so that you look for such a movie on such a tracker with certain parameters in such a branch ... When you find the communicator, you ask again - you agree.  And so while you are going home, the movie you have selected is being downloaded.  Everything happens without even touching the phone. <br><br>  Having connected the split system to the gadget-heart (I don‚Äôt know, I was skillfully directly wired or having connected the IR remote control) on the way home I can be told to set the desired temperature in the apartment.  Or again, with the successful creation of the interface, do it in a couple of clicks. <br><br>  Voice control in the communicator and / or a good software interface that connects the equipment through the main heart-gadget will make you an old Hottabych in your apartment. <br><br>  <b>My main goal is not only to share the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãuniting the different directions of the ‚Äúsmart home‚Äù into a single whole (after all, almost everything I was talking about has already been implemented, but it has never been combined and controlled from a communicator), but to find like-minded people, try to develop this idea, systematize information about this and what the hell is not joking - can be found Kulibin-programmer with straight arms, which will create some kind of soft-base, on which in the future they will put their plug-ins on all other Kulibins-smaller ones.</b> <br><br>  PS Rummaged through several pages of the DIY blog - there are a lot of people who either create, connect to a computer and manage it.  There are many people who have a server at home.  But really, nobody wants or has not occurred to control all this without using a computer, but using only a communicator (for example, on Android). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/101242/">https://habr.com/ru/post/101242/</a></p>
