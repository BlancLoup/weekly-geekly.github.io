  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Give us a flash revolution! How to quickly and safely go to flash drives</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>Hi, Habr!</b>  Today we would like to talk about a new solution to speed up the transition to data centers that use flash drives exclusively.  HPE 3PAR's efficient StoreServ technology, along with StoreOnce protection, will help customers innovate their data center innovations.  But let's get everything in order. <br><br> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/hpe/blog/271763/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/62c/051/4cc/62c0514ccd504b20a82cb98d591d38ce.png"></a> <a name="habracut"></a><br>  The fact is that the new-old company Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), the creation of which we <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/hpe/blog/269915/">told</a> you not so long ago, integrated its solution 3PAR StoreServ and the new product lines of HPE StoreOnce and HPE StoreEver. <br><br>  The need for quick decisions, trends such as IT-as-a-Service, the development of data analysis tools encourage the use of flash memory.  In addition to the speed and the expected level of service, organizations that are switching to flash drives also benefit by about 85% in the storage space occupied by switching from traditional hard drives to higher density media.  According to IDC analysts, the effect of flash arrays on data storage and processing centers is indisputable.  More and more flash systems are able to offer the most advanced data storage services, including snapshots, cloning, replication, and quality of services.

      HPE 3PAR StoreServ arrays provide a variety of data storage services, and the recent update has made them the best in its class, ensuring record-breaking performance and availability.  And the price of such flash arrays starts already from 19.5 thousand US dollars. <br>  Modern flash platforms offer high flexibility and minimal risk, says Manish Goel, senior vice president and head of HPE Storage.  To meet the growing demand for such systems, Hewlett Packard Enterprise has released a line of 3PAR StoreServ enterprise-level Tier 1 flash arrays with integrated data protection. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#00b882">Data center on flash memory: it's time to speed up the transition!</font> </h2><br>  3PAR StoreServ Storage allows organizations to speed up the transition to a data storage and processing center that uses flash drives only.  These arrays help increase productivity and meet corporate level requirements.  Recently, the Storage Performance Council published a new world record in the SPC-2 test, which was held on the 3PAR StoreServ 20850 flash array. It is curious that it showed better performance than EMC VMAX 400K, the price of which is twice as high.  Building on this success, Hewlett Packard Enterprise introduces new products for the 3PAR StoreServ line: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>3PAR Flash Acceleration for Oracle</b> : increases database performance by up to 75% and allows you to not give up on existing systems, such as EMC VMAX.  Deploying such flash arrays is twice as cheap as upgrading existing storage systems. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>3PAR Online Import software</b> : a free license valid for 12 months for customers who wish to abandon their obsolete HDD-based storage, making the transition from EMC, HDS (and now IBM XIV) storage into five simple steps. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Support for 3D NAND drives</b> : Support for this new solid-state drive technology (SSD) allows customers to increase application performance while avoiding large investments. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#00b882">Reducing the cost due to a single flash array and active archiving</font> </h2><br>  Unlike arrays running exclusively on flash drives (All-flash Array, AFA) and designed for one type of media or only for SAN protocols, StoreServ Storage has a flash-optimized architecture that supports file and block access, as well as provides the ability to install HDD in most of its models.  Based on this architecture, HPE today offers 3PAR StoreServ 8200 Converged File and Block Starter Kit flash arrays that consolidate storage in one system and are about 26% cheaper than competitive systems.  To help customers deploy these unified systems, HPE has released several different modifications for 3PAR StoreServ Storage, particularly for the VDI and SharePoint environments, as well as leveraging HPE Software data management solutions. <br><br>  HPE also offers a fully updated portfolio of automated libraries and drives, including StoreEver LTO-7 tape drives.  This advanced line provides customers with a reliable data storage solution at an even lower price, with increased capacity and reliability.  The combination of high-performance 3PAR StoreServ flash arrays with updated tape storage gives customers the ability to deploy Tape-as-NAS and access tape archives as if they were on disk, which is ideal for an active archive. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#00b882">Integration of taxis: reduce the risk of data loss</font> </h2><br>  HPE also introduced solutions that are designed to help customers transition from traditional backup storage to flash arrays that provide deep integration at the application level.  Among such solutions is the new line of primary and middle class arrays HPE StoreOnce Systems.  These StoreOnce models are 2.7 times more productive and 2 times more dense than their competitors.  The cost of one gigabyte of storage is 0.05 dollars.  New models provide integration with applications from Oracle, SAP, Microsoft, Veeam and Veritas.  In addition, their use eliminates the need for separate management of backup processes. <br><br>  For customers who wish to upgrade to AFA, the new StoreOnce models have a built-in data protection solution, StoreOnce Recovery Manager Central (RMC), which takes snapshots of virtual machines.  Integration with VMware software allows you to quickly create and transfer Microsoft SQL snapshots from the 3PAR StoreServ array to any target StoreOnce backup system using HPE Express Protect technology. <br><br>  With integrated data management solutions, VMware vCenter and Microsoft SQL Studio speed up backup and restore operations.  In addition, the client will no longer need to pay extra for backup software from independent vendors.  And integration with Data Protector and RMC provides advanced virtual machine recovery options, provides detailed recovery and the ability to use storage resources on magnetic tape and in the cloud for effective long-term data storage. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#00b882">When (and how much) to wait for a flash revolution?</font> </h2><br>  And now we come to the most interesting - the issues of cost and availability: <br><br><ul><li>  3D NAND SSD drives will be available for order worldwide from December 17, 2015; in the US, retail prices start at $ 2075 for SSDs with a capacity of 400 GB or more. <br></li><li>  Starting from January 2016, 3PAR Online Import support is available for IBM XIV with 3PAR OS 3.2.2 MU2. <br></li><li>  From December 7, 2015, 3PAR StoreServ 8200 in Converged File and Block Starter modification with 8 HDD SAS drives (10,000 rpm, 600 GB capacity each), 12 SAS drives (7,200 rpm, capacity to 2 TB), OS Suite, Replication Suite, 3 years of round-the-clock support for HPE Proactive Care and a license for the 16-TB File Persona software package.  The retail price in the US will be 36 201 dollars. <br></li><li>  StoreEver LTO-7 tape drives and tape automation products will be available worldwide from December 1, 2015. <br></li><li>  HPE StoreOnce 3100 with a capacity of 8 TB for backup are available worldwide from December 14, 2015.  Retail prices in the US will be no lower than 5931 dollars. <br></li><li>  StoreOnce 3520 from 12 TB - US retail price from 8128 dollars. <br></li><li>  StoreOnce 3540 from 24 TB - US retail price from 10950 dollars. <br></li><li>  StoreOnce 5100 from 48 TB - US retail price from $ 25056. <br></li><li>  The StoreOnce RMC version 2.0 software package, which allows you to move data from 3PAR to StoreOnce for data protection, will be available worldwide from January 15, 2016.  Retail price in the USA will make from 540 dollars. <br></li></ul><br>  Ready to answer your questions in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/271763/">https://habr.com/ru/post/271763/</a></p>
