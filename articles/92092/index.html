  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Service Asus in the Czech Republic. Little positive</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="http://kolyan.cz/images/asusm50vc.jpg" width="320" height="334" align="left" hspace="10"><br>  The other day I happened to experience the quality of the work of the Asus service in the Czech Republic.  The M50vc, which I bought a year and a half ago, turned out to be very fast and durable.  There are no problems with modern resource-intensive programs and even games, although a lot of time has passed by computer standards.  The main problem was in the case, more precisely in the screen, which was easily scratched and the buttons of the mouse connected with each other by <nobr>some kind of</nobr> wand, which constantly broke. <br>  This was certainly annoying, but there wasn‚Äôt enough reason to give up the laptop for a while.  The fact is that the Asus service in the Czech Republic is located in the city of Ostrava (400 km from Prague) and I was somewhat confused by the scheme with sending the laptop.  But after a trip to Germany, the battery was completely discharged and blocked, and a week before it began to short charge.  I had to use the services of the service center. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Asusa has the Pick Up &amp; Return service, the courier from DPD takes your laptop from your home or work address and returns the repaired laptop to it.  There is a certain minus in it, because I work from different parts of Prague, and today I had to sit at home for half a day, waiting for the return of my electronic friend. <br>  Placed an order to restore the battery and replace the adapter.  Despite the fact that the problem was in the battery and the charger, the service said they needed to send the whole laptop.  Last Tuesday, a courier came to me, took the laptop, on Wednesday morning he was already in service, and the repair began.  I followed the repair process through a special order tracking interface.  On Thursday, I received a letter from the service saying that the torn charging cord is my bullying and will have to pay for charging.  An <nobr>invoice was</nobr> sent 450 CZK - charging, 153 CZK - work plus taxes, totaling 750 CZK (30 euros). <br><img src="http://kolyan.cz/images/asusm50vc_touchpad.jpg" width="320" height="240" align="right" hspace="10"><br>  I called to clarify why their charging does not withstand my use, they said that the wire is twisted and this is not normal.  153 kroons of work are always charged and cannot be removed from the account.  I agreed, because I considered charging for 750 kroons a good offer, a week before the incident I was going to order a 21-pound Chinese analogue on eBay for 21 pounds from England.  On Friday they wrote to me that your order is ready, wait.  But, the Czech Republic is an amazing country, even couriers do not work in it on weekends.  As a result, I received the cherished package only on Monday lunch. <br>  After paying the courier money for my order, I went home and began to unpack the laptop.  Included was a laptop and a new adapter, they took the old one for themselves, it‚Äôs a pity, I thought about digging and repairing it.  I take out a laptop and there is no chapel to my surprise, the screen cover has been replaced with a new one, the plastic around the keyboard and the touchpad (the one under your hands when you type) and the mouse buttons on the touchpad are also replaced with new ones.  The battery is also new, in spite of the fact that mine was still holding the charge very well. <br>  In general, it was this surprise that prompted me to write this flattering review about the company / laptop / service Asus. </div>
