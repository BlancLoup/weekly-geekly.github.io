If you‚Äôve been able to handle professional filmmaking in your hands, it‚Äôs easy to imagine the thrill of working with the Z10000.  If not, we‚Äôll give a simple example: it differs from an amateur camcorder in about the same way as a budget compact car from a limousine. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  What is what? </h4><br>  The main feature of the Z10000 is that it is the world's first 3D video camera with integrated optics that can shoot videos in the most advanced 1080 / 50p format today.  The new standard differs from the generally accepted Full HD-1080 / 25i mode in that here every second not 25 halves of the image containing even or odd lines are written into memory, but fifty honest full frames.  By the way, this is exactly the kind of film technology upgrade James Cameron was referring to, urging the studio to switch to a more progressive video capture and distribution system.

Two pictures on the same matrix arose due to a special stereoscopic attachment that was screwed directly onto the lens. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e66/f93/030/e66f930307ae5ad7af50f0530cadd59a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  So, in spite of the external similarity with the above described system, the HDC-Z10000 dual optics work in a completely different way.  Here we are dealing with two full-fledged lenses, each of which is equipped with a separate three-matrix module, so that a total of six matrices are already installed in the camera!  Moreover, the developers of Panasonic have equipped each lens with a very good optical stabilization system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/664/730/111/664730111cf89c9bbb54f6ce9252be17.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Even with a fully extended zoom (i.e., with a focal length of 320 mm in 35 mm equivalent), strong-handed operators can actually shoot on the Z10000 without a tripod. <br><br>  The meaning of using two independent optical paths is obvious: in this case, the frames for the left and right eyes do not have to share with each other neither the resolution of the optics nor the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe MOS sensors, however, the designers didn‚Äôt find such a complete split-up very easy.  The fact is that to create a truly high-quality surround effect, both optical-electronic paths must be identical and work perfectly synchronously.  And if the color rendition of the matrices can still be trimmed electronically, then the mechanics of the lenses should function with the accuracy of Swiss watches: when zooming or focusing on one lens, shift slightly more than the neighboring one, and the three-dimensional picture will simply scatter in front of astonished viewers. <br><br><h4>  How to work with it? </h4><br>  Taking up the "ten thousandths", you understand what the camera developers have deprived ordinary lovers of self-made movies in the fight for diminutiveness, simplicity (not to say primitive) settings and affordable cost. <br><br>  The device is healthy, heavy, and therefore it is a pleasure to shoot them.  The right palm lies comfortably on a huge servo lens.  For the zooming is not the slider, which is impossible to get a finger, but the massive "swing" that allows you to smoothly and accurately control the lens.  Optics are surrounded by a manual focus ring with an amazingly soft stroke - another typical attribute of a professional system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/77b/ef3/bf1/77bef3bf19f415cc53a232ca08880941.png" alt="image"><br><br>  On a 3.5-inch screen, you can see the scene in detail, and if shooting is done in 3D, then in volume.  True, the three-dimensional image on the monitor can be seen far from any angle - it is necessary, as it were, to catch the eye.  When shooting on a sunny day, you can use the viewfinder - the monitor in this case is hidden in a special niche inside the handle. <br><br>  Special mention deserves the audio path.  If desired, you can mount any microphone with a professional XLR connector on the handle, and a mixer with the ability to manually adjust the level of the signals turns the camera into a quality external recorder. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6c9/d14/378/6c9d14378b5679d52018fc2f5a395f4e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Image adjustments and auxiliary functions provided weight.  Fully adjusting the camera for yourself, the status of ‚Äúadjustors‚Äù can be saved in one of three memory cells, then to call up all the settings at the touch of a button. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/sNmqgwUYoa4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgKpD-2ZBI2lq_UT6FwbOkTzFUmpw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  Summary </h4><br>  Watching the footage was hard in the sense that attention was constantly focused not on the technical characteristics of the picture, but on the imperfection of its own cameramanship. <br><br>  The high frame rate of recording in combination with the excellent characteristics of optics and proprietary three-matrix modules makes a strong impression.  Another thing is that you need to be aware that the equipment of this class requires a serious approach to the skills of the operator. <br><br>  Intellectual automation mode is also provided here, of course, but is it worth it to lay out five thousand dollars to drive yourself into the framework of standard subject programs?  The weight and serious dimensions, striving for two kilograms, also impose their imprint on the shooting style, and the support for such a device is almost obligatory. <br><br>  In short, the Z10000 is not a cinema for everyone.  However, for those whose opportunities and camera ambitions extend even a little further than plots like ‚ÄúI was sunbathing on the beach‚Äù, I advise you to take a closer look at this device.  With its capabilities and picture quality, the price is 150,000 rubles.  certainly not seem overpriced. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/130185/">https://habr.com/ru/post/130185/</a></p>
