The embodiment of these I leave for you, I leave all rights to it to you.  All I would like to see is to see my nickname or name somewhere in the back streets of the author, but this is not necessary. <br><br><h4>  Prehistory </h4><br>  I often think through a few things that I would like to see and use in my lifetime. <br>  I think these ideas are completely collected, convenient and, in some ways, beautiful. <br><br>  Modern technologies make it possible to reproduce them in several versions, which gives a lot of room for dreams. <br>  I will not attach the pictures: the artist from me is no yes and now there is no possibility, but I will try, if there is time in the evening, to draw something.

      And yes, in any case - the OS is not important. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Idea one </h4><br>  Imagine a transparent bar.  Let it be cast in yellow, purple or any other color - it will be your screen and touch keyboard. <br><br>  On the sides there is a metal wrap: it allows you to protect the screen itself when it falls.  At the same time, if it protrudes slightly from above, it will also protect the screen from scratches.  From crumbs will not save, but from a flat wooden surface - completely. <br><br>  Also, if we add some voids inside, and make the metal not thick (but not soft enough to bend by hand), then when falling, we will only get the metal bending with the protection of everything else. <br><br>  For this wrapper (half a centimeter thick, for example) there is still additional functionality: <br><br><ol><li>  There is a battery hiding.  As I know (and maybe I'm wrong), there is no transparent battery, so this solves many problems. </li><li>  The processor and similar opaque periphery, including the USB stick. </li><li>  Touch buttons (one for one side) - for which I will explain later. </li><li>  Connector for connecting to charging and computer. </li></ol><br><br><h5>  Principle of operation </h5><br>  It's simple.  A transparent screen allows you to look at it from two sides in any inverted state. <br>  In most cases, we look downwards and slightly tilted to the ground, so using a gyroscope to calculate how to turn the screen and where to display the top, and where is the bottom (and on what screen it is easy to calculate).  Ensure the opacity of the entire screen allows us our palm, which we usually hold the phone. <br><br>  Thus, we always know for sure that the screen will be turned to us by one side, no matter how we get the phone from our pocket. <br><br><h5>  What are the touch buttons </h5><br>  I put in them two functionalities, ranging from the usual changes in the volume of the sound and ending with the lock on changing the position of the screen. <br><br>  More precisely, it looks like this: <br>  You decide to read lying on your back on the train.  When you take a telephone into a river, you close the two sides with your hand (in the horizontal position - the lower, or the upper (or both), or the lower / upper and two lateral, and in the vertical position, the lateral and lower / upper or both lateral).  Thus, we provide a gyro lock at the program level. <br><br>  In this case, you can portray beautiful patterns on the edging, and the screen speaks for itself. <br><br>  I would use. <br><br><h4>  The second idea. </h4><br>  I think this idea will appeal to many. <br><br>  It is more economically justified, and in practicality is not inferior.  I call this phone a transformer. <br>  Programming, and many things of the usual everyday life, have come to modularity.  When one part can be replaced by another and we get a similar, but different device. <br><br>  In this case, the idea is more trivial, but also easily expandable. <br><br>  Imagine the underlay: the usual underlay for the phone.  Something like a hull. <br><br>  In it, I can insert a small square with a processor, a small rectangle with a microsym or for an ordinary sim card.  Bluetooth module, WiFi module, attach a battery cover to the back, and a touch screen in front ... Or a screen with a keyboard ... Or a keyboard from a player ... <br><br>  In case I break the screen - I can buy a new one.  Separately.  And just snap the old one.  Or replace on the way.  New processor out with more memory?  Bought, set. <br><br>  Wanted another color?  Buy another substrate.  Want to expand your device?  Replace any module with an extension. <br><br>  All modules can be hooked up under the screen / battery. <br><br>  When changing under the battery, it gives protection for the OS and parts burnout - removed the battery and replaced it.  When changing under the screen - removed the screen, replaced (the processor-module is not worth changing), put the screen, and the OS is still working and at the same time found a new device, has already installed and is ready to go. <br><br>  Oh yes, the drivers for them can be stored right in the module itself, so that there are no problems. <br><br>  This device will be pleasant not only geeks, but also ordinary people, because  removes a lot of economic problems - you can increase the power of your phone (or whatever you collect from it) gradually.  Parts will always be needed.  Removed the issue of repair - it is cheaper to buy a new one.  Well, etc. <br><br><h4>  Total </h4><br>  I would use such devices. <br>  Extensions of these ideas can throw in the comments, as well as (as will be expected) the inexpediency of such ideas. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/165843/">https://habr.com/ru/post/165843/</a></p>
