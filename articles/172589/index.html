The event will be broadcast live on Youtube.  In the first-cell smartphone will be shown a day later - on March 15.  In the meantime, we offer to plunge into the abyss of rumors, conjectures, fantasies and frank fakes, which the Internet is full of on the eve of the launch of the new device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d15/2d3/111/d152d31114ace59e4acc8c44ab4ac20c.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, what did the yellow (and not so) pages come up with since the first news about the development of the new Samsung flagship?

      <b>Screen</b> <br><br>  It's no secret that Samsung Electronics is actively working on flexible displays.  Prototypes of mobile devices ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/microsoft/blog/165477/">ONCE</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/165311/">TWO</a> ) based on these technologies were already presented in January this year at Mobile World Congress 2013. Of course, after this, rumors began to circulate that the company plans to use this technology in the new flagship GALAXY. <br><br>  ‚ÄúFlexible displays are great, they can be twisted, worn on the wrist - many possibilities, limited only by our imagination.  Plus, the flexibility of the screen allows for a high degree of durability by using a plastic substrate, which is thinner, lighter and much more flexible than any LCD technology-based screens, ‚Äùsaid a Samsung spokesman in an interview with the BBC. <br><br>  It is expected that the flexible OLED screen on the Fourth Galaxy will be equipped with Full HD-resolution (1920x1080) or even higher, and its diagonal will be as much as five inches (on the face of a violation of the Samsung GALAXY Note II niche).  More modest and realistic expectations on the part of the screen are reduced to the usual LCD Full HD, Super AMOLED (RGB, like GALAXY Note II) and the screen diagonal is not more than GALAXY S III. <br><br>  The Hi-Tech.mail.ru portal at the MWC 2013 exhibition came across a <a href="http://hi-tech.mail.ru/news/misc/samsung_galaxy_s4_powervr.html">curious stand</a> demonstrating the evolution of Super AMOLED-matrices.  The 4.99-inch display with Full HD resolution and pixel density of 440 ppi became the extreme point of the development of Samsung technologies.  It would be logical to assume that this is the same screen for the very same smartphone. <br><br>  <b>Specifications</b> <br><br>  In recent months, there has been no shortage of supposedly leaks in the specifications of the Fourth Galaxy: they have not announced any secret data about Samsung extracted from the camp, except, lazy. <br><br>  According to the Korean site Ddaily, the Fourth Galaxy will carry a quad-core Exynos processor, built on the 28-nm standard.  process.  It will be smaller in size, and faster in performance than the processor hidden inside the Samsung GALAXY S III.  New processors, along with an increase in speed, should take a focus on improving the efficiency of interaction between the cores.  And this, in turn, means that the Fourth Galaxy will be able to quickly and simultaneously handle many tasks and work for a long time from an autonomous power source. <br><br>  There are suggestions that the new smartphone will be equipped with WiFi 802.11ac technology, also known as 5G + WiFi.  Roughly speaking, with such mobile Internet capabilities, web surfing speed can be equal to a wired connection.  Another source, <a href="http://www.android.gs/samsung-galaxy-s4-specs/">androidgeeks</a> , claims the device has a Broadcom BCM4335 chip, which includes WiFi 802.11ac along with Bluetooth 4.0 and FM radio. <br><br>  Some people are convinced that the Fourth Galaxy can be equipped with the new eight-core Samsung Exynos 5 Octa processor ... of course, if you can believe these screenshots of comparative <a href="http://www.sammobile.com/2013/01/18/galaxy-s-iv-makes-an-appearance-in-antutu-benchmarks-confirms-exynos-5-octa-cpu/">benchmark tests</a> .  The model numbers SHV-E300S and GT-i9500 were previously mentioned as possible identifiers for the new GALAXY smartphone, and screenshots were taken in the popular benchmark application AnTuTu.  They show that the processor under test has a speed of 1.8 GHz, which corresponds to the capabilities of the eight-core Samsung Exynos 5 processor. In addition to the higher power and speed of the new product, it is possible to offer a longer battery life. <br><br>  There is another unconfirmed <a href="http://lazytechguys.com/news/benchmark-test-for-the-galaxy-s4-gets-leaked/">leak of benchmark results</a> from the portal LazyTechGuys.com.  If this is not a fake, then the results are really impressive. <br><br>  On January 4, SamMobile website published unconfirmed <a href="http://www.sammobile.com/2013/01/04/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-s-iv-leaked-press-release-shots/">specifications of the new Samsung flagship</a> , allegedly obtained by their spy scouring the company's camp.  They look like this: <br><br>  <b>Processor:</b> Exynos 5450 Quad-Core CPU, 2.0 GHz <br>  <b>Graphics processor:</b> Mali-T658 GPU <br>  <b>RAM:</b> 2 GB <br>  <b>Screen:</b> 4.99 inch diagonal, SuperAMOLED, Full HD resolution (1080 √ó 1920) <br>  <b>Main camera:</b> 13 megapixels <br>  <b>Front camera:</b> 2 megapixels <br>  <b>Operating system:</b> Android 4.2.1 (out of the box) <br><br>  <a href="http://lazytechguys.com/news/benchmark-test-for-the-galaxy-s4-gets-leaked/">The specifications</a> provided by the LazyTechGuys portal on March 4 look like this: <br>  <b>Processor:</b> SoC Exynos 5 Octa; <br>  <b>Graphics processor:</b> PowerVR SGX 544MP <br>  <b>RAM:</b> 2 GB <br>  <b>Screen:</b> 4.99 inch diagonal, Full HD resolution (1080 √ó 1920) <br>  <b>Main camera:</b> 13 megapixels <br>  <b>Front camera:</b> 2 megapixels <br>  <b>Operating system:</b> Android 4.2.1 (Jelly Bean) <br>  <b>Connectivity:</b> Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.0, NFC <br><br>  A month earlier, the specifications found on one of the android forums were published on the same site: <br><br>  <b>Operating system:</b> Android 4.2 w / TouchWiz UI <br>  <b>Screen:</b> 5 ‚Ä≥, 1080p Full HD Super AMOLED +, protective glass Gorilla Glass 3 <br>  <b>Processor:</b> 2 GHz A15 Exynos 5450, quad-core <br>  <b>RAM:</b> 2 GB DDR3 RAM <br>  <b>Graphics processor:</b> ARM Mali T658 GPU <br>  <b>Main camera:</b> 13 megapixels <br>  <b>Front camera:</b> 2 megapixels <br>  <b>Battery:</b> Lithium Ion, 3.100 mAh <br>  <b>Memory:</b> 16/32/64 GB <br>  <b>Network:</b> 4G, LTE <br>  <b>Connectivity:</b> Bluetooth 5.0 <br>  <b>Optional:</b> SD memory expansion slot, dedicated camera release button, front speakers <br><br>  But it goes around the large information portal GSMarena.com, which, based on a lot of rumors and real leaks, collected such an impressively detailed information <a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_s_iv-5125.php">plate with technical characteristics</a> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/da0/509/3ce/da05093ce1482eb434c555ecbf5271ab.png"><br><br>  <b>Concept art, layouts, renderings and fakes</b> <br><br>  On January 4 of this year, SamMobile portal showed a photo of the new GALAXY smartphone: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/115/896/722/1158967220bb0da8ae8aee925a5cbb10.jpg"><br><br>  We see a huge display, framed by an even thinner frame than in the previous generation S III, and all the navigation buttons under it are completely abolished.  Despite the realism of the picture, there is an assumption that this is only a high-quality fake, made from combined images of GALAXY S III and GALAXY Premiere smartphones. <br><br>  Another unnamed render showed all the same LazyTechGuys: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e49/eba/6c6/e49eba6c63ace8cc56f4809574d63ab4.png"><br><br>  And this concept appeared on one of the French forums at the end of January: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/00a/c10/9ab/00ac109abf0e335bcbd3c39d2b4e6ff6.jpg"><br><br>  The most uncomplicated layouts were made by craftsmen from an online retail store of mobile devices called Expansys: in early March, the following bricks appeared to the world: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ccc/623/37c/ccc62337ca997f26616396c2534f9e1f.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2c4/e32/538/2c4e3253828c643557f2d2eb155dfe38.jpg"><br><br>  But most of all the noise was caused by yesterday‚Äôs leak, which the user of the Chinese forum 52samsung.com shared with the world.  The author claims that GALAXY S IV, adapted for the local Chinese market - with support for two SIM-cards, fell into his hands.  The model has the number GT-I9502 and is equipped with a 13-megapixel camera (Sony IMX135 Sensor, but without 3D), an Exynos 5410 Octa processor, a PowerVR SGX544MP3 graphics accelerator and 2 GB of RAM.  The screen of the smartphone was created using the new Green PHOLED technology, and the thin frame around the case is made of aluminum. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9f5/ad1/cf4/9f5ad1cf401ad9fbe01f0e7fbb1af992.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0d6/77e/be6/0d677ebe6e36391f5b4ad1952660f601.jpg"><br><br>  Here is a set of rumors, myths and legends, we have collected for your information.  Which of them will be confirmed, and which will remain empty speculation - we will know very soon. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/172589/">https://habr.com/ru/post/172589/</a></p>
