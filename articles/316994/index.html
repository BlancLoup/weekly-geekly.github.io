    <ol><li>  <b>Do not respect the opinion of experts</b> .  Although, what kind of experts are there.  You're their boss, and therefore the main expert.  In all!  Your opinion is the most correct!  Does your specialist suggest something?  Cheeky  How can he ?!  After all, you know better how to do it!  Make him public in public and provide murderous arguments proving that his idea is a bad one.  Not enough arguments?  - put pressure on authority.  There will always be reasonable, thinking about their career and loyal to the business people who support you. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Consequences</b> : most likely this situation will lead to the fact that your experts will no longer express their opinions.  Initiatives will not be from anyone, well, maybe only from new ones, until they understand the rules.  Some will leave.  Usually, even the most highly qualified manager cannot be an expert in everything.  But an employee can be an expert in his field.  You hired him for that, right? <br><br></li><li>  <b>Treat people like careless slaves</b> .  They are the same.  Even if a person seems to be full of cool ideas at the interview stage - when you hire him, treat everyone like that - do not forget to check, preferably without warning what he is doing, let him write it down - why he does it.  Justifies - and then suddenly he squanders the time for which he is paid.  Still taking the initiative?  Even more control in his actions (see point 1)! <br><br>  <b>Consequences</b> : amazing, but how a person behaves, and how they behave with a person has mutual consequences. <br><br>  Remember the experiment on the replacement of internal motivation to external: <br><br>  Children played football in the yard.  Grandpa didn't like it.  Grandpa was smart.  He went out to the children and said that they play beautifully and that he will now pay them a dollar.  This went on for a week.  Then he said that they were playing well, but his situation worsened and he could only pay 50 cents.  A week later, he said that he could only pay 10 cents and the children said that they were not ready to play for 10. <br><br>  [An example was in the course of Stratoplan, unfortunately I don‚Äôt remember the link to the source] Constantly kicking an employee, the manager receives either a statement on the table (from hard nuts) or a gradual decrease in the employee‚Äôs internal motivation.  After all, a specialist does not need to check.  He came to work for you, because he considers important, the work that you offered him.  By checking it with or without, you change its internal control and the requirements for yourself to external. <br><br>  <b>Exception</b> : in my opinion, an exception is made by low-skilled employees who came to ‚Äúoverwinter‚Äù or sit out until you got another job.  But this does not apply to IT staff and other "demanding brain" specialists. <br><br></li><li>  <b><s>Kill</s> fire for mistakes</b> .  That's when people stop making mistakes.  If a person has found a mistake, arrange debriefing: who made it?  The guilty must be punished!  Well, if the person himself found his mistake - punish him!  Justice in everything is the motto of the present leader! <br><br>  <b>Consequences</b> : people will be more and more afraid to take the initiative - then it will be NOT their mistake.  In addition, errors will try to hide.  As a manager, you will receive information later, or even not receive it at all.  Think about it, whether you aspire? <br><br></li><li>  <b>Humiliate people</b> .  Better with a public demonstration.  From this, they only become more diligent.  Try to show your superiority in every possible way.  Your ideas are the best.  You are the best.  Make fun of your subordinates and show them what incompetent idiots they are and with whom you have to work !!! <br><br>  <b>Consequences</b> : you rally the team against yourself.  They will support each other, sympathize and call you "for the eyes" ... depending on the elegance of your employees.  Perhaps you will acquire a number of interesting and entertaining nicknames.  And of course they will consider you an idiot.  You after all achieved this goal?  Is not it so? <br><br></li><li>  <b>Do not acknowledge your own mistakes</b> .  You just can't have them.  You are perfect.  This is careless slaves, something is not understood.  What?  Do you have a written order?  This is a forgery!  And vice versa - all the good moments happened, because you, as a sensitive manager, sent the employees along the right path.  And they still rested! <br><br>  <b>Consequences</b> : not recognition of the achievements deprives the experts of a pleasant cherry on the cake.  Recognition that the expert is useful for the organization.  Do you take it all yourself?  And why do you need it?  You're self-confident, aren't you? <br><br></li><li>  <b>Do not thank</b> .  No one and never.  They do their job right?  Get paid for it.  Thank you - this is too much! <br><br>  <b>Consequences</b> : well, there are solid pluses.  You save a lot of time - you don‚Äôt have to say ‚Äúthank you‚Äù.  In general, gratitude in business etiquette is something obsolete.  Nobody thanks you.  By the way, I wonder why ...? <br><br></li><li>  <b>Change your plans without explanation</b> .  Be unpredictable.  What?  They have already fulfilled 90% of your order and spent half a year on it?, You did not say to do it!  You may have been thinking out loud.  Well, what a ram!  That is necessary - do not do!  What is not necessary - they do !!!  Also time wasted !!! <br><br>  <b>Consequences</b> : here is a delicate moment - remember, you asked Vasya and Petya for the task to work on the weekend?  Ah, well, of course, do not remember, because it is such a trifle.  And then he was not allowed to go on vacation, because he had to finish it urgently?  Now both Vasya and Petya know that they did it absolutely in vain.  Do you think they will do this in the future?  It is clear that sometimes projects are canceled due to a changed market situation.  In this case, we must try to not only you, but also Vasya and Petya understand this, that is, the reasons why they worked on the weekends and on vacation, and now it must be thrown into the garbage! <br><br></li><li>  <b>Save on development tools, monitors, office - on everything!</b> <br><br>  <b>Consequences</b> : highly qualified specialists work for you, and since the market dictates the salary, you cannot save money on it.  Saving money you are likely to increase the time that the developer will spend on work.  That is, you will save on the second monitor, but pay the same, or even 2 times more money, as a developer‚Äôs salary, for what he could have done faster, if he had enough equipment and / or software to speed up the process development. </li></ol><br>  By following this small list and following all the tips carefully and accurately, without losing important details, you can become one of the worst leaders in a relatively short period of time. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/316994/">https://habr.com/ru/post/316994/</a></p>
