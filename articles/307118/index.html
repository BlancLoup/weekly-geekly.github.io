No, have not heard</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  Introduction </h4><br>  If you, dear reader, are a hired employee, more recently your employer is obliged every month to submit a report for you to the Pension Fund called SZV-M. <br><br>  This abbreviation stands for ‚Äúlist of insured persons, monthly‚Äù and is a list of persons with whom the organization has established employment relations. <br><br>  Why do you need it?  Well, according to Putin V.V., there are " <a href="https://lenta.ru/articles/2013/06/13/budget/">too many accountants</a> " in our country, therefore, we have made another monthly report. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

    <blockquote>  The measure has been discussed in Russia for more than ten years: it is believed that due to the strong differences in the two types of accounting in the country, there are too many accountants (there are three million accountants in Russia, which is 2.5 times more than in the USA). </blockquote><br>  If you ask why it is needed, this report, the answer will be quite ridiculous.  This is necessary in order not to index the pension to working pensioners.  Yes, exactly: in the current oil realities, and also considering that the Pension Fund‚Äôs budget consists of about half of direct subsidies, it‚Äôs not profitable. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In general, working pensioners would first like to completely retire the pension, but here they themselves understand that the elections, everything, therefore, have so far left. <br><br>  In short, we made another monthly report, hung it up at enterprises, accountants (of which there are too many) cursed, but continued to eat this cactus of yours. <br><br>  It would seem, where does trim?  &amp;? <br><br><h4>  &amp; </h4><br>  Anyone who has mastered reading at least Wikipedia on the subject of XML knows that when trying to do this, it will not be very good: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e4f/177/619/e4f177619e5c4c7fb1b0bd11ece0e28d.png"><br><br>  Therefore, invented to do so: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6d3/37a/16f/6d337a16fa954b378e4cf2d7d005cc38.png"><br><br>  That is, the &amp; character has essentially become a escape character.  And if I want to put somewhere &amp;, then I need to write &amp; amp; <br><br>  And then suddenly there is an organization whose name contains this symbol.  What do you think, whether such a report passes to the Pension Fund?  No, we get an error. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5d3/07f/ef5/5d307fef5d0149629bd78d80cf874a33.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/806/db8/9c3/806db89c394a404db3e461813b396970.png"><br><br><h4>  Trim </h4><br>  The excellent report of SZV-M to the Pension Fund is essentially simple.  It is necessary to give a list of people who work.  At the same time, it is necessary to indicate their SNILS (this is a unique number for each), as well as their full name (it is completely unclear why). <br><br>  A full name is unloaded in the file like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a7e/cae/ed2/a7ecaeed298949f5a0498dc7dcea32bd.png"><br><br>  Well, in the above example, the data for Dmitry Anatolyevich will successfully load, but for Igor Ivanovich there will be a mistake. <br><br>  Yes, the developers in the Pension Fund have not heard about Trim.  Never. <br><br>  And the problem is that to see this space, if you open it in Internet Explorer (which is the default look), it will never work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a83/5a5/14e/a835a514e41a4df49ec78024226d4233.png"><br><br><h4>  Uncertainty principle </h4><br>  Well, as a dessert, let's talk about how to give up and how this report is received.  Heisenberg?  Do not make me laugh. <br><br>  So, here you have sent a report, and forgot to overcome the spaces.  In Russia, the legislator rarely worries about such cases, in the law it is either all good or all bad, but life is more complicated.  Therefore, the options are: <br><br>  1. You receive a positive protocol, but in the attached text file, the Pension Fund asks you to submit this form with the note ‚Äúcomplementary‚Äù not for everyone, but only for those people who have gaps.  You are not obliged to hand over anything, in general, but the Pension Fund will not lag behind you. <br><br>  2. You receive a negative protocol, but in the attached text file, the Pension Fund asks you to submit this form with the note ‚Äúcomplementary‚Äù not for everyone, but only for those people for whom there were gaps.  You must pass this form, otherwise there will be a fine. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1d0/e8b/c2e/1d0e8bc2ec534e05856af5b3e56169a7.png"><br><br>  The fun is that the same Pension Fund in the same cases can produce both a positive and a negative protocol.  Elementary particles are nervously smoking. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/307118/">https://habr.com/ru/post/307118/</a></p>
