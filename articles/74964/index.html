  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Results of the past seminar on open source software in the city of Irkutsk</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  So, the seminar "Free about free.  Familiarity with Linux and free software is over.  It took enough time for everyone who wanted to say something about the seminar to do it.  It was nice that there were a lot of such people.  As always, there are those who liked it and those who found it a waste of time.  It is interesting to read all opinions, each of them is valuable in its own way for the organizers. <br><br>  Let us sum up the results and we, the organizers themselves, and at the same time tell you how it was, where, in fact, begin. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The day began quite early, despite the fact that it was a Saturday, there was a lot to do.  We needed to have time to bring the equipment, prepare an assembly hall, make a network for distributing repositories and distributions, and ensure the operation of the presentation equipment.  We were allowed into the hall only an hour before the start of the seminar itself, so it was necessary to do everything extremely quickly and in an organized way.  Thanks to all people from Lugov, for coming and helping.  Lesson was found for everyone.  Arranging chairs, bringing tables for organizing workplaces, building a network, putting up a screen, setting up a projector and a large amount of equipment to work in this network, someone even had to make friends with sound equipment, and when you see it all for the first time, it is rather difficult, but our new sound engineer did not let us down.  The projector turned out to be especially harmful equipment, he didn‚Äôt want to connect with the second screen, had to make it the only one, and he immediately tuned into the working mode. <br><br>  Already in half an hour the guests began to arrive, by this time a lot had already been done, at least, they were sitting where they were, they were met in the hall of the first floor and asked them the right direction.  There were a lot of people interested in Free software, the number of guests was close to two hundred, but there was enough space for everyone.  A large number of visitors immediately rushed to the tables to which the network was laid, where they downloaded free software distributions and updated their systems.  Only now the speed of all these pleasures was not very good, it is worth considering the number of people who want to get a new distribution kit or update for free, the information was downloaded in 5 streams, even the gigabit switch did not save.

      Since the beginning of the seminar I had to stay a little bit, just a few minutes, well, this is a common practice for our country, small, as they say, technical problems.  The first speech was the welcoming speech of the president of the non-profit partnership "Community of Users of the Linux Operating System".  Then, as usual, the speakers spoke.  The first part of the seminar was devoted to free software in general.  Of course, not all reports were equally interesting and well presented, but we will fix this in the future, although you shouldn‚Äôt blame the excitement, not everyone will be able to cope with it masterly and read your report without hesitation.  Also, the problem was the rehearsal, we simply had nowhere to hold it.  The next time the speakers will prepare better, we promise.  However, even this circumstance did not prevent the listeners from becoming interested in the topics of the reports.  They willingly asked questions and even periodically helped with the answers.  Of particular interest was the program 1 C and its compatibility with Linux, even a discussion on this topic developed.  Also, students were interested in the issue of the legal status of open source software in Russia, and everyone came to the conclusion that if this is not prohibited, then why do we need permission.  However, later we did clarify this issue with lawyers and even found several documents on software licenses, which are now posted on our website. <br><br>  After the first part a short break was organized, where visitors simply poured into the technical sector of the hall.  There, everyone got distributions and consultations.  Ubuntu 9.10 OS was especially popular, as it was supposed to, more than 80 disks with Ubuntu 9.10 distribution were distributed, many asked to burn an image on their flash drives, OpenSUSE, Debian, AltLinux also readily dispersed on flash drives and open source software.  Our technical experts even with difficulty coped with such a flow of volunteers, so it was decided to organize distribution distributions in the near future, by prior orders, which will also be announced in advance. <br><br>  Considering that the seminar was timed to coincide with the release of the new Ubuntu 9.10 OS, the second part of the seminar was entirely devoted to the Ubuntu operating system, it was told about its settings, graphical interfaces, as well as advantages and disadvantages.  The second part was somewhat shorter, and, considering the problems with the dispenser (for some reason, he refused to heat the water, we had to run around with the kettles), the remaining guests were offered, without distracting the entire audience and speakers, to go to the table in small groups, drink aromatic coffee and treat yourself to buns and sweets.  Many people especially remember this part of our seminar.  Also during the break, distribution of distributions and answers to questions of our specialists continued, and at the same time, those who wished could purchase T-shirts with the symbols of the event.  Being charged with the atmosphere of the event, many communicated simply among themselves, learned about preferences in each other's distributions, provided all possible assistance to those in need of advice, but our specialists enjoyed particular popularity, they advised, gave advice and simply helped as they could. <br><br>  The third part was devoted to our organization, that is, LUG 'in Irkutsk, its legal status, what it was created for, how it can be joined and under what conditions. <br><br>  In the future, it is planned to hold such events regularly, as well as all sorts of InstallFests, Linux and IT parties. <br><br>  Thanks to all those who did not refuse to help us, who got up early on Saturday morning to come and create a working environment, to those who supported us to the very end and kept order, who helped to clean up at the very end, and of course, without gratitude sponsors, too, nowhere.  Thanks to Business Network Irkutsk for financial assistance and to Irkutsk State University for help in organizing. <br><br>  You can familiarize yourself with photos, videos (professional video recording of the entire event was conducted, as well as the reportage of the local TV channel), reports and presentations on our website <a href="http://linux.irk.ru/viewpage.php%3Fpage_id%3D4">Link to materials</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/74964/">https://habr.com/ru/post/74964/</a></p>
