  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Everyone wants to leave a mark</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  And how good and simple it all began!  Some two million years ago, people did not even suspect that after some insignificant, on an Ecumenical scale, their life would depend not on how clearly they scraped out the address of their cave in the local system of mountains, but on how well they can adapt to the conditions of the surrounding growing world, oppressive society and an armada of computers from nowhere.  They could draw charts of the starry sky on the earth, considering that the latter is concave inward, show their children the rock stories with illustrations and watch the same rock porn. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And now?  Now life is becoming less and less interesting.  It becomes predictable.  People in such a life unconsciously make decisions that were made by their friends, neighbors, relatives.  The choice has already been made for them, they can only press the "Accept" button in their seemingly considerable skull box.  And many people click.  Many do it consciously, arguing that it will be much calmer for them than if they had suddenly fought off the pack.  The instinct of self-preservation takes its.  People cannot be blamed for wanting to live.  To live like everyone else: quickly, confidently, predictably, as if on rails. <br><br>  Life today is a quick succession of successive events.  Someone will remember filmstrips, someone will immediately see Twitter, others will shout out something about Yahoo! .. All these services (except, perhaps, the first, yes) - particle accelerators - very well fulfill their purpose.  The developers, perhaps, did not even think about what they were doing; it could have happened at the level of their subconscious.  Anyone would like to live faster.  Anyone is flattered by high speed. <br><br>  Open the profile of any Twitter user, cover the date of each message with a pencil, and a person‚Äôs life will flash in front of you at a speed more than enough to say ‚ÄúYes, he's a particle!‚Äù.  Look at what you or others tweet.  Look carefully.  See nothing unusual?  Similarities?  Twitter is an instant camera.  If you prefer, you can call it a modern Wilson camera.  We, the particles, passing through the chamber, leave our mark on it.  He is, of course, different from others.  It differs by the angle of inclination, thickness of the track, brightness of the glow.  Each individual track parameter characterizes the particle that left it.  On this track, we can judge what the particle was.  We even know which magnets stood on the edges of the chamber, and we can tell on whom they acted to a greater degree, and who did not even change their previously planned course.

      However, in this camera over time, all the tracks go out.  They can't shine all the time.  Someone stays longer, the rest go faster.  A laboratory physicist, after conducting his experiment, carefully puts Wilson's camera in the closet, locking it with a key, takes his notes.  Turning off the lights in the laboratory, he goes home.  He has nothing more to do here. <br><br>  Each of us wants to leave a larger footprint in the universe than a dug pit two meters deep.  It was always, at all times.  For the past few years, we have not only been trying to step on Einstein‚Äôs trousers, but also to document this sentimental, important moment in the first place for ourselves wherever we can.  Ponder why there are so many personalized services on the Internet?  No, do not say that developers want fame, money, female fans and male fans ... No, this does not mean that people have large complexes or poorly recognized syndromes. <br><br>  If you look a lot deeper, one of the oldest and most likely reasons for the emergence of such services is fear, which we discussed above.  Now a person has not only the opportunity to write about himself on the wall of a neighboring house, but also to leave his photo archive on the Internet, to pamper himself on Habrahabr, to boast on Twitter or to show off with his own blog.  Yes, and you are right, that they are driven by fame and money, because, after all, fame is also a trace.  Your name will be added to Wikipedia in several languages ‚Äã‚Äãof the world at once!  You will be pleased with yourself, if this happens during life! <br><br>  Today you can not live life without leaving a single trace.  You will not be able to remain yourself completely, you will not be able to disown what is happening around.  You can, of course, fly to Mars and open a colony there: build factories, produce newspapers, launch steamboats and rush asteroids to the moon, but the evil moonmen will still get you and show you who is the master in space. <br><br>  Everything that you read, of course, you could not read.  It was possible to go directly to this paragraph, but I did not warn anyone about this, sorry.  This is all one big metaphor that has eclipsed your mind now.  You are the last words damn her author.  Wait, he's almost finished his hypnosis session.  Try to live life as a Martian, and not as a resident of the Earth.  Look from the side on this planet, on all the people inhabiting it.  Notice what kept your eye on this planet.  Beauty of nature?  Scary or curious events?  Cruel, beautiful and predictable people?  Think about whether you wanted to be among all this? <br><br>  While thinking, sit back, stretch your legs forward, place them on the next table.  Lift your laptop off the floor, wipe its dust cover off.  Open, turn on your Windows 7, go to Twitter and write there that you had a great day today.  You are so unusual, and so many beautiful people are reading you!  Close your eyes. <br><br>  Three two one.  Click! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/58136/">https://habr.com/ru/post/58136/</a></p>
