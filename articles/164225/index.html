In ReactOS, since then, there have been quite a few important changes that deserve attention. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c5b/762/514/c5b76251431726ad5b03f6c7b27987d2.jpg" alt=" ,        , " title="Marat Karatov, Alexey Bragin and Rechitsky Alexander in Hyper Cuba, Skolkovo"><br><br><h4>  Participation in the <a href="http://www.iconvention.ru/">convention</a> in Skolkovo </h4><br>  The organizers of the Zvorykinsky project invited us to the final event - the Innovative Convention.  It is remarkable that it took place in Skolkovo itself, in the new building ‚Äú <a href="http://community.sk.ru/press/hypercube/">Hypercube</a> ‚Äù, so we decided to definitely attend this event in spite of a 26-degree frost (In the NSC at that time it was -45, so it is a sin to complain about the weather) . <a name="habracut"></a><br>  According to Alexey Bragin: <br><blockquote>  Omitting various trifles (like those that we somehow did not make it to the finals in a truly magical way), the event was organized at a very high level, the composition of guests and speakers was quite impressive. <br>  It all started with a plenary session entitled ‚ÄúGlobal Innovation Networks.  The limits of the effectiveness of the cooperation of the scientific community and innovation.  Initially, it fully justified its name and Tim Rowey set forth in some detail the truism of the business, but after his speech, Sergey Belousov took the floor and immediately ‚Äúbrought‚Äù the leader with a question by the moderator - ‚ÄúCan you announce the memory session topic?‚Äù, The second question was asked to everyone present on the podium - ‚ÄúDo you understand what this topic is about?‚Äù.  No one was able to answer, including the moderator, which already meant that Belousov's speech would be interesting and ‚Äúin essence‚Äù.  So actually it was, time was not wasted.  Other speakers (for example, Pekka Viljakainen from Skolkovo) also said interesting things. <br>  Subsequently, during the Convention, we managed to communicate with many very interesting people, both familiar and new ones.  For example, talk with the head of FADM S.Yu.  Belokonev, tell ReactOS to the Minister of Communications and Mass Media Nikolai Nikiforov, talk about startups with Tim Rowe, Bob Dorf and other guests. <br></blockquote>  Photos from the event are available in our groups and profiles of social networks. <br><br><h5>  Organizational highlights: </h5><br><ol><li>  New site <br>  During the year, two versions of the new website for the ReactOS project were proposed: This is a site based on Typo3 and on Drupal 7 (at that time Drupal 6).  Work on the site has become very active lately, and Drupal 7 seems to be the most likely candidate to become the new CMS for the site reactos.org.  Changes also affected the appearance of the site.  A respected habr community is invited to conduct the first trial stress test of a new website at <a href="http://new.reactos.org/ru">new.reactos.org</a> .  Based on the results, we will evaluate the performance of this configuration and optimize it. </li><li>  Published a <a href="http://new.reactos.org/content/november-2012-meeting-minutes">summary of the</a> status meeting for November 2012 () </li><li>  Heading for the return of Virtual PC and Hyper-V as a target platform. <br>  Unjustly forgotten Virtual PC is a good virtualizer for detecting various bugs in the OS.  Hyper-V is a working and very popular platform, so its support will become a priority for ReactOS in the near future. </li><li>  December status rally postponed to January </li></ol>

    <h5>  Changes in the course of development: </h5><br><ol><li>  Hermes Belusca worked on a new implementation of the CSRSS subsystem (branches / ros-csrss branch), and also fixed several VirtualPC-specific bugs in the work of com-ports and the debug system. </li><li>  Aleksey Bragin fixed a few old bugs in the implementation of an alternative win32 subsystem Arwinss </li><li>  Johannes Anderwald successfully passed all exams and returned to work on the USB driver stack.  Corrected many already quite tired mistakes. </li><li>  Jerome Gardou and Timo Kreuzer made a number of improvements to the CRT library related to localization support and compilation using Visual Studio. </li><li>  Amine Khaldi synchronized shared modules with the new Wine release. </li><li>  Timo Kreuzer fixed a number of problems in RTL, CMLIB, HAL, etc. using a code analyzer from Visual Studio. </li><li>  Thomas Faber found the strength to organize a code review of the branch with the further development of explorer_new, which was the result of the successful work of a student on the Google Summer Of Code program, and flooded these changes into the trunk. </li><li>  Cameron Gutman fixed several network stack errors (CORE-6655, CORE-6741) </li><li>  Eric Kohl continues to systematically work on the implementation of SAMLIB, NETAPI32 and related code. </li><li>  Alter (the author of UniATA) actively corrects the code of its driver for use in Virtual PC. </li></ol><br><br><h5>  Office 2003 and Windows Media Player </h5><br>  Several testers reported that Office 2003 and Windows Media Player started to run and work in the trunk.  Before that, this was only possible in the ARWINSS build. <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/xlIMsYy3S08%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjq3nHVXsmiu73C0Csw0i8GLykFuQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Thank you for the video provided by Alexander Evsikov. <br><br><h5>  We need support again! </h5><ul><li>  Very <a href="">important competition</a> with a prize fund of 3 million rubles, held by Cisco.  Selection is based on various criteria.  Possible automatic passage to the semi-finals, which depends on your votes!  A couple of days ago, we were suddenly surpassed by competitors, I hope the Taras community will not give us a grudge. </li><li>  Another equally <a href="http://www.dellchallenge.org/projects/reactos">important competition</a> with a comparable prize pool is held by Dell.  In it, we also need your votes, this time it depends not on getting to the next stage of the competition, but on getting a separate prize. </li></ul><br><br>  <i>Gentlemen minus, gain <b>courage and indicate the reason for your negative evaluation of the topic</b> in the comments, or scary to express your opinion?</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/164225/">https://habr.com/ru/post/164225/</a></p>
