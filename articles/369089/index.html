    <a name="habracut"></a>  Nikolay Iosafovich was born on July 16, 1914 in Moscow.  His father was a well-known and respected professor of mathematics at the Petroleum Institute.  I.M. Gubkin.  Mother - a student of the same institute, she studied at the Faculty of Mathematics (by the way, there they met Chistyakov senior - he was her professor).  But she chose jurisprudence as a profession and, after she graduated in absentia from one of the law schools, began working in her specialty. <br><br>  From an early age Nicholas was attracted to the exact sciences and to all technical devices.  He collected his first radio detector at 11 years old.  And at the age of 15, a young radio amateur entered the Moscow Telegraph Technical School, where he studied communication technology.  And in 1932 he went to study at the Moscow Institute of Communication Engineers (now MTUCI) for the evening department.  Most of the scientific life of Chistyakov is associated with this educational institution.  By the way, in parallel with his studies, he came to the position of senior technician at the Reutov communications center, and a few months later he moved to the Research and Development Institute of Communications.  Starting to work as a simple technician Chistyakov gradually grew to a leading engineer. <br><br>  Nikolai was a very capable student and studied successfully at the institute.  Together with like-minded fellow students he was included in the accelerated group.  Thanks to this, he passed the exams ahead of schedule and graduated from the institute in just three and a half years. <br><br>  Teaching activity Chistyakov began in 1935.  While still a student at MIIS, he began to teach a course of radio receivers in the specialty Radio Communication and Broadcasting.  After graduation, he entered graduate school.  And at 22, the young specialist published his first scientific article ‚ÄúFluctuation Noises in Electronic Tubes‚Äù.  A year later - the book "Bandpass Filters and Amplifiers" (one of the first in the USSR in this area).  In 1939, Nikolai Iosafovich successfully defended his thesis and became an assistant professor in 25 years. <br><br>  When World War II began, Chistyakov was already a recognized radio technician, he was working on his doctoral dissertation.  He was repeatedly called to the front as a specialist in the development of radio-technical equipment for domestic aviation.  At the same time, the scientist worked at the Scientific Research Institute of Aircraft Equipment (NISS), where from a senior engineer he reached the head of the department.  Significant Victory Day Nikolai Iosafovich met in Berlin. <br><br>  In 1946, Chistyakov defended his thesis and received the degree of Doctor of Technical Sciences.  And two years later he returned to teaching.  In 1952, Nikolai Iosafovich was given the academic title of professor and he returned to MTUCI, where for 35 years he headed the department of radio receivers.  But Chistyakov also lectured at many other large institutes of the USSR, such as: Moscow Aviation Institute, Moscow Energy Institute, Moscow Aviation Technology Institute, Moscow Higher Technical School.  Bauman, All-Union Correspondence Electrotechnical Institute of Communications and others.  Also at the department under his leadership, research work was carried out, inventions were created. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/901/5d8/24a/9015d824a5344f0c83b478da59bbd6d3.jpg"><br><br>  <i>MTUCI</i> <br><br>  In the years 1957-1961 Chistyakov was deputy head of science at the Radio Research Institute.  This university was one of the largest research institutions.  In its walls the most significant radio engineering devices were invented.  And from 1966 to 1970, Nikolai Iosafovich served as vice-chairman of the Study Group (SG) II ‚ÄúRadios‚Äù of the International Advisory Committee on Radio (ICRC) at the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).  And from the beginning of the 70s he became the vice-chairman of SG III ‚ÄúFixed service at frequencies below about 30 MHz‚Äù. <br><br><h4>  The role of Chistyakov in the scientific and technical literature </h4><br>  This eminent scientist made an invaluable contribution to the scientific and technical literature of the USSR, highlighting the most significant world and domestic achievements in the field of radio engineering.  For 11 years he headed the magazine "Radio Engineering".  He was also a member of the editorial board of the technical journal "Electrosvyaz", publishing houses "Radio and Communication", "Knowledge", "Russian Language", "Mass Radio Library", scientific adviser to the publishing house "Big Soviet Encyclopedia". <br><br>  Since 1936, Chistyakov began to publish in scientific journals.  He is the author of more than 100 scientific articles covering important issues of radio engineering.  Most of the results of his research were included in books and textbooks on radio receiving equipment.  A number of articles are devoted to terminological issues and issues of teaching radio engineering in universities.  The editions of the Great Soviet Encyclopedia (second and third) contain a number of Chistyakov‚Äôs articles on radio receiving equipment and radio communications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a04/6e4/0b8/a046e40b82734d4c8e9878ebb5fb6512.jpg"><br><br>  <i>Great Soviet Encyclopedia</i> <br><br>  In 1937, Chistyakov published the first textbook, Bandpass Filters and Amplifiers.  A year later, he published the remarkable monograph Resonance Amplifiers and Pre-Selectors.  Beginning in 1948, he published five more textbooks for universities of communications in radio receiving technology.  It is for these books that many Soviet signalmen studied this subject. <br><br>  In total, Nikolai Iosafovich wrote 38 books, more than 150 articles, 35 copyright certificates, 57 candidates of science prepared by him.  Many of his books and articles have been reprinted and translated into English, German, French, Chinese, Bulgarian, Romanian, and Ukrainian. <br><br><h4>  Contribution to radio engineering education </h4><br>  Chistyakov did his best and the educational field, having done a lot for the development and improvement of radio engineering education.  For more than 20 years he was the head of the Presidium of the Scientific and Methodological Council for Higher Radio Engineering Education, and also served as Deputy Chairman of the Main Terminology Commission of the USSR State Standard, was on the board of the Knowledge Society, was a chairman of the radio receivers section and a member of the Bureau of the Historical Commission of the Central Council of NTORES. .  A. S. Popova, was a member of the governing bodies of the NTO Priborprom them.  N. I. Vavilov and the All-Union Council of the NTO. <br><br>  Nikolai Iosafovich was popular as a lecturer and he was repeatedly invited to read courses of lectures by leading universities of the country: MEI, MAI, MATI, MVTU, etc. Chistyakov spoke fluently in three European languages ‚Äã‚Äãand from 1945 to 1973 was a member of USSR delegations for the 33rd international meetings, international forums, assemblies.  Due to this, he visited 14 countries around the world.  Eight times Nikolay Iosafovich was a member of the international commission of UNESCO, was the vice-president of the Soviet national committee of UNESCO.  The scientist contributed to the development of international relations of the technical community of the country.  At the UNESCO Congress in Paris, he met and became friends with the famous English science fiction writer <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BA,_%25D0%2590%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D1%2583%25D1%2580_%25D0%25A7%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25B7">Arthur Clarke</a> (one of the science fiction "big three").  These two talented people for a long time corresponded and shared ideas.  By the way, in his articles Chistyakov described in detail the creation of the famous project of global satellite communications systems, which Clark wrote about. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f32/b8b/9b7/f32b8b9b7a7d4870acd0eaf99a91a6f8.jpg"><br><br>  <i>Sir Arthur Charles Clark (1917-2008)</i> <br><br>  The scientific community of the country highly appreciated the merits of Chistyakov and in 1974 he was awarded the title of Honored Scientist and Technician of the RSFSR.  And in 1989, he was elected a corresponding member of the USSR Academy of Arts, and in 1993, he was a full member of the Housing and Communal Academy of the Russian Federation. <br><br>  Over the years of research activity, Nikolai Iosafovich embodied his ideas in more than 30 inventions.  Until 1948, he received 24 copyright certificates for various improvements to various devices.  Quite interesting inventions in the field of antenna technology, in particular, for receiving signals with polarization spacing in the range of short waves.  The last of his copyright certificates dated 1985. <br><br><h4>  Love Chistyakova to the history of radio engineering </h4><br>  Nikolai Iosafovich was a talented teacher and, as a teacher, he realized his responsibility to students - the future of radio engineering.  He considered it very important, along with the training of technical skills and new technologies, also to convey to young specialists the historical development of the industry.  To show by example how new generations of scientists were born, inventions were created.  In short, to demonstrate the entire evolutionary path of radio engineering.  Chistyakov believed that precisely this would contribute to the formation of not only a high-quality specialist, but also a creative, spiritual, comprehensively developed personality.  And now such a person will consider it his duty to continue the work of his predecessors and devote himself to science. <br><br>  Nikolay Iosafovich devoted a lot of time to the deep study of radio engineering, having written many papers describing research and the most important inventions in this field.  He got to the fundamentals of electromagnetic radiation, which arose even before the discovery of the existence of radio waves.  The historical works of Chistyakov showed that the creation of radio engineering is a landmark event in the history of our civilization, meanwhile, having a dynamic character.  This process involved many scientists who were constantly in search of ideas.  And each of them contributed to the overall development of radio engineering. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b0b/d07/45e/b0bd0745eca74021a32e74aefb08b834.jpg"><br><br>  <i>Tutorial "Radio receivers"</i> <br><br>  He wrote a very interesting historical article "75 years of the Russian Society of Radio Engineers", highlighting the work of one of the oldest societies in Russia (created in 1918).  The founders and members of this organization were many prominent Russian scientists and engineers. <br><br>  Chistyakov wrote a number of bright portraits of Russian scientists and engineers who made a significant contribution to the progress of radio engineering.  For example, he described in detail the activities of P. N. Rybkin and D. S. Troitsky, who discovered the possibility of clearly receiving weak signals by ear.  This made it possible to significantly increase the sensitivity of receiving devices and increase the communication range. <br><br>  Chistyakov above all appreciated truth and justice.  In many of his works, he tirelessly urged to consider the development of radio technologies as a kind of complex process in which many bright minds of the planet participated.  Starting with G. Hertz, who proved the existence of electromagnetic waves and carried out their artificial radiation and fixation.  Therefore, Nikolai Iosafovich considered the officially accepted and widely popular point of view that everything relating to radio was invented by one person, A. S. Popov, to be biased.  Chistyakov certainly recognized and highly appreciated the merits of this scientist in the development of domestic and world radio engineering, but opposed the idealization of the individual. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/604/c8f/9ce/604c8f9ce7bf4189ae047313cde5f52e.jpg"><br><br>  <i>Thunderbolt A.S.</i>  <i>Popova</i> <br><br>  He recalled G. Marconi, who, independently of A. S. Popov, contributed to the practical development of radio.  Popov assembled a light meter, picking up and recording lightning discharges.  It was the first radio device unilateral action.  But at the same time, Marconi invented the wireless telegraph and conducted transmissions using a key and Morse code over decent distances.  Chistyakov urged to equally evaluate the merits of both scientists. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/35d/dab/879/35ddab87981c4fa0a1b16aa5c05a4e63.jpg"><br><br>  <i>Guglielmo Marconi with his invention</i> <br><br>  Such a bold and controversial generally accepted position from such a prominent scientist as Chistyakov could not remain unnoticed.  The professors began to write complaints to the Central Committee of the CPSU, demanding the exclusion of the ‚Äúbalamut‚Äù from the party, from the Scientific Society of Radio Engineering, Electronics and Communications, where he more than half a century headed the section of radio receivers.  As a result, Nikolai Iosafovich had to resign "at his own will" from the post of chief editor of the magazine "Radio Engineering". <br><br><h4>  Afterword </h4><br>  Nikolay Iosafovich Chistyakov was one of the outstanding teachers in the field of radio engineering.  His lectures were distinguished by a high scientific level, problem, brightness and clarity.  He proved himself not only as an excellent lecturer, but also as a thoughtful methodologist.  Thousands of Soviet engineers mastered radio engineering on lectures and numerous books.  Dozens of his students became scientists and took an active part in the improvement of domestic radio communications equipment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/41e/d11/882/41ed11882938412ab261953478ac2d01.jpeg"><br><br>  During his life, he spent a fantastic amount of research and educational work, leaving many scientific works to descendants.  With the help of it, programs were developed for training students of radio engineering courses in educational institutions of the country, dozens of scientific, educational and popular science books on radio engineering were published.  Nikolai Iosafovich Chistyakov was a great scientist and a worthy man. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/369089/">https://habr.com/ru/post/369089/</a></p>
