  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Wearable technology will help tennis players improve their skills</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Welcome to the pages of the blog <a href="http://www.icover.ru/">iCover</a> !  The capabilities of wearable technology have reached such a popular game as tennis.  The touch sensors, built into the tennis racket and worn like the already well-established fitness bracelets, were combined in a tandem with a special software shell by the developers in the framework of a single multi-touch system PIVOT.  Development that allows you to get comprehensive information about the level of individual training of the player will enable professional tennis players to hone their technical skills, and for beginners to significantly speed up the process of learning and mastering popular techniques. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1dc/b4a/def/1dcb4adefd7be92e41d698fa9f4ff392.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The product offers to amateurs and professionals of tennis a whole range of possibilities that are inaccessible in advance, using several technologies patented by the authors of the development.  A unified system of motion capture, wireless data transmission and their subsequent instant software processing using a specialized program was developed by <a href="http://turingsense.com/">TuringSense</a> .  As an assistant, Nick Bollettieri, a world-class practicing trainer who worked with tennis stars such as Venus Williams, Serena, Andre Agassi, and Maria Sharapova, joined the group of engineers at the development stage of the multi-touch complex PIVOT. <br><br>  Accelerometer, magnetometer and gyroscope built into each sensor provide high performance, reliability and accuracy of reading and processing information.  Autonomous power sensors carry built-in batteries.  Data processed at a rate of 100 frames / second is transmitted wirelessly to the main ‚Äúsensor - hub‚Äù, which transmits the data stream to the cloud for further processing, analysis and obtaining the final result.

      Schematically, the process of ‚Äúwithdrawing‚Äù the tennis player‚Äôs dynamic information card looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/089/220/69e/08922069e098b55bad8ed8d1aceca6f5.gif" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9d7/608/50d/9d760850dc92d0258607bdb07a43a812.gif" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f75/a57/8ac/f75a578acc6641ef8c1600687c116414.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/911/2f6/464/9112f646451442b4b2ad84d9629f927b.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">Wireless sensor system</font> </h2><br>  Reading the detailed information on the body movement becomes possible due to the activation of the motion and turning sensors located as shown in the figure above.  The layout of the sensors is designed in such a way that at each time point to cover the whole range of movements performed by the athlete during work on the court.  According to the authors of the development, compact PIVOT sensors are smaller and lighter than any existing analogs implementing motion capture technology.  Each sensor the size of a large acorn weighs only a few grams. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/686/231/718/686231718c184621800ceadf13d6c23a.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f4e/391/a2f/f4e391a2fe4245a6b54c4f64df3b7f58.png"><br><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">Analysis of biomechanical processes</font> </h2><br>  A team of experts - biomechanics and professional coaches with the participation of Nika Bolletieri spent years understanding the complex processes of human movement and their impact on the quality of a sports result.  In collaboration with the company's engineers, an advanced algorithm was developed for analyzing the biomechanics of an athlete‚Äôs movement, which allows to translate raw data obtained in real time into specific results of personal assessment of equipment, form and energy distribution.  Cloud technology allows you to process large amounts of data at high speed, which makes it possible to analyze the data obtained as accurately and efficiently as possible. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/965/0cb/c64/9650cbc641f9454183a102c4d049e0fd.png"><br><br>  With the program PIVOT, the user can not only track the movement of the racket, but also view, evaluate and understand the whole process of impact in dynamics.  Sensors broadcast all the data set necessary for analysis throughout the session, and the result is a detailed summary of the positions of the legs and body, the quality of the beats being played and other useful information. <br><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">Instant situation assessment</font> </h2><br>  The program allows you to create and customize an individual training scheme.  At the same time, the achieved results or errors are instantly recorded and can be voiced also in real time by means of easily identifiable sound alerts.  So, for example, when the intended goal is achieved (correct execution of the technical reception), the sensors will immediately fix this fact, the program will decipher the data and the athlete will receive a corresponding sound notification that the ‚Äúbarrier is taken‚Äù, which means you can fix the last result. <br><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">Library</font> </h2><br>  One of the useful features is access to the data library, which, according to the program developers, is a training center with advanced features.  At the same time, a tennis player can form a separate section with his ‚Äúbranded‚Äù movements and techniques.  During the gaming session, the athlete is constantly in the feedback mode, receives instant feedback of the signal processing results, and after the end of the training, he can view the results in a 3D retrospective, compare them with the selected standard and draw the necessary conclusions. <br><br>  One of the library's possibilities is access to the techniques and advice of professional trainers (Nika Bolletieri and others) and world-class athletes.  Moreover, personal trainers of athletes will be able to customize the program in such a way as to organize the most productive communication with students, focusing on the most important aspects of the current training period. <br><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">3D picture</font> </h2><br>  PIVOT hardware-software training complex allows you to play pictures on the screen of a smartphone, laptop or tablet in 3D format at any time, repeatedly view them in rotation at a viewing angle of 360 degrees, in the right speed mode in the smallest detail, paying attention to the details, often escaping the attention of amateurs, and often from professionals. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/059/02f/ee3/05902fee30ebbda5cd08dfc2265a9de1.gif" alt="image"><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/OXXVp1IUIPU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhCZbCND2KpEwxd9hlkPDf3Z469CQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Today, TuringSense is conducting a campaign to raise funds for the commercial release of the active learning system PIVOT.
