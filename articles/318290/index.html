  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Magic hosting in the Netherlands, excluding consumed server resources, is updated and cheaper than anywhere else.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Almost two years have passed since the moment when we <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/ua-hosting/blog/253563/">announced for the first time a hosting service with transparent and 100% understandable charging</a> .  We refused to consider all the resources consumed by the customers of the dedicated CPU / RAM / IOPS server and took into account only the traffic.  After all, this is the most understandable and transparent for the client.  Especially for users who are only interested in how many visits to their projects will be provided by a particular tariff plan and how not to lose visitors as a result of hidden hosting provider restrictions or sudden overload, do not get a denial of service. <br><br>  We were convinced from our experience that we were right that we should not measure the load in parrots, as not quite honest colleagues do, for example, indicating the allowable load in the CP, while keeping silent about the characteristics of the node's processor, giving only a vague explanation: <br><br><blockquote>  CP is an abstract value that characterizes the amount of processor time spent by processors on processing user processes, obtained by standard linux kernel tools.

      The value of this parameter depends both on the site attendance and the site itself, on the connected modules, etc.  Therefore, it is possible to estimate what kind of load will be created by this or that site only approximately and upon detailed study of the site.  In this case, it is more correct and faster to transfer the site to us and see the load created by it. </blockquote><br>  And it‚Äôs not at all indicating that the allocated 65 CP is almost nothing, and it will still depend very much on the node's processor, not only on the frequency, but also on the instructions that one or another processor supports.  What is clearly at some stage generates conflicts with users who were expecting one thing, but actually got something completely different.  But that is ... <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Today we want to inform you that our solution is being updated, in view of the experience gained, transparent work has allowed us to satisfy the needs of many subscribers, without receiving a single complaint due to vague or imperfect charging.  Now we are ready to provide reliable, understandable and updated magic hosting already for hundreds of thousands of our future users, further dropping prices and even adding basic DDOS protection, the ability to use multiple IP addresses without add.  payments and other interesting free buns.  For even greater simplicity in the selection, only 4 tariff plans are still available, which differ only in the number of sites and traffic (the number of pages viewed by your visitors per month in your sites): <br><br><blockquote>  SSD BASIC <br>  Quota: 3GB SSD <br>  Full sites on the account: 3 <br>  Databases: 3 MySQL <br>  Approximate number of page views *: 300,000 <br>  Cost: $ 0.99 per month </blockquote><blockquote>  SSD BUSINESS <br>  Quota: 10GB SSD <br>  Full sites on the account: 10 <br>  Databases: 10 MySQL <br>  Approximate number of page views *: 1500000 <br>  Cost: $ 2.99 per month </blockquote><blockquote>  SSD ENTERPRISE <br>  Quota: 30GB SSD <br>  Full sites on account: 30 <br>  Databases: 30 MySQL <br>  Approximate number of page views *: 7,500,000 <br>  Cost: $ 5.99 per month </blockquote><blockquote>  SSD VIP <br>  Quota: 100GB SSD <br>  Full sites on account: 100 <br>  Databases: 100 MySQL <br>  Approximate number of page views *: 15000000 <br>  Cost: $ 9.99 per month </blockquote><br>  * For the calculation, an average size of a web page is 700 KB, the number of views is the result of dividing the monthly traffic by the average size of the web page, for example, for the minimum tariff plan 200 * 1024 * 1024/700 = 299 593.14.  Thus, if the average page size of your website is lower, for example, 200 KB, not 700, you can get much more views - 200 * 1024 * 1024/200 = 1 048 576, and vice versa. <br><br>  Our hosting in the Netherlands on SSD-drives without regard to server resources consumed can be <a href="http://www.ua-hosting.company/hosting">ordered here</a> . <br><br>  Now: <br><br>  - At your disposal at least 2 twelve-core 2xIntel Dodeca-Core Xeon E5-2650v4, 48x2.2GHz processors with hyper trading (we abandoned the use of 4 processor platforms and increased the number of nodes several times, and due to the fact that new processors have more cores, newer generation and updated instructions, the solution has become even more productive for each subscriber and also more cost-effective); <br><br>  - We reduced the Internet channel to 1 Gbit / s on each of the nodes (it was at least 10 Gbit / s), because no one had experienced such heavy traffic and such a channel was purchased only to filter out possible attacks and provide continuous service, Now, on the side of the root router, automatic protection against DDOS attacks is implemented, and we provide protection for all our subscribers free of charge, subject to attacks that do not exceed 1 Gbit / s, which also reduced the cost of the service; <br><br>  - Now you can use 3 public IP addresses for FREE, within the same hosting account, do you need some more pi?  Acquire an additional hosting account on another hosting node, or buying dedicated IP will help to ensure your needs. <br><br>  Among other things, we provide: <br><br>  - Convenient control panel ISPManager 5 Business; <br>  - Ability to select the PHP version for a specific website (PHP 5.2, PHP 5.3, PHP 5.4, PHP 5.5, PHP 5.6 or PHP 7.0); <br>  - While most hosting providers still use ‚Äúslow‚Äù SATA hard drives, providing no more than 50-140 read / write operations per second (IOPS), we build solutions exclusively on SSD solid-state drives that provide 50,000 IOPS and more! <br>  - <b>Free transfer from another provider on request</b> and free SSL certificate Let's Encypt! <br><br>  Limitations: <br><br>  - For the chosen tariff plan, only the maximum number of visitors per month is limited ‚Äî traffic, nevertheless, you can purchase as much traffic as you need, increase your tariff plan to the limit you need; <br><br>  - Since the consumed traffic is inextricably linked with the consumed CPU / RAM / IOPS resources - we practically do not apply their limitations, because due to the productive equipment, consumption is instantaneous, which allows using the resource of hosting servers fully and more efficiently; <br><br>  - It is prohibited to host projects on the hosting server in order to traffic proxies, convert media files or perform other similar complex calculations (standard sites do not fall under these restrictions, meaning computing processes take up minutes of CPU time, as when converting large video files); <br><br>  - It is forbidden to host political sites, sites subject to DDOS attacks (over 1 Gbit / s), as well as resources blocked for users from Russia by Roskomnadzor or with a high potential risk of such blocking; <br><br>  - The norms for using the network, adopted by the OFISP working group, as well as the Offer Agreement, must be fully observed. <br><br>  Why are prices so low?  I will quote <a href="http://searchengines.guru/showthread.php%3Ft%3D948670%26page%3D3">my own answer</a> from the discussion on a large well-known webmaster forum: <br><br><blockquote>  The problem is now that just these ‚Äúhosting companies‚Äù of 1 person, alas, but for the most part (I will not summarize at all, there are very professional people who have something to respect and who truly provide an individual approach) , bring to the market is not good, but destruction.  For dumping, providing services at prices below a reasonable limit, cause an outflow of customer base from providers with decent quality services, forcing them in turn to lower prices and sell services at times below cost. <br><br>  After all, prices for hosting services have already become much lower than 5 years ago, while resources are greater and servers are also more powerful, probably, by an order of magnitude.  The question is why it is impossible to save the prices of 5 years ago, if the orders are identical, and the charge is.  are the boards now higher than 5 years ago? <br><br>  After all, if we take away these orders, we come to the conclusion that in order to provide quality hosting services, prices should be identical (or even higher, if we are talking about decent wages for staff), only the number of included resources should change. <br><br>  The low threshold price for starting a ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù hosting, led to the fact that Wednesday came idiots, only to earn, not provide quality service, and in attempts to monetize, they go to great lengths to crush providers that provide higher quality. <br><br>  And they can. <br><br>  You can say for a long time that there are customers for whom quality is important, but in fact, it turns out that people are so accustomed to saving money that it plays "tremendous importance" for them, the difference in cost is $ 4 per month.  And they will go to order for a dollar, even if falling and lagging hosting without support, than for 5 something magical and convenient.  They go to rivet gs, search spam, to "earn" a penny on SEO, than the SDL (site for people).  Have you seen many new interesting projects lately? <br><br>  But sites for people has become much easier to do.  Only another problem arises, they, as a rule, do not immediately bring money and have to work very hard, and this is not interesting to anyone. <br><br>  The huge problem is that non-professionals have filled the market and now trust, especially adequate hosting providers, is hard to get.  Since many of these charlatans put high prices on the background of low prices, providing the same low quality, but already for big money and some clients have a certain stereotype in connection with this, why pay more for the same? <br><br>  Are you satisfied when the quality of 80% of hosting services is low?  I am not. <br><br>  And we will change it.  How?  We sell even cheaper at a loss.  We will not inform charlatans, they will also easily lose customers as they received.  After all, if earlier clients went to them, because the price differed by "5 rubles", and games of defectors were arranged, when somewhere the price became lower than the ruble, how do you think, what effect will there be if the difference is "100 rubles" ? </blockquote><br>  Of course, that prices in a year or two can be revised, we will look at the results.  But now you have the opportunity to try a really high-quality service, at a low price, without pitfalls. <br><br>  Perhaps this service will prove to be a good basic step for you before choosing a full-fledged analogue of a dedicated server with even more extensive features and fewer restrictions, which have already been recognized as very cost-effective <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/ua-hosting/blog/317282/">by many Habrahabr</a> and <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/ua-hosting/blog/283048/">Geektimes users (the service received dozens of pre-orders before it was started)</a> : <br><br>  <a href="http://ua-hosting.company/vds">http://ua-hosting.company/vds</a> - virtual servers in the Netherlands with dedicated drives (a full-fledged equivalent of dedicated servers for 95-99% of web projects): <br><br>  VPS (KVM) - E5-2650 v4 (6 Cores) / 10GB DDR4 / 240GB SSD / 1Gbps 10TB - $ 29 per month <br>  VPS (KVM) - E5-2650 v4 (12 Cores) / 20GB DDR4 / 480GB SSD / 1Gbps 20TB - for $ 49 per month <br>  VPS (KVM) - E5-2650 v4 (6 Cores) / 10GB DDR4 / 4TB SATA / 1Gbps 10TB - $ 29 per month <br>  VPS (KVM) - E5-2650 v4 (12 Cores) / 20GB DDR4 / 2 x 4TB RAID1 SATA / 1Gbps 20TB - for $ 49 per month <br><br>  We expect your comments and feedback. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/318290/">https://habr.com/ru/post/318290/</a></p>
