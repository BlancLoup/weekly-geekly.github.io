For whom it is already not interesting, please skip a few paragraphs. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/81d/075/dfd/81d075dfde5d3088ccfbf2deb1449781.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Further. <br>  What opportunities a creative person gives Kikstarter probably everyone already understands - to launch their innovative project without exhausting searches for the means to implement it.  Without wandering through the banks, without a long, and often unsuccessful, search for business angels and waiting for answers from venture capitalists that they are not interested in your project at such a degree. <br>  However, not everyone still understands that for a successful launch of a project on a kickstarter, it is not enough just to have a brilliant idea.  You need to work hard to prepare the project for the start.  It is necessary to create a good video and articulate your idea in textual form before offering visitors to the site to buy your product before the start of its production.  To increase the chance of a positive result, you need a working device prototype or a demo version of your game. <br>  As it is known on Kickstarter, the sale of your product occurs in the form of publishing bets (lots), which are agreed to pay by the clients (backers).  A bet is in essence an opportunity to buy your products and accessories to it a bit cheaper than it will cost when it goes on sale.  This draws the attention of customers and forces them to purchase your product before it hits the market, and you, in turn, receive the funds necessary to start production.  Accurately calculate the size of the rates, in order to interest the Beckers and at the same time not to lose, is not an easy task, especially taking into account the logistics! <br>  In addition, you assign the minimum amount that you plan to collect and the time required for this.  The amount must be high enough to cover both the costs of production and delivery as well as the costs of remuneration for the rates.  In addition, during the whole period of fundraising, you should warm up the interest of the backers, regularly putting out additional information about your product and the process of preparing for production, and answer their many questions.  Yes, do not forget that before you bring the product to the site, you need to take care of creating a legal entity in the States or England, under the ‚Äúroof‚Äù of which funds will be raised.  It will be very difficult to count on success if you do not have your own website on which the product is presented.  Well, finally, the company is strongly raising the chances of success by warming up the interest among potential customers, which should start before the start of the project.  To do this, you need to prepare press releases and find supporters of your product on thematic forums ... <br>  If you have done all of the above, then there will be no losers during the project: you get money to finance your great idea, without losing anything, and buyers get a great product at a low price even before it appears on the market.  (Of course, Kickstarter himself receives a small percentage, but this game is worth the candle).  Of course, provided that the idea was really great and you were able to meet the deadline. <br>  Since all of the above is very difficult for one person to do, we need a team of like-minded people plus some initial capital.  And what if there are no teams of professionals and enthusiasts?  Or create this team, or use someone else's services. <br>  Considering how quickly crowdfunding is gaining momentum, and the amount of collection exceeding a million dollars is not too astounding, it is not surprising that intermediaries began to appear promising to provide all possible assistance and simplify your work for a modest (or not) reward.  I stumbled upon one of such offices recently on the Internet and want to tell about it.  It is called Brikstarter, in the future I will write in Russian - Brikstarter. <br>  <a href="http://brikstarter.com/">brikstarter.com</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ed1/0ed/97a/ed10ed97afbfa8a8cd4963b966b858d4.jpg"><br>  Immediately I warn you that this is not in any way their advertisement.  On the contrary, their activity confuses me a little.  They launched their project back in the summer, but I haven‚Äôt yet noticed a single major success story on their website.  Here's what the project page looks like.  I am not impressed by the abundance of information. <br>  <a href="http://brikstarter.com/three-column/">brikstarter.com/three-column</a> <br><br>  So what do the hot English guys offer us?  I quote. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúWe will provide a full range of services and you can just relax, Brikikstarter will do everything for you, although most still prefer to actively participate in the implementation of the idea, and this is the right position!  Anyway, here is a list of what you get: <br>  Complete design - we will carry out your idea and turn the idea into a completely finished product <br>  CAD models - you will receive CAD models for production and prototyping <br>  3D models - each Kickstarter project must have a 3D model.  Fortunately, we have an Objet 3D printer in our office to create them. <br>  Calculation of funds - we will calculate the amount that you need to collect in order to cover all costs and help set the right goals <br>  Video of your product - the most successful projects on Kickstarter have video support.  And you will have one too. ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  And what will they demand from you in return for their hectic activities? <br>  Only three things: <br>  Initial cash installment.  Its amount is unknown and depends on the complexity of the project and the volume of services provided.  By their claim, it starts with a few hundred pounds.  The upper limit is apparently determined only by their imagination. <br>  Further.  In the event of a successful fundraising, you will have to pay 10 percent of the money received during the Kickstarting fees. <br>  Well, finally, the last "little thing".  It is necessary to give in their management 10 percent of the shares of your company or 10 percent of the output, I hope this is not about the product as a whole, but about the volume that you issue as a reward to the project backers.

    <h4>  Let's sum up. </h4><br>  On the one hand, with small initial investments, the guys promise to spend most of the development for you, to prepare a video and a website, but on the other hand, they will have to pay a considerable price. <br>  If we assume that you are launching a new game on the market, having only an ingenious scenario, these conditions are likely to be attractive.  They will do everything for you, making a virtual copy of the game and sending it by mail or downloading from the server is not worth a penny ... Well, or it is worth a penny, and you are spoiling the big game. <br>  But now suppose that you have a technological project and you have undertaken to make a device.  First you pay them a fee.  Then, about 10 percent will have to restrain Kickstarter and Amazon.  Then 10 percent of the amount of the guys in cash and another 10 percent of ‚Äúgreyhounds puppies‚Äù.  It remains to calculate how much will be spent on logistics and taxes ... And at what price do you actually need to offer the product to the buck so that you yourself will have at least a bottle of good whiskey? <br>  Personally, it reminds me of a good old children's cartoon ‚ÄúTwo of the same box from the face‚Äù, or rather the words of Vovochka, the main character (not to be confused with the eponymous character of today's GREAT policy): ‚ÄúAnd what will you eat for me?‚Äù <br><br>  By the way, whoever didn‚Äôt see the link, you‚Äôll not regret it. <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DUJ84I0iKd_s">www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ84I0iKd_s</a> <br><br>  But the guys from Brikstarter see it completely differently: <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúBrikstarter will help you at every new stage of development of your project.  All you have to do is share your idea, we will do the rest for you.  All this will cost you very cheaply: instead of spending thousands on promoting your project, contact us, we will actually do everything for a pittance.  This results from the fact that we take the tax from rates, instead of advance payment.  Risks and guarantees: since we take most of the risk, your success is our success, so we guarantee 100% success ... otherwise we will be left with nothing. <br>  Like mother goose, we release goslings from the nest and let them fight for their own existence.  We take a ten percent share of the product, but ultimately you are in complete control of the situation.  Thanks to this system, you can start your business virtually from scratch and accomplish everything with minimal costs.  " </blockquote><br>  What do you think, who among us is closer to the truth?  Do such projects have the right to life, what set of services and under what conditions should they ensure that they are popular? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/168917/">https://habr.com/ru/post/168917/</a></p>
