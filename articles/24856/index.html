</pre><br><br>  As you can see from the above excerpt, the lawsuit was filed by Allen, Ern, <br>  venture capitalists and the corporation itself.  We were very puzzled by the form <br>  filing this lawsuit, because the basis of his dispute between two groups of shareholders (VI <br>  against the founders).  Therefore, we did not expect the corporation to have the same <br>  interest in this lawsuit. <br><br>  My conversation with third-party legal adviser ArsDigita, Jay Hachigian (Jay <br>  Hachigian) from the law firm Gunderson shed some light on how it <br>  turned out to be possible.  It looks like Allen ran his hand deeper into his pockets. <br>  corporations and scraped up a quarter of a million dollars to pay for lawyers, <br>  working for venture capitalists.  Jay warned them that it is not very <br>  right approach, but did not listen to him and did just that.  And before us <br>  a miraculous picture was formed in which a group of shareholders is trying to achieve <br>  greater accountability and responsibility from the management team, not particularly <br>  well, in their (shareholders) opinion doing their work.  In response to this, <br>  managers, seeking to avoid this accountability and responsibility, are suing <br>  these same shareholders.  Moreover, all legal fees and attorney fees <br>  made out of the purse of those same shareholders! <br><br>  The essence of the claim was that Gene and I signed a number of agreements on <br>  which have undertaken certain obligations, n.  always vote on <br>  meetings of the Board of Directors as well as representatives of Greylock and General <br>  Atlantic.  The investment agreement of the VI, which we <br>  signed was thicker than the telephone directory of the Yellow Pages of Manhattan <br>  (comment of the translator: if to trust Google, then it is about 6-7 cm).  And obviously <br>  somewhere there, in the depths of this pile of papers contained a clause that the Council <br>  Directors ArsDigita will not change the provisions of the charter without the consent of <br>  IN AND.  But it never said there that the shareholders could not do it.  Greylock and <br>  General Atlantic would like the court to interpret these documents more widely.  If a <br>  memory serves me well, these documents were prepared by Paul Weiss (Paul <br>  Weiss) (paulweiss.com), General Atlantic attorney.  And according to <br>  generally accepted legal norms, this means that this kind of discrepancies <br>  should not be interpreted in their favor ( <em>approx. translator: the</em> idea is that once <br>  the claimant himself prepared the documents, he cannot insist on a broader <br>  interpretation).  Of course, I am not a lawyer and predict another person‚Äôs actions. <br>  In this case, the Delaware judge, hardly anyone will take.  Personally, I would be very <br>  shocked if the court would sentence in favor of greylock and general <br>  Atlantic.  Such a decision would reduce the will and decision of shareholders to zero, <br>  those.  in other words, the decision of the judge would mean that venture capital firms have <br>  total control, as if their investments in us provided them with ordinary voices <br>  shares ( <em>translator's note:</em> as a rule, venture capital firms receive <br>  preferred stock, not ordinary stock.  This gives them the right to ‚Äúfirst piece <br>  pie, as mentioned above, but does not give a real voice, as <br>  shareholder.  Alternatively, a VI can receive ordinary stock, but it‚Äôs definitely <br>  not a controlling or even blocking package.). <br><br>  Here it is a story as it is.  Of course, much of the writing above, rather <br>  all, the results of the claim will not be relevant.  Courts do not usually decide <br>  which group is most capable of making the right decisions.  The court is considering <br>  such questions as ‚ÄúWhat are the rights of the majority of the company's shareholders in the matter <br>  decision making? ‚Äùor‚Äú Can a VI add restrictions to <br>  agreements signed over a year ago and compiled by their own <br>  lawyers? " <br><br>  The process of judicial investigation and collection of testimony will take a couple of months.  Then <br>  will be the court itself, most likely somewhere in June 2001, in the courtroom, in <br>  Delaware.  A judge can make a decision based on just a few documents. <br>  which means that most of the time and money spent during the collection <br>  The readings will be spent empty. <br><br><h2>  Why did I write this </h2><br><br>  As a rule, people try to talk as little as possible during court proceedings. <br>  proceedings.  But I was more and more annoyed by the comments that <br>  did different people regarding this claim.  ArsDigita management was worn around <br>  the building and told everyone that "Philip sued us in court," complete nonsense.  Allen, <br>  who tells everyone that ‚ÄúVI has a very strong, winning position‚Äù (and why then <br>  you had to pay $ 250,000 owned by shareholders to beat a couple <br>  man, if the position is really strong?).  Reporters who showed it <br>  everything is in this light, as if this story of the struggle of egoism and the lust for power.  AT <br>  in a sense, they are right.  Allen, Chip and Peter definitely didn‚Äôt like it, <br>  that they were exposed as fools, whose ignorance cost the company <br>  $ million.  But with respect to Jin and me, this view is incorrect.  We were happy <br>  would be passive shareholders in a profitable company.  But we didn‚Äôt want to be <br>  passive shareholders in a company that is constantly losing profits. <br><br>  There were a number of practical considerations that motivated me to write this <br>  articles.  One of the great sides of Webb is that there is no more <br>  need to repeat the same thing several times.  Every day i get <br>  about 50 letters from photo.net and philip.greenspun.com readers with a variety of <br>  questions.  Several times a week, reporters call or write to me.  Since <br>  Greylock and General Atlantic filed a lawsuit, the usual flow of questions about art <br>  photography or programming has been put down by a flood of lawsuit questions.  If a <br>  If I hadn‚Äôt written this article, I‚Äôd have long earned myself arthritis of the hands <br>  just sending ‚Äúno comments‚Äù 200 times a day. <br><br>  And finally, there are customers who use the ArsDigita Community System, there are <br>  our friends we recruited at ArsDigita.  They all have the right to know <br>  what is happening is not from an article in a 500-word newspaper and not from a corporate <br>  press release.  The birth and development of the company were open to the general public, its <br>  the story was documented in chapter 2 of the book <br>  <a href="http://philip.greenspun.com/books/panda/">Philip and Alex's Guide to Web Publishing</a> .  Those who have found the strength and means <br>  support us in due time have every right to know how this ended <br>  story. <br><br><h4>  Related Links </h4><br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://unicast.org/arsdigita/">http://unicast.org/arsdigita/</a> full text of the claim and documents provided <br>  to the court. </li><li>  Greylock corporate site: <a href="http://www.greylock.com/">http://www.greylock.com/</a> </li><li>  Corporate site of General Atlantic: <a href="http://www.gapartners.com/">http://www.gapartners.com/</a> </li><li>  "Cold House" by Charles Dickens: <a href="">Project Gutenberg</a> |  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0679405682/photonetA/">Amazon</a> |  <a href="http://lib.ru/INPROZ/DIKKENS/d17.txt">lib.ru</a> (added during translation) </li></ul><br><br>  Copyright 2001 Philip Greenspun <br><br><hr><br><br><h2>  Epilogue (from translator) </h2><br><br>  <a href="http://philip.greenspun.com/arsdigita/litigation-story.html">The place</a> where the original of this story was previously available is on Philip's website. <br>  Greenspana, now decorates the text as follows: <br><br><blockquote>  ArsDigita Corporation and Philip Greenspun have amicably settled all of <br>  their disputes to the mutual interests of the parties involved.  As a <br>  result of the settlement, Greenspun has resigned from ArsDigita's Board of <br>  Directors and will exercise no ongoing management or stockholder <br>  control.

Under the terms of this agreement, Greenspan resigned. <br>  from the Board of Directors of ArsDigita and will no longer participate in <br>  management, nor use your shareholder rights.  The company and Greenspan are also <br>  signed a nondisclosure agreement. <br></blockquote><br><br>  The company did not last long after the departure of Philip.  Someone says that many <br>  the problems she encountered were <a href="http://michael.yoon.org/arsdigita">not caused only by the VI</a> , that Philip himself <br>  was far from modesty and humility.  But be that as it may, in my opinion the story <br>  This is very indicative and very useful both to those who ‚Äúwork for the uncle‚Äù and <br>  those who build their business. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/24856/">https://habr.com/ru/post/24856/</a></p>
