      Taking advantage of the fact that PRO, for reasons of economy, I had been paid for 3 months (+ bonus - a month), I decided to see how events would develop further.  Moreover, the money still does not return. <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ab6/73b/1f5/ab673b1f5491a7deca59e4ed2c0641d5.jpg"><br><br><br>  For the purity of the experiment, I looked at the site every day - it gave the same rating growth with active freelancers. <br>  As I already wrote, my level on this site is ‚Äúborderline‚Äù: beginners are behind, only ‚Äúold-timers‚Äù are ahead, who have worked on free-lance for two years or more. <br>  When the notorious event happened (on the night from the second to the third of October, without declaring war), I was in 2323rd place in the ranking. <br>  On the ninth day, 11/10/2012 I was on the 2077th place. <br>  On the fortieth day - already on the 1744th. <br>  That is, the number of ‚Äúold‚Äù freelancers on the site for 40 days decreased by a quarter (by 579). <br>  According to my specialization (article), I ‚Äúclimbed‚Äù from the 50th to the 36th place (28% of old-timers left). <br>  And this is not the limit.  I think that among the ‚Äúold men‚Äù there are many people who are as economical as I, who paid 3 times a year (paid for 4 months) and will not prolong the life of the PRO as useless.  In general, the number of PRO accounts on free-lance.ru has decreased by 40%. <br><br>  Now about the quality and quantity of orders (I estimate subjectively and only according to my specializations - texts and translations).  The total number of orders has decreased at least twice.  And the main mass is now rewriting at a price of 10-15 rubles.  for 1000. If earlier 2-3 orders were published daily, which might interest me, during the last week there were none at all (I was too lazy to look at previous weeks). <br><br>  On the other hand, customers leading an independent (without publishing orders) search for performers even became somewhat more active. <br>  In my profile for 8 months, there is a sign ‚ÄúBusy‚Äù and prices are published very high for my specialization.  However, all this time, about once a month, new customers directly contacted me.  In the last month there were three such customers.  Conclusion: it makes sense to leave the portfolio on the site - for this (for now?) They do not require money. <br><br>  Finally, ‚Äúcount the money in someone else‚Äôs pocket.‚Äù <br>  03/10/12 on free-lance.ru there were 5031 PRO accounts.  Today there are 3066. Almost 2000 less.  Accordingly, the income has decreased over the month at least a million rubles.  In addition, costs have increased.  To look after freelancers, I had to hire additional moderators: <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ceb/4c1/13b/ceb4c113bf05fbe0fe7b11527b1a5e94.jpg"><br><br>  I doubt that it was possible to compensate for the loss by increasing the number of ‚Äútransactions without risk‚Äù.  For those who used this service, the number of orders, I think, has decreased.  And those who did not use, for the most part, opposed such brazen pressure. <br>  Numerous alternatives that were discussed at Habrahabr also played their part in this. <br>  So, if the site owners have not decided to turn it into an advertising platform for a narrow circle of <s>my</s> interested party members, they will have to reanimate.  Otherwise, the once-leading freelance exchange will turn into a non-commercial platform like "Remarkmarket". <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/158203/">https://habr.com/ru/post/158203/</a></p>
