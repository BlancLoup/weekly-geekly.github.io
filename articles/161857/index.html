Few people make their dreams come true, whether they are children's dreams or quite sensible adult desires.  The harsh routine puts everything in its place.  Or not?  Or the problem is not in it, but in the people themselves?  How can a person make his dream come true?  This is what this article will be about. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/27f/493/5b4/27f4935b40f62b2db7c0de77582cf2de.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  Goal and dream </h4><br>  One of the fundamental problems that can eventually lead to a chain of failures is that the goal and the dream can be easily confused.  In fact, sometimes these are completely different concepts.  A goal can be your dream, a dream can be a goal.  But at the same time they may not be identical.  Let me explain with an example: <br>  A friend of mine had a dream, and she represented an image.  The image of how he, at the age of 30, sits in a pathetic Moscow club with a glass of something insanely expensive and examines the surroundings in a businesslike manner.  He could not clearly express what he wanted, but he could convey the range of feelings that he felt, thinking about his dream.  Here and free views of the world, the lack of a serious relationship, material wealth, the desire to have fun and much more.  Dozens of individual goals and just one dream.  Therefore, you should clearly define your goals that can make up your dream. <br><br>  But before you engage in the knowledge of goals, you should know yourself. <br><br><h4>  Self cognition </h4><br>  Each person is individual and no one knows you better than you.  And in order to know yourself, your ability to achieve a particular goal, you need to identify all the strengths and weaknesses of your own personality.  So open a notepad or a text document and start writing right off the points about your pros and cons. <br><br>  The main thing is not to forget about all the factors that make up your positive qualities and feel free to face it when you bring in your weaknesses.  Are you lazy?  Write about it!  It will be a minus.  Do you like sports?  This is already a plus.  Great at playing computer games?  Again this can be an advantage. <br><br>  So, before your eyes there is a list of your pros and cons, determine for yourself which personal traits can help and which ones will interfere.  Based on this, it is necessary to identify in what ways you can achieve your goals, and which ones are better to exclude, since they will be the most difficult for our personality.  As a result, we can form our own methodology for achieving goals, our own motives and priorities.  We know what we can do. <br><br><h4>  Cognition goal </h4><br>  The goal should have several very important criteria, only then it can be implemented, and even more important, only then it will need to be implemented. <br><br>  <b>1. Significance.</b>  The goal that you set yourself should be desired, you must really want it.  Ask yourself the question: ‚ÄúDo I really need this goal?‚Äù.  A friend of mine wanted to move to Canada, later he realized that he did not need the country itself, but the totality of the advantages that this country has - low crime, comfortable living conditions, state support, and after that he changed direction, more simply. The move was a completely different country - Montenegro.  It should also be understood that the goal must be durable.  Make sure that tomorrow it will not cease to be meaningful to you. <br><br>  <b>2. Specificity.</b>  The goal is only then the goal, when it is clearly articulated, otherwise it is a dream.  It is necessary to make the most specific description without the possibility of double interpretation. <br><br>  <b>3. Structured.</b>  The goal itself will not tell you how to achieve it, but a specific action plan may.  It will be necessary to break everything up into stages, identify tasks, and prioritize and prioritize them.  For each task, you also need to add a list of the necessary tools for the execution and describe a specific methodology with which you implement all this.  You should also add the criteria by which you will assess the degree of completion of the task.  This may be a time factor, material and any other.  Suppose the task is to acquire an initial capital of 5 thousand dollars.  It should be clarified that the task will be completed not when you have the money, but when they are not within the scope of your necessary expenses.  That is free money. <br><br>  It seems simple and clear?  But the majority constantly comes on the same rake.  People do not understand the significance of these 3 principles, and this <b>is the main key to success</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/342/23a/898/34223a89854c38fd352d4df5065b32da.jpg"><br><br>  To help people understand these postulates and to facilitate the maintenance of their goals, a project to <a href="https://smartprogress.do/">achieve the goals of SmartProgress</a> was created.  We want to create a community for mutual assistance in various issues, united by the most important topic of our life - achievement of goals. <br><br><h4>  Way to success </h4><br>  Finally, we have all the preparatory stages behind our backs and it‚Äôs time to start realizing our goal.  When the goal in the form of a clear plan is constantly in your head, it will begin to change your everyday life.  There will always be thoughts about how to implement this or that item.  You yourself will notice such metamorphosis after a couple of weeks.  But just follow the plan a little, you need something more. <br><br><h4>  Method development </h4><br>  As you go towards your goal, time will go by.  You will learn new things, gain experience, think more about this whole structure, new interesting thoughts will appear on how to improve problem solving techniques, maybe by setting new ones, which will further simplify and specify the path to the goal.  And all this should be mandatory to record without missing anything.  Forgetting them now means losing the chance to speed up the process of achieving the goal. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a85/88a/95a/a8588a95ab1779ab698aaaabee2b9ed3.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Carrot and stick </h4><br>  Realizing a dream in the form of a goal is akin to freelancing, no one forces it to do, you are your own boss.  Thus, in this process there are all the same realities.  Problems with self-organization, which result in endless "breakfasts."  To minimize such incidents, the good old principle of carrots and sticks is well suited.  Indicate in your diary the possible rewards for the timely execution of the next task or its stage, and any penalties for the delay.  The reward can be a small holiday, maybe an after-school day off or something else, the sanction is additional work. <br><br><h4>  Purpose and goals </h4><br>  Remember where we started the story?  A dream can include several goals.  And if you have several of them, then it is very important to arrange them in order of priority.  You should always know what is more important to you, otherwise there will be confusion and confusion.  In addition, if you have achieved a specific goal, then you can congratulate yourself, and immediately take the next one.  Not a day can not live without a goal, otherwise you can quickly fade and all the enthusiasm will decline.  Therefore, make a plan for the next goal even earlier than the previous one.  Moreover, achieving one goal is the best motivator to take on the next one. <br><br><h4>  Public goal setting </h4><br>  Very often, in various sources it is recommended not only to keep your goal in your head, but also to voice it to others.  These can be friends, relatives or even strangers.  When you tell your goal to others, you subconsciously put it in the execution mode, otherwise those around you will consider windbag.  For many, just such a motivation is stronger than others.  That is why the main specificity of SmartProgress is public target management.  Agree - by communication and exchange of experience it is much faster to achieve results. <br><br>  Not much time has passed since the launch of the project. At the same time, we periodically receive letters from users who write letters of thanks, claiming that the project really helps them.  Some people find motivation, others - partners, and others - investors. <br><br>  Let's achieve our goals together! <br>  Join the <a href="https://smartprogress.do/">SmartProgress</a> service <br><br>  <i>PS If you do not have an account in Habr√©, you can express your opinion on <a href="http://smarttalks.club/ru/dream-or-goal/">this article in our blog - SmartTalks</a></i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/161857/">https://habr.com/ru/post/161857/</a></p>
