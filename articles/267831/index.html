  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About the features of geolocation technology in MDK</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/79b/037/a69/79b037a69c7a4f83b39e73bd63e85ab2.jpg" align="left">  Geofencing, adopted by the developers of MDK, is an integrated warning system when a user crosses a virtual perimeter installed around certain points on a geographic map.  Despite the simple definition, the geofensing technology allows you to implement many unique services that are inaccessible to other technologies using the geographic coordinates of the user.  But that's not all: the geofensing mechanism integrated into MDK is based on a very flexible geoling algorithm with minimal access to GPS navigation.  In practice, this means a significantly more economical battery consumption of smartphones by users of mobile applications based on the MDK platform. <br><br>  The simplified definition of the ‚Äúborder crossing alert‚Äù method hides the enormous possibilities of using geofing technology to analyze data and use it in various applications. <br><br>  Geofensing services integrated into the Messenger Development Kit allow you to flexibly customize the analysis of the received data and control remote processes using predefined parameters.  For example, monitoring of working time or lunch breaks can be configured both in terms of duration and in time of the beginning and end of the process.  Effective data analysis provides for the collection and tracking of a wide variety of information, including ‚Äúwho spends time with whom‚Äù or ‚Äúwho has visited the same place at different times‚Äù. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Geofensing information flows are integrated into the MDK-based business messenger directly at the application context level, which completely eliminates the user from annoying SMS alerts.  Full control over the ongoing processes in real time, accurate information about the state of the equipment and the ability to send pop-up messages in the context of the location significantly save time and nerves of employees and customers.

      Unlike the many GPS applications available today that are tightly tied to GPS information and for this reason quickly discharging a smartphone‚Äôs battery, ContextKit LoMa‚Äôs built-in MDK algorithm for iOS and Android platforms from Tourmaline Labs uses integrated information from geofencing.  The transfer of positioning data is performed as the application is accessed, at specified intervals of time or as it passes (or does not pass) a certain distance. <br><br>  Thus, the frequency of calls to GPS is significantly reduced and, as a result, the discharge rate of batteries decreases.  Another advantage of this technology lies in its high positioning accuracy without being tied to the cloud, even in the absence of a connection, since the ContextKit LoMa algorithm is able to accurately calculate the location in an autonomous mode. <br><br>  An additional advantage of MDK-based business messengers is the ability to create a multi-level application that allows you to configure different conditions for triggering alerts (for example, customer calls or service availability) for different groups, even in a large organization.  Geofensing services that are easy to set up can be defined separately for each remote division of a company, institution or even for each remote user. <br><br>  Using the geofensing API integrated into MDK, you can provide remote parameter settings, set their expiration date or active period, and use information from a large number of geolocations, including those activated by third-party events.  The number of events that generate alerts can also include so-called ‚Äúnegative events‚Äù, that is, in the case of, for example, an unfulfilled meeting, transfer of cargo, documents, etc. In addition, the geofensing services can be associated not only with the user or organization, but also with a specific application. <br><br>  Messenger with the use of geofencing services MDK allows using the web client to provide a visual display of any events, active or inactive, on a diagram or on a map.  The user, in turn, has the ability to control the display of geofensing services, sorting events by type, time, geographical zones, type of applications, user, program or geographical identifiers. <br><br>  Despite globally unlimited sources of geographic information, all information and data in an MDK-based business messenger is always securely encrypted, protected and stored in accordance with industry security standards in the cloud.  Along with robust, highly secure authentication and user identification procedures built into the MDK core, unique scenarios for the use of geofensing services are possible, including even in such demanding areas as payment processing, transfer and receipt of money via Google Wallet or PayPal payment services. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/267831/">https://habr.com/ru/post/267831/</a></p>
