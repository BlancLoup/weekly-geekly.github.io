  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Customers, designers and those between the hammer and the anvil</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I think on Habr√© this has been discussed more than once, but I would like to discuss with you how to protect the work of their designers in front of the customer. <br><br>  Our talented designer, who collaborates with us on all projects, once painted one work.  In my opinion, it is fully consistent with the TZ of the customer. <br>  TK was oral :) The following wish was expressed that an illustration should be made that could be used both in the company's booklet and in gloss.  ‚ÄúOur Vladik‚Äù (hello to him, by the way), did a great job: a photo session was held and a couple of days without sleep.  That's what happened. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cad/167/89a/cad16789addf514dca6196af186131d5.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We personally and all our staff liked everything and the customer as well.  But after it happened a very funny incident for me, we came to defend the booklet which we ourselves did, made up and invented all its content, except for those characteristics of the vehicle.  We‚Äôre sitting with the customer's ‚ÄúVladik‚Äù and showing the whole booklet, and then it started ... :) Guys, let's move this inscription, and yes, we‚Äôll replace this phrase too.  And by the way, this phone number should be written like this! 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

        </script>
      <br>
      At that time, I, as a manager, had little skill in protecting my employees, and all corrections were written in pencil.  After a tough criticism came and for this moment we are very grateful to the customer - we were brought up))) We were shown critical moments in the booklet, after which Vladik freaked out, pushed the table top rollers and pulled the disc out of the drive and jerked them ... I won't correct it.  What do you think the author of the article did?  Of course, he blushed for his employee, apologized and said that he would be right back, and we will fix everything. <br><br>  Having caught up with the author of the booklet on the street, he was explained that in fact in this world, the one who pays is ordered by music.  Taking the disc and returning to the customer, we discussed everything to the end and, of course, fixed everything. <br><br>  Actually, this was the preface.  Having worked in the industry of advertising and people with a creative approach, it is necessary to understand that you are always between the hammer and the anvil, some ask here and so, while others say we ... we don‚Äôt draw and we will not do it categorically. <br><br>  Personally, I concluded that it is always worth defending the rights of your children and their work, and even if the customer had a million reasons not to accept the work, or a million reasons to correct something in it, you should find at least one million five answers and our arguments that we make advertising and we need to listen. <br><br>  What do you think? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/77530/">https://habr.com/ru/post/77530/</a></p>
