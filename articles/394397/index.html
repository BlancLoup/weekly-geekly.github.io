  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Kingston microSD Non Camera Memory Card Review Action Camera UHS-I U3</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>Hi, Giktayms!</b>  Memory cards today have learned everything: quickly copy files, without delay, record video in 4K format and hold tens of gigabytes on a piece of plastic the size of a finger pad.  The only thing that they can‚Äôt do for now is protection against various force majeure.  However, this applies to almost any technology.  But sometimes the data from the card is much more important than a damaged camera or drone.  For such purposes, Kingston introduced the <a href="http://www.kingston.com/ru/flash/microsd_cards/sdcac">microSD Action Camera UHS-I U3</a> card, one of the few cards that can survive almost anything. <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/kingston_technology/blog/276078/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b50/6d2/bde/b506d2bde12f4fc4a7522c7d9a77b2ed.jpg"><br></a> <a name="habracut"></a><br>  By "anything" we do not mean a banal fall into a puddle or a strong shake-up from off-road driving.  Recently, a professional fighter pilot Arthur Sargsyan tested the <b>Kingston microSD Action Camera UHS-I U3 card</b> in an action camera mounted on an airplane wing.  Neither steep turns with exorbitant overloads, nor a sharp change in temperature, nor a strong vibration affected its performance.  The output was an impressive movie. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/4C6WK3CavxY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjdh6t3QXD52xNPCbCI0vWuhZlPwA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

      However, scenarios for using action cameras and memory cards for them can be very different. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/705/3e8/877/7053e887739647f7a0d815a2f75969d9.jpeg"><br><br>  The name of the card is very long, but it immediately reflects the essence: what it is, why you need it, and what characteristics the customer should count on.  First, the company used the microSD format.  It is available in almost all smartphones, as well as many camcorders, including the most popular among outdoor enthusiasts - GoPro.  Secondly, the card meets the standard UHS-I U3.  The abbreviation guarantees a minimum write speed of 30 MB / s.  In practice, the speed should be higher - the manufacturer claims 45 MB / s write and twice the reading speed (90 MB / s). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b39/917/dae/b39917dae59346428525f759e8fe8e7f.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, until recently U3 was an advanced class, until the categories V60 and V90 were introduced (we told about this <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/kingston_technology/blog/274966/">in a separate post</a> ).  Such characteristics allow you to easily shoot in Full HD and 4K, while taking photos in parallel.  These formats require large volumes - the source code turns out to be ‚Äúweighty‚Äù.  Kingston offers cards from 16 to 64 gigabytes, which will be enough to save all the moments. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/016/3a1/425/0163a1425b674cd79a0e0c520a978d09.jpg"><br><br>  According to the test results, the reading speed and the writing speed were even slightly higher than those stated.  Let me remind you, we use the Crystal Disk Mark package and the <b>Kingston FCR-HS4 USB3.0</b> card reader.  The read speed was almost 93 MB / s, and the write speed was almost 69 MB / s.  Great results. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/741/cb8/2a4/741cb82a425d48d99fd7022a2dc788c8.jpg"><br><br>  But the main thing in the <b>Kingston microSD Action Camera UHS-I U3</b> is not even impressive speed, but the card's protection from external influences.  When shooting dynamic events - snowboarding, water skiing, parachuting, kayaking - there is a high risk of damage to the equipment.  Whatever the reliable attachment of the GoPro, in certain situations they can still break.  You are lucky if you can immediately notice this and pick up the fallen camera.  And if, let's say, you didn‚Äôt see it while skiing down the mountain and are you going to look for a camera?  Low temperatures do not promise anything good.  And it is very opportune that the card from Kingston maintains a working capacity in the range of -25 to +85 degrees Celsius.  The lower level of storage temperature is -40 degrees Celsius.  Left in the hot sun, the GoPro warms up like a frying pan, but it doesn't hurt a flash drive.  The same with the camera fallen in snow or ice water. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/32d/833/62e/32d83362edc7404aa3710554859dbbfc.jpg"><br><br>  Or they can take shots from a quadcopter - everyone has good devices: they have learned to fly high and far, they are able to lift even heavy equipment.  But problem one is not solved - quadrocopters tend to fall, even if initially the flight goes smoothly.  Now it will catch on the branches or trees, then it will fall under the strong wind, then something will go wrong when returning to the starting point.  A small incident will take the drone completely, unlike a camera with a flash drive inside.  As a rule, the compartments for cards are protected by seals, but the lid may open from falling.  Or the drone will fall over the water and lie there for some time while you search for it.  It is one thing to be waterproof when washing the chamber from dirt with tap water, and another is the equipment lying in the lake.  Protection against moisture would not hurt at all all the cards, not just the "extreme": it is not necessary to immerse the flash drive in water to spoil it.  Even the usual replacement card in the rain can harm it.  With the microSD Action Camera UHS-I U3, such a scenario is excluded. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/372/1fd/943/3721fd943e8246d087f1982d6f3277ee.jpg"><br>  <i>Drone hit by a monkey.</i>  <i>The device must have suffered, but nothing threatens the recordings.</i> <br><br>  Standard protection of the camera in such cases is not enough, and the solution from Kingston will add safety to your videos with valuable moments.  In addition to the waterproof microSD Action Camera UHS-I U3, there are other advantages: X-ray protection, vibration resistance and resistance to shocks.  The fall of the drone from a height of a couple of tens of meters into the pond will not affect the safety of your videos.  It will only be necessary to find the camera itself. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z4EE7Vv_RdM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgP67g-XZ-xtufQFbpi0lHK5hmTDg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>Quadcopter life is short, but many memories remain</i> <br><br>  A secure memory card is a must-have for fans of not only an active lifestyle, but also shooting extreme videos.  Some records are obtained without exaggeration unique, to lose them because of the memory card will be incredibly insulting.  Kingston promises excellent protection against any adversity - you really need to try to break such a flash drive. <br><br>  Thank you for your attention and stay with <b>Kingston</b> on Hiktatimes! <br><br>  For more information about Kingston and HyperX products, visit <a href="http://www.kingston.com/ru">the company's official website</a> .
