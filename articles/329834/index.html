He himself is frustrating - you see a huge number of pain points, each of which drives into anguish.  I want to fix everything at once, but resources may be limited, and the current inefficient processes and narrow worldview in terms of design will not allow many of the troubles to be solved once and for all.  And the value of any change at the current stage of the company's development is different - there is no point in increasing the overall design culture, if the designers themselves work anyhow.

      <em>Article written for the magazine UXmatters.</em> <br><br><h2>  Organization redesign </h2><br>  The UX-strategy should improve the company's products through changes in the organization that produces these products.  It is not enough to accomplish the feat in the form of a successful redesign of an outdated service - you need to ensure the repeatability of good results. <br><br>  The task of design leaders is to find this path to a brighter future and to lead a company on it.  What is a systematic approach to solving problems in general: <br><br><ol><li>  Describe the current interface and organizational debt that make it difficult to create quality products. </li><li>  Show the vision of the future - how you see the perfect design of the company's products and what should be earned for this. </li><li>  To point out what the current problems are hindering in the product and what exactly will improve the changes.  This will show their value to the company and the products. </li><li>  Assess the complexity of the changes - what needs to be done within the design team and in the organization as a whole, for a bright future to come. </li><li>  Determine the stages of implementation of changes - priority, medium and long-term. </li><li>  Start to include changes in the overall work plan and track their accomplishment and talk extensively about positive changes. </li></ol><br>  As you progress, several nice things will happen.  It will become easier to work - process problems will be fixed and credibility will increase.  The overall design level in the company will grow - in terms of basic quality, and in terms of opportunities to do strong things in the future.  Well, since the appetite comes with eating, then the planning horizon for changes in design will expand and you will want to move forward even further. <br><br><h3>  Difficult to start perfectly </h3><br>  Ideally, you need to go not only from ideas for fixing the design, but from business problems - to go over them, and then propose specific implementations and improvements that will give maximum exhaust.  But in the early stages of changes in organizational problems there are so many that half of the proposed ideas will definitely fall into the problem of business and will be mandatory for implementation.  And in general, at the start, you rather just need to survive, proving your worth. <br><br>  When I came to Mail.Ru Group in the middle of 2011, my colleague Alexey Sergeev had already managed to prove to the top management the importance of good design.  In his efforts for a couple of years, the first design team in the division appeared, usability testing began, several key products were updated.  My task was to scale up success with a new team, and Aleksey left to deal with the product strategy. <br><br>  However, in fact, it turned out that, although the importance of good design and proven by top managers, not all product managers imbued with it.  On the whole, at the middle level of management and among the final executors, it is necessary to build confidence in the designers.  I did not immediately realize this.  Coming, I boasted that we set up the workflow for a month and then everything will go like clockwork.  But there were always some trifles that were destroying clear work processes, delaying tasks, breaking plans, etc. <br><br>  As a result, the first six months were the most difficult.  Expectations on both sides did not all fall into reality and there was a feeling that we would soon be ‚Äúasked‚Äù.  I have seen a lot of failures in changing the design in other companies and the first six months is a critical point, after which either everything is getting better, or everyone diverges.  On the other hand, during this time I understood in detail what exactly hinders us inside and outside the team and described the plan for dealing with these pain points.  I thought that I would have to defend and prove it, but suddenly it turned out that everything was for nothing, and I just had to act. <br><br>  Several years have passed since then and we made a mini-revolution in what Mail.Ru can be.  At first, the pace was not very fast, but as basic problems were solved, the team and processes were built, knowledge accumulated and the authority of designers increased, and there were more and more positive changes in products.  I regularly sum up the year and can be traced back to the changes: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/502273249/posts/10154435703623250/">2016</a> : 44 launch and redesign </li><li>  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jvetrau/posts/10153511880088250">2015</a> : 31 </li><li>  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jvetrau/posts/10152734427538250">2014</a> : 42 </li><li>  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jvetrau/posts/10151967203663250">2013</a> : 50 </li><li>  <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/jvetrau/user-experience-2012-mailru">2012</a> : 28 </li><li>  <a href="http://www.jvetrau.com/techforummailru-2011/">2011</a> </li></ul><br>  Now there are 14 people in the team responsible for approximately 20 products - productivity (Mail, Cloud, Calendar, Mail.Ru for business), media projects (Auto, Horoscopes, Children, Welcome, Health, Lady, Cinema, Mediator, Real Estate, News , Answers, Weather, Sport, TV, Hi-Tech, SEOSan), mobile products (Beepcar, Artisto), the main page and general portal rules for Mail.Ru and My.com.  Compared to what was six years ago, this is quite a lot, but if you look at the number of tasks, the load is huge.  That is why we drown for any ways to automate the process - design systems, algorithms, removing unnecessary work steps, etc.  Restrictions move design ideas and we have learned how to work with them. <br><br><h4>  Mobile applications </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/212/7f0/20b/2127f020b08b48f22fd2472535c815da.png" alt="Mobile applications now: Mail My.com and Mail.Ru, News, Cloud, Horoscopes, Beepcar and others.

But get there. <br><br>  Although I want to part with the past one decisive restart, in fact it is not always possible and extremely risky - full of stories of hasty jerks when the redesign ruined the product and repelled users.  Therefore, it is better to first make hell adequate;  from adekvat - to make something modern and trend;  and after that you can already think about how to set trends yourself.  Moreover, in addition to updating products, invisible work on updating the organizational structure and production process is required - it is important to simply learn to produce a good result regularly, on stream, and not once every few years during the next redesign.  Yes, a revolution is often needed to start a design change, but after that it develops in an evolutionary way.  This experience of restructuring processes and products formed the basis of a series of articles on UX-strategy. <br><br><h2>  Design Management Patterns </h2><br>  We started the changes in the company at a time when the concept of ‚Äú <a href="http://www.jvetrau.com/uxstrategy-2/">product designer</a> ‚Äù with broad responsibility was not yet formed, and there was not much material on the UX-strategy and design management of digital products.  But the bumps stuffed by us and other companies should simplify life. <br><br>  I have compiled a checklist of improvements that will help start or accelerate changes in your company.  It is based on our path and observation of change histories in other companies.  Improvements will descend from business problems to specific recipes for design managers: business value ‚Üí solution ‚Üí pattern.  Patterns are tied to maturity levels (O is operational, T is tactical, C is strategic). <br><br><h3>  0. Awareness of the value of design </h3><br>  <strong>Value for business</strong> : Zero phase of change - how to show business that design benefits. <br><br>  <strong>Evaluation Criteria</strong> : <br><br><ul><li>  Trust managers.  They come with a problem, not a ready-made solution. </li><li>  Trust the end experts.  Directly seek solutions for working problems, bypassing managers. </li><li>  Tasks come in advance, there is time to think through the interface. </li><li>  The number of iterations on tasks decreases. </li></ul><br><h4>  Symptoms symptoms </h4><br>  <strong>Product</strong> : <br><br><ul><li>  Weak or even harmful design solutions. </li><li>  Different screens of the same product look and work differently. </li></ul><br>  <strong>Organization</strong> : <br><br><ul><li>  Designers have no influence on product solutions. </li><li>  Designers are attracted to the tasks at the last moment, "to induce marafet." </li><li>  Managers and developers themselves make design decisions. </li></ul><br><h4>  Solution ‚Üí pattern </h4><br>  Deliver the basics of good design: <br><ul><li>  <strong>A</strong> : Design leader (part 4) </li><li>  <strong>A</strong> : Argumentation, presentation and facilitation skills </li><li>  <strong>T</strong> : Trust (part 1) </li><li>  <strong>T</strong> : Map of decision makers </li><li>  <strong>C</strong> : Co-design (part 4) </li><li>  <strong>C</strong> : General Design Literacy (Part 4) </li><li>  <strong>S</strong> : Lawyer design among top managers </li></ul><br>  Clearly show the problem: <br><ul><li>  <strong>T</strong> : Usability testing, which runs the entire product team (part 5) </li><li>  <strong>T</strong> : Analytics and experiments (part 5) </li></ul><br>  Show the benefits of design in practice: <br><ul><li>  <strong>A</strong> : Quick wins (part 6) </li><li>  <strong>T</strong> : Internal marketing design success. </li><li>  <strong>C</strong> : Business-related design metrics (part 5) </li></ul><br><br><h3>  1. Product quality </h3><br>  <strong>Value for business</strong> : Increase the quality of the product to increase its value to users and reduce support costs. <br><br>  <strong>Evaluation Criteria</strong> : <br><ul><li>  Worthy quality of the product in the implementation, not only layouts. </li><li>  Better attitude of users to the product, which is reflected in the growth of key metrics. </li><li>  Fewer resources to maintain an acceptable level of quality. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Symptoms symptoms </h4><br>  <strong>Product</strong> : <br><ul><li>  The interface visually collapsed. </li><li>  Do not work out some functions. </li><li>  Some functions are incomprehensible, the user cannot work with them. </li><li>  Purchased or just launched product is worse than the rest. </li></ul><br>  <strong>Organization</strong> : <br><ul><li>  Developers inattentively implement layouts. </li><li>  The design is issued ahead of time, until the implementation quality is checked. </li><li>  Designers give out not fully thought out or incomplete layouts, so developers have to think out themselves (and they are not experts). </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Solution ‚Üí pattern </h4><br>  Quality control at the layout level: <br><ul><li>  <strong>A</strong> : Responsibility is broader than just creating mockups (part 2) </li><li>  <strong>A</strong> : T-shaped specialists (part 2) </li><li>  <strong>A</strong> : Map of skills and their development (part 4) </li><li>  <strong>A</strong> : Design Review team (part 4) </li><li>  <strong></strong> : General tools (part 4) </li><li>  <strong>T</strong> : Creative problem-solving techniques (part 4, 5) </li></ul><br>  Quality control at the implementation level: <br><ul><li>  <strong>T</strong> : Design system (part 3) </li><li>  <strong>T</strong> : Check lists </li><li>  <strong>T</strong> : Expert evaluation with the ability to delay the release </li><li>  <strong>T</strong> : Usability Testing (Part 5) </li><li>  <strong>T</strong> : Reducing Interface Debt (Part 6) </li><li>  <strong>C</strong> : Impact on the grocery plan (part 5) </li><li>  <strong>C</strong> : Increasing the overall design culture and developer care (part 4) </li></ul><br>  Quality control at the product and company level: <br><ul><li>  <strong>C</strong> : Long-term planning (part 4, 6) </li><li>  <strong>S</strong> : Design Leaders Club (part 4) </li><li>  <strong>C</strong> : Business-related design metrics (part 5) </li></ul><br><br><h3>  2.

The next task is to assess changes in business value and implementation complexity.  And after that - plan the stages of change implementation. <br><br><h3>  0. Company portrait </h3><br>  In the first part of the series I described the <a href="http://www.jvetrau.com/uxstrategy-1/">‚Äúportrait‚Äù of the company</a> , which is important for the design manager to understand.  Resources, processes and priorities are the three key components that influence the current state of the organization and its future.  This is the environment in which UX will evolve and its features are crucial to the success of the implementation of the UX strategy.  In order to implement it, you need to deeply understand the company's business.  Most organizations have their own characteristics, so although the goals of UX implementation are similar or identical for most, the implementation of the strategy is almost always unique in details. <br><br>  <strong>Resources</strong> : <br><ul><li>  <strong>Money</strong> : How budgeting works (how many designers can you hire, is there a budget for user research, is there a budget for outsourcing). </li><li>  <strong>People</strong> : The ratio of designers and developers (the optimal numbers to strive for). </li><li>  <strong>Time</strong> : At what point in the product development process are designers involved. </li><li>  <strong>Credibility</strong> : Who has already sold the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa good design (top management, product managers, final specialists (developers / testers / marketers)). </li></ul><br>  <strong>Processes</strong> : <br><ul><li>  <strong>Initiation of products and their new features</strong> : What are the levels of leadership, on the basis of what information (analytics / research), how the requirements go to the designers, how success is determined. </li><li>  <strong>Design and development</strong> : Team structure, process, management. </li><li>  <strong>Quality Assurance</strong> : Methods, what is an acceptable level. </li><li>  <strong>Product Distribution</strong> : Channels, their effectiveness and cost per user. </li><li>  <strong>User Support</strong> : Channels, Satisfaction and CES (Customer Effort Score). </li></ul><br>  <strong>Priorities</strong> : <br><ul><li>  <strong>Product Type</strong> : Market (B2B, B2C or other), platform (website, application or other). </li><li>  <strong>Business Model</strong> : Key metrics and how to optimize them. </li><li>  <strong>Stage of the life cycle of the company and product</strong> : <br><ol><li>  Search for a suitable market, product solution and business model for its monetization. </li><li>  User base growth and / or profits. </li><li>  User retention. </li><li>  Efficiency of doing business. </li><li>  Product withdrawal from crisis, when the user base falls, profits or market share - all at once or some of them. </li></ol></li></ul><br><h3>  1. The value of design for business </h3><br>  Understanding what tasks the company faces at the current stage of its development, it is necessary to rank the values ‚Äã‚Äãof design for business.  We take them from the pattern catalog and rate them critically / tolerantly / unimportant.  This should be done regularly - the company and its products are developing and their tasks change.  As Michael Porter said, the essence of the strategy is to determine what not to do. <br><br>  <strong>For example</strong> : <br><table><thead><tr><th>  Value </th><th>  now </th><th>  in a year </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>  <em>Product quality</em> </td><td>  tolerated </td><td>  <strong>is critical</strong> </td></tr><tr><td>  <strong>Market entry speed</strong> </td><td>  <strong>is critical</strong> </td><td>  tolerated </td></tr><tr><td>  Reduced risk when entering the market </td><td>  tolerated </td><td>  tolerated </td></tr><tr><td>  <strong>Increase audience and product profit</strong> </td><td>  <strong>is critical</strong> </td><td>  tolerated </td></tr><tr><td>  Brand enhancement </td><td>  no matter </td><td>  <strong>tolerated</strong> </td></tr><tr><td>  Hiring and developing designers </td><td>  tolerated </td><td>  tolerated </td></tr><tr><td>  Awareness of the value of design </td><td>  tolerated </td><td>  tolerated </td></tr></tbody></table><br><h3>  2. Interface and organizational debt </h3><br>  Now you need to describe the interface and organizational debt.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The first will show problems in the product, the second - in the organization that creates this product. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For this, checklists and heuristics work well. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To evaluate the interface debt, a </font></font><a href="http://uxpamagazine.org/ux-debt-in-the-enterprise/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">chic template from the Kimberly Dunwoody and the Susan Teague Rector</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> or ready-made checklists like </font></font><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">10 Jacob Nielsen heuristics will work</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For organizational evaluation - the design management patterns described above. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">By the way, in my concept, interface debt is in itself an organizational pattern. </font></font><br><br> <strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Organizational duty</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> : </font></font><br> <strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> :</font></font><br><table><thead><tr><th><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Problem or idea </font></font></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> General Design Literacy: Training for Managers and Developers </font></font></td></tr><tr><td><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Media kit for advertising formats </font></font></td></tr><tr><td><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Describe the interface debt </font></font></td></tr><tr><td><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Trend Knowledge Base </font></font></td></tr><tr><td><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Designer's participation in product planning </font></font></td></tr><tr><td><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Hackathon format </font></font></td></tr><tr><td><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> File naming </font></font></td></tr><tr><td><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> SVG Icon Generator </font></font></td></tr><tr><td><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Benchmarks: Our products and competitors </font></font></td></tr></tbody></table><br> <strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Interface debt</font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> :</font></font><br><table><thead><tr><th><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Problem or idea </font></font></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Redo the warning about the region </font></font></td></tr><tr><td><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Move sharing from left column </font></font></td></tr><tr><td><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Replace the news belt with a more capacious and simple one. </font></font></td></tr><tr><td><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Optimize the motion picture footage on the main </font></font></td></tr><tr><td><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Remove news from browsing history </font></font></td></tr><tr><td><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Improved interface texts </font></font></td></tr><tr><td><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Exchange belt out of place </font></font></td></tr><tr><td><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Pull the film block to the end </font></font></td></tr><tr><td><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Remove ALL CAPS </font></font></td></tr></tbody></table><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> After passing the checklists, you will see problems that will need to be solved by the design team. </font></font><br><br><h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 3.

Rosa Wu and Jess McMullin describe their <a href="https://nataliehanson.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/investing-in-design.pdf">approach to change, consisting of three stages</a> : <br><br><ol><li>  <strong>Find partners among top management</strong> , and then show them the value of design.  They will become sponsors and design evangelists in the company. </li><li>  <strong>Launch a pilot project</strong> that will give quick wins and show the value of the design in practice with minimal risk. </li><li>  <strong>Broadly tell about success</strong> , so that all products and divisions of the company also see the value of design in practice. </li></ol><br>  Well, then the process goes in a circle - to evaluate the success of the pilot, launch a new one and tell you more about success.  This will help find like-minded people and new projects for improvements. <br><br><h4>  Salesforce V2MOM </h4><br>  The head of Salesforce Marc Benioff created the company's <a href="https://medium.com/salesforce-ux/making-remote-work-b2e2fe53221f">V2MOM methodology</a> for determining future plans.  Each department and employee writes them, so that the result is a complete chain of management from the main business goals to specific actions, linking all the parts of the strategy together: <br><br><ul><li>  <strong>Vision</strong> - What do you want to achieve? </li><li>  <strong>Values</strong> - What is important about this goal? </li><li>  <strong>Methods</strong> (Methods) - How to achieve it? </li><li>  Obstacles - What can prevent? </li><li>  <strong>Metrics</strong> (Measures) - How to determine that the goal is achieved? </li></ul><br>  The general idea is very similar to OKR in its entirety. <br><br><h4>  Toyota Kata and Kaizen </h4><br>  Japanese management practices have been in great demand in recent decades due to a mixture of simplicity and methodicalness.  Toyota uses the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Kata">4-step Kata approach</a> to move from the current situation to the future: <br><br><ol><li>  Understanding the vision of the future or the general direction of change ... </li><li>  Rate the current situation. </li><li>  Determine the following target situation. </li><li>  Iteratively move in the direction of the new state, which allows you to gradually find and solve previously unknown obstacles. </li></ol><br>  Bosch's Darren Hood at the UX Strategies Summit 2015 talked about <a href="http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2015/08/ux-strategies-summit-2015-review-part-2-day-1-of-the-general-summit.php">how to use Kaizen to change the company's design</a> .  This, again, is a set of continuous small improvements, each of which increases user value or reduces company costs.  And on all fronts, not only within the framework of the product itself - training and motivation of employees, relationships with users, etc. <br><br><h3>  Cases </h3><br>  Although more and more companies are gaining momentum in terms of rethinking and systematizing the design, there are not many bright reference cases.  I will give a number of characteristic examples. <br><br><h4>  Accenture and Fjord </h4><br>  In 2013, a large consulting company Accenture bought the well-known design agency Fjord.  <a href="http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2017/04/review-ux-and-digital-design-week-2016.php">Celia Romaniuk, the head of the studio's London office, says</a> that Accenture's CEO was the protagonist of the studio and the design in general, so he gave a place at the decision-making table and strongly supported, although he did not fully understand the designers themselves.  At the same time, the head of Celia in Accenture told her that the company is full of good and bad people, so you have to stick to the first and not think about the second, then everything will turn out.  As a result, Fjord became a catalyst for changes in the company, because it clearly showed what could be done, so other divisions gradually began to penetrate.  At the same time, they selectively introduce things common for Accenture to preserve the original Fjord culture - they do not use the grade system, they have separate marketing and other activities, although they try to integrate to the maximum.  It is important to pay attention to the design management and the value it brings.  As a result, people become more educated in design and overall design helps a lot in organizational change. <br><br> <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/advertising-week/time-to-re-think-design-t_b_12455924.html"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/285/c12/00d/285c1200d919d1e29b7870996b300ed7.jpg" alt="Fjord design scaling rule" width="780" height="583"></a> <br>  Fjord design scaling rule <br><br>  They now use this integration experience in client projects ‚Äî for example, for their customer Commerzbank, the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/advertising-week/time-to-re-think-design-t_b_12455924.html">design agency bought was a similar catalyst for change</a> , changing the bank from the inside. <br><br><h4>  Citrix </h4><br>  The company has <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/3055502/how-to-tackle-the-ultimate-ux-challenge-modernizing-old-systems">created the role of vice president of product design and has begun a change from pilot projects</a> .  Instead of imposing the need to redesign all departments at once (not everyone understood the value of design), they worked in turn with everyone who was ready himself.  The results of the first pilot were so successful that the rest of the products also wanted to work with sensible designers.  They gained credibility through this example and have since worked closely with cross-functional teams to achieve critical business goals.  As Julie Baher says, <a href="http://thisisdesignthinking.net/2015/02/julie-baher-on-design-thinking-at-citrix/">your task is to change the company's operating system</a> . <br><br><h4>  Coca cola </h4><br>  <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405872615300265">Coca-Cola's David Butler studied the principles of other companies</a> that learned how to use design to solve strategic problems.  He began working in a team of branding and communications, then moved to packaging and equipment, then to retail sales, and at the end - business operations, including distribution and supply.  Although he spends a lot of time on professional design development, he does not use words like ‚Äúdesign thinking‚Äù when communicating with business, but tries to speak their language - all initiatives must increase sales. <br><br><h4>  Eventbrite </h4><br>  Brian Beaver from Eventbrite tells <a href="https://designerfund.com/bridge/how-to-communicate-the-roi-of-design/">how the design team was able to convince management to allocate resources to create a design system</a> .  Together with marketers and financiers, they figured out how much it would cost the company to launch functions with the current set of technologies and how much more profitable and fast the new approach would become. <br><br><h4>  Ford </h4><br>  Explanatory story Parrish Hanna, head of ergonomics and user interaction Ford, about <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/3057494/fords-quest-to-remake-itself-into-a-master-of-ux">how the company is changing itself</a> .  One of the key points was the linking of the UX improvement to the company's mission - ‚Äúmaking people‚Äôs lives better‚Äù. <br><br><h4>  Google </h4><br>  The first attempt to put the product line in order in 2007 failed, but when the founder of Larry Page became the head of the company in 2011, he made a <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/3046512/how-google-finally-got-design">quality UX one of the key tasks</a> .  The leader of the changes from the design itself was Matias Duarte, head of Android design.  He sensibly considered that the centralization of design in a company with so many products was impossible and brought together a small working group of UXA.  After they found a strong visual-interface concept, this team worked with product-specific designers to implement it.  Now the connection between the team of the visual language and the products works in both directions - the designers in the margins bring fresh patterns and solutions to the common pot.  And Matias acts as an evangelist of combining the efforts of different teams under a unified design vision - this was largely helped by his close interaction with Larry Page and his ability to convey ideas to top management. <br><br><h4>  Ibm </h4><br>  The head of IBM <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/15/business/ibms-design-centered-strategy-to-set-free-the-squares.html%3F_r%3D0">Virginia Rometty saw</a> that the corporate software market is changing - instead of complex implementations for the entire company, where the decision is often taken by the IT procurement department, more often specific functional departments pay for subscription to a suitable service, and they are more demanding on the quality of the product (including usability) .  The head of a recently purchased startup Phil Gilbert, who was an evangelist of good design, was offered to scale his best practices to the entire company.  He announced a rather ambitious goal - to hire and train 1000 designers - but did not expect it to be real.  But he received not only good, but also an unexpected question: how quickly can this plan be implemented? <br><br>  In total, the company has 400,000 employees and the centralization of expertise is impossible in practice.  A bet was made on the laboratory incubator in Austin (Texas), which is engaged in the development of typical processes, visual language, training.  As a result, the main goal is to increase the overall design culture in the company, to ‚Äúsell‚Äù the value of design to management at various levels, to hold working sessions and master classes for the transfer of knowledge and experience.  One of the tools for this is mentoring. <br><br><h4>  Intuit </h4><br>  <a href="https://hbr.org/2011/06/the-innovation-catalysts">Serious attention to users in the company began to be paid in 2004</a> with the introduction of NPS.  But by 2007 the growth rate slowed down - the number of critics was reduced, but evangelicals did not appear.  The founder of Intuit Scott Cook gave a 5-hour lecture on the benefits of design for company managers, but didn‚Äôt touch them much.  But Alex Kazaks, who spoke after him, held a small master class on problem solving with the help of a design that ‚Äúhooked‚Äù on almost everyone.  This prompted Kaaren Hanson to be responsible for spreading best practices throughout the company and Intuit launched a ‚Äúinnovation catalysts‚Äù program that helped product teams improve UX and then do it themselves.  The number of "catalysts" has since grown, largely due to the goal - to try to do at least 3-4 projects per year with a clear exhaust. <br><br><h4>  Pepsico </h4><br>  <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/08/pepsicos-chief-design-officer-on-creating-an-organization-where-design-can-thrive">PepsiCo's Mauro Porcini considers the</a> key components of design success in a company to be a strong design leader who is able to integrate different components into a coherent picture (brand, industrial design, interior, UX, innovations), as well as support from top management and confirmation of the design team‚Äôs success. and from the side.  Quick wins will help start the journey through the five stages of design maturity. <br><br>  The head of the company <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/09/how-indra-nooyi-turned-design-thinking-into-strategy">Indra Nooyi praises his approach</a> .  One of the first steps to change was the task for the company's management: to photograph the design examples that they consider good.  Albums brought only a couple of people - the rest asked for their wives or did nothing at all.  This showed that they do not understand what design is.  Since then, much has changed and the company, for example, clearly sees the connection between design and innovation - the latter brought the company 9% of profit in 2014.  In order to systematically engage in innovations, it was necessary, among other things, to rebuild the culture and to treat the failures and fast product creation cycles more easily.  Indra is sure that if before companies needed to reinvent themselves every 10 years, now the speed has increased and this should happen every 2-3 years. <br><br><h4>  Samsung </h4><br>  In the second half of the 90s, Samsung‚Äôs vice president of design strategy, <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/09/how-samsung-became-a-design-powerhouse">An Yong-Il, suggested that companies</a> move away from the practice of making cheap copies of competing products with a new design philosophy.  He did not meet with broad support, and after the Asian financial crisis of 1997, the company cut back on investment in design.  An wanted to leave, but his boss offered him serious training in management and organizational planning.  In 2000, the Corporate Design Center was created, which is responsible for the vision of the future and its implementation in different departments.  And although the company is still periodically criticized for copying, a significant amount of its products are more than worthy. <br><br> <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/09/how-samsung-became-a-design-powerhouse"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d09/d74/b7e/d09d74b7ebef157cd054241beb2da968.png" alt="How Samsung determines the future of its product design" width="780" height="532"></a> <br>  How Samsung determines the future of its product design <br><br><h4>  SAP </h4><br>  Although over the years the company has accumulated a very heavy legacy of complex and inconvenient corporate systems, SAP invests a lot of resources in restructuring the company.  <a href="https://medium.com/sap-design/sap-design-wins-big-in-2016-f6d11c000b36">Chronology of key initiatives</a> : <br><br> <a href="https://medium.com/sap-design/sap-design-wins-big-in-2016-f6d11c000b36"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/68d/3cd/6ed/68d3cd6ed2990ad3ea4cda0e2c9b8de8.png" alt="Chronology of SAP design change initiatives" width="780" height="827"></a> <br>  Chronology of SAP design change initiatives <br><br><h2>  Total </h2><br>  In this series of articles, I described how companies are becoming more mature in terms of design, revealed the main points of focus for a design manager (hiring the right designers, creating a design system, building a design culture, competently setting goals), and also suggested checking sheet that allows you to embed it all.  I hope that thanks to this you can change your company. <br><br>  For me, this series was not only a presentation and structuring of thoughts, but also an opportunity to think about the future of design in the Mail.Ru Group portal team.  Each article described approximately the middle of the way - where we are now and where we are going.  A kind of public commitment that additionally encourages movement forward. <br><br>  One of the main thoughts that I want to additionally mention at the end is that the designers themselves must initiate changes in the company.  No one will take you by the hand, put you at the decision-making table and say: ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a plan, it remains only to realize it‚Äù.  You are hired so that you are more experienced and far-sighted than anyone else in your business, and they themselves show where the problems are and how to solve them.  And after that - gritting his teeth went through all the difficulties and hardships.  Change your attitude to change and just take action: <br><br><ul><li>  Consider improvements in design in terms of business value. </li><li>  Describe the interface and organizational debt - this is the first step to recovery. </li><li>  Changes in the process are non-food tasks.  They need to be able to push through the plan. </li><li>  Be the designers of not only products, but also organizations, as well as the role of design in it. </li></ul><br>  And most importantly - play "in the long."  Design change in a company is a task for several years, not months.  It affects not only the products and their visual component, but also the organization itself, its world view and culture.  Think of your task as a <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S240587261530037X">restructuring of the socio-technical system</a> , rather than just updating multiple screens.  After all, the cause of bad products is a bad machine that produces them, so you first need to repair it. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/https://translate" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  PS Thanks to Kristine Sonne Berg, Sam de Jongh Hepworth and Katrine Hansted from the <a href="https://systematic.com/">Systematic</a> UX team who helped transform the raw checklist idea based on my idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmaturity into a more or less holistic approach. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/329834/">https://habr.com/ru/post/329834/</a></p>
