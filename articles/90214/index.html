Maybe something is wrong with me?  Why doesn't it turn me on? <br><br>  So it was while watching the presentation, and while reading other people's reviews.  Then he felt himself.  Well, nothing has changed in my head.  This is despite the fact that I have been using the iPhone for over a year now and consider it a very convenient device. <br><br>  In general, several thoughts were born that were formulated in a column for <a href="http://www.3dnews.ru/">www.3DNews.ru</a> .  I‚Äôm not going to risk publishing entirely here (it‚Äôs just me who decided to chastise me for publishing my own texts?), Here‚Äôs a couple of quotes. <a name="habracut"></a>

      <i>Probably, this is not the best place to talk about how uncommon the head of Apple is (if you are interested in the details, look in the shops for the book ‚ÄúiCona: Steve Jobs‚Äù).</i>  <i>But for those who pray for this person in the company and outside, it is sometimes useful to remember that in due time he, with his insights, actually destroyed Apple‚Äôs sales, giving the Apple IIe to those who liked him personally.</i>  <i>Small and sexy computer for which no one wanted to write programs.</i>  <i>This is largely the reason for his hasty departure from the company in the 85th year.</i>  <i>Then Steve Jobs invented the computer of the future for eight years - NeXT, having invested in this, undoubtedly, an interesting occupation of hundreds of millions of others' dollars and not having achieved any significant market success.</i>  <i>And if it were not for a "by-product", NextSTEP operating system, which Jobs so successfully sold to Apple, his return from a startup to a real business might not have happened.</i>  <i>As well as the company Canon, which invested a couple of hundred million in NeXT, could have remained with its nose along with the investors smaller.</i> <br><br>  and further <br><br>  <i>The iPad is never a laptop replacement and a bad alternative to the ePaper ebook reader.</i>  <i>To buy such a colossus to listen to music on it is, at least, strange.</i>  <i>Watching a movie is probably possible, although I haven‚Äôt yet conducted lengthy tests on the effect of the iPad screen on my eyes.</i>  <i>Plus, Russian users will have to convert the video, as is the case with the iPod / iPhone (iTunes will not work in the foreseeable future).</i>  <i>To hold the device is not easy - it is rather heavy (700 grams), it is not equipped with hand grips (it‚Äôs not beautiful enough with them!) And, you see, it will slip out.</i>  <i>The ideal position of the iPad is not even on the knees, but between them and the stomach.</i>  <i>When you lie on the couch, pods a bigger pillow under your back, then the new Apple product just stands up perfectly.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Is it a coincidence?</i>  <i>Yes, of course not.</i>  <i>We all now know that for at least two years Steve Jobs spent much more time in bed than he would have liked.</i>  <i>Disease, medical procedures associated with it (very regular and long), preparation for surgery ... But what about without the Internet?</i>  <i>How without work with mail?</i>  <i>Without the same impossible!</i>  <i>It is uncomfortable to use a laptop in bed, on iPhone you will break your eyes, which means you need to urgently develop something that covers the need!</i>  <i>I dare to suggest that iPad prototypes were studied more and more in bed.</i>  <i>And as a result, the option that was most suitable for her was chosen.</i>  <i>And indeed, for reading mail and surfing, lying on a sofa, there is no better apparatus.</i> <br><br>  The whole article and proof that confirms that I didn‚Äôt study the issue by a press release <a href="http://www.3dnews.ru/editorial/apple_ipad_preview/">is here</a> <br><br>  Just like a joke.  "Everyone likes, and you do not!". </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/90214/">https://habr.com/ru/post/90214/</a></p>
