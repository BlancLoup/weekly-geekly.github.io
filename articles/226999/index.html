      On the Front-End stream, we will focus on issues of modern layout and development of the frontend.  Back-End flow will be devoted to the actual themes of backend development in various programming languages: JavaScript, Scala, PHP and others.  The secrets of various frameworks, their comparison and selection for specific tasks, as well as architectural issues will be discussed on the Frameworks / Architecture stream. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The conference program WebCamp: Developers Day has already been partially formed.  Among the accepted reports include: <br><ul><li>  <b>Single Page Web Application with Scala / Spray.</b> <br>  <i>Slava Schmidt.</i> <br>  The report will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the Single Page Web Application architecture;  Scala introduction;  introduction to Actors / Akka;  introduction to Spray.  The demo application development process will be shown. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Component-based application architecture.</b> <br>  <i>Artyom Tretiak.</i> <br>  How to create a great application and not die?  How to make an application extensible and easily supported?  How to cover it with tests? <br><br></li><li>  <b>Parse'im backend.</b> <br>  <i>Akim Khalilov.</i> <br>  Do you want to learn Backbone?  Do you want to just write client code without thinking about the server and how to process, store, back up everything?  There is a way out - store with Parse.  Parse is a platform that provides the ability to store data without worrying about the server.  Data warehouse, soc.  networks, push-notification, cloud code.  What is Parse and what it can do, about the library to use: <br>  - familiarity with the JS API and examples of use; <br>  - we start to code: stub-project; <br>  - code features: CRUD + buns; <br>  - hostam. <br><br></li><li>  <b>SQL Server Full-Text Search is not for me or building your own system.</b> <br>  <i>Oleg Rakitskiy.</i> <br>  What is under the hood of search engines?  Why did we decide to do something of our own, and not just quickly and easily ready solutions?  Clear and fuzzy search patterns.  How does everything work for us? .. <br><br></li><li>  <b>From cache to in-memory data grid.</b>  <b>Introduction to Hazelcast.</b> <br>  <i>Taras Matyashovsky.</i> <br>  On the basics of caching and popular types of caches;  the evolution from simple to distributed cache, and then from distributed to IMDG, will be explained.  The report does not describe the use of NoSQL solutions for caching and is not intended to compare the Hazelcast with other products or ‚Äúsell‚Äù it as the best solution.  Contains live demos of the framework. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Web application architecture: an overview of modern solutions.</b> <br>  <i>Ruslan Shevchenko.</i> <br>  On different approaches to the design of web applications and trends in this area, including both the relative mainstream and exotic solutions that may be of interest in the future. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Web Security: Cookies, Domains and CORS.</b> <br>  <i>Yuri Tchaikovsky.</i> <br>  On the principle of the same source (Same-origin policy) proposed back in 1995 and relevant to the present day and on the application and restrictions for cross-domain queries.  An example of CSRF attacks, as well as server configuration rules to protect against them.  On the latest innovations relating to the control of the origin of content to prevent XSS attacks.  Besides: <br>  - The principle of the same source. <br>  - Using cross-domain queries. <br>  - CSRF attacks (with demonstration). <br>  - Classification of browser queries. <br>  - Restrictions for cross-domain queries. <br>  - Server access control. <br>  - Features Internet Explorer 8, 9. <br>  - The principle of content security (CSP). <br><br></li><li>  <b>Principles of building an effective REST API.</b> <br>  <i>George Highlights.</i> <br>  The report is devoted to the underlying principles of the REST concept, on which the ideology is based.  It will consider a range of issues that need to be addressed when designing a new API and questions about the effectiveness of the API, which API will be convenient for your users. <br><br></li><li>  <b>DDD in PHP on example of symfony.</b> <br>  <i>Oleg Zinchenko.</i> <br>  The report will discuss what DDD is and why MVC has been misleading us for years.  As an author, I came to the conclusion that simply writing structured code is not enough.  The layers of the DDD application will be described as they interact with each other.  What architectural patterns are behind DDD and why they make a developer‚Äôs life easier.  When it is better to use DDD, what advantages and disadvantages does this approach have?  Examples of using DDD approach in symfony applications. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Optimization Lift Framework for working with large data streams.</b> <br>  <i>Slava Schmidt.</i> <br>  History of optimization of a single project Lift for working with an Oracle database to save large amounts of data.  Information about the intricacies of integration with Akka and Squeryl, the possibilities of accelerating work with the database and the jdbc caching driver developed. <br><br></li><li>  <b>The Big, The Small and the Redis.</b> <br>  <i>Andrey Savchenko.</i> <br>  The report is dedicated to Redis: one of the most underrated DBMS.  Having, at first glance, not very large functionality, on close inspection, Redis can give odds to the majority of fatter competitors.  How to properly ‚Äúprepare‚Äù it, where to put it into practice and how to stop in time and will be discussed in the report. <br><br></li><li>  <b>N2O: The Most Powerful Erlang Web Framework.</b> <br>  <i>Maxim Sokhatsky.</i> <br><br></li><li>  <b>Site / application optimization for mobile platforms.</b> <br>  <i>Ihor Shalimov.</i> <br>  About prioritization in the implementation of the RAD.js architecture;  about optimizing DOM and working with it;  About situations when everything is already optimized: bottlenecks repaint \ reflow and other expensive little things. <br><br></li><li>  <b>The performance of the website.</b>  <b>Methodical analysis and depth of client optimization.</b> <br>  <i>Yevgeny Kotelnitsky.</i> <br>  What affects performance;  indicator analysis tools;  correctly determine the goals and objectives;  depth of client optimization;  analysis of several sites that the audience calls. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Object gymnastics in PHP.</b> <br>  <i>Denis Potapov.</i> <br>  Object gymnastics - 9 programming exercises that help improve the writing skills of readable and testable code: <br>  - Only one level of indent in method. <br>  - Do not use Else. <br>  - Wrap all primitive types and strings. <br>  - First class collections. <br>  - One point per line. <br>  - Do not use abbreviations. <br>  - Keep entities short. <br>  - No classes with more than 2 attributes. <br>  - No getters, setters and properties. <br>  The report will consist of the description of the rules and their application using the example of a library for logging (Monolog). </li></ul><br>  Gold Sponsor: <a href="http://www.dataart.ua/">DataArt</a> . <br>  Sponsor: <a href="http://www.ciklum.com/">Ciklum</a> . <br><br>  <b>Registration and all details on the conference website at: <a href="http://webcamp.in.ua/">webcamp.in.ua</a> .</b>  Follow our announcements in the social.  networks.
