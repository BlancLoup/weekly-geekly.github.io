Despite the fact that there were few changes in the staff of the largest Russian IT companies and media resources, they attracted public attention. <br><br>  Someone took a step forward in their professional development.  Someone left the post of general director of the company in pursuit of their new ideas.  Someone left the company, as he did not have enough time to read books and rest. <br><br>  And someone was offered to promote "the direction of the company with unlimited resources and full support."
