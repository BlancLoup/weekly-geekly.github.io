Recent news was from the category of good - Uber has learned in advance to calculate the fixed cost of the trip.  As can be seen on the screenshot, after the paragraph of the marketing bullshit, it is reported that now this very estimated cost of the trip will be blocked on the user's card. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bc7/16c/ead/bc716cead71946e9a96ab6d3aa86be52.png"><br><br>  Previously, as experienced users have known, the payment was charged at the end of the trip.  And if the required amount was not on the map, then Uber was patiently waiting for the opportunity to remind you of it when you next try to call their car.  In other words, he allowed one trip to go into debt. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  But patience, as we see, is over.  Now, Uber will not get you anywhere if it cannot block the required amount on your card.  No legs - no cartoons.

      How sensible is this decision?  Uber ‚Äùcaptured the market due to its simplicity and convenience - and the person who chose a modern service is unlikely to let millet abandon it for the sake of not paying for one trip.  I judge, however, only by myself: for 3 years, in my opinion, the years of using ‚ÄúUber‚Äù, several times, when launching the application for ordering the next trip, I discovered that I had left the previous one unpaid.  Never once did it occur to me that it would be a great idea to never use Uber again and switch to Gett, for example.  On the contrary, it only strengthened loyalty to the service, which it did only friendlier, like a small shop in your house, where you would be sold a bottle of water for debt if you forgot your wallet at home. <br><br>  Only Uber knows the truth about how many trips hang forever unpaid.  Not knowing the whole picture so far (and in the Uber letter, not a word about the reasons for the policy change), the situation boils down to two possible explanations: <br><br><ol><li>  Uber users are in fact terrible rednecks with the ease of changing a stable and convenient service for one-time savings. </li><li>  real bastards are Uber‚Äôs marketers, who decided that their clients ‚Äôloyalty to a friendly service costs less than unpaid trips, and who decided that we no longer deserve trust, and our establishment account should be permanently closed. </li></ol><br>  To understand which of them is correct, it is enough to tell how difficult the situation with unpaid trips was.  Perhaps Uber users are actually worse than I imagined them (us).  In the meantime, adhering to the <a href="https://persons-aforism.ru/aforizm/4206">well-known principle of Helvetia</a> , I can‚Äôt take the side of ‚ÄúUber‚Äù. <br><br>  If the company suffered from specific financial difficulties due to bad debts for the trips, then I think the letter from it would have been much more articulated: sorry, dear users, but we were too often thrown at money, but we are <a href="https://ru.insider.pro/investment/2017-01-10/pochemu-uber-terpit-mnogomilliardnye-ubytki/">already unprofitable</a> .  The lack of specifics suggests that the banal watchman syndrome has become the real reason for the policy change: ‚Äújust think of something - go into debt, I won't let this happen anymore!‚Äù, Shamefully hidden behind marketing idle talk. <br><br>  So-so move, "Uber."  However, this is only a test run so far, so if the resent is loud enough - the company may change its mind. <br><br>  Well, in the place of Yandex-Taxi, I would have thought about how to wrap it to my advantage. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/403215/">https://habr.com/ru/post/403215/</a></p>
