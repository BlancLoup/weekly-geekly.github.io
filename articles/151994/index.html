  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Group sex not practicing</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In my practice, quite often there are situations when a large audience is present at the presentation of a work.  For example, five or more people.  Director, manager, "head of the transport department," people who just passed by.  In one of the large companies they called for a presentation ... a cleaner ... Literally: ‚ÄúMarya Vasilyevna, come in, look!  What do you see? " <br>  When so many people are present at the presentation, the likelihood that the job will be accepted is often zero. <br><br>  <b>Preliminary preparation.</b> <br>  You should know everything about your work, all the parasitic associations, all the pitfalls.  Be ready to answer any question about your work, explain the sokraral meaning of each bend.  Do a little more than what is expected of you.  This is always a plus for you. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>At the very presentation.</b> <br>  It is necessary to clearly and accurately identify the person responsible for making decisions.  Try to appeal to him.  Not sure who is in charge?  Ask a question directly. <br>  People tend to come different, but I can highlight a few of the most vivid "characters."

      <b>1) The oppositionist.</b> <br>  There is always a person who will stand in opposition to the rest.  Protest for the sake of protest.  And he will most likely do this subconsciously in order to show his competence and viability.  To show the most important boss that he is "not like everyone else."  He will put forward counter-arguments for any arguments.  This person will pretend that he does not like everything, and that he would have done better and better, and so on. <br>  How to behave if such person is present at the presentation? <br>  Ask questions to this person.  The questions are not blurry, but specific, for example: What exactly is in the developed sign or logo that you don‚Äôt like and why?  Why do you think that this particular font solution is not suitable.  More questions from you - less from him. <br><br>  <b>2) Suspicious.</b> <br>  This is a person who literally "will all seem."  For example, he saw it somewhere, or these elements remind him something (as a rule, well-known trademarks or any obscenity). <br>  And he will certainly say it out loud.  Here the psychological effect will immediately work: all those present will immediately see the same thing.  It always happens.  For 15 years of practice I have been convinced of this many times. <br>  How to behave?  Ask for address.  Do not be shy!  Why do you think so?  Or do not you think that everything around for something like?  That, for example, all people face the same: everyone has eyes, a nose, a mouth. <br><br>  <b>3) Young professionals.</b> <br>  This category of people who have just finished their studies in some institution with a very loud and beautiful name.  They always know what and how, and what trends are in fashion.  People are good, but, unfortunately, with extremely little experience. <br>  For example, when developing a logo for one of the companies, we were told several times that the black and white version of the sign is not needed, because the current level of technology development makes it easy to do without it.  We did as requested: a version with gradients that could ‚Äúwork‚Äù only in full color.  Six months later, the management accused us of incompetence, because they could not put our developed sign with laser engraving on a souvenir. <br>  Ask a trivial question: how and where is it planned to use the developed logo or mark.  Let them give some examples from life. <br><br>  <b>Summary.</b> <br>  1) Always appeal to the elder.  Build a presentation for him. <br>  2) Feel free to ask leading questions. <br>  3) There is no need to prove anything to clinical idiots.  In this case, we get up and leave. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/151994/">https://habr.com/ru/post/151994/</a></p>
