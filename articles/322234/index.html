We give an example of how to calculate the estimated amount of traffic. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We have the following conversion rates: <br><br><blockquote>  average CTR - from 0.1 to 1% <br>  average CR - 2 to 15% and in <br>  The average payout is $ 2. </blockquote><br>  We can calculate how many impressions you need to get one conversion: <br><br><blockquote>  CR = Conversions / Clicks * 100% <br>  CTR = Clicks / Impressions * 100% -&gt; Clicks = CTR * Impressions / 100% <br>  CR = Conversions / (CTR * Impressions) <br>  Conversions = CR * CTR * Impressions </blockquote><br>  Accordingly, for one conversion we need 1 / (CR * CTR) impressions.  Since we have a CTR of 0.1 to 1%, and a CR of 2 to 15%, we need at least 666 impressions and a maximum of 50,000 impressions. <br><br>  It turns out that for one conversion you need from 700 to 50,000 impressions.  Next, consider how many conversions you need.  If we have two dollars, a thousand conversions will give us $ 2000 of earnings, and not pure, but Revenue.  And to earn $ 2,000, we need to get 1-50 million hits. <br><br>  The earnings formula starts working when we have a lot of traffic.  When the traffic is not so much, it works, but not so interesting.  There is a question: ‚ÄúWhere can I get a lot of traffic?‚Äù <br><br>  Traffic can be obtained in several ways. <br><br>  There is <b>free traffic</b> : SEO, email-mailing, mailing in messengers and social networks, various own platforms: blogs and video blogs. <br><br>  There are many types of <b>paid traffic</b> : <br><br><ul><li>  Search traffic, contextual advertising on Google, Yandex, Bing, Yahoo </li><li>  Traffic from social networks, targeted advertising on social networks: VKontakte, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and so on. </li><li>  Mobile Display - sites, applications, various banners that are posted on these sites and applications. </li><li>  Pops - popander, clickkander, all sorts of tabs that open automatically in a mobile device, the so-called annoying ads. </li><li>  Video advertising - Youtube and Vimeo and various advertising video networks. </li><li>  Teaser networks. </li><li>  Native advertising in applications. </li></ul><br>  Paid traffic allows you to quickly test hypotheses: they invented a creative approach, purchased traffic, looked at efficiency, adjusted the approach, if necessary. <br><br>  Free traffic does not always allow to test quickly.  In addition, paid traffic is easily scaled: if the bundle works in plus, increase the traffic and scale the advertising campaign.  The volume of free traffic in this regard is very limited. <br><br><h2>  The main sources of mobile traffic </h2><br>  Now we will analyze the main sources of paid mobile traffic.  There are many different sources of traffic: <br><br><ul><li>  Social networks </li><li>  Search </li><li>  Pops </li><li>  Mobile display </li><li>  Content Discovery - teaser networks </li><li>  Video Formats </li><li>  Native advertising in mobile applications </li><li>  Various built-in SDK and Adult. </li></ul><br>  Let's talk about each of them in more detail. <br><br><h3>  Social networks </h3><br>  <b>Social networks</b> (Facebook, Instagram, MyTarget (VK, Odnoklassniki), Twitter, Pinterest) - one of the most popular traffic sources with a large user reach.  Almost every resident on the planet uses a social network.  The huge reach and involvement of users is one of the main advantages of social networking traffic.  A user logs in to a social network regularly, searches for interesting articles, talks, plays, and watches videos.  Such an advertising context of users is easy to use for converting goods into sales or installing mobile applications, it fits many categories of offers.  The user is relaxed: it is easy for him to give a product that fits this request. <br><br>  Social networks have a good native advertising format: the user does not consider this format as an advertisement, it organically fits into the usual news feed on the social network.  We get high CTR and user confidence.  Social networks know a lot about the user: gender, age, interests, which users and which groups are subscribed to, what likes, repost and comments.  There are services that allow analyzing interests and gathering audiences on certain parameters, this gives us great opportunities for targeting. <br><br>  For social networks, entertainment content is best suited.  Offers on mobile games and dating come well on social networks.  When the user wants to have some fun, he does not need to do complex operations.  Thanks to the targeting capabilities, social offers can also promote complex offers.  Sell ‚Äã‚Äãapartments: find users who are interested in these apartments. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/104/dff/52d/104dff52d5904a6287d821198f9d8c6a.jpg"><br>  Advertising banner VKontakte and Facebook organically fit into the advertising issue - in a regular feed, among the news that the user constantly consumes.  To promote offers, we also use posts in the communities. <br><br><h3>  Search advertising </h3><br>  Another type of traffic is <b>search advertising</b> .  When we talk about search advertising, we mean Google, Yandex, Bing, but that's not all.  There are, for example, 7search or yahoo.  Contextual advertising also has a huge reach.  The user regularly uses search engines to find this or that information.  We need to find a restaurant, we are looking for the Tverskaya restaurant, we need to download a game, a strategy - we are looking for strategies and choose what we will play. <br><br>  The search engine audience is a hot audience that is actively seeking information.  We solve their search problem, due to which we get a high conversion to the actions we need.  On the other hand, such advertising is expensive and you need to be able to work with it correctly. <br><br><h3>  Pops </h3><br>  <b>Pops</b> - popanders, clickanders and redirects.  This type of traffic is not known to everyone.  Let's see what it is.  When a user visits a mobile site, he automatically sends it to another mobile site - this is a redirect. <br><br>  In another case, when a user visits a mobile site, he automatically opens another tab with another mobile site.  It turns out that when the user closes the current tab, he hits the opened second - these are popanders, clickers. <br><br>  In general, Pops is not very popular among ordinary Internet marketers, due to its reputation as an annoying advertising format.  Users treat it negatively and want it not to be.  As a result, we get cold traffic, which is difficult to convert. <br><br>  Despite the fact that such advertising is rarely used, in mobile arbitration it is a popular advertising format for certain offer verticals.  Its advantage is high coverage.  On many sites there are scripts that make popanders, clickanders and redirects.  In aggregate, redirects provide no less coverage than social networks. <br><br>  Another point is that it is suitable only for specific offers.  Usually, the user must somehow be forced to pay attention to the content that we offer him, and in this case, success can be achieved - the user will download this or that offer. <br><br>  There are trips in the form of sudden notifications, messages from the browser or from the operating system, where users are encouraged to download the application or take action. <br><br>  This format is well suited for Gambling categories, where the user is told how someone has earned a lot of money.  If the user is looking for easy money, he will easily react to this message. <br><br>  Not all categories are suitable for the format of redirects and popanders, but if you work correctly with this format, some types of offers can be started on it.  From popular networks: Zeropark, Popads, Popcash, DNTX, PropellerAds. <br><br><h3>  Mobile display </h3><br>  The next type of advertising is <b>Mobile Display</b> , banner advertising in mobile applications and mobile sites.  Of the largest ad networks: Google Admob, Google DoubleClick, Mopub, Appnexus, Go2Mobi, Mobfox. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/828/399/dac/828399dac6bc4fa1872f6bb3db784a57.jpg"></div><br>  These ad networks interact with a huge number of sites, allow them to easily install their scripts on websites and on applications and show various banner advertisements. <br><br>  They give us the opportunity to place their ads and spin on different advertising sites - this gives a large coverage of users, one of the advantages of such advertising networks. <br><br>  Another advantage is standard advertising formats.  All grids use the conventional sizes of creatives, formats for creatives, and if one ad network works well for you, you can then use these banners in the arc of the advertising network. <br><br>  The effectiveness of advertising on such advertising platforms depends specifically on the area where the banner will be displayed.  Since we are located at several sites at once and do not always know where this banner is shown: somewhere it will fit the context of users and will be shown in a convenient place, but somewhere not.  In order to evaluate the result and effectiveness of advertising, you need to understand on which site our banner is shown and with the right platform and approach, many offers can be turned into advantages and efficiently procure impressions, clicks and convert them into actions. <br><br>  In such services there are contextual targeting either by topic or by categories of sites.  For example, we can age all of our ads on all mobile apps in the travel category or on all mobile sites for women. <br><br><h3>  Teaser networks </h3><br>  The next type of advertising is <b>teaser networks</b> or <b>Content Discovery</b> .  There are several major sources: among the Western - Taboola, Outbrain, Revcontent or MGid, from Russian - Market Guide, Teasernet, Visitweb. <br><br>  Not everyone knows what a teaser advertisement is.  Most of you have seen various banners on entertainment sites, where shocking images and headlines are used, how someone lost weight very quickly or became rich, how to remove a stomach in 2 days - this is a teaser advertisement. <br><br>  Teaser networks unite a lot of entertainment sites, such as adme.ru, fishki.net.  or ViralNova and Buzzfeed. <br><br>  Usually on such sites there are several teasers: the user first reads one story, and then goes on to others.  For teaser networks, it is important that the advertising content is viral: users have to click, go, learn something new, therefore click ad headers are inherent in the ad format when it reads something and cannot resist to click and find out what was on. <br><br>  Targeting should be customized to users who already use such content.  If we want to find users who want to read something interesting, teaser networks are a good way to find such users. <br><br>  This format is well suited for various product offers: products for weight loss, smoking cessation, or cosmetic products that remove wrinkles.  There is also Gambling or Forex, when users are told how someone got rich very quickly and easily.  User can easily convert to such offers. <br><br>  If you can figure out how to submit material through such entertainment content and further send the user to your offer, then a teaser format will work well. <br><br><h3>  Video Formats </h3><br>  The next type of traffic source is <b>video formats</b> : Youtube, Facebook with targeted video ads, MyTarget, which also recently released targeted ads in video format in the news feed. <br><br>  There are separate advertising grids that collect various mobile applications and websites and show ads there, for example, Adcolony or Vungle. <br><br>  The video provides a high involvement of users, because in one video you can bring a lot more information than, for example, in a banner.  There are different formats: pre-roll, fullscreen, overlay, banners on top of the video. <br><br><h3>  Native banners </h3><br>  The next ad format we‚Äôll look at is <b>native banners</b> , mobile SDKs that are embedded in mobile apps.  For example, you can display ads to the user when he has completed a mission and receives an award. <br><br>  There are many native formats, each SDK allows you to place a particular type of banner.  There are several popular formats: <br><br><ul><li>  Offervol.  When a list of various offers or some items is shown, and among them you can insert an advertising item. </li><li>  Advertising in the news feed.  When you are in your news feed, you can add an ad unit inside your application. </li><li>  Inter-screen fullscreen when a user plays a game or uses a mobile application, when switching from one screen to another, a screen pops up with an advertisement.  This is less annoying advertising compared to conventional banners, due to which the user has more confidence in such advertising and more often it is possible to increase user involvement simply due to new and interesting content. </li></ul><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e12/694/678/e12694678c434bb7a4653bb5c40164ac.png"></div><br>  The effectiveness of advertising is highly dependent on the site on which advertising is placed.  Using such networks, you are located on many different sites.  For some kind of platform, the format and banner will do, for some not, somewhere the children play the game, somewhere the women use this application. <br><br><h2>  User context </h2><br>  We figured out the traffic sources, now let's talk about <b>the user's context</b> - an important factor when analyzing the traffic source.  When we talk about the types of traffic, we mean that the user is in a particular context and depends on it, which offers will work and which will not. <br><br>  User context - goals and objectives that are directly facing the user.  If we answer this question, we will understand how the user reacts to the advertisement: how he clicks, what he expects, and what actions he is ready to perform. <br><br>  The context depends on the cost of traffic.  There is a hot traffic, for example, with contextual advertising, when a user is looking for a taxi to the airport, and we show advertising "taxi to the airport."  He wants to find a taxi, and he will click.  And there is cold traffic: pornotrofik or redirect traffic, when the user does not expect at all that he will show ads. <br><br>  Always think about the user: what he is doing, what content he consumes.  From this will depend on the format of advertising: he is ready to make a purchase now or not ready. <br><br>  There are advertising platforms, such as Yandex.Market or Avito, where the user is in a state where he is looking for something, and on such sites advertising offers work well, where we give the user something that he can buy.  Or move it to a mobile application where it can buy something, for example, in AliExpress. <br><br>  It is also worth remembering where the user is now: at home, at work, at school, in the subway.  This affects what we can show the user. <br><br>  The user's context influences the effectiveness of an advertising campaign and must always be taken into account when developing advertising concepts and creatives. <br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  In this large block, we have now considered the various types of traffic sources that you can meet in mobile arbitration.  We looked at their features, where the audience lives, and how to work with it correctly. <br><br>  The next lesson will be about conversion types in arbitration. <br><br>  You can ask any questions about arbitration in the comments or in <a href="https://vk.com/mobionetwork">our VKontakte group</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/322234/">https://habr.com/ru/post/322234/</a></p>
