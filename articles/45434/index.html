  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Partnership program of the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media of Russia</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  All organizations that need to attract someone to cooperate, create partnership programs.  The essence of such programs depends on the type of cooperation - someone needs to ‚Äútie‚Äù developers to their technologies, and someone wants to close the software manufacturers to its consumers.  It seems to me that an affiliate program could be useful to our Ministry of Relations and Mass Communications. <br><br>  Have you heard about Linter?  Many will answer without hesitation: "No."  If you ask: ‚ÄúHave you heard about Oracle?‚Äù, There will be much more affirmative answers.  And in the meantime, there is a commercial domestic DBMS, called <a href="http://linter.ru/ru/main/" title="Domestic DBMS Linter">Linter</a> , which has been leading its history since the early 80s of the last century.  Today, Linter manages the movement of airplanes, Linter passes people to the subway, Linter pumps oil, catches criminals, controls outer space, protects nuclear reactors, stores music in home theaters and cell phones, works on Russian submarines and much more. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Why, then, in the tender documentation for the development of state and municipal information systems, we only find Oracle?  Or <a href="http://www3.pgz.economy.gov.ru/trade/view/purchase/general.html%3Fid%3D104974251">MS SQL Server and Oracle</a> ?

      This is just one of the examples that demonstrate that Russian money is given to foreign companies solely because they are better known.  Even the largest Russian IT corporations are negligible compared to foreign ones.  And organizations of hundreds of people are all the more unnoticeable next to the marketing activities of the American giants. <br><br>  How can the state support domestic producers of non-primary sectors of the economy?  It goes without saying: tax cuts.  The initiative is great, but very controversial.  There is another way - to adopt someone else's experience. <br><br>  Nokia is a good example.  It does not produce its own software.  Software for its phones is written by independent developers developing on the favorable soil of the partner program created by Nokia. <br><br>  Here you can draw some parallels: Nokia - the state;  developers - companies wishing to participate in the construction of state information systems.  Nokia gives partners access to documentation on their technologies, gives discounts on the purchase of prototypes, allows advanced companies to participate in world exhibitions at the Nokia booth, helps other marketing tools, even recommending cellular operators to work with solutions of partner companies.  Thus, Nokia brings together software manufacturers with its consumers. <br><br>  In the same way, the state can help experts developing tender documentation to better understand the situation with the software of partner manufacturers that has proven itself on the market.  For example, it may turn out that Linter will be better implemented in district tax inspectorates, and at the federal center level - Oracle.  The use of Linter is also proved by the fact that this DBMS is already serially certified for the highest class of protection against unauthorized actions and the highest level of absence of undocumented features.  Therefore, it is much easier and cheaper to certify an automated system with Linter than with any other DBMS. <br><br>  The absence of other serially certified DBMS for the highest level of protection is not accidental.  In the <a href="http://www.rg.ru/oficial/doc/min_and_vedom/mim_bezop/doctr.shtm">Doctrine of Information Security of the Russian Federation,</a> among the threats to ‚Äúthe security of information and telecommunication facilities and systems, both already deployed and created in Russia‚Äù are indicated: ‚Äúthe introduction of components in hardware and software products that implement functions not provided for by the documentation for these products‚Äù;  "The use of non-certified domestic and foreign information technologies, information protection tools, information tools, telecommunications and communications in the creation and development of the Russian information infrastructure".  The threats to the ‚Äúdevelopment of the domestic information industry‚Äù in the Doctrine include ‚Äúthe purchase by public authorities of imported information technologies, telecommunications and communications in the presence of domestic counterparts that are not inferior in their characteristics to foreign models‚Äù. <br><br>  But how to be sure that Linter works no worse than Oracle, that Linter is a well-tested solution?  In turn, this can be learned from the Microsoft partner program.  This corporation takes in the partners of those software developers who can provide at least three customer reviews.  And the clients of these developers should themselves confirm to the Microsoft representatives that they are really satisfied with the software they have implemented.  Partners of the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media can be equally obligated to provide customer feedback. <br><br>  However, information that a partner of the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media has happy customers is not enough to include the partner product in the tender documentation.  An expert who writes or checks a technical task should first-hand verify the viability of the solution that will be used in the state information system.  For it you need to conduct a course of study, including both theoretical and practical classes.  The training of specialists in technologies includes all partner programs of foreign corporations.  But they teach partners their technology, and the Ministry of Communications needs partners to train experts.  So this point will be quite natural in the partnership program of the Ministry of Communications. <br><br>  Of course, additional people are needed to work with partners of the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media.  Money to pay for their labor can be taken from the partners themselves.  This is exactly what most corporations that launch affiliate programs do. <br><br>  Thus, the introduction of the partnership program of the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media of Russia will not only support domestic software producers, but also ensure the implementation of the Information Security Doctrine of the Russian Federation, as well as many equally important legislative acts. <br><br>  Russia will not be able to be the leader of the world economy if it does not win technological dependence.  In the information age, it is very important to produce our own computers and our own computer programs.  If we plan to make domestic production of computer technology at the expense of a breakthrough in nanotechnology, then Russia can get its software by including the partnership program of the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media. <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/45434/">https://habr.com/ru/post/45434/</a></p>
