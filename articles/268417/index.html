For the last six months, my team and I have been developing a small, but very useful, as it seems to us, web service.  Initially, we developed it for the needs of our own online stores, but quickly realized that it would be useful to many. <br><br>  I have been postponing the launch of our ship on a long journey for a long time, trying to bring it to the ideal.  Currently only 50% of our ideas are implemented.  But if we do not start up now, I'm afraid we will not have enough enthusiasm to continue working.  We really want to see the reaction of the audience in order to understand where to go next.  To be sure that people really need the product. <br><br>  Therefore it is decided, open up!  Today!  Free for all users! <br>  <b>Meet - <a href="https://anve.ru/">ANVE.ru</a></b>

Therefore, below I will tell you more about the main features of ANVE.ru. <br><br><h2>  With the help of our service, the SUPPLIER can: </h2><br>  <b>Create personal accounts for their dealers</b> <br>  No need to write TK, hire programmers, buy hosting and support it all.  Everything is much simpler: register, download price lists and stock balance and invite your dealers to the service.  You can update the data either manually using excel files or automatically via synchronization with 1C or any other system. <br><br>  <b>Flexibly configure access rights</b> <br>  The service allows for individual dealers to open access to different types of prices and stock balances.  For example, large dealers can show more favorable prices, and for regional dealers to open access only to the remnants of the warehouse closest to them.  You can also restrict access to only certain product groups. <br><br>  <b>Send notifications on receipts, promotions and discounts</b> <br>  Now we are working on the functionality that will allow you to notify dealers about important events as efficiently as possible.  No message will go unnoticed! <br><br><h2>  And what can dealers? </h2><br>  <b>View data of their suppliers</b> <br>  It's all clear.  Each dealer sees the data of all his suppliers, who use our service and open access to it.  There is no need to download and update, the suppliers themselves will take care of this. <br><br>  <b>Upload data by yourself</b> <br>  The dealer can load price lists and residual files into his account, which he receives from the rest of his suppliers who do not use ANVE.ru.  This, of course, takes some time, but it allows you to collect all the data in one place. <br><br>  <b>Quickly find products, compare prices, send orders</b> <br>  When all data is collected, it is a pleasure to look for them.  The dealer can instantly find the most advantageous offer among his suppliers and send an application for the goods he is interested in. <br><br>  <b>Set up a link with your own nomenclature</b> <br>  The dealer can also upload their own goods to the service and link them with suppliers' goods.  This is very convenient if the dealer sells products by renaming them, or if different suppliers offer the same product under different names. <br><br>  <b>Use API to upload data to the site</b> <br>  Any data can be unloaded from the service using the API.  This will allow, for example, to indicate on the dealer website information about the availability of goods.  Or automatically raise "up" those products that now have suppliers, and hide the missing. <br><br><h2>  And, of course, the search for new partners! </h2><br>  In the near future, we will launch a functional that will allow suppliers and dealers to find each other.  Now there are enough similar services, but all of them either constantly demand money, or turn into ‚Äúgarbage dumps‚Äù with irrelevant data.  We hope to collect the largest base of ‚Äúlive‚Äù suppliers, attracting them with a wide free functionality of the service. <br><br><h2>  PS </h2><br>  Now the service is absolutely free, but in the future we, of course, plan to monetize it.  However, we will always have a fairly functional free fare.  In addition, all users registered now will receive significant discounts after the introduction of tariffs. <br><br>  We will be very happy to receive your comments, ideas and feedback! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/268417/">https://habr.com/ru/post/268417/</a></p>
