  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Who needs these SMS?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The Internet is practically everywhere, and where there is none, Ilon Musk, whose SpaceX plans to launch about 4.5 thousand communication satellites by 2024, will come to the rescue.  Communication between people on the planet goes to instant messengers.  But communication between people and brands still requires proven technology.  At least, while 4,5 thousand satellites will not plow open spaces of space. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/064/fb7/369/064fb73699dc458f98c1f61af64a91f8.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The generation of millennials - young people between the ages of 15 and 35 - refers to communicating with brands differently than their predecessors.  Young people rely much more heavily on modern technology and often categorically do not accept the old methods of communication.

      Ignoring their wishes will not work, because today it is one of the most numerous groups of consumers, and very soon it will become the main one. <br><br>  If the business succeeds, they will become free advertising agents.  Brand loyalty for this generation is high, like no one else before. <br><br>  According to studies, millennials insist that business communicate with them through text, not voice.  Short text messaging service (SMS) is the best tool for this.  Perhaps the era of the revival of this service? <br><br>  For a start, a reference about the millennials, very brief, since they were written about <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/search/%3Ftarget_type%3Dposts%26order_by%3Drelevance%26q%3D%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258B%26flow%3D">repeatedly</a> on Habr√©. <br><br>  The Millennial generation refers to people born from 1980 through the early 2000s.  Although all these people are very different, they are distinguished from previous generations by the habit of using all available technologies, the fast pace of life, and the passion for new impressions.  The first two factors - the love of technology and the rhythm of life - predetermine how millennials prefer to receive information.  Most often, they do not want to communicate with companies and brands over the phone and, especially, ‚Äúlive‚Äù (they turn out at the cash desks of banks on the day of utility bills on a social network to laugh), preferring instead to receive text messages. <br><br>  Yes, according to a <a href="http://www.chiefmarketer.com/millennials-prefer-texting-to-communicate-with-businesses-survey/">study</a> conducted by the Chief Marketer service, about half of the surveyed representatives of the Millennial generation prefer to receive certain information in the form of messages on a mobile phone. <br><br>  Among the types of messages that millennials clearly want to see on the screen of a smartphone are financial information and warnings about possible dangers, delivery reminders and other notifications.  Also, this generation does not like to talk on the phone so much that it would even prefer to write to the support service if necessary, rather than use a free call number.  Apparently, the point is not that in the twenty-first century there was a boom in introvert births, but simply the evolution of technology formed a coil on which it became interesting and convenient to print symbols on the device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/4a4/551/6e6/4a45516e656d4cc0afbde11079ab8494.jpg"><br>  It seems that the time has come for business to reconsider its attitude to such a communication channel as SMS.  In various communication channels find niches for effective use.  This means that marketers are thinking not only about which message to deliver to existing and potential customers, but also how to deliver it.  And for some messages, the best delivery method is an old and reliable SMS. <br><br>  Indeed, in many ways, the SMS technology has long outlived itself, and it has been supplanted by communication via instant messengers.  There is some truth in this - personal messages and long dialogues between people really ‚Äúmoved‚Äù to these platforms.  However, text messaging does not surrender its positions.  Moreover, in some areas, the popularity of this platform is growing.  If you need the message to be read, and read immediately after receipt and read where the Internet may not be (Ilon, is it possible to launch your satellites faster?) Then there are no SMS analogues. <br><br>  <a href="https://simpletexting.com/individuals-willing-to-receive-text-messages/">Studies</a> show that there remains a huge number of categories of messages that people, especially millennials, would prefer to receive as text.  First of all, these are messages about discounts, technical information about transactions and account status, as well as special offers and urgent notifications.  SMS is also convenient for carrying out the simplest transactions, for example, checking a balance or replenishing an account. <br><br>  In order to provide these and similar services to its customers, businesses need to connect to the A2P platform (Application to Person, which means ‚Äúfrom application to person‚Äù).  Modern A2P platforms allow you to organize two-way communication between the company and the client via SMS, and can also become part of a more functional omnichannel platform. <br><br>  Using any of <a href="https://www.infobip.com/ru/platforma/rassylki/sms">the SMS messaging platforms,</a> it is important to consider every detail.  For example, due to a banal error when encoding a message can come in unreadable form.  The operator must provide these points.  Also, in a globalized business, your customers may be residents anywhere in the world.  This means that when sending messages, the operator should be familiar with local features, ideally have contacts with partners in the field. <br><br>  Another important function is the updating of the database of telephone numbers.  The more invalid numbers in the database, the more money spent on mailing goes into the void.  This feature is provided by advanced messaging platforms. <br><br>  Finally, analytics is of great importance. It is collected at the end of mailing.  What was the response, how many messages were not read and why, what is the final cost of the campaign per user.  All this information advanced platforms are required to collect. <br><br>  It is equally important to remember that SMS is still relevant as a channel for marketing.  According to the polls mentioned above, the millenial generation is ready to respond to special offers and discount coupons sent through this channel.  Marketers should not forget the short message service in the list of tools used.  Of course, the submission must be competent and delicate.  Spam mailings discredit and new technologies of message delivery, it is not known to receive in messengers which is just as unpleasant as with SMS. <br><br>  About twenty years ago, when the first SMS just started to gain popularity, the first text revolution happened.  People have chosen this method of information exchange as fast, convenient and indispensable in individual cases.  Later, SMS technology faced tough competition and temporarily faded away, but now we can talk about the era of its revival, or even the second text revolution.  And the reason for this is not only technical progress, but also demographic, and more precisely, generational preferences. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/329096/">https://habr.com/ru/post/329096/</a></p>
