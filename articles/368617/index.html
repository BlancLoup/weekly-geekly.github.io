      An interactive toothbrush marked ‚Äúsmart‚Äù is both an experiment and a necessity, as Arseny, like many children of his age, does not care much about the health of his teeth.  And, like many children of his age, with great pleasure drank sweets. <br><br>  At the same time, to force / explain that brushing your teeth is a clear need, we are not succeeding, and he is not at all keen on the process, leaving him alone.  We have to ‚Äúclean up‚Äù ourselves, often with ‚Äúkickings‚Äù and excuses.  In this case, we have already visited the dental office and the RDK (early children's caries) has already been treated. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d5d/32c/fe7/d5d32cfe7a0f4f519e3331714476daaf.jpg"><br><br>  The chip of the <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/grush-igrovaja-zubnaja-schetka-dlja-detej.html%3Futm_source%3Dgktms%26utm_medium%3Ddeti%26utm_content%3Dgrush%26utm_campaign%3Dzub">Grush smart toothbrush</a> is gamified.  It interfaces with IOS and Android devices using software, where children have the opportunity to play 2 minutes into the game, and for parents to monitor the quality and number of ‚Äúapproaches‚Äù. <br><br>  Actually, the game as a method of "training" to the brush is recommended by psychologists and dentists, and it works.  The child was carried away and immersed in the process so much so that upon completion it could not be dragged off.  At the same time, he completely fails to notice that he is brushing his teeth, and for him the whole process is reduced to ‚Äúkilling bacteria‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e11/0cd/4aa/e110cd4aa1f14f12b22a0b9ced22ff3e.jpg"><br><br>  For our age - 3 years - the game itself was too dynamic, and Arseny struggled to keep up with the plot, during which harmful microbes appear in different parts of the oral cavity.  The photo shows that he brushes his teeth not where it is provided at the moment, but arbitrarily, but at the same time he withstands the allotted time to the end.  And asks for more. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/302/68e/53a/30268e53ac8f474389ac41d4281073b9.jpg"><br><br>  Grush brush is offered in a small box where you will find three interchangeable heads.  It works from one ‚Äúmizinchikovoy‚Äù battery and syncs via Bluetooth with devices IOS and Android. <br><br>  Application game: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/es/app/grush-toothy-castles/id995883509%3Fmt%3D8">Ios</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.grush.toothycastles">Android</a> </li></ul><br><br>  Parental control: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/grush-parental-dashboard/id973310826%3Fmt%3D8">Ios</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.grush.dashboard">Android</a> </li></ul><br><br>  * <i>Tested on both platforms</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1f9/f7a/60e/1f9f7a60e85540cda7ab5051603a5abe.jpg"><br><br>  <b>IMPORTANT</b> .  For me, it was a crucial moment to turn off the vibration.  The brush is electric and therefore buzzing.  Arseny is wary of such sounds, such as a drill, various kinds of rattling, and I understood that it wouldn‚Äôt work to get him to put something like that in his mouth.  But even though the brush head does not rotate, there is vibration.  The second pressing of the button after switching on removes it without interrupting the connection with the application, and in our hands is the most common brush. <br><br>  <b>Cardboard</b> <br><br>  Guided by personal experience and <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/obzory/prilogeniya_dlia_sporta/android/luchshie-prilozheniya-3.html%3Futm_source%3Dgktms%26utm_medium%3Ddeti%26utm_content%3Dvr%26utm_campaign%3Dpodborka">our selection</a> , I threw VR glasses into the house, and then it turned out, as they say, to amuse children and amuse themselves.  Games, even the most simple, were not very clear, but virtual tours can take children for a period of time.  Yes, and my wife and I were fun to watch as they walk across the apartment, bumping into the door. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f26/893/e1c/f26893e1c6124a91ad3f81d9b08b7ba8.jpg"><br><br>  The most beloved was ‚Äúride the cart‚Äù Fibrum.  By the way, the process of assembling Cardboard may be of particular interest for small children, and for them this is also part of some kind of action. <br><br>  We tested <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/shlem-cardboard.html%3Futm_source%3Dgktms%26utm_medium%3Ddeti%26utm_content%3Dcardboard%26utm_campaign%3DVR">this</a> cardboard on the Iphone 5, and the <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/universal-naja-povjazka-video-ochki-dlja-prosmotra-3d-video.html%3Futm_source%3Dgktms%26utm_medium%3Ddeti%26utm_content%3D3dglass%26utm_campaign%3Dglass">plastic</a> on the Iphone 6 Plus. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c2e/27f/cb3/c2e27fcb35ac42c3acd7d1bfade81a92.JPG"><br><br>  To keep, of course, it was not so easy for them, I suspect that the visual was not very clear there, and therefore we did not participate in this process for a long time.  But the spectacle clearly fascinated them, and when they are older they may well be entertained in this way. <br><br>  <b>IMPORTANT</b> .  By the way, on a cardboard box I got such a warning that magnets could disrupt the pacemaker. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a31/eee/9af/a31eee9afc164d96bd389a090e679e2a.JPG"><br><br>  Considered as a souvenir or a gift to a primary school student - you can, however, have more entertainment programs for VR than ‚Äúeducational‚Äù ones.  Have a home - you can.  You can also make yourself a projector from a magnifying glass, drawing paper and a box for shoes.  However, one does not exclude the other. <br><br>  <b>IMPORTANT.</b>  From myself I will add that the most <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/obzory/prilogeniya_dlia_sporta/android/luchshee-prilozhenie-vr-dlya-detej.html%3Futm_source%3Dgktms%26utm_medium%3Ddeti%26utm_content%3Dvr%26utm_campaign%3Dsoftblog">interesting thing about the EON application</a> , which contains pictures from many areas of human knowledge and activities: architecture, history, electronics, transport, biology, anatomy, and others. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/33c/d35/58c/33cd3558cb4148b4a375d81d237fe60f.jpg"><br><br>  You can admire the eyes, the brain, military cars and dinosaurs, and if there is no virtual reality helmet, the same pictures are available in the "Mono" mode.  I recommend to look. <br><br>  <b>Verve</b> <br><br>  An interesting, but ‚Äúnot past in age‚Äù device is a <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/verve-2.html%3Futm_source%3Dgktms%26utm_medium%3Ddeti%26utm_content%3Dinxus%26utm_campaign%3Dverve">universal board</a> for creating your own control algorithms for something or ‚Äúdeveloping‚Äù simple smart devices. <br><br>  We started with a simple one: change the management of familiar flash toys.  For example, they tried to replace pressing the "space" with a pop or a separate button. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cec/d6e/6dd/cecd6e6dd414416cbc467b58b48aecdc.jpg"><br><br>  However, the functionality of this board is slightly wider, and with its help, you can discuss the basics of programming together with older children, set your own algorithms for notifying about any events, for example, sending letters if there is light at home.  Something like a "security system."  Once about all this there <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/medgadgets/blog/245695/">was a small review on Habrahabr</a> . <br><br>  The board works with 8 sensors that are connected in series to the connectors, after which the action that they will perform and the conditions for when this will happen is selected. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dcd/238/4e6/dcd2384e6ff9416daaf919445daeb16b.JPG"><br><br>  Included is copyright software and two simple toys on a flash drive, and the ‚Äúspace‚Äù plot of one of them with simple controls is understandable for children and not very ‚Äútough‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/90c/4a0/367/90c4a03677d149bea9ea3b30c0aa6914.JPG"><br><br>  <i>Hm</i>  <i>For a long time did not wipe the laptop.</i>  <i>Excuse me.</i> <br><br>  Verve2 is sold in a small gift box, which contains all the necessary wiring, crocodiles and, of course, sensors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e2c/5e0/9ba/e2c5e09bab074d1790b8e43ea3d581ef.jpg"><br><br>  The device is connected via mini USB, after which you need to press a single button.  No additional installation is required: all on a flash drive.  Works on both Windows and MacOS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/728/8bb/c1f/7288bbc1ff20484c9df2243c7ace7215.jpg"><br><br>  It is still <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/verve-2.html%3Futm_source%3Dgktms%26utm_medium%3Ddeti%26utm_content%3Dinxus%26utm_campaign%3Dverve">sold in Medgadgets</a> , also for details you can refer <a href="http://myinxus.com/welcome/verve2all/">to the official site</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b18/b22/ba1/b18b22ba15ce49c1bbb5d457bf6261ef.JPG"><br><br>  <b>Sensors included:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Button sensor - a sensor that fixes a button click.  It takes a measurement when you release the pressed button.  Press the button so the sensor responds; </li><li>  Light sensor - light sensor - measures the level of illumination.  For example, by shining a flashlight or creating a shadow (by covering the sensor with your hands, with your body or in another way), you can get a sensor response; </li><li>  Magnet sensor - magnetic sensor - measures magnetic fields.  Bring it close to the magnet, for example, to the one included in the kit to get a response; </li><li>  Motion sensor - motion sensor - measures changes in speed.  Shake it, for example, from left to right to get a reaction; </li><li>  Sound sensor - a sound sensor - measures the level of the surround sound.  To get a sensor response, you can, for example, click your fingers, clap your hands, or talk / shout next to it; </li><li>  Temperature sensor - a temperature sensor - measures the ambient temperature.  To react to the sensor, place it in a cold or warm place; </li><li>  Touch sensor - a touch sensor - measures small changes in electrical conductivity, for example, when your body touches both contacts.  Attach, for example, contacts to your body (and your friends ‚Äôbody) to get a sensor response; </li><li>  Turn sensor - turn sensor.  The rotation sensor measures the rotation of the rotary knob.  To get a response, you should rotate the knob back and forth. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>3Dali</b> <br><br>  Anboxing and review pen was one of <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/medgadgets/blog/248540/">my first posts on Geektimes</a> , and this is the most understandable device for sharing creative evening with children. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f3a/d88/8a8/f3ad888a8fd14d5db26b9488becd13a1.JPG"><br><br>  + <br><br><ul><li>  Fascinatingly </li><li>  Unusual </li></ul><br><br>  - <br><br><ul><li>  Can get burned </li><li>  Not everything works </li><li>  Dear plastic that disperses instantly when you draw with children </li><li>  Smell, but children do not attach importance </li></ul><br><br>  It‚Äôs impossible to draw voluminous things with small children, but it‚Äôs very unusual for them that you can pick up the pictures, touch, break, remake, finish again and so on. rather trying to memorize and reproduce some steps: <br><br><ul><li>  Draw a line </li><li>  Stay </li><li>  Wait until cool </li><li>  Postpone </li><li>  Restart </li></ul><br><br>  So far, it happens that most of what I bring home for them is a wonder, and they try to participate in it, because they simply see something new, unusual for them.  Willingly try on trackers, smart watches. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/60e/efa/7c9/60eefa7c9cda4be9994052568d017c68.jpg"><br><br>  But the same 3D pen with systematic use, when it ceases to amaze, can be an excellent incentive for all sorts of experiments with the form.  In one form or another, I would recommend to keep something similar at home. <br><br>  <b>Luminous</b> <br><br>  Our timeless classic is a smartphone-controlled <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/svetodiodnye-lampy-luminous.html%3Futm_source%3Dgktms%26utm_medium%3Ddeti%26utm_content%3Dlight%26utm_campaign%3Dluminous">Luminous lamp</a> , known since the days when we wrote on Habr.  Permanent joy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/684/d6f/fb4/684d6ffb47b3438980c920ac6407bb91.jpg"><br><br>  It cannot be said that it is in the full sense ‚Äúa children's toy‚Äù from the category ‚ÄúSmart Home‚Äù, but the thing is uniquely attractive as a single item that can be different.  The most demanded function is the change of colors and shades, which can be used with a certain conventionality for methodological purposes of repetition, if you learn colors. <br><br>  Then different modes, preset blinks and blinks, are interesting, and at the end of the day, when you go to bed, the child can turn off the light from the phone himself.  In any case, it is fun, interactive and a little magical.  What really. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5c1/17c/d1a/5c117cd1a98d41ad9a92569e2c18c86d.jpg"><br><br>  The toy is not for two, since the lamp is tied to one device via Bluetooth, and this is - in my case - its main drawback. <br><br>  <b>Toys</b> <br><br>  Recently, toys have appeared in the catalog: drones, robots, robots-designers with solar batteries, but just toys at home are a mountain, so I don‚Äôt bother much about this topic.  I'll tell you about the simplest. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b62/240/e61/b62240e61d354bed85da73c3c6d97ac7.jpg"><br><br><ul><li>  A falling robot, which then falls, then rises, and so - until you get bored.  For this sight you need <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/padajuschij-robot.html%3Futm_source%3Dgktms%26utm_medium%3Ddeti%26utm_content%3Dpadayu%26utm_campaign%3Drobot">to pay 900 rubles</a> .  By the way, first you have to collect it! </li><li>  <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/robot-na-solnechnyh-batarejah-3-v-1.html%3Futm_source%3Dgktms%26utm_medium%3Ddeti%26utm_content%3D3v1%26utm_campaign%3D3v1">Robot-tank-scorpion</a> : designer solar-powered.  The model is not expensive, since the ‚Äúset‚Äù is very limited, but for small children, ‚Äú3 in 1‚Äù is enough.  650 rubles. </li><li>  The simplest - in the bathroom - the <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/powerup-boat.html%3Futm_source%3Dgktms%26utm_medium%3Ddeti%26utm_content%3Dpower%26utm_campaign%3Dup">boat from Power Up</a> .  It is not governed by anything.  Just a motor and a model. </li></ul><br><br>  Separately add about the company Icon, the range of which includes creeping, and rolling, and flying.  We, for example, <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/icontank.html%3Futm_source%3Dgktms%26utm_medium%3Ddeti%26utm_content%3Dicon%26utm_campaign%3Dtank">Icon Tank</a> .  It happens in two colors, it is easily controlled using a special application, so that the toy will be understandable to anyone who used similar devices with the remote control. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/AmmdDmRToM4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhz7X5lBMcEJCc4548Q_bxr8tEktg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The device is mated in the phone settings, after which the application interface is simply launched.

Everything is better than fights. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/80b/a62/47a/80ba6247a32146aebbf1d3b76042c846.jpg"><br><br>  Icon Tank costs a <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/icontank.html%3Futm_source%3Dgktms%26utm_medium%3Ddeti%26utm_content%3Dicon%26utm_campaign%3Dtank">little more than 3,000 rubles</a> . <br><br>  I also took a look at <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/icon-toys-icongolf.html%3Futm_source%3Dgktms%26utm_medium%3Ddeti%26utm_content%3Dicon%26utm_campaign%3Dgolf">Icon Golf ‚Äî a golf driven ball</a> ‚Äî a slightly larger simulator that has a built-in battery can change colors. <br><br>  The ball itself is whole, and is sold with a charging station.  In size, it is significantly larger than golf balls, but for comparison, I can only attach a ping-pong ball. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2cb/a73/d8c/2cba73d8c1574d4c9caabc6224f05178.jpg"><br><br>  In the application, you can choose how to control the device, what color it will be, or run it according to a predetermined algorithm.  Immediately - charge indicator and some other settings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3bd/dad/4fe/3bddad4fe3174c13af6d0bd841f454bf.jpg"><br><br>  Actually, the main difference between the ruler and similar controlled toys is that all of them are controlled from applications for IOS or Android and have a slightly larger number of settings or ‚Äúaction games‚Äù, but the rest is simple and understandable things.  Look at them: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/icon-toy-iconrobot.html%3Futm_source%3Dgktms%26utm_medium%3Ddeti%26utm_content%3Dicon%26utm_campaign%3Drobot">Icon - Helicopter Robot</a> .
