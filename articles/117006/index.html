What is it and what is it for?  By and large, this is a small thing, the main task of which is to record everything that the driver sees in the windshield of his car.  For this "useless" piece of Chinese plastics, sometimes they want a lot of money, so many people consider buying it inexpedient, preferring to buy some kind of subwoofer.  However, in the life of any driver it can happen (pah-pah-pah) such a moment when such a device may be the only salvation - it will take just a moment, and the DVR, unlike the subwoofer, will have time to pay for itself many times.  Nobody is insured from adventures on the road, just some will breathe with relief, while others will immediately realize that the recorder is needed after all.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  All situations in which the registrar may be useful, not to list, but from the main - this is, of course, an incident.  ‚ÄúGood,‚Äù if the car just crashed and no one was hurt - when you come to, you can watch the recording of the incident, analyze it, put it on the network and show it to your friends.  And if you happen to hit a pedestrian at speed ... and most likely, you can put a cross on at least two destinies at once - try and then prove that the pins <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DcYLCAJiZjL4">themselves ran out onto the road</a> .  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DemCYHvhe1NU">Flew into a hole</a> on an unfamiliar road and ruined the drive or even the whole suspension?  Here you can only wish success and patience in the fight against the ‚Äúroad builders‚Äù.  Someone braked sharply in front of you with idle stop lights?  Without video recording, even with the presence of witnesses, you may be guilty, because you did not observe the distance - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DoDlUoYh4XMA">there are</a> automatic <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DoDlUoYh4XMA">supports</a> , albeit rarely.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DT9x6vVS3vE8">Conversations with inspectors</a> happen a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DT9x6vVS3vE8">bit</a> more often - here too the DVR will come to the rescue.  In general, a lot of other things can be thought up - I wrote about some unobvious applications at the very end of the article. <br><br>  In the meantime, look at a small selection.  It was I who chose it for a number of reasons - firstly, there is a whole assortment of examples of images from cameras of all stripes (try to pay attention to the quality of the picture while watching), and secondly - a 99% ‚ÄúRussian‚Äù selection, clearly showing the metamorphosis on our roads: <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/jka6PQkEAt4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjOBYKh9XJ_bEiiWfGL8S3DvyoF_g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Some time ago, as a DVR, I had to use the HTC HD2 communicator.  Despite the good recording quality ( <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DclxiSdR4V2w">example 1</a> , <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DBUlXsXsqFTU">example 2</a> ), this solution had a luxurious bouquet of disadvantages and inconveniences: in the summer in the recording mode, it was heated like a hell pan, because of which the records were often covered with artifacts or even broke in emergency mode and became unsuitable for viewing.  A couple of times the free space on the card unexpectedly ended.  It was problematic to talk on the phone.  I had to give up navigation.  No, I do not slander my favorite HD2, but the fact is a fact - on 9 trips out of 10 I scored on the traffic record, which, in general, is wrong.  Eh, and so wanted to ‚Äúclick and click‚Äú - you go quietly, and the registrar writes himself and writes. <br><br>  Everything changed with the appearance of a full-fledged DVR in my life - the happiness finally became complete, and my hair became soft and silky) The beginning of the painful search put <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DHPLAsKSUkzc">one video</a> that was once <a href="http://autokadabra.ru/post/41556/">posted</a> on Kadabra.  I was surprised not so much by the funny act on the recording, as by the combination ‚Äú1080p + normal number of frames + with a time stamp + with sound + with color + in the dark‚Äù.  I asked a question in the comments, it was supported and very soon the name of the device became known - a certain <b>Karkam Q2</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d7a/98b/e84/d7a98be84ca35d8338da6586f5a11201.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Karkam Q2</i> <br><br>  On the Internet, this device is mostly positive reviews, and all the negative comes down to ‚Äúvery much too expensive - you can take on the dialectrime exactly the same, but two to three times cheaper‚Äù.  By the way, the Q2 twins really were full - F200HD, F500HD, F880HD, F900HD, ACV Q2, Datakam and others.  Everywhere there are pluses and minuses - I leave this question for independent study ... and I continued to fiercely crave for exactly the record from which I was so impressed. <br><br>  He continued to want to, struggled with the toad, smoked forums - waited for the moment when the device disappeared from the sale) And if somewhere there were a few things in the warehouse, then absolutely at the space price.  I forgot to say that I was only interested in the model with firmware 6.1 - there is no sense in taking others. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cab/22a/87e/cab22a87e38d3674616a865fc30a5b23.jpg" align="left" alt="image">  Suddenly, the <b><a href="http://www.av808.ru/html/kapkam_q3.html">Karkam Q3</a></b> model loomed on the horizon - thus I realized that the manufacturer is still alive and its range of devices based on Chinese patterns has been continued.  But I didn‚Äôt even consider this model due to the lack of a screen - I really wanted to see what the registrar could see. <br><br>  And finally, there was information about the new <b>Karkam Q4 Lite</b> , which will be discussed in this review.  According to the characteristics, it is exactly the same as Q2 that I liked, but this time in a shockproof case, with infrared illumination, ... at the same price!  This time I didn‚Äôt have to think it over - I ordered it and in 2 days I was brought (to Moscow from St. Petersburg by EMS). <br><br>  Looking ahead, there is still a <b><a href="http://www.av808.ru/html/kapkam_q4.html">Q4</a></b> model (without ‚ÄúLite‚Äù), the main distinguishing feature of which is the presence of an integrated GPS module.  However, very many (including consultants from specialized stores) almost in one voice said that this model is still raw in terms of firmware.  Keep in mind - in the review it is about the Lite-version. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0860a8">Karkam Q4 Lite.</font>  <font color="#0860a8">Specifications.</font> </h2><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="8">  <b>Video</b> </td><td>  Camera </td><td>  Built-in 5 megapixel lens 120 degrees, sensor 1/2 ", mechanical IR filter </td></tr><tr><td>  Resolution </td><td>  1920x1080 @ 30 frames per second <br>  1440x1080 @ 30 frames per second <br>  1280x720 @ 30 frames per second <br>  848x480 @ 60 frames per second <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Day / night mode </td><td>  Automatic switching to night mode at low light levels </td></tr><tr><td>  Loop Recording </td><td>  Cyclic recording in blocks of 1/3/5/10/15/30/45 min.

However, a regular mount means installing only on the windshield, but still, let it be on someone else's conscience. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#E36C09">Appearance</font> </h2><br>  Any DVR has a rather peculiar look - when you see it on the windshield of a car, you immediately understand that it is a recorder, and not some kind of phone or navigator.  Accordingly, it is not necessary to loom it before the inspector once again - he will understand everything himself) <br><br>  The Karkam Q4 Lite recorder body is made of rough-to-touch plastic - the design is rather monolithic, but I have some doubts about the declared impact resistance. If I had a metal case, I would have believed it, and so ... well, it really looks more reliable than many other ‚Äúdelicate‚Äù devices. <br><br>  On the shooting side, there is a 5-megapixel camera's eye, a microphone, an infrared light and its mechanical switch.  Just below ‚Äî the mounting holes for fastening ‚Äî there is provided both a conventional ‚Äúnavigator‚Äù connector and a standard threaded hole for the equipment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/22f/a44/caf/22fa44caf1654f322401ef0696fd939b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I did not like the fact that the glass (even if it is protective) of the lens is not protected at all, although it is one of the most prominent elements - I am thinking about putting some protective washer around the ‚Äúeye‚Äù.  The same is true for IR illumination, but it no longer protrudes out of the case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3fc/a6e/b92/3fca6eb925c0bbdfa2abedda440d2464.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the control side there is a color two-inch display, a 4-position joystick for menu navigation, 4 control buttons, a recording indicator and a hole for the Reset button (just in case).  Initially, a protective (or shipping) film is pasted on the screen. <br><br>  The functional elements of the device do not end there - the memory card cover is moved away from the bottom (automatically closed) ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/73c/9e4/078/73c9e4078b25e2ac9460edfa97dda06b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c12/8a4/ae2/c128a4ae2ddfe7351f095f1e576b7389.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  ... on the right is a connector for external power supply (from the cigarette lighter), and on the left is a rubber plug.  Behind it is the HDMI output and a connector for connecting to a computer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/934/071/fcc/934071fcc6d8203378a78f959672d6e0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It is a pity that instead of the standard USB connector (mini or micro) a rare PC / AV version is used - if you lose the original wire, you will have to run.  Well, okay - the necessary cord is included, and you can drop files without it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/58c/50d/b0a/58c50db0a2e266858fa8b951584e78c5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0a6/302/83a/0a630283addd132d05fab127fc3444da.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But the presence of miniHDMI turned out to be very useful - if in conventional camcorders this connector can be useful once a year for promptly outputting the footage to the big screen in front of guests, then this big screen (for example, from the car‚Äôs head system) can be connected as a viewfinder instead. what's on the device.  Then it will be much more visible - for example, in order to revise the recording of a dubious section of the road, when you are imputed to travel under a brick) Due to the absence of such a screen in my Lamborghini, I checked the performance only on the TV: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/YRRDZFJl3tQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgPoVy3ie21LZSqEyZINGwYcOueQA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The device fits comfortably in the hand and is generally quite compact ... although it could have been thinner, as it seems to me. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a82/1c0/423/a821c04237630b5ffd13268b1ba9504f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/492/4c9/6f3/4924c96f353ebcba1b23530ccabcee2d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/96a/9c5/42f/96a9c542f9a1f4e0a51ce1dba90fadc0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  All buttons are embossed and pressed clearly;  I just didn‚Äôt like the lack of contrasting signatures - it will take time to memorize the meaning of each of them on an intuitive level. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f04/c46/e5b/f04c46e5b6eac90367e974462b5196f8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Some discomfort will also be caused by the location of the IR illuminator switch - I would transfer it to the control side. <br><br>  In an amicable way, it would be necessary to disassemble the device and see how it is glued there from the inside, but this time excuse me. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#E36C09">Turn on and work</font> </h2><br>  The device turns on in two seconds - immediately after that you can start recording.  Even not, not so - when a power supply appears, the device is able to turn on itself and start recording automatically.  And also automatically finish recording when the car is turned off, including after the time interval specified in the settings. <br><br>  Immediately after launch, a viewfinder image and several indicators appear on it: operation mode (photo / video), recording quality, IR illumination status, recording time, battery charge (if there is no external source), and availability of a memory card. <br><br>  First of all, I go to the settings, of which there are already two tabs - the first is responsible for the device itself, the second is for the mode of operation.  The firmware version at the time of writing is 2.8 085-GBH. <br><br>  A small tour of the system settings.  Adjust the date and time - if you wish, this information can (and should) be superimposed on the video.  It is also possible to enter the registration number of the car, which can also be embedded in the recording files.  I heard somewhere that in the case of a trial video files without a date can not be considered as evidence, so I decided to specify everything as it is. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3fb/73d/a5c/3fb73da5c8bd23ee0a048ed37c45600f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  You can turn on the microphone in (s) and configure the power saving mode - for example, so that the device turns off when idle, and during shooting the screen only worked for a while.  I made it so that the image on the screen was always displayed, regardless of the selected mode and connection method - more relaxed when I see what the recorder ‚Äúsees‚Äù and what the ‚ÄúRec‚Äù icon is lit on. <br><br>  You can change the volume of the shell (initially all actions are accompanied by a loud whipping) and specify the frequency of the backlight (50 or 60 Hz).  It's nice that everything is all in Russian, although English is also available. <br><br>  Now about the settings of the modes of operation.  The five-megapixel camera allows you to write video in different resolutions - 848x480 @ 60, 1280x720 @ 30, 1440x1080 @ 30 or 1920x1080 @ 30.  The fact that I will only use FullHD (1920x1080 in color at 30 frames per second) I didn‚Äôt even doubt - I understand that you don‚Äôt have enough space on the memory card in this format ... but the devil, as they say, is in the details - often in videotapes The crucial role is played by some trifle, which can be seen only at the maximum settings.  By the way, at the moment I use a 16 GB card. <br><br>  In case the camera is fixed ‚Äúupside down‚Äù, the settings allow you to rotate the image 180 degrees (and the entire menu, respectively, with reassigning the joystick orientation).  Extremely useful setting, especially when you consider that a standard mount from the kit implies just such an installation option. <br><br>  Night mode.  Writing in color takes up a lot of space, and at night it‚Äôs completely out of place - why not write in b / w?  In addition to saving space on the card, it will minimize the noise level on the recording.  There is an automatic mode of transition from day to night mode, and you can choose one of seven light levels for such a switch.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DHPLAsKSUkzc">An example of</a> setting <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DHPLAsKSUkzc">operation</a> (0:10 - 0:18). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cb6/324/063/cb63240639cae9e9988d3d1ce0469553.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Cycle recording (in blocks of 1, 3, 5, 10, 15, 30 or 45 minutes).  Another useful feature that is not found in many ordinary cameras.  Allows you to "cut" the video to be cut into pieces so that the output does not have a huge non-heavy file (in case the record cutting is disabled, which can also be done).  If you activate the loop recording, then in addition to cutting files, they will be recorded on the memory card in a circle - if the card is full, the oldest records are deleted and new ones are written on top of them.  Conveniently, when you go and do not care that the place on the memory card has run out - another reason in favor of choosing the maximum quality of video recording.  But at the same time there is a protection against deletion, which can be done separately for any of the files - in order not to overwrite the necessary one. <br><br>  Here you can also mention another unobvious moment - the device works with the FAT32 file system (I have not tried others), that is, the maximum file size is 4GB.  Accordingly, it will be more reliable if you still cut the video into fragments (there are no intervals between the fragments, although I suspect that much depends on the class of the memory card). <br><br>  <b>Recording time</b> <table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>  High quality </td><td>  Medium quality </td><td>  Low quality </td></tr><tr><td>  1920x1080 </td><td>  3.6 GB / h </td><td>  2.4 GB / h </td><td>  1.8 GB / h </td></tr><tr><td>  1440x1080 </td><td>  3.0 GB / h </td><td>  1.5 GB / h </td><td>  0.75 GB / h </td></tr><tr><td>  1280x720 </td><td>  2.4 GB / h </td><td>  1.2 GB / h </td><td>  0.6 GB / h </td></tr><tr><td>  848x480 </td><td>  1.8 GB / h </td><td>  0.9 GB / h </td><td>  0.45 GB / h </td></tr></tbody></table>  As I said above, you can set up automatic recording and its completion - most of all, those who leave the car in the garage will appreciate it.  We started the car and the recording began, we muffled it - it was over.  Sometimes it gets in the way (at a gas station, or when you show a friend the registrar's abilities), but when you play enough - a complete time saver. <br><br>  Motion sensor - you can set the desired level of sensitivity, from 1 to 8. Accordingly, the recording will begin only when a motion begins in the frame.  You can specify a time (up to 60 seconds), which will be recorded after the movement stops.  Another feature that is not found in many ordinary cameras. <br><br>  Exposure, white balance, contrast, brightness, a couple of effects - everything is there, I will not go deeper. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e5e/329/272/e5e329272e2fcf8f5782524c5da859c8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The last interesting feature of this device is the presence of infrared illumination with a mechanical IR filter.  This is the case when it is completely dark, and you need to remove it - to be honest, for the first time I come across a device with such a function.  But, looking ahead, there is not much use in practice from this highlight ... well, now you will see for yourself. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#E36C09">A photo</font> </h2><br>  It turned out to be extremely useful that the device has a built-in 2000mA battery - it allows you to record for a long time without power from the adapter.  That is, the recorder can be removed from the mount and use it as a camera.  Yes, yes, as I said, there is also a photographing function here - I'll start with it. <br><br>  Because of the lens with an angle of 120 degrees, the frames are convex and with darkened corners.  But on the other hand, a lot of things fall in sight, and in fairly good quality - many DVRs see much less, forcing the owners to spend more on the wide-angle.  Each photo weighs from 1 to 3.5 MB. <br><br>  Sample photos by day: <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/abd/d65/8c5/abdd658c5acb28ed0c69f604cc1c266e.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1ca/b38/0df/1cab380dfa26032d79e9c50d45c9735d.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/af4/a46/fd3/af4a46fd3c1bf2cf576455a8fa230607.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1f6/40e/d34/1f640ed34fc6fea04654a7d2baf708d3.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ec3/e80/47d/ec3e8047d0684cca494d69a1a4d2aae0.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/777/901/95a/77790195aec862278ccab0c41ebee9f5.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  The detailing is good ‚Äî in some places even better than that of many average communicators. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a96/a61/6c8/a96a616c89b2572623f572970133d1f3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  With examples of night photography, you can easily distinguish three different modes - with the usual settings, in black and white, and with the IR illumination turned on: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/38e/a8c/50b/38ea8c50b685759b53c27c5e9de5f932.png" alt="image">  Clickable <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f0e/ef9/e07/f0eef9e07d671011b446c297792f8c84.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6f2/35a/4b8/6f235a4b8443fe36f346818bb720b2f9.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/701/079/9b9/7010799b90a3e3c02de9261d67caf23f.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f2b/640/6af/f2b6406afc93cbc9bc2f4f6955fc1fc8.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d8a/c68/69c/d8ac6869c10edd0316148b2b620a92e5.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  As you can see, in low light conditions, autofocus is much less tenacious, more thoughtful - moving objects are blurry.  Infrared illumination has a certain meaning only in close proximity to the object, that is, there is almost no point in recording the trip itself.  And it's a pity - I believed so ...) But on a more local scale, he can come to the rescue - for example, a photograph in complete darkness: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1ca/b42/92e/1cab4292e6cb55e3bc7704a20189fc7f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#E36C09">Video &amp; Sound</font> </h2><br>  Finally, we come to the most important thing.

But the efficiency is a little different from what I had imagined - I thought that, as in commercials, in total darkness, everything would be visible many meters ahead.  Alas and ah - only that in the foreground is visible ... but it‚Äôs better that way.  Therefore, I made the following conclusions for myself: <br>  - Any bi-xenon headlights will significantly improve the quality of records at night; <br>  - Especially if both headlights are on at the same time) <br>  - IR filter in most cases degrades image quality; <br>  - It is more expedient to record in automatic night mode - when black and white is written in low light, and in light - in color. <br><br>  As for the rest, if you don‚Äôt find fault with it, the image quality is really good.  The speed on the records seems slow - because of the wide angle, that is, when the oncoming objects are longer in the frame;  on the recording from the phone (higher), the speed seems to be more - the angle of view is smaller there, and therefore the objects ‚Äúfly by‚Äù faster.  Approximately the same applies to the distance - the video objects are deceptively farther than they actually are;  that is, all-all crashes on Runet's rollers - in fact, occurred directly in front of the shooting machine! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1db/944/3b9/1db9443b917ed6e567c0bd4b06b7b101.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  If you try, then on some cars (such as the same Civic or any Citroen) you can fit a piece of the dashboard into the frame - then there will also be speed data on the record.  And if you also fit the navigator ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b6b/04b/0d6/b6b04b0d6afda1eaa605fa372e4c5a71.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The sound recording quality is also quite good, although there is some unpleasant high-frequency background on it.  I was worried that the sound of the motor would be transmitted very strongly, but now I look at the recording and I understand that there is nothing terrible. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b3e/889/b17/b3e889b1765f9aad0e84f62cd76efbbc.png" alt="*">  <b>View</b> <br>  The ‚ÄúMode‚Äù button sequentially switches between three modes - ‚ÄúVideo‚Äù, ‚ÄúPhoto‚Äù and ‚ÄúView‚Äù.  In the latter case, the user appears all his records (6 pieces per screen) and photos. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/076/c4a/387/076c4a387eae50671818bf45c8d603bb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I liked the informational content of the screen - you can see not only the content of the video, but also the date / time of its creation, the file name and size. <br><br>  Despite the fact that I only made records in high resolution, the device easily rewound them at any speed and without jerks.  In each mode, the joystick and buttons are programmed differently - all this is written in detail in the instructions that I read with interest.  For example, I learned that the ‚ÄúRec‚Äù button in the video playback mode saves a still image to a separate JPG file. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b3e/889/b17/b3e889b1765f9aad0e84f62cd76efbbc.png" alt="*">  <b>Video editor</b> <br>  On the above, the buns do not end.  In addition to the built-in battery, the recorder has its own memory - 228 MB, which is enough for 3 minutes 44 seconds of video in maximum quality.  How to use this volume?  Select the desired entry on the memory card - most likely it will not fit inside the device, so we cut out from it only what is necessary.  Start the editor, hold down the REC button and ... for 3 seconds.  and in principle, you only need to specify an AB-gap - the resulting fragment can either be truncated or copied to the internal memory.  Then you can copy the file copied to the internal memory to a new memory card - and now you have the so-called ‚Äúcopy for the protocol‚Äù. <br><br>  Found software flaws: <br>  - There is no transition from summer to winter time and back; <br>  - Files are assigned some left names (the digit of the counter simply increases, which is reset when the card is formatted), although for the convenience of searching it would be more convenient to encode the date and time of recording in the titles; <br>  - If you enter the menu when the IR filter is on, it switches off without warning - you have to turn it on again (using the switch on the removing side). <br><br>  Now I take off on the settings that were set at the factory.  But I do not exclude that if you ask a question (with all sorts of exposures and white balance), then you can squeeze even more out of quality.  But as for the rest, I think that there is everything you need and even more for the successful recording of the ‚Äúroad‚Äù. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe jump depends on how you fold the parachute,‚Äù and with the registrar it‚Äôs about the same way you fix it and write it down.  I wrote some installation tips below, and with regards to the mounting itself, I‚Äôll say the following. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/383/84a/90f/38384a90f077a94ed281b423af12ecba.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Quite high-quality and reliable, but not very convenient - it implies installation only on the windshield, and upside down. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/66c/84a/b51/66c84ab51eee7a240be6c9ada329171d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It is impossible to fix the recorder in any other way - in any other way, the mount itself will occupy a good part of the frame. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c10/7ef/9d3/c107ef9d3407ebedf6897b001f835e21.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Well, it does not rotate - if the inspector stops, then the camera will not be able to point at it - you will have to disconnect the device.  Therefore, I will be grateful if someone prompts a good and convenient mounting model such as this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f22/de7/d48/f22de7d48cf826ae4e983e8c72b02466.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#E36C09">Situations</font> </h2><br>  For many, the word "DVR" is immediately associated with something bad - well, well ...

Well, or left;) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b3e/889/b17/b3e889b1765f9aad0e84f62cd76efbbc.png" alt="*">  Make it so that in the frame you can see as much as possible the ‚Äúuseful‚Äù road, and not the useless sky. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b3e/889/b17/b3e889b1765f9aad0e84f62cd76efbbc.png" alt="*">  Once successfully installed the mount, dismantle only the recorder - so that it can always be quickly and just as ‚Äúsuccessfully‚Äù installed. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b3e/889/b17/b3e889b1765f9aad0e84f62cd76efbbc.png" alt="*">  And even if you remove the mount, do not leave it in the car - in the cold the sucker loses its elasticity and will not stay on the glass until the ‚Äúwarm-up‚Äù. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b3e/889/b17/b3e889b1765f9aad0e84f62cd76efbbc.png" alt="*">  Naturally, do not leave the device itself in the car - I give a tooth, curl. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b3e/889/b17/b3e889b1765f9aad0e84f62cd76efbbc.png" alt="*">  Take care that the wire to power the recorder does not interfere with the management of the car. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f8e/675/813/f8e67581385a6da9ddd046fe08815e07.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>An example of proper camera mounting.</i>  <i>Only the power wire is better to hold for upholstery.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b3e/889/b17/b3e889b1765f9aad0e84f62cd76efbbc.png" alt="*">  The glass of the camera of the recorder should always be clean and nothing should interfere with the review - keep a lint free cloth or a napkin in the glove compartment. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b3e/889/b17/b3e889b1765f9aad0e84f62cd76efbbc.png" alt="*">  No less clean should be the windshield of the car - put a good wipers and stock up omyvaykoy.

For myself, I learned a long time ago that good things are not cheap ... nevertheless, before buying such a device, I was psychologically preparing for a price tag of thousands of five.  Here, the minimum price tag only starts from 8500 rubles (without a memory card) - on the website <b><a href="http://www.av808.ru/html/auto.html">av808</a></b> , which specializes in similar devices (at one time, the same <a href="http://www.av808.ru/html/eadeai_q2.html">Karkam Q2</a> at the lowest price I also found only there).  I simply did not find lower prices, and everything above is an unjustified markup.  The only BUT - this store is located in St. Petersburg, so delivery to Moscow went back to 300 rubles (2 days by EMS). <br><br>  As for all DealExtreme.  If the Q2 model had a lot of "twins" with very attractive price tags, then I haven‚Äôt yet found anything like Q4 on the net.  Although devices with identical characteristics are complete. <br><br>  Well, as I said, it would be nice to immediately purchase a bulk memory card.  Among the search results for the query " <a href="">32Gb 10class</a> " is full of offers starting from 1500 rubles per piece.  That is 10 thousand rubles will be enough to buy a good registrar, a large memory card and a more convenient alternative mount.  It is worth it or not - your business. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#E36C09">The end</font> </h2><br>  I‚Äôve been driving since 2007 - on the one hand, this is quite a bit, on the other - how much I have, everything is mine.  For all the time, pah-pah-pah, I didn‚Äôt get into any situations - there were no accidents before my eyes, autosubscription, very nimble drivers or inspection lawlessness (they mostly just check documents, although there were 2 or 3 well-deserved fines).  You can say, lucky, and therefore the DVR seems to be like me and not needed.  But I do not think so - I always remember that I live in a country of contrasts, where no one is immune from troubles.  I just had a DVR, but I will honestly say - it became somehow quieter right away, despite the fact that I had not had time to get used to this foreign body in my life.  A kind of black box that does not lie and, I hope, will not fail in difficult times.  After all, here as with the backup of important data - people are divided into those who make backups and those who MORE do not.  Therefore, I think that every driver should do ‚Äúbackups‚Äù ... however, you are all adults and must understand everything yourself) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f34/07f/d07/f3407fd0795809a7b048c9049f7a4cac.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  With the implementation of the basic function (video fixation of the fact that someone in someone from such and such a band and at such and such speed), even cases from telephones, not to mention specialized devices, will begin to cope.  Therefore, if the goal is to record videos for YouTube, you can save money and take <a href="http://www.av808.ru/html/auto.html">any</a> registrar, even the most openly Chinese.  But for more serious requirements (vigilance optics, image quality and recording speed) have to spend.  I chose the second, about which I wrote a huge article with a bunch of pictures - you, by the way, just read it. <br><br>  Successes, take care. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/117006/">https://habr.com/ru/post/117006/</a></p>
