  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Pause and restart an Adwords campaign if something is wrong with the site.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Many startups, and already established companies, spend on advertising funds that are comparable to the development of their product.  There are many tools and techniques for evaluating the effectiveness of advertising.  But, oddly enough, until recently there was no convenient way to monitor its performance.  This publication is about how to set up an automatic stop and restart of an advertising campaign using the <a href="http://www.host-tracker.com/">HostTracker website monitoring service</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/az/9d/1u/az9d1uwezkukhmufmx2dlrkicpu.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  What is the problem? </h4><br>  Sites sometimes fall.  Even very reliable.  And the money provided for advertising on these sites, continue to run away even in such cases.  The price of a question can reach hundreds of dollars for some idle time.

      Google, of course, also knows how to turn off campaigns, but there are nuances.  First, not all site errors are rated as critical.  Secondly, a large download delay is ignored if it arises - and this is a rather terrible problem: it is difficult to notice it, but it is uncomfortable to use the site, and users do not stay on it for a long time.  And thirdly, Google stops the campaign for good.  Well, that is, to restart, you must go through the whole procedure anew, including <a href="https://www.en.advertisercommunity.com/t5/Basics-for-New-Advertisers/Automatic-Rule-to-Pause-Campaign-if-Website-is-Not-Working/td-p/443672">moderation by Google</a> .  And this hours, if not days, idle. <br><br><h4>  Auto pause and restart </h4><br>  We have repeatedly received requests from customers to develop such a function.  HostTracker has already been used for this purpose: <a href="https://www.host-tracker.com/blog/HostTracker_under_Azure">subscribed to alerts</a> about the fall of sites, and then quickly turned off the site manually.  But now the automation has arrived. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/il/mc/pj/ilmcpjr5eoqzpmadlcfzbrqojhi.png"><br><br>  Yes, this requires you to specify your Adwords account details, and also confirm that access to this account is already in the Google Adwords interface.  But for 14 years of our work, we have never been seen in scattering customer data.  Also note that for six months this function worked in beta mode, it was used by our old customers.  Now we are ready to proudly present its official release. <br><br><h4>  How to set it up </h4><br>  To set up, you need to upload Adwords campaigns with a list, which you would like to turn off / on automatically when there are problems with a specific site (not available, long response time, as a result - it loads slowly).  But for more fine-tuning, it is advisable to put on monitoring, for example, by the presence of keywords, a specifically advertised page, and in case of problems with it the corresponding campaign is paused.  It would not be superfluous to indicate a delay before stopping; by default, it is 5 minutes to avoid triggering for short-term problems. <br><br>  As a result, the operation of all campaigns, as well as relevant sites, is easy to control from one interface: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3b/jw/n0/3bjwn0ke-lty3wu5zu2zvst9cmi.png"><br><br>  We welcome your comments and suggestions on how to improve this feature. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/351278/">https://habr.com/ru/post/351278/</a></p>
