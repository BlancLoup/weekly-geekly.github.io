Naturally informing your subscribers.  How?  Yes, just by updating the news column on your site. <br><br>  Next - thoughts in the ear, you can not read. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  So the provider has increased the cost of subscription fees from 300 to 400r.  since October 1st, which I found out quite by accident - by updating the MAC address over the phone, I checked the balance at the same time.  Then he asked the manager - what's the catch?  - to which he replied that everything is in the news, that the speed of all tariffs has been increased, and therefore the cost of subscription fees has increased.  Although I ran through the news for September-October 2008, I noticed only such news about the <a href="http://www.akado.ru/about/news/19.09.2008_15_37_0.html">increase in speed</a> and not a word about the cost.

      The funny thing is that my girlfriend did not enter into any agreements with Akado, did not put any check marks and nobody tried to inform her of any terms of the agreement in any way.  Simply, she used the Internet provider of the local (EXE-Novokosino).  Akado absorbed this local provider and once from the company they called her and asked: ‚ÄúDo you want a summer of free Internet from Akado?‚Äù, To which she agreed.  And since it was not necessary to change any settings (the Internet ran along the old wires), she didn‚Äôt come up with any equipment and didn‚Äôt hold any contracts. <br><br>  I know for sure that she wasn‚Äôt asked by phone: ‚ÄúDo you accept the terms of the contract?‚Äù And she never signed on Acado‚Äôs letterheads anywhere.  She was simply informed of the login / password for the control panel on the site and said, among other things, that the login is the contract number, and when paying through terminals (for example) you need to enter it. <br><br>  Dialogue with one of the girls on the line: <br>  - Hello, tell me, how much is the cheapest tariff Akado? <br>  - Good afternoon, 490 rubles, of which 400 for the Internet and 90 for those.  support <br>  - and I was hooked up at a rate of 290 rubles in Northern Butovo, now I will have to pay more? <br>  - no, you will pay as much as you have connected <br>  - why did Akado then unilaterally increase the value of my friend in Novokosino from 300 to 400 rubles? <br>  - ... I'm sorry, I can not answer you ... let me connect you with a person who understands better <br>  - OK <br>  ... <br>  - Hello (....) why this situation? <br>  This time, the manager was more prepared for this issue, read the item on the machine in an even voice about the fact that ‚ÄúAkado can unilaterally ... this is in the contract ... Akado is obliged to inform subscribers about changes in the media or other sources, which the website companies <br><br>  After the conversation, there was an unpleasant aftertaste.  Do you think this whole situation is quite normal?  There are no more sane providers left in the area, of the alternatives, only Comstar-direct (the new brand of the old ‚ÄúStream‚Äù) through ADSL, but he also seeks to increase speed by increasing the cost of services.  Now the cheapest Comstar is 350 rubles (unlimited, there is almost no traffic left in Moscow). <br><br>  And I ask you, understand correctly, you shouldn't think, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been stuck up, they‚Äôve given you free Internet all summer, and you‚Äôve been so grunted because of a hundred rubles!‚Äù <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> <a href="http://www.akado.ru/ai/file/17800922/file/2774_pravila_okazaniya_uslug_aka.pdf"><i>Rules for the provision of AKADO services, effective from August 1, 2008 (* .PDF, 357 kb)</i></a> <br>  7.2 AKADO - Capital has the right to: <br>  ‚ó¶ unilaterally change the list and composition of services, tariffs for services provided and <br>  works, as well as the procedure and method of payment for the AKADO Services; </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/43051/">https://habr.com/ru/post/43051/</a></p>
