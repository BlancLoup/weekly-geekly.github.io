  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Stop breeding bydlokoderov ...</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For a start - briefly about yourself.  I work in the system of additional education.  Circles, studio sections, etc. hr.  I supervise the direction of information technology.  My main business is to help schoolchildren to go to the chosen university, to pass computer science.  In addition, the programming circle - computer science, and PC users.  I teach not only me.  I coordinate the work of teachers in my direction.  + circles in schools.  But lately there has been a trend.  A social order is being formed for items related to IT - HTML, AJAX, PHP and other Internet languages.  Education is not ready for this weakly.  It‚Äôs hard to explain to a non-specialist why FrontPage is not the best code editor, especially if he has a 120 p.  where all the charms of this editor are painted. <br>  The first time bydlokoder I first met on Habr√©, and understood - our modern education was sharpened specifically for the production of bydlokoderov. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  The algorithm for their production is as follows. <br>  There is a talented, advanced, gifted, just wondering child.  His parents are willing to pay money for his education.  They take their child and lead to the school / station of young technicians in the computer science circle.  The teacher (at best, a good pascalist, at worst a teacher who graduated from the decree) receives an order and begins to fulfill it.  How?  He buys a book and starts learning from it.  + adds your knowledge and skills.  What you can get from this should be clear.  Recently on Habr√© showed an example of Romanian bydlokoda in PHP.  This is a very good C code, but it doesn't sound in PHP.  The specificity of the language is learned by practice, and a good school pascalist cannot have it. <br>  The overwhelming majority of their books are written by so-called ‚Äútechnical writers‚Äù - akyns from information technology.  What I see, I sing about that ... They strive to present the most complex material in the most accessible way, but this simplicity is worse than theft.  Even simple professional HTML is not as simple as it sounds. <br>  I myself almost fell into this trap, but I was lucky with literature - I quickly realized the level of complexity.  (thanks to J. Zeldman "WEB Design by Standards" and J. Coggsoll "PHP5"), but most of the literature ... "PHP5 practice of creating web sites" is, IMHO, a short guide to the codec.  And the authors are both honored and rewarded - the regalia occupies the entire cover. <br>  ‚ÄúEvery specialist is like a flux ‚Äî his completeness is one-sided.‚Äù Only by realizing this fact can we try to correct the situation. <br>  The solution that I would like to propose is not invented by me.  Last fall, I was preparing a girl for a scientific - practical conference.  During the discussion, an idea was proposed - to create a website where children make their projects.  Not only IT, any scientific projects.  In which a bunch of children - the supervisor - the teacher acts regardless of the distance.  The report met with approval.  He did not take places, but received not only a regular, but also a nominal promotional letter.  With hope for the development of the project. <br>  It was then that I began to seriously study the phenomenon of web 2.0.  By next spring I want to make such a site.  At first, even on a free hosting.  I'll do it for anyone.  But I do not want to multiply bydlokod, so I ask your advice.  Understand, if it were not for the conscience and the remnants of professionalism - I would not need them.  There are so few specialists that it‚Äôs not hard to get into anything. <br>  And yet, in the summer we will have a camp in the Elbrus region (God forbid +++).  We will have a fairly representative forum of both teachers and officials from education.  Is this idea worth moving further?  - your opinion. <br>  Shl.  Lord one more note.  This topic is not on the topic: "What is our X ... education."  And I ask you not to develop this topic in the discussion.  Everyone hurts ... I feel sorry for the children.  I have 3 stars in my group, and I‚Äôm not going to do anything else with them.  While correcting the mistakes of others and trying not to make their own, but "every specialist is like a flux ..." </div>
