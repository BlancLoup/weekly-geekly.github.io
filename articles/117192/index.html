  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Do you buy a ticket on anywayanyday.com? Make sure you are not sick!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In this post - my sad story of buying tickets on the site <a href="http://anywayanyday.com/">anylo.com</a> , the experience of communicating with their terrible service, as well as the fading hope of getting hard-earned, unused money. <br>  For those who are too lazy to read, a brief squeeze of the post: ‚ÄúI do not advise buying tickets on any on <a href="http://anywayanyday.com/">air.com</a> .‚Äù  The rest - I ask under the cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Such a strange title at the post due to a simple fact.  In August last year, I bought from any airline on the USA tickets round-trip tickets for the total amount of 41 thousand rubles.  Had to go to a science conference.  Unfortunately, two days before departure, he fell down with the flu and canceled the reservation.  Having recovered, I sent them an email about the disease with a request for a refund. <br>  After just a couple of hours, I was told that the documents were sent to the States to Delta, which will review them for about a month and make a decision (by the way, I specifically transferred the certificate of illness to the notary for this).  Wrote a month later - answered that Delta does not write anything.  Wrote a month later - no response to the letter.  Strange, I thought, before responded during the day.  I am writing one more thing - no answer.  One more thing - no.  (By the way, since that time the support service has never answered my e-mail). <br>  I call support - the answer is standard, Delta is silent.  I begin to think about the claim, but then the work pounced, and somehow forgot about the problem for several months. <br>  The winter is over - and I came out of hibernation: I remembered about my money, which lies on any direct route.  I went to the site, I saw links to vkontakte, facebook and twitter.  Posted in all their groups :) <br>  A day later, the answer - "We will understand."  After a couple of days, the robot responds to the post office - the refund is issued, the money will go to the card.  And now attention!  I paid for the ticket in cash through the Euroset service :) I call the support service - they say they will transfer it through the Contact system within two days.  I choose a bank, send it to the post office, duplicate the call with a call - everything is OK, we will translate. <br>  Five days have passed.  No translation yet.  For two days in a row, all calls to the support service are transferred to a certain person who is not currently in the office.  I asked this person to contact me in his working time - to which the answer is ‚ÄúIt will not work.‚Äù Why?  "We do not like that, you call yourself."  Hope to get the money goes out ... <br>  Why did I write this post?  Of course, I will continue to deal with this company, 40 thousand for me is not superfluous.  But he did not write to ‚Äúsoak‚Äù, but to warn you.  The website on anywayanyday.com is excellent, making out tickets is convenient and pleasant.  But God forbid you have any problems - get ready for unanswered letters, strange responses of operators and for almost a year of waiting. <br>  Nevertheless, I want to pay tribute to an employee of the company who monitors groups on facebook, vkontakte - he answers questions very promptly, and it looks like he initiated the return design. <br><br>  UPDATE: This morning, at the request of a social network specialist, I was contacted and informed about the transfer of money.  In the afternoon I successfully received them.  Almost an annual epic successfully ended. <br>  Thanks again to this unknown specialist. </div>
