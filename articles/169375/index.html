Before the release of the updated version of the <i>‚ÄúLittle Genius 2.0‚Äù</i> application <i>,</i> we once again invited young testers to our office. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a61/f06/e4c/a61f06e4c9844e0cc389592858da14c8.jpg"><br><br>  What came out of it - see below. <a name="habracut"></a>

      Like the Little Beetle, whose story we have already <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/littlebeetle/blog/167661/">shared</a> with readers of the blog, the Gnome Genius, the main character of the application, had a turbulent history of birth.  Once he was even an owl ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bd1/90d/168/bd190d168fbd9b64881f7665aa182006.jpg"><br><br>  ... hare ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/108/10f/c05/10810fc05402d89e6b88c3709fc55316.jpg"><br><br>  ... and after a while he acquired a human image, because the title "genius" must be associated with a person.  By association to the adjective "small" the image of the gnome arose.  This is how the Gnome Genius turned out. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b35/8b3/dff/b358b3dff597539a4abf4136cc228acc.jpg"><br><br>  He changed his appearance and headdress several times ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d50/30b/942/d5030b94292b28f2c972fcb5c0baee9c.jpg"><br><br>  ... to appear in a mature version of the application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bdb/537/38e/bdb53738ec0db4d6ffd5e9c07d2f7e5f.jpg"><br><br>  He had to part with the magic flying book and pastel caramel flowers to be closer to the other characters of Little Beetle.  A new version was waiting for a significant redesign.  The appearance of the main menu, the game map, as well as all interfaces has changed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/01a/675/a87/01a675a87fee7b07e305e22269089666.jpg"><br><br>  The application presents 4 mini-games, each of which is endowed with developing potential.  Games are distributed on 12 levels (in the previous version there were 8 of them).  The difficulty of tasks increases as you progress.  First game (left) - classic Memory Match.  We just suggest that the child find cards with paired images.  The second game (on the right) is aimed at finding matches.  The child is asked to select the same cards. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d9b/588/fee/d9b588fee067f8d8723754b8ea7b6285.jpg"><br><br>  The third game is a puzzle.  The more difficult - the more parts in it.  And finally, a respite - a small coloring, which also varies depending on the complexity of the current level. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/101/784/769/101784769344f05da1110deec85c3053.jpg"><br><br>  Such tasks were not chosen by chance.  They allow you to use memory (1st game), attention (2nd game), spatial and figurative thinking (3rd game).  During the last stage of coloring children relax and can get a break.  After each successful task of the child, the compliment and congratulations are sure to await - we adhere to this principle in all our applications. <br><br>  At the stage of testing our applications, the fate of the project, which is the work of a whole team for many days, is in the hands of children. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a69/346/fac/a69346facb1697ab0544038501dc361f.jpg"><br><br>  We organize testing as a real children's event - kids come along with their parents and always receive treats and gifts from Little Beetle.  There is always a teacher-psychologist with children and, of course, stern uncle programmers who are absolutely not angry with children, even if they have discovered some kind of "school". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/47d/952/bbb/47d952bbb39ec38abfb5e1e15dc48ef7.jpg"><br><br>  Testing is usually organized in a competitive form - those who complete the game faster will receive a prize.  Of course, the prizes end up being awarded to everyone, but this approach helps to ensure the sustained attention of the child to the application.  We can find out the minimum time for passing the game and, of course, observe with our own eyes what difficulties children have, not only with the tasks themselves, but with an understanding of the action of the function buttons. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3c1/137/6b6/3c11376b63ef674c146db7190574c25f.jpg"><br><br>  After such testing, we make some changes to the application, and the happy kids return home with gifts.  As you can see, the children are happy, and now we are calm - we know our mistakes and can correct them. <br><br>  The final verdict handed down. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5bf/995/1d8/5bf9951d8b6687db07c15b0115a5f406.jpg"><br><br>  More photos from testing you can see on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/media/set/%3Fset%3Da.212400495566297.49644.134154266724254%26type%3D1">this link</a> . <br><br>  In addition, we shot this video with the participation of small testers. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/yr17ucK3nzo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgVR4j579HQDTaGQQfiJ_nz8jL8Rw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Stay with us and we will tell you even more about our experience in developing children's mobile apps. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/169375/">https://habr.com/ru/post/169375/</a></p>
