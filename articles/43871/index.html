  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Circus left - clowns remained</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="http://www.f-1.ru/img/news/3113small.gif"><br>  Big circus "left" yesterday <a name="habracut"></a>  as the Formula 1 race is called.  You will ask a question: where is IT social network habrahabr.ru and sport (Formula 1).  I would not call Formula 1 a sport, it‚Äôs rather a competition of modern technologies.  No wonder more than half of the title and technology sponsors are directly related to the IT industry (AMD, Intel, Panasonic, CA, Philips and many others, not counting the leading automakers). <br><br>  So, what am I talking about?  About how the circus went.  Yesterday was the last race of the season in which it was decided who would become the world champion in this prestigious "circus".  Before the race of the season in Brazilian Sao Paulo, the Jose Carlos Paz Interlagos circuit, there were two main competitors left: a young black Briton Lewis Hemilton (McLaren team) and a more experienced Brazilian pilot (as the Poles say: Brazilian, Kirovets (watched on TV, Polsat Sport Exrtra) ÔÅä) Felippe Massa (Ferrari).  Hemilton was 7 points ahead of Mass in order to become a world champion, he had to finish the race not lower than 5th place.  It seems to be not such a difficult task, but the paradox is that last year was exactly the same story, but in place of Massa was the Finnish pilot Kimmi Raikonnen.  Similarly, Hamilton was 7 points ahead of Raykonnen from Ferrari, and managed to come 6th.  And lost the champion's crown.  For the entire season, both Massa and Hemilton deserved the title of champion, but only one had to get it. <br><br><img src="http://www.formula1.com/photos/597x478/manual/trenkler-2008br-sunday-11.jpg" alt="image">

      Before the start of the race, I stocked up with validol, and as it turned out for good reason.  The race began with the fact that, before its start, the famous Brazilian downpour passed, and the race was delayed for 10 minutes.  This made the heart beat only stronger ... <br>  And the start is given. <br><br><img src="http://www.formula1.com/photos/597x478/manual/trenkler-2008br-sunday-06.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  From the very beginning, the race began somehow nervously.  After the first turn, David Koulhard (Red Bull Racing) and Nelsinho Piquet (Renault) were immediately ‚Äúcarried out‚Äù.  And for the veteran of Formula 1, the last race in his career, probably ended not the way he wanted. <br><br><img src="http://www.formula1.com/photos/597x478/tvimages/2008/brazil/sunpic4.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://www.formula1.com/photos/597x478/sutton/2008/d08bra2036.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I will miss half the race, otherwise this topic will turn into a book.  I will say one thing, everything went according to the plan of Lewis Hemilton.  Although Massa rode in the first place, Lewis stayed on the "test" of the 5th, which guaranteed him the crown. <br><br>  But literally 5 laps before the finish it started to rain, which confused all the cards to the riders.  All sharply rushed into the pits "dress up" on rain tires.  Up to this point, Lewis was able to rise to 4th place. <br><br><img src="http://www.formula1.com/photos/597x478/sutton/2008/d08bra2075.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But after leaving the boxes, everything was mixed up.  It turned out not everyone went to change tires in the rain.  The Toyota team decided not to ‚Äúchange clothes‚Äù and drove in the rain with tires designed for dry weather.  It is the same as riding a summer set of rubber over the ice, on a regular car.  In principle, it is possible, but how long? <br><br><img src="http://www.formula1.com/photos/597x478/tvimages/2008/brazil/sunpic18.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Timo Glock from Toyote team "squeezed" in 4th place.  Hemilton, turned on the 5th.  On the 6th, a young, rising star of Formula 1 is a German, Sebastian Vettel from the Torro Rosso team (aka Red Bull-2), on which the engines stand ... Ferrari.  The whole group got to the "circular" racers, who were lagging behind the circle.  And here, as they say, something happened that is called "extinguish the light." <br><br><img src="http://www.formula1.com/photos/597x478/manual/trenkler-2008br-friday-24.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  For one and a half circle (!!!) to the finish, Vettel, taking advantage of Hemilton‚Äôs indecisiveness, when overtaking the circular Robert Kubica from BMW, slipped by a beautiful maneuver to 5th place!  The whole stadium first stopped in disbelief, and finally exploded!  In this "scenario" their pet (Mass) became the champion!  To overtake, in the modern formula-1, for 1 lap, is almost impossible.  So it basically was.  Hamilton tried to fight, but the car at the end of the race did not have that balance.  It is clearly inferior in speed Torro Rosso.  Lewis fans ran for validol, Massa fans shouted for joy.  Finally ... Felippe crosses the finish line first.  Stadium boils. <br><br><img src="http://www.formula1.com/photos/597x478/manual/trenkler-2008br-saturday-18.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A pair of Hemilton-Vettel is nearing the final turn.  Hamilton 6th!  And ... We all forgot about Toyota Timo Glock.  I did not write for nothing, I wrote ... how long can you swim with a pound weight?  The same happened with the pilots of Toyota - they did not go, they just swam.  And almost at the finish line a pair of young fighters Hemilton-Vettel, Toyota Glock flew in with a finishing jerk ... Vettel 4th.  Hemilton - 5th.  He becomes the 30th and youngest world champion in the Formula 1 car race.  And the tears of happiness in the eyes of Lewis, the tears of disappointment in the eyes of Felippe. <br><br><img src="http://www.formula1.com/photos/597x478/sutton/2008/d08bra2195.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I am very sorry for Felippe, he also deserved to win, but yesterday God would have liked to see Hamilton finally become the fastest Formula 1 driver this year.  In an interview with ITV, Lewis Hamilton said: ‚ÄúI can not put into words what I feel now.  We have come a long way, I am grateful to the fans for their support, the team for the fantastic work during the season, I am excited and proud that I could win this title for them. <br><br>  On the last laps the tires were seriously worn out, I tried to keep the gap from Sebastian, but could only stay ahead.  When the track got wet, I did not want to risk it, he stepped forward, and suddenly they told me on the radio that I had to return the position in order to win the title.  I could not believe it, and we immediately overtook Glock.  I can only thank God! <br><br>  Just before that, I was informed that Glock had lost speed, I attacked Vettel, and he was no slower than me, if not faster.  This is the hardest race in my career.  Crossing the finish line, I did not know that I won the title, the team confirmed this only in the first turn, and I realized that the dream had come true. <br><br><img src="http://www.formula1.com/photos/597x478/sutton/2008/d08bra2005.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I thought that the heart would not stand, probably, many had the same feelings.  I do not know what would happen if I lost everything in the last rounds.  The tires were worn away, the car was heavy with fuel, and Vettel had a fresh kit, and he played it out with every lap.  Felipe Massa had a fantastic race, I congratulate him on his well-deserved victory, we fought well this year.  But winning the championship is incredible! ‚Äù <br><br><img src="http://www.formula1.com/photos/597x478/sutton/2008/d08bra1835.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://www.formula1.com/photos/597x478/sutton/2008/d08bra2012.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  This is also a ‚Äúformula‚Äù :) <br><br>  <b>UPD: As I expected in the comments they ask: where is IT to the topic?</b> <br>  In the same way, I asked a question when articles about Formula 1 were published on IT sites that I respected: <a href="http://www.thg.ru/">thg.ru</a> <a href="http://www.ixbt.com/">ixbt.com</a> <a href="http://www.3dnews.ru/">3dnews.ru</a> <br>  Today's Formula 1 is more likely a high-tech competition in IT technology. <br>  The struggle in the financial sector (if it‚Äôs a joke, last year McLaren paid only a $ 100 million fine, and I‚Äôll keep silent about budgets) <br>  After all, not who does not raise the question of why articles about computer games or games competitions are published on habr-e ... <br>  With my article I wanted to ‚Äúhook‚Äù and arouse interest in these competitions, believe me, ‚ÄúFormula 1‚Äù is not a riding circle after lap.  All the fun behind the curtain: the struggle of technology, minds. <br>  Thanks to all the readers who supported me.  I will try in the near future to write articles on the topic :) <br>  Announcement: already almost prepared an article about new architectures in the development of CMS.  Interesting? <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/43871/">https://habr.com/ru/post/43871/</a></p>
