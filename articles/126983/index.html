  <section class="page js-page"><h1>PingWin Fax machine: all free</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Fax, how much of this sound for the heart of the Russian merged, how much it responded ... <br>  Each reader heard in the handset a signal of this device, similar either to a mosquito bass, or to the screech of a breaking escalator.  True, many have already managed to forget how to use it and from which side to insert paper, since the Internet and e-mail replaced their view from the window and other ecology.  However, there are still reserved places where the fax is used for its intended purpose.  And these places are not as few as you can think.  For example, government agencies.  And they send each other circulars, orders, instructions and other documentation from morning to evening.  So, for them, for everyone who is involved in the orbit of their influence, as well as for those who by virtue of their work cannot refuse to use paper in their work, Penguin Software has developed its new product PingWin Fax machine. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Everyone knows that the new is well forgotten old.  Well, maybe not forgotten and not quite old, but one that had never occurred to anyone before.  To whom from laziness, and to whom as superfluous.  So, being in a certain period of its history in cramped living conditions, the team ‚ÄúPenguin Software‚Äù has amassed some money and moved into large light mansions.  And everything in the new house was good: a coffee maker, air conditioners, and modern engineering infrastructure.  Only one turned out to be bad: the fax did not go.  That's when the managers remembered with a kind word their old garret with an analog telephone.  It was then that they put their technical department on the ears: ‚ÄúWe want, they say, such a service so that you can send pieces of paper in commodity quantities of several hundred pieces at a time, and that incoming documents come to your personal email box, so that a pleasant girlish voice will lead so that at the other end of the wire it was impossible to break away, and so much more could.  And if he could not, then he quickly learned it.  And they gave until the evening. <br>  And I must say that "Penguin" company is not easy.  A knowledgeable person, having read the name, will immediately understand that the matter here is not clean and free software a mile away smells.  And he will be right, a reader will be right a hundred times.  What we do, we admit: yes, we deal with free software and advise others.  Therefore, it is not good for us to use any proprietary work.  Those.  Give us the decision on the free software, so that for free, so much so that others can rejoice afterwards.  And the techies went scrape the bottom of the barrel, but revenge on the barns.  And they asked each counter-cross: did he meet a marvel?  And good people helped, yes they brought it to overseas wonders.  And they were called Asterisk, T38modem, Hylafax and Avantfax.  And the penguin techies began to think: ‚ÄúHow can we accustom these creatures so that they don‚Äôt bite each other‚Äôs heads off and leave us alive?‚Äù  And the most intelligent techie penguin said: ‚ÄúWe will caress until a file is needed.‚Äù  And right, the smoking room, turned out to be.  Caressing any beast can be tamed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/daa2d9bf/99577716/38cc6f11/77e97dd7.png"><br>  Fig.1 Interaction diagram of the components of the PingWin Fax machine solution <br><br>  Only one problem arose.  The modem, which is called T38, in contrast to the legendary Soviet tank did not want to start up.  And so it turned and that way.  And all to no purpose.  Grunting, sneezing, pyshit black exhaust, and does not want to move.  He had to do the surgery.  In general, his disease was opened, and there it was that wasn‚Äôt ponypihano.  Like in an old house in the attic: books interspersed with bicycles, libraries with jam candies.  So in these libraries, the whole thing turned out to be.  It was just necessary to systematize them in a special way, and arrange the books in the necessary order.  And the modem recovered, and made friends with the rest of the menagerie.  And they began to make such numbers together, that everyone around came to the emotion. <br>  Here and the fairy tale is over, and who has listened loudly - well done.  And as a reward he gets a pickled cucumber.
