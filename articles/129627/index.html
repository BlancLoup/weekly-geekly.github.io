      I will not retell the details here (those who wish to read it), I‚Äôll dwell only on a set of arguments and conclusions that it would be good to bear in mind before calling for help with a cry ‚ÄúI have a trace showing that ...‚Äù <br><br><blockquote><code><i>  ( )  ‚Äî    .      ,      , ,  , .  ,         .           ,    ,      .</i></code> </blockquote> <br><h4>  Some facts (without going into details) </h4><ul><li>  The delay in passing a packet through a network consists of several factors: serialization, buffering, and distribution.  Each of the factors is more complicated than you think about it. </li><li>  The delay that the tracerout shows you is even more complex: routers process packets addressed to themselves completely differently than transit packets.  This circumstance leads to the specific nature of the values ‚Äã‚Äãof delays, which are shown to us by the tracerout.  It does not follow from this that they cannot be guided, but one must be able to read them. </li><li>  Traffic on the Internet almost always goes different ways in the directions from the client to the server and from the server to the client.  The tracerout always shows the total delay in both directions, and the trace - only in one direction. </li><li>  Specifying the source address on a device with multiple interfaces (a router) does not affect the choice of interface from which requests will be sent.  It influences the choice <i>of the</i> way <i>back</i> , through which the answers are transmitted.  Their trace is not visible in the output, but in this way it is possible to measure the delay difference for parallel return routes. </li><li>  Using L3 balancing somewhere on Internet backbones is likely to force different packages to follow different paths within the same trace.  This behavior leads to a hard-to-interpret conclusion that not everyone can read correctly. </li><li>  Modern routers do not comply with the requirements of clause 4.3.2.4 of RFC1812, which obliges to set the IP address of the source of ICMP replies to the address of the outgoing interface.  Instead, they set it equal to the address of the interface to which the trace request was received (packet with TTL = 1).  However, if it were the other way around, reading the output of a trace would be much harder. </li><li>  The presence of MPLS switching within the backbone networks (now this is the case with any large provider respecting itself) leads to a counterintuitive way of transmitting responses to the tracer and even less obvious way of calculating the delays. </li></ul><br><h4>  Some of the most important findings (with my creative insight) </h4><ul><li>  Traceout is not as simple as it seems;  need to be able to use it.  And for this you need to understand how it works. </li><li>  Most administrators and engineers of operational services, not to mention ordinary users, do not understand and do not know how.  Such a situation very often leads to false alarms, misdiagnosis, etc. </li><li>  Traysroute traysroutu discord.  The standard tracert utilities in Windows and traceroute in Linux are implemented differently and can give different results.  Windows sends ICMP and Linux sends UDP, firewalls on the trace path may have different filtering settings for different protocols. </li><li>  When interpreting the results of tracing requires experience and ingenuity.  It happens that important conclusions can be made only by guessing, relying on indirect data, and others - and not at all unequivocally, but only up to "most likely". </li></ul><br><h4>  Total </h4><br><h5>  If you are a customer </h5>  Do not be bothered by technical support of providers, integrators, vendors, corporate help desk, etc., with the findings of the traceroute, unless you are absolutely sure of the answer to the question ‚Äúwhy do I interpret the trace exactly like that?‚Äù At best, you will simply be ignored or sent.  At worst - you can convince inexperienced support staff in the fairness of their wrong version, as a result of which they will go to dig the problem in a completely different place. <br><br>  If you do not see any problems with the service (everything works), but you don‚Äôt like something in the output of the trace, think carefully before you raise the alarm.  It is highly likely that you simply misinterpret the output.  Very rarely, a single trace can be judged on the existence of a problem.  And if there really is a problem, it is usually easier to demonstrate it without a trace. <br><br><h5>  If you are a performer </h5>  Never get fooled by someone else's interpretation of the traceroute output.  Think with your head (always please - your cap).  In general, if a problem report begins with a trace-time output, this is a sure sign that, before doing anything, the information stated further needs to be rechecked personally three times. <br><br>  Read the presentation of Richard.  Use caution as a basic tool for troubleshooting: it is very easy to make a mistake in interpretation, information is often not enough for definitive conclusions.  Always compare the testimony of the trace with other available data, if possible use it only as additional or draft information. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/129627/">https://habr.com/ru/post/129627/</a></p>
