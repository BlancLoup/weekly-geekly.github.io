I was proud and busy, so the conversation went wrong.  But the guy was resourceful, the second time he decided not to stand on ceremony with questions, pulled out a hunting knife, cut my throat, opened my stomach and really wanted to complete the acquaintance penetrating the heart, but my ribs and other bones hampered him every time. <br><br>  The chance to live until the next day was rapidly decreasing, because I didn‚Äôt have enough hands.  I stoked a red fountain with one, beating out of my throat, another grabbing the blade, but I still had to make sure that something did not fall out of the abdominal cavity, but tight pants somehow managed to do it. <br><br>  There would be no text here now if the neighbor did not come out for a cry for help.  Long story short, in 40 minutes I was taken to hospital with nine stab wounds, in deep hemorrhagic and painful shock.  The surgeon, four months before that had removed my inflamed appendix and had heard my complaints about the excessive length of the suture, met me warmly.  I remained conscious all the time, but when they began to cut off my clothes, I asked to ‚Äúcut down, it hurt the same.‚Äù <br><br>  Some of you have heard this story and know that I do not consider that event to be something bad.  It is not known what kind of person would live in my body now, if there were no scars on it.  I simultaneously learned to write with my left hand and not to be afraid to go out, not to wait for revenge, to let go of those who wanted to leave.  I saw the endless devotion of my family and felt the power of their love.  I was lucky to find out how friends and friends of friends come to help, how strangers donate blood, bring medicine and money to the hospital.  As a special flight, rare drugs arrive from Germany, as the nurses of the intensive care unit do not sleep for days.  In my eyes unfolded the interaction of hundreds of different people, aimed at saving the life of one, unremarkable girl. <br><br>  Rising from my bed a few weeks after the attack, for the first time I felt confidently standing on my own feet.  In all senses.  I understood what life is and accepted responsibility for how it will be.  I stopped being a victim of crime. <br><br>  Often we can do nothing with an evil will directed against us.  But this does not mean that misfortune is able to control our life and dictate its further course.  The moment of encounter with evil is hard and scary, but after it life can be surprisingly happy. <br><br>  I measured a lot of luck.  I met wonderful people, many of whom I still consider to be demigods and freeze with delight when communicating with them.  I was doing insanely interesting things.  But being dead, doing all this would be quite difficult.  This thought led me to a project whose goal ‚Äî no less ‚Äî is to make the world safer. <br><br>  My name is Katya, I am 41 years old and I am a co-founder in the Nimb project, which in a minute launches a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter. <br><br>  Nimb helps people interact with each other to help someone in need. <br><br>  If technologies are already able to put you in the fighter's cabin, without taking them off the couch, then they should definitely be used to save lives.  It sounds pathetic, but not for me and not for the authors of the letters that littered my mailbox: they contain words of gratitude and hope, and history, history, history: nurses from Philadelphia who have to return home late, fans of nightly jogging from London, diabetics, elderly people, concerned parents, and those who are confronted with evil face to face.  I always answer personally: Thank you for sharing this.  I am a crime survivor myself.  That's why i joined the project. <br><br>  Making the world safer is a tickling ambition task, but if you ask me why I‚Äôve got involved in a risky story, I have a clear answer: First, it's beautiful! <br></div></div><br><br>  The ring will be available in two colors: black and white, and not only girls can wear it.  The alert button is located on the back side so that it can be quickly found with one hand, without making unnecessary movements: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9ef/103/534/9ef103534fc84215bb0c3ec3f58da5a3.gif"><br><br>  In addition to the direct threat from any person, Nimb is addressed, for example, to those who enjoy extreme sports and risk being in a difficult situation when help is needed.  Older people could also use the gadget so that if they feel worse, they can quickly alert their relatives or doctors with one touch. <br><br>  Currently rings are priced from $ 75. <br><br>  Katya Kermlin is also known in Russia as another project: she is the co-founder of the humorous opposition account <a href="https://twitter.com/KermlinRussia">KermlinRussia</a> , which appeared on the next day of the presidency of DA Medvedev. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/395481/">https://habr.com/ru/post/395481/</a></p>
