  <section class="page js-page"><h1>13 battery startups, which are worth watching in 2013</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i><b><a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/01/14/13-battery-startups-to-watch-in-2013/">GIGAOM</a></b> spoke about 13 startups developing revolutionary battery technologies for electric vehicles, power supply systems and mobile devices.</i> <br><br>  Batteries do not usually appear on the pages of the media and are "quiet horses" that feed our phones and mobile devices and can potentially change the way that existing power supply systems and vehicles operate.  It is not a secret that innovations in this area are a complicated matter, since it takes a long time and requires considerable financial expenditures to develop and introduce a new type of accumulators everywhere. <br><br>  We want to bring to your attention several promising projects that use nanotechnology, new printing methods, super-computers and other innovations for the development of a new generation of batteries.  A bit of luck, good leadership, and perhaps a little support from governments can change our understanding of how to store and use energy.

      <b>Ambri</b> <br> <a href="http://www.ambri.com/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aa8/180/dfa/aa8180dfa8388e85b5f10e7e07e952c1.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br>  Ambri is one of the most famous projects to date, formerly called ‚ÄúLiquid Metal Battery‚Äù (Liquid Metal Batteries).  The company was founded by MIT professor Don Sadovey (Don Sadoway), the only ‚Äúbattery man‚Äù who gave an interview on the American television program The Colbert Report.  People like Bill Gates, Vinod Khosla and oil giant Total are investing in a startup.  Ambri develops batteries for power supply systems, placing molten salt between two layers of liquid metal.  The project needs at least another year and a half before commercialization. <br><br>  <b>Imprint energy</b> <br> <a href="http://www.imprintenergy.com/"><img src="http://www.imprintenergy.com/styles/images/logo.png" alt="image"></a> <br>  Using zinc instead of lithium and screen printing technology, the Imprint Energy team has developed an ultra-thin, high-energy, flexible and inexpensive battery. <br><img src="http://www.imprintenergy.com/assets/images/banner-main.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Because of these battery characteristics, the company is targeting companies that produce mobile-wearable devices (for example, Google Glass, Jawbone UP).  The company already produces small batches of its batteries for its first customers, and plans to launch full-scale production within a couple of years. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Alveo energy</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8d2/7ad/f19/8d27adf1984cd2d2b5ca6a61e849abb0.png" alt="image"><br>  Alveo Energy companies are only half a year old.  Their goal is to create and commercialize a battery made from water, Prussian blue dye (used for painting jeans and pencils, for example), iron and copper.  The battery should be ultra-cheap and durable, and, if successfully implemented, can help make a breakthrough in energy storage technology for power systems.  Research and development is conducted by Colin Wessells, an entrepreneur and graduate student at Stanford University, and Robert Huggins, a professor at Stanford University.  The company received a grant of $ 4 million from the US Department of Energy. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.pelliontech.com/"><b>Pellion</b></a> <br>  Pellion decided to look for a chemical composition for an ideal battery in an advanced way: the researchers created advanced algorithms and computer models that allowed them to test more than 10,000 potential cathode materials for perfect compatibility with the magnesium anode.  Co-founder of the company, Professor MIT Gerbrand Seder (Gerbrand Ceder), also helped to create the project "The Materials Genome" at MIT - a computer program that allows you to use virtual models to achieve innovative results in materials science.  Pellion claims that their batteries will be very energy-intensive - more energy-intensive than modern lithium-ion batteries.  The project is funded by the US ARPA-E program and Khosla Ventures. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.quantumscape.com/"><b>QuantumScape</b></a> <br>  QuantumScape is in an early stage of development and is located in Silicon Valley.  The startup was founded by co-founder and CEO of Infinera Jagdeep Singh (Jagdeep Singh) and funded by Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers and Khosla Ventures. <br><br>  <a href="http://enviasystems.com/"><b>Envia</b></a> <br>  Last year, Envia said that their lithium-ion batteries could provide electric vehicles with 300 miles (482.803) for a price ranging from $ 20,000 to $ 30,000.  The company was founded in 2007 and since then has developed an inexpensive cathode and created a cell with an anode of silicon and carbon and high-voltage electrolyte.  The company is invested by General Motors, the Japanese giant Asahi Kasei, Pangea Ventures, Redpoint Ventures and the US ARPA-E program. <br><br>  <b>Geli</b> <br> <a href="http://geli.net/"><img src="http://geli.net/img/logo-geli-header.png" alt="image"></a> <br>  The GELI project does not create new types of batteries, but it does create software and an operating system for grid batteries.  Companies, owners of buildings and premises can buy complexes running at GELI and use them to store energy for solar-powered systems, or, for example, to store and release energy in conditions where it is needed more than the main power supply can provide. . <br><br>  <b>Sila Nanotechnologies</b> <br> <a href="http://www.silanano.com/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/563/84a/c83/56384ac8371a806a3f16aae89963cb5b.gif"></a> <br>  The company was founded in 2011 in Silicon Valley in conjunction with the Georgia State University of Technology.  The company is engaged in the creation of a new type of lithium-ion batteries, which can increase the capacity of existing 2 times.  The company received a grant of 1.73 million dollars from the US government. <br><br>  <b>Boulder ionics</b> <br> <a href="http://boulderionics.com/"><img src="http://boulderionics.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/bi_logo-300x44.png" alt="image"></a> <br>  The company is engaged in battery electrolytes, in which the flow of ions between the anode and the cathode.  Cheaper electrolyte is being developed, which can work stably at high temperatures and voltages. <br><br>  <b>Prieto battery</b> <br> <a href="http://prieto.everyperspective.com/"><img src="http://prieto.everyperspective.com/wp-content/themes/prieto/images/3d-battery-demo.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br>  This startup, which is the brainchild of Professor Amy Prieto (Amy Prieto), is developing a lithium-ion battery that can charge for 5 minutes and run 5 times longer than existing ones.  The company uses nanotechnology to create copper nano-wires that make up the anode of the battery.  The electrolyte used is a solid polymer. <br><br>  <b>Sakti3</b> <br> <a href="http://www.sakti3.com/"><img src="http://www.sakti3.com/image/logosmall.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br>  A startup from the state of Michigan, which is engaged in the creation of a super-high-capacity lithium-ion battery from solid polymers.  This approach can significantly improve the safety of electric vehicles, since these batteries will not contain flammable liquids.  The startup is funded by Khosla Ventures, GM Ventures and Itochu. <br><br>  <b>Xilectric</b> <br>  The company is engaged in the improvement of ‚ÄúBattery Edison‚Äù, a traditional iron-nickel battery.  Xilectric does the accumulator from aluminum and magnesium that, according to them, will make the accumulator more capacious and less expensive.  The company received a grant of 1.73 million dollars from the US government. <br><br>  <b>Amprius</b> <br> <a href="http://www.amprius.com/"><img src="http://amprius.com/media/img/logo_w220.png" alt="image"></a> <br>  The company's developments are based on studies of Yi Cui from Stanford University, which describe batteries using nanostructured silicon anode.  This technology can reduce the anode by four times, which will significantly increase the battery capacity.  The company is funded by Trident Capital, VantagePoint Venture Partners, IPV Capital, Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, and Eric Schmidt. <br><br>  Respectfully, <br>  Mugen Power Batteries <br>  <a href="http://mugen-power-batteries.ru/">http://mugen-power-batteries.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/180665/">https://habr.com/ru/post/180665/</a></p>
