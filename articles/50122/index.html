  <section class="page js-page"><h1>One of the methods of interactive marketing, stand for discussion.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It has long been the project of this business idea, how to start your own advertising business from scratch.  Even attempts were made to appeal to potential investors.  But I myself am not an expert in advertising, so I post the project for discussion, to determine the pros and cons.  The statement is written in the form of questions and answers, the investor asks, and then comes my answer. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  The idea and concept is an advertising agency that manufactures digital photographic souvenirs for companies of their future clients, primarily at trade shows and when conducting promotions at retail outlets - these are services for businesses.  Also, the Internet is a project where these photo-souvenirs will be available for viewing, having previously answered questions (with a choice to answer or not) marketing research or simply surveys of companies that have made an order for such a service. <br><br>  What will you sell? <br>  1. Digital photographic portraits, where those who wish were photographed free of charge with interesting or rare objects, and possibly with animals or in interesting places, and the companies that ordered this service pay for these photo-souvenirs.  But at the same time, they give the client their coordinates and the address of their Internet site, through which they click on the link to get to the RA Internet project.  2. On the Internet - project the audience, viewing their photo souvenirs and answering questions of marketing research and company surveys.

      Who and where will you sell? <br>  In the venues of exhibitions and promotions, in the period of their organization, also advertising their services.  Because  Photographs are made in digital form, it is geographically possible to cover a lot. <br><br>  What will be the main income? <br>  1. Organization and production of photo souvenirs. <br>  2. Placement of registered surveys and advertising on the RA Internet project. <br>  Example: You are in a supermarket (arrived for shopping), in the same place some company carries out a promotion (as often happens).  And it does not offer you leaflets and booklets with their advertising, but take a free photo from ... (from a clown to a living monkey) or to ... (from a large stool to a golden toilet) or to ... (from a stencil with a beautiful landscape to a super car).  But you can see or download these photos only by visiting the website of this company, which conducts a promotion (for example, the link ‚ÄúYOUR PHOTO \‚Äù under the news heading), and the link leads to the RA Internet project, where it will be offered before viewing survey survey, possibly ordered by the same company. <br><br>  What is your competitive advantage? <br>  Most people are vain, so they will take the opportunity to look at their free photo, and even with interesting details on it, through the website of the company that paid for it, and for the company it is a potential client. <br><br>  What is your strategy? <br>  To occupy a certain niche of advertising services with a high percentage.  Not limited territory. <br><br>  How much do you plan to earn? <br>  The break-even point should be completed in half a year. <br><br>  Do you have a team? <br>  I would be happy to discuss the project with a good web programmer, for joint cooperation. <br>  Be clear about who the end user is - citizens or companies that carry out promotions? <br>  1. Companies - because  Citizens who have visited the site of the company to see their photo souvenir will have the opportunity to get more closely acquainted with information about the company and its products, subsequently making a call, order or purchase. <br><br>  2. Companies that placed an order for marketing research on the RA Internet project to determine their strategy in the market, considering each individual buyer to understand what leverage to use for his motivation to purchase. <br><br>  What do you mean by the concept of making digital photo souvenirs? <br>  Full cycle of work on the order - organization of such questions: when, where, with whom or with what, citizens will be invited to take a picture, the process of photographing itself, the transfer of contact information about where and how the photographic souvenir will be available for viewing, placement on the RA Internet project with the logo or trademark of the company that ordered it. <br><br>  How are the internet portal and souvenirs linked? <br>  Photo souvenirs will be in digital format, posted online, have their own identification number to search and view on the RA Internet project. <br><br>  Formulate the market, volume and forecast of demand in the context of declining advertising budgets due to the crisis <br>  The crisis makes not only count money, but also invent new ways to spend it, an unusual advertising product - it means effective advertising.  Market - companies aiming at new ideas and creative advertising (including word of mouth), which refuse mass advertising channels (TV, radio, media) in favor of less expensive ones, and also companies that change their marketing strategy from mass to individual advertising and they need research, due to the fact that the consumer has become more experienced and informed (capricious).  Volume - while the service is non-standard, growth is possible in this niche with a high percentage.  The forecast - according to some estimates, companies and brands are increasingly turning to consumers directly, including online. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/50122/">https://habr.com/ru/post/50122/</a></p>
