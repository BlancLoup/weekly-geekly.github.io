  <section class="page js-page"><h1>General field theory or what is gravity?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Finding, it seems to me, the discovery I turned to the head.  Department of Physics.  ‚ÄúLook - I have an opening !!!!‚Äù Cut me off right away - showing me the place in the list where I should be in my work, and that can be.  Well, if so, I decided, let him lie.  Why do parasites doctors and candidates produce their own hump.  But I wrote the first article on Hubbard, and I thought - let me have fun with your friends with my theory of the universe. <br>  I don‚Äôt know about you, but I always had a slight feeling of nausea about the Schr√∂dinger equation with its probability of finding an electron at a point.  And the wave dualism itself suggested that it was necessary to take a look at the radiation quantum in a different way.  And then there are Bohr's postulates - they say I decided so, because it lives like that.  I will not touch the quarks and the more invisible graviton.  So, this article is dedicated to the victims of quantum mechanics. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Since Mr Bor had the right to express his postulates, then I will begin with them.  I affirm that there are two and only two original forms of matter / energy.  They are presented in the figure below. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/83f/b65/22e/83fb6522ec27376f59827580ec216113.png"><br><br>  For convenience, we will call one of them negative, and the other positive.  These forms consist of mutually perpendicular electric and magnetic field lines of force and cannot be in kinetic rest.  Now consider the options for their sustainable existence: <br><h5>  Option 1. Quantum radiation. </h5><br>  This form has a linear velocity equal to the speed of light and directed perpendicular to the plane of the field lines of force.  In addition to this, the quantum has an angular velocity of rotation of the field lines of force along the axis of its linear motion.  The magnitude of the angular velocity determines the wavelength of the radiation.  Well, that's done with quantum-wave dualism.  The radiation quantum is shown in the figure below.

Charged particle or electron / proton </h5><br>  As I wrote above, the form of matter has no right to be in kinetic rest, but this does not at all mean only a forward movement.  Below is the form of matter, which may not have a linear velocity equal to the speed of light, but the angular velocity of at least one of the field lines of force is equal to the angular velocity of light.  The angular velocity of light is a new concept.  I will not say its numerical value - I could not calculate it, but within the framework of this hypothesis I assume that it exists.  Moreover, the rotation of the field power line with the angular velocity of light leads to the fact that the interaction of the external environment with this field force line is possible only up to a certain distance from its axis of rotation, as shown in the figure below.  The picture is given for charged particles electron and proton.  I want to immediately draw your attention to the fact that these particles are no different than the signs of their field and have only two lines of force of the magnetic and electric fields. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/92c/d89/23e/92cd8923e43fee6db38ed5195b147c3b.png"><br><br><h5>  Option 3. Neutron. </h5><br>  Immediately I will give his presentation in the figure below. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d24/07f/654/d2407f654449181d19a08011cfccbd85.png"><br>  You can see that there are two neutrons - one formed by the negative form, and the second positive.  And here there is some apparent inconsistency with the universe.  But a minute of patience. <br>  Before turning to the neutron, one will have to digress to what is the force of gravity and, in accordance with it, the measured value of the attraction of bodies. <br>  Let's draw a classic atomic model in which electrons revolve around a nucleus.  As we know, such rotation of charged particles generates a magnetic field, which is actually drawn in the figure below.  At the same time, the magnetic field lines are closed on themselves, but there is always a non-zero area that these lines of force will cross.  This area is shaded in the figure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dde/de2/fa9/ddede2fa9d244657005183fbe762bc4b.png"><br>  For ease of understanding further, let us state it differently - any atom has a single non-closed magnetic field line extending to infinity and passing through its center.  A ‚Äúhedgehog‚Äù of such lines of force of different directions emerges from the surface of a solid body.  As shown in the picture below. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/537/99c/a12/53799ca12af93e38bbf25175a730465b.png"><br><br>  The unlocked magnetic field lines of various bodies that are nearby ‚Äúlook for‚Äù their pairs and attract bodies.  This force is gravitational attraction.  Those.  nothing more than a magnetic field formed by the movement of charged particles in atoms of matter.  Thus, three main characteristics of gravitational attraction are realized. <br><ol><li>  All bodies are only attracted </li><li>  The force of attraction is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the bodies. </li><li>  The force of attraction is directly proportional to the number and size of atoms that make up these bodies. </li></ol><br>  Well, for the most inquisitive minds I describe an experiment that claimed to be discovered.  Friends, just weigh the magnet on non-metallic scales and in the absence of ferromagnets.  The thing is that in a normal, non-magnetized body, the magnetic lines of force extend uniformly in all directions.  But the magnet distribution is different - at the poles more, and less along them.  And the attraction to the Earth, with its magnetic lines, is different.  And so much so that otherwise this difference cannot be explained.  And the interaction with the magnetic field of the Earth, though there is, but not so significant.  Moreover, the figures in Israel, close to the equator and in Moscow, are far from it are not much different. <br>  Now back to our neutron.  I think it is already clear why he has a mass.  After all, he has the same magnetic line of force, like those that come out of the surface of bodies.  But why are there two of them and who among them is our usual neutron.  Here I have to make one more postulate, or rather a series of laws for elementary energies: <br><ul><li>  The electric field lines of the same name are repelled regardless of their direction. </li><li>  The opposite electric field lines attract each other regardless of their direction. </li><li>  The magnetic field lines of the same name attract each other if their directions coincide and repel if their directions are opposite. </li><li>  The opposite magnetic field lines repel regardless of direction. </li></ul><br>  We live in a world where electrons rotate in atomic orbits and create negative magnetic fields.  That is why new atoms are formed on the same principle, and not because a proton is heavier than an electron.  In the same way, in our world, a neutron with positive lines of force cannot exist - it will be antimatter for our world and will be pushed out.  Instead of attraction to our bodies, he will push off from them. <br>  Let us now consider why electrons do not "fall" on protons in the nuclei of atoms.  This is what Bohr's postulates were made up for.  Everything is pretty banal, in terms of the concept presented.  At the beginning of the formation of an atom, when the lines of force of the electric fields of the positive and negative elements of matter meet and begin to attract, an element with negative lines of force begins to rotate around an element with positive lines of force.  This is prompted by the presence of an external magnetic field of negative magnitude.  But as they get closer, this pair itself generates magnetic field lines.  And as soon as the magnitude of the magnetic generated force field exceeds the value of the surrounding field, the external field stops the further growth of this field, preventing the electron from ‚Äúfalling‚Äù onto the proton.  One of the reasons for the absence of gas in space is precisely this - gas atoms, in the absence of an external suppressive magnetic field, are transferred to radiation quanta, due to the "fall" of electrons on protons.  The same happens on planets - black holes, where the mass is constantly growing and, accordingly, the distance between the electron and the proton all the time decreases.  There also comes a moment when the elementary particles fall on each other, returning to their independent form - the radiation quantum.  Which is a supernova. <br><br>  To your attention, I want to present another possible sustainable form of the ‚Äúlife‚Äù of elementary energy, when both the electric and magnetic lines of force rotate in the same plane with the angular velocity of light.  Such a particle looks to an external observer, as having neither charge nor mass. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c0c/933/04c/c0c93304cfcf4ae66627a594b9c85075.png"><br>  Well, my friends and everything for the first time, if you are interested, I will continue my fabrications in the future. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288312/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288312/</a></p>
