      The network, as always, is full of experts who live on the forums, replies, and mail.ru and other authoritative for many sites, who to a certain extent claim, however, without referring to anything, that sleeping in headphones is harmful. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/1e8/4a5/f76/1e84a5f76fbb4b3588a27231f4c2267a.png"><br><br>  It is important to note here that most of the conclusions are given through the introductory ‚ÄúI think‚Äù and its derivatives: ‚Äúit seems‚Äù, ‚ÄúI believe‚Äù and so on.  Our local analogue of Quora (where, by the way, was also <a href="https://www.quora.com/Is-sleeping-with-headphones-dangerous">asked a</a> similar question), The Questions, where it was customary to look for answers to all questions, <a href="https://thequestion.ru/questions/108771/vredno-li-zasypat-s-naushnikami-v-ushakh-muzyka-mozhet-igrat-do-utra">also</a> did not bypass the topic and appear almost on the first line of the search engine: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/65a/fb2/842/65afb2842cb847c2b4da1e6c174a7f82.png"><br><br>  And again, ‚ÄúI think, yes, certainly, it is harmful‚Äù and ‚Äúit will definitely be a big minus‚Äù.  Unpersuasive, but categorically. <br><br>  In 2016, a note was <a href="http://moskovskaya-medicina.ru/novosti-mediciny/son-40-podrostkov-zasypayut-v-naushnikah.html">published</a> in Russian on the Moscow Medicine portal, where you can also read without reference to the research: <br><blockquote>  Listening to music before bed can be detrimental to the quality of sleep. <br><br>  None of the studies have yet analyzed the effect of this habit of falling asleep in headphones, but recent studies have shown that using headphones during sleep can disrupt sleep through changing cycles and thus lowering the quality of sleep. </blockquote><br>  <b>Harmful vs safe</b> <br><br>  The main problem with the answer to this question is probably related to the substitution of concepts: indeed, there is reason to believe that it is not safe to sleep in headphones for a number of reasons.  Even in Western forums, in the "question-answer" mode, doctors <a href="https://admin.htap.us/user_questions/1012726-is-it-safe-to-sleep-with-headphones-on">make</a> the same mistake, confuse the harm and potential danger associated with the fact that a person can listen to a fire alarm or a gas leak sensor. <br><br>  It is what it is.  You can strangle the wire, you can listen to the alarm, thieves, murderers.  There were absolutely trash cases ( <a href="http://paparazzija.com/girl-burnt-in-her-sleep-by-headphone-connected-to-charging-phone/">Caution</a> ), however all of them are in the category ‚Äúdanger to life and health due to closed ears‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>What is meant by bad?</b> <br><br>  In this regard, the question has matured, and what is meant by "it is harmful to sleep in headphones."  Probably, we should answer that this should be interpreted as an immediate damage to the organs of hearing caused by the headphones during sleep. <br><br>  And here, too, some difficulties will arise, because the harm from headphones is a seemingly obvious thing.  But nowhere is there conclusive evidence that, falling asleep with headphones, this harm is done ‚Äúbetter‚Äù. <br><br>  Yes, listening to music in headphones can negatively affect the organs of hearing, which is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5501022/">proven</a> and obvious.  However, not only the noise in the headphones, but the noise in general is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4918662/">a destructive thing</a> .  Hearing will deteriorate faster or slower, according to research, it will inevitably happen anyway.  But in this sense, it turns out that headphones, such bastards, are equally dangerous not only at night, but also during the day. <br><br>  <b>Music for sleep</b> <br><br>  The influence of music on the body seems to be proven.  Moreover, it can <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D1%2583%25D0%25B7%25D1%258B%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">heal</a> and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2598%25D0%25BD%25D1%2584%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B2%25D1%2583%25D0%25BA">kill</a> . <br><br>  It is difficult to talk about music therapy, of course.  However, there are some indirect indications that sleeping music does exist.  It is necessary to understand this in such a way that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11191043">some</a> frequencies tune a person to a certain way, contribute to relaxation, relaxation, which facilitates the process of falling asleep. <br><br>  At the already mentioned forum in a concise form, doctors also <a href="https://admin.htap.us/user_questions/1332268-is-listening-to-music-while-going-to-sleep-good-and-also-are-binary-waves-good-to-listen-to-while-t">tend</a> to this.  And in more detailed <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4028660/">studies</a> one can come to the conclusion that music helps in this way: by reducing pain in fibromyalgia, which provoke insomnia, it helps the patient to fall asleep.  Or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4253375/">as a prophylaxis of</a> the same insomnia - with post-traumatic stress disorder. <br><br>  At the same time, it is worth noting that no specific indication of how to listen to music, with headphones or not, is not necessary.  The influence of relaxing classical music has a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18426457">positive</a> effect on the sleep of students, and again - with headphones or not? <br><br>  The <a href="https://www.thesleepjudge.com/is-it-bad-to-fall-asleep-to-music/">author's material</a> lists some problems that may arise when using headphones.  Among the dangers of suffocation already mentioned, an obstructed reaction to an alarm, skin necrosis is noted, for example, however, with reference to a women's magazine.  In this case we are talking about the type of headphones "gag".  It is noteworthy that, as an alternative and safe way to listen, the same author brings just headbands, SleepPhones as well. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/84e/ef8/06f/84eef806f24547ddb0ccb432f2551221.png"><br><br>  <b>In other words</b> <br><br>  As a result, summing up, in fact, to the question, it is necessary to note that: <br><br><ul><li>  Headphones during sleep can be dangerous, but harm to health, for the hearing aid is unproven. </li><li>  Harm to hearing from the use of headphones at night and during the day is equivalent. </li><li>  Music can be recommended as a non-pharmacological remedy to facilitate sleep immersion. </li><li>  It is possible to listen to it, probably, both in headphones, and without them - the advantage of headphones is that it will not disturb others. </li></ul><br>  In connection with this question, how do you think? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/373739/">https://habr.com/ru/post/373739/</a></p>
