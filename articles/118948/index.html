It has been taking place since 2006 in Lviv, and young people interested in information technology, computers and everything connected with it come from all over Ukraine.  IT festival?  But what is it?  From my own student experience, I can well present the festival by ‚ÄúWhat?  Where?  When? ‚Äù, KVN or some kind of student song.  And then - IT!  What kind of miracle is this?  I decided to look - and looked. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4a9/54c/676/4a954c67643135114ccf902398ea5cbf.jpg" alt="de: coded"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  There is a direct flight from Moscow to Lviv.  True, the ATR-72 turboprop flies there, which slightly increases the time in the air and enhances the impression.  Yet, when a pair of propellers spin under the wings, the impressions of the flight and - especially - the landings are more ‚Äúanalog‚Äù.  Also, the propellers transmit a noticeable vibration to the hull, so lovers of throat singing can easily achieve interesting effects to the delight of other passengers.

      Three hours - and we are in Lviv.  The airport is located within the city, and to the center from it is only about six kilometers.  Typical high-rises from Soviet times are quickly replaced by very beautiful old buildings, and instead of asphalt, paving stones appear under the wheels covering virtually all roads in the city center.  It looks very beautiful, but motorists complain about the short life of the suspension of iron horses, and fashionable women in heels have a hard time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ed2/e87/5fb/ed2e875fb43102208640d126cf0ed53e.jpg" alt="de: coded"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e45/6a4/4b5/e456a44b5159f39874b8a4bfd7d35a25.jpg" alt="de: coded"><br><br>  The <a href="http://www.decoded.org.ua/rus/">de: coded</a> festival took place in the Lviv Palace of Arts, a new building on Copernicus Street, built next to the famous Potocki Palace.  Dmitry Oganezov and I flew in on May 5, while the festival was supposed to start only the sixth.  Intel is the technology partner of the ‚Äúde: coded‚Äù movement, and because of this we managed to get inside before other guests.  To say that the work was in full swing means to say nothing: the guys at once created two huge floors at Stakhanov's pace, organizing jobs for hundreds of participants, erecting a stage, demo zone and a podium for a DJ. <br><br>  Downstairs equipped places to sleep: many de: coded guests arrived from afar with their sleeping bags.  Particularly large-scale works were deployed to provide wired Internet access: WiFi, of course, was also present, but many participants arrived with their stationary computers under their arms.  As far as I understand, it was impossible to predict in advance the number of systems without WiFi, so the organizers made the heroic decision to conduct Ethernet everywhere.  The network was led through the air, tying wires to the previously stretched ropes.  Sometimes hubs also hung in the air, which gave the design a special elegance. <br><br>  We left the Palace of Arts at about eight in the evening, and at that time the volumes of the unfinished were impressive.  However, the organizers assured us that no one will go to bed until everything is ready for the start of the festival.  And really - when we returned the next morning, the deficiencies came across only in very secluded corners.  There were still relatively few guests and participants, but the Intel booth was already deployed in the demo zone, where you could touch mobile computers on modern versions of processors, including the Sandy Bridge family, talk with Intel product trainers from the Ukrainian office, and get materials for developers Software that considers it important to optimize their products to work effectively on all Intel solutions.  They also showed wireless video transmission WiDi, which in the Lviv Palace of Arts ‚Äúpunched‚Äù for a good 25 meters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/981/367/23f/98136723f88d82b7995df8e623837cd5.jpg" alt="de: coded"><br><br>  Say, will not be enough?  Yes and no.  Of course, but with world-class trade shows, Intel is expanding its stands more powerful.  But in this case it was important for the young guys not only to look at meganows, but to better understand what benefits new technologies will bring in practice?  During the round table, which was conducted by Dmitry Oganezov, a small survey was conducted, which showed, let's say, a low degree of penetration into the masses in the field of Core i3 / i5 / i7 processors.  Many have Core 2 Duo / Quad and Atom, but they are still looking at the new generation.  And then they will show and tell, and the software will be advised to solve the specific tasks.  Those wishing to see and listen to recruited decently. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/48b/b04/1b8/48bb041b85d2def205f3fe5cdea0581f.jpg" alt="de: coded"><br>  <i>Who knows, maybe these guys who looked at de: coded, the future Steve Jobs, Linus Torvalds and Steve Ballmer?</i> <br><br>  Next to Intel, there are also Asus, Kingston, Facebook stands and a few other smaller companies.  Interestingly, Facebook delegated to Lviv an impressive looking recruiter who interrogated the audience - were they programmers and immediately offered to go to work in sunny California.  I do not know how many Ukrainians she recruited, but the approach is funny. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f55/703/52b/f5570352bfcfa1a539e38f172cbf6150.jpg" alt="de: coded"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/695/f94/8ce/695f948ce423ab1ca40dfe0bf2e882fd.jpg" alt="de: coded"><br><br>  The official opening of the festival was scheduled for 18-00, but then for technical reasons, it moved to 21-00.  Nevertheless, the people did not miss and with might and main prepared for numerous competitions.  Their full list can be viewed <a href="http://www.decoded.org.ua/rus/docs/decoded_schedule_2011_ru.pdf">in the official de: coded program</a> , and I will list only a few: <br><br><ol><li>  - "Such an attractive iron" </li><li>  - "Music Competition from Intel" </li><li>  - Drawing up the keyboard </li><li>  - Mouse throwing </li><li>  - Riveting connectors </li><li>  - Shuttle run with keyboard and monitor </li></ol><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2c5/448/001/2c5448001c229aacc3dde9f611c5b375.jpg" alt="de: coded"><br><br>  Of course, there were traditional competitions in FIFA, CS and other games, exemplary acceleration of iron by aces, followed by giving everyone the opportunity to repeat their success (it was fun with liquid nitrogen!), Seminars from Intel, Adobe, Asus, Google, Facebook ... You know, I am not inclined to idealize the festival ‚Äúde: coded‚Äù: probably, there are more awesome shows in world capitals and more order (‚Äúan element of a healthy mess‚Äù, if you use the terminology of Boris Grebenshchikov, was present in abundance). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e27/1d3/a7e/e271d3a7edfa8d40500bfc647896f7b2.jpg" alt="de: coded"><br>  <i>In this store, located not far from the Palace of Arts, computers clearly began selling before the revolution!</i> <br><br>  But, on the other hand, the guys almost on full enthusiasm organized a three-day festival, came up with a powerful program, brought representatives of large companies to Lviv, and the sponsors did not bring down herds - they themselves looked for, explained, convinced.  And it turned out a real IT-holiday, not only entertaining, but also giving a lot of food for the mind.  And this is not in the capital of Ukraine, but simply in one of the largest cities.  Are there any enthusiasts in Vologda, Astrakhan, Saratov, Krasnoyarsk, Tambov?  Personally, I didn‚Äôt have to hear about those, and in this case I would be glad to be unfamiliar ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2f4/c71/3fc/2f4c713fc9fb7880ee98ac83ba98453f.jpg" alt="de: coded"><br><br>  Before starting his seminars, Dmitry Oganezov was a little worried.  Especially before the first, which took place on the evening of the sixth of May.  Nevertheless, the first day of the festival is not a day off - well, how many people who want to hear about Intel‚Äôs programs for developers will be too little?  But no - there were so many guys that there were not even enough comfortable ottomans for everyone, I had to drag a few chairs away from unoccupied jobs.  That evening, Dmitry talked about the Intel Software and Services Group, <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/">about the Russian part of the Intel¬Æ Software Network</a> , about tools for developers, blogs, and then turned to competitions for developers. <br><br>  First of all, this is the <a href="http://cross.decoded.org.ua/about/">cross: coded competition of applications for netbooks based on Intel Atom processors</a> , conducted jointly with the ‚Äúde: coded‚Äù movement.  The task of the contestants is to write an application that expands the usual functions of netbooks and opens up new opportunities for their users.  The participants who took the first three places were awarded tablet PCs at Atom right at the festival.  By the way, here are the winners: Ivan Rudy, Mikhail Bobusky and Eugene, whose name the organizers soon promised to send us :).  The stock of tablets in the warehouse still remained, so it was announced the extension of the competition until mid-August. <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> : Here are our winners: Ivan Rudy, Mikhail Bobusky and Yevgeny Soroka. <br><br>  Another equally important competition is the 2011 Threading Challenge, the winners of which will go to the IDF in San Francisco.  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/117998/">We have already read about it with you</a> , but many of the guys from Ukraine, who have not yet hooked on Habr, were interested to listen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d9f/cce/5cd/d9fcce5cd03b7fb7af7ccd9bcdb0acf4.jpg" alt="de: coded"><br><br>  Of course, Dmitry also mentioned the <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/articles/iadp-challenge-details-3/">international AppUp developer challenge with its megaprips</a> .  The guys in the audience heard about him and were actively interested in - it is better to take a flight on a fighter, or all the same money.  Yet $ 50,000 is a considerable amount, in the same Lviv you can buy a small office for a future software company ... At the final of the round table, a television link with Dmitry <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/terror/" class="user_link">Terror</a> Ryzhkov, who was at that time in far Tolyatti, was told, who told about his victories in contests Intel, and that everything is fair.  And the fact that during a teleconference a specially trained technician constructed a projector mount, which made the picture merrily skip the rather large wall of the Palace of Arts, it even added a certain charm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/670/870/8ef/6708708efa751da162f23e784d57d01c.jpg" alt="de: coded"><br><br>  The next day, at 10 am, Dmitry already spoke in detail about AppUp, MeeGo and the development of applications running simultaneously on several platforms.  The tablet walked along the rows on MeeGo, and Dmitry spoke with the guys in some kind of his own language, which was difficult for me, but they felt very comfortable.  Nevertheless, even my modest knowledge of the subject was enough to appreciate the beauty of the idea: you can download applications written in C / C ++, Adobe AIR, Java and .NET in AppUp, and they will work on netbooks and tablets , and on other Atom devices, like upcoming smartphones.  There is a reservation that for such a cross-platform you need to follow a number of rules, but the latter are clearly formulated and quite logical. <br><br>  On May 7, Lviv began celebrating the city day, plus on the evening of Saturday a Dynamo (Kiev) football match took place with local Karpaty.  No, this is not a quote from another post :) It‚Äôs just that the above has dramatically increased the number of guests from Moscow who want to fly the next day, on the eighth of May.  This, in turn, caused a total shortage of tickets, and we had to take them for the seventh.  So, I almost stayed in Lviv until the ninth, because there was nothing left before the plane, but Dmitry continued to ask questions, and he, accordingly, continued to answer them ‚Äî entertaining and detailed.  I will not go into the details (it is still scary!), But having stood in a small traffic jam caused by the festive overlap of the streets, we still managed to get to the airport, having checked in for the last but one flight.  To be honest, I didn‚Äôt want to fly away: the festival was gaining momentum in front of us, and it seemed to us that we wouldn‚Äôt see the most interesting things.  Most likely, it was. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/192/9b6/5cb/1929b65cba815a908a397e82d689613a.jpg" alt="de: coded"><br>  <i>How can you guess that they go for de: coded?</i> <br><br>  Do you know what else pleased de: coded?  Girls!  They, of course, were noticeably smaller than the guys, but you can not call a depressing proportion either.  In addition, the girls were not good at it-shny.  How great it is that our boring for most women craft doing such pleasant exceptions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5cf/99e/4eb/5cf99e4eb4e80212f56d134180f08dcf.jpg" alt="de: coded"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f3d/69c/eed/f3d69ceedcb969b0d387f2d9ad0a163f.jpg" alt="de: coded"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/16d/492/555/16d4925552c63f1c25f85f5c2e8a33c4.jpg" alt="de: coded"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/60d/075/288/60d075288030816c65e45d2f0f65446c.jpg" alt="de: coded"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5f4/ac6/670/5f4ac667010780760a3b4e31be9feaf9.jpg" alt="de: coded"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9bf/524/bbe/9bf524bbeadc151bee2ffc3386d98d65.jpg" alt="de: coded"><br><br>  Many of us go to Kyiv and its surroundings on the May holidays to look at flowering chestnuts, sit in inexpensive cafes with fine cuisine, enjoy the sights.  So all this in Lviv is in abundance.  Maybe for a change, next year we will meet at ‚Äúde: coded‚Äù? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ccd/7bf/772/ccd7bf7726d52be0eba0130d2e8d6e92.jpg" alt="de: coded"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/118948/">https://habr.com/ru/post/118948/</a></p>
