A competent search engine promotion strategy guarantees a minimum price for a visitor. <br><br>  In the battle for the client, every major online store tries to hire a search marketing guru.

      In the battle for customers, every major online store is trying to hire a search marketing guru.  The level of wages of people with real achievements in this area is very high.  If the promotion budget is n million rubles a month, it is better to hire an expensive and experienced person at once, rather than letting the newcomer throw away some of these millions to gain experience.  However, SEO is not a rocket science, but a complex of standard techniques that any normal person can learn to practice.  It is difficult to promote OZON, it is quite easy to promote a small online store, especially using the right tools. <br><br>  In this article, we will not describe in detail the allocation of the budget, the definition of the target audience, the calculation of the maximum profitable price per click, the analytics system, etc.  marketing issues, and try to focus on the technical aspects of SEO for e-commerce. <br><br><h5>  Special features </h5><br>  Since  The online store usually offers a wide range of products, and it is convenient and profitable to focus on promoting the collection of traffic from low-frequency key phrases. <br><br><blockquote>  Example: if you reach the top ten of ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù at the request of ‚Äúirons‚Äù, you can receive 1000 transitions and 15 purchases.  If you stand in the top for about a hundred more specific and cheap in promoting queries like ‚Äúiron Tefal fv5378‚Äù for about the same money, you can get 5000 transitions and 50 purchases.  The numbers are conditional, but the logic is clear. </blockquote><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To work with a large number of LF keywords, it is necessary to optimize many pages (goods and product groups), and also use internal linking to transfer the weight collected by the site (authority, PR, TC, etc. conditional parameters) to the promoted pages.  Competent re-linking can significantly reduce the reference budget, since  the internal link is not much different from the external one - if, of course, the donor pages themselves have already managed to gain weight from the outside. <br><br><h5>  Preliminary preparation - compilation of semantic core </h5><br>  We will not dwell on the preparatory stages, as  they are very much dependent on a particular online store, and the Habr audience can independently distinguish a transactional request (the visitor is aimed at buying) from the information one (the visitor wants to know something).  As for the tools of the preparatory stage, to compile a list of keywords for promotion (semantic core), it is most convenient to use the built-in SeoPult pick-up.  He takes statistics from Yandex.Direct, compares with his own data, and shows not only the frequency of the keyword, but also the likely number of transitions within the target tops.  This is a free tool, it can be freely used after registering with SeoPult. <br><br><img height="267.73835920177385" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cba/3bc/ddb/cba3bcddb9d195728d0708c2f211ed07.png" width="700"><br><br>  You can also use the standard <a href="http://wordstat.yandex.ru/">http://wordstat.yandex.ru/</a> .  In this case, you should actively use the morphology shutdown operator - quotes and an exclamation mark. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/890/db4/635/890db46359f1019e684a17462452303f.jpg"><br><br>  It is also necessary to check every request for compliance with the online store's assortment: for example, a super-high-frequency and expensive ‚Äúdoor‚Äù query (without quotes) is unprofitable if you only trade interior doors.  In the overwhelming majority of cases, more accurate and transactional requests give higher quality and conversion traffic, and they move cheaper and faster.  And if the online store is new and does not have a history of advancement in its subject matter, there is no need to rush into buying top links at the top in general - see our article <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/seopult/blog/169263/">‚ÄúHow to promote a new website?‚Äù</a> . <br><br><h5>  Sequencing </h5><br>  From the very beginning, you need to create and optimize pages for high-frequency queries, but you should not immediately buy links to them.  A new site or a site without promotion history should be brought up gradually: first low frequencies, then MF, and when the MF starts to hit the top ten fairly easily, then it will be possible to begin promotion on high-frequency and highly competitive keywords. <br>  Immediately it should be stipulated that one page can be promoted by 1-2 HF requests (rather, even one at a time), 5-6 MF and 5-10 LF.  That is, if you need to advance on 10 RF requests, you will have to do, optimize and promote 10 pages. <br><br>  Preparation for the promotion of links consists of internal optimization (mostly about it and will be discussed below) and build trust - search engines confidence in the site. <br><br><blockquote>  To increase the degree of trust in the promoted online store, you need to pay attention to posting articles (manually or through <a href="http://webartex.ru/">WebArtex exchanges</a> , try to register with Yandex.Catalogue and DMOZ, get links from posts in good popular blogs, install social buttons and achieve some This is the number of likes. For online stores, viral advertising campaigns are relevant - if such a chip fires, a qualitative and heterogeneous reference mass will surely arise. In general, a trust is needed to overcome the sandbox, speed up  I am ‚Äúgrowing up‚Äù of the site, eliminating suspicion of manipulation of ranking factors on the part of search engines, as well as clearing the way to the top by highly competitive keywords. </blockquote><br><br><h5>  Internal optimization </h5><br>  Optimization of an online store is to a great extent the optimization of hundreds and thousands of product cards. <br>  So, product card page. <br><br><ul><li>  Block layout was de facto the standard. </li><li>  Title and description should be different, unique for each item card, readable and informative, and also have keywords in them. </li><li>  There must be an H1 header, which includes the keyword phrase by which the page is promoted (that is, the name of the product).  In the headings of the following levels of nesting, you should also use a keyword: not ‚ÄúTestimonials‚Äù, but ‚ÄúTestimonials for the Tefal fv5378 iron‚Äù. </li><li>  Optimized text - original content with several occurrences of the keyword (by quantity and percentage of density, you should focus on the current leading competitors).  If the product description must repeat the description from the manufacturer's website word by word, go around it - add your reviews, reviews, etc. </li><li>  Pictures with the alt attribute, where the keyword is also written.  It is highly desirable to use not "taken" from the Internet or even the manufacturer's website, but your own photos (if you can make high-quality images that will not reduce the conversion). </li><li>  Links to additional or similar products. </li><li>  Reviews, reviews, video. </li></ul><br><br>  All information that is not related to the product, all duplicate content (for example, pieces of descriptions of related products), etc., should be closed from indexing.  The search robot should see clean and neatly laid out original content about the product.  Content reviews and reviews should also be original. <br><br>  Since there are thousands of product cards, the process of filling them should be automated to the maximum.  You can automatically insert the name of the product in the tags and meta tags for specific templates, select a keyword 1-2 times with a strong tag, etc.  Modern CMS have the appropriate functions, but this does not mean that there will not be manual work, you need to be ready for it. <br><br><blockquote>  If the erroneous spelling of the product name has a frequency (according to ‚ÄúYandex.Direct‚Äù) - for example, Roventa / Rowenta - the keyword with an error can also be inserted once into the content of the product card.  Traffic is superfluous. </blockquote><br><br>  Detailed information on linking can be found <a href="http://seopult.ru/subscribe.html%3Fid%3D142">in our article</a> , and to promote an online store for low-frequency queries, this scheme is relevant (the weight is transferred from higher level pages to lower level pages, and those form a ring with links to additional products): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/945/927/98b/94592798b7b748776887971b20a55183.png"><br><br>  In the transition to the promotion of MF and HF scheme will need to be changed as described in the article at the link above.  The pages of goods by this time will already acquire the incoming reference mass, so they will not lose much in positions. <br><br><h5>  Buying links </h5><br>  Knowing the whole kitchen of buying links from the inside, we cannot recommend anything for the purchase of the main part of the reference mass, except for our integrated solution SeoPult (and not only because it is our blog).  Yes, you can always try to get links from popular trust sites, manually post press releases, paid and free articles in the media - but the basis of modern promotion of online stores are very large arrays of purchased links.  They can only be found on reference exchanges, and SeoPult provides transparent and powerful tools for working with them: from automatic generation of unique anchor links to replacing donors that have lost their effectiveness with new ones.  Unique algorithms provide pre-filtering of sites, optimal purchasing dynamics, determine the real budget based on competitor analysis, select the most effective donors for a specific recipient (page promoted) according to hundreds of parameters based on analysis of the current situation in the top by promoted request, etc.  Free yourself from the frantic routine of fiddling with exchanges - if you don‚Äôt have your own procurement algorithms, it will also be expensive blindfudging.  Instead, take the time to search for the trust sites missing on the exchanges, get free links, and analyze the advertising campaign. <br><br><h5>  Analytics </h5><br>  Remove words that are in the TOP, but do not bring transitions.  Remove the words for which the transitions were, but the price per click turned out to be higher than it is profitable for you.  Remove words that have a lot of transitions, but no conversions.  Above the statistics you need to think long and seriously - this will at least allow you to save very well. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/191130/">https://habr.com/ru/post/191130/</a></p>
