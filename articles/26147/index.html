  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to solve IT problems? (Question)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The story began with the fact that the head of the IT department of a small production company (about 130 people) drew attention to the adware that had fallen into the mailbox of specialized software for monitoring and logging user actions.  A discussion ensued. <br>  On the one hand problems: <br>  1. employees noticeably spend time surfing the Internet; <br>  2. managers who have administrative rights to their laptops, which they often take home, often put all kinds of toys on them, and also bring viruses to work; <br><br>  On the other hand, morality and unwillingness to become hated by all employees of the company. <br>  Of course, problems can be solved in different ways: filter Internet traffic on the gateway (blacklist sites and block ICQ), perform compulsory checks on managers' laptops for viruses and regularly clean the installed software, but the question is not how to do it, but , what exactly. <br><br>  First, surf the net.  Yes, Fishki.net and Avto.ru who are catching up with a lot of traffic and not related to the work of any side, to prohibit.  But the same Bashorg, Habrahabr in this plan is much more harmless.  And what about VKontakte, ban or leave?  It is clear that talking there is not at work, but, damn, we must face the truth: a person can not work every day for 8 hours, allotted by law.  He needs to be distracted and as soon as all possible paths are blocked, there will be a decrease in working capacity, a more intense atmosphere, and in general all the conditions for finding another job.  But cadres are the main thing.

      Games.  Yes, if the employee knows that at any moment IT'shnik can peep at what is happening on the screen or see the fact of launching the game by the logs, he is unlikely to play during working hours, but this is the same unfavorable atmosphere.  Maybe I‚Äôm waiting for a letter from my beloved and to know that someone else will read it with you is not the most pleasant thing.  Well, do not rip out the same network cable every such time.  On the other hand, this, of course, must be somehow prohibited. <br><br>  I do not believe that by limiting the user in everything and leaving him only the ‚Äúcorridor‚Äù of his official duties, it is possible to achieve any good results.  All people are different.  Someone can not work until 10 am, but is delayed and copes with work, doing everything on time.  Why not give him the opportunity these two morning hours to read his mail and Habr?  He will love the company in which he works, for such a manifestation of loyalty.  Will become the same?  And in general, IMHO, he will endure a cut in his abilities only at exorbitant salary, and it will be precisely commodity-money relations.  And you want something like Google =) <br><br>  How do you solve these problems?  In fact, I would like to look at the question from all sides and solve something at least for myself. <br>  Thankful in advance for efficient answers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/26147/">https://habr.com/ru/post/26147/</a></p>
