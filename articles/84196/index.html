  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Jump from the stratosphere</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I remember about the project of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/i_am_clever/54901/">Spanish schoolchildren</a> who launched a balloon with a camera that captured the earth from space at an altitude of 10,000 meters.  Photos are truly gorgeous.  But how about to go there yourself and jump back to the ground?  Yes, just jump! <br>  Here is a touching video about this project: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/PyGmTV0q2kY&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhexoxEb2s3QnmF95kfvvuK_R4FzA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This is dedicated to the project Red Bull Stratos, which starts this year. <br>  The project aims to break the record of Joe Kittinger, which was set on August 16, 1960.  Joe set several records at once: the height of the climb on the stratosphere (25,816 m), the height and duration of the jump on the braking (stabilizing) parachute and the greatest speed of a person to descend in the atmosphere developed without using a vehicle. <br><br>  On January 22, 2010, Felix Baumgartner announced his project, which will be a major breakthrough in the exploration of human capabilities in aerospace.  Felix will make an attempt to become the first person to overcome the speed of sound with his own body.  Being in a capsule, with the help of a helium balloon, Baumgartner is going to rise to the upper layers of the stratosphere to a height of at least 36,576 meters.

    <h4>  <b>About danger</b> </h4><br><br>  In the 50-60 th years, new high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft were developed from the USSR Yak-25 RV, from the USA U-2. <br>  In this regard, it was required to test equipment for rescue systems, which were supposed to equip high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft. <br><br><h5>  <b>Volga</b> </h5><br>  In the USSR, the start of the Volga apparatus with two testers (Yevgeny Andreev and Pyotr Dolgov) on board.  Andreev jumped from a height of 25,458 m. The tester was allowed to open the parachute only 800 m from the ground!  This jump was successful. <br><br>  But Dolgov left the stratostat at a height of 28,640 meters, the parachute was supposed to open immediately.  Unfortunately, a dead body has fallen on the ground.  Either because of the swinging of the gondola at a high altitude, or because of the impact of the protruding object in the test tester‚Äôs headmask, a crack no longer than 9 mm long was formed.  Apparently Dolgov was conscious, pulled out a knife and tried to cut off the parachute lines so that he could quickly reach heights rich in oxygen.  I did not have time, suffocated. <br><br><h5>  <b>In the US, the project Excelsior</b> </h5><br>  As part of this project, Joseph Kittinger made three jumps with stratostats.  The tester was supplied with a system of two parachutes: the first stabilization was opened immediately after the jump (due to which the jumps were not recognized as the FIA ‚Äã‚Äãrecord), the second one opened automatically and quietly delivered the tester to the ground. <br>  During the first jump, the stabilization parachute did not open. Joe hit a tailspin with 120 rpm (an overload sensor in the head area showed 22 units) and lost consciousness.  He was saved by the second parachute, which opened automatically.  The second jump was successful.  But during the third ascent of the stratostat, Colonel Kittinger noticed that the suit's right glove was not tight, but decided to continue flying.  Upon landing on the ground, his right hand was swollen due to pressure and was severely frozen. <br><br>  In the third flight, which took place on August 16, 1960, Joe Kittinger set several records at once: the height of the climb on the stratostat, the height and duration of the jump on the braking (stabilizing) parachute and the highest rate of decline of a person in the atmosphere developed without using a vehicle.  However, all these records were registered by the USAF.  FAI does not recognize them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3a2/1a7/91e/3a21a791ef02c5f1cbb2da1a170a6ba0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  So Felix Baumgartner's jump is not so simple! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/84196/">https://habr.com/ru/post/84196/</a></p>
