      The book is based on the principle of <i>application-oriented development</i> - the development concepts are shown on the example of fully functional Android applications, and not code fragments.  Each chapter begins with an introduction, which briefly describes the application being developed.  Then the results of testing the application and an overview of the technologies used in its development are given.  Next is a detailed analysis of the source code of the application.  The source code for all applications is available at <a href="http://www.deitel.com/Books/Android/AndroidforProgrammers2e/tabid/3653/Default.aspx"><i></i></a><i><a href="http://www.deitel.com/books/AndroidFP2/">www.deitel.com/books/AndroidFP2</a></i> .  While reading the book, we recommend keeping the source code open in the development environment. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  The target audience </h5><br>  It is assumed that the readers of this book know the Java language and are experienced in object-oriented programming and are familiar with XML.  Thanks to the improved development tools for Android applications in this edition, we were able to almost completely eliminate XML markup.  There are only two small and clear XML files left in the book that you will have to work with.  We use only complete working applications, therefore, even without knowing Java, but with experience in object-oriented programming in C #.. NET, Objective-C / Cocoa or C ++ (with class libraries), you can quickly learn the material in the book, and at the same time learn a lot of useful things about java and object-oriented programming.  This book is <i>not a</i> Java tutorial, but at the same time it contains a significant amount of material on these technologies in the context of the development of Android applications. <br><br><h5>  Book Features </h5><br>  <b>Application oriented development</b> .  Each of Chapters 2‚Äì8 presents one complete application ‚Äî it examines the functions of the application, provides screenshots of the running application, the results of test runs, and an overview of the technologies and architectures used to create the application.  Then we build the graphical interface of the application, present its full source code and conduct a detailed analysis of this code;  We discuss the concepts used in programming and demonstrate the functionality of the Android API used to create the application. <br><br>  <b>Android SDK 4.3 and 4.4</b> .  The book discusses the many new features included in the Android SDK (Software Development Kit) 4.3 and 4.4. <br><br>  <b>Fragments</b> .  Starting in Chapter 5, we will use snippets to create and manage portions of the graphical interface of each slice.  Combining several fragments, you can create interfaces that effectively use the space of the tablet screen.  The developer can easily replace fragments, which makes the graphical interface more dynamic;  An example of fragment switching is discussed in Chapter 8. <br><br>  <b>Support for different sizes and screen resolutions</b> .  The application chapters will demonstrate the use of Android auto-selection tools (layouts, images, etc.) based on the size and orientation of the device. <br><br>  <b>Description of the Eclipse-based ADT (Android Development Tools) development environment in the printed version of the book</b> .  The free Android Development Tools (ADT) integrated development environment (IDE), which includes Eclipse and the ADT plugin, in combination with the free JDK (Java Development Kit) provides everything you need to create, launch and debug Android applications that support their distribution (for example, sending to the Google Play store), etc. <br><br>  <b>Android Studio</b> .  A promising development environment for the future development of Android applications.  Since the Android Studio environment is developing rapidly, its discussion is posted online <a href="http://www.deitel.com/Books/Android/AndroidforProgrammers2e/tabid/3653/Default.aspx">at</a> .  We will show how to import ready-made projects for application testing.  It will also demonstrate the creation of new applications, building a graphical interface, editing resource files and testing applications. <br><br>  <b>Dive mode</b>  The status bar at the top of the screen and the menu buttons at the bottom can be hidden so that your applications can use most of the screen.  To access the status panel, the user swipes from the top edge of the screen, and the system panel with the Back, Home and Recent Apps buttons - from the bottom edge. <br><br>  <b>Printing infrastructure</b>  Android 4.4 KitKat allows you to add print support to your application: search for available printers via Wi-Fi or in the cloud, select paper size, select print pages, etc. <br><br>  <b>Testing on Android smartphones, tablets and emulator</b> .  To achieve optimal results, applications should be tested on physical smartphones and Android tablets.  Useful information can also be obtained when testing in the Android emulator (see the ‚ÄúPreparation‚Äù section), however, emulation creates a significant load on the processor and can work slowly, especially in games with a large number of moving objects.  Chapter 1 lists some Android features not supported by the emulator. <br><br>  <b>Multimedia</b> .  Applications use a variety of Android multimedia capabilities, including graphics, images, frame-by-frame animation, animation, and audio. <br><br>  <b>Sending apps to Google Play</b> .  Chapter 9 describes the process of signing up for Google Play and setting up an account for selling apps.  You will learn how to prepare an application to be sent to Google Play, how to set the price for an application, and learn how to monetize applications through advertising and internal sales.  Resources will also be presented that can be used for marketing applications.  Chapter 9 can be read after chapter 1. <br><br><h5>  About the authors </h5><br>  <b>Paul J. Deitel (Paul J.
