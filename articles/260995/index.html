The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe direction is the implementation of a set of measures in a limited area (city) that open up new markets for security entrepreneurs and give them the opportunity to sell their services and products according to the <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/10512/">uber model</a> principle.  In this article, I would like to briefly review 3 key concepts that, in my opinion, make SafeCityNET direction: <br><br><ol><li>  Infrastructure "smart city" </li><li>  Service platform </li><li>  Security services market </li></ol><br>  Next, we consider in more detail each of the concepts. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Infrastructure "smart city" </h5><br>  Already today, many major world cities are developing on the principle of a ‚Äú <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/219397/">smart city</a> ‚Äù in which the ICT component plays a rather important role.  From a practical point of view, this means that in the future cities will represent a network of various sensors and sensors, which in real time collect information about what is happening around and transmit it to the data processing center (DPC) for subsequent analysis and storage.  At the same time, information from open sources can be supplied to the same data center, for example, <a href="http://www.mosgorzdrav.ru/bms">medical and statistical</a> information about the health status of the population from medical institutions, <a href="https://mvd.ru/Deljatelnost/statistics">statistics and analytics</a> from the Ministry of Internal Affairs, <a href="http://www.mchs.gov.ru/folder/717147">statistics</a> on fire safety and other open (non personal data) information from various federal and municipal bodies.

    <h5>  Service platform </h5><br>  Just collect data from the "smart city" is not enough.  It is very important that a huge stream of semi-structured and heterogeneous information is properly processed, so that later the data can be turned into useful information with which to conduct research and make qualitative analytics.  For this, there is a large variety of different data processing methods that can be conventionally combined into one BigData term.  In essence, the service platform is a data center with powerful servers and a team of analytics and developers who create software to ‚Äúdigest‚Äù data from a ‚Äúsmart city‚Äù into clear and accessible information that can be used to ensure security in a given area. <br><br><h5>  Security services market </h5><br>  So, we have collected and ready for use information about the "state" of the city in real time.  What can be done with it in terms of security?  In our group SafeNET, the project ‚ÄúSecurity Navigator‚Äù was announced, the essence of which is as follows.  Suppose your child returns home from school every day on a pre-planned route.  For some reason (stayed away) the child will have to go on a completely different route, and even in the dark.  Usually, in such a situation, parents try to accompany their children to eliminate the likelihood of any threats to the child, but with the ‚Äúsafety navigator‚Äù application installed on the phone, you can order the ‚Äúsafe route‚Äù service for your child through it.  You enter data about your child (location, social network profile), safety options you would like to receive (protection from beatings, accidents, kidnapping, etc.) and the service automatically builds a safe route to the house, which guarantees 96% security in accordance with the specified parameters, in parallel issuing you a bill for payment.  And for those fractions of a second, while the route is being laid, the service performs the following actions: <br><br><ol><li>  Calls to the service platform and requests the necessary data; </li><li>  Analyzes them and calculates the probabilities of certain threats on the route; </li><li>  Calculates the safest route; </li><li>  If necessary, performs active actions to ensure safety on the route (sends the drone or task force); </li><li>  Provides a route to the end user with their recommendations; </li><li>  Controls the client throughout the route and assesses a probabilistic picture of threats in real time using data from the service platform. </li></ol><br>  As a result, the end user receives a safe route and security guarantees from the service provider company. <br><br>  This example is a special case of using the service platform to implement one specific service.  In the future, there may be dozens and hundreds of such services, depending on the requests from the public and the interpretation of the very concept of ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù, which will obviously change over time.  Thus, the service platform becomes a kind of infrastructure unit, which allows, on its basis, to create new markets for security services, which will be in demand in the near future. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/260995/">https://habr.com/ru/post/260995/</a></p>
