Watching the most famous tournament where champions fight is a pleasure.  But if you are sick, sitting in front of the screen of your TV or watching the game from the tablet, do not be discouraged.  Impressions of the game will be almost the same as that of a person who sees the court with his own eyes.  IBM technologies help to enhance the effect of personal presence for those who could not (or did not want) to attend the tournament. <br><br>  In addition, our system will analyze thousands and thousands of fan messages on social networks, including Twitter, Facebook, Instagram.  IBM Watson will study different messages, and not just those related to tennis.  Last year, our company‚Äôs cloud services on Twitter analyzed about 400 messages per second.  Monitoring was also conducted on Facebook, Instagram and several other social networks.  What for?  Everything is explained simply. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The fact is that the number of Wimbledon spectators reached 71 million last year.  Most viewers want to not only watch the game, but also to receive additional information about the matches of their favorite athletes.  And the special application of the Wimbledon tournament (for iOS and Android) helps to quickly and easily deliver such information.  Namely - a personalized stream of messages from social networks.  One of the objectives of our cognitive system at the tournament - the definition of the emotions of the audience.  Watching the experiences of visitors to the championship cognitive system will be using cameras.  And according to the results of such observations, IBM Watson can easily understand which athlete you support.  Accordingly, you will receive more information on this player.

The user can view detailed information about the characteristics of the player, his past victories and defeats.  Statistics throughout the game will also be constantly demonstrated - if you wish, you can switch to individual tournament participants. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1ab/cf3/0be/1abcf30bebe74fcbb99246a2a8defefd.jpg"><br>  <i>Data on players at the time of 2013.</i>  <i>Now the information is even more detailed.</i> <br><br>  The application can be personalized, giving priority to relevant content for your favorite players or individual games.  The application works with data accumulated over eight years of the tournament. <br><br>  In fact, the IBM Watson Championship will use 3.2 million reference data from 19 courts for 13 days.  The accuracy should be about 100%.  The cognitive system information obtained during the game will be provided to commentators who will receive considerable assistance in the process of observing the game. <br><br>  In just four seconds, exclusive data provided by the IBM Watson system will be sent to the mobile phones of many viewers around the world. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/9pC1Qz0wnWw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgwXkNoBPvO0rr24P3JKL8Hl12qLA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  IBM will also monitor the information security of the tournament.  Our company is able to identify and block thousands of suspicious informational events occurring during the tournament.  For example, last year the number of cyber attacks during Wimbledon increased by 500%. <br><br>  Now IBM is working not only with Wimbledon.  Our company also collaborates with the Australian Open, French Open and US Open.  This year, our company will add the following areas to the existing system for working with Wimbledon data: <br><ul><li>  Providing information in real time.  Spectators receive personalized information about the match, players, previous championships.  Also added a table of champions of all time and data on new achievements that users of Wimbledon applications will receive immediately. </li><li>  Social interaction.  Audience questions from around the world will be passed on to those who watch the tournament directly at Wimbledon.  It is clear that the tournament visitors themselves must agree to receive questions, and if they wish, they will be able to answer them.  If a person does not want to receive questions, the application will not disturb him. </li><li>  Analysis of the game.  Tennis fans get real-time game results plus an analysis of what's happening on the field.  SlamTracker allows viewers to send tournament information to their social network accounts. </li></ul><br>  As a result, viewers who watch the tournament from their tablets, phones, TV, will get the impression of a personal presence at the game.  From year to year, the difference in impressions of the immediate "participants in the events" and the spectators watching the game remotely becomes less and less noticeable.  In many ways, this distance leveling became possible thanks to IBM Watson and other services and technologies of our company.  Recall that IBM has been a Wimbledon partner since 1990.  For 26 a lot has changed.  And most of these changes are positive. <br>  Well, it remains only to wish a successful viewing and victory of the athlete for whom you support! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/304524/">https://habr.com/ru/post/304524/</a></p>
