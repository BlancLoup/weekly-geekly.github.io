  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Expedia may take second place in the hotel business from AirBnB</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today <a href="http://www.expediainc.com/">Expedia Inc.</a>  announced the purchase of a rental service for <a href="http://www.homeaway.com/">HomeAway</a> and its sites for $ 3.9 billion.  Expedia will pay $ 10.15 for each HomeAway share.  The transaction must be closed in the first quarter of 2016. <br><br>  Expedia owns one of the largest tourist sites, <a href="https://www.expedia.com/">expedia.com</a> .  The company also owns services such as <a href="http://ru.hotels.com/">Hotels.com</a> , <a href="https://www.hotwire.com/">Hotwire.com</a> , <a href="https://www.travelocity.com/">Travelocity</a> and <a href="http://www.orbitz.com/">Orbitz</a> . <br><br>  HomeAway was founded in Austin (Texas) in 2005.  The total investment received by the company in five rounds is almost $ 505 million.  In 2011, HomeAway <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2011/06/28/homeaway-ipo-prices-at-27share-valued-at-2-2b/">entered</a> the IPO.

      The company provides over a million different apartments in 190 countries.  In addition, HomeAway owns <a href="http://vrbo.com/">VRBO.com</a> and <a href="https://www.vacationrentals.com/">VacationRental.com</a> .  They work in the USA.  However, outside the states - in the UK, Germany, France, Spain, Brazil and New Zealand - the company has similar services.  HomeAway is a world leader in its niche. <br><br>  In late January, the company <a href="http://www.3dnews.ru/908556">announced</a> the acquisition of online travel agency Travelocity, a subsidiary of the technology company Saber Corp. <a name="habracut"></a>  The amount of the transaction was $ 280 million.  ‚ÄúTravelocity is one of North America‚Äôs most famous travel brands, offering thousands of travel destinations for more than 20 million passengers a month,‚Äù said Expedia President and CEO Dara Khosrowshahi. <br><br>  In early February, Expedia <a href="http://www.cnews.ru/news/top/expedia_poglotila_konkurenta_za_16_mlrd">signed</a> an agreement to purchase Orbitz Worldwide and all the brands owned by this company.  For each Orbitz share, the buyer offered $ 12, which is 29% higher than the average value of the securities over the last five days of trading.  The amount of the transaction will be approximately $ 1.6 billion. <br><br>  Orbitz Worldwide owns Orbitz.com, its main brand.  The Orbitz.com website is designed to search and purchase air tickets, book hotels, book cars, search and purchase sea cruises and package deals.  It is positioned as a resource for consumers and business customers. <br><br>  Buying HomeAway will allow Expedia to compete with one of the most expensive online services on the hotel business <a href="https://www.airbnb.ru/">market</a> , <a href="https://www.airbnb.ru/">AirBnB</a> , The Verge <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/11/4/9672208/expedia-acquires-home-away">reports</a> . <br><br>  In late June, Megamind <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/16862/">wrote</a> that AirBnB received $ 1.5 billion in the next round of funding.  After that, the company's valuation should reach $ 24 billion.  At the same time it was reported that the evaluation of the Expedia travel service does not exceed half of the estimated cost of AirBnB, but its profit reaches $ 6.5 billion.  The undisputed market leader is Priceline with a capitalization of $ 61 billion. <br><br>  On November 3, San Francisco residents voted in favor of <a href="http://sfgov2.org/ftp/uploadedfiles/elections/candidates/Nov2015/ShortTermRentals_Text.pdf">Proposal F</a> ‚Äî an initiative that helped seriously undermine AirBnB's business.  Residents of the hometown of the company voted to restrict short-term rental housing to 75 days a year and for AirBnB to take responsibility to monitor and delete violator proposals on its website.  But the project failed. <br><br>  The community of Silicon Valley homeowners, a group of district activists and defenders of tenants ‚Äôrights have collected more than 20,000 signatures to say‚Äú we have had enough. ‚Äù  AirBnB spent more than $ 8 million in confronting Offer F. <br><br>  The coveted first place in the hotel business market for Expedia and AirBnB is still unattainable.  But since now AirBnB has fallen into disgrace, and its business has gone worse, Expedia has every chance of winning second place. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296058/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296058/</a></p>
