A little information for thought on this issue. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/700/b8e/bcf/700b8ebcfd424ad1b0c81d55f76c0b7d.png"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  We take a video from the wonderful channel Muscle &amp; Motion with an analysis of the anatomy of the squats:

And what do squats look like in the overwhelming majority of sit-office people?  Something like this, this is at best: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e46/3c0/7e9/e463c07e9ec94b54b539593d1a06395c.png"><br><br>  As you can see, the lumbar region no longer has a lordosis, and Madame has only completed a quarter-quarter and has not even reached her working chair (I do not even touch my knees, the shoulder girdle, or the distribution of the center of gravity).  What happens to the disks while doing this?  That's right, they experience uneven compression - the front section gets a greater load, the rear one is smaller. <br><br>  Why is the protrusion of the lumbar discs (they account for up to half of the protrusions of the discs in general) - one of the most common diseases today?  Probably because all people are gravitating?  Because since childhood in the sections of weightlifting squat and squat? <br><br>  Or maybe because they sit from childhood for 8-10 hours a day, move a little, have weak muscles and do not have the skills to use them?  And because dozens or even hundreds of times every day people sit on a chair, on a bench in the subway, on the toilet (dozens in general, although in some situations there is only that last item), and also bend, walk, run and jump (well, it is very rare, but it happens) - and all this is done with a violation of posture and chronic overload of the disks, as well as small joints of the spine and ligaments?  A rhetorical question. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aab/a39/bcb/aaba39bcb6554279b3335c6f04e9ebd3.jpg"><br><br>  Let's not talk about the rehabilitation of back pain - with regard to prevention.  The first thing that comes to mind is the need to strengthen the deep muscles of the back and abdominals to avoid such irregular movements in the lower back.  In general, you need.  But there are two problems. <br><br>  The first - a typical violation of posture is just the same as hyperlordosis in the lumbar spine, which appears as a biomechanical compensation for malfunctioning large muscles (although this results in more damage because it increases the amplitude of flexion in the lumbar spine).  To strengthen the deep muscles of the back and there is no big sense - they are constantly tense anyway.  And ‚Äúpress‚Äù the press still needs to be able to correctly - a lot of people do not know how to turn off the work of the leg muscles and injure the lower back even more due to the contraction of the lumbar-iliac muscles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0ef/e7b/17e/0efe7b17eaf14e9eb867f31655e712f3.JPG"><br><br>  But even if you take up the strengthening of these muscles, but your leg muscles are not strong enough, especially the buttocks (many people who sit a lot can‚Äôt even contract these muscles normally), then ultimately you will not be able to squat with a normal amplitude and stable back position.  And this is without additional weight.  And when trying to lift something heavy (a car battery from a floor, a cupboard or sofa during a repair, a child who joyfully jumped on your back) for years weary structures of the lumbar spine can make themselves felt and a backache, sciatica, and other things happen trouble  Although often it is enough for this and more simple reasons - for example, tying shoelaces (note the lower back at this point). <br><br>  What is logical to do?  To learn how to squat properly, and then it is best to train a certain amount of muscle power so that there is an excess of resources for squats in all situations.  For this, squats with weights are already used - in physical education these are metered and cautious squats. <br><br>  If an old-fashioned doctor who doesn‚Äôt really follow the physical education periodicals says that only the pool is good for the health of the back (forgive me for sticking to this pool - they don‚Äôt really have anything against it, a useful thing, but for most people it‚Äôs just not enough but also it is necessary to explain what is there to do and what is not), and squats - horror-horror are harmful, then you can both agree and argue with the last thesis.  If you squat like in the picture with a girl, or even worse rounding the lower back, even squats on an office chair are harmful, not to mention weight. <br><br>  And if you squat correctly?  Can I get a chair?  And with 12 kg of weights during a physical break?  Yes, women 's hands on their hands - will be heavier.  And with 20 kg?  Etc.  - You can not discuss the issue of squats with weight without dosing load.  Paracelsus also said "everything is medicine, everything is poison - and only the dose determines what is which."  The same with physical exercises - there are no absolutely useful and absolutely harmful ones, the first thing that determines the benefit is the technique, the second is the dosing of the intensity of the loads, the third is the correct construction of the training process as a whole. <br><br>  By the way, you can watch the loins in the video of the beloved TV channel of all Yougifted fitness people - you really don't need to squat with weight like this: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/GotRb2Ob7MA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjXc3SACjEpVFZQOIbV6VFKZVXnkg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/363183/">https://habr.com/ru/post/363183/</a></p>
