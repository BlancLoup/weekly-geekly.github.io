One of the options was coworking - a wonderful model, but, unfortunately, not compatible with the desire not to shine their projects before they start.  In addition, <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B3">co-working centers</a> we still have very little, and the closest, as a rule, is not at all close. <br><br>  For myself, I would have found the right solution - while it's warm, I‚Äôm going every day to get out on a bike somewhere far away from people, so as not to interfere, and to work, enjoying nature and fresh air.  You can, of course, without a great one, but I will also improve my health on the way, and I will be able to call in the most beautiful and quiet places.  Sometimes you can take your wife with you, let her write landscapes, or a programmer‚Äôs friend who will be involved in her own projects or projects with me.  In fact, you get the same coworking, but, importantly, there will be only people you trust.  All you need to be happy is a correctly selected bike (which will be convenient to ride around the city and off-road), a laptop with decent battery life, at least some Internet (I think, a mobile with a head is enough) and a backpack with sandwiches. <br><br>  Of course, no matter how hard I tried, the laptop will not work for a long time without recharging (I will write below, as I plan to resolve this issue), and I can‚Äôt bear all the work in the forest, you will need high-speed Internet at some stages, and scanners with printers etc. Therefore, this decision will not allow to completely relieve the house from work, but for the time being it suits me.  I will see soon what comes out of this in practice, and will definitely share my impressions.

      Now I am picking up a laptop and a bicycle.  About this and wanted to talk.  Well, at the same time to discuss the very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcycling coworking. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><h1>  Bicycle </h1>  You will have to ride it both on asphalt, and on various curbs and steps in the city, forest roads and, possibly, sand.  Therefore, we need a universal bike.  After walking through a variety of online bike shops and forums, I realized that I, with my modest experience of riding in Ukraine, were far behind the times.  It turns out that the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4">great divide</a> , not only sports, mountain and domestic.  :) And I don‚Äôt need a mountain at all - to overcome long distances on a hard road on a soft and wide rubber with wheels of medium diameter is something else a perversion.  And the soft shock absorbers, especially the rear ones, will be very inconvenient here - the legs will spend energy not in the right place.  Road or tourist travel is great for the road, but off-road will have problems with them.  What I need is in a group of motocross or hybrid bikes.  They have both normal-sized wheels (like ‚ÄúUkraine‚Äù), and the tires are suitable, and the shock absorbers with brakes are optimally selected for such use as I need. <br><br>  For a long time it was determined with the manufacturer, but I realized that there would not be much difference between global brands.  Moreover, the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259E%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%2583%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0">equipment</a> (brakes, drive, gear shifting, etc.) they often put the same - a third-party manufacturer, which only deals with equipment.  Equipment can be chosen for every taste (quality is divided into groups) and budget.  He also paid attention to the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4">frame material</a> (he chose aluminum alloys - they are lighter and tougher, do not rust) and appearance.  While stopped at <a href="http://www.kellys.com.ua/price.php">Kellys</a> .  I liked the design of those models that are arranged by parameters and price.  In addition, the models you like are with both male and female frames, and this is important for me - I want my wife to take the bicycle right away. <br><br>  Actually, here are a couple of greats that I want to touch one of these days and take some of them: <a href="http://www.kellys.com.ua/bike.php%3Fb%3Dkellys_2008%26n1%3DCROSS%26n2%3DSAPHIX">SAPHIX</a> and <a href="http://www.kellys.com.ua/bike.php%3Fb%3Dkellys_2008%26n1%3DCROSS%26n2%3DGAMMA">GAMMA</a> (frame - aluminum alloy, low cost attachments, metal pedals, $ 400), <a href="http://www.kellys.com.ua/bike.php%3Fb%3Dkellys_2008%26n1%3DCROSS%26n2%3DSTYLUS">STYLUS</a> and <a href="http://www.kellys.com.ua/bike.php%3Fb%3Dkellys_2008%26n1%3DCROSS%26n2%3DKAPPA">KAPPA</a> (frame - aluminum alloy, entry level <a href="http://www.kellys.com.ua/bike.php%3Fb%3Dkellys_2008%26n1%3DCROSS%26n2%3DRESULT">linkage</a> , pedals - plastic, $ 300), <a href="http://www.kellys.com.ua/bike.php%3Fb%3Dkellys_2008%26n1%3DCROSS%26n2%3DRESULT">RESULT</a> and <a href="http://www.kellys.com.ua/bike.php%3Fb%3Dkellys_2008%26n1%3DCROSS%26n2%3DALPHA">ALPHA</a> (frame - steel, entry level <a href="http://www.kellys.com.ua/bike.php%3Fb%3Dkellys_2008%26n1%3DCROSS%26n2%3DRESULT">linkage</a> , pedals - plastic, $ 270).  I would like to hear the comments of people who dealt with such bikes or at least their components.  Is it worth the difference in the quality of equipment, for example, SAPHIX and STYLUS of these $ 100?  How reliable are the aluminum alloy frames?  Everywhere they warn that even though they are tougher, they accumulate fatigue, and with intense skating they can burst at one point. <br><br>  Interesting and general tips about buying a bike.  I do not mean what they write on the sites of stores about the height of the frame, etc. What should I check when buying?  What warranties are considered acceptable? <br><br><h1>  A laptop </h1>  In terms of performance, I am satisfied with almost all the models available on the market, so I looked more at battery life, compatibility with the desired OS, appearance and price.  From manufacturers looked at ACER, Asus, DELL, Hewlett Packard.  Screens with glossy surfaces were rejected, as there will be a lot of glare outdoors.  The operating system and design of the laptop are individual things, so I‚Äôll just write that the <a href="http://www1.euro.dell.com/content/products/compare.aspx/vostronb%3Fc%3Dua%26l%3Dru%26s%3Dbsd">Dell Vostro</a> line ( <a href="http://www1.euro.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx/vostronb_1000%3Fc%3Dua%26l%3Dru%26s%3Dbsd">Vostro 1000</a> ) came up to me.  You can buy them without operating systems, they are sold with a 3-year warranty, there are options with a reinforced case, all models have a keyboard with a protective film from moisture and dust, the battery life is stated up to 5 hours (although in reviews they write about 3). <br><br>  In general, finding something that holds a charge of 4 hours and more at a reasonable price turned out to be problematic.  Yes, and I wanted to meet the other criteria that interested me.  The way out, I see the purchase of an additional battery.  One will be charged at home while I do not sleep, the second will be put on the night.  There is another option with the purchase of a converter from the cigarette lighter and a car battery (+ charger to it).  But it is not very convenient, although it will not need to be charged every day. <br><br>  There are still doubts about the screen diagonal.  On the one hand, I want a compact size, and on the other hand, comfortable work.  Is 14 inches enough for programming, layout of sites and drawing in Gimpe, or less than 15 don't even look? <br><br>  If I am in some way mistaken or did not take into account some points when choosing laptop models and is great, write, I will appreciate any comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/26687/">https://habr.com/ru/post/26687/</a></p>
