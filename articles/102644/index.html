I don‚Äôt remember the film (‚ÄúRecall All‚Äù or something), but this scanner has already migrated from cinema scenes to the laboratories of the institutes.  At least, almost such a scanner was developed by scientists from the Wright State Research Institute. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  According to the developers, their scanner will scan the skeleton of people at airports, stadiums, amusement parks and other public places that may be vulnerable to terrorist attacks.  The image received by the scanner will be checked against the police database.  That is, everything will be approximately the same as it is now with fingerprints - there is a base of fingerprints of criminals and persons who the police have already come across earlier for all bad reasons, there is an image obtained from a scanner.  When reconciliation we obtain the identification of a person.

      It is interesting that the scanners, created by the technology developed by scientists, will work at a distance of up to 50 meters.  I do not know how, but scientists promise full operation of their devices at such a distance.  The developers claim that both fingerprints and facial features can be changed.  But the bones of a person is not yet able to change.  In an adult, the skeleton consists of 206 bones.  The size, shape, density and structure of each bone are more individual than fingerprints.  Separate bones of a skeleton are especially individual.  In addition, a person can be identified by fractures, bone damage, implants and other details.  All this is very individual and practically does not change (of course, if a person does not break his bones every year). <br><br>  Scientists say that there is no need to scan the entire skeleton to identify a person.  It is enough to choose some part of the body where the bones are the most unique, if I may say so, and scan this particular part.  Now researchers are working on determining the most unique part of the human skeleton, which can be used as an identifier.  It takes about 5 seconds for a ‚Äúsnapshot‚Äù of one person, and another 10 are needed to identify a snapshot, that is, comparisons with examples available in the database. <br><br>  As mentioned above, the practical application of such a system is very extensive, considering also such an advantage of a new type of scanner (unfortunately, there is very little information about it in the original source), like ‚Äúlong range‚Äù.  The developers believe that it will be possible to use such scanners in private companies, state-owned closed objects, and so on. <br><br>  Not so long ago, a storm of disturbances in Europe and the United States caused scanners that scan a person to his full height, giving a picture of a person‚Äôs body without clothes (not quite clear, of course, but still).  It is clear that this system does not particularly like people.  A skeleton scanner will allow you to avoid this by not "shining" anything but bones and solid objects, which can be a weapon.  Two prototype scanners of the skeleton are ready, and if necessary, a complete system can be deployed in about a year. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.wright.edu/cgi-bin/cm/news.cgi%3Faction%3Dnews_item%26id%3D1803">Source of</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/102644/">https://habr.com/ru/post/102644/</a></p>
