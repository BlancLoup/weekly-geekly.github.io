It does not matter whether there are comments on the desired page, whether they are available to the current user or not, he will still be able to leave a comment and read the comments of other users registered in the <a href="https://fairloris.com/">Fairloris</a> system. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  About the idea itself </h2><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OC6sDIe3aOk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Often, using this or that web service, reading some article or looking for reviews about the product, I was visited by the thought of some kind of centralized service, where you could read reviews or comments from people or leave yours.  Of course, sites with various reviews about anything on the Internet are already quite a few, but they still need to be found, and then you can find information on them about what you are looking for.  It would be much easier and more convenient to have the opportunity, being directly on the product page, service or information of interest, to press a button and get a list of comments about it right there, as the saying goes: ‚Äúwithout departing from the cashier‚Äù. <br><br>  The same applies to the functionality that allows you to leave a review.  I do not want to go somewhere to another site, register there and only then have the opportunity to leave a comment.  I want to do it right here and now.  In this case, registering once, I want to be able to leave a comment everywhere, regardless of what kind of site.

      All these thoughts led me to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe <a href="https://fairloris.com/">Fairloris</a> project, although of course this is the idea, and the implementation is completely different and this is what will be discussed below. <br><br><h2>  What is the current </h2><br>  I will try not to spread much thought and set out the main points: <br><br><ol><li>  I had a partner who, in principle, became the initiator of the transition from the idea to its realization.  In my area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility is the technical part, namely the preparation of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE_%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D1%2583%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582">MVP</a> , the recruitment of the team and control over further development.  In the area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility of the partner primary funding and organizational issues. </li><li>  Implemented <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE_%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D1%2583%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582">MVP</a> , which is: <br><br><ul><li>  Google Chrome browser extension that allows you to add and view previously added comments to any web page on the Internet. </li><li>  A server backend that accepts, stores and gives comments. </li><li>  HTTP API that binds backend and extension together. </li></ul></li><li>  The project is fully prepared to attract investment through <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICO_(%25D0%25BA%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BF%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258E%25D1%2582%25D1%258B)">ICO</a> with the following schedule: <br><br><ul><li>  Pre ICO: from 14:00 GMT October 10, 2017 to 14:00 GMT October 24, 2017. </li><li>  ICO: from 14:00 GMT on November 10, 2017 to 14:00 GMT on December 4, 2017. </li></ul><br></li><li>  A good international team of developers, QA, SMM specialists and managers who are waiting for the end of the fundraising in order to get started. </li></ol><br><h2>  Future plans </h2><br>  If the fundraising for <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICO_(%25D0%25BA%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BF%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258E%25D1%2582%25D1%258B)">ICO is</a> successful, the company will immediately be opened, the Fairloris trademark will be registered and the team will be fully equipped, and in the beginning of 2018, direct work will begin on the project implementation, which will be divided into stages, which are described in more detail below. <br><br>  <b>April 2018</b> <br><br>  This month we plan to complete the development of a scalable backend, which will be able to store an increasing number of comments and process requests for working with them.  It is also planned to complete the development of the RESTful API by this point, to communicate with the new backend. <br><br>  Technically, the backend will be implemented using: GoLang, PostgreSQL Cluster, Redis, RabbitMQ and Load Balancer. <br><br>  <b>July 2018</b> <br><br>  This month we plan to complete the development of a full-featured browser extension: Google Chrome, Mozilla FireFox, Opera, Safari and Microsoft Edge. <br><br>  <b>July 2018</b> <br><br>  This month we plan to complete the development of a mobile application for iOS and Android platforms, which will implement the functionality of a mobile browser with the addition of the functionality of the Fairloris system.  As a base, it is planned to use a ready-made open-source mobile browser engine. <br><br>  <b>August 2018</b> <br><br>  This month we plan to complete the development of our own CDN system for storing and distributing images that users can attach to their comments. <br><br>  <b>October 2018</b> <br><br>  This month it is planned to launch a large-scale PR campaign, both on the Internet and abroad, namely on TV, radio and in specialized paper publications. <br><br>  <b>December 2018</b> <br><br>  This month, it is planned to complete the development of an advertising network that provides advertisements based on: the context of the commented pages, user parameters, preferences and interests. <br><br>  Also this month, it is planned to complete the development of a Desktop browser based on Google Chromium with built-in functionality of Fairloris, a project cryptocurrency wallet (FLR) with built-in algorithm mining (PoS) linked to the time of using the browser in online mode, the ability to customize the look and platform expansion of Fairloris functionality by network users.  Read more about the cryptocurrency of the project further. <br><br><h2>  Using cryptocurrency in the project </h2><br>  In any system where the amount of content has exceeded a certain limit, the task of moderating it turns into a very nontrivial, and often practically impossible task.  Users of various social networks and other systems with a large amount of user content are initially weakly motivated to generate high-quality content that is useful to other users.  The main incentive for them is only the approval or censure of community members, which in most cases is expressed in the evaluation of their content in the form of votes. <br><br>  Our project to solve this problem involves the use of its own cryptocurrency, which will motivate content creators to improve its quality, and other users to a more thoughtful assessment and even self-moderation. <br><br>  Speaking in more detail, the project involves the following cryptocurrency applications: <br><br><ol><li>  By charging the cryptocurrency, the authors of the comments will be rewarded for every positive vote of other users. </li><li>  By writing off cryptocurrencies, comment authors will be punished for every negative vote of other users. </li><li>  Based on the vote for comments, their authors will form a rating, for the amount of which users will either be rewarded or punished on a daily or monthly basis. </li><li>  Each user of the project can become the initial moderator and moderate the comments of any web-page to which he has access.  All comments modeled by him will be checked by moderators at higher levels and, if confirmed, the initial moderator will be rewarded with the project cryptocurrency. </li></ol><br>  The more users will be in the project and the more actively they will behave, the more project cryptocurrency they will receive, therefore the greater the number of cryptocurrency wallets will be installed on users' computers and the more stable and demand the project cryptocurrency will become. <br><br>  At this I have everything, thank you all for your interest. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/339858/">https://habr.com/ru/post/339858/</a></p>
