      If you are developing in JavaScript, this course will help you understand what awaits you in the near future.  We have tried to give a brief overview of new trends and modern possibilities in developing applications for JavaScript: whether they are complex web solutions, Windows applications or cross-platform applications, or games.  We will also look into the future a little bit and look at the possibilities of the next version of the JavaScript standard - ECMAScript 6 and touch on new areas in which JS can be applied today. <br><br>  <strong>Hit!</strong>  <a href="http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/training-courses/introduction-to-angularjs">Introduction to AngularJS</a> <br><br>  Web developers, if you like the <a href="http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/training-courses/single-page-applications-with-jquery-or-angularjs%3Fm%3D11547">Introduction to AngularJS</a> module in the course <a href="http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/training-courses/single-page-applications-with-jquery-or-angularjs">One-page applications with jQuery and AngularJS</a> , then get ready for an even more powerful course!

Such devices are often simply impossible to include in the domain and, as a result, traditional approaches and management tools are not applicable to them.  In a series of courses under the general heading "Corporate devices" you will learn about technologies that provide secure access to corporate resources from mobile devices running Windows, Windows Phone, iOS and Android.  The second course of the series discusses technologies for securing devices with Windows 8.1, discusses the new Work Folders file synchronization mechanism introduced in Windows Server 2012 R2, provides an overview of the Azure Rights Management Services document protection cloud service, and illustrates the use of dynamic access control in conjunction with the technologies listed . <br><br>  <strong>New.</strong>  <a href="http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/training-courses/migrating-to-windows-server-2012-r2-and-microsoft-azure-rus">Migration to Windows Server 2012 R2 and Microsoft Azure</a> <br><br>  Soon enough, namely July 14, 2015, support for the server operating systems of the Windows Server 2003 family and Windows Server 2003 R2 family will end.
