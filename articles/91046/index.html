  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Features of the Belarusian implementation of electronic document management in customs</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In 2009, the Government of Belarus was concerned with the introduction of <a title="electronic declaration" href="http://www.customs.gov.by/ru/eldeclaration">electronic declaration</a> (hereinafter ED) at customs.  And the department of customs clearance puzzled our IT with preparations for the introduction of ED in the enterprise.  We went deep into the study of the information provided and analysis, what should we do about it all, when suddenly from another piece of information we had a bright prospect of emergency implementation of ED.  But this process turned out to be rapid, costly and spontaneous. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  year 2009 </h4><br>  So let's start with the fact that we have already purchased a software package and paid for the update for six months in advance, everyone is happy and working.  And here, after the next seminar, the customs illuminates the sales department with a plan for introducing ED, which, in turn, hand over the handwritten instructions and service that it should work ‚Äútomorrow‚Äù.  It turns out our company suddenly turned out to be a <strong>conscientious</strong> participant in foreign economic activity.  The whole process of introducing ED in the country has been happening since the beginning of the year, although we were puzzled a week before the planned entry of ED in the enterprise. <br><br>  Everything is good, but it turns out to be necessary ...

      <br>
    <h5>  New software </h5><br>  One of the conditions for participation in ED is the need to conclude an agreement and buy software with an annual update of ~ $ 300 in 2010 (in 2009 was about $ 900) from a <strong>certain</strong> supplier, we also pay ~ $ 300 a year for the old software, since we don‚Äôt everything can be cooked in the new.  And it turns out that the company with which we previously worked could not get permission to develop software for maintaining ED, although there it is enough to add data upload in xml and add a complex for creating EDS (although this is like third-party software) and sending data via the Internet to customs. <br><br><h5>  Electronic keys </h5><br>  Also, to ensure the functioning of the entire scheme, it is necessary to buy electronic keys to form an EDS, and here we were waiting for an exciting game ‚Äúfind me‚Äù, almost a detective story with a search for contacts of an organization selling keys.  Receiving the keys and paying them were also adventurous. <br><br><h5>  Transactions </h5><br>  But it‚Äôs not all that software manufacturers earn, a company pays $ 0.9 for sending a single document (transaction) over the Internet to customs, $ 200-300 runs in a month, the amount is not large but too much to maintain servers and infrastructure. <br><br><h5>  Results </h5><br>  In comparison with software giants (and not just giants), of course, a trifle, but in all this some things are annoying: <br><ul><li>  Explicit promotion of one office and in fact killing competitors and the subsequent monopolization of the software market in the customs sector. </li><li>  Setting up the implementation process, there is no way to centrally prepare enterprises and transparently show what they need to do to implement, so all the information reaches the final performers at the very last moment and through third parties with distortions.  Indeed, in many areas of economic activity, digital signature and centralized data collection have been used for a long time, they could study possible rakes ... </li><li>  Cost: Yes, for the enterprise, in fact, the amount is insignificant, but in the conditions when even because of small payments it is necessary to find an alternative and confirm that you did not overpay, it looks like a mockery </li></ul><br><h4>  2010 has come </h4><br>  But no one is going to stop at this, and the company continues to pay for its own ‚Äúgood faith‚Äù, according to the new rules, it is necessary to throw another form in xml onto customs through the Internet.  And all would be nothing, but again a new software for $ 400 and additional charges for data transfer.  At the same time, although with a discount, a software complex of 2 parts is offered, of which only one part will be used, but annual maintenance will be further charged for both parts.  It is impossible to split the software or transfer using the existing software the xml file created by yourself  Software is also purchased for the possibility of transferring an additional form. <br><br>  There are also positive moments, unlike client banks, that the software is multiplatform and can be saved on the operating system, not feeding Mirosoft, but even then there wasn‚Äôt a tarry spoon that crossed all the advantages - the new additional software is <i>based on the use of development tools Delphi, a high-performance FireBird database server and FastReport report generation system</i> and information transfer software over the Internet, also under Windows. <br><br>  These are the features of the introduction of electronic document management in some areas of the Belarusian economy.  I understand that customs activity is a complex and responsible process, but nowadays, complexes for electronic document circulation via the Internet are being introduced everywhere and there are no such exactions, although it may not have adopted best practices.  Although companies working for other government agencies also like to sell access to the web form as a separate software, but the prices are divine and are already being corrected by providing new functionality for free. <br><br>  It is interesting how things are in the spaces of the former USSR and not only, with such ‚Äúpromotion‚Äù.  For example, a lot has been written about tenders with the development of websites in Russia, but what about the state-of-the-art workflow software? <br><br>  <i>PS: Transferred from the sandbox with additions and changes.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/91046/">https://habr.com/ru/post/91046/</a></p>
