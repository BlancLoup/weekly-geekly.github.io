At the same time, the accuracy of optical monitoring is comparable to an ECG: this is what the manufacturer of the bracelet says after numerous tests.  In general, Mio Fuse is a smart gift for a man who regularly goes to the gym and wants to work on a pulse tracking program. <a name="habracut"></a>

With daily classes lasting up to an hour, the Fuse battery will last for a week.  The tracker is synchronized with the two most popular mobile operating systems (iOS, Android), so it is important to make sure that the future gift-holder‚Äôs smartphone is not running Windows Phone. <br><br>  <a href="http://madrobots.ru/catalog/zdorove_2_0/mio-fuse/"><b>Mio Fuse Pulsometer in Madrobots.ru</b></a> <br><br><h4>  Backpack Thule Crossover TCBP-317 </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b49/95e/acd/b4995eacd1a1422e81a184405d75f9fb.png"><br><br>  A real gadget man always carries his devices with him, but putting them in a regular bag is suicide: the risk of getting a tablet with a broken screen or a hopelessly tangled cord from charging is too great.  Thule developed a special geek backpack, which, despite its rather modest capacity (25 liters), will hold all the necessary devices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a50/048/20f/a5004820fe014c51bb3af4bdd95ba2b3.jpg"><br><br>  The main compartment of the Crossover TCBP-317 is a laptop: this compartment was originally designed for the MacBook Pro, but another laptop with a screen up to 15 inches will fit in there.  The second compartment is given to the tablet (by default with a 10-inch diagonal).  Of course, between the gadgets there is a layer that will not allow the devices to fight against each other.  In the third compartment, it is proposed to transfer charges, and for the smartphone, the SafeZone unit has been designed: thanks to the solid construction, the device is guaranteed complete safety.  However, if someone is used to carry the phone in his pocket, SafeZone quickly removed, increasing the free space of the backpack. <br><br>  <a href="http://madrobots.ru/catalog/raznoe/ryukzak-thule-crossover-tcbp-317-25-litrov/"><b>Backpack Thule Crossover TCBP-317 at Madrobots.ru</b></a> <br><br><h4>  Master of Posture </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d45/706/0bd/d457060bd35e4ca8aba61fe75cc686f4.jpg"><br><br>  A few years ago, one of the most truthful demotivators in history reached the peak of popularity: ‚ÄúDo you read this text?  Stop holding your chin with your left hand.  And straighten your back. "  The typical position of a person who studies news on the Internet, kills the spine: first, pain occurs sporadically, and then becomes permanent. <br><br>  "Master posture" - an effective proofreader for those who practice a sedentary lifestyle.  The device is attached to clothing (or directly to the body) and with the help of the built-in accelerometer it inspects the level of spinal curvature.  As soon as it becomes critical, the timer turns on, and in a minute the ‚ÄúMaster‚Äù starts to vibrate, calling for it to straighten up.  Such unobtrusive but systematic reminders are much more effective than the rare advice of relatives urging not to stoop in front of the monitor. <br><br>  <a href="http://madrobots.ru/catalog/zdorove_2_0/master-osanki/"><b>Master of Posture in Madrobots.ru</b></a> <br><br><h4>  Sensu Brush Stylus </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6ad/7f7/c28/6ad7f7c28a5e4da1a282405e8d9b8c21.jpg"><br>  Tablets on iOS and Android have quite a few usage scenarios, but until recently, drawing was not one of them: drawing something highly artistic would not work with a finger, and the usual stylus is only suitable for sketches.  The stylish digital brush Sensu Brush adds another function to the gadget: the screen turns into a picture canvas. <br><br>  Due to the conductive fiber (the pile is made of it), Sensu Brush is also suitable for complex patterns: the sensations from touching the screen are the same as from touching a normal brush to a canvas.  Additional advantages: no need to recharge and a cap that turns the brush into a stylus for capacitive displays. <br><br>  <a href="http://madrobots.ru/catalog/aksessuary_dlya_ios_i_android/sensu-brush/"><b>Sensu Brush Stylus in Madrobots.ru</b></a> <br><br><h4>  Zendure 4-Port </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/365/f99/a87/365f99a87c5f4a6e81fb0e6a81f15c44.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The bed of adapters sticking out of the socket quickly begins to irritate: it is more convenient to distribute energy to gadgets using a single charger.  Zendure 4-Port - from this category: a stylish square-shaped device is equipped with a quartet of USB cable inputs.  The device from Zendure weighs only 200 grams: you can take it on any trip to be able to charge your smartphone and tablet at the same time, and not wait until the adapter is free. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/138/abc/fb0/138abcfb00754cc59d913b011b0d8128.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But the main function of 4-Port is a panel for wireless charging.  There can be placed as smartphones that support this feature (models of Nokia, Motorola, LG, HTC), and other devices (including the iPhone).  However, for the second option you need an external Qi-receiver, which is not included in the kit. <br><br>  <a href="http://madrobots.ru/catalog/aksessuary_dlya_ios_i_android/besprovodnoe-zaryadnoe-ustroystvo-zendure/"><b>Zendure 4-Port at Madrobots.ru</b></a> <br><br><h4>  JBL OnBeat Mini lighting </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8c2/600/707/8c26007073164e5095d9b7bea313dc15.png"><br><br>  A compact speaker with two powerful broadband speakers is a great gift for a music lover who uses Apple devices.  OnBeat Mini works with all devices from Cupertino, released in the fall of 2012 or later (the main thing is the lighting connector).  The gadget from JBL can play the role of a docking station (charging) or play music from another audio device via a 3.5mm cable. <br><br>  From one charge, the speaker gives an 8-hour concert, and the current battery fullness level is indicated by an LED indicator.  OnBeat Mini is a useful thing not only at a party, but also in everyday life: it is obvious that listening to jazz from the speaker is more pleasant than from the speaker of the iPhone. <br><br>  <a href="http://madrobots.ru/catalog/portativnaya_akustika/dok-stantsiya-jbl-onbeat-mini-lightning/"><b>JBL OnBeat Mini lighting in Madrobots.ru</b></a> <br><br><h4>  Harman Kardon AE </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/874/55d/8db/87455d8db3f249e19db9c24768e6cdd0.png"><br><br>  The design of headphones with an aluminum alloy body was designed specifically for those iPhone owners who want to look ultramodern.  "Gags" involuntarily evoke associations with films about the future, but the appearance is far from the only plus of Harman Kardon. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d99/1ef/c11/d991efc115a9483087349970a9156f3c.png"><br><br>  Headphones are equipped with a thunder switch, a 1.2-meter-long wire and a case included in the kit.  Also, Harman Kardon AE can operate in the range of 16-20000 Hz and can boast ear pads that do not cause discomfort at all. <br><br>  <a href="http://madrobots.ru/catalog/raznoe/naushniki-harman-kardon-ae/"><b>Harman Kardon AE at Madrobots.ru</b></a> <br><br>  Author: <a href="https://twitter.com/gorodnitskiy">Pavel Gorodnitsky</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/366281/">https://habr.com/ru/post/366281/</a></p>
