      NAME <br><br>  When a development or a company enters a new market for the first time, it itself declares its name, with which everyone will associate it later, which will then be called, and under which it will be remembered (if they will). <br>  If this name is chosen unsuccessfully and incorrectly, it will work not against the development / company, but against it. <br>  The main naming errors are well known and repeatedly described. <br><br>  - Lack of memorization of the name, that is, the name - does not work as a name <br>  CI.PA (I had to change to Kiton) <br>  NM Electronics (had to be changed to Intel) <br>  Lucky Goldstar (I had to change to LG) <br>  Bit Software (had to change to ABBYY) <br>  Computer Terminal Corporation (had to be changed to Datapoint) <br>  etc. <br><br>  - Neutrality for target market language <br>  For the Russian-speaking market of the Russian Federation, classical examples are Pedrini tableware, Pukala tea, Bledina baby food, Perdera wine, Vidal Sassoon shampoo and other marketers' jokes. <br><br>  - Unnecessary and interfering lengths <br>  Bayerische Motoren Werke (I had to change to BMW) <br>  International Business Machines Corporation (had to change to IBM) <br>  Advanced Micro Devices (had to change to AMD) <br>  etc. <br>  Special chic is the length in combination with transliteration <br>  In the early 90s, when former Soviet organizations tried to enter the foreign market, some foreign contractors received letters with caps containing threatening images of Lenin and flags, and inscriptions like: "... <i>ordenov Kutuzova and Trudovogo Krasnogo znameni Nauchno-Proizvodstvennoe Obyedinenie imeni akademika</i> .. ". <br>  But the translation of such names looked even worse. <br><br>  At the same time, a good and bright name, sometimes - can literally pull a product or service out of a number of similar but gray counterparts. <br>  So the success of the TIRAMISU data recovery utility was not least due to its unusual and memorable name, which, despite the Japanese language, had nothing to do with Japan, since it was the name of an Italian cream cake. <br>  Replacing the endless faceless numbers in the name of Pentium - played a significant role in the confrontation of AMD vs Intel. <br>  And the name Panasonic turned out to be so successful and memorable that they completely renamed the huge company with a ninety-year (!) History. <br><br>  To come up with or pick up a bright and memorable name for a product / service / company is not easy, but possible. <br>  However, this is already beyond the scope of this post. <br><br>  In addition to the above, the most common mistake of developers and companies from the Russian Federation is their unwillingness to check the invented beautiful name for uniqueness. <br>  People spend a lot of time drawing curlicues and picking colors, instead of literally checking in three minutes whether the coined name can be used to designate a product or even a company. <br><br>  Verification is very simple. <br>  - Google search: <a href="http://www.google.com/">www.google.com</a> <br>  - Check on the largest database of word brands: <br>  <a href="">USA</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.wipo.int/romarin/searchAction.do%3Bjsessionid%3D946423167587051A677B6C5DF4D3B4FE">Wipo</a> <br><br>  If search queries are non-empty, the name will have to be changed when entering the external market, and the later it happens, the more expensive it will be, so it‚Äôs better to immediately pick up a new name, and of course check it immediately. <br>  The best thing is to create and construct a completely new word that has no connection with the already known ones, such as Google, Skype, ABBYY, etc. <br>  In this case, novelty is guaranteed, and with proper design - brightness and memorability, which is required of the name. <br><br>  GRAPHIC SIGN <br><br>  With a graphical " <i>name</i> ", things are a little simpler; it is enough to draw a simple but memorable picture. <br>  Pairs of Samsung vs Intel logos, Rosnano vs Total, Rostelecom vs PetroFrontier, <br>  Jaguar vs Puma, Adidas vs Huawei, etc.  show that designers often save money, although it‚Äôs not a fact that it contributes to the achievement of the main goal of these logos - memorizing and distinguishing products and companies. <br>  With a generous riot of colors it is worth remembering that in 95% of cases the mark / logo will be used on paper, in black and white notation, where all the colors / halftones / transitions and small details will disappear. <br>  There is one company that has chosen a bitten apple with its logo, and which calmly puts this apple on its products, without even bothering to paint it in any color or write next to its name, since everyone already understands whose products they are dealing with. <br>  However, this company and from its name squeezed all 100%. <br>  At a time when " <i>International Business Machines Corporation</i> ", " <i>Control Data Corporation</i> ", " <i>Digital Equipment Corporation</i> ", " <i>Nippon Electric Corporation</i> ", and other monsters with the name in three lines, reigned in the market, she took the ridiculous name of five letters which immediately separated and separated her and her products from everything else, which greatly facilitated marketing. <br>  This is the function of the logo - instant recognition by minimal features. <br>  But Samsung, which once saved it on designers, doesn‚Äôt work out, and now, for its own identification, it‚Äôs always necessary to put a crutch with its own name directly on its sign, otherwise it willn‚Äôt be recognized by its logo. <br><br>  A separate direction of graphic signs are icons, icons and shortcuts to programs, which also make their own contribution to the convenience or inconvenience of a quick search on the screen and the identification of the desired application. <br>  However, this is more related not to naming, but to ergonomics and usability. <br><br>  CHECK IN <br><br>  If the selected name and picture are seemingly normal, and have no visible analogs, you can immediately " <i>take</i> " them (not to register, but prepare the registration, and make it so that no one else can register them). <br>  Trademark registrations vary from country to country and are different (in terms of timing, price and details of the procedure), but there are some common and universal solutions. <br>  You can ‚Äú <i>take</i> ‚Äù a textual name by registering it as a domain in all major domain zones of the Internet. <br>  This will make it possible to prepare for the official registration of this name in all relevant jurisdictions, and most importantly - for its subsequent real use in business in the shortest possible time and with minimal expenses. <br>  A picture logo can be ‚Äú <i>taken</i> ‚Äù by organizing ‚Äú <i>fact of use</i> ‚Äù, for which it is enough to release any print advertisements with this picture in selected countries for subsequent business or enter the catalog of any regional or better international exhibition with it (in the exhibition itself you can‚Äôt to participate, the main thing is to enter the catalog). <br>  At the same time, however, it must be remembered that signs are always and everywhere registered for specific classes of goods and services, therefore a sign for shoes means ‚Äú <i>to occupy</i> ‚Äù advertising shoes, not furniture, and signs for furniture advertising furniture, not shoes, and so on. d. <br><br>  The official registration itself - the procedure is very simple and purely formal, presents no difficulties, and only the unexpectedly large amount of fees is remembered. <br>  However, if the step of choosing / selecting / constructing a name and a logo described earlier was done poorly (in 95% of cases it was completely omitted), at the stage of official registration, when checking for " <i>distinguishing ability</i> " (uniqueness and recognition), the problem of " <i>similarity to the degree of confusion</i> "with already known names and images, and then you have to either long (and expensive) to argue with the officials of the registering agency, or - to terminate the whole procedure, abandon the process (losing everything already paid) and return to the outcome  The first step is choosing a unique name and drawing a unique picture. <br><br>  So there is nothing difficult in this area - attentiveness and accuracy, and everything will be fine. <br><br>  =============================================== <br><br>  Further: <br>  - " <i>Individualization errors</i> " <br>  - " <i><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/143290/">Disclosure Errors</a></i> " <br>  -
