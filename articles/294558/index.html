I want to touch on a very important topic - how much is the creation of the site and why it is so much. <br><br>  At first glance, the site development market is oversaturated, only in Tomsk at the moment there are about 150 organizations and their number is growing very rapidly, however those who have encountered the problem of choosing an artist at least once in their life know that normal developers can be counted on the fingers of one experienced hand milling machine.  Anticipating - yes, T-studio is cool, we consider ourselves to be ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. <br><br>  Take an example - you have a small company that buys things in China and resells them in Tomsk.  For a long time you worked through groups in social networks, a certain client base has accumulated, which is increasing at quite a good pace and you are tired of constantly responding in messages what size is available, what has already been sold, what will soon be available, etc.  The solution is obvious - you need your own website, where your entire assortment will be with the ability to order, pay, ask a question, in general, it looks like a fairly standard online store.  You drive into the search engine ‚Äúwebsite creation in Tomsk‚Äù or open 2Gis, send your request to everyone and look forward to it ... About half of you will not answer at all, because these were the guys who decided to ‚Äúmake websites‚Äù, added themselves to 2Gis, but ... "The kid went to success, did not work, did not fartanulo" (c).  There are no orders and they have long been engaged in another business.  Another quarter will answer you when you have already chosen your performer.  They are probably very busy to respond to incoming requests.  The bottom line is to get about 15-20 sentences.

      The price range will turn out just shocking, from 5 000r.  up to 3 500 000 rub.  Most likely you will choose something close to the bottom line, but not the cheapest, a studio that does not have the worst portfolio, thousands for 25 000 - 30 000 rub.  and they have already made several similar stores, with the thought ‚Äúyes, for 1 500 000 of course they do very cool, but I do not need something outstanding, for 25 there is a normal option‚Äù.  This is logical, we all want to save money and it is not clear why I have to pay 3,500,000 when there are more profitable offers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Let's try to understand why such a range of prices and why it is impossible to get a good result for 30 thousand.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2db/684/8ca/2db6848cab6a4bd1abe3d35f1e10033e.png" alt="image"><br><br>  It looks simple - turning into a studio, you rent its employees by stages for several months and the whole sum is made up of the number of personnel involved multiplied by the number of hours spent and the cost of an hour.  In turn, the cost of an hour includes all expenses, wages, risks and margin. <br><br>  The largest impact on the cost is the number of employees involved, in each company you will receive a different set of services.  For those 25-30 thousand, you will get a website on a template and a free control system like Wordpress or Joomla, which will somehow work and at best will not bring you any customers, and at worst - will scare away, because in 30 thousand it is unlikely 20 specialists will work for several weeks or months. <br><br>  Just want to note that there is a category of sites for which this is quite a tolerable option - this is called ‚Äúa site for the sake of a site‚Äù.  If your slogan ‚Äúwe all have it and we should have it,‚Äù this sample solution will be fine for you. <br><br>  <b>Let's step back a bit and go back to our store example.</b> <br><br>  You chose the option for 30 thousand, you ended up with a store on a free management system and a modified template design.  You had a lot of quarreling with the performers, because in 90% of cases the deadlines were frustrated, the result was not at all what you expected and the work was handed over.  For 30,000, these 1-2 people who made the site are not interested in your sales, in their reputation, but in general except for your money, because they need to exist, they are now ‚Äúbusinessmen‚Äù and ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt work for their uncle ":) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/df5/536/d07/df5536d077c14c0eb443671c3061b7e9.png" alt="image"><br><br>  And here you have a store, it‚Äôs possible to add goods and you can buy them, but nobody buys anything and visits the site.  No one knows about you, and those who accidentally log in - very quickly close the site and the percentage of failures reaches 80-90%.  It is very inconvenient to work with the site - the dimensions are different for one product cannot be created, no upload is provided, the text does not change everywhere, etc.  etc.  The problem is that it is done on CMS and it does not provide for more and no one thought about the design, it was simply drawn by incompetent people or a template was downloaded at all. <br><br>  <b>We are approaching the end ...</b> <br><br>  You can not make a working online store cheaper 150-200 thousand.  This is the lower bound.  Why? <br><br>  You need to clearly analyze your business.  Understand your target audience, its behavior, habits.  Considering this, design the structure, usability, make prototypes of all pages and elements, place accents, laying the fundamentals of marketing and the psychology of buyer behavior.  Draw the design of the entire site, including at first glance inconspicuous things such as icons and other small things that have great meaning.  Give all the text to copywriters, what would they put them in order.  Make an adaptive layout or just a different display for different devices, backed by its trendy solutions.  Program the entire Backend site, test the site on real data, optimize its work.  Make SEO-optimization, think about how to further promote your website, where to advertise, what steps to take. <br><br>  All this will take about two months of work by more than ten specialists from different fields.  How much can it cost?  Using our studio as an example, we‚Äôll get an amount of about 200-300 thousand at the moment, but we are growing and developing and the cost is growing. <br><br>  To a person who has never faced the creation of sites before may seem like a lot.  This year, T-Studio received a pack of diplomas for the development of online stores.  We occupy the 9th place in Siberia and 74 in Russia.  With one interesting amendment - in the lower price segment.  The whole rating was divided into 4 main parts, 4 price segments: <br><br><ul><li>  premium - shops worth from 1.5 million </li><li>  top - from 750 thousand to 1.5 million </li><li>  average - from 200 to 750 thousand </li><li>  lower - up to 200 thousand </li></ul><br>  Our studio in the lower price segment.  The Russian rating considers that for 200 thousand it is possible to do only shops on templates. <br><br>  Why do others do for 1.5 million what we do for 300 thousand?  We return to the formula "the number of personnel involved, multiplied by the number of hours spent and the cost per hour."  If we have 10 people doing your site, then in another studio 50 and the complex of services provided will be much wider.  Most often, their cost includes full further support, advertising budgets, corporate identity, brand withdrawal and positioning, naming, etc. <br><br>  And not the last role is played in pricing, as in any sphere, the brand of the studio itself and its experience.  After all, we are selling exactly our experience, speaking experts in this field.  Hence the formation of the cost per hour employee.  Small companies are ready to work for 200 rubles per hour, so long as there are customers and ‚Äúfood‚Äù.  Big market players sell their brains much more expensive :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ceb/c28/ef4/cebc28ef499445688ac42235e4061af7.png" alt="image"><br><br>  And of course the number of hours depends on the functionality that you need.  Each customer includes a different set of features in the same terms. <br><br>  <b>First results</b> <br><br>  No matter how trite it may sound, in most cases, the cost of development is directly proportional to the result and the savings are not relevant here.  You can spend 300 thousand, and the site will work for you, becoming an additional business tool, easy to use, refinement, which ultimately will pay off very quickly.  Or do you spend first 30 thousand on the site, then another 30 to refine it, 20 to optimize, 40 to promote and advertise, and eventually after a year or two, order a normal website anyway, because what you did before Of this, no one will modify. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cc4/8e6/c8a/cc48e6c8acfa4149b514341ec309d113.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Always check with the contractor what exactly they will do for the money, look carefully at their portfolios, how they accomplished similar tasks and if possible, communicate with customers.  Just talk, we are perfectly aware that you need to listen to the reviews, not read. <br><br>  Of course there are exceptions in the form of studios, which ask for a lot of money for frank poop, but our small tips will help to avoid such comrades as much as possible. <br><br>  Most often, start-up entrepreneurs, like our example, forget that it‚Äôs not enough to make a website - it needs to be made convenient, functional, promote, advertise, set up a huge business process with it connected, hone logistics and constantly maintain.  In support, we include ongoing refinement.  You can't make a candy right away, inevitably, in the course of using a bunch of functionality, it is replayed, the project acquires new possibilities. <br><br>  <b>Well, finally finalechka</b> <br><br>  Remember that almost any company, not only studios, go through several stages of formation: <br><br>  We work if only there was money, we undertake any work and ridiculous cost. <br>  We work not for money, but for reputation, sometimes doing work at a loss or for free. <br>  Gaining experience, stuffing cones begin to do more or less worth things. <br>  Go more expensive orders because  already have experience and company on hearing.  We do not undertake extra work, we do what we can and we are constantly improving. <br>  Experts in their field.  The main goal is to make cool and comfortable things, and the money is now just a big, nice bonus to the product being released.  As a result, the project costs are very high, the studio is very busy and popular. <br>  90% of the development market is at the first stage and never cross it, these ‚Äúcompanies‚Äù close earlier.  It is from here that such a range of prices and all the slogans ‚Äúwebsite for 5 000‚Äù, ‚Äúshop for 9 999r.‚Äù And new-fashioned ‚Äúselling pages with a guarantee of conversion‚Äù.  They just sell them to you. <br><br>  T-Studio has just moved to the fourth stage and is being improved, and maybe even at the very end of the third.  Companies offering solutions worth more than 1 million.  rubles have long been in the fifth :) <br><br>  That's all. <br><br>  Have we figured out how much the site is worth?  I think yes.  There are no exact figures, each project is unique, but there is an understanding that it is not cheap and for 20 000 rub.  you are trying to "push" the frank Kaku. <br><br>  How to choose the right studio?  Carefully analyze your portfolio, communicate with former and current customers, search for it in popular ratings and search for information. <br><br>  Can there be a studio with an impeccable reputation?  There is nothing wrong with that either.  There are always clients with whom there are disagreements in the process of work.  For various reasons, there is no point in listing. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> <br><br>  I would also like to add that most customers argue on the principle of ‚Äúmore - better‚Äù, creating extra functionality and occupying useful space on the site, producing lots of unnecessary text, reducing indents, etc. <br><br>  In fact, to make a simple and intuitive interface is much more difficult than pile up a mess of elements, pictures and icons.  And the ‚Äúair‚Äù on the site is now in trend :) <br><br>  ‚ÄúGood design is the absence of design‚Äù (c) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294558/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294558/</a></p>
