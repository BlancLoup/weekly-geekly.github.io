How? <br><br>  Very simple: no spammer will pay you to read his letter.  But to <b>pay for the first cold contact with the person that you need is desperate for you</b> - many are ready. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Description of the problem </h5><br>  I, like many others, have several e-mail accounts, a couple of accounts in the social networks and something else.  I have already forgotten a hundred times what subscriptions I subscribed to and what password is needed to remove me from the subscribe-list.  Simply press "del".

      This is fixable, but what is important is that there is always a stream of new people eager for communication.  And you cannot hide your contacts, because you need this too.  That's just a part of the letters I want to delete immediately, after which it turns out that the person you need wrote ‚Äúnot from that box‚Äù or forgot to specify the topic. <br><br>  The same thing is with millions.  My letters and messages are also lost in the dump of others like them.  From someone with whom communication is only made.  This is lost time and nerves. <br><br>  Again you send a letter that gets into spam and they knock you on Skype and ask: did you send me a message or is it a virus ?! <br><br>  In fact, it is often not even the case that they do not want to communicate with you, but that there is no confidence in a person on the other side of the screen. <br><br>  On the other hand, it happens that your mega-idea can be understood only by the very guru whose work you have been inspiring all these years, but he is unlikely to read your message and really be interested.  Even if the profile says "I look forward to your ideas."  Thousands of people like you.  Everyday. <br><br>  Problem?  Even some.  There is a crisis of communications and distrust of the sender, when in the flow of information noise you often lose all the most important things.  So far it concerns only 1% of Internet users.  Until. <br><br>  And the creators of the service found a solution. <br><br><h5>  The basic principles of "my attention" </h5><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/f0218bb9/a2435193/3c2139d9/e0aa616b.jpg"><ol><li>  Payment for the first contact.  Then you can add a person to your list of personal acquaintances. </li><li>  Only ‚Äúclean‚Äù contacts.  Checking people through, for example, social media accounts that check the authenticity profiles of famous people. </li><li>  The higher the fee, the higher your message in the recipient‚Äôs list according to the auction principle. </li><li>  Money can be returned to the sender or sent to charity. </li><li>  Tracking whether sent messages are really delivered and read.  It's a shame to pay and not get anything. </li><li>  Based on paragraph 3 - the ranking of people.  The peculiar PeopleRank of those who are really open to contacts and can solve your problem. </li></ol><br><h5>  Audience of users </h5><br>  Initially, the creators of the project focused on the <a href="http://attn.me/">foreign market</a> .  There, people are used to paying for consultations and simply for being able to contact the right people. <br><br>  The author of the project, Mikhail Petrakov, has been living in the USA for half a year, working on options and communicating with technical experts and investors in the Silicon Valley. <br><br>  Not so long ago, the guys launched the Russian version of the service.  And here is the main snag: Runet is not ready to pay.  Only by spending 10-15 minutes to communicate with a person can you convey how good the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãorganizing a first contact is with the help of the proposed system. <br><br>  I volunteered to help.  As a result, we decided that in RuNet such a service could be useful in a narrow niche - for communication between startups and investors.  The first are willing to pay for communication, the second - to evaluate fresh ideas.  All this saves time and makes even simple business communication. <br>  Existing Tasks <br>  Like many startups, there are a lot of tasks that need to be solved: to work out the interface, write uniquely clear and selling texts, invite famous people ... <br><br>  We have already conducted a primary audit of the service and outlined the necessary improvements.  The list is constantly increasing, as new project participants are attracted.  But‚Ä¶ <br><br>  From the people who communicate on Habr√©, the future of Runet largely depends.  We really want to make this service useful for people and improve it.  In this regard, any criticism and tips on finalizing the product are very important for us to understand that our thoughts about finalizing certain points are indeed correct. <br><br>  <b>We count on the help of the community.</b> <br><br>  Do you think we chose the right niche for the Runet project? <br><br>  To what charitable purposes to enable users to transfer the proceeds from the sale of their attention?  (treatment of children, Greenpeace, etc ...) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/119125/">https://habr.com/ru/post/119125/</a></p>
