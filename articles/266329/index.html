      At Rubyconf 2014, Matz said that one of the focuses of Ruby 3 will be competitive support.  The makings of this already appear in the form of gems - for example, <a href="https://github.com/ruby-concurrency/concurrent-ruby">concurrent-ruby</a> , which is already used in the insides of Rail.  I think that now it will become one of the tasks in the development of the language;  Without good competition support, Ruby may have no future. <br>  As for Rails, I am glad that over the past year, alternatives to the rail stack have appeared: for example, Lotus and ROM.  Adaptation of alternative frameworks at the community level will help open the eyes of the developers and tell them that in addition to the rails there is something else: other approaches and other paradigms. <br><br><br>  <b>What is missing in Rails?</b> <br><br>  Inside Rails, that's enough.  In the fall there will still include ActionCable.  What is missing is greater modularity.  It is possible, but nobody uses it - how many friends do you have who use Sequel or ROM instead of ActiveRecord? <br>  I think that the popularity of competitors could give rails an incentive to rewrite monolithic components, such as ActiveRecord. <br><br><br>  <b>Favorite programming language after Ruby, why him?</b> <br><br>  Previously, I really liked Go, but after I saw Clojure, my opinion about Go changed :) Clojure bribed me with a beautiful syntax, REPL presence and a functional approach.  After the experience with Clojure, it even became a little painful to look at the code on Go.  For me, the main minus of Clojure is that this language is less popular in production than Go, so I don‚Äôt have any idea how to use it in a combat project. <br><br><br>  <b>What technology do you think will be the most promising in the near future?</b> <br><br>  I feel that 70 percent of developers from the Rails Core Team - and other authoritative developers - are wildly fan of Rust.  I think that he will reach a certain audience as soon as he becomes stable.  Although some lack of stability does not stop - for example, Yehuda Katz already uses it in its <a href="https://github.com/skylightio/skylight-ruby">Skylight</a> service. <br><br><br>  <b>What is open source for you?</b>  <b>What projects are you participating in and why?</b> <br><br>  Open Source and Gitkhab provide an opportunity to work together with very talented people who have something to learn. <br>  1% of developers create frameworks, and 99% consume them.  Besides, it's nice when you know that your code runs on a thousand machines. <br><br><br>  <b>Favorite resources (blogs / sites / twitter) on web development and programming?</b> <br><br>  I am closely following the work of <a href="https://twitter.com/schneems">Richard Schneeman</a> , the author of derailed, a set of benchmarking tools for rail applications.  He also recently <a href="http://www.schneems.com/blogs/2015-08-06-patching-rails-performance/">optimized the response time in Rails by almost 10%</a> . <br>  I can recommend <a href="https://rails-weekly.ongoodbits.com/">This Week in Rails</a> newsletter - it contains all the interesting bugs and pull requests in Rails for the week. <br><br><br>  <b>Best read book on programming / technology?</b> <br><br>  Definitely <a href="http://patshaughnessy.net/ruby-under-a-microscope">Ruby Under a Microscope</a> , which gives an excellent understanding of the data structures in the language, and how they are implemented in MRI, JRuby and Rubinius. <br><br><br>  <b>What advice would you give to developers who want to achieve great success?</b> <br><br>  Ruby and rails have many magical things that work out of the box, immediately after adding a heme to a project.  Many developers are so happy about this that they don‚Äôt even think about how it actually works. <br>  It seems to me that if we read the source codes of gems rather than google or read the documentation, we would be much more knowledgeable about the subject area. <br>  Therefore, the advice is that every time you have a question, feel free to dial the bundle open gem and read the source code.  And do not be afraid to read the source of the rail :) <br><br><br>  <b>Not tired of programming?</b> <br><br>  I'm tired.  The last six months I try to move away from programming as much as possible in my spare time.  I'm going to go to carpentry courses and start making furniture.  In my free time I like to cook, and in July my colleague and I traveled a thousand kilometers on bicycles through Germany and Denmark. <br><br><br>  <b>What would you do if you had 2 months of free paid time?</b> <br><br>  I have been going to port the ActiveRecord Attributes API for a long time already inside ActiveModel, so that the typecasting and multiple attributes can finally be added to ActiveModel.  Now for this you need to use a third-party gem - for example, <a href="https://github.com/solnic/virtus">virtus</a> .  This would allow even better to pump Form Objects in the default composition of Rails. <br><br>  I would also try to write my own, modern solution for storing files in Ruby applications.  It seems to me that now the community lacks such a solution, because Carrierwave is outdated (it was written for Merb in 2008), and the new <a href="https://github.com/refile/refile">Refile</a> has an excellent architecture, but its file processing is far from ideal. <br><br>  I already made the first attempt (see <a href="https://github.com/kirs/storage">Storage</a> ), but came across architecture problems, decided to rewrite everything, but did not find time for it. <br><br>  <b>Thank you for the interview and see you at the conference!</b> <br><br>  On September 26th, Cyrus will arrive from Helsinki on RailsCllub.  Full program and registration <a href="http://railsclub.ru/">on our website</a> . <br><br>  At the conference we are waiting for the Russian version of the report of Cyrus from RailsConf 2015 in Atlanta. <br>  Using the beta versions of Rails 4.2, we‚Äôve seen how often performance regressions can occur in the Rails framework, and how easily they can go unnoticed. <br>  The problem of performance and its regressions is becoming more acute in the Ruby community.  It pushed me and other Rails contributors to develop Rubybench, a service for searching regression for performance in Ruby and Rails. <br><br>  In his report, he will review performance regressions with examples of commits from Rails, talk about building benchmarks for Ruby applications, and demonstrate Rubybench and its architecture. <br><br><h4>  Our sponsors </h4><br>  General partner: <b><a href="http://www.toptal.com/">Toptal</a></b> <br>  Gold Partner: <b><a href="https://cloudcastle.ru/">Cloud Castle</a></b> <br>  Silver Partners: <b><a href="http://www.at-consulting.ru/">AT-Consulting</a></b> and <b><a href="https://www.honeybadger.io/">Honeybadger</a></b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/966/7a9/cb8/9667a9cb836dbd0221446dde5330bc6a.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b><a href="https://www.honeybadger.io/">Honeybadger</a></b> is a service that monitors the exception, uptime and performance of your applications.
