It ended for the company extremely positively - the first billion quarter and record revenue for the whole year.  A <a href="http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/pdfs/201012/Q410Earnings.pdf">press release</a> , detailed <a href="http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/invrelations/pdfs/q410_ir_datasheet.pdf">figures</a> and <a href="http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/invrelations/10q4analyst/earnings_confcall.html">call recording</a> with investors with a presentation are available on the company's website. <br><br>  The main speaker was CEO of the company Shantanu Narayen.  He said that Adobe is a leader in providing solutions for creating, managing, delivering and optimizing digital content.  At the same time, the company is successfully transforming into a more diversified one.  Let me remind you that traditionally it is believed that almost all of the profits Adobe receives from its copyright to create content.

      Gartner has placed Adobe in its magic quadrants as a leader in the business process and web content management segment. <br>  Over the past quarter, record revenue (revenue) was <strong>$ 1.008 billion</strong> , up <strong>33%</strong> from a year earlier.  Record revenue for the whole year was <strong>$ 3.8 billion</strong> , which is <strong>29%</strong> higher than last year.  It is interesting to note that the net income of this quarter was $ 268.9 million, whereas a year earlier there was a net loss of $ 32 million. The company came out of the crisis very confidently. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Last year, Adobe acquired <a href="http://www.omniture.com/en/">Omniture</a> (now creating the Adobe online marketing suite), and in this, <a href="http://www.day.com/day/en.html">Day Software</a> , which stores and manages content.  Without these units, Adobe increased by 18% over the year.  In total, 9117 people work for the company at the moment, having increased by 402 in the last quarter (179 of them came from Day). <br><br>  Like most other leaders of the IT market, the company receives most of its profits in the Americas - 49% (let me remind you that Google receives 52% of profits in the US alone).  EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) gives 32%, Asia - 19%. <br><br>  As for the breakdown by segments, the undisputed leader remains Creative and Interactive Solutions, which includes products such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere, Dreamweaver, Flash and others.  The main results of the year was the release of the fifth version of the package Creative Suite and Flash Player 10.1.  This brought $ 542.1 million in revenue in the fourth quarter, which is slightly less than the third quarter.  Narayen noted that over the year, the number of designers and developers using Adobe tools doubled, and the company did not feel the negative impact of the well-known Apple decision (about Flash).  Moreover, he believes that the importance of cross-platform is only increasing, which has a positive effect on Adobe. <br><br>  In the business solutions segment, Acrobat X was released and solutions from Day acquired appeared.  The result - $ 274.1 million in the last quarter. <br><br>  The integration of Omniture into the company has been successfully completed.  Over the year, more than $ 1 billion was spent on advertising by customers, and requests for use were a record (best bookings year ever).  This yielded 1.32 trillion transactions and $ 98.4 million in the last quarter. <br><br>  The platform division, which produces Flash Player, Flex and AIR, earned $ 46.1 million this quarter (which is by the way slightly lower than the crisis of 2009).  The numbers on the spread of AIR is still not called, but the company says the growing popularity of the platform on Android, Blackberry and HP / Palm.  Next year, this unit will enter Creative and Interactive Solutions, which seems logical. <br><br>  Tools for printing and publishing (based on PostScript) brought another $ 47.3 million in the last quarter. <br><br>  For me personally, the most interesting part of company reports are answers to questions from analysts.  However, this time they were purely in the financial plane and practically did not touch the technology.  The not very clear question about the proportion of Adobe funds in the app stores on mobile platforms (App Store, Android Marketplace and others), the company replied that it is difficult to calculate, however, when designing applications, the tools are used in most cases. <br><br>  There were no questions about HTML5 at all (the IT community usually considers this to be a great threat to the company).  Only Narayen himself remembered this, saying that new functions appear in Dreamweaver and Illistrator with his support. <br><br>  In general, the company expects to switch to more frequent releases of its products and increasingly use the subscription model, thus turning its boxed solutions into services.  No concrete plans were voiced, but several times the attention was focused that there would be news soon. <br><br>  The company plans a planned development and gives its own forecast for the next quarter of $ 1.05 billion. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/730/3f7/4cc/7303f74cc150d6db3c1fbad53b5fe874.jpg" width="660" height="156"></a> <br><br>  On stock exchanges on Monday, Adobe shares rose sharply, but if you look at the dynamics from the beginning of the year, it is generally negative.  The company's capitalization today is about $ 15.7 billion. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/110480/">https://habr.com/ru/post/110480/</a></p>
