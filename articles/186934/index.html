It greatly facilitates the work within organizations, as it makes the most of the company's internal infrastructure.  Sync was created to solve the real problems that we face every day when transferring files: restrictions on the size and speed, as well as threats to privacy and security that arise when using cloud technologies. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      So, we are pleased to announce the release of BitTorrent Sync Beta.  Since the release of the first version in April, we received a lot of feedback and know that Sync was used in universities, for transferring footage film, for backup, when writing blogs and managing projects.  Thanks to the people who decided to try our application, we were able to improve and develop it.  Now Sync includes two of the most requested features: support for mobile devices and archiving. <br><br><h2>  Mobile support </h2><br>  You asked - we did.  :) BitTorrent Sync is now available for use on Android devices.  You can synchronize folders selectively or completely, make backup of any folders, and also share files with friends and colleagues directly from your smartphone. <br>  IOS users, we have not forgotten about you.  Keep for updates. <br><br>  We are especially proud of the function of fast file transfer between mobile devices.  No need to create folders and enter secrets.  Simply select the files, and Sync itself will create a virtual folder and generate a QR code (which contains the read only secret for the virtual folder).  When you scan it on another device, Sync will immediately establish a direct connection and start transferring files.  Directly, without limitation of size, at maximum speed between any number of devices. <br><br><h2>  Syncarchive </h2><br>  BitTorrent Sync Beta also includes basic versioning features.  In each folder, a .SyncArchive directory is created, where all previous versions are added when files are changed, as well as files deleted on other devices.  Now you will be able to recover data if they were changed or deleted by mistake. <br><br><h2>  Speed </h2><br>  Speed ‚Äã‚Äãfor us is not an empty word.  A working client is only half the story.  The other half is that it should work fast, consume a minimum of memory and use computer resources efficiently.  We significantly reduced the use of memory and processor, as well as completely revised the internal architecture and changed it to improve performance.  All this, of course, is not just a few new buns, but a fundamental point.  Our application should be fast, small and efficient.  Of course, there are still many areas that need to be improved, and we will constantly work on this. <br><br>  Since April, we also: <br>  - Improved read only sync; <br>  - Expanded settings; <br>  - Added support for FreeBSD; <br>  - Fixed (very) a lot of errors. <br><br>  * Due to changes in the protocol related to mobile device support and versioning, BitTorrent Sync will not be compatible with previous versions.  Please update on all computers. <br><br>  BitTorrent Sync can be downloaded here <a href="http://labs.bittorrent.com/experiments/sync.html">labs.bittorrent.com/experiments/sync.html</a> .  Application for Android is available in Google Play <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.bittorrent.sync">play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bittorrent.sync</a> <br><br>  Many thanks to all our users for helping to make BitTorrent Sync better.  The client was invented and made a team in Minsk, and we are happy to read the opinion of the Habra community about him.  :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/186934/">https://habr.com/ru/post/186934/</a></p>
