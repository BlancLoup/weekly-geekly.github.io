  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What creates masterpieces</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Wikipedia says that "cinema" is a branch of human activity, consisting in the creation of moving images and that it appeared as early as the XIX century.  As the years passed, new chips appeared - then they would add sound, then color, installation will master, then a new special effect will be invented.  Obviously, the film industry did not stand still, however, such a pace of development cannot be called rapid, and, in my opinion, any revolution in such a time period can be considered an evolution. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6e4/dc3/6e2/6e4dc36e2dd174566c1d5653f8877c9c.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Now everything is different - the pace of development and the emergence of new technologies began to grow particularly rapidly.  Regarding the movie, for clarity, you can remember the films of his youth and look at the technical level that is shown on TV now. <br>  At the moment, humanity is going through an important stage in the development of cinemas, I am talking about three-dimensional content.  He is already there, and far from the first day ... but with a clear conscience, putting a tick in front of the story ‚ÄúMovies in 3D‚Äù will be possible only when the viewing process is available without any special means such as glasses.  I think it is over the solution of this problem that the best inventive minds are boiling now ... and while they are boiling, I suggest plunging into the atmosphere of one of the largest film companies - <b><a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/DreamWorks">DreamWorks</a></b> .  On their account a huge number of excellent pictures that do not need to be presented.  Only among the cartoons and fiction is the Soldiers, Shrek, Madagascar, Underwater and woodland, Transformers ... Ah!  Well, quite recently, "How to tame a dragon"! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b84/5aa/f7b/b845aaf7b1b484424d374da7906e6fc9.jpg" alt="image">

Everything is simple - in my opinion, these are the most resource-intensive projects. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b99/36f/60b/b9936f60b7474a4dc258ca823af69906.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Returning to our dragons - only in Russia a new cartoon managed to collect more than 7 million dollars and continues to collect cash.  It is always pleasant to see an interesting romantic story, but few people think that behind another success lies not only the painstaking work of dozens of animators, but also the most advanced technologies. <br><br>  This is what one of the most influential people in Hollywood, head of DreamWorks studio, Jeffrey Katzenberg, spoke to in front of three hundred representatives of industry and journalism in the studio's preliminary screening room: <i>just with the advent of multi-core workstations.</i>  <i>No, seriously, I never thought that I would stand before you and talk about it</i> . ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fd6/d84/351/fd6d843517f4ac896f73b5ac96bc88cf.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Tony Neil-Graves, general manager of the workstation division, talks about how workstations based on the latest Intel Xeon processor models help DreamWorks animators with their work. <br><br>  Some have enough acceptable performance - but not the animators of the Los Angeles office of DreamWorks.  In their work on Dragon, they used specialized workstations equipped with Intel Xeon processors, and a special team of Intel engineers helped animators set up computers for maximum performance when working with graphics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/299/e56/331/299e563312a37dd497e80cd8e38dbb71.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  For example, one of the most common workstations in the studio is the HP <b>Z800</b> series based on Xeon processors.  On board a quad-core processor, 12 memory slots (with the ability to install up to 192GB of RAM!), Several PCI slots for video cards (as a rule, they install Quadro video cards from nVidia, prices for which are better not to watch) and all the relevant cases.  I don‚Äôt know how many in ‚Äúparrots‚Äù or ‚Äú3DMark-ah‚Äù, but in terms of performance such a ‚Äúmachine‚Äù is comparable with some supercomputers of the early 2000s. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a70/4bb/304/a704bb3045cf982d066edc3f9ae0ae28.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/253/38b/2dd/25338b2dd93e0cba8c6131dcf3ab3890.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  According to IDC for 4Q09, Intel provides about 90% of all world workstations and servers with its processors.  Tony Neil-Graves: ‚Äú <i>Workstations are specialized computers created for designers, creative people, financiers and the oil and gas industry ‚Äî for employees of any profession who are willing to invest in high performance because their work depends on it</i> .‚Äù  In the recent past, animators worked almost blindly, sending their work to the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2584%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0">server farms</a> , rendering the results and checking them with their ideas.  Katzenberg shares that even in the best case, only 70% of the processed material was used.  DreamWorks technical director Ed Leonard says that now animators using powerful workstations can visualize their work ‚Äî say, the movements of a dragon's tail during flight ‚Äî almost in real time.  ‚Äú <i>What was previously calculated per night is now considered almost in real time,</i> ‚Äù says Leonard. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c92/cff/ab8/c92cffab840f17a7c7dea9afe4e91a12.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  "How to Train Your Dragon" - a three-dimensional animated film;  The sensation of volume is especially vivid during the breathtaking scenes of flying on a dragon  The level of detail is also impressive: the detailed water, the individual hairs of the fur of the hides that the Vikings wear, and even ash particles flying in the air after the dragon fire - all this has been worked out with care and in 3D.  And if a few years ago DreamWorks released one film a year., Now, thanks to a new toolkit, the company will be able to release three films in the same period. <br><br>  And, something tells me, Cameron also creates his masterpieces not on a cluster of PS :) So, once again - ‚Äúwe live in an interesting time‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>* UPD *</b> : <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/blogs/2009/04/08/3d/">Interesting article</a> about 3D movies and Intel InTru3D. <br><br>  <b>Successes!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/89683/">https://habr.com/ru/post/89683/</a></p>
