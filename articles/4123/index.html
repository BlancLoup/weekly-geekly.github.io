  <section class="page js-page"><h1>There was no trouble, the woman went on the Internet *</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today, the average resident of a million-plus city is hardly surprised by the information that you can find a job, meet a young man, or buy a new refrigerator without getting out of your household sneakers and not getting up from your favorite stool.  And if you risk calling a woman a lamer based solely on gender, she will most likely just send you to hell.  By hyperlink, of course. <br><br>  Woman - she is generally quickly mastered everywhere.  If a man is constantly concerned about the creation of new toys for himself (to collect, disassemble, improve technical data), then the woman simply uses the resulting invention, without loading her head with unnecessary details about how this thing works.  Therefore, the process of communication of women with computer intelligence is much more fascinating.  Moreover, it is covered with a mystical haze.  For example, many women believe that there is a living soul in the office metal pile, which can be negotiated with the magic ‚Äúreset‚Äù button.  And, by the way, it often works. <br><br>  Women open their Internet resources: magazines, shops, forums, conquering an increasing mass share in the web.  According to estimates by the <a href="http://www.hitwise.com/">Hitwise</a> marketing company, in 2003 women accounted for 51.4% of Internet traffic in the United States.  In Russia, the figure at that time was slightly lower, but from year to year it only increases, and the Internet is rapidly refined with gigabytes of pictures for the desktop with kittens and flowers, cookbooks online, letters of happiness and others that are absolutely indispensable for a feeling of comfort. things.  Today, to please the pagan perception of the world through the prism of female psychology, it is already possible to bewitch any member of the opposite sex from the Internet or calculate your horoscope for life.  And this, apparently, is not yet the limit of the possible.

      However, do not think that women's communication with the web of reason is limited to these cute pranks.  If we talk about such things as studying the scientific literature on the Web, looking for work, dating, etc., then cyber-woman is not much different from cyber-man.  Social roles are becoming more conditional, and a woman has nothing to hide behind a male guise to enter the lobby of the forums a la "bab.net" and find out all your terrible secrets behind seven passwords, keep this in mind.  In addition, it is easier for a woman to handle search engines, since their logic often coincides. <br><br>  But when it comes to emotions, the difference is enormous.  While the man is having fun with stock prices on the stock exchange (playing online football, dabbling with a secret database, searching for porn), the woman is absorbed in far more serious things: she makes up for the lack of spiritual contacts, satisfying the vital need for communication.  Indeed, unlike men inclined to debate, she just needs to share painful ones.  For days at a time, office workers, to the delight of their superiors, knock on the keyboard at the speed of the machine-gun queue, discussing the weather, the roommate, the last movie watched, sales in the central stores of the city, and what else can be discussed.  Moreover, as a rule, this is reflected in labor productivity positively: it took off stress, podnazuzhilas - and passed five years on emotions at four years.  Are you weak? <br><br>  Family life with the advent of digital communication also got used to revolutionary changes: a couple of hours of conversation on the ‚Äúkapslok‚Äù during working hours, and the home scandal was exhausted (shouted, sort of like).  At the same time, the man had a unique opportunity to move away at the time of launching a virtual plate into a virtual wall for a smoke break, and then also catch the partner on the floor (the main thing is not to forget to include the message history in ICQ). <br><br>  But various blogs, and in particular <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/">Livejournal</a> , have become a truly golden bottom for outpouring of emotions.  This is where female psychology rules and commands!  By the way, the overwhelming majority of popular LJ-users are men, and this is the best evidence that the overwhelming number of readers are women, always ready to share the restrained male joy and dry up the mean male tear. <br><br>  In short, the modern hyper-woman is a full-fledged hostess on the Web, capable of doing anything with her.  In addition to conceiving and having a baby, perhaps.  But now the already concerned spouses have to drag their faithful away from the coveted screen with a bunch of windows in order to finally fulfill their marital duty and at least somehow justify their stay on Earth. <br><br>  * - Russian folk saying </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4123/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4123/</a></p>
