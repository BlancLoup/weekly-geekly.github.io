  <section class="page js-page"><h1>DevOps Fan Conference</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This is, of course, about <a href="https://devopsconf.io/moscow/2019/speakers">DevOpsConf</a> .  If you do not go into details, then on September 30 and October 1 we will hold a conference on combining the processes of development, testing and operation, and if you go in - I ask for cat. <br><br>  In the framework of the DevOps approach, all parts of the technological development of the project are intertwined, occur in parallel and influence each other.  Of particular importance here is the creation of automated development processes that can be changed, simulated and tested in real time.  It helps to instantly respond to changes in the market. <br><br>  At the conference, we want to show how this approach influences product development.  How to ensure the reliability and adaptability of the system for the client.  How DevOps changes the structure and approach of the company to the organization of the workflow.

Therefore, we invited to the Program Committee not just experts, but specialists who see the DevOps discourse from different perspectives: <br><br><ul><li>  senior engineers; </li><li>  developers; </li><li>  timlidov; </li><li>  CTO. </li></ul><br>  On the one hand, this creates difficulties and conflicts when discussing applications for reports.  If the engineer is interested in analyzing a major accident, then the developer is more important to understand how to create software that works in the clouds and infrastructures.  But by negotiating, we create a program that will be valuable and interesting to everyone: from engineers to CTO. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dk/nb/97/dknb972x1nz8iywgp0g0_4-mbnk.jpeg"><br><br>  The task of our conference is not just to choose more interesting reports, but to present the big picture: how does the DevOps approach work in practice, what kind of rake can you run into when moving to new processes.  At the same time, we build the content part, going down from a business task to specific technologies. <br><br>  The conference sections will remain the same as <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/oleg-bunin/blog/431544/">last time</a> . <br><br><ul><li>  Infrastructure platform. </li><li>  Infrastructure as a code. </li><li>  Continuous delivery. </li><li>  Feedback. </li><li>  Architecture in DevOps, DevOps for CTO. </li><li>  SRE practices. </li><li>  Learning and knowledge management. </li><li>  Security, DevSecOps. </li><li>  DevOps Transformation. </li></ul><br><h2>  Call for Papers: what reports are we looking for? </h2><br>  We divided the potential audience of the conference into five groups: engineers, developers, security specialists, team leaders and CTOs.  Each group has its own motivation to come to the conference.  And, if you look at DevOps from this perspective, you can understand how to focus your topic and where to place accents. <br><br>  <strong>For engineers who</strong> are engaged in the creation of an infrastructure platform, it is important to understand the existing trends, to understand which technologies are currently the most advanced.  They will be interested to get acquainted with the real experience of using these technologies and exchange views.  The engineer will be happy to hear the report with the analysis of some hardcore accident, we, in turn, will try to pick up such a report and polish it. <br><br>  <strong>For developers,</strong> it is important to understand such a thing as a <strong>cloud native application</strong> .  That is, how to develop software so that it works in the clouds and various infrastructures.  The developer needs to constantly receive feedback from the software.  Here we want to hear cases about how companies are building this process, how to monitor software performance and how the entire delivery process is organized. <br><br>  <strong>It</strong> is important for <strong>cybersecurity professionals to</strong> understand how to customize the security process so that it does not stop the development and change processes within the company.  Interesting will be the topic of the requirements that DevOps imposes on such specialists. <br><br>  <strong>Timlides want to know</strong> how the process of delivery in other companies is organized.  Which way did the company go to this, how did the development processes, quality assurance within DevOps lined up?  Cloud native teamlords are also interesting.  And yet - questions about the interaction within the team and between development teams and engineers. <br><br>  For <strong>CTO, the</strong> most important thing is to figure out how to combine all these processes and adjust them for business needs.  He makes sure that the application is reliable both for business and for the client.  And here you need to understand what technologies will work for what business tasks, how to build the whole process, etc.  CTO is also responsible for budgeting.  For example, he must understand how much money he needs to spend on retraining specialists so that they can work in DevOps. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/j4/yo/le/j4yolevv9ntjcax7femcwmrlo00.jpeg"><br><br>  If you have something to say on these occasions, do not be silent, <a href="http://conf.ontico.ru/lectures/propose">submit a report</a> .  The deadline for Call for Papers is August 20th.  The earlier you declare, the more time will be spent on finalizing the report and preparing for the presentation.  So do not over tighten. <br><br>  Well, if you don‚Äôt have the need to speak in public, just <a href="https://conf.ontico.ru/conference/join/dc2019-moscow.html">buy a ticket</a> and come to communicate with colleagues on September 30 and October 1.  We promise, it will be interesting and inspiring. <br><br><h2>  How do we see DevOps </h2><br>  To understand exactly what we are investing in the concept of DevOps, I recommend reading (or re-reading) my report ‚Äú <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/oleg-bunin/blog/448492/">What is DevOps</a> ‚Äù.  Walking through the waves of the market, I watched how the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãDevOps was transformed in companies of various sizes: from a small startup to transnational companies.  The report is built on a series of questions, answering them, you can understand whether your company is moving towards DevOps or there are problems somewhere. <br><br>  DevOps is a complex system, it should contain: <br><br><ul><li>  Digital product. </li><li>  Business modules that develop this digital product. </li><li>  Food commands that write code. </li><li>  Practice Continuous Delivery. </li><li>  Platforms as a service. </li><li>  Infrastructure as a service. </li><li>  Infrastructure as a code. </li><li>  Selected practices for maintaining reliability, wired inside DevOps. </li><li>  Practice feedback that describes it all. </li></ul><br>  At the end of the report there is a scheme that gives an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe DevOps system in the company.  It will allow you to see which processes in your company have already been debugged and which ones just have to be built. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xy/iv/bv/xyivbv7hgv-k9jxyc3vseuh8_mg.png"><br><br>  Video report can be viewed <a href="https://youtu.be/php6DfXXG0Y">here</a> . <br><br>  <strong>And now there will be a bonus:</strong> several videos from RHS ++ 2019, which deal with the most common issues of the DevOps transformation. <br><br><h3>  Company infrastructure as a product </h3><br>  Artyom Naumenko leads the DevOps team at Skyeng and takes care of the development of his company's infrastructure.  He told how infrastructure influences business processes in SkyEng: how to calculate ROI for it, which metrics to choose for calculation and how to work on improving them. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WjFccIaFQNc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h3>  On the way to microservices </h3><br>  Nixys company is engaged in support of loaded web-projects and distributed systems.  Its technical director, Boris Ershov, told how to transfer software products to modern rails, the development of which began about 5 years ago (or even more). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sm/xl/l6/smxll6xxdgbufochwqlsfb5xzsa.jpeg"><br><br>  As a rule, such projects are a special world, where there are such dark and ancient corners of the infrastructure that current engineers do not know about them.  And once selected approaches to architecture and design are outdated and cannot provide businesses with the same pace of development and release of new versions.  As a result, each release of the product turns into an incredible adventure, where something constantly falls off, and in the most unexpected place. <br><br>  Managers of such projects inevitably face the need to transform all technological processes.  In his report, Boris said: <br><br><ul><li>  how to choose the appropriate architecture for the project and put in order the infrastructure; </li><li>  what tools to use and what pitfalls are encountered on the way to transformation; </li><li>  what to do next. </li></ul><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nklIy2qbMi0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h3>  Release automation or how to deliver quickly and without pain </h3><br>  Aleksandr Korotkov is the leading developer of the CI / CD system at CIAN.  He spoke about automation tools that allowed improving the quality and reducing the time of delivery of the code in production by 5 times.  But such results would have been impossible to achieve with only one automation, therefore Alexander drew attention to changes in the development processes. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0wvUyjexoIg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h3>  How do accidents help learn? </h3><br>  Alexey Kirpichnikov has been implementing DevOps and infrastructure at SKB Kontur for 5 years.  For three years in his company there were about 1,000 fakaps of varying degrees of epicity.  Among them, for example, 36% were caused by rolling out a poor-quality release in production, and 14% were caused by maintenance work on iron in the data center. <br><br>  Obtaining such accurate information about accidents allows the archive of reports (post mortems), which the company's engineers have been conducting for several years in a row.  Postmortem writes the engineer on duty, who was the first to react to the alarm about the accident and began to repair everything.  Why torture engineers who are fighting at night with packs, writing reports?  This data allows you to see the whole picture and move the infrastructure development in the right direction. <br><br>  In his speech, Alexey shared how to write a really useful post-mortem and how to implement the practice of such reports in a large company.  If you love stories about how someone screwed up, watch the video of the speech. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tuSZq4rW8TQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <em>We understand that your vision for DevOps may not coincide with our ideas.</em>  <em>It will be interesting to know how you see the DevOps transformation.</em>  <em>Share in the comments your experience and vision of this topic.</em> <br><br><h2>  What reports have we already accepted into the program? </h2><br>  This week, the Program Committee adopted 4 reports: on security, infrastructure, and SRE practices. <br><br>  Perhaps the most painful topic of DevOps transformation is how to make sure that the guys from the information security department do not ruin the already established links between development, operation and administration.  <strong>Some companies do without the department of information security</strong> .  How, then, to ensure information security?  This <a href="https://devopsconf.io/moscow/2019/abstracts/5478">will tell</a> <strong>Mona Arkhipova from sudo.su.</strong>  From her report, we learn: <br><br><ul><li>  what and from whom it is necessary to protect; </li><li>  what are the routine safety processes; </li><li>  how IT and IS processes intersect; </li><li>  what is CIS CSC and how to implement it; </li><li>  how and by what indicators to conduct regular checks of information security. </li></ul><br>  The next report deals with the development of infrastructure as a code.  Reduce the amount of manual routine and not turn the whole project into chaos, is it possible?  <strong>Maxim Kostrikin from Ixtens</strong> <a href="https://devopsconf.io/moscow/2019/abstracts/5310">will answer</a> this question.  His company uses <strong>Terraform</strong> to work with the AWS infrastructure.  The tool is convenient, but the question is how to avoid using it a huge chunk of code.  Serving such a heritage each year will cost more and more. <br><br>  Maxim will show how code placement patterns work, aimed at simplifying automation and development. <br><br>  We'll hear another infrastructure <a href="https://devopsconf.io/moscow/2019/abstracts/5323">report</a> from <strong>Vladimir Ryabov from Playkey</strong> .  Here we will talk about the infrastructure platform, and we will learn: <br><br><ul><li>  How to understand if storage capacity is used efficiently; </li><li> how several hundred users can receive 10 TB content each, if only 20 TB storage is used; </li><li>  how to compress data 5 times and provide it to users in real-time; </li><li>  how on the fly synchronize data between several data centers; </li><li>  how to eliminate any user influence on each other when using one virtual machine sequentially. </li></ul><br>  The secret of this magic is in the <strong>ZFS</strong> technology <strong>for FreeBSD</strong> and its recent fork of <strong>ZFS on Linux</strong> .  Vladimir will share cases from Playkey. <br><br>  <strong>Matvey Kukui from Amixr.IO is</strong> ready to use examples from his life to <a href="https://devopsconf.io/moscow/2019/abstracts/5508">tell</a> you what <strong>SRE is</strong> and how it helps to build reliable systems.  Amixr.IO skips client incidents through its backend, dozens of on-duty teams around the world have already resolved 150,000 cases.  At the conference, Matvey will share the statistics and insights that his company has accumulated, solving customer problems and analyzing bundles. <br><br><blockquote>  Once again I urge you not to be greedy and share your experience with the DevOps Samurai.  <a href="https://conf.ontico.ru/lectures/propose/%3Fconference%3Ddc2019-moscow">Apply</a> for a report, and you and I will have 2.5 months to prepare an excellent presentation.  If you want to be a listener, <a href="http://eepurl.com/bN_0E1">subscribe</a> to the newsletter with the program updates and seriously think about booking tickets in advance, because they are more expensive to the dates of the conference. </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/458920/">https://habr.com/ru/post/458920/</a></p>
