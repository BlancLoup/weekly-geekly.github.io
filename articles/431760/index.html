The popularity of webinars is achieved through a combination of flexibility of interaction and convenience of advanced technologies: instant adaptation of information to the listener, personalization of reporting information using answers to questions after webinars, and more. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  At the most basic level, the webinar software includes video conferencing and audio conferencing.  Some also offer features such as screen sharing, video recording, file sharing, and integration with other software, such as Microsoft PowerPoint. </p><br><p>  Most of the webinar software is paid and many users come to traditional video conferencing software.  Video conferencing software and webinar software are often very similar, but differ in the number of participants and functionality.  However, many find the functionality they need for conducting webinars in free video conferencing software. </p><br><p>  <strong>What you need to consider when choosing a category:</strong> </p><br><ul><li>  Number of participants </li><li>  The duration of your event </li><li>  Desired features (Record, Branding, etc.) </li><li>  Need for scalability </li></ul><br><p>  The list that we give here includes solutions for webinars with free subscription options and does not include products that are available only during the trial period, etc. <br>  They can support only one user or one project, but they are really free.  However, scaling often requires full paid subscriptions. </p><br><p>  Here are seven of the best free webinar tools for real G2 Crowd user reviews in 2018. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ew/pr/p_/ewprp_tmap8v_wnsvztzthtely8.png"></p><br><h3 id="1-freeconferencecallcom">  1.

Although I understand that it is free, but there is not enough, for example, the ability to send files.  Sometimes listening can be annoying if there is someone who has poor service and needs to call back.  When you do this, it disconnects the rest of the call and reconnection can take a long time.  Delay sound can also be a problem. </blockquote><p>  Reviewed by Caitlin P. </p><br><h4 id="rekomendacii">  Recommendations </h4><br><blockquote>  It is an easy-to-use free program with many great features.

I like the various Zoom features.  Recently did a webinar, and it was great to use the function of a teacher.  I managed to scan the group to find out how many people participated.  I liked the opportunity for participants to ask questions and add comments.  I had no connection problems, which is great.  I also like how I can use it for personal online meetings.  And the ability to use it on my phone really helped on the go! </blockquote><p>  Reviewed by Jeremiah K. </p><br><h4 id="chto-polzovatelyam-ne-nravitsya-1">  What users don't like </h4><br><blockquote>  The functions of the webinar are sufficient to conduct a full-fledged webinar, including using surveys, markup tools, etc. At the same time, the platform still lacks integration with other tools, such as autoresponders (for example, ConvertKit, Active Campaign, etc.). d.) </blockquote><p>  Reviewed by Jorge C. </p><br><h4 id="rekomendacii-1">  Recommendations </h4><br><blockquote>  I looked at a lot of software to be sure that I was making the right choice.
