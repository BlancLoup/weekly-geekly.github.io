Its development has served as an example for other companies, at one time fans of Palm products were not considered.  Like many other brands, Palm still had to leave the market, for a number of reasons.  But the company's devices and its software are still popular with geeks. <br><br>  The company was bought by HP, in which it dissolved.  After absorption, HP released several devices based on a new software platform, but, unfortunately, new items did not become particularly popular.  After that, HP sold the rights to the Palm brand of the Chinese company TCL, this happened in 2014.  Since then, nothing has been heard about Palm ... until now. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  By the way, TCL is developing hardware for another almost disappeared brand - Blackberry, and it does it quite successfully.  RIM company deals only with software, including services focused on user security.

The appearance of the loss marked the announcement of a new device - a miniature smartphone Palm Palm.  It is placed in the palm of both male and female hands.  Disan gadget, however, is not too original and very much like a smartphone from Apple in miniature. <br><br>  The display of the device by today's standards is tiny - only 3.3 inches.  Dimensions of the device - 96.6mm * 50.6mm.  It is almost the size of a credit card, however, the smartphone is more ‚Äúthick‚Äù.  Palm is promoting its phone as an addition to the main device, which is not a new idea - previously similar gadgets have already been announced by various companies.  As planned, the gadget should always be at hand, possibly in a wallet, purse or pocket. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e6d/aef/735/e6daef7354bb4d94b3025e7b391ddfaa.jpg"><br><br>  Characteristics for such a crumb is quite personal: a screen resolution of 1280 * 720 pixels with 445 ppi, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 SoC processor (by the way, eight-core, Cortex A53).  Also available in 3 GB of RAM, plus a 800 mAh battery.  The main storage is capacious - as much as 32 GB.  There are rear and front cameras, with a resolution of 12 and 8 MP, respectively.  Protection against dust and water is present, the standard IP68.  There are also wireless communication modules WiFi and Bluetooth, GPS, LTE.  Connection to a charger or PC via USB-C. <br><br>  The phone is anodized aluminum.  Colors - silver and gold.  There is no fingerprint sensor, but there is a face recognition system that allows you to unlock the device without any problems. <br><br>  OS device - customized Android 8.1 Oreo.  On the main screen are the application icons, which resembles the Apple Watch screen. <br><br>  Unfortunately, the gadget is sold only by the operator Verizon (USA).  The cost of the crumbs is unexpectedly high - $ 349.9.  The phone will go on sale in November. <br><br>  It may be that miniature phones will become a trend, because after Palm a similar device was announced by the Japanese company Kyocera.  In principle, unusual devices for her are not at all new - she had previously delighted fans of her products with a number of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2011/02/kyoceras-dual-screen-android-smartphone-may-tax-cpu/">original solutions</a> . <br><br>  Its latest novelty is the KY-O1L smartphone, its dimensions make it possible to place the device in the purse section for credit cards.  It is worth noting that the device is unlike any other - its design is different from any modern gadgets, and the display is 2.8 inch ePaper, which is used in some e-book models. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4c1/e95/f44/4c1e95f4472957f74db78eb09a92c1fe.jpg"><br><br>  The device dimensions are 91 mm * 55 mm * 5.3 mm, weight - 47 grams.  The phone has its own software shell, additional applications, as far as can be understood, cannot be installed.  No, and many familiar to the camera.  But there is a browser, calculator and calendar.  Technically, this is a smartphone, but how convenient it is to work with it is a question.  The battery capacity is 380 mAh, which is enough for a miniature gadget with an ePaper-display. <br><br>  This device will also be sold by only one company - the Japanese operator NTT Docomo.  The price is slightly lower than that of the Palm Palm, but also not very low - $ 285.  Device developers believe that the phone does not have to be a universal tool - sometimes it's just calls with a couple of additional functions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/427179/">https://habr.com/ru/post/427179/</a></p>
