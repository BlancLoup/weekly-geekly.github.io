The forms of its manifestation are sometimes quite unexpected and can even confuse the seemingly experienced owner of mobile gadgets. <br><br>  In order not to fall for scammers, as a rule, banal care is enough, but no one is insured against unforeseen circumstances.  It may well happen that you gave the phone to play a child or see a friend, and returned it to you with a guilty expression and a puzzled phrase: ‚ÄúSomething surfaced there, I clicked to skip, but here it is ...‚Äù <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/329/047/aab/329047aab95a3b71be4f5be4b7d2c2e3.png"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The main source of phishing - in fact, innocent push-notifications that appear during the installation of certain applications.  Their presence only indicates that the developer has entered into a contract with the advertiser through a system based on the site Airpush.com.  By itself, it is legal and offers users products and services without bothering them with annoying banners and ad units, the presence of which often distinguishes free versions of games and applications.

    <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c89/66e/6cf/c8966e6cf8b6e0c2bb070f1734d879c9.jpg"></div><br>  The problem is that the ads themselves are sometimes not at all those who they say they are.  And here it is necessary to keep your ears open.  Already the talk of the town was the proposal to update the Opera Mini browser, and it is not necessary that you have it installed, the task is completely different.  To avoid emptying your account, you need to stock up on appropriate equipment.  We will try to tell about the main programs designed to recognize suspicious software.  And at the end of the article will be given brief recommendations on the next steps for those who have already suffered from the actions of mobile scammers. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/461/49e/c6e/46149ec6e3632864060ef78636ffa4f1.jpg"></div><br>  If on the screen of your phone began to appear pop-up advertisements of an advertising nature, to determine the cause of the "celebration" is enough to use one of the following applications available for free in the Android Market: <br><ul><li>  Addons detector </li><li>  Air push detector </li><li>  Airblock </li></ul><br>  If the last two utilities can only scan installed applications for those with unnecessary permissions and return the result as a list with a suggestion to remove the offending program, then the capabilities of Addons Detector are much wider.  At your disposal is a convenient filter by such criteria as the presence of built-in license verification tools, advertising modules, push notifications, as well as developer tools.  The results obtained can be exported or supplemented by the online application database.  To speed up the process, checking of system programs is disabled by default, but if suspicions are strong, you can uncheck the box. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c61/c69/858/c61c69858c88bf899b437ac30d1fd190.jpg"></div><br><br>  For example, in this case, it was possible to prevent the penetration of malware on your smartphone.  Remarkably, but what to do if the update of the same Opera Mini was due to an oversight or inattention turned out to be, and they have already seriously worked on the account balance? <br><br>  In this case, you need to call the subscriber service of your telecom operator and make an application in which the following information should be indicated: <br><ul><li>  Amount of funds debited from the account; </li><li>  Date and time as accurate as possible; </li><li>  The circumstances under which the write-off occurred (in this case, the installation of the application for Android OS); </li><li>  The exact address of the site from which the application was downloaded and installed (numerous redirects are not excluded, therefore the address may vary from case to case); </li><li>  Upon receipt of any SMS-messages - their text, the number of the sender and the time of receipt; </li><li>  Please reimburse the funds written off as a result of fraud. </li></ul><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e24/1d6/ece/e241d6ece3df99777e5ab69e05486584.jpg"></div><br>  If you spend your time on taking these actions, then with a high degree of probability, after carrying out an appropriate check, you will receive a refund.  As a rule, it takes several days to complete this operation.  It is also important that the corresponding signal will be given regarding the short number tied in the fraudulent scheme, and according to the order of the telecom operator, the number of the unclean content provider should be blocked. <br><br>  As a preventive measure, you can use a popular solution from the well-known company Doctor Web, a mobile antivirus that has both a paid and a free version.  Checking each installed application, it will give an alarm when it detects a Trojan program that sends paid SMS to short numbers.  In addition, you can run a full system scan for suspicious content.  This is especially true if, for one reason or another, you had to install software from sources that do not deserve special trust. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/835/ebd/899/835ebd89962d50b497bcc5219a6d51b5.jpg"></div><br>  The main rule - be careful, do not rush to click "OK" or "Continue" when installing programs.  Be alert should also be if the application is suspiciously small.  Having found sending SMS in the list of permissions, consider whether this function is really required taking into account the scope of the program. <br><br>  If, however, you have not saved yourself and others, do not worry, there is always a way out.  And the unprecedented amounts allocated by operators to combat mobile fraud, will rely not only on the return of lost funds, but also on the adoption of effective measures designed to once and for all end the dark deeds of unscrupulous businessmen from the mobile industry. <br><br>  The programs and utilities mentioned in the article: <br><br>  Free install Air Push Detector: <br>  <a href="https://market.android.com/details%3Fid%3Dcom.brosmike.airpushdetector">market.android.com/details?id=com.brosmike.airpushdetector</a> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/999/b06/3c6/999b063c69077917c80be6d22b9fbcc4.gif"></div><br><br>  Free install Addons Detector: <br>  <a href="https://market.android.com/details%3Fid%3Dcom.denper.addonsdetector">market.android.com/details?id=com.denper.addonsdetector</a> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4b4/244/464/4b4244464550f2f538d22da8fcbb5ad3.gif"></div><br><br>  Install AirBlock for free: <br>  <a href="https://market.android.com/details%3Fid%3Dcom.cunninglogic.airblock">market.android.com/details?id=com.cunninglogic.airblock</a> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/31d/7ba/2b4/31d7ba2b4b0dc70b26ddbcb5dac1ea63.gif"></div><br><br>  Free install antivirus Dr.  Web Light: <br>  <a href="https://market.android.com/details%3Fid%3Dcom.drweb">market.android.com/details?id=com.drweb</a> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/01d/122/2c6/01d1222c69616dddf991fb5d91948659.gif"></div><br><br>  Buy for $ 4.99 full version of antivirus Dr.  Web: <br>  <a href="https://market.android.com/details%3Fid%3Dcom.drweb.pro.market">market.android.com/details?id=com.drweb.pro.market</a> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1a7/952/d9c/1a7952d9c4561fd016bf479fe6bf23cf.gif"></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/138679/">https://habr.com/ru/post/138679/</a></p>
