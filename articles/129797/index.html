  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mailing Control Panel: postmaster.mail.ru</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today it is difficult to find an Internet project that would not communicate with its audience via e-mail.  On the other hand, Mail.Ru's monthly audience is almost 23 million people.  This means that among the recipients of your messages there will surely be many (even very many) addresses in the mail.ru, bk.ru, list.ru and inbox.ru domains.  Let's face it, with many popular projects, more than half of users have addresses on mail.ru. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/6e102fa1/a837db9c/2fba2bc9/aab2d36d.png" align="left"><br>  How can you know that your newsletters successfully reach these users?  How can you increase their effectiveness?  How can you track the statistics of complaints about your letters as spam?  Previously, the honest answer was: ‚Äúno way‚Äù.  But today Mail.Ru Mail is ready to proudly announce the emergence of a mailing control panel designed specifically for webmasters - <a href="http://postmaster.mail.ru/">postmaster.mail.ru</a> .  Attention, you see it first!  We have not yet published official press releases about this tool, because we want to share with the audience Habra and get your feedback. <br><br>  So what is a Postmaster? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This tool is convenient, intuitive and simple, like a boot (at least, we think so).  In order to start using it, you just need to add your domain to the project database and confirm the rights to it.  This can be done in several traditional ways - by creating a special file in the root of the web server, adding a meta tag to the header of the main page, or using a DNS check.  Of course, you can add as many domains as you use in your project. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Immediately after confirming the rights to the domain, the following useful statistics become available to you: <br><ul><li>  Total number of emails sent </li><li>  Number of complaints </li><li>  The number of successfully delivered messages </li><li>  Number of emails deleted as spam or flagged as possible spam </li><li>  The number of letters sent to non-existent addresses </li></ul><br>  All these figures you can observe in the dynamics of the daily, weekly and monthly periods. <br><br>  You probably know that the SMTP protocol makes it easy to fake the sender's address.  Therefore, to distinguish your mailing from spamming, we use DKIM-signature.  Hence the important note: in order for the statistics to work, your letters must be signed with the help of DKIM.  If your project still does not do this, set up your mail server right now (it's simple, many modern MTAs support DKIM out of the box).  By the way, this has a positive effect on the deliverability not only for mail.ru, but also for all mail systems and spam filters. <br><br>  In addition, at the postmaster we have collected a large amount of useful information for webmasters. <br><br>  First, the set of rules that mailings must comply with so that they are as likely to successfully fall into users' mailboxes.  There is nothing unusual or taken from the ceiling - all recommendations are based on common sense based on RFC standards, world best practices in this area.  Following our goals, we all need to remember that user comfort and convenience ultimately is the main thing. <br><br>  Secondly, detailed interpretations of the most common errors mentioned in the ‚Äúoff-hook‚Äù letters that you can receive from our mail servers have been published.  And most importantly - brief and effective recommendations for their consideration. <br><br>  Of course, postmaster.mail.ru does not cancel the address of abuse@corp.mail.ru, to which we still accept all questions related to the delivery of letters to mailboxes in our domains, carefully read and always respond.  But we sincerely hope that the appearance of this tool will make your life much easier, and the distribution will be more effective. <br><br>  Of course, this is only the beginning.  In the near future - a breakdown of statistics by type of letters (ie, the ability to monitor individual mailings) and support for FBL technology.  You can also get more detailed information about the effectiveness of mailings: the percentage of emails read, the percentage of deleted unread / read messages, the percentage of emails that entered the spam folder in the user's personal blacklist (personal antispam), and much more. <br><br>  Our goal is to make postmaster.mail.ru the most convenient for you.  So do not hesitate to leave your comments and suggestions in the comments.  All of them will be necessarily read, analyzed and as far as possible, taken into account. <br><br>  <em>Vasily Bespalov,</em> <em><br></em>  <em>Head Antispam Pochty@Mail.Ru</em> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/129797/">https://habr.com/ru/post/129797/</a></p>
