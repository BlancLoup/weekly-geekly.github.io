In this article, we have identified and grouped the most interesting applications. <br><br>  So, we proceed to the consideration of de-applications using ARKit. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote><h1>  Distance measurement </h1><br>  Applications that can measure the distance between various objects in real space will have an undeniable practical application. Probably, similar solutions will soon be in the telephone of the average user.  Measurement accuracy is remarkably high.  At the moment, we know of 2 such projects: </blockquote><br><h4>  1.

MeasureARKit </h4><br>  Another example of a project that allows to measure distances in augmented reality. <br><br>  <i>Links: <a href="https://github.com/DroidsOnRoids/MeasureARKit">github</a></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/92c/c46/2ea/92cc462eab254b34bdc18451d483e0c9.gif"><br><br><blockquote><h1>  Drawing in 3d space </h1><br>  ARKit technology allows for spatial marking using ‚Äúreference points‚Äù in real space.  This made it possible not only to create 3D-pictures, but also to make them static and stably attached to objects in the real world, for example, to place the picture on the horizontal plane of the table. </blockquote><br><h4>  3. ARKit-line-drawing </h4><br>  A project with a modified default ARKit, which allows you to draw a line in space by localizing the camera itself. <br><br>  <i>Links: <a href="https://github.com/lapfelix/ARKit-line-drawing">github</a></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/3bc/85e/6a1/3bc85e6a14c24a68ac3bb6ca3a904021.jpg"><br><br><h4>  4. ARBrush </h4><br>  This project demonstrates drawing in 3D.  The application uses Metal in combination with SceneKit. <br><br>  <i>Links: <a href="https://github.com/laanlabs/ARBrush">github</a></i> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bTHaEg-bnaU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h4>  5. ARPaint </h4><br>  Another original form of 3D drawing is a project that allows you to draw in real space with your own fingers.  The application uses the technology of tracking the movement of objects in space, thus determining the direction of movement of your fingers, on which it projects the image on the screen of the device. <br><br>  <i>Links: <a href="https://github.com/oabdelkarim/ARPaint">github</a> |</i>  <i><a href="https://www.toptal.com/swift/ios-arkit-tutorial-drawing-in-air-with-fingers">Tutorial</a></i> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gb9E0n8m5pE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><blockquote><h1>  Architecture and design </h1><br>  The technology opens up broad opportunities for the application of augmented reality in design and architecture.  For example, you can consider a 3D-model of the future house in a reduced form and get a more accurate picture of it.  You can also see the building in realistic dimensions as it will be after the completion of construction work.  All this can significantly facilitate the design and improvement of adjacent territories. </blockquote><br><h4>  6. IKEA Place </h4><br>  IKEA trading network has long been using the possibilities of augmented reality to promote their products.  The company has not bypassed the emergence of new functionality in ARKit, having developed a special application called IKEA Place.  Now objects have become even more stable and correspond to real sizes, they can be well looked at closely, having seen, for example, the device of the mechanism of a sofa-transformer.  In addition, there is a function of measuring distances. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Arbeh7vSIi8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h4>  7.

ARkit + Unity for Architecture </h4><br>  The application that allows you to get inside the virtual house in its realistic size. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nQeO1r9UIzQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h4>  9. ARkit architectural test </h4><br>  In this application, the future building can be displayed both in a realistic size and reduced in such a way that it fits on your desk. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ompkHJ3SmpE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h4>  10. Van Gogh's bedroom </h4><br>  A tour of the Van Gogh bedroom right on your table. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lvjVgt_ce5Q" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><blockquote><h1>  Equipment </h1><br>  Thanks to the technology that allows to determine flat horizontal surfaces in ARKit, stable stability is achieved when projecting large-scale models.  Thus, when the camera device approaches, the model does not disappear; even the smallest details of a large 3D model can be considered. </blockquote><br><h4>  11. Airplane </h4><br>  Now it is possible to look at 3D volumetric models close up, the model does not disappear, even if you approach the camera to the smallest details of the object. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nMd0dIAEJuc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h4>  12. Car Tesla </h4><br>  Just a couple of days ago, the application had an update, in which UI was introduced in the form of pedals and steering, in addition, there is a ‚Äúdesign studio‚Äù in which the user can slightly change the exterior of the 3D model.  Looks like it will be cool fun. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5KOTJT6A_V0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xCdjIDnCtps" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><blockquote><h1>  Maps and Navigation (+ 1 portal) </h1></blockquote><br><h4>  13. Use in Apple Maps </h4><br>  Using the capabilities of ARKit, the standard Map application allows you to navigate in the space of a 3D map (for example, in Sydney around the opera house), when the user moves physically with the device and moves the device itself in space.  For this feature, iOS 11 will have a special ‚Äúbird's-eye view‚Äù mode, which will be initially available only to a limited number of cities.  In addition, the Maps application will receive a guide function through the introduction of a 3D model in the form of a pointing arrow in augmented reality.  Also, the application will include VR mode. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xvMMxpvWgcw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h4>  14. ARKit CoreLocation </h4><br>  The application uses two technologies at once: ARKit itself, which works with camera data and motion sensors to display the surrounding world when it is moving, and CoreLocation, which uses Wi-Fi and GPS data to determine its location.  The ARKit + CoreLocation combination results in high AR accuracy.  Also in the augmented reality, arrows and inscriptions appear, indicating the route to a given location. <br><br>  <i>Links: <a href="https://github.com/ProjectDent/ARKit-CoreLocation">github</a></i> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Lo0Z7CkMWw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h4>  15. Friend Finder </h4><br>  Allows you to find a friend in crowded places, for example, in a crowd during a festival.  In augmented reality, index arrows are displayed. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YZH0n1wNUSU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h4>  16. Properly </h4><br>  When pointing the camera at real buildings, the application allows you to find out the cost of rental housing right on the screen of your device. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/228787115" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h4>  17. AR Shopping Waypoints </h4><br>  Navigator in the supermarket.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãshopping with the use of augmented reality in the supermarket is not new, but now it works much more stable with ARKit.  In addition, the developer introduced a good feature, combining the navigator with a shopping list. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GpvuSfOV7wo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  18.

In a fairly short time, many demos have already appeared in various game genres: from simple entertainment such as a snake or spinner to large-scale space battles.  ARKit makes the game in augmented reality more vivid and interesting. </blockquote><br><br><h4>  19. The Very Hungry Caterpillar </h4><br>  ‚ÄúVery Hungry Caterpillar‚Äù - a game based on the eponymous hand-drawn artwork by Eric Karl.  The player first grows his pet, carefully feeding him various foods in augmented reality.  Then you can observe how the pet twists its cocoon and turns into a fluttering butterfly, which flies up and joins dozens of other butterflies grown in previous games. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YfBfa9eTBzg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h4>  20. The Walking Dead: Our World </h4><br>  ‚ÄúThe Walking Dead‚Äù is a game based on a popular movie.  Before the player appears a pointer in the form of "traces of the dead", which leads him into space.  The game uses a new ARKit feature called ARPointCloud, which achieves the effect of a sudden appearance of zombies.  We note another important feature: the application has the possibility of a multiplayer game with the appropriate functionality, so you can fight with an aggressive army of zombies with your friend.  The announcement says that the game will also be released on Android, apparently using Google ARCore. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RPXUaMFpfXk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h4>  21.

Dance Reality </h4><br>  Dance practice in augmented reality.  The application is suitable for those who want to learn how to dance from scratch, it accompanies the dancer literally at his every dance ‚Äústep‚Äù.  Built a good dance voice.  In addition, there is the possibility of training in pairs.  It is possible that someone will quickly get tired of dancing with a smartphone in their hands, and a more optimal idea would be to transfer this tutor to iGlasses, but nevertheless using this application it is easy to master the basics of dance. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9Hega3Im4oU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h4>  39. Animated short films </h4><br>  This is worth mentioning as a separate point, as animated short films in AR can open a new era in the film industry, providing new storytelling opportunities.  Many film giants, in particular, the creators of ‚ÄúThe Lord of the Rings‚Äù have already become interested in technology.  The thing is that such a ‚Äúfilm‚Äù can be viewed from different sides of the stage by moving the device in space around the table, thus revealing new plot details.  The demo of such a short film was <a href="https://youtu.be/jAsxW5YtWrM">shown by</a> chance as an ARKit presentation at WWDC 2017. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NOdTyVvRMgY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h4>  40. Giphy World </h4><br>  As the name implies, we are talking about gif-animations.  Application developer is a well-known service for searching and editing gif-animations.  The application allows you to place 2D-animations and cartoon images and tie them to specific locations in real space.  As shown in the demo video, with the help of the application, the user can create, for example, instructions for the nanny using flying explanations in the form of animated images. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dEKTPn5AOEA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><blockquote>  While we were writing this article, there were still many new applications. <br>  We will be glad if in the comments you add those applications that are missing in our article. </blockquote><br>  Thank! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/336964/">https://habr.com/ru/post/336964/</a></p>
