We decided to dedicate this post to ‚Äúsmart‚Äù and useful devices for your favorite pets.  Of all those that are currently on the market, we chose the funniest ones and found it necessary to tell you about them. <br><br>  The list included iFetch, Petnet, Petcube, SureFlap and we, Mishiko, in person. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a9e/27e/2a6/a9e27e2a6be1f6eeb449dac9eb0d8b14.jpg"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>1. iFetch</b>

      This company has developed a smart mini-machine for throwing balls to dogs.  An excellent device, especially suitable for busy owners, who hardly have free time. <br><br>  It works like this: your dog puts the ball in the device's basket, followed by a warning signal, after which the ball crashes, and the dog happily runs after him. <br><br>  There are three models: <br><br>  <u>iFetch</u> - suitable for little four-legged buddies.  This model throws miniature balls (1.5 "). You can adjust the distance yourself - 3, 6 or 9 meters. <br><br>  <u>iFetch Too</u> is a larger starting machine designed for medium to large dogs.  In addition to the size of the balls (2.5 "), the launch distance also increases - you can set 3.7.12 and up meters, depending on the size of the pet. <br><br>  <u>iFetch Frenzy</u> is the third model, it differs from the previous two in that it has three grooves at the base, from which balls (1.6 ") can randomly fly out. This develops the pet's reaction and attentiveness. electronic), so there will be no problems with charging the device. <br><br>  In general, useful things, especially for playful and nimble pets. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LDTsDxhmNVY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>2. Petnet</b> is a company that came up with ‚Äúsmart‚Äù pet bowls (SmartFeeder and SmartBowl).  Using the mobile application, the owner can feed the pet on time if it is far from home.  Also, he can decide for himself how much the portion of the bowl should give to the pet. <br><br>  The application measures the amount of food that your animal needs, depending on weight, age and activity.  It works on both iOS and Android.  Looks like a ‚Äúmiracle bowl‚Äù like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f10/1a9/d32/f101a9d3258ab69a639004ba8513113a.jpg"><br><br>  <b>3. Petcube</b> <br><br>  The device, which was invented by Ukrainian entrepreneurs and pet lovers.  It is like a lifeline for the owner, who very rarely happens next to his little friend.  The company produces several models, each with its own purpose. <br><br>  <u>Petcube Play</u> is an interactive camera that allows you to monitor your pet for 24 hours, talk with it, and play.  It is small, 3x3x3, with a built-in speaker, a webcam, a laser pointer, a microphone and a Wi-Fi module. <br><br>  Using the mobile application, you can contact the device, talk to your pet, play with it, and also just see what it does.  The camera also has a night vision mode (in low light and its absence). <br><br>  <u>Petcube Bites</u> is a device that will temporarily replace the hand with a snack, that is, a caring owner can give a treat to his pet using a mobile application at any time.  And it is not necessary to be close to home. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C8QUbFsndBM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  You can record your pet on camera and monitor its every movement 24/7 using the <u>Petcube Care</u> mobile app.  All videos are encrypted and secure in the cloud.  Now the secrets of pets can be revealed :) <br><br>  <b>4. SureFlap</b> <br>  All developed devices of the company are very practical and useful.  But we want to tell you specifically about <u>Sureflap microchip cat flap</u> .  This is a smart cat valve, it is suitable only for cats that live in homes.  What is its advantage over conventional valves? <br>  This device will allow your pet to go for a walk whenever they want, and at the same time protect your home from other animals.  The valve will open only if it "recognizes" your cat.  For this purpose, a special chip is used, which is either implanted into a cat or mounted on its collar.  Also, the device can store in memory more than 32 identities. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jjOqzXCwDec" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>5. Mishiko</b> <br><br>  Well, for dessert, we left for you our GPS and fitness tracker for dogs Mishiko.  In previous posts, we compared different companies of dog collars, and we wrote a lot about the advantages of the Mishiko collar. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/18c/201/0ad/18c2010adcf84db654c9992aa507e57b.jpg"><br><br>  There are GPS trackers for dogs in the market - Whistle, Kippy and others - but they are not represented in Russia, and it will not be easy to use them because they are poorly localized to work in our cellular networks. <br><br>  Mishiko will help you keep track of your pet, and if he wants to run a lot, you can track his movement on the map of the app using the <u>Mishiko app</u> mobile app. <br><br>  In addition, in this device there are functions that will help you monitor the weight and health of the pet.  Mishiko will not allow this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b22/c16/937/b22c1693767a9aa117d40050f7659dde.jpg"><br><br>  At the heart of Mishiko - a special formula that calculates the activity rate for dogs of more than 600 breeds, taking into account the sex, weight and age of the pet.  It also has very cool daily statistics that show how much distance you have traveled with your dog today. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AJuHqi_yWvA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  More and more cool devices and smart devices for the comfort and health of your favorite animals appear on the market.  If you know / used any new items that we didn‚Äôt talk about, write your impressions in the comments.  We are happy to get to know them! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/403493/">https://habr.com/ru/post/403493/</a></p>
