Hayter request to avoid, otherwise I just chew swallowing without chewing. <br><br>  In general, the situation was as follows.  I have a website, my hobby is kinogid.com <br>  It is now entered in the registry, but it is available at <a href="https://w1.kinogid.com/">w1.kinogid.com</a> <br>  I have been developing projects for more than 10 years, I am not a professional in any field, but I have picked up some knowledge at the top and I try to hone my skills where it is the most difficult to do - that's exactly what I chose the subject of cinema!  The project is complex, the project is gray, but the project is honest! <br><br>  As you have already guessed, I have a website based on films, the site has entered the registry, while I will not hide this is not the first hit of the site in the registry.  Earlier, the site was blocked by the Moscow City Court as I missed letters from Roskomnadzor with requests to remove this or that content, the situation was always resolved and resolved democratically.  I will not hide, it caused pride in the country.  I was truly amazed by the activity of the RKN in the field of assistance to owners of sites like mine.  At some point, it even seemed to me that democracy as such exists, but it was not there.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Yes, the site is gray, but the site is original, but the democracy here is that there is no socialism here, let's not write about bad / good, but consider the situation differently. <br>  There is democracy, there is a set of laws, these laws do not prohibit the placement of films in open access, taken from open sources.  Every second contact user has one or another film in his collection of videos - this makes him automatically a distributor, alas, this is a sore and for the time being it is incurable.  In any case, I am against piracy, I will tell you more, I personally buy films, or rather I rent them in itunes.  I proudly advertise with my friends how awesome the music application I have on my phone is only 150 rubles, and what do you think, everyone around me considers me an idiot, claiming that why the hell I paid if it is free.  No one understands that I pay for the high-quality limitless music collection of all the performers in the world to which I get full access, isn't it worth 150 rubles?  Of course it is, but I do not exaggerate, I am really reproached for this, arguing that only an idiot could do this.  The mentality is indestructible, for this reason, all haters who want to call me a pirate, I immediately propose not to waste time. <br><br>  Now more to the point.  In our country there are a number of departments that are interconnected, but they all go under the Ministry of Communications.  For example, there is a department of the RKN - which is the executive power, they do not make any decisions, they only serve as a punisher, but I have no complaints about them - this is the usual six, which is in any mechanism. <br><br>  For many years, the RKN sent me letters warning the impending blocking of the content, the authorship of which received a claim.  Naturally, I, as a law-abiding citizen, could not help but respond to a direct court decision - I promptly deleted the content and for three years the RKN sent notifications to my personal mail, which they could not find through the website - oh, they really helped me, demonstrating the true face of democracy I was even slightly surprised.  But in order to keep the law - no questions. <br><br>  But recently my website was added to the registry for a life block.  Moreover, this time the decisions were not taken by the court, as is customary at any time, but by the Ministry of Communications.  Moreover, the decision was undeniable - my site was recognized as a mirror of the hdkinogid.net site which allegedly violated the law and did not fulfill the legal requirements, for which it was placed on the registry for a long time for life, and my site kinogid.com with the wording clone went there. <br>  When I appealed to the RKN with a request to clarify the situation, the answer came to me short and clear - according to this form of blocking, the decision is not considered, not appealed and not accompanied - the decision is made by the Ministry of Communication and Information Development.  Any questions please write to them.  Naturally, I left the appeal on the website of the Ministry of Communications, but as it turned out by phone, I need to wait for an answer within 30 days. <br><br>  As a result, my site is not just mistakenly entered in the registry, so the answer is also not planned in the near future.  Not only did the Ministry of Information Development make a mistake and could not distinguish my site from shit (forgive me the owner of hdkinogid.net) I don‚Äôt have a personal dislike, just really hdkinogid.net is just disgustingly disgusting when compared to my project.  Again, my personal opinion is not punitive, which cannot be said about the Ministry of Communications. <br><br>  It turns out people who are almost on the highest frontier, controlling in the direct and figurative sense high technologies are so stupid and illiterate.  But I do not care much about it.  I am worried about the personal situation in which I got into because of these free-thinkers who allowed themselves to be lynched. <br><br>  I would say that I am outraged, but this wording will not be accurate, I am truly offended, offended by the fact that they allowed themselves to compare my authoring work with some govosayt, so they also having the function of molesh did not try to figure it out and just killed my the project is taking his life.  And these people fight and protect copyright.  That is, they are not embarrassed that they generally allowed themselves to insult my authorship.  I was stunned when I saw with what site they decided to mix me with the Ministry of Communications.  That is, they are not confused by the wording, my website is a copy of hdkinogid.net - that is, they are my author's work, my work of art was considered a copy of some kind of poop, and these are top ranks in IT space - say I live in the land of fools, and the House of Ministers literally the wards of a madhouse ?! <br>  That is, in fact, all that makes the department of the RKN is absolutely meaningless.  They only pretend that there is some sort of pseudo-democracy, but at a certain point when they get tired of it they ask the ministry to take a fatal turn, just to reinforce an unreasonably good site to any forbidden and voila, forgiving democracy, hello dictatorship. <br><br>  That is, according to one silly man from the Ministry of Communications, the whole project erroneously loses its life.  Moreover, nobody specifically accompanies this decision and does not render assistance.  If earlier in the RKN they helped me, referring to certain legal norms, which they kindly observed, for which I reciprocated, but now they have written to me directly that this is a trap.  There is no ruling, there is no court, and there is no person in charge, and the Ministry of Communications and Mass Communications informed that applications are considered up to a month.  That is, they were not embarrassed that I shouted into the phone that they had killed the project by mistake, and they should have thought about it, but they said so, we don‚Äôt care, but do not care about my project, but generally don‚Äôt care at all. <br><br>  In fact, it turns out that a whole department of the RKN for which multimillion-dollar budgets are spent, led by the Ministry of Communications, for which multi-billion budgets are spent, decided to simply wipe out the tax money in the dust. <br>  It turns out there are not any notifications, there is not any democracy, there is a supreme body that is authorized to administer lynching on the basis of its subjective point of view, absolutely not supported by anything. <br><br>  In my place could be any site, any project in general as a whole.  That is, our state is not just not democratic, to hell with democracy, it is not a question of it that they have not even taken care that their mistakes are fatal.  Formally, the body endowed with such power is simply obliged to be in bilateral communication.  God bless him with my website, now the haters will fly in, they will thoughtlessly write about piracy without realizing that the main pirate is Yandex, they did not even hesitate to start delivering content immediately on movies in the style of an online movie theater, I was fucked at all how in the communications ministry could shoot a pug an elephant without noticing.  Double standards are our everything! <br><br>  In any case, the situation is simply paradoxical, the whole department of the RKN is simply devalued by one example, the whole ministry just surprised - they really thought that kinogid.com and hdkinogid.net are somehow side related sites. <br><br>  And now I ask people who can think in abstract terms to put together all the components of this chaos and draw the very parallels that have completely crossed themselves.  Agree, if there is an office of the RKN, which is mainly created for the settlement of issues, gets into a stalemate, it turns out it is not even a shah, it is not even a checkmate - this is really a stalemate.  In fact, the department is only a phenomenon, a phenomenon that requires large energy resources.  A huge number of educated people, and judging by their ability to conduct dialogues, they seemed to me to be educated, they are busy with just banal air shaking.  That is, these people do not even understand that they are not just sixes, but sixes of a rotten apparatus, headed by a tyrant, allowing themselves, under the slogan of copyright protection, to allow such gross errors, insulting someone else's authorship - this is a vicious circle of madness, but the most important whole department of the RKN in this circle does not even suspect that they are simply busy with nothing.  Many of them consider themselves to be useful social elements that are rapidly trying to contribute to their work, but they do not even realize that they are just a phenomenon, they simply do not exist - this is a paradox.  And what to say about multimillion budgets for the maintenance of this phenomenon is no longer a paradox, let it be called in the Ministry of Communications as they want this financial illiteracy.  Moreover, given the competence of this body, they still will not understand what they mean.  They could not distinguish kinogid.com from hdkinogid.net)) <br><br>  In any case, it‚Äôs a pity for the people from the RKN, it‚Äôs true that they are part of some kind of structure, but there‚Äôs no structure as such, because the arbitrariness, and most importantly the illiterate, does not even allow to get out of this vicious circle, absolutely innocent people which simply turn to dust, and in fact the agency plays a pseudo-democracy.  To some extent, the PKN is also to blame, they are well aware that at the other end a free-thinker is sitting, as it turned out absolutely to IT who has no relation, and they are not embarrassed to send notices to the site owners every morning, knowing full well that they don‚Äôt even see , and they themselves are just dust.  Well, they are not able to abstract, I am afraid even to imagine what a person will feel, suddenly realizing that he is dust! <br><br>  Undoubtedly, I have a little prejudice against the RKN, I was upset by the way they slyly decided to play the circus.  I am sure that this tyranny was initiated by them.  Well then ... <br>  If someone tries to make a clown out of you - make yourself a joker! <br>  In the Ministry of Communications, it is worth considering if anyone has the power to make punitive decisions by eye, you at least exclude the cross-eyed.  Today I am, and tomorrow, because of your strabismus, bury whatever national wealth.  I was generally outraged that the department has such a punitive power and allows itself the consideration of applications up to 30 days - is it really that all the decisions of the department are so flawless that any tragedies are excluded, and I repeat that punitive case.  You can not give a cross-eyed ax in your hands. <br>  As a result, the ILV is splurging, and at the other end of the corridor it is generally cross-eyed from the shoulder. <br><br>  If it seems to someone that there are signs of insult or disrespect of the authorities, I will ask you to open my website kinogid.com and the second website hdkinogid.net - if you think that the person who recognized these sites as copies is not a cross-eyed deer, then he is just a deer .  Although I think even a deer would see the difference, therefore, Greenpeace is more likely to have more complaints here, because I underestimated the deer))) - but then excuse me, wedge them out with a wedge.  They easily and naturally, allowed my site to compare with some govnosayt, even when I asked to quickly sort out - they said 30 days.  Well, I hardly believe that strabismus is treated at all, especially deer, but in any case, they have caused irreparable damage to my project, I am silent about the multimillion taxpayer budgets, for which dust is bought! <br><br>  PS Naturally, I‚Äôm not connected with the hdkinogid.net site - it‚Äôs not my project, and I don‚Äôt intersect it either.  And in the RKN they knew it perfectly, and in the Ministry of Communications too.  But if the ILV is dust, then the second in the hands of an ax.  To correct the situation hot on the heels they refused both there and there, for this purpose the purpose of this article to get rid of at least dust.  I hope that the RKN will read this article and understand that they do not exist as an entity, and the tyrant from the Ministry of Communications, who simply devalued them, is to blame for everything.  The ministry somehow should still be like that, but why does Roskomnadzor need to regulate all sorts of sharp topics around gray sites, but in fact, in the end, everything depends on the monkey with a grenade.  Although I think a monkey would distinguish sites.  Well, personally, I did everything so that kinogid.com was difficult to confuse with someone, although I don‚Äôt hide a couple of similar satellites, but they also fulfill all the requirements of the RKN as well as Cinema Guide, but they have not yet come to see the samurai of the cross-eyed.  In any case, I swear I have nothing to do with the hdkinogid.net website.  Anyway, I'm a perfectionist in everything.  I firmly believe how you call a ship, so it will sail.  I would never have called my project hdkinogid - well, if only it is not a submarine)) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/457968/">https://habr.com/ru/post/457968/</a></p>
