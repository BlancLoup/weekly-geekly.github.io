      <i><b>What is the purpose of your company's participation in Java conferences?</b></i> <br><br>  We want to share the practice of choosing technologies collected by the ‚Äúrake‚Äù, remote project management.  Also, we want to find leading JAVA specialists for the formation of teams that will develop powerful software. <br><br>  <i><b>Why did you choose Joker 2016 for this purpose?</b></i> <br><br>  To become a promising candidate for a job, you need a good basic education and relevant experience.  In addition, you should be aware of the latest technology.  St. Petersburg has all the components that make it possible to form a promising candidate: good Universities, leading IT companies and developer communities. <br><br><hr><br><br> <a href="https://gr.linkedin.com/in/ppapapetrou"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/854/be5/e04/854be5e04997471ba8e6ef675879f992.jpg" align="left"></a> <h2>  Patroklos Papaetra </h2><br>  Founder of SoftConf, Speaker, Software Gardener, Clean Code Evangelist <br>  Book author <br><br>  <i><b>What do you think about the evolution of Java technology and its future?</b></i> <br><br>  It seems to me that after the release of Java 8, which includes a large number of long-awaited functions, individual developers and software development companies again began to trust Java as the main programming language.  The upcoming Java 9 will include another popular feature - modularity.  It is good if this allows developers to easily create high-quality modular (i.e. microservice-based architecture) applications.  Time will tell. <br><br>  <i><b>Can Java be replaced with another programming language / technology?</b></i> <br><br>  This is a rather complicated question, but I would say no.  There are many programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãand some of them, to be honest, have features that are not in Java.  Thus, in theory - yes, Java can be replaced by other languages ‚Äã‚Äãor combinations of technologies.  But the question arises: ‚ÄúIs there a reason for replacing Java?‚Äù.  This is what I recommend: there is nothing that you cannot do with Java, if you are familiar with it, stick to its canons and improve the code.  Java is now relevant and will be relevant for many more years. <br><br>  <i><b>Why do you use Java in your projects?</b></i> <br><br>  We needed a stable environment for building enterprise applications with a fast development cycle.  Therefore, we chose Java 8 and Spring to implement the backend API.  This allows us to use all the interesting features of Java 8, as well as the power of Spring (security, AOP, API implementation, etc.). <br><br><hr><br><br> <a href="https://ua.linkedin.com/in/dmitry-ionash-28742552"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dc5/432/a5d/dc5432a5d54448cbb8e9d4475f4a4885.jpg" align="right"></a> <h2>  Dmitry Ionash </h2><br>  Senior Java Architect at <a href="http://crossover.com/"><b>Crossover</b></a> <br><br>  <b><i>What role does Java play in your business?</i></b> <br><br>  Programming today is an integral part of automation in any branch of science, life, life, sports, medicine ... anything.  The computer has entered all spheres of human activity, and the ecosystem as a whole. <br><br>  A programming language provides the ability to interact with a computer.  There are a great many of them, classified by a large number of criteria, from primitive to high-level.  Java is probably one of the most advanced, popular, understandable and convenient languages. <br><br>  The beauty of this language in its universality.  Taking the best of C and Pascal languages, it allows you to create working code regardless of the platform on which it should run - from servers to refrigerators and washing machines.  Therefore, it is difficult to overestimate his role in the business.  Working in IT, one can never be sure that the conditions of a business or the requirements of future customers will not change.  But this tool in the face of Java always allows you to keep up with technology and be fully armed with any changes in conditions or market laws. <br><br>  <i><b>Is it possible to replace Java in this role?</b></i> <br><br>  If in each case the problem is considered with certain conditions, then, of course, you can always find a substitute for any language.  However, as the task expands, the number of conditions and requirements set for the final product increases, the list of languages ‚Äã‚Äãsuitable for its solution is reduced.  Java is such a perfect and universal language that by tightening the requirements and increasing the number of conditions set before the language, sooner or later it will remain on the list alone.  Therefore, considering the present era in the context of computer technology, we can definitely answer that today there is no such perfect and universal programming language as Java, which can satisfy all the demands of the market and technology. <br><br>  <i><b>Are all your projects based on Java?</b></i> <br><br>  The universality and "omnivorous" of the language laid down and its weakness.  If we try to destruct the sphere of application of a given language, then for each individual case we can find a faster, more compact, more convenient language or even a separate technology.  Therefore, it would be completely wrong in terms of performance or other criteria for assessing the performance of the final product to use this tool always and everywhere.  That is why many, even very obsolete languages, do not die with time.  The choice of language should be based on pragmatism, because it is dictated by the laws of business;  hence the need to select specific languages ‚Äã‚Äãand technologies for specific tasks (for example, graphics require a language that processes huge amounts of information as quickly as possible, and fast and safe from the point of view of blocking language is needed to work with multithreading).  However, another advantage of Java is the flexibility of switching with other technologies, which makes it even more attractive. <br><br>  <i><b>Traditionally, companies expect to receive knowledge or people from such events.</b></i>  <i><b>Do you focus on personnel, which can potentially be found among visitors and speakers, or on the technology itself?</b></i> <br><br>  Of course, on the experts.  Perhaps our main advantage is the possibility of collecting any number of teams of any size, including already trained, high-level specialists, in an extremely short time.  Due to this, phenomenal flexibility in work is achieved, when the customer completely ceases to care about the selection of specialists, their professional qualities and the timing of the task.  Often this becomes a daunting task for many projects and companies, resulting in a threat to the entire project.  The second trump card that our company provides is a ready-made and remarkably efficient structure of the entire project creation chain - from setting the task to final testing and debugging, that is, the company provides a ready-made production pipeline that always works and which you can connect with any project at any time. . <br><br>  <i><b>How is Java used in your company?</b></i>  <i><b>What interesting projects are being developed at the moment?</b></i> <br><br>  For our company, Java is the main foundation connecting any project.  Modularity, prevalence, accessibility, convenience, versatility, and Java performance allow you to create a framework that is then populated with the Java code itself or bridges provided by the language, which allow you to encapsulate other, more specific languages ‚Äã‚Äãand technologies into an already existing framework.  It is convenient, it is universal and it is quite debugged both by the specialists of our company and the industry as a whole.  The colossal set of tools created to date allows us to solve a virtually unlimited set of tasks, and, considering any particular site from which the project is formed, we are faced with a huge choice, which gives us both the commercial segment and the free software sector. <br><br><hr><br> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mirceastrugaru"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d10/da7/3a7/d10da73a7e1c4421b20eb6dddeab6e72.jpg" align="left"></a> <h2>  Mircea Strugaru </h2><br>  VP Engineering at <b><a href="http://crossover.com/">Crossover</a></b> <br><br>  <i><b>How is Java used in your company?</b></i> <br><br>  First of all, the backend of our main portal is created in Java.  It is used to hire employees and evaluate performance indicators.  And the aLine tool (Assembly line, <a href="http://www.devfactory.com/the-devfactory-offering.php">www.devfactory.com/the-devfactory-offering.php</a> ) improves the manageability of software development projects;  helps to adhere to strict targeting and conduct the necessary measurements.  And this is extremely important in the KPI-based management approach (metrics). <br><br>  <i><b>How exactly do you choose technology for new projects?</b></i> <br><br>  This is part of the responsibilities of the chief software architect. <br><br>  <i><b>Give an example of the last successful project using Java?</b></i> <br><br>  Ride Austin, a service similar to the Uber application, providing 50,000 orders a week.  The entire backend is written in Java with clients running Android and iOS. <br><br><hr><br>  Summing up, we consider Java to be the fastest-growing enterprise-level technology stack and the demand for specialists will continue to grow rapidly in the coming years.  This is one of the sources of our customers' demand for hundreds of senior Java specialists, which lies behind the $ 8,000 / month sign.  vacancies Chief Architect <a href="http://ca.crossover.com/">ca.crossover.com</a> .
