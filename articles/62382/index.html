Dell 2209WA</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A brief history outlining the purchase of a monitor abroad on an IPS matrix - Dell 2209WA.  Including a small overview of the monitor itself.  The topic was written in order to attract attention to this monitor, as in my opinion it is good. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  1. Monitor selection </h3><br><br>  This story began in October 2008, when I began to think about changing my good old pipe monitor NEC 1350X, because my eyes began to tire wildly, and he wasn‚Äôt too young - the year 2000 was affected, and he began to slowly die .  I didn‚Äôt have a lot of experience using LCD monitors, but I wasn‚Äôt happy with the shopping trips and the experience of using ordinary office monitors and especially a laptop.  He began to understand, then he climbed to look at prices, was upset, went to work) Earned, but strangled the toad, so he began to consider less budget options: <br><br>  1. Apple Cinema Display 20 <br>  2. NEC Multisync LCD2170NX <br>  3. NEC 2070NX <br>  4. Dell 2007WFP

      But for some reason they all merged, it is impossible to find, then I don‚Äôt like the brand, it‚Äôs just that the soul doesn‚Äôt lie and I scored on this topic for a while.  The money went somewhere.  In early April, I accidentally came across the news that Dell is releasing a monitor on an e-IPS matrix at a ridiculous price.  This monitor is a <strong>Dell 2209WA</strong> .  The news was dated by January and I thought that they were already on sale in Moscow, I understood how cruelly wrong I was (I haven‚Äôt had whites until now). <br><br><h3>  2. Choosing a place to buy.  Germany. </h3><br>  He began to think what to do with it and found a way out - abroad.  There is no experience of shopping abroad, there is no normal card, but I really want to.  After studying ebay.com and ebay.de, I found options from America - $ 280, from Europe, too, 280, but euros.  It seems that the choice is obvious, but the delivery ... The monitor weighs 9.85kg, on delivery across the ocean it would have cost me another + $ 100, and the flight, the turbulence there, the air holes, and the thing is fragile, I decided not to risk it.  I chose the option from German ebay, registered, wrote to the seller by mail that I would like to buy a monitor from him, it was April 25th.  We corresponded with him for 4 days, from which I learned the following: <br><br>  1. Yes, he sends to Russia <br>  2. Price includes delivery <br>  3. He understates the cost so that I don‚Äôt have to go to customs and pay the tax (it‚Äôs not quite legally possible) <br>  4. Payment is possible either via PayPal or bank transfer. <br>  5. He is ready to check it for the presence of dead pixels and general performance. <br>  6. He has a Russian wife)) <br><br>  I chose a bank transfer, so I didn‚Äôt have a normal card that PayPal would accept (Visa Classic, Visa Virtuon, MasterCard Standard, MasterCard Virtual - Visa Electron is not suitable in most cases). <br><br><h4>  A warning: </h4><br>  Never choose a bank transfer payment if you are not 101% sure of the seller or do not want to tickle your nerves.  In the case of an unfair seller, you will not get your money back in 99% of cases.  He calmly can simply not send the goods, send the wrong thing, send the broken goods, whatever.  But I did not know about it) <br><br>  He sent me a PDF file with an invoice in German (Rechnung) in electronic form, I began to choose a bank, but on the phone, no bank could tell me anything worthwhile, most likely due to the fact that I did not ask, there were also features enough.  As a result, I drove into the first bank I came across, explained the situation and they began to study the printed invoice, ask again something, in the end I paralyzed the work of the bank for an hour, they didn‚Äôt have many customers.  The percentage was 25 euro, <strong>as a result I paid 305 euro for everything</strong> .  In the invoice, which came with the monitor, the amount was 180 euro - I specifically asked the seller to understate the cost so as not to have to go to customs. <br><br>  As a result, the monitor came to the post office in Austria <strong>on April 29</strong> - not a good time for postal parcels, due to impending holidays.

The track numbers are assigned to the majority of parcels (but there are exceptions), you can track the parcel by the number on the mailing site where the parcel is located in (as you can see, the Austrian post "lost" the parcel after importing to Russia, and the Russian "did not see" it before the arrival ) from this it follows that you need to write your home address either in transliteration or even in Russian, you do not need any street or avenue there, in Austria they only look at the receiving country.  After sending their country, the parcel is assigned an international "index" in my case it was CG100095350AT (the last letters indicate the country of departure), at this stage we can not influence the package in any way.  There are a few additional points that you can dwell on a bunch of articles, I will say briefly: <br><br><h5>  1. The choice of mail </h5><br><h5>  2. Receiving a parcel </h5><br><h5>  3. Customs </h5><br><br><h3>  Features of buying abroad, which I encountered </h3><br><h4>  1. Mail </h4><br><br>  Private or public? <br><br>  State in my opinion is preferable, because of its price in the first place, as well as due to the fact that the maximum cost of a parcel not subject to customs duties is 10,000 rubles, and if it is only 5000 rubles for private carriers.  The Russian state post is Russian Post and EMS.  EMS is good because the parcels are delivered to the house, as well as the fact that upon arrival in Russia, the parcels go to a separate terminal.  In my case, the parcel went by regular mail and it got into the PCI-3 terminal, there is also PCI-1, where small parcels are processed and usually they go faster.  I had to go to the post office and stand in line for about an hour.  FedEX, UPS, DHL belong to private ones. I cannot say anything good about them, it also works in terms of time, but at a price that is completely different, and if you run into customs, I don‚Äôt envy you. <br><br><h4>  2. Receiving a parcel </h4><br><br>  The process is not as simple as it seems, do not sign anything until you inspect the packaging, if it is damaged (the goods are broken), or broken (stolen), you can not sign anything and leave quietly, the parcel will go back, and if you paid through PayPal a chance to get money back, if everything is fine at first glance we sign and receive, if all the same a jamb came out, call the mail worker and draw up an act.  But you have rights, if something went wrong (broken, stolen, etc.) is not enough, so it is better to cross your fingers for 2 weeks and wait calmly. <br><br><h4>  3. Customs </h4><br><br>  I did not get under customs, despite the fact that the cost of the parcel exceeded 10,000 rubles, but there were no special problems with it (I was just too lazy to go there).  In the usual case, it turns out that if the goods cost more than 10,000 rubles, then we pay 30% over this amount - for a product at the price of 11,000 rubles, we will pay tax 300 rubles = 30% of 1000 rubles.  You can find out that you have fallen on it by opening the mailbox and receiving a notice that you need to pay a fee. <br><br>  <strong>So everything turned out fine for me, namely:</strong> <br><br>  1. Money Reached <br>  2. The seller did not throw <br>  3. The seller sent a serviceable monitor <br>  4. The package did not crash during the flight. <br>  5. When importing it is not lost. <br>  6. Customs did not steal it <br>  7. Customs did not impose its charges <br>  8. Mail did not break it <br>  9. Mail has not lost her <br>  10. Mail poisoned me a notice on time, and not late (I would have to pay a fine, there are cases) <br>  11. I almost did not turn gray during the waiting. <br><br>  As you can see there are no special risks)) <br><br><h3>  4.Monitor. </h3><br><br><h4>  Specifications: </h4><br><br><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td>  Screen type <br></td><td>  Active-matrix LCD, TFT technology <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Panel type <br></td><td>  IPS <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Screen size <br></td><td>  22 inches (22 inches visible size) <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Preset image area <br></td><td>  473.76 (D) X 296.1 (V) <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Horizontally <br></td><td>  473.76 mm (18.7 inches) <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Vertically <br></td><td>  296.1 mm (11.7 inches) <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Pixel pitch <br></td><td>  0.282 mm <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Viewing angle (typical) <br></td><td>  178 ¬∞ (vertical), 178 ¬∞ (horizontal) <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Screen brightness (typical) <br></td><td>  300 cd / m¬≤ <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Contrast (typical) <br></td><td>  1000 to 1, 3000 to 1 (the standard mode of dynamic contrast is included) <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Front Panel Coating <br></td><td>  Anti-glare with hard coating 3H <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Backlight <br></td><td>  CCFL (6U-lamp) direct backlight system <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Response time (typical) <br></td><td>  6 ms (Gray to Gray) <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Color depth <br></td><td>  16.7 million colors <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Color range (typical) <br></td><td>  83% * <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  * The color gamut for [2209WA] is designed in accordance with the standards for testing CIE1976 (83%) and CIE1931 (72%). <br><br><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td>  Line frequency <br></td><td>  30-83 kHz (auto) <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Frame frequency <br></td><td>  56-75 Hz (auto) <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Preset optimum resolution (frame rate 60 Hz) <br></td><td>  1680 X 1050 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Highest preset resolution (frame rate 75 Hz) <br></td><td>  1680 X 1050 <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2">  <b>Weight</b> <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Shipping Weight <br></td><td>  9.85 kg (21.7 pounds) <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Weight with stand and cables <br></td><td>  7.93 kg (17.50 lbs) <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Weight without rack <br>  (for wall mounting or VESA mounting - without cables) <br></td><td>  5.53 kg (12.19 lbs) <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Rack weight <br></td><td>  1.79 kg (3.95 lb.) <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  <strong>16 days</strong> after receiving the parcel by Austrian mail, she was at my house! <br><br>  And what we saw: <br><br><img src="http://img7.imageshost.ru/imgs/090618/8aace5e3e4/bea7b.jpg"><br>  Wonderful Dell branded box, in my opinion, is an ideal packaging container, it harmonizes perfectly with the color of the tiles in the kitchen and it is not a pity to put potatoes on the balcony.  The box is one of those little things that led me to this company, I can say that now I am a fan of it, however, when I first bought the products of this company I had a slight shock from this packaging, but then I skipped the piece. <br><br>  Opening it apart from the monitor and a rather weighty stand, we find the following things: <br><br><img src="http://img7.imageshost.ru/imgs/090618/ea8d8bb80d/5202d.jpg"><br><br>  1. DVI cable <br>  2. ‚ÄúAscending USB cable‚Äù as it was called in the Russian manual, in general, the cable that connects the monitor and the computer is necessary for the operation of the USB ports on the monitor itself. <br>  3. Power cable <br>  4. VGA cable <br>  5. Waste paper, including, CD-ROM, instructions on how to make this TV show and instructions for use (including Russian) <br><br>  In addition, checks from the Austrian store and a gift from the same store - an iron ballpoint pen with the name of the company made laser engraving. <br><br><h4>  Stand. </h4><br><img src="http://img7.imageshost.ru/imgs/090618/fe53f4d634/7f0b6.jpg"><img src="http://img7.imageshost.ru/imgs/090618/a3c8d68f1b/443aa.jpg"><br><br>  The stand of this monitor deserves special attention.  A work of engineering art, its weight is 1.79 kg, this value is achieved due to the presence in its construction of a developed iron profile with a thickness of just under 10 mm, the monitor is very confident on the table.  She and, therefore, the monitor has 3 degrees of freedom, then it will be illustrated.  The execution at height, the mechanisms for moving the monitor along the grooves are equipped with powerful springs, thanks to which extremely soft and smooth sliding is achieved, this may be normal for modern stands, but for me such a complex structure, such a seemingly simple crap became a revelation. <br><br><h4>  3. Monitor </h4><br><img src="http://img7.imageshost.ru/imgs/090618/30ddeb2a34/b60c6.jpg"><br>  On the back of the monitor are the main connectors: <br>  1. Power <br>  2. "DC Power Connector with Dell Soundbar", I don‚Äôt know how it is normally called <br>  3. DVI connector <br>  4. VGA connector <br>  5. "USB upstream" from monitor to computer <br>  6. 2 USB ports <br>  7. Security lock slot <br>  8. Mounting Brackets for Dell Soundbar Speaker Module <br>  9. 2 USB ports <br>  10. From here the plate with information about the monitor comes out, then a little more detail about it. <br>  11. Button to unfasten the monitor from the stand <br><br><img src="http://img7.imageshost.ru/imgs/090618/051576a3f7/9a0ed.jpg"><br>  This is the most extendable tablet, knowing the trick of Dell, I have an idea that it was made specifically to write Made in Czech.  Let me explain - I also have Made in Ireland written on my laptop, but when you open it, every detail is replete with stickers Made in China, I think that in a laptop only a sticker is made in Ireland, everything else is selected China.  The thought arises that in this monitor only the tablet is made in the Czech Republic, and everything else is clear where.  Nevertheless, the quality is decent. <br><br>  And so the monitor has can do this: <br><br><img src="http://img7.imageshost.ru/imgs/090618/933893cb25/70deb.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://img7.imageshost.ru/imgs/090618/3f1998a188/c79a4.jpg"><br><br>  Vertical Habr in terrible quality: <br><img src="http://img7.imageshost.ru/imgs/090619/40b5557e90/a7db5.jpg"><br><br>  <strong>+ It is possible to twist it around ¬± 30 ¬∞ around its axis; I could not photograph it due to the lack of appropriate equipment and a tripod.</strong> <br><br>  Actually, I cannot tell objectively about the quality of the image, but personally I really like it, especially the blue color.  There is practically no effect of a ‚Äúwet cloth‚Äù; there was some sensation on the first day, but then it passed.  The USB ports on the monitor work as they should - the external 500Gb hard connected to the monitor port is quite fun to spin up.  Viewing angles really impress me after office fellows <br><br>  Regarding the differences between the S-IPS and e-IPS (Enhanced IPS) matrices, which stands in this monitor, wikipedia says the following: <blockquote>  A low-cost ratio to increase the transmittance. </blockquote>  In general, a cheaper matrix than AS-IPS, with a reduced level of contrast, color gamut and glow effect in the corners. <br><br>  Links to foreign reviews I gave at the end of the article.  Next, a picture taken in a professional laboratories (bath) to assess the (not) uniformity of illumination: <br><br><img src="http://img7.imageshost.ru/imgs/090618/1f327793d1/62887.jpg"><br>  This is a black fill shot in absolute darkness with a Canon PS A630 camera with parameters: <br>  Exposure time: 3.22 seconds <br>  Aperture ratio: F2.8 <br>  Sensitivity: ISO100 <br><br>  In my opinion, very nothing even for uniformity.  Naturally, under normal conditions, black looks much more black, this image is only for assessing the uniformity of the backlight.  With a white background, I was not able to take a similar picture. <br><br>  Well, at home: <br><br><img src="http://img7.imageshost.ru/imgs/090618/b38dcb4a1e/c716f.jpg"><br><br>  In general, I advise you to pay attention to this monitor, in its price category (up to 15,000 rubles), in my opinion, it has few competitors. <br><br>  Promised links to foreign tests: <br><br>  <a href="http://www.prad.de/en/monitore/review/2009/review-dell-2209wa.html">Prad.de</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.cnet.com.au/dell-2209wa-339294389.htm">Cnet</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.lcdreviewz.com/review_Dell_2209WA">LCDReviewz</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.erodov.com/forums/dell-ultrasharp-2209wa-review/18048.html">Erodov.com</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.overclock.net/monitors-displays/467862-my-review-dell-2209wa-ips-panel.html">Private review</a> <br><br>  <strong>The monitor was bought at the end of April, then they were not in any form in Russia, as I do not know now.</strong>  <strong>Would be bought in Russia naturally</strong> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/62382/">https://habr.com/ru/post/62382/</a></p>
