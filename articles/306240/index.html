      According to statistics, mobile devices own more than 80% of the world population, and this figure is growing every year.  This encourages business owners to create their own personalized applications and services, allowing them to better interact with customers and understand their needs.  Already in 2013, about 27% of companies around the world introduced location-based services using mobile devices, and by 2017 this figure is projected to grow to 52%.  Outlets, hotels, hospitals and other institutions develop their own personalized applications that allow visitors to get the information they need, not only within the organization itself, but also promotional offers from cafes, shops and entertainment centers, near which the visitor is currently located. <br><br>  Aruba Mobile Engagement personalized mobile solution will help companies in the service sector to interact with their customers in the most effective way.  It uses the existing Wi-Fi infrastructure in the building, as well as Aruba Beacons technology with easy-to-deploy beacons.  Thanks to him, it is possible to organize simple access to the wireless network, send personalized push messages and implement navigation services in the premises for users of mobile devices based on their personal profiles and location data in the building. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d01/5de/19e/d015de19ee934af686c98c728ba9a190.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Up to date</b> <br><br>  Notifications are delivered to device users via the Aruba ClearPass Guest Advertising service.  To do this, the service uses Aruba Meridian mobile applications or a browser of a smartphone or tablet.  It is worth noting that Aruba Mobile Engagement does not register or store information about the user, and also requires him to confirm the activation of the service in several stages.  ClearPass Guest provides the visitor with a unique guest portal with its own user profile, through which it will receive various offers.  Moreover, advertising is displayed depending on the preferences of the visitor, his location, time of day and other criteria.  If the client does not want to receive notifications, he can easily unsubscribe from the service.  It is worth noting that Aruba Mobile Engagement does not register or store user information in order to avoid confidentiality issues. <br><br>  <b>Lighthouse system</b> <br><br>  Aruba Mobile Engagement locates the client for sending relevant alerts to its mobile device using special Aruba Beacons beacons that receive a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signal.  In addition, thanks to them, visitors themselves can determine their location in the building and plan the best route to the right part of it. <br><br>  Beacons can be connected to wireless access points via the USB port or be built into the points themselves.  The management of all beacons is provided by the Meridian Editor Content Management System cloud system.  This system allows you to customize the work of each Aruba Beacons and control them from a single panel.  You can also use Aruba Sensor (AS-100), which controls the beacons within a radius of 25 meters and at the same time acts as a regular beacon.  This sensor collects data from beacons and via Wi-Fi sends it to the Meridian Editor cloud for later analysis. <br><br>  <b>Arena Heart</b> <br><br>  One of the most notable projects using Aruba Mobile Engagement was the new home of the San Francisco 49ers football club - Levi's Stadium, a sports and leisure complex of 172,000 m¬≤, which seats 68,500 spectators.  The stadium's telecommunications network is based on Aruba mobile technologies, which ensures the efficient transfer of exclusive content, building information and services to fans.  This allowed the creation of a personal mobile information center for each fan inside the arena - fans can instantly view replays, create routes inside the building and order food and drinks directly from their devices. <br><br>  For questions, contact: <u>aruba@muk.ua</u> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/306240/">https://habr.com/ru/post/306240/</a></p>
