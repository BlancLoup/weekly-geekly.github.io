At the workshops, both theoretically and practically, the features and logic of the operating system, which is installed on all Juniper equipment lines, were considered.

      It was not a simple seminar - in the form of a theoretical basis, but there was a real workshop in which the audience tried to do something with their own hands, to set up the SRX gateways. <br><br>  Under the cut report, the video recording of the workshop and cheat sheets, which were distributed to the audience - <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Juniper equipment that listeners have configured is 3 in one: switching, routing, and encrypted traffic. <br><br>  Examples of Juniper equipment with which the students worked: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/27b/555/8a9/27b5558a9ff74647bc61de7b560dec7d.jpg"><br><br>  SRX100 Gateway <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4b9/9b8/049/4b99b8049442489ead1328695bc4c0cc.jpg"><br><br>  SRX220 mashrutizer <br><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td>  Dimensions (H x W x D) <br></td><td>  1.73 in.  x 14.29 in.  x 7.13 in. <br><br>  44 mm x 363 mm x 181 mm <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Chassis weight <br></td><td><ul><li>  4.52 lb (2.05 kg) for SRX220 models without PoE (no interface modules) </li><li>  4.62 lb (2.10 kg) for SRX220 models with PoE (no interface modules) </li></ul><br></td></tr><tr><td>  Altitude <br></td><td>  No performance degradation up to 10,000 ft (3048 m) <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Temperature <br></td><td>  Normal operation ensured in a temperature range of 32 ¬∞ F (0 ¬∞ C) to 104 ¬∞ F (40 ¬∞ C) <br><br>  Non-operating storage temperature in shipping container: -40 ¬∞ F (-40 ¬∞ C) to 158 ¬∞ F (70 ¬∞ C) <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Maximum thermal output <br><br>  <strong>Note:</strong> These specifications are subject to change. <br></td><td><ul><li>  SRX220 Services Gateway without PoE and Mini-PIMs: 126 BTU / hour (37 W) </li><li>  Mini-PIMs and without PoE SRX220 Services Gateway: 205 BTU / hour (60 W) </li><li>  SRX220 Services Gateway with PoE and without Mini-PIMs: 327 BTU / hour (96 W) </li><li>  SRX220 Services Gateway with PoE and Two Mini-PIMs: 692 BTU / hour (203 W) </li></ul><br></td></tr><tr><td>  Noise level <br></td><td>  51.1 dB per EN ISO 7779 <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b13/7c5/fab/b137c5fabd9a44e48312d30f4468ec22.jpg"><br><br>  On each desk there were 2 ‚Äúglands‚Äù that were in the same AS and it was necessary to make basic interface settings, aggregation, configure OSPF, raise BGP and configure route announcements. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c39/9dd/f1b/c399ddf1b7c5428b84ab2c6d0e857785.jpg"><br><br>  The Vorkoshop was technical, it was so hardcore that the managers left without understanding a word, and for engineers it was a paradise!  During the workshop, the instructor made reference comparisons with competitors and peers all the time, so that students who already have experience with similar solutions can compare the work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ed3/203/474/ed3203474edf44a7bd40cbf8c9fc9c54.jpg"><br><br>  It is clear that it was not possible to cover the entire huge pool of JunOS teams, but the workshop served as a base for those engineers who plan to continue working with JunOS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f09/42a/e70/f0942ae7038548cdbefdce75c0f7a529.jpg"><br><br>  The instructor laid out in front of the students a very large range of equipment configurations.  The instructor himself has a great deal of practical experience in customizing solutions that he talked about, all the time giving examples of how and where it works. <br><br>  <b>A few words about Juniper in Ukraine</b> .  Juniper's customers in Ukraine are various types of providers: from home Internet providers to hosting providers.  The largest implementation of Juniper solutions and technologies in Ukraine is Ukrtelecom. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8ef/c6f/bbc/8efc6fbbc812446398a2c3a4b2a5dd21.jpg"><br><br>  Juniper has a single management console, the instructor touched on all aspects of network console settings.  In particular, much attention was paid to the configuration of the equipment.  Especially when equipment is configured for 2-3 people or more, scenarios were considered how to make everything in the equipment configuration transparent, especially since Juniper never use proprietary protocols in its solutions. <br><br>  What else to tell? <br>  Since Juniper and TC MUK plans to conduct such workshops regularly, the audience was asked about which area among the large selection of Juniper students would like to practice. <br><br>  Here is a video of the entire seminar.  Since this is a workshop, for the most part, it is the practical development of the necessary skills and experience, we have not deciphered the transcript, as we usually do.  For the reason that the answers, labs, cases that the students did were situational and were sent to the educational process "here and now." <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/gbLIt_huuA8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhi8jOdm1gnl985PAUER_JTk2jAWbw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  But, for those who still want to get acquainted in detail with the recording of the workshop, we apply the <a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview%3Fid%3D0B76-va_DYT73fjUyeGNxTnVHX01MVDZGanhZYU5jUzk2ZnhLbVlIYldXSTVWUmQ0VkZ4U1k%26usp%3Dsharing">cheat sheets</a> , which were at the disposal of the workshop participants.
