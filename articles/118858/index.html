This is usually followed by an irritated response from the author.  The commentator makes an offended face, puts a minus for answering him and also complains to the community ‚ÄúI want the best, but I‚Äôm here ...‚Äù. <br><br>  I myself as the author of many articles more than once got into this situation.  And regularly notice it in other topics.  I want to deal a little with this situation. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To make it easier to understand what I mean, consider and analyze a few examples. <br><br><h2>  Example one </h2><br>  <i>By the way, yes ... <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/conference/118673/">I would like the</a> video immediately, well, or 1-2 days after the konfa itself.</i>  <i>I myself did not get to konfa because</i>  <i>At this time there were TechDays 2011 in Belgium.</i>

      What follows, in my opinion, follows a perfectly logical <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/conference/118673/">answer</a> : <br><br>  <i>Fantastically strange desire.</i>  <i>You were not at the conference, what's the difference when you see the video?</i>  <i>Probably more and all at once.</i>  <i>Alas, I have to disappoint, there are no pills for greed either ...</i> <br><br>  It seems rude.  Far from it.  I myself often answer that way.  The thing is that such requests are extremely annoying.  You do not believe?  We will conduct an experiment: <br><br>  But it would be nice if everyone who reads this post would immediately try to download the new version of PVS-Studio 4.20 and unsubscribe that he was able to find interesting things. <br><br>  Did you want to listen to me and do it?  Of course not.  First, you don't owe me anything.  And secondly, this is a disproportionate level of forces that needs to be applied.  I have the strength to write one sentence within 20 seconds.  You need at least 1-4 hours of valuable work. <br><br>  The same with the given example. <br><br>  The costs of the article commentator: <br><br>  1) Write a comment. <br><br>  2) Put a minus for the answer.  Well, or not, if the author apologizes and promises to correct the next time. <br><br>  3) Write another comment in the spirit of "Well, you see, what a lazy / bad this author is." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/553/da3/d2b/553da3d2b3ac6817fb4c2146ac47e8c9.png"><br><br>  Compare, this is with the volume that is offered to the author of the note: <br><br>  1) Quit all things, forget about food and family, postpone other work and engage in the urgent order of putting video. <br><br>  2) At the same time, since the video is not clamped instantly, then buy and configure an additional powerful computer for this.  And even a couple of computers. <br><br>  Agree not proportional efforts.  This is a very good example.  Others will not be so bright, but more ordinary for Habr. <br><br>  What else is overlooked is that the advice to the author is really completely confused, although it sounds formal and logical.  It will not change anything and can not help speeding up.  It only annoys the author who tried so hard / and tries, and on a voluntary basis. <br><br><h3>  Example two </h3><br>  <i>The meaning of the comparison is vector :: iterator, because in all sane implementations in the release it is optimized in T *.</i>  <i>It <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/cpp/113661/">would be</a> much more <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/cpp/113661/">interesting to</a> see how things are with other horse collectors (map, set).</i> <br><br>  The costs of the article commentator: <br><br>  1) Write a comment. <br><br>  2) Put a minus for the answer to the author, if he does not like it. <br><br>  Compare, this is with the volume that is offered to the author of the note: <br><br>  1) Quit other cases and start exploring the behavior of other iterators. <br><br>  2) Rewrite this article or write a new article. <br><br>  At the same time, not the fact that a person is so interested in all this.  He probably more and does not look into this thread.  So it is tempting to answer in the spirit: "Take it yourself, compare and write about the results." <br><br><h2>  Example three </h2><br>  <i><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/infosecurity/118483/">If you wrote an example of a driver</a> hiding a process, attached a few schematic images of lists of structures, then the post would have a chance to get a good mark.</i> <br><br>  The costs of the article commentator: <br><br>  1) Write a comment. <br><br>  2) Put a minus for the answer to the author, if he does not like it. <br><br>  Compare, this is with the volume that is offered to the author of the note: <br><br>  1) Quit other things and write a driver. <br><br>  2) Rewrite this article or write a new article. <br><br>  Well done, explained to the man how to write articles.  Then what?  In this case, the one who advises, he wrote himself only 2 articles.  And the one who is advised is 14 articles.  I don‚Äôt even want to answer this question.  What the author of the article does. <br><br><h2>  Fourth example </h2><br>  <i><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/erp_systems/115015/">It would be nice if the</a> authors of such materials would give at least a brief educational program on basic terms and abbreviations.</i>  <i>The article is interesting, but what ERP is is not clear</i> <br><br>  Well, here the good defeated evil and the commentary zaminusovali.  But usually these are just a plus.  For formally they are true and useful.  In practice, no one benefits anyone.  Yes, and redoing already done is not so easy. <br><br>  Similar examples can be found on Habr√© a huge amount.  I have not collected the best examples, but I cannot remember where, when and what I saw.  I hope in general, I set out examples of situations clearly. <br><br><h2>  Why am I doing all this? </h2><br>  Dear Habrovchane.  I beg your request.  As soon as you start to write a comment, where there are the words ‚Äúit would be good‚Äù, ‚ÄúI would like‚Äù, ‚Äúif‚Äù, then stop and think.  Perhaps your comment is superfluous and you only upset the author and bring no public benefit to them.  After all, the author tried. <br><br>  If, nevertheless, you are sure that the article is missing something, then better help.  Write a detailed comment with your thoughts and unlisted authors nuances.  Offer him assistance in video processing.  Suggest, measure the speed of the algorithms on another compiler.  This is much better and more useful than pointing out the flaws. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/118858/">https://habr.com/ru/post/118858/</a></p>
