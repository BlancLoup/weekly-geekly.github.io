We asked the head of Kingston‚Äôs Russian office, Alexei Knyazev, to explain what this means.  And at the same time asked him a few questions about the work of the company's representative office in Russia.  To, as they say, do not get up twice. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/969/d8c/83a/969d8c83a0c4411391fa204d2f6cfdec.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, if you have questions - ask in the comments, give! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  <font color="872323">Why is the company logo showing a red stone head resembling an idol from Easter Island?</font> </h3><br>  The history of the appearance of the logo of the company Kingston in 1989.  This was a man who inserted a memory module into his head.  At the same time, the slogan ‚ÄúImprove your memory‚Äù appeared.  The logo has changed several times, the last edition appeared in 2003 and still exists.  By the way, the red head has a name - Rex.

    <h3>  <font color="872323">Has Kingston's office been operating in Russia for a long time?</font>  <font color="872323">How many employees are there?</font> </h3><br>  Russian representative office opened in 2012.  Now there are 8 people working there - business development specialists, marketers and "techies".  We cooperate with partners throughout Russia, from Kaliningrad to Vladivostok, and also provide support to clients from Russia and the Republic of Belarus.  By the way, we have a free (only for residents of the Russian Federation) technical support hotline: 8 (800) 700-13-50.  By calling this number, you can get advice on the entire product line of the company. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/676/4a5/d03/6764a5d03c494366ba5ce385959875fd.jpg"><br><br><h3>  <font color="872323">Memory, SSD and Kingston flash drives are popular in Russia?</font>  <font color="872323">What are your local representation plans for the future?</font> </h3><br>  Yes, popular.  On the question "What kind of <a href="http://www.kingston.com/ru/usb">flash drive</a> do you use?" C is very likely you will get the answer: "Kingston".  And the <a href="http://www.kingston.com/ru/memory">RAM</a> and <a href="http://www.kingston.com/ru/ssd">SSD</a> have long and firmly taken their place in the servers, personal computers and laptops of Russian consumers. <br><br>  We plan to become even closer to the end user, no matter who it is - a flash drive buyer, a professional gamer or a large corporation.  We constantly hold contests and activities in social networks, organize <a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/special_offers/moscow/Kingston_competition">interesting promotions</a> and programs with popular online stores, organize exhibitions, conferences, seminars, technical trainings, etc.  We are not going to stop yet. <br><br><h3>  <font color="872323">What are they working for in the company?</font>  <font color="872323">There are priority areas?</font> </h3><br>  We constantly expand our product line and pay maximum attention to the development of the <a href="http://www.kingston.com/ru/hyperx">HyperX</a> brand.  Devices for gamers and enthusiasts are manufactured under this brand: high-speed USB-drives, high-performance SSDs and high-frequency RAM for desktops and laptops.  We recently started producing gaming headsets.  The first models - <a href="http://www.kingston.com/ru/hyperx/cloud">HyperX Cloud</a> and <a href="http://www.kingston.com/ru/hyperx/cloud">HyperX Cloud II</a> - have already become popular among professional gamers and just fans of playing computer games in their free time.  Fans of various kinds of gadgets will like the <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/kingston_technology/blog/244820/">Kingston MobileLite Wireless</a> wireless device.  It will extend battery life and expand the memory capacity of smartphones and tablets - and this is only two of its five main functions.  Our corporate customers are not ignored either: we have released the <a href="http://www.kingston.com/ru/ssd/enterprise/">E50</a> and <a href="http://www.kingston.com/ru/ssd/enterprise/">E100</a> SSD lines for high-performance server systems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fc6/44c/4ac/fc644c4ac4a348e39c2a3acac8a151bd.jpg"><br><br><h3>  <font color="872323">When, in your opinion, will there be a massive transition to DDR4 standard memory and is Kingston ready for this?</font> </h3><br>  DDR3 is a balanced and technically well-thought-out standard; it fully satisfies user requirements in terms of frequency characteristics and capacity.  The first DDR3 memory modules began to be sold in 2007 and still dominate the market.  You must admit that it is difficult to reach the new standard, while the previous one completely copes with its tasks. <br><br>  However, it is a matter of time.  Processor and chipset manufacturers are releasing new solutions that can improve system performance.  First of all, they are interesting to gamers and enthusiasts.  That is why we released the DDR4 memory line under the HyperX brand - it focuses on just such an audience.  I think serious sales will be visible by the 4th quarter of 2015. <br><br>  It‚Äôs too early to talk about a massive transition to the DDR4 segment of office PCs and workstations; first, budget processors and motherboards with low-cost chipsets should appear. <br><br><h3>  <font color="872323">How is Kingston doing with the development of new technologies?</font>  <font color="872323">Do you have engineers from Russia?</font> </h3><br>  We are constantly developing and introducing new technologies.  We pay special attention to testing operational and flash memory (we have as many as 29 patents!).  By the way, a representative of Kingston is on the board of directors of <a href="https://www.jedec.org/about-jedec/board-directors">JEDEC</a> , the committee for engineering semiconductor products standardization. <br>  In Kingston, people from various countries, including from the USSR, work. <br><br>  Thank you for your attention, stay with us on Geektimes.ru! <br><br><h5>  <font color="872323">Our previous posts:</font> </h5><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/kingston_technology/blog/249464/">Overview of the DDR4 HyperX Fury RAM kit with a frequency of 2133 MHz</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/kingston_technology/blog/248898/">HyperX Predator PCI-E SSD Review</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/kingston_technology/blog/248902/">Be careful, fake!</a>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/kingston_technology/blog/248902/">How to make out Kingston fake USB drives in time</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/kingston_technology/blog/245426/">Factory Tour in China</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/367197/">https://habr.com/ru/post/367197/</a></p>
