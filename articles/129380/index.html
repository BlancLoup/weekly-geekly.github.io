But after using 3 weeks, I don‚Äôt really want to give it back :) I replaced the iPhone with it and will compare it with it. <br><br><h4>  Iron </h4><br>  The device is made in the slider form factor, rather small, slightly thicker than the iPhone in thickness.

    <img src="http://int18h.ru/static/images/2011/09/29/3e95c806.JPG" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://int18h.ru/static/images/2011/09/29/63122148.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  The slider mechanism does not dangle, it opens with one hand calmly, but at the same time it holds up well, there is an automatic finishing. <br>  The keyboard is full qwerty, very small, but comfortable keys, with my men's hands, I calmly hit the keys and type the text with one or both hands (thumbs). <br>  The back cover, according to the manufacturer, is made of metal, I feel like they believe :) In 3 weeks it fell several times on tiles from about one and a half meters (small for a male hand, sometimes it falls out), did not find any scratches or found any damage. <br>  The screen is small, but with sufficient resolution.  Clear, the text is well read in the sun. <br><br><img src="http://int18h.ru/static/images/2011/09/29/6fbbad88.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  The device has a volume rocker, vibro / sound, a power button and the main, control. <br>  Here the control button is made very interesting, it is highlighted with any notifications, and also serves as a means of control and navigation through the system.  Because  touch button (a thin slit with a traveling light wave / string), then it understands gestures: <br>  - the main gesture, with a finger from right to left and we move to the previous menu <br>  - from left to right <br>  - press (returns to the main menu) <br>  The SIM card compartment is located at the top and is covered with a rubber stopper, unfortunately it is not intended for frequent replacement of SIM cards (it is very difficult to remove the SIM card) <br><br><h4>  operating system </h4><br>  The device has installed WebOS 2.1 and updates to version 3, in the light of recent events, I can hardly wait ... <br>  WebOS is a very pleasant system, moderately beautiful, fast, with its own characteristics.  Unfortunately, there is no Russian interface, but contacts, sms, mail in Russian are normally displayed, there is also a patch to the keyboard to write. <br>  Among the chips that I really liked, you can select a notification system (I didn‚Äôt see it better in iOS or Android).  All notifications, as well as demons (for managing background programs), leave an icon in the bottom line of the screen, and when you click on it, display a notification, or a control menu. <br><br><img src="http://int18h.ru/static/images/2011/09/29/cc0d1630.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Very nice job done with multitasking.  All applications open side by side with each other (even the browser opens a new window when opening a new tab) with a screenshot of the last state of the application.  To close a program, it must be "thrown" up the screen. <br><br><img src="http://int18h.ru/static/images/2011/09/29/b19d8924.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The OS supports out of the Google account box and allows you to synchronize your contacts and calendar with it.  Also, at the OS level, you can add various other services (twitter, fuisbook, VKontakte) at the expense of the Synergy system.  Unfortunately, because  I do not use social networks, I did not put this patch :) <br><br>  Some OS screenshots: <br><br><img src="http://int18h.ru/static/images/2011/09/29/d68c1aac.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://int18h.ru/static/images/2011/09/29/e781d2c0.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://int18h.ru/static/images/2011/09/29/fa96fa16.png" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  Work with the network </h5><br>  There are no problems with the work on GPRS, there are Ukrainian operators in the database (mts, Kyivstar started working right away). <br>  GPS also works quickly, Google maps are installed, location is shown. <br>  The work of WiFi is sometimes with problems, about 2 times the phone connected to the network (familiar), but there was no Internet, perhaps the routs did not catch on :( <br>  But I often use bluetooth and I am not satisfied with his work.  The Sony DR-BT21G paired headset sometimes connects immediately and sometimes 2 minutes. Also, about 1 time out of three the sound does not switch to the headset and does not play at all, this problem is solved only by resetting the device :( <br><br><h4>  Software installation </h4><br>  Software is installed in several ways. <br><ul><li>  From the store right on the phone (in my region only free programs are available) </li><li>  Through the likeness of Cydia </li><li>  Through the program WebOSQuickInstall from the computer </li></ul><br>  To install 2 and 3, no hacking of the phone is required, except for entering the phone into developer mode (a combination of keys in the phone book).  Also, in addition to software in the .ipk format, system patches are very common, which can change the behavior of the system very much. <br><br><h4>  Battery </h4><br>  The battery is not removable, as on the iPhone.  The phone on average lives for 2 days, with 10-15 minutes of talk per day, 15 minutes of WiFi and 2 hours of listening to music through a BT headset.  Sometimes there are strange "devouring" of the battery, it can sit for 8-12 hours completely, even without a load. <br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br>  HP Veer is a very solid female device with a pleasant and understandable OS that both girls and boys like (all the girls who gave the phone in their hands really wanted to keep it, barely picked it up).  The OS itself leaves only good impressions of work and I liked it more than Android and iOS.  If HP does not bury WebOS, then my next machine will be some top Pre. <br><br>  <b>UPD: The Russian patch is called Russian Layout for Hardware Keyboard.</b>  <b>Good forum on web in Russian</b> <br>  <b>UPD2: It is still plastic at the back, today it fell again - a crack: (</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/129380/">https://habr.com/ru/post/129380/</a></p>
