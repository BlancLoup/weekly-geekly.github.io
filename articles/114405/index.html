Who among them and what was the first in the open spaces of Bynet? <br><br>  Finding a Belarusian who was lucky enough to be the first to get on the Internet today is probably difficult.  It is only known that the Belarusians received access to e-mail in 1991 through the Internet / Relcom network site. <br><br>  <b>The first official ISP</b> was Solo (1991).  But for about five to seven years, access to the Internet remained the chosen one.  According to eyewitnesses, even in 1998, the cost of an hour of Internet access was $ 3.

      <b>The domain zone .BY</b> was registered by the company Open Contact in May 1994.  In the summer of 1995 a web appeared in Belarus - that is, the Internet in the form in which we used to see it through the browser window.  In the next two years, the first sites on Belarusian domains began to open in Bynet. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The address of the very first Belarusian site also seems to remain a secret.  But the <b>first media site</b> in Bynet appeared in the newspaper ‚ÄúEvening Minsk‚Äù <a href="http://newsvm.com/">newsvm.com</a> (1996).  Today, 14 years later, the site is alive and well at the same address. <br><br>  <b>The first hosting provider</b> is GIS (1996).  The payment for hosting a simple corporate website at that time was $ 600 per year.  At the end of 2010, the average cost of hosting in Belarus was $ 70 per year. <br><br>  <b>The first site directory</b> appeared in the summer of 1997 at <a href="http://www.data.minsk.by/info/">www.data.minsk.by/info</a> .  With its help, Belarusians have become easier to navigate in - at that time - a small but growing Bynet.  By 1997, there were about 30 sites on Belarusian domains.  The second-level domain names in the .BY zone at that time were not available to Belarusians, therefore many Belarusian sites were located on third-level domains of the form name.minsk.by and name.org.by. <br><br>  <b>The first Belarusian Internet cafe</b> was opened in 1998 in Minsk, on Nemiga, with the support of Hewlett-Packard.  The speed of Internet access there was 512 kbits / s (with a total speed of access in Belarus of 2 Mbit / s). <br><br>  <b>The first media outlet exclusively online</b> , was the Internet newspaper Open.by (1999).  The project exists today.  True, it has long been inferior in popularity to other Belarusian Internet media and portals.  The leader in the Belarusian market was TUT.by, which started Open.by a year later. <br><br>  OZ.by is considered to be the <b>first Belarusian online store</b> , where in 1999 it was possible to buy books, videotapes, and computer games.  Over the years, the range of the store has been significantly expanded.  Now you can buy a wide variety of goods - from thuja seeds to personal hygiene items. <br><br>  <b>The first trading platform</b> is shop.by (2000).  Its appearance marked the beginning of the development of electronic commerce in Belarus.  Already in 2001, in the pre-New Year period, the turnover of the shops of the shop.by network amounted to 400 thousand dollars.  According to the Ministry of Commerce, in 2008 there were 700 online stores in Bynet.  At the end of 2010, their number reached 3,000. <br><br>  In 2001, Belinfonet was the first to provide <b>services based on ADSL technology</b> .  But prices for the first time "bite."  The subscriber had to pay about $ 700 for the connection, and then pay a monthly fee of $ 85 and pay for traffic. <br><br>  EasyPay.by became the <b>first Belarusian system of instant online payments</b> .  The first announcements of the system appeared in Bynet in April 2002.  But due to the lack of a legislative base, the launch of the project was postponed for two years.  The payment system Easypay.by became a joint project of Belgazprombank and the Open Contact Company and began work on November 9, 2004.  Today, more than 500 online stores and about 400 service providers are connected to the system. <br><br>  <b>The first truly affordable unlimited tariff</b> for home users in 2005 was provided by Alternative Digital Network, as part of the Shparki Damavik brand using ADSL technology.  Belarusian users got the opportunity to work on the Internet, not counting megabytes and hours, for 54,500 rubles a month. <br><br>  <b>The first independent domain name registrar</b> is Hoster.by (the trademark belongs to UE Reliable Programs) (2007).  In 2010, the company won the tender and was appointed technical administrator of the .by zone. <br><br>  The registration of the <b>first legal Ethernet-network was</b> carried out by the company Alternative Digital Network (2009).  New packet technology to provide broadband access services quickly gained the trust of Belarusians. <br><br>  Would you like to add this information?  We appreciate your comments, memories and new facts! <br><br>  We thank Alexander Chekan (TUT.by) and Mikhail Doroshevich (Gemius) for help in preparing the material. <br><br>  <i>* users over 15;</i>  <i>data of the international research company Gemius for October 2010</i> <i><br></i>  <i>** as of October 2010</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/114405/">https://habr.com/ru/post/114405/</a></p>
