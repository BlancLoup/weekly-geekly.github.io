Our experience shows that customers prefer to combine data from <a href="http://ringostat.com/">Ringostat</a> with their corporate CRM systems by API.  You can read about the integration mechanism in our other <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/ringostat/blog/22158/">article</a> on the Megamind. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/ad9/5e2/60f/ad95e260f47e7276f3eb75b036fabaea.jpg" alt="image">

      Our other clients, most often small or medium-sized businesses, which are just starting to work on the Internet, use Google Spreadsheets or simply Excel reports.  It is also a convenient tool for analytical work and planning. <br><br>  Whatever reporting tools you use, it will be helpful to know what data you should focus on when analyzing calls. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We offer 8 parameters that need to be considered: <br><br><h2>  1. TOP keywords that lead incoming calls </h2><br>  Call tracking is able to generate and generate such a list in a special report.  These keywords will help the marketer analyze the semantic field, which is attractive for those who prefer calls. <br><br>  Working with keywords is the basis for optimizing your campaigns in Google Adowrds and Yandex.Direct.  It allows you to supplement your ad campaigns with data about offline conversions (calls) and review their value. <br><br><h2>  2. TOP advertising campaigns that generate a conversion through calls </h2><br>  The second indicator aggregates data by keywords and gives the results on global performance in attracting calls using contextual advertising.  Such a ranking allows you to assess how profitable the time of displaying ads is and choose to rebuild the message if the flow of telephone calls is below the average for your marketing activity. <br><br><h2>  3. The percentage of potential customers who call, to the total number of applications </h2><br>  This is one of the key parameters along with the total attendance of your resource, which we use when we recommend or do not recommend the use of call tracking.  In detail about the calculation of profitability recently <a href="http://rusbase.com/opinion/call-tracking/">wrote the</a> head of the service Ringostat Alexander Maximenyuk. <br><br>  If this parameter were static, it would not be worthwhile to include calls into our ‚Äúnavigation bar‚Äù, but the dynamics are significant.  Call Tracking will allow you to keep a ‚Äúfinger on the pulse‚Äù and observe the seasonal features of customer preferences in the choice of communication methods. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/e65/d99/1f7/e65d991f7866bce56170a1ab4de62866.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  4. The ratio of calls from the ads and made after visiting the site </h2><br>  It all depends on whether a preliminary ‚Äúwarming up‚Äù of clients is necessary before communication.  If you sell a simple unified service, then there is a chance to get a high conversion rate even from ads.  But if you have a complex product, you should take into account the multi-stage sales process and the fact that it will be difficult to sell after the first call, especially without visiting the site. <br><br>  Control of the ratio of telephone conversions from ads and the site allows you to adjust the best work on the flow of users.  For some campaigns, you can choose one strategy with direct calls, for others - think through several steps at once.  The presence of this indicator increases the number of opportunities to develop a better marketing solution. <br><br><h2>  5. Duration of calls </h2><br>  This parameter is of particular importance, since the filter on it allows you to get the TOP of the most long and useful for the analysis of sales department conversations.  In the absence of normal voice recognition, this is a good way to select calls worth listening to. <br><br>  Analysis of long conversations will assess the professionalism of call-center employees or simply those responsible for working with clients.  In addition, you can get detailed information about what your customers are most worried about and what attracts and raises questions. <br><br>  It is also worth adding that listening to calls and comparing their duration will help determine how long the target call corresponds to your business. <br><br><h2>  6. Information about the geographic location where the calls come from </h2><br>  This data is provided by Google Analytics, and call tracking services allow you to bind to specific phone calls.  By tracking these indicators, you can always track how a particular region reacts to your advertising in the context of calls. <br><br>  The functionality of Google Adwords can further detail the definition of geo-targeting, up to and including metro stops.  Such detailing allows you to better understand the behavior of your customers, to assess in which situation they are prone to a call, and in which they prefer to communicate using instant messengers and email. <br><br><h2>  7. Ratio of unique, uniquely targeted, first-targeted and repeated calls </h2><br>  A good benchmark for the formation of sales funnels and the improvement of advertising campaigns separately, depending on what status the call has.  In addition, the ratio allows you to constantly evaluate what group of clients are currently spending advertising money, and to correlate, both with short-term profit, and in terms of long-term benefits (LifeTime Value). <br><br><h2>  8. Profit from calls </h2><br>  The last parameter in order, but not least, to be monitored to successfully manage the conversion of calls, is the direct profit from sales by phone.  By combining data from call tracking with commercial information from CRM, you can calculate margins for marketing costs. <br><br>  In addition, profit estimates due to telephone sales in the context of different periods may be interesting from the point of view of strategic planning of advertising costs for your business. <br><br><h1>  Call tracking allows you to work out your individual dashboard. </h1><br>  Unlike many tools, call tracking does not impose certain behaviors depending on the data received.  This is due to the fact that the specifics of different industries can be completely different and it is impossible to develop universal algorithms. <br><br>  However, by tracking the 8 indicators presented above, you can figure out what telephone communications are specifically for your business.  Evaluating financial indicators, socio-demographic characteristics of users, temporal dynamics of correlations and data on advertising campaigns, you can build a competent marketing strategy. <br><br>  Call Conversion Dashboard based on Call Tracking data is a progressive approach that will ensure efficient distribution of the marketing budget and productive work with the sales staff. <br><br>  <b>And what parameter set do you use?</b>  <b>So you can add to our list?</b> <br><br>  Learn more about call tracking on the <a href="http://blog.ringostat.com/">Ringostat blog</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299544/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299544/</a></p>
