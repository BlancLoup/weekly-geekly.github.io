  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Termination of the Makhost services</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Over the last month, the company ‚ÄúOversan-Mercury‚Äù received a lot of attention and positive feedback from Habralyudy, publishing detailed information about its data center and the process of its construction.  Therefore, it is here, in Habr√©, that we would like to explain why the Oversan-Mercury company is forced to suspend the provision of services to the Makhost company. <br><br>  In its desire to change the bleak situation prevailing in the data center and hosting market in our country, Oversan-Mercury found an opportunity to build a truly outstanding data center and offer its services primarily to young, promising companies able to bring the market to a new one. level.  One of these companies was the company Makhost (in the past - McHost). <br><br>  In the spring of 2009, Makhost moved its server park to our data center.  The specialists of the Oversan-Mercury company helped the Makhost company to implement some services demanded in the market by optimizing the server equipment, designing and laying a special SCS, and introducing the Anti-DDoS services.  Having gained access to duplicated backbone channels with a capacity of up to 70 Gbit / s, and passing them off as their own, Makhost launched a large-scale advertising campaign.  Within its framework, besides other opportunities, clients were attracted by the offer of free unlimited traffic.  At the same time, the details of the Makhost business model were not disclosed, and the origin of such favorable conditions remained unknown to customers.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  By fully providing data center services and data transmission, Oversan-Mercury provided invoices to Makhost.  Timely and full payment of the bills was not made, however, having a certain reserve of trust in a promising partner who was actively increasing its customer base, Oversan-Mercury did not demand immediate payment for the services rendered.  Only thanks to the friendly attitude of our partners, including Internet service providers, was it possible to avoid conflict situations and retain the opportunity to continue full-fledged work.  The credit of trust also reinforced the fact that previously the Makhost company collaborated with the data center of the well-known company Synterra.  However, in the end, having made several incomplete payments, the Makhost company completely stopped payments to the Oversan-Mercury company. <br><br>  For more than six months, despite repeated warnings and attempts to resolve the current situation on the part of Oversun-Mercury, Makhost did not pay for the services provided, simultaneously attracting customers.  Any attempts to rectify the situation, mitigate his guilt, or at least develop a plan of action to break the deadlock, were defiantly not taken by Makhost.  The final date for the demonstration of goodwill and the desire to find a compromise was appointed on April 1.  On the onset of this date, the company "Makhost" did not respond, probably, considering the demands submitted an April Fool's joke. <br><br>  The last straw that broke our patience was the information that Makhost was looking for a new data center to host its server park.  It was aggravated by the fact that, according to information received from Synterra, when moving to our data center, Makhost also did not pay for the services provided.  It became obvious that this could not continue. <br><br>  As a result of the actions of Makhost, its customers who believed in ‚Äúreally free traffic‚Äù became hostages of the current situation. <br><br>  In the light of recent events related to hosting companies in Russia, Oversan-Mercury would like to draw attention to the efforts made to prevent the stopping of the provision of services to the Makhost company.  I would also like to emphasize that the decision to terminate the provision of services to Makhost was caused by its refusal to fulfill its obligations. <br><br>  <strong>We inform that in the near future there will be a termination of the provision of services to the company Makhost.</strong>  <strong>This will entail the suspension of access to sites and services hosted on the facilities of this company.</strong> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/90171/">https://habr.com/ru/post/90171/</a></p>
