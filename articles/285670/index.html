My story is different, not entirely logical, but it was forced.  First he moved, and only then he looked for work. <br>  I am a front-end developer, quite average in skill and experience (maybe for some it will be important). <br><br>  Now, when I'm here, when many of my friends from the IT industry are interested in Minsk, if not the most difficult option to go somewhere, when I got a job and went through a very sad procedure of paperwork, I have something to tell. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  First impression </h4><br>  It was formed at the end of May, since I first visited this city as a tourist.  About such trivial things as cleanliness, modern and clearly-scheduled transport, which are quite capable in any situation (even at rush hour) to help and prompt the townspeople - a lot has been said. <br><br>  I will add a little from myself.  Considering that I am from Kiev - getting lost or just not feeling comfortable when searching for an address is almost impossible.  For Muscovites - even more so.  Many interviews were completed (about this below), the addresses were quickly and simply, I was not late for any interviews (half of merit is mine. I don‚Äôt like to be late. And the city helped me with this).  By my subjective standards, everything is close, and if not so, then it is also close.

    <h4>  Renting an apartment </h4><br>  There was no time to prepare, I was already looking for an apartment in Minsk.  The day after the arrival, the first ‚Äúlive‚Äù interview was scheduled.  HR entered my position and helped me.  Therefore, the hotel for the first few days did not have to rent.  One guy from their company responded and put me at home.  In the end, I lived with him for two weeks.  After - moved to a removable.  It is worth saying that the offer in this organization was not offered to me. <br><br>  About prices, again, judging by Kiev standards.  Here is more expensive.  Be prepared to pay for a one-room apartment from 350 to 450 dollars, sometimes - even more.  Of course, I will look for more options, as now, not everything suits me.  The biggest plus is close to work.  I did not find this apartment myself.  I had to pay a real estate professional.  I admit, it was lazy and I paid for it in full.  Now I will draw conclusions.  I am not a great adviser on these issues, but I can give some tips: <br><br><ul><li>  If you use the services of agencies, pay only "after the fact."  No prepayments.  Not only is it illogical, they can quit. </li><li>  Look for an apartment close to work (captain obvious).  My little experience suggests that prices are high and on the outskirts.  Although it may be a seasonal phenomenon. </li><li>  Even if you rented an apartment in a different area and are not close to work, you still are unlikely to get to work for more than an hour.  The city by the already known standards is small, spacious and compact. </li></ul><br><br><h5>  People who rent apartments </h5><br>  Separate type of people.  About other people - a separate section "People".  This is my first experience in renting an apartment, so perhaps these people are everywhere.  Yes, do not ban me for what I write, but it's true.  When searching for an apartment, you will hear enough about how badly these people live, that someone has a sick mother, or ‚Äúthey have deceived my son with a lot of money, and now we have to do nothing and rent an apartment for this lot of money, throw off the price we cannot even taking into account that there is no washing machine ... ‚Äù.  Since the immunity to such things has not yet formed - it was not very pleasant.  Well, of course talk "and how are you there?  what is happening in the world ... ".  Something like this. <br><br><h4>  Work searches </h4><br>  There is a lot of work here.  Not all of it, of course, is good and suitable for you.  In general, as everywhere else.  I cannot say how many companies are in Minsk or at least to direct - dozens, hundreds or thousands.  I received the offer on the second day of my stay, but decided to look for more.  Gave myself time - two weeks.  A lot of interviews were completed.  There were very sad options, there were options that seemed to me very suitable for my subjective parameters.  In general, everything is as it should be when searching.  As a result, got a job in a small company.  At this stage, official employment is important for me, rather than finding the ideal job, although, of course, I don‚Äôt want to go anywhere, and it‚Äôs good that there is a choice.  Maybe I wanted to find something too suitable in a short time.  In the end, if there is no mutual interest in the future - no one holds anyone. <br><br><h4>  Documents </h4><br>  The ideal version is: <br>  Entering Belarus, you have already decided on a place of work (you have an offer, there is a special permit for work) and with a place of residence.  If not, the steps are as follows: <br><br>  Removal of housing with the obligatory conclusion of a contract of employment with the landlord in the housing and utilities infrastructure of the area for a period of one year. <br>  Necessary clarification on the terms of this contract: <br><br>  - You can be a Ukrainian in Belarus without registration for 30 days; <br>  - The contract of renting an apartment for 1 year makes it possible to obtain registration for <u>temporary residence</u> for 1 year subject to the availability of relevant documents (see below). <br><br>  Documents required for obtaining registration for a <u>temporary stay</u> for a period of 3 months: <br><br>  - The contract of renting housing with the landlord; <br>  - Passport and migration card; <br>  - Application for registration of <u>temporary residence</u> (previously taken from the inspector without a queue and filled); <br>  - Receipt of payment of state duty in the bank (0.5 base value). <br><br>  Registration for a <u>temporary stay</u> for a period of 3 months is made out on the same day at the Citizenship and Migration Department of the district where the contract for renting an apartment is issued. <br><br>  Documents required for obtaining registration for <u>temporary residence</u> for a period of 1 year. <br>  - passport + copy of the passport; <br>  - A copy of the contract for renting an apartment for a period of 1 year; <br>  - special permission to engage in employment + copy.  Done and paid by the organization that takes you to work.  Registration time - 2 weeks; <br>  - labor contract + copy.  It is done after receiving a special permit for work within 1-2 weeks; <br>  - petition of the organization that takes you to work; <br>  - A copy of the registration for a <u>temporary stay</u> (if you did not have time to collect all these documents within 30 days); <br>  - application for registration for <u>temporary residence</u> , taken from the inspector; <br>  - payment receipt (3 basic values). <br><br>  Registration for <u>temporary residence</u> for 1 year - 2 weeks. <br><br>  PS There may be some discrepancies and inaccuracies.  Some nuances may vary, something may just change. <br><br><h4>  Leisure </h4><br>  There are many concerts (Muscovites and Kiev can hardly be surprised).  Literally during my short stay, I came across such names as Tricky, Lenny Kravitz, One republic, Morcheeba, Blue Foundation.  If Incubus or Porcupine Tree arrives, I will probably live here. <br>  In theaters and clubs have not yet gone.  I didn‚Äôt have time for theaters, but not clubs for clubs.  But I think this is all right here. <br>  Given the cleanliness (of course, there are places where this word is not applicable, but there are definitely less such places than in Kiev), it's nice to just walk at any time of the day, take a tour of the city or outside the city through castles, for example.  Who is interested, will surely find what he likes. <br><br><h4>  Prices </h4><br>  In general, life is not cheap.  As for the products - it is worth using the markets.  Cheaper than in stores, the choice is more.  About the rest is written in the relevant sections. <br><br><h4>  People </h4><br>  To form the most complete impression, you need to live here, chat, make friends.  In the meantime, I will say that in the eyes of people completely different moods. <br><br><h4>  Transport </h4><br>  I don‚Äôt have the right machine yet. <br>  In the subway, only two branches.  In some parts of the city to get there only will not work.  Fortunately, there are all representatives of modern transport - trams, trolley buses, buses and minibuses.  I have not yet seen dilapidated trams in Kiev.  For Muscovites - transport is cheaper.  For Kiev - more.  So that the article remains relevant as long as possible, the prices will be in dollars.  Travel on any transport, except for minibuses, costs 0.4 USD (At the driver - 0.45. I didn‚Äôt ask the machinist. If you want to experiment, write in the comments).  Forgive me Ukraine, but now I will not write how much is hryvnia.  I have not used it yet, as there was no need.  Price - 1 USD.  Taxi is generally more expensive than I used to.  From what is very annoying, when you call to order a car, they listen to you and say ‚Äúwait a minute‚Äù, and just a minute, and they call the brand, the color of the car, how long it will be and what the driver‚Äôs name is.  They say quickly, you have to strain and keep in mind.  Test of attentiveness.  No message on the phone, no other confirmation is not (perhaps this is not always the case). <br><br><h4>  Summary </h4><br>  Much is said in the article, the link to which is given at the beginning of the topic.  From myself I would add that in general - it is good, cozy and comfortable to work here.  Naturally, for adequate payment.  Living for a visitor depends on housing conditions, level of salary and other factors.  It is difficult to say to live to a native Minsk dweller, since much has apparently changed lately.  And prices, and standard of living and much more.  It seems to me that living on an average salary of $ 400 is unpleasant.  But many live.  Just like in Ukraine.  And the numbers can be less, sometimes even less. <br><br>  If there are willing to highlight these issues - it would be great.  But maybe it will not have to do with IT. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285670/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285670/</a></p>
