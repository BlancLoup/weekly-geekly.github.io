At some point, the <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/filegivercom/" class="user_link">FilegiverCom</a> article about <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/227477/"><b>Myo</b></a> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/filegivercom/" class="user_link">came across</a> to me.  Before that, I had already heard about this thing, but at that moment I somehow did not betray this meaning, but here she became interested in me.  And not only me!  After reading the article and my colleagues, too, we had a heated discussion about how this device can be used in everyday life.  Not having come to some kind of agreement, we decided that we should touch it personally, and I placed an order. <br>  Until October, there were no changes, except for receiving mailings with the latest company news.  And <b>on</b> October <b>24</b> (almost exactly in four months) I received a text message from the bank about the withdrawal of funds, after which my wait was delayed. <br>  I checked the mailbox every day, but the cherished check in it was never there.  In early December, writing in support with the question: ‚Äú <i>Where exactly is it?</i>  "- I received the answer that the device was sent, we can not give you a tracker, but usually it comes to six weeks.  And I waited on. <br>  And so, on my way back home <b>on the 18th</b> , I almost no longer hoped for anything, looked into the drawer and found a notice there.  My joy knew no bounds, but I could get to the post office only on Saturday.  On Friday, I announced the news to my colleagues and, what was my surprise when one of them showed me <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/243167/">this</a> article. <br>  In any case, on Saturday I got to the post office, took the device and, having tinker with it for a while, decided to tell you about the impressions. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Unpacking </h4><br>  The box itself with the device is quite compact and looks like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/203/25b/a47/20325ba479bb4778b9a7c35c02f6f214.jpg"><br>  Inside is: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6a9/839/43d/6a983943d0734ff7b1ba9b83b67e4f66.jpg"><br><ol><li>  Device itself </li><li>  <b>Bluetooth</b> adapter ( <a href="https://developer.thalmic.com/forums/topic/1623/">does not connect to the built-in 4.0 laptop</a> ) </li><li>  <b>USB-micro</b> <b>cable</b> - <b>USB</b> , for charging and primary connection </li><li>  Clamps for resizing </li><li>  Thank you card </li></ol><br>  The first putting on the arm caused some difficulties, because even the device, which was slightly inflated by my hand, went with a good fit, and its elastic characteristics were not known to me yet: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2d0/9b5/256/2d09b52569dd4565923708c0e9c3a644.jpg"><br>  By the way, after half an hour of use, decent traces remain on the arm, which suggests that <b>Myo</b> can only be used for some specific tasks, and not worn as a fitness tracker, removing only for recharging. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ea5/845/70f/ea584570fc874421a89fbb6456772b3a.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Connection </h4><br>  Go to the site <a href="http://myo.com/start">http://myo.com/start</a> and download applications for your platform. <br>  I decided to connect <b>Myo</b> before installing it, because it was interesting how <b>Windows</b> recognizes it.  He recognized it like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0be/809/383/0be809383f134b5e8e1d284e2bd381eb.png"><br>  After launching the application and connecting to another <b>USB port of the</b> adapter, the device was not persistently recognized until I changed the adapter and its places (that is, I just had to plug the device into another port, but I only have two on my laptop). <br>  Next, the setting is done by the master. <br>  Connecting to the <b>Android-</b> smartphone was no problem, the only thing - first, the device must be disconnected from the previous device (do not untie it!). <br><br><h4>  Using </h4><br>  At first I tried to use <b>Myo</b> to control the <b>VLC</b> player.  In principle, everything was not bad, but for some reason switching the songs did not work.  Experiencedly achieved that he was able to shift the position in the current composition forward or backward (the team should be quick, not long), which suggests that the teams have changed in the new version of the player. <br>  For the smartphone installed <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.autom8ed.androidcontrol%26hl%3Dru">this</a> application.  With the management of <b>Google Music,</b> it coped well, but its sensitivity to the teams is too high. <br>  By the way, about the teams.  In standby mode, <b>Myo</b> listens to only one: double-tap with your middle finger over a large finger, after which it goes into control mode.  Actually, there are only four teams: <br><ol><li>  Spread your fingers </li><li>  Take your hand away from you </li><li>  Take your hand to yourself </li><li>  Squeeze fist </li></ol><br>  <b>Myo is also</b> well-versed in space.  This is used, for example, in the ‚Äú <i>Fist</i> ‚Äù command: by turning the hand clockwise / counterclockwise, you can increase / decrease the volume in the same <b>VLC</b> .

    <h4>  Development </h4><br>  Being a developer, of course, I could not pass by in order not to do any software myself.  Having rummaged on <a href="https://developer.thalmic.com/">https://developer.thalmic.com</a> , I found out that it is possible not only to develop my applications using the <b>SDK</b> , but also to implement the management of already existing <b>Myo Script</b> tools. <br>  <b>The SDK is</b> supplied only for <b>C ++</b> , and, as an avid <b>.Net</b> developer, I was already going to write my own wrapper, but, having searched, I found two already existing ones.  One did not start with me, c, everything flew normally, which is not surprising. <br>  There is an <b>SDK</b> for <b>Android</b> too, but I haven‚Äôt felt it yet. <br>  But!  Once again I want to note that wearing <b>Myo</b> around the clock will be very problematic.  Therefore, the development of a computer control program, by analogy with the programs that control it from the console, does not make any sense.  The software should be either very specific, or extremely necessary, so that the user is not lazy to put on and take off the device every time.  I have a few ideas for <b>Android</b> , and a little less for <b>Windows</b> , but that's another story ... <br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br>  As expected - the gadget is extremely interesting.  Recognition of gestures in <b>95% of</b> cases is true.  Great prospects have a bunch of <b>Myo</b> - a smartphone.  This is both fitness and serious sport.  The device can also be extremely useful for drivers, especially two-wheeled vehicles.  In any case, this is the future that only a few years ago we were drawn to us only by directors of science fiction films and it seems that it has come ... <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/364865/">https://habr.com/ru/post/364865/</a></p>
