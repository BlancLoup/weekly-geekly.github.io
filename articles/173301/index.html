      I went to the AppStore and then it started ... <br>  And the first thing that answered me about ssh was the issh program (popular and free) <br><h6>  Issh </h6><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/881/5aa/b79/8815aab79e98e6cca40144a5269644e9.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Most of the people met her (and maybe used / enjoyed).  Everyone knows what ssh is, and I think you can immediately move on to its merits: <br><ul><li>  storage of any number of configured connections </li><li>  RSA / DSA key support </li><li>  ctrl, alt, esc, tab, shift, and Fn - for convenience rendered separately </li><li>  connection ports </li><li>  RDP (Windows Remote Desktop) support </li><li>  Custom themes </li><li>  Connection import via Dropbox / iCloud / etc ( <u>in development</u> ) </li></ul><br><br>  Everything installed now needs to be connected, and then a new one appears, not a problem, but a discrepancy - I don‚Äôt remember the ip-address of the laptop (and how, we remember, it‚Äôs impossible to get up). <br>  And comes to the rescue <br><br><h6>  IP Scanner </h6><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/601/a43/d6c/601a43d6c42d3094426a15547c7c40eb.png" alt="image"><br>  This program automatically scans your WLAN and immediately displays all those sitting next to you (even if it is with a patch cord). <br><img src="http://playstoreapps.org/images/ip_network_scanner_v27_2.jpg" alt="image"><br>  In particular, this program can specify the fact that all the saved devices to assign a description and pictures (well, this is for very large networks.) <br>  You can download it in the AppStore (there is a paid and free version). <br><br>  It seems to say everything the mission is accomplished, but it was not there that the connection with the router was lost ( <s>well, I think everything came, sailed</s> ). <br>  Rather, there is a signal, well, very weak.  We are looking for a problem, and this will help us. <br><br><h6>  WIFI Analyzer </h6><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/842/154/b1f/842154b1fe6cc03fc2ece39890048327.jpg" alt="image"><br>  This program came to me immediately with the advent of Cydia, and more than once helped. <br>  Its features are that it sees all networks on the air (even with a weak signal), shows who broadcasts on which channel, has a signal graph with points of maximum and minimum signal levels, and also shows the router manufacturer (which is convenient for KulHackers who decided act on the scheme using <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/172799/">here</a> ) <br>  I found it only in Cydia (rep: http: //cydia.xsellizer.com/), I advise a handy thing. <br><img src="http://softiphone.ru/uploads/posts/2012-03/1332871121_a0875ffb5f6c2a3d129be3f254f7e28b.jpg" alt="image"><br>  So I forgot to say what the problem was.  It turned out that my neighbor was too smart with his router (I still didn‚Äôt understand how) and took all four channels where mine worked (after a while everything worked out). <br>  And calmly connecting to the laptop (I did not see anything useful for myself), sent it to shutdown. <br><br>  But here it was necessary to urgently connect to another computer and find out why vkontakte does not work and the story continues. <br><br><h6>  iNetTools </h6><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f06/78d/b84/f0678db847c7b1efc12fd0bb7b71bb74.jpg" alt="image"><br>  This program has a set of 4 useful utilities (2 of which are available on any computer) <br>  These are ping, trace, DNS lookup and scanport. <br>  About them, too, everyone and everyone knows for a long time (an explanation will be required only for completely green users) <br>  The main advantage of the program is that the program saves and reproduces all actions and results at the request of the user. <br>  For scanning, you specify the ports yourself (supports all standard ones) and wait for the result (it takes ~ 5 minutes for me). <br>  You can download it from the AppStore. <br>  Necessary ports were closed, and then I had to get up ((( <br>  The problem was avaste and mozila firefox ( <s>if I have free time I will write about it</s> ) <br>  PS: If you know worthy replacements, write in the comments. <br>  PSS: If something goes wrong, we will correct it (I do not want to repeat the story as with the first post) <br><habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/173301/">https://habr.com/ru/post/173301/</a></p>
