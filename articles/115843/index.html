  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How I returned $ 530</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day to all.  I look, on Habr√© there are few questions on the return of money in the case of ‚Äúkicker‚Äù by the seller or some other cases.  I will try to fix it by my own example.  In general, about everything in order. <br><br>  This story happened to me back in the autumn of 2010.  Just on the store shelves appeared all such a Samsung Galaxy S i9000.  Its price did not suit me at all, and then suddenly a friend who had long been familiar with the ebay auction ordered a lot, from unnecessary trinkets to expensive electronics, and never had any problems with sellers and the receipt of goods.  It was through him that this device was ordered by another our mutual friend.  And I succumbed to his persuasion to purchase Galaxy on ebay.  And this was my first purchase ... <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  All questions related to finding the right machine at the auction, lay on my shoulders.  Yes, I did not mind.  Searched long and carefully.  That price did not suit, it did not deliver to Russia.  It was not possible to order through the seller from whom this device was purchased by my friend, since he had no more of them at that price.  And I was looking for around 16,500 rubles.

      And here is happiness.  The seller from America, with a great track record (99.4%) sells the Galaxy S for the $ 530 I need - and this is delivered to Russia.  Without thinking twice, I am writing to a friend, he presses "Buy it now", and that's it.  It remains to pay.  Prod asks when the payment will come, and I already replenish my friend's account.  And here is the first problem.  The seller cancels the transaction (money has not yet been deposited in his account).  A friend writes that he will pay tomorrow, don‚Äôt be in such a hurry (nothing was said about the immediate payment in the product description).  Seller agrees. <br><br>  The next day, via paypal $ 530 goes to his account.  He says thank you and after a day attaches the track.  It would seem that everything, it remains only to wait.  I had no doubts about this, as his Galaxy S came well to one friend, and the one through whom he ordered also had his Iphone, and others didn‚Äôt have any problems in my environment.  The track is not being tracked yet, but it happens with the USPS. <br><br>  The next day, the product starts to track.  And here is the second problem, instead of the promised PRIORITY MAIL - FIRST-CLASS, which means that we cannot see it further than America.  I am an amateur, and the track of the form LJ ********* US did not bother me.  Friend, which is strange, for some reason, too.  But they wrote to the seller, he said that he was mistaken, nothing terrible, will come.  Well come, so come.  The main thing is that my smart comes in integrity and security. <br><br>  The days lasted a long and tiring.  On the USPS there was information that the parcel arrived at the US mail and seemed to be sent from there.  After 25 days, a friend comes to me with a request to receive 5 parcels in arrivals for him (I forgot to say that I ordered some other cosmetics through him to my girlfriend, and now she‚Äôs come, according to the track).  He gave me his passport, filled out the papers, and he got away on business.  I came to the post office, received the parcels, checked the integrity of the packages, everything turned out to be in order, signed for receipt, and just at that time a friend finished his business. <br><br>  I handed him the package.  He identified that with cosmetics, he immediately identified it, he gave it, he identified 3 more, but the fifth one could not.  Looks, USA, easy something, thought that the t-shirt came.  And left.  After 40 minutes, as soon as he reached the house and opened the envelopes, he called me. <br><br>  ‚ÄúHello, your phone came in that fifth package,‚Äù a friend said to me.  How glad I was.  - But the phone is not there, instead of them folded sheets of white paper. <br>  - A4?  - I ask sadly and perplexedly. <br>  - Yeah. <br>  - And what shall we do? <br>  - What-what, write to the seller, draw up a complaint and return the money. <br>  - OK. <br><br>  Then I began to smoke the ebay-forum to the question of how best to present this to ebay-evtsam, because I didn‚Äôt want to lose money, but about such cases there very often.  Everywhere they wrote that it is best to say that the goods did not come (especially this is first-class and it is not monitored outside the US), because there are very few chances to win on the subject of the product‚Äôs inconsistency with reality.  I advised a friend, but he was an honest person, he valued his reputation on ebay and did not agree with me.  I described my problem on the ebay-forum, but nothing new was expressed on my problem. <br><br>  Wrote to the seller.  That silent.  They wrote in the support of Ibeya, saying that the goods do not correspond to reality, instead of the phone there is white paper.  Who of my friends found out about it - they laughed, asked why he didn‚Äôt write something like ‚Äúrussian loser‚Äù on paper.  But I was not laughing.  The seller on the contact did not go exactly 6 days.  The problem was hanging in the air, we already thought that it would be possible to solve everything without it (as ebay decides), but it was not there ... <br><br>  By the way, at the time of the dispute in the feedback of the seller, there was a complaint about the white paper instead of the iPhone for 750 bucks.  This gave confidence that ebay will resolve the issue correctly.  Seller after the appearance immediately began to excuse.  I also smoked his questionnaire more carefully and saw that he was not an American at all, but an Armenian, and even spoke Russian.  We started personal correspondence with him in Russian.  Ebay asked to provide the seller with photos of the goods that came (they, by the way, did not show them - they did not ask).  Photographs from different angles of paper sheets sent.  The seller does not agree to any.  Yes, and found on the ebay-forum about a complaint, said to attach to the case.  Ebay says, they say, wait for the decision.  We are waiting for another 5 days. <br><br>  And ebay makes a demand to send the goods back to the seller.  Be sure to track.  And after that, the amount spent will be fully refunded (except for the amount that was left for delivery back from Russia to America).  By the way, in order to find in the city a mail that deals with international shipments, I had to go through 3 departments (the one I took the goods, sent them to the main office, mainly the specialized ones - thanks to the ‚ÄúRussian Post‚Äù).  I filled out the paper, sent it, attached it to the case track and waited for the return. <br><br>  After 3 days, a return message arrives at paypal.  For the amount spent on shipment from Russia - $ 10 bonus coupon.  And from the seller of an apology, they say "do not be offended, please, just need it."  The proposal to leave my friend positive feedback prod cursed (just a friend wrote him ‚Äúfucking cheater‚Äù, for which he received a warning from ebay).  And after 2 days the money returned was returned to the card. <br><br>  By this time, I had already got myself an international card, I registered for paypal and ebay, I found a seller with 100% positive reviews from England and with my smartphone for $ 550.  This unit came without problems in 3 weeks and never ceases to please me.  After that I ordered a lot of things, but I had no problems with anything (like a friend, from knick-knacks and clothes to electronics). <br><br>  So do not hesitate to order from abroad, there is, in fact, very, very profitable to shop.  And there are many interesting and unusual things that you will not find in Russia.  And all problems are solved, basically, in favor of the deceived buyer.  I just want to remind you once again: carefully look at the seller‚Äôs questionnaire, read feedback (for example, I didn‚Äôt deal with phones and generally didn‚Äôt do such big sales) and read the product description. <br><br>  As Habrayuser <a href="https://habr.com/users/romandry/" class="user_link">Romandry</a> noted in comments, <i>‚ÄúIt is also advisable to open the package upon receipt ‚Äî then there are more chances of fraudulently obtaining an act in the mail or in the office of the transport company.‚Äù</i> <br><br>  And be honest to the seller and support. <br><br>  Sorry for the time spent, I hope someone my story will be useful.  Thanks for attention.  Enjoy the shopping! <br><br>  PS photos of the envelope with the paper is not preserved, I can not attach.  And the seller, and to this day sells on ebay, but the phone is no longer engaged. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/115843/">https://habr.com/ru/post/115843/</a></p>
