And in some areas there is quite imputed evidence base.  At the same time, in most cases, explanations of this very efficiency are conducted through constructions adopted within the framework of this approach and are not quoted anywhere outside this framework. <br><br>  For example, <i>logotherapists</i> believe that they achieve positive results by helping the patient find the meaning of life [11], supporters of the <i>cognitive approach</i> - by working with negative automatic thoughts [12], representatives of the <i>psychodynamic</i> direction - by working with the transference, drives and object relations [13], supporters of the <i>psychedelic</i> approach - due to the work with perinatal matrices and systems of condensed experience [14] and so on. <br><br>  At the same time, the majority of such explanations lose all persuasiveness as soon as they fall outside the context of the theory that generated them.  So, for example, the cognitive postulate that thoughts affect emotions [12] is completely unacceptable within the psychodynamic school, where a completely opposite view is used. <br><br>  Contrary to the opinion prevailing in the domestic environment, proven clinical effectiveness ( <i>to the extent that it complies with the principles of <a href="http://encyclopatia.ru/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0">evidence-based medicine</a> that is generally possible for psychotherapy</i> ), it has not only cognitive-behavioral, but also, for example, psychodynamic therapy [15,16,17].  Those.  Different therapies based on completely different sets of axioms show comparable effectiveness. <br><br>  Modern authors note [10, p. 7190] that all approaches to psychotherapy have a common base that ensures efficiency: <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúThe relationship between therapist and client, in which different roles have a different set of expectations and responsibilities;  impartial and unconditional acceptance of the client by the therapist;  a union whose goal is to work on common goals. ‚Äù </blockquote>  However, these categories are too ‚Äú <i>hypothetical</i> ‚Äù and ‚Äú <i>psychological</i> ‚Äù (and therefore <i>poorly formalized</i> ) to be satisfied with them as an explanation of the effectiveness of ‚Äútherapeutic conversations‚Äù. <br><br>  One of the most interesting attempts to isolate and describe quantitatively the universal basis of successful therapy is the study of German authors [18], in which it was found that the predictor of the success of therapy is the difference in emotions that appear on the therapist‚Äôs face and those expressed by the client during the narration. <br><br>  In other words, if during a first session a client with a sad face speaks about his pain (expressing " <i>negative emotion</i> "), and the therapist listens to him, showing interest and satisfaction (" <i>positive emotion</i> "), then the therapy is likely to be successful.  If both express emotions of the same direction ("positive" / "negative"), then no. <br><br>  The authors rather well formalized the testing procedure, having compiled a very limited ‚Äúvocabulary‚Äù of emotions and selecting only those facial expressions that corresponded exactly to it.  With regard to determining the success of therapy (also not the easiest task), estimates of the therapist, patient, and objective indicators of symptom reduction were used. <br><br>  Their conclusions are quite different from the predictions and explanations that psychotherapists themselves give ‚Äî they talk about anything: about motivational readiness, about the radical of the client‚Äôs personality, about the level of organization of that person, about the deep patterns ‚Äî but not about the emotions that they express with their faces. <br><br>  Such studies make us somewhat skeptical about the supposed mechanisms for realizing beneficial changes that psychotherapists / psychologists are talking about, and are pushing to find some more convincing ways to explain the existence of these very changes. <br><br><h2>  Therapy and brain changes </h2><br>  Some time ago, there was no way to objectively evaluate the effect of therapy on the brain, so psychotherapists made the most courageous (and often incorrect) assumptions about the presence and nature of such an effect. <br><br>  Naturally, this situation could not last forever, and as soon as researchers had available methods for imaging the brain ( <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE-%25D1%258D%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2584%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">PET</a> , <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE-%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2584%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">MRI</a> , <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A4%25D1%2583%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BA%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE-%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2584%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">fMRI</a> , <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259E%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2584%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%258D%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BF%25D1%258C%25D1%258E%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2584%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">SPECT</a> ), studies were published that aimed to determine the extent of the impact (or lack thereof) of conversational therapy on the physiological substrate of the brain . <br><br>  Identifying this influence would solve several important problems - from proving that conversational therapy <i>works at all</i> , to understanding how it works, whether there is a difference between different types of therapy, etc. <br><br>  Below is my attempt to systematize the data on the visualization of changes caused in the brain by speaking therapy. <br><br>  It does not claim to be universal, but when it was created, I tried to include more or less sane studies and recheck the conclusions of the authors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/r-/am/na/r-amna9gkw1_y_nujq1cvhhe518.png"><br>  <i><b>Fig.</b></i>  <i><b>4</b></i>  <i>The effect of speaking therapy on the brain.</i>  <i>Sources: [10, 32, 33, 34].</i>  <i>The table <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yb366b42">is available in Google Docs</a> .</i> <br><br>  What do we see in this table?  <b>The first</b> thing that catches your eye is the fact that the same areas of the brain (for example, the caudate nucleus or the amygdala) are affected by completely different types of therapy. <br><br>  <b>The second</b> is that in some studies the activity of certain areas increases (for example, the amygdala in the Ritchey study), and in others, with the same therapy, it decreases (the limbic system, including the amygdala, in the study of Goldapple). <br><br>  <b>The third</b> is that some studies are marked in gray.  These are those whose design caused me the greatest doubts.  But since there are not so many such studies today, I included them here. <br><br>  What is the result?  Visible some inconsistency data.  It is caused by the fact that, firstly, the brain is a complex and controversial thing (I seem to have already spoken about this), and, secondly, by the fact that the research did not have a completely identical methodology. <br><br>  What is the value of this table, if you can not directly compare different methods of PT?  It is possible to make sure that conversational therapy ‚Äú <i>does something with the brain there</i> ‚Äù, and also that you can try to build some cautious guesses about how this conversational therapy works. <br><br>  But first, let's try to still highlight some patterns in these changes.  To do this, we will not peer into the table for a long time, but use the data from the finished meta-analyzes. <br><br><h2>  Assumptions regarding the effect of conversational therapy </h2><br>  It is assumed that during depression, <b>CPT</b> enhances <a href="https://psychology_dictionary.academic.ru/3654/%25D0%259A%25D0%259E%25D0%25A0%25D0%25A2%25D0%2598%25D0%259A%25D0%2590%25D0%259B%25D0%25AC%25D0%259D%25D0%25AB%25D0%2599">cortical control</a> from the prefrontal cortex (especially its dorsolateral part), which inhibits (inhibits) impulses of subcortical structures [32, p. 6]. <br><br>  What does this mean: impulses that rise ‚Äú <i>from the depths of the unconscious</i> ‚Äù (this is just a beautiful metaphor) begin to be better controlled by structures that are more related to rational thinking. <br><br>  If we recall how <a href="https://habr.com/post/370295/">KPT</a> works - namely, it tries to replace ‚Äú <i>automatic thoughts filled with cognitive distortions with more sober and rationalistic assessments of the situation</i> ‚Äù, then we can trace some logic in this whole thing. <br><br>  <b>Therapy aimed at activating behavior</b> presumably leads to the activation of the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE">striatum</a> and the activation of the reward system, including the regions of the dorsolateral prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex [32, p. 6] <br><br>  What does this mean: again, the activation of ‚Äú <i>more conscious structures</i> ‚Äù, as well as structures responsible for behavior (as a set of motor, ie, physical actions). <br><br>  It is logical: we activated the behavior, activated the structures that are responsible for it.  Since this therapy is essentially behaviorism, it is not surprising that the structures responsible are inclusive, incl.  for reflexes and analysis of encouragement / punishment. <br><br>  Overcoming repressed emotions and weakening unconscious guilt, which are important components of <b>psychodynamic therapy</b> , are presumably associated with a decrease in the activity of the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex [32, p. 6]. <br><br>  Everything is quite interesting here, since this very subgenual PPK is involved, including  in overcoming feelings of fear (here you can draw far-reaching conclusions that, perhaps, psychodynamics are right, and the repressed guilt is therefore supplanted, because the psyche is ‚Äúafraid‚Äù to accept it, but this will lead us away to speculations). <br><br>  It should be noted that these assumptions appeared not from scratch, but on the basis of other studies (there are links in [32] on the corresponding pages). <br><br><h2>  Little about the brain </h2><br>  Before discussing the results of research on the effects of conversational therapy on the brain, you need to at least talk a little about how it works, and consider some of its components that are directly related to the subject of the article, in order to understand what the researchers have been doing there. <br><br>  The main thing that can be said about the brain: <b>it is complex</b> .

That is why all phrases like (‚Äú <i>amygdala is responsible for fear reactions</i> ‚Äù should be perceived as more or less successful analogies / metaphors, nothing more). <br><br>  However, to some extent its components are specialized, and we will try to consider this specialization in the context we are interested in. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ys/ig/kg/ysigkgc0stgnzewev4x5az2qkso.png"><br>  <i><b>Fig.</b></i>  <i><b>6</b></i>  <i>Some components of the brain relevant to the subject of this article [31, p. 126].</i> <br><br><h3>  Amygdala </h3><br>  The amygdala, it is also the "almond-shaped body."

First, data comes from the senses to the <b>thalamus</b> , then they follow one of two independent paths: either directly to the amygdala, or first pass through the <b>prefrontal cortex</b> , and then reach the amygdala through the <b>anterior cingulate cortex</b> [22, p. 19]: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dc/4d/10/dc4d1065bvvq1h-q_jagcyrr1my.png"><br>  <i><b>Fig.</b></i>  <i><b>8</b></i>  <i>Two modes of activation of the tonsils.</i> <br><br>  The first path is ‚Äú <i>quick and dirty</i> ‚Äù - the amygdala receives information about what kind of tin is created in the outside world, and does not go into details of what exactly this stimulus was: it starts to act, without taking the time to figure out in a situation. <br><br>  The second way is slower, but involves some analysis of incoming information.  The data is processed in the <b>prefrontal cortex</b> , which integrates sensory information from the senses with information about the context of this stimulus received from the hippocampus, compares it with the experience stored in long-term memory, analyzes the previous similar situations and decides how real the danger is.  She sends this decision to the amygdala, which, in the case of a positive response, triggers the preparation of the body for the ‚Äúflight or attack‚Äù reaction. <br><br>  If the cortex " <i>recognized the stimulus as harmless,</i> " the amygdala, on the contrary, inhibits the stress response [22, p. 19]. <br><br>  For example, if an unprepared person noticed a snake in his path, it is highly likely that his amygdala will be activated by the thalamus without the participation of the cortex.  At the same time, if this is a gerpentologist who understands that the snake is not dangerous, then, quite possibly, his reaction will follow the second scenario. <br><br>  It has been shown [10, p. 7184] that the activity of the amygdala is enhanced in depression and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE">post-traumatic disorders</a> .

Thus, the caudate nucleus can be called the " <i>feedback processor</i> " [31, p. 58] <br><br>  The ability to perform directed actions is something that often suffers from mental illness. <br><br>  The caudate nucleus plays an important role in the processes of learning, speech, and the transmission of information about disturbing events between the thalamus and the orbitofrontal cortex. <br><br>  The increased volume of the caudate nucleus (in comparison with the norm) correlates with impaired spatial working memory [25]. <br><br>  Dysfunction of the caudate nucleus is associated with such phenomena as <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC_%25D0%25A2%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0">Tourette syndrome</a> and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259E%25D0%25B1%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE-%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BF%25D1%2583%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE">obsessive-compulsive disorder</a> [38].  In some cases, it makes sense to reduce its activity (more correctly, to return it under the control of the big hemispheres). <br><br><h3>  Thalamus </h3><br>  <b>The thalamus</b> (part of the diencephalon) is the most important ‚Äúneural hub‚Äù, where almost all sensory signals (except for the sense of smell) switch to the cortex [19, p. 85]. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ml/ha/ig/mlhaigvpvo4jbf7n-zmawg0y9ga.png"><br>  <i><b>Fig.</b></i>  <i><b>10</b></i>  <i>Thalamus</i> <br><br>  The intended function is the reception of information from sensors, its primary processing, input and storage [19, p. 201], transfer to the cortex.  In some cases, the thalamus increases the activity of the cortex, in others - it blocks it [19, p. 122] <br><br>  The fact that olfactory signals bypass the thalamus allows adherents of perfumery and aromatherapy to talk about the importance of their activities with some degree of validity (they say smells can influence the emotional sphere). <br><br>  Studies on monkeys have shown that the thalamus is associated with compulsive behavior and signs of anxiety [26].  It is believed that the behavior aimed at checking and re-checking, as well as continuous cleaning, is ‚Äú <i>sewn</i> ‚Äù into the thalamus [27]. <br><br>  Together with the temporal lobes, the thalamus inhibits excessive mood swings that occur in response to complex daily stimuli [10, p. 7185]. <br><br>  The thalamus is a central component for integrating memories of perceptual, somatosensory and cognitive processes [42]. <br><br>  In addition, the thalamus plays an important role in modulating the activity of the amygdala (see above). <br><br><h3>  Hippocampus </h3><br>  <b>The hippocampus</b> , like the <b>amygdala</b> , is located inside each of the temporal lobes of the brain [19, p. 211]. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0t/po/hn/0tpohn5f8umnkifoigrrxadgy0s.png"><br>  <i><b>Fig.</b></i>  <i><b>11</b></i>  <i>Hippocampus.</i> <br><br>  It plays an important role in the transfer of experimental information to long-term memory, as well as in the extraction of episodic memories, and is related to spatial orientation [19, p. 213]. <br><br>  Studies show that the hippocampus is an important component of the mechanism of consciousness [28].  Hippocampus is one of the few brain structures in which neurogenesis is possible (production of new neurons during life) [19, p. 216] <br><br>  Together with the amygdala and the limbic cortex, the hippocampus forms the <b>limbic system</b> [19, p. 231].  These structures are closely related to the work of short-term memory (that is, the memory of experience under the control of consciousness) [19, p. 232]. <br><br>  Other studies show that the hippocampus is involved in unconscious memory processes, and that they (conscious and unconscious processes) are interconnected [29] In addition, the hippocampus plays an important role in the processes of spatial imagination, memory formation and access to it [31, p. 65] <br><br>  The hippocampus (more precisely, its dysfunction) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of such mental diseases as schizophrenia, autism, and depression [10, p. 227]. <br><br><h3>  Anterior cingulate cortex </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qw/dr/s_/qwdrs_-nb2hstmn0cpcxtm6dllm.png"><br>  <i><b>Fig.</b></i>  <i><b>12</b></i>  <i>Anterior cingulate cortex.</i> <br><br>  <b>The anterior cingulate cortex</b> performs various functions, of which the most interesting for us are [10, p. 7183]: the conscious regulation of emotions through the re-examination of negative emotions, the suppression of excessive arousal and the suppression of the amygdala. <br><br>  Those.  when we understand that we are ‚Äú <i>pounding</i> ‚Äù in our fears, and we can consciously abandon them, we must say thanks to our anterior cingulate cortex. <br><br><h3>  Prefrontal cortex </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ou/vc/2v/ouvc2vqlsvmuccqh3rf9eckaslq.png"><br>  <i><b>Fig.</b></i>  <i><b>13</b></i>  <i>Prefrontal cortex.</i> <br><br>  <b>The prefrontal areas of the cortex</b> perform an important control function in the brain.  These structures are necessary for arbitrary control.  In addition, they participate in emotions and restrain involuntary impulsive reactions [19, p. 93].  Prefrontal cortex involved in the decision-making process related to moral issues [31, p. 7], <br><br>  Human conscious feelings arise when the signals of the limbic system reach areas of the prefrontal cortex that support consciousness [31, p. 39]. <br><br>  The prefrontal cortex is the substrate for the main functions of the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AD%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE">ego</a> [10, p. 7184], together with the amygdala, it controls an essential part of a person‚Äôs emotional life and provides adaptability.  Disruption of this ligament can cause very acute emotional pain and cloud human prudence. <br><br>            (..     ,   ‚Äú <i></i> ‚Äù    ‚Äî  )    ,         ‚Äî  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F"></a>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AD%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F"></a> .       <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D1%258A%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D1%2585_%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2588%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9"> </a> [10, . 7184]. <br><br>    ,    [10, . 7184]    ,      ,      , ,       ,  ¬´ ¬ª ( ,         ). <br><br>      ,  ,   ..  ,        ( ) .       .. . <br><br>     ¬´¬ª ,      ,    [31, . 109] <br><br>  (   ,  ,  ‚Äî    )      ,  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2598%25D1%2581%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2584%25D1%2583%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BA%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8">  </a> [10, . 7184]:      , ,  ,     . <br><br>               .[32, . 6] ,              [20, . 115] <br><br><h3>   </h3><br> ,   <b> </b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/b6/d8/pf/b6d8pfqywpftmtw94fy3gokg10o.png"><br>  <i><b>Fig.</b></i> <i><b>14</b> .  .</i> <br><br>    ( ,     )              ( <i> , , </i> ),         [10, . 7186] <br><br>     ,  ,     ,           ,   ,  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2584%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F"></a> ,  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D0%25B1%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC"></a> ,     [10, . 7186]. <br><br>         [39].

But how exactly does he do it? <br><br>  The answer lies in its property as neuroplasticity.  More precisely, not so: there is no direct evidence that psychotherapy increases brain neuroplasticity, but the common place is the idea that this very neuroplasticity is somehow involved in the process of psychotherapy [49]. <br><br>  When applied to the nervous system, neuroplasticity is the ability of nerve elements and regulatory molecules to adaptive reorganization under the influence of endogenous and exogenous influences [46, 79]. <br><br>  Neuroplasticity is observed at different levels [47] - at the level of the brain as a whole, at the level of its individual components, at the level of neurons, and even at the subcellular level. <br><br>  The fundamental component of neuroplasticity is the plasticity of synaptic connections (ie, connections between neurons), which constantly disappear and reappear, and the balance of these opposite processes depends primarily on the activity of neurons [47]. <br><br>  The dependence of synaptic plasticity on activity is one of the central points of the concept of neuroplasticity, as well as theories of learning and memory, based on changes in the structure and function of synapses caused by experience. <br><br>  <b>Long-term plasticity</b> is realized as a result of changes in the expression of genes triggered by signaling cascades, which, in turn, are modulated by various signaling molecules with changes in neural activity. <br><br>  A detailed examination of the molecular mechanisms of neuroplasticity is clearly beyond the scope of this article, so we will focus on the fact that the ability of the brain to change under the influence of external influences is proven.  And it allows you to implement all those changes, which were discussed above. <br><br><h2>  Other factors affecting psychotherapy </h2><br>  Here we will talk about some additional hypotheses about exactly how therapy can affect the brain: <br><br>  1. <b>Psychotherapy may affect</b> neurotransmitter <b>levels</b> , particularly <b>serotonin</b> .  A review [49] showed that patients suffering from <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258F%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25B0%25D1%2584%25D1%2584%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE">bipolar affective disorder</a> and depression and who had lower serotonin levels (compared to the control group) in the prefrontal cortex and thalamus before the start of treatment showed an increase in serotonin levels in these areas after a year‚Äôs course of psychodynamic therapy.  True, the study on the basis of which this conclusion was made is far from an ideal design (small sample, lack of successful reproduction). <br><br>  2. Perhaps <b>therapy affects the thyroid axis</b> .  The same review [49] refers to a study that showed that depressed patients who responded successfully to CPT achieved a decrease in T4 (thyroid hormone) levels, while patients who did not respond to therapy had it boost <br><br>  3. Perhaps psychotherapy <b>stimulates processes related to the neuroplasticity of the brain</b> .  As mentioned above, there is no clear evidence that psychotherapy leads to an increase in brain neuroplasticity, but there is evidence from animals, according to which training leads to it. <br><br>  It is believed [49] that in psychotherapy, <i>learning</i> occurs <i>through research</i> , which leads to an increase in the synaptic potentials of the neurons of the perforator path connecting the entorhinal cortex with the dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation. <br><br>  The same increase was demonstrated in animal models: rats that had undergone spatial orientation training had a greater density of dendritic spines compared with the two control groups. <br><br>  Since the length of the dendrites, as well as the structure of their branching, remained unchanged, conclusions were made about the formation of new synapses. <br><br>  Of course, directly transferring data from animal models to humans, and even taking into account different activities (direct learning in one case and psychotherapy in another) is not entirely correct, but some authors [49] consider it possible to use these data as an argument in the benefit of the hypothesis that psychotherapy changes the brain at the physical level. <br><br><h2>  Practical conclusions </h2><br>  Conversational therapy can lead to significant changes in the brain.  Naturally, not only is she - various mental exercises, meditation, and life experience in general, also use neuroplasticity to form the corresponding connectome. <br><br>  However, studies show that during conversational therapy these changes reach a higher level than in its absence. <br><br>  The question of whether it is possible to use neuroplasticity for self-therapy, I still leave unanswered: the article and so it turned out too long. <br><br><h2>  Video version </h2><br>  And here is the promised video version for those who prefer <s>to listen to all garbage in the background on accelerated playback</s> to watch, not read: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sS1oGVFknxQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Sorry for the quality of the broadcast, it's terrible, I know. <br><br><h2>  Literature </h2><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">References</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <b>1.</b> Recognition of psychotherapy effectiveness: The APA resolution.
