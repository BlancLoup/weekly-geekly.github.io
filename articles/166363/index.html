  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A few words about productivity</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The issue of productivity and responsibility is always in the first place among the requirements for new employees. <br><br>  If you go to any bookstore, you will find a lot of literature on the topic of time management.  In these books there is a description of practices and exercises that will help (or not, how anyone) to learn how to manage their time and priorities.  But if you are too lazy to try different methods, but you really want to work less and have more time to do it, then take a few minutes to read this article, where I will share a few practical tips. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Priority of tasks </h4><br>  No matter how it sounds, but there is one simple rule that will allow in any situation to always get a buzz from work.  It sounds like this: do all the difficult and unpleasant work at the beginning.  ‚ÄúAt the beginning‚Äù can mean the beginning of a working day, week, or month, depending on how difficult the task is. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Suppose you have several tasks that need to be solved today: one is ‚Äúunpleasant‚Äù and three are ‚Äúpleasant‚Äù (the complexity of the tasks in this case is not particularly important, their priority is the same).  The temptation to start with ‚Äúpleasant‚Äù tasks almost always turns into a situation where you, consciously or not, delay the implementation of an ‚Äúunpleasant‚Äù task for you, which will torment you all the time, turning ‚Äúpleasant‚Äù tasks into ‚Äúnot quite pleasant ones‚Äù. <br><br>  The result: the day was spent waiting for something complicated and unpleasant, and at the end of the day this task was accomplished at best (although practice shows that such tasks tend to be delayed for an indefinite period), at worst - deadlines are broken, and the sediment in any case stayed. <br><br><h4>  The main thing is the result, not the process. </h4><br>  In elementary school we were taught that verbs can be perfect and imperfect. <br><br><blockquote>  Verbs of the perfect form indicate the completeness of the action, its result, the end of the action or its beginning.  In an indefinite form, they answer the question ‚Äúwhat to do?‚Äù For example: to reach, to buy, to ring, to build, to sing.  Please note that the verb of the perfect form has only two forms of time: past and future.  Currently absent. <br><br>  Imperfect verbs denote long-term or repetitive actions, without indicating their completeness.  In an indefinite form, they answer the question ‚Äúwhat to do?‚Äù For example: sing, boil, run, dream, reread, bounce.  Imperfect verbs have all three forms of tense: past, present, and future. </blockquote><br>  Why did I remember this?  Probably because all people are divided into two types: those for whom the result is the verb of the perfect form, and those for whom the result is the verb of the imperfect type. <br><br>  If you want to increase your productivity, the process (for example, I do) should not be considered the result.  If you force yourself to report only on the work done, you can expect that the productivity of your work will actually increase. <br><br><h4>  Less distracted </h4><br>  In the world of twitter, facebook, habr and other hostile resources (in terms of productivity) it is very difficult to concentrate on the task.  It is really difficult, but, as they say, you need to force yourself (eh, while writing this article I was distracted by Twitter twice).  It must be remembered that any distraction from the current task takes you from 10 to 20 minutes.  If you have several context switches per day, then you will not have time to do anything, but at the same time you will get very tired. <br><br><h4>  The more interesting the task, the more time to do </h4><br>  It really is.  Therefore, you should try to do only what you really like.  But how to achieve this - you ask - if the head ordered to make a bunch of any useless garbage that nobody needs?  This is a real problem.  You should always see the meaning in your work. <br><br>  If there is no point or you know that nobody will appreciate your work anyway, make it so that it will be formally accepted, and spend the rest of your time on your self-development.  If you do this, then after a while you will be able to do only what you personally will enjoy. <br><br><h4>  Take an example </h4><br>  Even the most diligent employee should receive an incentive from outside.  Therefore, it is highly recommended to watch good movies, listen to good music and read good books and articles.  A good example gives inspiration, it is a huge incentive to create and reap the rewards for their work. <br><br><h4>  Do I need to use third-party organizers and other software? </h4><br>  The answer to this question is quite simple: if for successful completion of the task it is easier for you to write everything in Outlook, OneNote, Evernote or Notepad - do it.  If it is more convenient for you to write with a pencil in a notebook - use this method.  If you prefer to keep everything in your head - this is also an option.  The most important thing is that the successful completion of the task is primary for you, and the logging helps to achieve the goal.  If you diligently write everything down to your favorite task manager, but the tasks are still not executed on time, then you need to change the organizer or approach. <br><br><h4>  Instead of output </h4><br>  Self-organization and the ability to distribute priorities will help you to successfully cope with complex tasks and get real pleasure from it. <br><br>  But for these tips to help, you really need to be result-oriented.  Without this, no method, advice or someone else's example will help you learn how to manage your time effectively.  And yes, you must have a goal - for which you need to do everything.  :-) <br><br>  But how IT companies improve the productivity of their developers, I wrote in one of the <a href="http://it.rabota.ua/post/2012/02/09/kak_zastavit_razrabotchika_byt_produktivnym.aspx">past articles</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/166363/">https://habr.com/ru/post/166363/</a></p>
