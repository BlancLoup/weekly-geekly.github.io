    </i> <h2>  <font color="#0071c5">1. ‚ÄúI realized that courage is not the absence of fear, but victory over it.</font>  <font color="#0071c5">The brave is not the one who is not afraid, but the one who has overcome this fear "</font> </h2><br>  This is not about the initial absence of fear, but about the ability to face face to face with your fears and overcome them. <br><br>  We gain strength and courage by <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/chtoby-stat-liderom-dlya-drugikh-stante-snachala-liderom-dlya-sebya/">overcoming our fears and weaknesses</a> .  Therefore, if a person initially did not have a shadow of fear, this does not mean that he is full of courage. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">2. "Everything seems impossible until it is done"</font> </h2><br>  This quote more clearly reflects the essence of Nelson Mandela.  Everyone thought his fight for equality was meaningless until he won it. <br><br>  People are too often pessimistic and afraid to take on what is usually considered impossible.  But the framework of "impossibility" is constantly changing thanks to those who are confident in their abilities. <br><br>  They make the impossible real, while non-believers continue to tell themselves that going to the next level is certainly incredible. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">3. "We need to wisely allocate time and constantly remember that it is always suitable for the right things."</font> </h2><br>  The most convenient time to do what you want is now!  When it comes to time, there are no ‚Äúifs‚Äù and ‚Äúbuts‚Äù.  You may not have a second chance, and therefore always <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/10-prostykh-del-kotorye-nuzhno-sdelat-posle-probuzhdeniya-chtoby-den-nachalsya-pozitivno/">use your time wisely</a> and realize the drop-down opportunities. <br><br>  Just imagine what would happen if Mandela began to defend his fellow citizens 10 or 20 years later. <br>  Would he succeed? <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">4. "Success brings not money, but freedom"</font> </h2><br>  Success is often measured by the amount of wealth accumulated by a person, but this is far from the truth.  Everyone means something different to success, but money always wakes greed in people. <br><br>  You should reconsider your definition of success and supplement it with more significant and valuable things, for example, a beloved and enjoyable career, the ability to surround yourself with your family and live freely where you want. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">5. "The bright head and kind heart is a tremendous union"</font> </h2><br>  Anyone who has a bright mind and a good heart has enough strength to change the world for the better. <br>  Nelson Mandela got a combination of mind and soul, and he used it to achieve equality for his fellow citizens, regardless of his own interests. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">6. ‚ÄúHaving fulfilled obligations to fellow citizens and the country, a person can sleep peacefully‚Äù</font> </h2><br>  Mandela felt he could relax when he paid the debt to people.  This was his life priority, and he thought that without fulfilling his mission, he could not sleep peacefully. <br><br>  Can you rest easy?  Have you helped your fellow man? <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">7. ‚ÄúEveryone can rise above the circumstances and achieve success if he is dedicated and passionate about his work‚Äù</font> </h2><br>  In the end, it is dedication and interest in what you do every day that determine <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/5-knig-o-biznese-dobitsya-uspekha/">whether you will succeed or not</a> . <br><br>  Anything is possible if you love your work and fully dedicate yourself to it.  This statement is perfectly illustrated by the passion shown by Nelson Mandela, and the success he has achieved thanks to her. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">8. "To be free, it is not enough to get rid of the shackles.</font>  <font color="#0071c5">For this you need to live, respecting and promoting the freedom of others. ‚Äù</font> </h2><br>  The desire to help others is peculiar to people, at least most of us.  Therefore, we should help others to be truly pleased with ourselves and our lives. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">9. ‚ÄúJudge me not by my success, but by how many times I fell and rose again.‚Äù</font> </h2><br>  People are often evaluated, relying solely on their success, because usually this is the only thing that sees the majority.  But about all the falls and rises they do not know. <br><br>  Behavior should be assessed, not the result. <br><br>  PS We recommend another article on the topic - <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/uroki-uspekha-i-produmannykh-resheniy/">Lessons from success and thoughtful solutions from Mozart, Picasso and Kobe Bryant</a> . <br><br>  Translated by Vyacheslav Davidenko, founder of <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/">MBA Consult</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300380/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300380/</a></p>
