Well, well, they are not involved in the very fact of our birth.  Although it is very controversial.  Do not think anything vulgar, it's not about adultery.  We are talking about people who create something new in science and technology, in the broadest sense of the word.  Today is the day of the inventor and innovator. <br><br>  We will not reveal the truth to anyone if we say that our civilization is thoroughly technocratic.  The need to fight for their survival and the mysteriously developed intellect of the ancient hominids contributed to the development of skills of complex teamwork, the beginnings of language, the first primitive tools from the materials at hand, and here you have already invented writing, mathematics, metal processing, money, gunpowder it is still spinning! ‚Äù, penicillin, tank wedges, carpet bombing, core splitting,‚Äú Let's go! ‚Äù, lunar rover, split warheads, Intel 8080, mobile phone, Internet and computer viruses. <br><br>  Many inventions are created daily around the world.  Most of them will never be claimed by anyone.  And no one will know how many great discoveries, phenomena, machines, instruments and devices have disappeared into obscurity.  But look around: everything man-made, what you see was once invented by someone.  We sleep, work, carry, eat, drive, heal and use the fruits of someone's inventions in every way.  Perhaps, almost the entire population of our planet owes its existence to inventions in medicine, agriculture, energy and many other areas.  But in honoring inventors, do not forget about the second ‚Äúhalf of the holiday‚Äù - rationalizers.  These are those who improve and modernize someone's inventions, often repeatedly increasing the efficiency or quality of the original object, method, device or machine. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  People love to find out who is the best.  A sense of rivalry and competition lies at the core of human nature.  And so the <s>wars do not stop</s> so many all sorts of lists of "most-most" - athletes, scientists, fighter pilots.  This made a fortune the publishers of the Guinness Book of Records.  Naturally, there are ratings of the best inventors.  But how to evaluate the "best" in this case?  The most useful invention?  And what is his estimate: in money, in saved lives, in preserved health, in the degree of comfort given, in the number of defeated enemies, in tons, in conventional units of happiness?  Choose the best inventor of the most used invention?  Well, how to choose, for example, between electricity, telephone, car and computer?

      In general, ungrateful and meaningless is an occupation, to choose the best inventor.  So we just want to congratulate all those who create something new, which makes our lives safer, easier, longer, which makes us happier, which saves our time, effort and money. <br><br>  Happy holiday, inventors and innovators! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/227645/">https://habr.com/ru/post/227645/</a></p>
