Or will go after reading this text.  We are talking <b>exclusively</b> about automatic partner systems (Google Adsence, YAN, Adfox, etc.).  Work directly with the advertiser and through advertising agencies is not considered. <br><br>  These are not tips / recommendations, but facts and figures that I received on the basis of working with dozens of diverse sites, bringing them to a good income. <br><br>  <b>1) Local standards work better than systems recommends.</b>

      It is worth placing the advertising blocks of those formats that are common in the region where your traffic comes from.  For example, the block 240x400 works better in Russia than any other, even larger.  Ideally, for each region with a significant share of traffic, show your ad format. <br><br>  It should also be borne in mind that the cost of a click in each region is different and may vary significantly. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1e9/d72/673/1e9d726730e04cfe9ab0fde1e43270db.png" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>2) The location of ad units affects revenue more format</b> <br><br>  There is an old bike about the three rules of a successful store: location, location and location.  For the ad unit is the same, it is important to get to the first screen.  The higher and more noticeable are the blocks, the more they give income.  At the same time, it is important to make a good indentation around the blocks, not to stick them to each other and content. <br><br>  They also work quite well: fixing an ad block in place when scrolling, embedding text blocks in the content gap, placing them in a container on top of the content (with the close button). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a00/378/579/a00378579c5f41a59e38a6e09c241fe3.png" alt="image"><br>  <b>3) Multiple partner systems are better than one.</b> <br><br>  Each system has its own characteristics.  Where Google Adsense falls through income, the YAN can speak and vice versa.  In addition, in one system, two ad units often show one ad.  In my practice, always the combination of two systems (in places and in rotation) gives a better result than one.  And three is better than two. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d3c/e8d/2d8/d3ce8d2d85bd424ca65c9ae136c0b4d6.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>4) Teaser networks are not so scary</b> <br><br>  They almost do not compete with the display context, just take their (usually last) place on the page and give their own penny. <br><br>  But teaser tizerke strife.  One can give several times more than the other.  In addition, they should always be filtered and monitored, so that no shock or unpleasant pictures will slip through. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e23/79e/8b3/e2379e8b3f654d01a5ce6e833c4b001f.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>5) The sequence of loading items on the page</b> <br><br>  The speed of modern providers is compensated by the weight of the sites.  The creators have not followed the weight of pictures and design elements in kilobytes for a long time, with the exception of special fans of this business. <br><br>  Anyway, the page loading takes many seconds, especially on the mobile Internet.  Want to control the user's attention - manage this download, but do not hand it over to the zoo of browsers, each of which will do it in its own way. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9d1/e88/4da/9d1e884da7aa4fafb6583e148b6c605b.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>6) Before the AB-tests do AA-tests</b> <br><br>  Affiliate systems operate on the auction principle, according to unknown simple mortal algorithms.  The fluctuations of the price of a click, CTR and other indicators in them are the height of the waves in the pool in the country when children are splashing in it.  These fluctuations are easily confused with the impact of your changes on the site.  I do not know of any other way to level them, how to make AA tests.  That is, put in rotation two identical blocks and achieve statistically identical indicators for them.  After that, you can start the AB test, and even better, do not turn off the same AA, but twist all three options. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0ae/141/ef9/0ae141ef9ab24c6ca8ca229edd2b821c.png" alt="image"><br>  <b>7) Mobile formats are optional for mobile devices.</b> <br><br>  Strangely enough, immobile blocks on smartphones can give (and most often give) more, it all depends on the layout of the site. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/925/38e/ed0/92538eed0d124001942e036447b74f3f.png" alt="image"><br>  <b>8) Adaptive sites give less revenue</b> <br><br>  They are very difficult to select formats and the income from them is generally less.  If it is possible to collect a sweet couple (desktop + mobile site), it makes sense to do it for the sake of income. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/270/dcd/9e1/270dcd9e132d4ccf944de328979cff7c.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>9) Number of views per session</b> <br><br>  It's time to increase this parameter.  Bring search to a more prominent place, share content, include blocks of recommended content, etc.  It should be understood that each additional page view is revenue. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/400/c84/857/400c84857f024a4fb800ed745f5d24b7.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>10) Search monetize separately</b> <br><br>  If the site has an active search, then for pages with its results, it makes sense to make your template with special search blocks, they show more relevant ads.  Also here you can well show blocks with product ads. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ae8/5d3/568/ae85d3568abd406f9d616189c3a3fbeb.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Total</b> <br><br>  Scrupulous work with the site allows you to increase its income several times.  It should be borne in mind that one change affects the other, so the result should be assessed after completing all the items. <br>  It should be borne in mind that some techniques can reduce the quality of the site.  Also, they may be prohibited by separate advertising systems, read their rules carefully. <br><br>  What income can be considered good in numbers?  For me, less than $ 1 per CPM from the page (total for all advertising systems) is bad, up to $ 2 is normal, $ 3 is good.  Yes, such round numbers are easy to remember. <br><br>  All good monetization! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/317136/">https://habr.com/ru/post/317136/</a></p>
