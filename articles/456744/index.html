Recently, I conducted an audit of reminders on a smartphone and I want to share a list of problems / tasks that I managed to solve with them. <br><br>  Perhaps you will think about something important while reading this list. <br><br>  Of course, we want to reduce the number of signals jerking us.  But some important things I do not want to forget.  Therefore, I set special reminders.

      What you need to remember to make life more convenient and more complete? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Look at things in the morning (8-00 on weekdays and at 10-00 on weekends)</b> <br><br>  I forgot to look at the to-do list for the day for a long time.  I prepared the list in the evening, then once a week.  But from time to time I came across a situation that in the morning I had to take something from home in order to work with it during the day.  I get up in the morning completely clean, carefree.  And, accordingly, he recalled the task already in transport on the way to work, grievingly looking at the problem book.  Then I transferred the task to tomorrow and the next day the situation was repeated, because I remembered this business again only in transport. <br><br>  With the help of this reminder, I instilled in the habit of looking through the to-do list in the morning and never come across such situations. <br><br>  <b>Drink pills, vitamins, put injections (7-55)</b> <br><br>  Also morning task.  Many people use dietary supplements and make-up injections like B12 in soft parts of the body.  But they forget to drink and prick at the right time. <br><br>  It is worth making this reminder.  So your body will receive the necessary substances at the very time when it is recommended by experts and doctors. <br><br>  You can also set up a similar reminder in the evening, for example, before leaving work, to drink dietary supplements and pills. <br><br>  <b>Go to bed (23-30)</b> <br><br>  Very useful reminder.  I have been around for about 3 years.  Prior to installation, I could not lay myself down earlier 25-30 (1-30 of the usual time).  And I always didn‚Äôt get enough sleep, because I got up at 7-05. <br><br>  I put this reminder, because I realized that sleep is more important than reading these of our Internet.  In the beginning she did not give effect.  I turned it off and sat on.  But over time, she began to act.  She constantly reminded that you need to go to bed before 24-00.  And in the end, I began to go to bed earlier, began to get enough sleep overnight, improved immunity, appetite and potency. <br><br>  Why exactly 23-30?  This allows you to complete the case before 24-00 (clean the feathers, watch a video or series, read the article). <br><br>  <b>Speak with your son on the phone (Tue and Thu, 15-00)</b> <br><br>  I am divorced and communicate with my son on weekends.  But I want to communicate more often.  Before installing this reminder, I could call him in a week, but I could forget, because there are emergency jobs a week long and even longer at work.  The son is more important than rummaging, and this reminder allows you to not forget about what is important in the urgent stream. <br><br>  <b>Call Granny (2 times a month)</b> <br><br>  I live in my world, where I want to have a strong family, as far as possible.  And so that all my favorite people were not lonely.  But avraly, fast life, goals ... I forgot to call the granny who lives in the village. <br><br>  She has a mobile phone and a landline phone.  If I had a good Internet experience, I would teach her video communication.  I hope someone from the operators someday will make the Internet there. <br><br>  In general, now like a clock.  If Granny herself did not dial me, then I call her every two weeks. <br><br>  <b>Clean the toothpaste Druzhku teeth (Wed and Sun, 23-00)</b> <br><br>  Every week my dog ‚Äã‚Äãneeds to brush his teeth with a special paste.  Without a reminder, I forgot about it, cleaned it with a simple brush, and cleaning with paste was shifted for a day or several days. <br><br>  Now everything is clear according to the recommendations of the best dog lovers. <br><br>  The same reminder is worth digging tick remedies (once every 3 weeks) <br><br>  The same reminder is to clean the aquarium with three turtles (guess what their name is?), Which I always forgot.  The yellow, thick color of the suspension was a good reminder of cleaning, but it is still better to clean their apartment on time, rather than arrange a general water change once a month. <br><br>  In general, we care for those who have tamed! <br><br>  <b>Make the counters on mos.ru (15th number, 14-00)</b> <br><br>  Oh yes, the eternal problem that was solved by a reminder.  If the meters are paid later or ahead of time, then payments begin to float on the amount, it becomes absolutely impossible to understand how much water we spent this month, whether there is any error.  Bardak, in general.  And now everything is exactly on time, of course, in order. <br><br>  <b>Clean winter shoes (Aug. 1)</b> <br><br>  I generally constantly forgot about it.  Maybe this is paranoia, but it is believed that it is necessary to keep an eye on winter shoes when not wearing them.  Cream applied, look at her in love eyes.  Honey, good shoes.  My.  High quality.  Favorite.  Well, you understand. <br><br>  I did not clean it in the summer, and after installing the reminder I began to care at least once in the middle of summer. <br>  Maybe with the summer you need to do something similar.  Need to think. <br><br>  The same goes for clothes made of leather.  Winter coat made of leather. <br><br>  Reminder bonus allows you to review the clothes and shoes for the winter to purchase them in the summer, while discounts. <br><br>  <b>Put a bit on the number or make a paid call from a spare mobile phone (every month)</b> <br><br>  All the time I forgot to put money on the number from which the redirection costs to the current number.  Because of this, he sometimes turned off.  Many are afraid to use the autopayment.  In this case, such a reminder will help.  Now I go to the LC and replenish the account.  I am in touch. <br><br>  A similar task arises, if the operator forces to make paid calls once in a while. <br><br>  <b>Charge all equipment (once in 3 months)</b> <br><br>  I have a lot of technology that I rarely use: JBL speaker, spare smartphones, Sony a7 camera, bluetooth headset, and so on.  It's a pity to sell them, since I use them a couple of times a year.  That lie.  If they are not charged, the battery may be covered. <br><br>  Now I periodically take them out and charge them to the full level.  Dear devices protected. <br><br>  <b>Write down the weight and pressure (once a week)</b> <br><br>  With them such a thing - it is better to monitor periodically, at the same time.  I always forgot to record weight and pressure.  Therefore, the measurement graphs were torn.  Now I am keeping the schedule as it should be. <br><br><hr><br>  Please share what reminders you use? <br><br>  I will supplement the article with your help.  And with God.  Just kidding  Only with yours. <br><br>  <b>UPD from comments</b> <br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/nikolaby/" class="user_link">NikolaBY Water the</a> flowers every four days.  This reminder saved a lot of plants :) <br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/miller777/" class="user_link">Miller777</a> Every few years: to renew the license for weapons, rights, do a fluorography, visit the dentist <br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/miller777/" class="user_link">Miller777</a> and <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/rohan66/" class="user_link">Rohan66</a> make paid calls once a month from a spare SIM card <br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/andreyyu/" class="user_link">AndreyYu</a> Once <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/andreyyu/" class="user_link">every</a> few years - update already made vaccinations <br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/ya_ka/" class="user_link">ya_ka</a> Extending vehicle inspection, extending insurance, driver's license and other documents <br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/kaer_morchen/" class="user_link">Kaer_Morchen</a> extension of domains (once a year), preventive visits to an ophthalmologist and a dentist (once a year), pay property and car taxes (once a year) <br><br><hr><br>  <b>UPD2 I also remembered what I used to do</b> <br><br>  <b>Revise goals for the year (May and September)</b> <br>  [Together with the idea of <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/dolovar/" class="user_link">dolovar</a> ] <br><br>  I have a tradition.  Every time for the new year I go to the bathhouse (but also at home).  There I am summing up the year and planning a new year.  I set goals, prioritize desires.  It is impossible to forget.  About the new year are buzzing from any iron. <br><br>  But by the middle of the year, and even earlier, it happens, some of the planned already disappears.  It is necessary to update the goals, otherwise, and so it happened, at the end of the year you find out that most of the planned cases could not be done. <br><br>  With a reminder in the middle of the year about updating the annual goals, your goals are always updated, you are doing what is important and important. <br><br>  <b>Daily ritual (7-20 on weekdays, 9-20 on weekends)</b> <br><br>  After reading the " <a href="https://book24.ru/product/magiya-utra-kak-pervyy-chas-dnya-opredelyaet-vash-uspekh-195311/">Magic of the Morning</a> " motif, I had a morning ritual, including those things for which I did not have enough time and energy at another time.  Now in the morning I shake the press with all sorts of sadistic methods and pump my voice in the M-N-L lowing method. <br><br>  In order not to forget about this as if my desire, as long as there is no habit, you can use this reminder <br><br>  <b>View weather (8-20)</b> <br><br>  I was the champion of leaving the house dressed not for the weather.  Forget the umbrella and get wet?  Wear a light shirt, although it gets colder in the evening?  Dress for the winter, although it is spring?  These were the situations. <br><br>  A weather reminder allows you to be dressed for the weather. <br><br><hr><br>  <b>UPD3 From my wife</b> <br><br>  <b>Sign up for a manicure (every 3 weeks) and a hairdresser (every 6 weeks)</b> <br>  [Reminder also uses <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/1cenova/" class="user_link">1cenova</a> ] <br>  To the good queue masters.  In time to get a manicure or haircut, you need to set a reminder to make an appointment with them and get there in time. <br><br>  <b>Buy the cheapest tickets (once a year)</b> <br>  I love to relax in the winter in Asia.  Many go on vacation only in summer.  It so happens that tickets and hotels are cheaper to buy if you buy in advance.  If you relax at the same time, then the time of cheap tickets also comes at the same time, for example, six months before the holiday. <br><br>  With such a reminder you can always buy the cheapest tickets and hotel reservations. <br><br>  <b>Record the results of the month in the results of the year (once a month)</b> <br><br>  When my wife sat down to sum up the year, she had a stupor.  Recall what he did all year hard.  And remember what he did in this month easier. <br><br>  If you set a reminder to record the results of the month, then the results of the year will be experienced more fully and happier. <br><br>  <b>Sign up for an inspection of the teeth and ultrasonic cleaning (once a year)</b> <br><br>  Brushing teeth is usually carried out once a year, and even enters according to the OMS.  Inspection is also carried out once a year.  It is worth all this to combine. <br><br>  In order not to forget to take care of your teeth, you can leave such a reminder. <br><br>  <b>Develop a good habit (several times a day)</b> <br><br>  Drink a glass of water, take a break while working (according to the <a href="https://book24.ru/product/taym-menedzhment-po-pomidoru-kak-kontsentrirovatsya-na-odnom-dele-khotya-by-25-minut-oblozhka-657978/">tomato</a> method, for example), do eye exercises. <br><br><hr><br>  I would be pleased if you now open your smartphone and add the necessary reminder </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/456744/">https://habr.com/ru/post/456744/</a></p>
