My first significant acquisition was the iPhone 3Gs, which actually introduced me to apple orchard in Silicon Valley.  At the time of purchase, the iPhone 4 was already successfully selling on the market, for which I decided not to spend money right away, especially given the fact that from the design point of view I liked the Troika more.  At the same time, not excluding my negative attitude to the use of covers on phones / smartphones, although recently I have revised my view on bumpers, especially like SGP creations.  Everything was great in the compartment with a jailbreak and applications from Cydia, the Troika met all my needs, with the exception of a not very long-lasting battery and very strong heating.  But the time has come and thanks to the excellent marketing progress and, paying tribute to fashion, I still changed it to 4S.  It will be superfluous to compare, the iPhone 4S is an excellent smartphone, there is nothing bad, nothing special to write.  To sum up, I‚Äôll say that from my point of view, this is an excellent mobile system, fast, reliable, with a large number of applications and meeting all the basic requirements.

      After some time, by chance, I received an offer to buy a new HTC One X at a tempting price, and there were many conflicting reviews on the device, especially regarding the operating time.  As far as I know, it is currently one of the most productive Android devices.  At the time of purchase, I had some idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis mobile system, in part thanks to this resource, and as a result I bought it even cheaper than I planned and decided that it would be more than enough for the development of the platform.  The first impression was ambiguous due to the abundance of the necessary settings and strange at that time application store, in the top of which there were applications that were just terrible from my point of view, but the problem here is in the Google approach, which do not stop using the App Store to race with such methods, I really hope that they will reconsider some of the priorities.  But I will not focus my attention on this, I read a little resources devoted to android, tested the applications and compiled my personal ‚Äúhave have‚Äù list, did a complete reset, put the applications and everything was fine until I noticed the periodic hangs of the phone, It was especially critical when it came to the ‚Äúdialer‚Äù function, of course I was very angry, but we would write it off on my unstable psyche.  I started looking for solutions on the thematic forums and it all came down to ‚Äúpenetration‚Äù into the stock, I did not do that, but nothing, we still eventually became friends, but with another device.  Summing up, I‚Äôll say Android is a very good mobile system with a wide choice of applications, customization options, with some problems concerning smoothness of work, but I hope that this can be solved soon with the announcement of the new version.  I will make a small footnote, I recently purchased a tablet on Android and I really like it and more than the iPad, although many will disagree with me. <br><br><h4>  How it all went on. </h4><br><br>  Then, Windows Phone appeared in my life, represented by the Nokia Lumia 920, well promoted in the media.  The reason for the purchase was rather nostalgia and attractive design for a couple with faith in the company, which I always respected for their creations and innovations and the desire to taste the unexplored fruit of technical thought and perfection from Microsoft.  Without regret, I invested my 25,000 rubles into the future of the Finnish company and received my device on pre-order with a nice bonus in the form of ‚Äútrendy‚Äù pink headphones with the Monster Beats logo already on November 12 (if you need to contact us). <br><br>  I actually launch this miracle and start the initial setup process, by the way, you can do more of them here than in iOS when you first start, I log in through my outlook.com account, which by default is called ‚ÄúMicrosoft Account‚Äù and Nokia account (by default) I haven‚Äôt known its charms yet, but Nokia seems to have recently come out in Beta mode, but this is another story) and now the desktop with tiles starts up, which looks very dull at first.  We change the color of the tiles, download the necessary programs, adjust the size of the tiles and nothing, quite tolerable, ascetic and looks very respectable. <br>  Just a little talk about the device itself.  Without a doubt, it has a charm, a very beautiful design highlighted by tiles, which look very harmonious.  I have been using it since November 12, 2012, there is not the slightest scratch, either on the screen or on the case and the backlash, too, I wore my jeans pants, trousers and breast pocket for the first 3 months, I don‚Äôt wear keys, and it‚Äôs not scary since they are in my key-case, little thing in the wallet, we don‚Äôt cherish, it‚Äôs just more convenient for me.  The weight did not embarrass me, I am a strong man, but I became even stronger thanks to him. <br><br><h4>  Briefly about applications. </h4><br><br>  Here it is the Achilles heel of a relatively new system - the lack of applications as such.  Moreover, I found those times when there were really no standing applications, but in half a year almost everything I needed appeared, there are, of course, some good applications among them, and there are terrifying ones.  After all, I still buy the phone for myself and it drives me into a light stupor when my friends say to me: ‚ÄúYou have so few applications and no recent games.‚Äù  I simply answer: ‚ÄúFor games I have a computer in which there are 5 games that I‚Äôve been missing for more than one year, I have all the practically necessary applications, what is the use of applications that I don‚Äôt need?‚Äù  Of course, I understand the consequences of this and the dependence of development on public interest, but what the hell am I writing about myself and I hope you will understand me. <br><br><h4>  But actually what I want: </h4><br><br><ol><li>  After the last update, which, by the way, not everyone got everything, a strange bug appeared, after each full charge the phone loses 30 percent charge overnight, I was embarrassed, of course, and I decided to do the first, it occurred to me: I turned it off and turned on that's it - it turns out that only 4% of the charge was gone in a night.  And this is not an isolated case, I now always, without hesitation, reboot, I used to say so, but I don‚Äôt want to; </li><li>  I want a tile with a clock and an alarm time, something similar is on HTC in their hub and yes, I want it on my Lumia; </li><li>  I want the ability to manually set the time to update the tile, right up to the every minute update, it would be especially useful for programs such as the Flight Track and yes, I am well aware of the power consumption; </li><li>  I want a notification center and the ability to reply messages without opening the program (hello biteSMS, I miss!); </li><li>  I would like to add in the mode of switching between applications on the long menu tap, in which you can close / open / and configure the application settings in the background; </li><li>  I want to see the number of applications without manual counting; </li><li>  I want an application in which you can see the necessary up-to-date information at my request, for example, the name of the access point, connection speed, connection via VPN, when we wait, of course, and so on, that will only climb into your head, let them complement anyone; </li><li>  I want to create folders on the desktop; </li><li>  I want the top bar to be always open; </li><li>  I want to be able to turn off the ‚ÄúSearch‚Äù button, or at least launch by long press, or double tapu, in order to avoid an accidental launch, which many people are dissatisfied with; </li><li>  I want to be able to turn off the sounds when dialing a number without turning off the sounds when typing; </li><li>  I want to be able to turn off the vibration and button illumination, although the work of the vibration motors has become much better since the last update; </li><li>  I want to fix the synchronization and stop losing contacts during it.  Stably losing about 3-5 contacts, but on the outlook they peacefully wait for me; </li><li>  I want to correct the stupid ‚Äúmobile 1‚Äù and ‚Äúmobile 2‚Äù, instead they give us back the good old ‚ÄúStationary, worker‚Äù, ‚ÄúMobile, worker‚Äù, etc., you can do it with capital letters, I do not mind. </li></ol><br><br>  And at the end of all this, even though it is horror as subjective, but I specifically asked friends about what they think about the Lumia 920 and all that concern it and received such answers, corrected only the grammar and removed eloquent smiles: <br><ul><li>  Cool pipe, looks very solid and the Windows itself looks very nice. </li><li>  Pleasantly in the hand, the screen is cool, the brightness is at the height! </li><li>  If the next iPhone is as innovative as my 5th, I will buy the one you talked about, well, with 41Mp. </li><li>  The sound is awesome in headphones, the screen is super, hard though, but it looks impressive. </li><li>  Cool, yesterday noticed that in the series "Arrow" lit up many times;) </li></ul><br><br>  There were no negative reviews, among those polled there were not those who seek out productive games and spend hours on it, the maximum is Angry Birds and Fruit Ninja, but there are still those who now want Subway Surfers. <br><br>  <i>Summing up, I will say that I received exactly what I expected, there are drawbacks, they are certainly essential, but I can and I can put up with them in the future, but I would like my wishes to be taken into account.</i>  <i>I would personally give this platform time before the end of the year, and if the development is significant, then I think it will press the ranks of other mobile operating systems, especially iOS, they are somewhat similar, but time is tight.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Would I recommend buying a Lumia 920?</i>  <i>Yes.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Would I recommend buying Windows Phone 8 in the Lumia 920?</i>  <i>Probably not.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>I think it would be more correct to look at the vector of the development of Windows Phone and take a new flagship, by that time you look and the new version will arrive in time.</i> <br><br>  <i>Thanks for attention!</i> <habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/178171/">https://habr.com/ru/post/178171/</a></p>
