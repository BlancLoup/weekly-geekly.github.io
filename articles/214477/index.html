If you at least once faced with the task of creating a system of key performance indicators (KPI) for employees or projects, you will most likely agree that this is not an easy task.  ‚ÄúHead-on‚Äù solutions do not work here, many obvious indicators for verification turn out to be non-informative, give a distorted view of the situation, or can be easily distorted by employees. <br>  In order to reduce precious time, keep nerve cells healthy and give ‚Äúinspiration‚Äù, I suggest to get acquainted with the list of popular KPIs for IT.  Perhaps some of them will help with the solution of your problem. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Figures taken from the collection: <i>KPI Mega Library: 17,000 Key Performance Indicators</i> <br>  Buy at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/KPI-Mega-Library-Performance-Indicators/dp/1451551665">Amazon</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3b4/7cc/a3e/3b47cca3eb95464d8acfbd285e9ec3fd.png"><br><br>  Additional resources to help you: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.kpisolutions.ru/">www.kpisolutions.ru</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.kpilib.ru/">www.kpilib.ru</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.kpilibrary.com/">www.kpilibrary.com</a> </li></ul>
