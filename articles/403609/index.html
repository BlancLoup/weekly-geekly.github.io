As they say, at the request of workers: e-bidet.  Yes, not exactly the same thing, but we tried and searched. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/22d/ff1/90f/22dff190f5b6440bbe64efdbee2b5f8e.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Before we briefly talk about what we have encountered, I would like to make a few digressions.  First, deal with what kind of "bidet" we will talk about.  So, <b>the first retreat</b> . <br><br>  Still, there is a part of people for whom this item is a certain status thing, an indicator of wealth, etc. And there is a part of people who in a bidet see only an accessory for hygienic purposes.  Here we are - about the second.

      We have before us one of the hygienic alternatives to a special bath, along with (excuse me) wet toilet paper, a special smell of water, which some divert through a plumbing ‚Äúhub‚Äù, etc. <br><br>  <b>The second retreat.</b>  <b>Terminology</b> <br><br>  If a bidet is added to the toilet seat, or, to put it more simply, washing, conceptually in a bidet, it can turn, but in fact, in form, it will remain the toilet seat.  At acquaintance with this accessory, it seemed to us more correct to call it ‚Äúelectronic toilet seat‚Äù, ‚Äúadvanced toilet seat‚Äù, but, nevertheless, we will remain within the framework of the manufacturer‚Äôs terminology: ‚ÄúElectronic bidet‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Third retreat.</b>  <b>Aliexpress</b> <br><br>  Frankly speaking, we didn‚Äôt go deep into this topic, but we were able to facilitate your work in some ways: we often come from a range of similar products from China, and there are enough offers on Aliexpress.  They are searched for by the requests " <a href="https://ru.aliexpress.com/wholesale%3FcatId%3D0%26initiative_id%3DSB_20170503205609%26isPremium%3Dy%26SearchText%3D%25D1%258D%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5%2B%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5">Electronic bidet</a> ", " <a href="https://ru.aliexpress.com/wholesale%3FcatId%3D0%26initiative_id%3DSB_20170506032401%26isPremium%3Dy%26SearchText%3D%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D1%2583%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5%2B%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5%2B%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BB%25D1%258F%2B%25D1%2583%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0">Intellectual toilet seat</a> ", but for the price nothing cheap was found. <br><br>  The price range here, in Russia, is quite comparable and even less.  If, however, add the cost of delivery, then to carry from China is at retail - not very profitable.  One of the most similar examples can be <a href="https://ru.aliexpress.com/item/Intelligent-toilet-seat-automatic-electronic-bidet-toilet-washlet-bidet-seat-with-hip-clean-function-cover-for/2048965946.html%3Fspm%3D2114.03020208.3.86.PNmmy4%26ws_ab_test%3Dsearchweb0_0,searchweb201602_5_10152_10065_10151_10068_436_10136_10137_10157_10060_10138_10155_10062_10156_10154_10056_5140019_10055_10054_10059_10099_10103_10102_10096_10169_10147_10052_10053_10142_10107_10050_10051_10084_10083_10080_10082_10081_10110_10111_10112_10113_10114_10181_10183_10182_10032_10078_10079_10077_10073_10070_10123_10127_10125,searchweb201603_2,ppcSwitch_4_ppcChannel%26btsid%3D3baa6254-1550-432e-83ca-7d5820c01951%26algo_expid%3Dc905697c-2faa-4707-98f1-1473413154eb-0%26algo_pvid%3Dc905697c-2faa-4707-98f1-1473413154eb">found here</a> .  The Russian market also <a href="https://market.yandex.ru/search%3Fcvredirect%3D2%26text%3D%25D1%258D%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5%2520%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%26local-offers-first%3D0%26deliveryincluded%3D0%26onstock%3D1">jumps</a> from 16 to 30 thousand. <br><br>  Our electronic bidet goes under the brand LS Daewon, in the assortment of which there are <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/ls-daewon.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dbide%26utm_campaign%3Ddaewon">several models from 16 to 28 thousand rubles</a> . <br><br>  In this case, in our opinion, the difference between the closest-for-price models is not so great, and you can get by with the seats of the initial price range.  For the test, we chose <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/daewon-dib-c540.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dbide%26utm_campaign%3D540">Daewon DIB-C540</a> . <br><br>  <b>Installation</b> <br><br>  We need to start with the fact that we approached the instructions with surprising thoroughness: it is simply corny to read it.  Everything is very clearly shown, illustrated, so even seeing a bag of consumables, it seems that there will be no labor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/def/c28/74a/defc2874abf44b0a8b82913bdd18d36f.JPG"><br><br>  The delivery package includes all the necessary elements in order to fasten the seat and connect it, so you don‚Äôt have to go to the store additionally.  The only thing is the hose itself.  What is the feature here. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e4a/d16/04a/e4ad1604a05044239c8c0908cbce8721.jpg"><br><br>  For example, when one end of the hose approaches the tank, the other - on the right - comes out of the wall.  According to the logic of the creators, you need to unwind the one that comes from the tank, because it is connected to the device from this side: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/7b9/611/7a9/7b96117a9cb14a8fa52cd1062560b090.JPG"><br><br>  But for some reason it is more convenient for us to turn to the right.  Yes, corny - a man right handed.  And there is a little more space.  In this case, the size of the complete hose may be limited, because the filter must also be attached to the ‚Äúsplitter‚Äù that is installed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/a15/5ce/a8b/a155cea8b79a4a70a59b9629c3536191.JPG"><br><br>  In general, returning to the installation.  In total, time for everything about everything leaves, probably, about 25 minutes, if with smoke breaks: the task is simple, turn off the water, place the ‚Äúhub‚Äù and bring the hose through (or directly). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/4d7/43c/5cf/4d743c5cfe404cf99637c0b4735c244f.jpg"><br><br>  Next, remove your seat and secure with a special stand electronic bidet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/740/bc3/493/740bc34936af4fc5b895532ccfe3be3e.JPG"><br><br>  It makes sense to clarify that the device is universal.  The distance from the tank is adjusted with the help of a plastic layer and plain metal fasteners.  When assembled, it looks like this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/a79/e56/ff6/a79e56ff66544d09ac0e90402b896e5f.JPG"><br><br>  Further, as a constructor.  The seat moves on the arrow until it clicks.  And that's all. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/30f/2ed/3d9/30f2ed3d98c44b4486e64cba4c0704d4.JPG"><br><br>  After that, the device must be connected to the network.  The wire comes out on the opposite side of the control panel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/54a/580/693/54a5806935d74acfafa275dff22ae42c.JPG"><br><br>  And here, again, the nuance.  In the toilet, which was chosen for testing, there is no outlet - this is the ‚Äútechnical toilet‚Äù for draining from the kitchen.  I had to tighten the extension cord, which slightly violates the aesthetics of the room.  Usually, the outlet is exactly in dual bathrooms, but whether it can be permanently occupied is a question ... <br><br>  <b>Functionality</b> <br><br>  Everything that a bidet can do, and this - several modes of operation - is made on clear buttons, which will be to the right of the person sitting. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/574/a04/fef/574a04fef0e14a208e4c6a45fa1c0b5c.JPG"><br>  <i>Oh, those sweet graphics =)</i> <br><br>  Our smart toilet seat recognizes with a motion sensor whether someone is currently on top or not.  This is also done to avoid misunderstandings if someone decides to play around and just press a button.  In this case, nothing will happen. <br><br>  There are three basic modes: <br><br><ul><li>  Washing </li><li>  Bidet </li><li>  Turbo </li></ul><br>  Moreover, the use of the latter in the "lite" mode "Children" is impossible.  Also available "Drying", "Massage", "Pulse". <br><br>  For example, in the ‚ÄúMassage‚Äù mode the water jet will move back and forth, and during the pulsation the pressure will automatically change.  At the same time, the head power can be adjusted independently by means of the corresponding control buttons. <br><br>  An example of one of the modes: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SNXT6kWLEX4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  As you can see, the small shower itself goes down at an angle, which eliminates the risk of injury, scratches, etc. <br><br>  Another mode: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Pkw8KwiuGI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Mode "Drying".  In this mode, the ‚Äúwindow‚Äù opens to the right of the shower. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/884/ef9/ea1/884ef9ea1c5e4d4aaed4f44cbfba69e8.JPG"><br><br>  The operation time of this mode is three minutes. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/szdEg4ke9qU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The stop button turns off both the water supply and the device as a whole.  In order to turn off the toilet seat, the button must be held for three seconds. <br><br>  Also, in addition to adjusting the water intensity and modes, the user can control the temperature of the jet using the appropriate button and heated seats.  The latter possibility, by the way, does not seem so funny.  Who is not annoying to sit on the cold ?!  Br-rr-r. <br><br>  The manual also provides some recommendations for caring for the device and explains some additional features, including the deodorization function available for this model. <br><br>  In order for it to work correctly, you must install the cartridge that comes in the kit. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/78b/c71/90e/78bc7190e5574a36b6bcbff086b12364.JPG"><br><br>  For this purpose, a special opening is provided in the side of the housing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/9b7/745/374/9b7745374f254a23818771a1f94f97fd.JPG"><br><br>  The function will start automatically, but already the blowing intensity can be adjusted independently. <br><br>  <b>ECO mode</b> <br><br>  Separately, let's say a few words about power saving modes.  A single press activates the automatic mode, which provides for maintaining the temperature of the seat and water at 32 degrees.  At the same time at the time of use, you can manually adjust the temperature of the water. <br><br>  When you double-click on the "ECO" button, the green light is activated - the mode is off, and the heating will be carried out manually during use. <br><br>  Triple pressing will allow you to independently adjust the constant water temperature. <br><br>  The water in the device accumulates constantly!  The back, where the hose is connected, is the reservoir. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/978/15d/d48/97815dd485824e8cab2e1175a1ead479.JPG"><br><br>  You need to know this also because when you need to remove the device, the tank needs to be emptied.  This is done by pressing the universal button, which is easy to grope from the side of the wire. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/9c7/1da/c5d/9c71dac5d3a2445298dbcbe4a51b796b.JPG"><br><br>  Its versatility is that it is not only responsible for draining the water, but also brings a ‚Äúlatch‚Äù into the mechanism in order to remove the bidet-stool.  The mechanism looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/60c/db5/a70/60cdb5a709d446bc80d856ff3a63ad15.JPG"><br><br>  Such a seat contrastively is not much different from what we are used to for the most part: a circle + a lid. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/476/b46/2b3/476b462b3a40450aad8dc709f42b972f.JPG"><br><br>  At the same time, in terms of dimensions, it is not much beyond the scope of ordinary toilet seats: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/ccc/f70/998/cccf70998ef24d1ca2392e5206d83c67.JPG"><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Dimensions</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/51e/500/258/51e500258bb141caae0df441ce9f06f6.JPG"><br></div></div><br>  It remains to add a few words.  First, the difference between the two low-cost models. <br><table border="1"><tbody><tr><th>  Functions </th><th>  <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/daewon-dib-c500.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dbide%26utm_campaign%3D500">DIB-C500</a> </th><th>  <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/daewon-dib-c540.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dbide%26utm_campaign%3D540">C540</a> </th></tr><tr><td>  <b>Washing</b> </td><td>  there is </td><td>  there is </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Bidet</b> </td><td>  there is </td><td>  there is </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Turbo</b> </td><td>  there is </td><td>  there is </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Drying</b> </td><td>  - </td><td>  there is </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Air bubbles in the jet</b> </td><td>  there is </td><td>  there is </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>ECO automatic mode</b> </td><td>  there is </td><td>  there is </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Energy saving</b> </td><td>  there is </td><td>  there is </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Massage</b> </td><td>  there is </td><td>  there is </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Pulse</b> </td><td>  there is </td><td>  there is </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Hybrid heating</b> </td><td>  there is </td><td>  there is </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Seat heating</b> </td><td>  there is </td><td>  there is </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Microlift</b> </td><td>  there is </td><td>  there is </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Removable main body</b> </td><td>  there is </td><td>  there is </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Mode kids</b> </td><td>  there is </td><td>  there is </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Deodorization</b> </td><td>  - </td><td>  there is </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Price</b> </td><td>  15900 rubles </td><td>  18900 rubles </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  And also bring the technical characteristics of the model, which we got for review: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Specifications</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  Network voltage: AC 220V ~ 240V, 50-60 Hz </li><li>  Power consumption: 1270 W </li><li>  Cable length: 1.5 m </li><li>  Connection: direct to the cold water system </li><li>  Working water pressure: 0.7 ~ 0.75 kgf / m2 </li><li>  Water consumption: depending on the mode from 0.5 to 0.6 l / min </li><li>  Pressure control: 5 levels of adjustment </li><li>  Temperature control: 4 levels of adjustment </li><li>  Heating power: 1200 W </li><li>  Protection: thermal switch </li><li>  Heated seats: 4 levels of adjustment </li><li>  Power of heating of sitting: 55 W </li><li>  Drying temperature ~ 50 degrees </li><li>  Drying power: 250 W </li><li>  Weight: about 5 kg unpacked </li></ul><br></div></div><br>  As a conclusion, I would like to add a few words.  Usually, we try to provide our materials with arguments and counterarguments, statistics on the use of certain gadgets, often citing references to other people's publications. <br><br>  However, despite the fact that this review is about hygiene, the topic is quite ordinary and important, our thing is still intimate and individual, so we will not argue about whether it is necessary, not necessary, who needs it, but who - no.  Everyone's personal matter.  * <i><s>There must be an anecdote attributed to Ranevskaya</s></i> *. <br><br>  According to the device: an interesting thing, simple to install and manage, while not very different from the usual designs, so nothing unusual, in other words, a significant difference can not be felt.  The details also came up wisely.  So that the device does not creak, does not scratch the surface of the toilet, rubberized inserts are also provided: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/cdb/50e/648/cdb50e6481b1451586d258d4ac617526.JPG"><br><br>  Yes, they make the seat a little higher: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/2a2/147/9d8/2a21479d8bcc4805a8c0659b671f3bdd.JPG"><br><br>  But in general, it does not cause any discomfort. <br><br>  Also, the question arises whether it is necessary to justify this device, and if a little to speculate, it does not seem very far-fetched.  Indeed, an average person cannot put a bidet at home: fewer and less noble houses, more small apartments.  Russian-language Wikipedia, for example, claims that "synthetic designs" toilet + bidet became popular in many countries around the world, and the first "paperless toilets" <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5">appeared</a> in 1980.  Demand, therefore, is. <br><br>  The question remains the price.  It should be noted that if you do not go to extremes, considering the seats for 200 rubles and Villeroy &amp; Boch products, then the cost of a simple option can be calculated at several thousand rubles.  On average, let's say, <a href="https://market.yandex.ru/search%3Fcvredirect%3D2%26text%3D%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5%2520%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BB%25D1%258F%2520%25D1%2583%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%26local-offers-first%3D0%26deliveryincluded%3D0%26onstock%3D1">about 5,000</a> , including models with a ‚Äúmicrolift‚Äù.  This is when it does not clap, but smoothly, gradually, the lid rises and falls.  It can reach, depending on the manufacturer, up to completely insane numbers for a seat with a lid: 10, and 15, and 20 thousand. <br><br>  By the way, Villeroy &amp; Boch also has seats with a bidet function.  It looks like, give or take, something like the South Koreans from Daewon. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Villeroy &amp; boch</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/5c2/154/394/5c2154394d2e407ca876ee99dc9457b9.png"><br></div></div><br>  We are not very well versed in plumbing, but if you want some more examples, we have them. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Several Japanese models</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Of course, since the Japanese have begun, then first of all we were looking there.  The most famous brand for us that produces electronic bidets is <a href="https://toshiba.semicon-storage.com/eu/application/consumer/bidet.html">Toshiba</a> . <br><br>  In Russia, the products of this brand are sold much more expensive.  Approximately twice, but on Ebay and Amazon prices are quite adequate.  True, with delivery ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/958/e36/cb3/958e36cb30c341a583c544e5ef404925.png"><br><br>  We have similar products: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/3c4/707/051/3c47070510cf4470b73bb1c5f1e22ccb.png"><br><br>  Of the premium, we also sell bidet caps under the brand TOTO.  One of the models (TOTO F3 TCF 4731) is even more expensive than the "Villeroy": <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/63d/03c/7a2/63d03c7a259e490eaec086d4cef60de1.png"><br><br>  From inexpensive models - the SensPa brand: here the prices for a bidet start from 15 thousand rubles.  In addition to the night illumination in some models, there is no difference in the description. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/091/43f/38f/09143f38fd214430bc1177af1a64d9a7.png"><br><br>  About 30 thousand rubles are Nanobidet models. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/382/d33/53b/382d3353b35640fe92c7ea02a2a284e2.png"><br><br>  There are also cheap Izumi models on the net.  And at the time of this review in the Russian plumbing stores they are in the status of "sold out" for the most part.  The cost there began from 16-17 thousand, as far as managed to recover. <br><br>  And a Roca Multiclin bidet.  Prices for models start at 25,000 rubles and reach - on the same Ebay - up to space 95,000 rubles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/97d/373/f8b/97d373f8b34b463eb9a9cf385c2e013b.png"><br><br>  In fact, it seems that they are all the same.  The magic 30-40-50 functions most often turn out to be marketing: for example, three power saving modes, as in Daewon, are three functions, and not one possibility.  That's all.  All electronic bidets have several options for setting, and the jet itself can come out in different ways.  There is a mark on the brand and details. <br></div></div><br>  In any case, against this background, the <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/daewon-dib-c540.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dbide%26utm_campaign%3D540">cost of the model DIB-540 - 18,900 rubles</a> , albeit plastic, no longer seems so astounding.  And the choice - it will always be, thank God - not the Stone Age. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Coupons</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The supplier company is trying (and thanks to her for this) to align the RRC to these devices, but we were allowed to give an ‚Äúurgent‚Äù coupon. <br><br><ul><li>  Daewon DIB-C500 model - a discount of 2000 rubles on the coupon: <b>ENSL4K</b> (The price with a discount - 13900 rubles) </li><li>  Model Daewon DIB-C540 - discount 2000 rubles coupon: <b>TICCSD</b> (Discounted price - 16900 rubles) </li></ul><br>  Coupons are valid if paid online until May 21, 2017.
