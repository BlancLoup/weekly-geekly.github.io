These resources will allow you to organize the work, check the customer and assess the future prospects of cooperation. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Selection and verification of the employer </h3><br>  So, you have received an offer.  It doesn't matter how you got it or what resource a potential employer refers to - you just need to check it carefully.  To make sure that the employer is in good faith, you can start by reading reviews on specialized portals.  Here are some of the most famous: <br><br>  <a href="http://getsalsa.com/">getsalsa.com</a> <br>  <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/">www.glassdoor.com</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.kununu.com/">www.kununu.com</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.yelp.com/">www.yelp.com</a>

      After verification, it will be advisable to examine the activity of your employer on freelancing exchanges.  It makes sense to contact here: <br><br>  <a href="https://www.upwork.com/">www.upwork.com</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.freelance.com/">www.freelance.com</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.projectlance.com/">www.projectlance.com</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.proz.com/">www.proz.com</a> <br><br><h3>  Determining the level of wages </h3><br>  Before you negotiate terms of cooperation and wages, you need to do a little exploration to find out how much your profile specialists receive in the customer's region.  To monitor the level of wages, you can use the sites with ads for hiring on the "remote". <br><br>  <a href="https://weworkremotely.com/">weworkremotely.com</a> <br>  <a href="https://www.flexjobs.com/">www.flexjobs.com</a> <br>  <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/remote">careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/remote</a> <br>  <a href="https://www.virtualvocations.com/">www.virtualvocations.com</a> <br>  <a href="https://authenticjobs.com/">authenticjobs.com</a> <br>  <a href="https://angel.co/">angel.co</a> <br>  <a href="https://www.staff.com/">www.staff.com</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.skipthedrive.com/">www.skipthedrive.com</a> <br>  <a href="https://dribbble.com/jobs">dribbble.com/jobs</a> <br>  <a href="http://jobs.rubynow.com/">jobs jobsbynow.com</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.skillbridge.co/">www.skillbridge.co</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.guru.com/">www.guru.com</a> <br>  <a href="https://www.themuse.com/jobs">www.themuse.com/jobs</a> <br>  <a href="https://indeed.com/">indeed.com</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.monster.com/">www.monster.com</a> <br><br><h3>  Preparation of contract </h3><br>  Currently, companies from the United States and a number of other countries are increasingly using paperless documents.  Accordingly, documents with electronic signatures are in priority with employers and partners.  If you want to get down to business extremely seriously and protect yourself at all stages, you can use the following tools: <br><br>  <a href="https://www.hellosign.com/">www.hellosign.com</a> <br>  <a href="https://www.pandadoc.com/">www.pandadoc.com</a> <br><br><h3>  Workflow organization </h3><br>  Independence from the place of work creates a lot of temptations, therefore, in order to maintain efficiency, it is necessary to optimize all processes as much as possible.  Below is a list of tools that will help you with this. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.wunderlist.com/ru">www.wunderlist.com/ru</a> is an excellent task scheduler. <br>  <a href="https://trello.com/">trello.com</a> is a service that helps you organize your to-do list. <br>  <a href="https://justgetflux.com/">justgetflux.com</a> is a resource with which you can adapt the monitor screen to the time of day. <br>  <a href="https://slack.com/">slack.com</a> is a group chat that allows you to communicate more effectively in a team and share the necessary files. <br>  <a href="http://hipchat.com/">hipchat.com</a> is another group chat. <br>  <a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword">agilebits.com/onepassword</a> - password manager. <br>  <a href="https://idonethis.com/">idonethis.com</a> is an excellent group task scheduler. <br>  <a href="http://everytimezone.com/">everytimezone.com</a> is a website with which you can easily determine the time in a different time zone. <br>  <a href="https://hackpad.com/">hackpad.com</a> is a great tool to post collective notes. <br>  <a href="https://workfrom.co/">workfrom.co</a> is a resource for finding the best coffee houses for work. <br>  <a href="https://www.getcloudapp.com/">www.getcloudapp.com</a> is a good way to share data from your desktop. <br>  <a href="http://www.spottedbylocals.com/">www.spottedbylocals.com</a> - practical advice from locals for travelers. <br>  <a href="https://www.sqwiggle.com/">www.sqwiggle.com</a> is a convenient service for organizing conferences in a remote group. <br>  <a href="https://hangouts.google.com/">hangouts.google.com</a> - you can use this tool to stay in touch with your remote team. <br>  <a href="https://nozbe.com/ru">nozbe.com/ru</a> - task scheduler for teams. <br>  <a href="http://www.pivotaltracker.com/">www.pivotaltracker.com</a> - a resource that helps to maintain customer feedback at the proper level. <br>  <a href="https://basecamp.com/">basecamp.com</a> - using this site, the remote team is able to solve 1000 tasks in one place. <br>  <a href="http://www.glasscubes.com/">www.glasscubes.com</a> is a service that allows you to manage a remote team in the most efficient way possible. <br>  <a href="https://www.box.com/">www.box.com</a> - file sharing. <br>  <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">www.dropbox.com</a> is one of the most popular file management tools. <br>  <a href="https://docs.google.com/">docs.google.com</a> - a site with which you can organize the sharing of documents in a team. <br>  <a href="https://www.deekit.com/">www.deekit.com</a> is a service for convenient interaction of remote teams. <br><br><h3>  Money management </h3><br>  Freedom implies responsibility, at least for oneself.  Traveling around the world, you must think in advance how and where you will receive cash.

If you pursue this goal from the very beginning, it will be very useful to you first to find out if your employer participates in the program at the invitation of foreign candidates and how often he does it.  It will also be useful to study the resources for visa. <br><br>  <a href="http://blog.sourcing.io/visa-guide">blog.sourcing.io/visa-guide</a> is a visa visa guide for engineers. <br>  <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-visas-and-immigration">www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-visas-and-immigration</a> - you can learn more about working visas to England. <br>  <a href="http://www.myvisajobs.com/Reports/2013-H1B-Visa-Sponsor.aspx">www.myvisajobs.com/Reports/2013-H1B-Visa-Sponsor.aspx</a> - a list of companies that issue visas in the United States. <br><br>  All the variety of tools presented for a specialist working remotely will allow you not only to increase personal effectiveness, but also to expand your horizons.

In this regard, I would like to know your opinion on the following issue: <br><br>  Would you like us to act as intermediaries in concluding contracts of employment between you and potential employers for an additional commission from your salary?  You could conclude a contract with LLC from Russia and conduct a ‚Äúwhite‚Äù activity, and companies from the USA will be more willing to hire employees on a remote basis from Russia. <br><br>  Respectfully, the founder of <a href="http://talentboard.me/candidate">Talentboard.me</a> is <a href="http://talentboard.me/candidate">Arty</a> Smooth. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297510/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297510/</a></p>
