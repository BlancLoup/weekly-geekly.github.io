      I am from a family of three generations of military pilots; we were transferred from city to city, from country to country.  I was born in Ukraine, I grew up in Poland, then we were sent to Siberia, where I graduated from school a little earlier than I had to.  At the age of 15, she entered the university and 4 years later received a diploma from a primary school teacher.  At such a young age, the ‚Äúteacher‚Äù turned out to be so-so out of me, and somehow I was close to Tver, where we had moved from Irkutsk to that time. <br><br>  She arrived in Moscow.  It turned out that there are many opportunities, but nowhere to live.  I learned that there is a magistracy of the Russian Language Institute named after A.S.  Pushkin, where teachers of Russian as a foreign language are trained, on condition that they successfully pass the entrance exams and have a basic philological education, and ‚Äî the key point ‚Äî is provided with a hostel!  6 philologists per year were admitted to the free department.  I did not have a basic philological, but they had a hostel.  This fact has seriously helped me get a basic philological - at home, for two summer months.  I passed the qualification exam in philology, creating a strange precedent, - not philologists had not been torn to them before, - then they were enrolled in the magistracy, well, it started ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5d0/69b/8a8/5d069b8a8dcc49308e46ae6f24fea5c7.jpg"><br><br>  For two years of study in the magistracy fell in love with the profession.  Then there was a free postgraduate department, where only two people per year took 36 people to the site and - with a bonus - provided housing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/53f/ebc/f5f/53febcf5f4c2448aac4a0e42308a4c7e.jpg"><br><br>  And then I came to the interview with the Physics Technician Zhenya Pyshintsev, the founder of the first Russian school for foreigners in Russia, Russian Village School.  After - literally - three or four questions, he hired me.  A few years later, I was "led away" to one of the largest international law firms, where I worked for the next 13 years.  For a change, I took on external projects that always arose somehow unexpectedly ‚Äî I taught Al Jazeera, Voice of America, The Times and Sky News journalists to speak, did full informational support of the Russian part of the U2 world tour, conducted master classes for military translators mentors at the US Department of Defense ... Do not miss! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/502/192/46b/50219246bdf14501bde8a2b8eae1331a.jpg"><br><br>  One of such ‚Äúprojects for a change‚Äù was the training for Acronis in Singapore, where I was asked by the same Yevgeny Pyshmintsev to go for a month: ‚ÄúWe need to help a fellow in Phystech, he needs a Language Trainer.  It's only 4 weeks and it's warm there ... Come on, huh? ‚ÄùI traveled.  She probably did it, because two hours before my departure from Singapore, that same fellow in PhysTech ‚Äî Belousov ‚Äî met me and offered to stay in Acronis.  Apparently, this is Phystech Style - they easily make non-standard decisions.  Honestly, I did not immediately believe that the project ‚ÄúRussian as non-Russian‚Äù could find life in such an unexpected format as an IT company in Singapore ... And Belousov believed.  And this is cool - not every boss is ready to make efforts and seriously invest in projects that, somehow, can be very illusory connected with the efficiency of employees.  But this is a smart approach - people in companies with Russian roots really need to know more about Russia than we all know from the international press.  Yes, and ownership always unites.  Sergey managed to inspire his people with this idea.  Everything turned out the way he saw it - techies teach Russian in Singapore, the Boston office makes lists for the autumn session.  I have 11 students here, they are eager to speak, joyfully greet each other in Russian and ask me about everything that interests them: what we eat (for Singaporeans this is a vital question!), What we think (everything) we rest (where without it), and, of course, as we say.  That's what I'm doing ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/57d/759/4b5/57d7594b5aad469bab2b65f11a0b2eb2.jpg"><br><br>  And I study myself.  On their mistakes and the potential of Acronis.  Ironically, it was here that for the first time I discovered the very gap between understanding that you can lose information and actual confirmation of how it happens.  Learned the word backup.  There was confidence in the future ... What else will be! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/303236/">https://habr.com/ru/post/303236/</a></p>
