    <h4>  Start </h4><br>  It all started back in 1993 by IT standards, when the first conference was held under the name TechEd in Orlando, Florida, USA.  This year, Microsoft presented its new offspring to the conference participants - the Windows 3.1 operating system, which later became super popular.  In addition, the key theme remained the MS DOS operating system, which at that time was at the peak of its popularity.  Among the interesting products of that period, Microsoft Visual Basic can be distinguished, which Microsoft presented shortly before the conference.  Later, Visual Basic will also be a huge success. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  The first TechEd started very seriously - it was visited by 3,000 technical specialists, which came as a surprise even to the organizers.  Dedicated hotel barely coped with the influx of participants.  Many experts came even without prior registration, because it quickly ended.  In general, the first TechEd was a resounding success. <br><br>  The next two conferences of 1994 and 1995 were held in New Orleans, USA, and secured the successful start of the new event.  In 1994, the company already talked about its new project, Windows ‚ÄúChicago‚Äù (future Windows 95), and besides that there were: Windows NT, Access, FoxPro, VBA, Visual C ++, OLE, MAPI, SQL Server and other technologies.  In 1995, the conference broke all records by offering developers more than 400 reports in one event.  TechEd 1995 lasted five days. <br><br>  In 1996, TechEd was held in Los Angeles, bringing together 7000 participants.  This event was opened by Bill Gates himself, then the chairman of the board of directors and CEO of Microsoft.  The theme of the Gates plenary report was the Internet and how it is integrated into the Windows and Windows NT operating systems.  Another major topic of the conference was ActiveX technology. <br><br><img title="image" alt="image" src="http://vyunev.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/image.png?w=254&amp;amp;h=104" width="254" height="104"><img title="image" alt="image" src="http://vyunev.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/image1.png?w=143&amp;amp;h=88" width="143" height="88"><img title="image" alt="image" src="http://vyunev.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/image2.png?w=202&amp;amp;h=123" width="202" height="123"><br><br>  1997 was an important year in the history of TechEd.  First, the conference again took place in Orlando and took place from May 5 to 9, bringing together a record 9,000 participants.  And secondly, the conference took a new step in development - for the first time the European version of the conference was organized under the name TechEd EMEA.  This event took place in the city of Nice, France.  It was attended by 3,700 people.  Bill Gates welcomed the conference participants in a live broadcast. <br><br>  Since 1998, at Microsoft TechEd conferences, Microsoft has been actively promoting Internet technologies: development on ASP, Internet Explorer, DHTML and IIS server.  In 1999, Windows DNA technology was introduced at TechEd, which later transformed into the .NET platform. <br><br>  In 2001, the central topic for discussion at TechEd was the .NET platform, including the server part, the new C # programming language, and the new generation of development tools Visual Studio .NET. <br><br>  In 2002, TechEd North America was held in New Orleans in April.  It was already the tenth anniversary conference of TechEd.  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/ericr/04-10rudderteched.mspx">Eric Radder spoke</a> at the conference this year with a plenary report on the new product of Visual Studio .NET, which was launched a little earlier in 2002. <br><br>  In 2003, a new Windows Storage Server 2003 product was announced at a conference in Dallas, a new version of SQL Server, codenamed Yukon, and a second version of the .NET Framework were discussed. <br><br>  2004 was the year of the next generation of Windows discussion, codenamed Longhorn. <br><br>  TechEd 2008, which was already held under the TechEd North America brand, was remembered for a historic event - the last performance of Bill Gates on behalf of Microsoft, who told about the company's plans to develop data centers and about the new Windows 7 operating system. <br><br>  Since 2008, thanks to the Channel9 portal, everyone has the opportunity to view TechEd conference reports videos online.  Video reports from the following TechEd conferences are available at <a title="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd" href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd">http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd</a> : <ul><li>  <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica">Tech ¬∑ Ed North America</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/Africa">Tech ¬∑ Ed Africa</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/Australia">Tech ¬∑ Ed Australia</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NewZealand">Tech ¬∑ Ed New Zealand</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/MiddleEast">Tech ¬∑ Ed Middle East</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/Europe">Tech ¬∑ Ed Europe</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/China">Tech ¬∑ Ed China</a> </li></ul>  The next <a href="http://northamerica.msteched.com/default.aspx">TechEd North America 2012</a> conference will be held in June 2012 in the city of Orlando, USA. <br><br><h4>  Our days </h4><br>  Today, Central TechEd North America is a giant event gathering thousands of attendees.  The TechEd NA 2011 conference brought together 10,000 specialists from 84 countries from around the world to listen to over 500 technical sessions and reports and to participate in 250 laboratory work. <br><br>  Interesting announcements of some of the latest TechEd events: <ul><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/microsoft/74745/">TechEd Europe 2009</a> - a new generation of Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 has been released, a preliminary version of SQL Server 2008 R2 has become available, </li><li>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/bobmuglia/apr10/06-7teched2010.mspx%3Frss_fdn%3DCustom">TechEd North America 2010</a> - a preliminary version of Windows 7 SP1, Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 and Exchange Server 2010 SP1 has been released, announcements of the development of Windows Azure, details of Communications Server ‚Äú14‚Äù are disclosed. </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/microsoft/107770/">TechEd Europe 2010</a> - the launch of the <a title="Cloud power" href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud/">Cloud Power</a> initiative is announced, the Hyper-V Cloud project is launched, the Hyper-V Cloud Fast Track is launched, the preview version of Forefront Endpoint Protection 2010 is launched in conjunction with Dell, Fujitsu, Hitachi, HP, IBM and NEC; </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/microsoft/blog/119577/">TechEd North America 2011</a> - for the first time the details of the new version of Visual Studio were opened, which will replace the 2010 version, numerous extensions of Windows Azure cloud services were announced, release dates were announced, and preliminary versions of new versions of the products were made available: SQL Server Denali, WP7, Hyper- V, System Center 2012. </li></ul><br><h4>  Regional Conferences </h4><br><h4><img title="image" alt="image" src="http://vyunev.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/image5.png?w=228&amp;amp;h=100" width="228" height="100"><img title="image" alt="image" src="http://vyunev.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/image6.png?w=178&amp;amp;h=89" width="178" height="89"><img title="image" alt="image" src="http://vyunev.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/image7.png?w=192&amp;amp;h=100" width="192" height="100"><img title="image" alt="image" src="http://vyunev.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/image8.png?w=155&amp;amp;h=68" width="155" height="68"><img title="image" alt="image" src="http://vyunev.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/image9.png?w=163&amp;amp;h=103" width="163" height="103"><img title="image" alt="image" src="http://vyunev.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/image10.png?w=200&amp;amp;h=94" width="200" height="94"><img title="image" alt="image" src="http://vyunev.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/image11.png?w=209&amp;amp;h=94" width="209" height="94"><img title="image" alt="image" src="http://vyunev.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/image13.png?w=181&amp;amp;h=100" width="181" height="100"><img title="image" alt="image" src="http://vyunev.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/image14.png?w=256&amp;amp;h=100" width="256" height="100"></h4><br><br><h5>  TechEd EMEA / Europe </h5><br>  Since 1997, the holding of a conference of the European version of TechEd EMEA has become almost annual.  Conferences were held in 1998 (Nice), 1999 and 2000 (Amsterdam), 2003 (Barcelona), 2004 and 2005 (Amsterdam), 2006-2008 (Barcelona) and in 2009 and 2010 TechEd EMEA were held in Berlin. <br><br>  In 2011, TechEd Europe took a break to return in 2012.  From 25 to 29 June, the next <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/europe/teched/">TechEd Europe 2012</a> will be held in Amsterdam. <br><br>  In 2003, TechEd took another step and the conference expanded significantly as new countries entered the new continent.  This time Australia, India and Israel got their TechEd. <br><br><h5>  TechEd Australia, TechEd New Zealand </h5><br>  The Australian version of the largest conference for IT professionals began its history in 2003 in Brisburn, Australia.  After that, the annual Australian versions of TechEd were held in the cities of Canberra (2004), Gold Coast (2005, 2007, 2009, 2010) and Sydney (2006, 2008). <br><br>  Together with the Australian conference, a conference was held annually in neighboring New Zealand.  TechEd New Zealand events almost always took place in Auckland, New Zealand.  In 2010, dozens of reports were presented at the TechEd New Zealand conference. <br><br>  At the end of August 2011, <a href="http://australia.msteched.com/">TechEd Australia 2011</a> will be held next <a href="http://newzealand.msteched.com/default.aspx">TechEd New Zealand 2011</a> , and in early September. <br><br><h5>  TechEd India </h5><br>  TechEd India began its history in 2003.  Since then, the conference became held annually, with the exception in 2008, when the conference was not held. <br><br>  In 2009, Steve Ballmer spoke at TechEd India and this was Ballmer's first speech at the TechEd Regional Conference outside the United States.  In 2009, the conference offered visitors 28 technical tracks with 112 reports and 24 laboratory work. <br><br>  The last Indian event was held in March 2011 in Bangalore, India. <br><br><h5>  TechEd Israel </h5><br>  The first TechEd Israel conference held in 2003 in the city of Eilat gathered 1,500 people.  TechEd Israel 2010 was held in November 2010 and gathered more than 3,000 people. The main topics of the conference were Office 365, Lync, and SharePoint 2010 technologies. <br><br>  In 2005, TechEd Conference once again increased its geographic presence ‚Äî an African version of TechEd Africa was launched. <br><br><h5>  TechEd Africa </h5><br>  TechEd Africa Conference (until 2007 it was called TechEd South Africa) was another international analogue of the original TechEd, which has recently been named TechEd North America.  For the first time African TechEd was held in 2005 in the city of Sun City, South Africa.  In the following 2006 and 2007, the conference was held in the same place in Sun City, but from 2008 to 2010 the TechEd Africa venue was changed to Durban, South Africa. <br><br>  In 2011, October <a href="https://secure.mseventssa.co.za/TechEd2011MailingList/">17-20</a> , <a href="https://secure.mseventssa.co.za/TechEd2011MailingList/">TechEd Africa 2011</a> will re-open its doors in the city of Durban. <br><br><h5>  TechEd Middle East </h5><br>  These two conferences are the newest conferences held by TechEd.  First, in March 2010, TechEd Middle East Middle East Conference was held in Dubai, UAE, and then in September 2010, South American TechEd Latin America was held in Sao Paulo, Brazil. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.teched.ae/">TechEd Middle East 2011</a> was held in March 2011 in Dubai. <br><br>  The TechEd story does not end there.  In 2011, the brand will be expanded again.  In the arena of the world's largest events for IT professionals will be a new conference called TechEd Russia. <br><br><h5>  More TechEd </h5><br>  In addition to the listed conferences in the world of the TechEd brand, there are even more geographical locations.  These are TechEd China, TechEd Japan, TechEd Brasil (aka TechEd Latina America).  Virtually the entire world is covered by the TechEd conference, which annually hosts tens of thousands of professionals around the world. <br><br>  And I am very pleased that in 2011 this large family of conferences will be replenished with another country (and in fact the whole region) - Russia. <br><br><h4>  TechEd Russia </h4><br> <i><a href="http://www.msteched.ru/"><img title="logo" alt="logo" src="http://vyunev.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/logo.png?w=234&amp;amp;amp;h=130"></a></i> <br><br>  On November 9-10, 2011, the first international conference <a href="http://www.msteched.ru/">Tech <b>‚àô</b> Ed Russia 2011</a> will be held in Moscow.
