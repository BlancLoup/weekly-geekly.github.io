  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why Microsoft buys Skype for $ 8.5 billion</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Updated at 9:00 MSK: Microsoft bought Skype for $ 8.5 billion. The deal closed several hours ago.  The Wall Street Journal <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703730804576313932659388852.html%3Fmod%3DdjemalertNEWS">confirmed the</a> news after <a href="http://gigaom.com/2011/05/08/more-skype-rumors-big-news-soon-microsoft-in-the-mix/">we first reported it yesterday</a> .  The official statement, according to different versions, should follow later today or tomorrow morning.  Steve Ballmer, executive director of Microsoft, is considered the main person behind this transaction, the largest in the history of the company.  A few hours later, Ballmer and Skype CEO Tony Bates will hold a press conference. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Skype has already been offered for sale several times thanks to <i>some very nervous investors</i> .  My sources say that both eBay and Silver Lake Partners were nervous about the delay in accessing the stock exchange and trying to initiate the sale of Skype.  Previously, it was reported that negotiations were underway with Facebook and Google, while Microsoft appeared later and is now close to picking up the top prize. <br><br>  I won‚Äôt be surprised if Microsoft is strongly criticized for deciding to buy Skype - and the software company can always spoil everything, as she often did after buying other companies.  The Skype development team is also full of employees who are more likely to look for another place than to deal with the famous Maykrosoft bureaucracy. <br><br>  I also do not believe that Facebook and Google were serious buyers.  Google has a Google Voice product, so it doesn't really need Skype.  Essentially, I have a feeling that Microsoft was bargaining with itself.  Even so, I personally think that the purchase is worth the money spent, especially for a company that has been on the sidelines for so long. <br><ul><li>  Skype gives Microsoft acceleration in the enterprise collaboration software market, thanks to voice and video services, especially in competition with Cisco and Google. </li><li>  Microsoft also gains access to telecom operators, many of whom are seeking partnerships with Skype in the light of the transition to LTE networks. </li><li>  Microsoft gets a very popular application and service that will add popularity to future versions of the Windows Mobile operating system. </li><li>  However, the <b>most important reason for buying Skype</b> is Windows Phone 7 (mobile OS) and Nokia.  The software giant must offer something competitive compared to Google Voice and Apple Facetime. </li></ul>  <b>Who wins the most</b> <br>  Facebook can be the biggest beneficiary of this deal.  The owners of the largest social network had almost no chance to get Skype.  If he went to the stock exchange, then everything would be over.  With a Microsoft owner, they get everything they need - and access to the assets of Skype (Microsoft is an investor in Facebook), and a guarantee that Skype will stay away from Google.

      Facebook critically needs Skype.  Among other things, they need to use the Skype peering network to transfer video and voice in the Facebook Chat integrated chat.  If the company tried to use traditional methods to organize such a multimedia service for 600+ million of its users, the cost of supporting the infrastructure would be excessive. <br><br>  Facebook can also help Skype to expand the number of users of a paid service SkypeOut, and people can pay in local currency Facebook Credits to pay for minutes.  Skype and Facebook are already working on a joint application, and you can expect it soon. <br><br>  <b>Why did Skype want to sell?</b> <br>  Skype applied for an IPO, was about to raise billions of dollars on the open market and was on its way to profitability.  So why sell?  Both the largest investors ‚Äî Silver Lake and eBay ‚Äî were already losing patience and were eager to take their profits as soon as possible.  Other sources also claim that Skype‚Äôs earnings have stopped growing. <br><br>  The company has put a lot on its video conferencing service.  The premium version of this service was supposed to be a way for Skype to increase the average revenue per user and enter the corporate market.  However, given the reputation of Skype as a free Internet product for the masses, the difficulties here were not a surprise. <br><br>  <b>Who earned how much?</b> <ul><li>  If you take $ 8.5 billion in sales value, then eBay receives $ 2.55 billion for 30% of its shares.  So the output of eBay was even in the black. </li><li><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/b52f1ae1/f9ab5bb6/cdb0bcd1/6e14d4ca.gif" align="right">  Niklas Zennstr√∂m and Janus Friis, co-founders with their 14% stake, will take home <b>about $ 1.19 billion</b> .  Yes, these guys know how to double the capital! </li><li>  Silver Lake, Andreessen Horowitz and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) own 56% of the company's shares and it costs $ 4.76 billion. </li><li>  Andreessen Horowitz owned a 3% stake and received $ 205 million in profit on his initial investment of $ 50 million. </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/118980/">https://habr.com/ru/post/118980/</a></p>
