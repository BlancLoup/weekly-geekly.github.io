      97% of consumers say that when it comes to brand loyalty, customer service is a very important factor.  So let's see how you can take negative commentators as a bridle and turn them into loyal and loyal customers. <br><br>  <b>1. <u>Respond to negative comments quickly.</u></b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d01/1ab/b52/d011abb5255443c9a5207a38aec6e777.jpg"><br><br>  After you see a new negative review, the <b>speed of response should be prioritized.</b>  You can't just ignore them.  No matter how much you want them to disappear, they won't disappear.  We must make every effort to resolve the problem, which is discussed in the comments. <br><br>  In no case <b>should</b> <b>negative comments</b> <b>be deleted</b> , because such your actions will make the customers angry and they will turn away from you completely.  This also applies to ignoring their opinions.  The only exception when a review can still be deleted is its absolute inappropriateness.  <b><i>If you suspect that your reviewer is a troll, then the best way is to do nothing, as he will not look for a real solution to the current situation.</i></b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d2b/ec0/9ba/d2bec09ba1ba4d66961dfdb1c95ad4ec.jpg"><br><br>  This is how your response should be, not a negative review or comment: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Immediate.</b>  If your client is upset or furious, you need to contact him as soon as possible.  Do not allow 24 hours from posting a review to a response. </li><li>  <b>Open</b>  You must adequately assess the shortcomings of your company and openly respond to negative comments.  This is a great opportunity not only to show the client that he is important to you and take responsibility for his mistakes, but also to demonstrate that you are a responsible owner of your business, who values ‚Äã‚Äãdecency and transparency. </li><li>  <b>Professional.</b>  Negative reviews are painful and unpleasant to hear, especially when you have invested so much time and effort in your business.  Responding to reviews, keep calm, do not succumb to hysteria and do not shift the blame.  Never make excuses or insult customers, but rather be polite and courteous. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>2. <u>Put yourself in the shoes of customers.</u></b> <br><br>  Empathy, or empathy is very important during responses to comments from disgruntled customers.  By putting yourself in their place, you will not only be able to correctly formulate the answer, but also receive a guarantee that customers will feel that their opinions are heard and appreciated. <br><br>  A lot of people are lazy by nature, and you can only write negative feedback by making efforts.  If the person did this, then he really had a bitter experience with your business. <br><br>  In order to understand the status of the client, remember how you saw the message delivery error on the mobile, how you turned off the site while you were working or when the food delivery service was late, and remember your feelings at that moment. <br><br>  <b>3. <u>Apologize and suggest solutions</u></b> <br><br>  Apology is an important link in building a correct and effective response.  Apologizing, let the client know that you are very sorry that he had to feel and experience this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a3a/d61/3bc/a3ad613bc3d748dab5c39279b52597ab.png"><br><br>  As a business owner, you are responsible for every experience of your customers, whether it is positive or negative.  By taking steps to address the current situation, you will gain respect, trust and a positive reputation. <br><br>  <b>Identify the source of the problem and offer to solve it in the most appropriate way for the client.</b>  If the product is defective, offer to replace it;  if you have any problems processing your order - offer a discount as compensation;  if someone is not satisfied with the quality of the purchased product as a whole - make a full refund. <br><br>  If, after all, the problem was not resolved, leave your contact details to the client.  So he will feel your responsibility and reliability. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/482/1e8/53e/4821e853e37c49cf80837ad021b542d7.png"><br><br>  <b>4. <u>Plan for the future</u></b> <br><br>  If the buyer has some unpleasant buying situation, do not despair!  Find out all the details and make a clear plan for the future in order to avoid such a problem.  Negative reviews are incentives to be better! <br><br>  <b>5. <u>Receive more positive feedback.</u></b> <br><br>  Positive feedback has a huge impact on the company.  They improve SEO and increase conversion.  Therefore, it is worth paying attention not only to negative reviews, but also positive ones, since many buyers do not leave feedback after purchase. <br><br>  <b>There are several ways to get positive feedback from customers:</b> <br><br>  <u>Use video content</u> .  Users love to watch videos and statistics YouTube, spend <a href="http://expandedramblings.com/index.php/youtube-statistics/">6 billion</a> hours per month to watch it.  It brings pleasure, and therefore positive feedback.  Do video reviews, product crash tests, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d13/1ff/e08/d131ffe08c5f45f385d71d553fbd61de.png"><br><br>  <u>Communities in social networks.</u>  Attract customers to join your groups or communities on various social networks.  Personally communicate with customers and carefully monitor their activity to prevent discussions on the wall from getting out of your control.  Regular monitoring of comments will help you not only to minimize all damage from a negative feedback, but also just to keep abreast of the audience. <br><br>  <u>Ask customers to leave feedback.</u>  Identify those customers who have long been using your services or buying goods, and have a positive experience with you.  Then write them a personal letter asking for feedback.  Be 99% sure that the client will not give you a negative review and only then appeal to him. <br><br>  We hope that after reading the article, the fear of negative reviews disappeared, because now you know how to work with them, how to impress your customers and get a response. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299016/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299016/</a></p>
