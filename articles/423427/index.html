And no, I AM NOT AN IDEA-GUY ... Most of you use a different set of information resources, such as Ludum Dare, Gamedev.net, Indie Game Developers (and other Facebook groups), Unity Connect, IndieDb , Itch.io, Game Jolt, etc.  What if we could come together to create a centralized place where you could stay to share information about game development or be redirected to the external resource mentioned above? <br><br>  NO, I do not want the type of 50-on-50, and you do all the work.  I already do it!  Absolutely right!  With or without you guys.  I could only use some help from the game development community. <br></blockquote><p>  So what is the essence of IndieVisible? </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  Here is my free translation of the document that is offered for discussion and implementation. </p><br><h1 id="chto-eto">  What is it </h1><br><p>  An online community of indie developers built on an open source platform.

Anyone can join the development process, and the most active participants will have more privileges in the platform itself. </p><br><p>  The proposed development platform is .NET Core, chosen for the following reasons: </p><br><ul><li>  Using C # because  C # is widely used in game devs, especially in the Unity Engine; </li><li>  Frontend can be executed using javascript.  JavaScript is widely used as a frontend language, and Angular allows you to create a rich user interface; </li><li>  Runs on any OS: </li><li>  Open source; </li></ul><br><p>  Fundamental rules: </p><br><ol><li>  The API must be implemented for internal use and extended in the future for external use; </li><li>  All URLs must have a ‚Äúlang‚Äù parameter for future localization. </li></ol><br><h2 id="monetizaciya">  Monetization </h2><br><p>  The basis of monetization is a button for collecting donations.
