There I wrote about the development process, mainly about people.  This article will be devoted to the realities of the site in the network, specific figures of income and expenditure, references to the site and attendance. <br><br>  <b>Start</b> <br><br>  So, the project Holivars.ru launched.  Launched successfully, he called a shot.  This is when the news about the project is carried by itself by people whom it impressed.  After the publication of reviews only on Habr√© and another resource, without investing money in advertising - more than a thousand mentions in the blogosphere, a dozen mentions on news sites, even stories on TV, which made our hair bulge and our eyes stood on end - on Expert-TV and Teleport on MTV. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Attendance</b>

      <br>
      The most visited days in the history of the project were the first days of the publication of reviews and the active mention of our project in blogs, especially Twitter.  On the first and second day we were visited by 5,000 people, to which, as it turned out, we were not technically ready - many potential visitors were lost due to the fact that the server was overloaded.  By approximate estimations, we lost 2000 potential visitors because of our mistake, and when we put the site on a powerful server, such an influx did not happen again - but I still had a deposit on the important launch day. <br><br>  Probably, it will be interesting to find out what is the arrival of visitors from the references to the TV?  From MTV, where 2 minutes of airtime were devoted to us and a link hung on the site for a week, about 4,000 unique users arrived during the week.  From the mention on Expert TV about 1000. Not so much, the blogosphere gave a dozen times more. <br><br>  What gave us such great popularity in the first months of work?  Everything is not so happy as we would like.  First of all, only 1 out of 10 returns from users for the second time. And those who stayed more than a week can be divided by another 10. As a result, now the resource‚Äôs attendance floats around 900 visitors per day, dropping to 800 from time to time. <br><br>  <b>Resource type</b> <br><br>  But our example of attendance is certainly not universal.  Each resource will have its own dependence of the remaining people and the number of those who come from the same type of advertising medium.  I'll try to sort through the success of the site Holivars.ru <br><br>  Firstly, the non-standard design, for the majority of those who saw it for the first time, caused a small wow-effect.  I think that this is one of the key reasons why the project was fired when there were already its analogues.  He does not have such original functionality, and only a non-standard vision of the design helped spread links to the site in thousands of blogs and microblogging.  Perhaps developers should think that a standard portal design is so widely spread that a non-standard vision can be great to attract people to you, to be the key to success. <br><br>  But this is about success, and now about proser.  Our site has such a feature that it is banal to argue and tiresome to argue.  The second is that the topics for dispute are exhaustive.  After the first month of using the site, I myself began to leave comments there less and less often, let alone ordinary users.  And the same feelings were in other team members.  But our situation is not unique, the same fate, or even worse, is waiting for the majority of entertainment services, such as snowflakes cutters and the substitution of people's photos on other people's faces.  Active Internet audience quickly diminishes, giving each other links to the resource, makes fun of a couple of days and leaves.  If nothing forces them to remain on the site, then even transcendental popularity is worth nothing in monetary terms.  If only PR was for you, I used to do this kind of prikolyukha - yes, I remember, it was a notable thing. <br><br>  Everything is not as bad as some services - we have some stability, we have plans to diversify the site and fit more people into it.  But, frankly, we don‚Äôt think about the prospect of a large 5,000 users per day - and that‚Äôs very little in the money, which will be discussed further. <br><br>  <b>Expenses</b> <br><br>  To begin, I note how much was spent.  It took 25,000 rubles to a beautiful domain, about 6 thousand went to pay for the work of the programmer to finalize the project and there was still so much left to the final look of the site.  Not so much, if we also consider that we have divided the domain purchase into 2 people - again, the advantages of a large team, where not everyone will have money, but some will be able to fold. <br><br>  Was it possible to do without a beautiful domain?  This is a difficult question, I think a beautiful domain is still a big plus.  When you see a good website with a domain design.ru, then you unwittingly take it more seriously than if it was called design-moskva.net.  This, in turn, was one of the components of the popularity of the project at first, as I believe. <br><br>  On the other hand, if the site has unique functions or content that is interesting to users, then let it be called at least lleo.aha.ru, it will still be bookmarked and will be read by 100 thousand people.  But we can not boast of such. <br><br>  <b>Income</b> <br><br>  Now the most interesting thing is that we can fuck with all this in monetary terms?  Almost nothing.  If you now connect with banner networks that will run for example a 240x400 banner on our website, then we will be able to earn about 50 rubles per day from one such banner.  Those.  we can buy a loaf of bread and 200 grams of smoked sausage, then divide it into 4 project participants ‚Äî stare at the table and dine modestly, interrupting for deep sighs. <br><br>  The calculation here is this - for 1000 page views, an average of 8 clicks occur (this is optimistic, sometimes less).  Our stable 800-900 visitors per day form about 7000 page views and accordingly make about 55 clicks.  Banner networks often work on the principle of pay per click, where one click can cost a maximum of 1 ruble.  Total, we get 55 clicks and 55 rubles for them.  The prices I round a little, they can vary, but you can imagine about the volumes.  We, for example, for the sake of such a profit of 1700 / month will not spoil the look of the site with a large banner. <br><br>  Contextual advertising has almost the same income.  It has a feature about which they have written more than once in similar articles - regular visitors hardly ever click it.  If the graphic banner is able to attract them, users remember the text areas with advertisements and do not intuitively notice them.  Ad blind, there is such a thing in overseas lands.  As a result, in most cases, people click on contextual advertising who come to the site from search engines - they were looking for something and saw the object of their searches in the contextual advertising block - click.  Those.  if your site rises high on popular requests, then you can earn even more than on banner networks. <br><br>  The most realistic method of income from the site has so far been direct sales of banner places.  Those.  when you are contacted by a specific company wishing to place a banner on your website or you find such people yourself.  Here, for a small flash banner 200x300, which almost does not spoil the appearance of the site - 2 400 rubles per month.  If we take into account that you can put 2 such banners, and the attendance will reach 5,000 per day - we will be able to earn 24,000 per month, which means 6,000 per team member.  This is far from a good profit, but you can already buy a 3 liter jar of pumpkin juice for sausage and bread. <br><br>  Also, there is a project purchase option.  Sometimes, similar to our services, they buy some giants with giblets.  But considering the time and effort invested, I personally would not agree to a sum of less than 7 digits - after all, divide into four more.  And such a good offer is unlikely to come. <br><br>  Total, the balance is still -31000 rubles, +2400 rubles from advertising.  I think that in 6-10 months all costs will be paid back, if attendance does not fall sharply.  But the project will remain only an interesting experience that does not bring real profit.  The main thing that this experience was interesting, and he was just that. <br><br>  <b>Who earns</b> <br><br>  I can say as an insider.  Well, for example, they make money on banal sites with entertainment and porn content, there is a large percentage of the remaining people, they are not crowded there, and you can hang a large number of banners right away.  But it's not that simple.  For this business do not interfere even a dozen satellites - sites that people will go on search queries, but the site itself will be simple and its main task will be to redirect traffic to the channel you need.  Someone has to search and post content, someone has to keep track of new popular queries and raise the site in search engines - you have to share.  But even without that, incomes there can be good, really bring attendance to 50,000 per day, and in a compartment with a dozen banners this is already from 300,000 rubles per month. <br><br>  But for this kind of work you probably need a special character, because you have to deal with a boring affair.  I have to work in this area as a subordinate, but I want to break out of it, there is little room for innovation.  So far I can not afford this, but perhaps having done a few more projects I can cover at least the current ZP.  and leave work in the sphere of free internet. <br><br>  <b>Results</b> <br><br>  I would like to write more results and tips, but nothing special to summarize.  I hope this article will simply help to navigate the realities of the Internet, someone will be mentally prepared for small profits, and maybe someone will decide to start their project on the enthusiasm of our example.  Good luck to everyone and thank you for your attention. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/67554/">https://habr.com/ru/post/67554/</a></p>
