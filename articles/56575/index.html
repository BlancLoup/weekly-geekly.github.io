Is it possible to order icons for your project ‚Äúthanks‚Äù?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  So I decided to debut on Habr'e. <br><br>  Will the professionals agree to make icons for free, or can beginners be able to make icons as good as professionals? <br>  Over the course of a year, I develop <a href="http://infostart.ru/projects/1697/">the Personal Finance Management</a> project <a href="http://infostart.ru/projects/1697/">(ULFIN)</a> for 1C: Enterprise 8. This product is distributed free of charge, and I do it in my free time.  Judging by the rating and reviews - people like it.  But there is a minus of this: there is no finance for the development of the project, therefore, the Internet was searched for beauty in search of icons for the project and what was found was inserted.  It turned out beautifully, but the idea that it would be necessary to legalize the icons, does not give rest, and everything was going to draw them yourself.  Then I realized that it is impossible to embrace immensely - my business is programming (well, I still had the patience to start studying CMS to raise the site (in progress)), but let those who can do it develop icons. <br><br>  And then, one fine day, an idea appears in my head: to make an offer to companies that professionally develop icons, but ask them to do it for free.  The first results ... 
      <br>

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The whole idea was to somehow interest the company to make the icons ‚Äúwithout funding‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Step 1:</b> Search engines have found several companies that develop icons.  I looked through their work, selected for the start 3 companies whose works I liked the most. <br><br>  <b>Step 2: I</b> created a letter in the Word in which I briefly described my project, its further development, what I want and what I offer. <br>  What I could offer them: to place information about them, as about the creators of icons on your website and advertising block in your program.  And yet, the fact that a project is possible after some time will branch off into a commercial branch, and then I will be ready to finance the creation of icons.  At the same time, I honestly admitted that a product would go to a commercial branch or not - this is a question, so it‚Äôs better not to count on it.  References to the text at the end will cite. <br><br>  <b>Step 3:</b> Suggestions have been sent to selected companies.  Were chosen fairly large players in this market, because  the goal was not to spam all the offices with their proposal, but to select the ones you like.  Honesty - we go this way <br><br>  <b>Step 4:</b> With all this process, the girl offered to post more ads on freelance sites.  What was done.  The free-lans.ru ad was deleted after 5-10 minutes (why? Until they answered me, maybe because I gave a link to my project. But I gave it for one purpose - to show what the project is about). <br>  But fortunately, I managed to get 3 responses from users ready to help me.  They also have their own benefits - to expand their portfolio. <br>  I received 3 more responses on other similar site.  There is no subject removed. <br><br>  <b>Step 5: I</b> wrote a technical assignment - in which I led screenshots of my program, and offered to draw a couple of icons in order to understand what style they see them, adjust, select one and continue to work.  All responding was sent teh.zadanie. <br><br>  Now the first samples from freelancers have begun to arrive, unfortunately so far all is not that.  But here I consider myself to blame.  It is necessary to describe in more detail what I want.  What I will do, I will think more specifically about what should be depicted. <br><br>  As for professional companies.  To date, 2 responses out of three have been received.  One company became interested in the offer, but refused due to the lack of free employees, but put a note (I hope it is), the second company did not find the offer so attractive. <br><br>  Results: it is too early to let them down, this is just the beginning.  If the topic is interesting, I will keep up to date. <br>  Perhaps someone from the Habrochiteli this proposal, I am ready to listen to all your suggestions. <br><br>  Links to files: <br>  - <a href="">Offer to companies. Zip</a> (the same letter that was sent to firms) <br>  - <a href="">Terms of Reference.zip</a> (first draft <a href="">technical specifications</a> for those interested) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/56575/">https://habr.com/ru/post/56575/</a></p>
