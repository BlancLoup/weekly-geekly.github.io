You should strive to get as many ‚Äúideal‚Äù customers as possible.  The ideal customer is the one that gets the most out of your product or service. </li><li>  Activation.  The fact that a customer has come into contact with your business does not mean that he will buy your product.  This is especially true of the world of online services: if a person wants to use the test version, this does not mean that you caught him.  Your task is to ensure that each user actually performs a targeted action that turns him into an active client.  If you put the need to activate customers to one of the first places to achieve goals, it will increase your chances of keeping them. </li><li>  Reanimation.  Even if you got the "right" customers and quickly activated them, it is extremely important to continue to monitor those who become inactive and invite them to come back, persuade them to use your product or make another purchase. </li></ol><br>  To maximize the retention rate, you have to spend a lot of time convincing customers not to leave. <br>  One of the most effective methods of customer retention is sending out achievement letters. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  <b>What are letters of achievement?</b> </h4><br>  Achievement letters are letters that are sent on a regular basis with statistics on user activity and can be used for all types of products. <br><br>  A great example is the <b>Grammarly</b> letter of achievement.  They have made email newsletters the basis for their client communication strategy: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7f0/1be/7b7/7f01be7b7b584f18986a9c303bc7ab7d.png"><br><br>  In this achievement letter, customers receive all the data on their activity.  With the help of a personal report, Grammarly users can track their progress, and praise is the correct feedback, which acts as an incentive for further action.  Such letters help open doors to a wide target audience. <br><br>  <i>Here are a couple of great examples of personalized achievement letters:</i> <br><br>  <b>SumoMe</b> is a program that improves the traffic of your site.  Every week they send statistics on the performance of services to attract traffic to the client's site: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/426/710/6ce/4267106ce2604c8ca41df55d1577616b.jpg"><br><br>  SumoMe indicates how much performance has decreased over the week and immediately offers solutions to these problems (you can increase the number of subscribers using Scroll Box Pro, and in order to know as many people as possible about your site, it offers to share this information on Twitter) thereby causing customer trust <br><br>  <b>Kazeli</b> is nothing more than a business directory site.  The platform hosts thousands of accounts of various companies and services.  And they also send statistics with customer results: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9bc/c78/202/9bcc7820260547eca59b4d368bbc6697.jpg"><br><br>  We at <a href="https://sendpulse.com/">SendPulse</a> also try to always emphasize the importance of customer results: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d51/691/7ee/d516917eeae44b729e862d56fbf16bfd.jpg"><br><br>  The bottom line is that people are egocentric in nature.  The more companies or brands talk about themselves, the higher the likelihood of re-accessing and moving into the category of regular users / customers. <br><br><h4>  <b>Tips for creating achievement letters:</b> </h4><br><ul><li>  Evaluate achievement letters as part of your product, not a marketing ploy.  Such an understanding will change the effectiveness of your mailing for the better, from the headline, the main essence and ending with the functionality and utility. </li><li>  Start with the simplest.  For example, from usage reports or digests.  They will be a good start to retain customers and at the same time require the cohesive work of your team.  You will need to track user data from external APIs or web feeds.  This process will require interaction between developers and marketers, which will make your writing an integral part of an online strategy. </li><li>  Strive to achieve positive customer feedback. </li></ul><br>  For clients, achievement letters act as a motivator for further accomplishments.  Here the main role is played by the human factor.  After all, we all like to be successful when our work is noticed and encouraged.  Achievement letters, which describe success, bring positive emotions to clients and, at a subconscious level, trigger an activation mechanism in order to move and develop further.  And all your services are developed only with customers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0fd/fb5/0de/0fdfb50de3bf480da3172f090ba074e8.jpg">  Konstantin Makarov, CEO of the <a href="https://sendpulse.com/">SendPulse</a> mailing <a href="https://sendpulse.com/">service</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294952/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294952/</a></p>
