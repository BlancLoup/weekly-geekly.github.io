  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Financial planning: sharing experience</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In yesterday's article, <a href="http://rauf.livejournal.com/437136.html">I wrote about the release development management plan template</a> . <br><br>  Today I will talk about the department‚Äôs financial plan in its most basic form.  Everyone can, taking it as a basis, do something different. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We begin, as always, with goals and objectives. <br><br>  The purpose of the financial plan is to estimate the expenses on the wage fund for the coming year in the context of the department controlled by you.  Since this is a plan, the key word is to evaluate.  For simplicity, taxes are not included in the plan template, as this is a rather specific topic for each company.  However, it is quite easy to make a tax plan out of a tax-free plan.

      // I do not touch on any other items of expenditure except for the payroll, since  I do not want to mix everything in one pile.  Perhaps I will write about this separately. <br><br>  What tasks do we solve using such a plan? <br><ul><li>  We get an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe order of expenses on the wage fund in the context of your department; </li><li>  We fix these figures with the financial director or your immediate supervisor or CEO; </li><li>  We get data for the personnel department and the supply department - how many people will be at what point, which will allow them to plan jobs, as well as their own time (all of a sudden you have explosive growth in May!); </li><li>  We obtain data on average salaries for posts - it will allow us to estimate how much each salary of your employee differs from the average for this position; </li><li>  and much more. </li></ul><br><br>  Unlike the release development management plan, this template is full of formulas and they really make it easier to update during the year.  Therefore, the requirements for spreadsheets are higher: MS Excel is desirable, it may not work in open office. <br><br>  So, what are the blocks in the plan: <br><ul><li>  bookmark with common words about the plan (tab "Help") </li><li>  Actually monthly plan in the context of months and positions (tab "Finplan by department") </li><li>  List of employees (tab "Staff list") </li><li>  Directory of positions and departments (tab "Positions and departments") </li></ul><br><br>  Let's start from the end.  First you need to update the directory of posts and departments for your business.  Each position and department is associated with a code, which then appears in other tables. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cae/d8c/a2e/caed8ca2ef006bc87c122ef2d78f3d55.png"><br><br>  <i>Will add new lines - try to insert them in the middle, but not at the end or at the beginning.</i>  <i>In general, there is everywhere ‚Äúprotection from a fool‚Äù, but suddenly I forgot where.</i>  <i>Otherwise, a set of rows that are viewed by other tables may float away.</i>  <i>For example, if summation in Excel went A1-A10, then adding the eleventh line to the sum will not turn on.</i>  <i>This applies to all other tables.</i>  <i>Therefore, I always try to capture an extra empty line in the ranges, just in case.</i> <br><br>  Secondly, you need to update the posts: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a76/874/dbb/a76874dbb71e72306bb842bb39e64f93.png"><br><br>  One of the columns, as can be seen from the figure, has the style "oblique font."  Hereinafter, this will mean that you do not need to touch this column - it is calculated automatically.  And the rest is just necessary.  In particular, for each position, you must specify the salary "for the plan."  This is usually a little more than the average salary for the position.  Due to the "delta" we have the opportunity to take an employee somewhere "more expensive", and to someone to raise salaries a little.  The post code does not need to be in square brackets, but it is a little more convenient, as you will see later. <br><br>  Go to the tab "Staffing".  Here you need to enter data for all existing employees, plus add vacancies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ed9/ebc/744/ed9ebc74475eb9f46ae0f6beea83e146.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/731/86a/1b2/73186a1b280df215e7df994b88f1fc44.png"><br><br>  <i>The wide table here is presented in two "rows".</i>  <i>The entire table can be viewed <a href="">here.</a></i> <br><br>  For each job you need: <br><ul><li>  Choose from the Job Code drop-down list </li><li>  Choose from the drop-down list "Department Code" </li><li>  The sequence number or unique code of the employee within the position; </li><li>  Enter the full name or the word "Vacancy" </li><li>  Indicate the salary and bonus. </li></ul><br><br>  Calculate automatically: <br><ul><li>  The full code of the employee, including the department, position and unique number / code within the position; </li><li>  A position with the text indicating the department (just ‚Äúfor beauty‚Äù, as they say - to check whether the codes are specified correctly); </li><li>  <b>The average salary for his position and the deviation from the average salary is absolute and relative</b> ; </li></ul><br><br>  Now the fun part.  In the tab "Finplan by department" you need to ensure that the codes of departments and positions in all three tables were filled in correctly.  If you have only leading programmers in the department, then these tables will have one row.  If also layout designers, no matter how many they are, then two. <br><br>  In the first table you should indicate the position code, department and number of employees by months. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/85d/ca7/d1e/85dca7d1ed5ea5e35de4b430c56660a2.png"><br><br>  In the second and third tables you only need to specify the exact same set of posts as in the first.  You don‚Äôt need to touch anything else, everything is calculated on its own (remember that italic selected cells where everything is calculated for you) <br><br>  The third table - the planned average salaries by month - auxiliary: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/520/5a2/c0c/5205a2c0c6e8795aa99cb0a5bd69a274.png"><br><br><br>  The second table is the most important.  This is a table of payroll expenditures without taxes by months and positions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1ba/0b9/616/1ba0b961692259aa7aeb1e25da49930e.png"><br><br>  At once I will make a reservation, here everywhere filling of tables is delusional.  Therefore, two testers in the IT department randomly entered here for different positions.  In principle, this would have had no effect on the numbers, but since this is still a template ... In general, this should not happen. <br><br>  That's basically it.  You can download templates <a href="http://rauf.livejournal.com/437506.html">on my blog</a> or on my website, <a href="http://raliev.ru/usefuldocs/">RaufAliev.ru</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/112108/">https://habr.com/ru/post/112108/</a></p>
