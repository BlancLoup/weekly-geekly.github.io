You can, of course, exclude it from your news or even remove such active reposters altogether, but not with all people it is convenient to do. <br><br>  Especially noticeable when users social.  networks slip viral advertising.  And often the reposter himself does not understand that he is sending not just an amusing video, but an advertisement, thereby helping unfortunate hungry marketers to earn on a piece of bread with butter and caviar. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  In fact, viral video is one of the most interesting marketing tools on the Internet.  The strategy is to create and widely disseminate the most interesting for the user of video content.  The main advantage of this type of advertising is that the users themselves are engaged in the transmission of advertising information through word of mouth.  Thus, the company that launches a viral video, makes a profit with a minimum amount of investment in promotion.  Content itself rushes across the expanses of the web, overtaking its target audience.

    <blockquote>  The status of a viral video is received, if it scored more than 100 thousand views within 3-4 weeks after being uploaded to the Network, for RuNet this is a generally accepted standard.  Popular "viruses" are those videos that gain over 200 thousand views at the start.  The clips fall into the category of champions, having surpassed the 300 thousand bar. One can gain 1 million and more views. <br><br>  Most often, this method of advertising is used by food and beverage companies, mobile operators, hardware stores, but over the past few years, software manufacturers around the world have also begun to launch viral commercials. </blockquote><br>  I tried to remember what a viral video from the IT sphere came across to me lately.  Several clips came to mind, I want to share my impressions. <br><br>  Microsoft, as always, tried to take a budget and scale, launching a viral video for Windows 8 advertising at the end of last year. In order to shoot it, a very spectacular advertising campaign was held in the capital of Norway, symbolizing how the new operating system is breaking down barriers.  The company hired the famous Norwegian group Datarock, built a fake house and placed a live icon from the Windows 8 desktop on the asphalt in front of this house.  When the passerby steps on the luminous block, the wall of the house falls and the real performance begins. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/mof-Dq3hvWs&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700258&amp;usg=ALkJrhiYbQ57HBkH6J1ziZOKW30zXn5gJw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Movie scored more than 800 thousand views in a few months.  Of course, this is not the only example of a successful "virus" in the field of IT abroad.  Another example is viral advertising from Google: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D3-WRn9keARE">www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-WRn9keARE</a> <br><br>  And now let's see what is happening with our software manufacturers.  Russian viral advertising in the field of IT is only developing and, naturally, does not reach its foreign counterparts.  However, as they say, attempts were ... Here are a few examples that came across. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/9bqD0JWde10%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700258&amp;usg=ALkJrhjvdoAAs-lCDg-4sjR2b3nP9U8nfg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/YpSgIIlv5PQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700258&amp;usg=ALkJrhg3pqw38JN4IFYVdK-YG5R5mdvPwQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/vzEb83KSAUs%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700258&amp;usg=ALkJrhgIGLlMH9ymQAeEG9l3ORTmWFJAHQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Here is an example from the early one (caution: profanity): <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DyJN6L6D295w">www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJN6L6D295w</a> <br><br>  Are you impressed?  Feel the difference, as they say.  These videos can not be called a full-fledged "virus", but apparently, they thought so. <br><br>  Of course, you should not compare the budgets of domestic IT-companies and foreign giants of the industry, but, in my opinion, these videos are made frankly carelessly.  Our videos are poor in comparison with foreign ones, apparently due to lack of experience and budget.  As a result, promotion with the help of such viral content does not work.  I dare remind advertisers that high-quality, creative videos, as well as the use of humor, reinforce the viral effect. <br><br>  It is clear that advertising cannot get anywhere even among friends, but I want to believe that its level will increase, and our news feeds will become a little less dull than completely. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/177963/">https://habr.com/ru/post/177963/</a></p>
