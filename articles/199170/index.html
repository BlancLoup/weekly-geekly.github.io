In order to maintain the relevance of my knowledge I try to keep abreast of the state of affairs in the field of information technology for which I regularly monitor.  Since I am interested in cloud technologies and services, I am also interested in technologies that provide work with a stationary personal computer remotely via the Internet from various devices, for example, from a tablet.  Freedom - from noise, dust and the need to sit in front of the monitor, in my opinion, sufficient reasons for the use of cloud technology. <br><br>  I managed to master open virtualization using QEMU / KVM, forwarding video cards to virtual machines, but unfortunately I was faced with the fact that remote access using open protocols to forward video cards did not have sufficient performance.  I found a way out of the current situation in the hardware encoding of the video signal from a video card either through the use of cloud video cards or through the use of a video broker. <br><br>  Cloud video cards are video cards that have a built-in video encoder that captures and compresses the video stream and sends it over the network.  Examples of these video cards are video series: AMD Radeon SKY and Nvidia GRID.  Using these video cards, you can create your own cloud service, but unfortunately these video cards differ significantly in price from regular video cards and are not available in the retail market.

      Video obdkaster - a device that, like an IP camera, broadcasts a video stream to a network, but not from a camera, but from a forwarding video card.  Using these devices, you can create your own cloud service, although these devices are also not cheap. <br><br>  However, what was my surprise when on one of the sites of video observatory manufacturers, one of the residents of Skolkovo, I discovered a real cutting-back Skolkovo innovative product. <br><br><h4>  Skolkovsky innovative rolling product </h4><br>  Meet the real rolling-sliding Skolkovo innovative product " <a href="http://labs.epiphan.ru/ru/">Epiphan Distance Doc 2</a> ".  A small <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3F%26v%3DlEsj8DcTu2w">video</a> describing what was happening: <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/lEsj8DcTu2w%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256&amp;usg=ALkJrhj2t0zMJGJFar0eSaV1rI8X5iVYMg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Let's see what this device is. <br><br><h5>  Imaginary specialization </h5><br>  We open the <a href="http://labs.epiphan.ru/ru/distancedoc2/">Russian site Epiphan</a> , we look and see that this is a common video scanner with something similar to the model " <a href="http://www.epiphan.ru/products/broadcasting/vgadvi-broadcaster/">VGADVI Broadcaster</a> ".  Any interfaces for medical devices, other than standard ones, not used in other areas are absent.  From here we make the assumption that the manufacturer of this device deliberately deceives (misleads) potential buyers about the specialization of their device for medicine.  Perhaps this is done to participate in the upcoming public procurement. <br><br>  Once ‚ÄúDistance Doc 2‚Äù is a common video broadcast, it can be used not only in medicine.  Consider a theoretically simple example - remote access to the computer screen of a video surveillance operator (PSE, PSI MIA, security department, etc.) using this device over a network, for example, from another building. <br><br>  Signals from cameras are fed to the video surveillance operator's computer; a special video surveillance program displays video streams from the cameras using a video card on the monitor screen.  To the question ‚ÄúIs it possible to connect this device to a video card?‚Äù, We can safely answer ‚ÄúYes‚Äù, since it is quite possible to connect to a video card using this device via VGA and DVI.  The ability to record in the field of video surveillance can also be used and it will be a pleasant option, but not redundant functionality. <br><br>  In order to put a bullet in the proof of the alleged specialization of ‚ÄúEpiphan Distance Doc 2‚Äù to participate in public procurement, we open the American website and in the <a href="http://www.epiphan.com/products/product.php%3Fcatalog%3D2">videobodsters</a> section <a href="http://www.epiphan.com/products/product.php%3Fcatalog%3D2">we</a> do not find any mention of ‚ÄúDistance Doc 2‚Äù. <br><br>  Thus, we conclude that this innovative product is really prepared for participation in public procurement in Russia. <br><br><h5>  Super profit </h5><br>  While watching the above commercial, I was interested in the words of Victor Dubrovin, director of sales development at Epiphan Systems, told by him at the end of the video that these devices cost 100 to 150 thousand rubles, when analogues are sold for 300 thousand rubles. <br><br>  I knew beforehand that Epiphan is practically a monopolist and is not at all embarrassed to pursue a policy of reverse dumping in Russia, to illustrate this, we compare prices for the company's products in the United States and Russia for the twin model VGADVI Broadcaster. <br><ul><li>  In the USA, this model will cost $ 1,600 ( <a href="https://ssl.epiphan.com/order/order_nv.php%3Fpid%3D226">ssl.epiphan.com/order/order_nv.php?pid=226</a> ) </li><li>  In Russia, this model will already cost $ 2,990 ( <a href="http://www.epiphan.ru/products/broadcasting/vgadvi-broadcaster/">www.epiphan.ru/products/broadcasting/vgadvi-broadcaster</a> ) </li></ul><br><br>  The difference is almost doubled.  If we translate US dollars (the dollar exchange rate is 31.6775, as of October 27, 2013), then we get the value of ‚ÄúVGADVI Broadcaster‚Äù in rubles: <br><ul><li>  The price for the USA is 50684 rubles. </li><li>  the price for Russia is 94715,725 rubles </li></ul><br><br>  Thus, due to reverse dumping, buyers from Russia overpay almost half the price of 44031,725 ‚Äã‚Äãrubles.  Discrimination in all its glory.  It does not climb into any gate. <br><br><h4>  Total </h4><br>  Using the example of Distance Doc 2, we saw the true face of Epiphan, its attitude to Russian buyers, as well as the true face of Skolkovo science city, as well as the face of the political regime that genocide the Russian population, in particular, by plundering the budget using the above science city . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/199170/">https://habr.com/ru/post/199170/</a></p>
