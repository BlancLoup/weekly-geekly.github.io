  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Kingston MobileLite Wireless - Hybrid Hybrid Review</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  What is announced by the main trump card of androids in disputes over world domination when it comes to the memory of devices?  Of course, support for memory cards, and this does not take away.  Well, of course, the apples have become bigger, even 128 gigabytes each, but the price for such devices significantly exceeds the cost of a microSD card of the corresponding size.  And what to do?  To surrender to green men without a fight?  Meekly admit that Apple is cashing in on unhappy brand fans?  Not really, there are a couple of options, like the Camera Connection Kit, but they are specialized, but there is a simpler gadget, non-unique, but worthy of attention.  Under the cut - a brief story about Kingston MobileLite Wireless - a device with which content can be transferred to a smartphone (android or apple) and copied from a smartphone to a memory card or USB flash drive. I‚Äôll note that this miracle can also feed a smartphone from a built-in battery, the truth is not very powerful - only 1800 mAh. <img alt="Kingston Mobile Lite Wireless" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8d1/499/b06/8d1499b06ca1a449d6da7d6c93c9c90b.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Modest dimensions, the Spartan kit, not a hint of luxury and the desire to dissolve the user for a couple of bucks for compatibility with Apple.  A microUSB cable and a microSD-SD adapter are attached as a necessary whale (I honestly don‚Äôt understand it, because usually when buying a card, such an adapter is included). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/563/7d9/519/5637d9519777c4aaedd4b7a806864ca6.jpg"><br>  Due to the strictness of the lines, the thing turned out to be not youthful, but pretty.  Matte (finally no gloss) black case and gray matte lining - strictly, seriously, monolithically. <br><img alt="Kingston Mobile Lite Wireless" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8d1/499/b06/8d1499b06ca1a449d6da7d6c93c9c90b.jpg"><br>  By briefly pressing the power button, one of the three LEDs lights up green and the powerbank function turns on.  Hold for longer and the blue diodes blink cheerfully - Wi-Fi activity and Internet connections. <br><img alt="Kingston Mobile Lite Wireless" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b37/aa2/218/b37aa2218036b19823dc05817fb74bfc.jpg"><br><img alt="Kingston Mobile Lite Wireless" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8eb/193/578/8eb19357884640a43d2cddcc71586967.jpg"><br>  If you look at the inscription Mobile Lite Wireless correctly (that is, so that it can be read without turning your head), then on the right is a slot for memory cards.  Supports reading and writing to SD / SDHC / SDXC and micro-formats of the same cards through the adapter. <br><img alt="Kingston Mobile Lite Wireless" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1fe/021/bfb/1fe021bfb0149a49a02f85c252e137cc.jpg"><br><img alt="Kingston Mobile Lite Wireless" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d23/b70/b63/d23b70b63a71bc0dd6487f8ebe32484a.jpg"><br>  Left - USB port for flash drives (up to 128 GB) and microUSB for connecting to a computer (by the way, my device did not work as a wired card reader, which is a pity) or a powerbank recharger.  The ability to feed a voracious exploiter is important on the road or on a long "trip" to nature.  I don‚Äôt like to drag the powerbank specifically, but you can try such a combine. <br><img alt="Kingston Mobile Lite Wireless" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2ec/495/be8/2ec495be8de70a17904a2494fa00cda9.jpg"><br>  In order for the miracle to happen and the flight of units and zeros through the air between your smartphone and Kingston Mobile Lite Wireless began, you first need to install the software from the App Store or Google Play (who you like) - it is called (you won‚Äôt believe) Mobile Lite. After installing the step-by-step instructions on Connection - I bring screenshots from the Samsung Galaxy S 4 LTE (why I‚Äôll tell you about it in another article). <br><img alt="Kingston Mobile Lite Wireless software" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7c1/e32/ea2/7c1e32ea2db252d22e5b9b2f803dafd8.png"><img alt="Kingston Mobile Lite Wireless software" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/524/06c/889/52406c889abc954383f3b6e7e13f927e.png"><br>  Press the button and the device will turn on!  Hold the button and he will start looking for other devices!  Expected).  The network with the original name Mobile Lite Wireless allows you to connect to yourself without a password. <br><img alt="Kingston Mobile Lite Wireless software" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a5b/984/63b/a5b98463b1360724e55067e98a64dace.png"><img alt="Kingston Mobile Lite Wireless software" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3fd/fc8/916/3fdfc89161442c5ec862a95416b07114.png"><br>  How to insert a memory card and a flash drive, I think it is understandable.  Why the gadget is going to the Internet is not very clear to me, but asks.  Most likely, he will try to perform the function of the router, but I will honestly say that I did not check it. <br><img alt="Kingston Mobile Lite Wireless software" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4c8/ee2/630/4c8ee26308b9312e8ec05d22a8876317.png"><img alt="Kingston Mobile Lite Wireless software" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6d0/fb2/db3/6d0fb2db37100c9a11eba607cf3e5e25.png"><br>  Favorite screen - and now go to our website together!  Yeah, sure.  And the last frame is a conductor, right here at home) A USB flash drive or card is available with all its contents, not only for you, but also for two more colleagues or friends. <br>  What is the need for such a cyberthread?  There are several answers: <br>  1) It would really be convenient for me to share the photos sitting in the press center at an exhibition or conference - people write reports, take it, use it. <br>  2) You can immediately reset any file from the recorder to your smartphone and upload it to Youtube literally in real time. <br>  3) You can watch movies from a flash drive, bypassing iTunes =) <br>  4) You can feed the mobile phone with energy of 30-40 percent if necessary. <br>  Personally, all of the above scenarios were tested, it turned out competently with the disassembly of photos after the press conference - with one foto three packages for ready-made reports.  For fun, they watched videos with GoHero Pro (she works as a video recorder for a colleague) after a trip for lunch - great, fun, and right there they need to copy them to their smartphones.  Watching cartoons is also possible, but at home, with a NAS, it makes no sense.  The feeding was also useful, recently at the Intel conference I forgot to charge the device at night, I had to pull the Mobile Lite out of my backpack and recover up to 50% of the charge) <br>  Surely you can come up with something else and not just one point, but for now I have Kingston MobileLite Wireless settling in a photo backpack.  It will be useful =) </div>
