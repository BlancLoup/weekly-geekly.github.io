  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Some household points of electricity consumption</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, there are articles ( <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/245762/">one</a> , <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/245926/">two</a> ) on the use of alternative energy sources for the supply of apartments / houses, and possible prospects are also mentioned.  In this article I want to provide some data that can be the basis for further comparisons and analyzes regarding the consumption of electrical energy. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Why tariffs and consumption together in one article </h3><br>  Residential consumers - the main source of uneven load.  Therefore, in order to manage the process of consumption, new tariffs are introduced, previously available only to enterprises.  The main reason is the development of devices whose power cannot be unnoticed in the overall balance.  If earlier these were exclusively engines, like a washing machine or an air conditioner, now electric cars and hybrid cars are appearing that require charging from the mains (this is more economical for the latter). <br>  To do this, the article presents the current tariffs and devices that consume energy to create a more or less complete picture. <br><br><h3>  Electricity payment </h3><br>  To date, there are several options for tariffs for electricity.  Some of them are peculiar only to enterprises, others are also available to residential consumers. <br><br><h4>  Single zone tariff </h4><br>  The classic rate at which electricity is paid in most post-Soviet countries.  There is only a fee for kWh.  With simplicity of calculations, it has a major drawback - the cost of servicing and replacing meters and other equipment on the balance sheet is included in the cost of kWh.  For someone who consumes a lot, it means that he pays for one job several times over the same period.

    <h4>  Two-zone fare </h4><br>  The division of the cost of electricity into conventional "day" and "night."  The ‚Äúday‚Äù includes peak and half peak loads.  It is simple to account for, but requires correction depending on the length of the daylight hours (which is not always the case).  In general, it is more profitable than a single-zone tariff for a residential consumer. <br><br><h4>  Three-zone tariff </h4><br>  The cost of electricity is divided into three main groups: peak, half-peak and night.  Allows you to adjust consumption, setting very high prices for peak and low for the night, equalizing this load.  As a rule, it is used for enterprises in connection with the complexity and price of meters, but in the future it is planned to introduce them for residential consumers. <br><br><h4>  Multizone tariff </h4><br>  Further division.  Used for generating plants, as a rule, to determine the cost of energy in half-hour intervals (15 and 5 minute intervals are possible).  Due to the complexity of metering by consumers, it is almost never used at low voltages. <br><br><h4>  Two-part tariff </h4><br>  Tariff division into two components: <br>  - cost per kWh; <br>  - the cost of connection and connection maintenance (usually depends on the connected capacity). <br>  It is applied at the enterprises and, in the EU countries, to household consumers.  Benefits for residential customers - allows you to avoid overpaying for checking meters with high consumption.  The cost of the second component is considered based on the energy consumed, as an indicator of installed capacity. <br><br><h4>  Three-part tariff </h4><br>  Improvement of the previous tariff.  In this case, the charge for the installed power and transmission of this power is divided.  It is used to account for the load lines, also allows you to pre-divide the financial flows of the energy market participants.  Used for businesses that consume large amounts of energy / power.  More open rate for control. <br><br><h4>  Tariff withdrawal </h4><br>  Tariffs are combined, i.e.  it may well be a ‚Äútwo-stage single-zone‚Äù or ‚Äúthree-zone two-part‚Äù.  The presence of such a number of tariffs is due to the fact that the best tariff is <b>‚Äúmulti-zone three-part‚Äù</b> , but its implementation requires large expenditures on accounting infrastructure and expensive meters, so various economically viable options are used. <br><br><h3>  Household electrical equipment </h3><br>  Below is a list of major consumers, namely electrical appliances, which can be found in a modern home.  The list from the most powerful to the least powerful according to the <b>maximum</b> load: <br><br><h5>  1. Electric cooker </h5><br>  Power up to 10500 W with a combined block of the cooking surface (4 burners) and electric ovens. <br>  1 burner has a capacity of 1200 to 1800 W, depending on the size.  The induction cooker has almost the same power, but its efficiency is higher, therefore the use is more economical. <br>  The oven usually has a power of 2000 to 3000 watts.  Even a gas oven can incorporate electric heating (grill function) up to 3000 watts of power. <br><br><h5>  2. Electric kettle </h5><br>  Power up to 2500 W (1.5 liters).  It does not work a lot per day, but because of the power input to the consumption is rather big. <br><br><h5>  3. washing machine </h5><br>  Power up to 2400 W (5 kg).  It strongly depends on the mode, the temperature of heating water. <br><br><h5>  4. Iron </h5><br>  Power up to 2000 watts. <br><br><h5>  5. Microwave </h5><br>  Power up to 2500 W (grill mode).  Put on the 5th place, as when working without a "grill" consumes up to 700 watts. <br><br><h5>  6. Air conditioning </h5><br>  Power up to 700 W (split system per room up to 40 m¬≥). <br><br><h5>  7-8.  Fridge </h5><br>  Power from 50 to 200 watts (depending on size). <br><br><h5>  7-8.  Television </h5><br>  Power from 50 to 200 watts (depending on size). <br><br><h4>  Consumers outside categories </h4><br>  The equipment representatives shown below have very wide power limits. <br><br><h5>  Electric floor heating </h5><br>  Power from 200 W to ... (standard unit up to 3000 W, there is more).  Depends on the area of ‚Äã‚Äãuse, anywhere from 150 W / m¬≤. <br><br><h5>  System unit / laptop </h5><br>  Actually "computational part".  Power is very different. <br><br><h5>  Printer / MFP </h5><br>  Depending on the technology and print size. <br><br><h5>  Lighting </h5><br>  Depending on the size, technology, brightness. <br><br><h5>  Water boiler </h5><br>  Room storage boiler, up to 100 liters - 2000 watts. <br>  Flow boiler - from 3000 W, the most common (for 1/2 "pipe) - 5-8 kW. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion on electrical appliances </h4><br>  Predict the load with high probability possible for the air conditioner, appliances for cooking.  Everything else is unpredictable and the probability of simultaneous use of a group of equipment based on practice is used.  The problem is that the emergence of large batteries is an unknown factor that can both positively and negatively affect the reliability of electricity supply at first.  Naturally, there are more advantages in the future, but this is a prospect of 10-15 years, as there will be many questions about the operation of power systems when connecting both individual accumulating devices and cars. <br><br><h3>  Sources </h3><br>  The sources used data from the Internet and personal experience, because, for example, not all electrical appliances that may be found in homes are included, but the most common ones are mentioned. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/376591/">https://habr.com/ru/post/376591/</a></p>
