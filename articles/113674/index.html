Diversity is important. <br><br>  If we talk about Ruby, then to this day there are many different implementations. <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://ruby-lang.org/">CRuby</a> (1.9, 1.8) </li><li>  <a href="http://jruby.org/">Juby</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://rubini.us/">Rubinius</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://ironruby.codeplex.com/">IronRuby</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://macruby.org/">Macruby</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://ruby.gemstone.com/">MagLev</a> </li></ul><br>  In addition to the listed complete implementations of the language, there are also partial implementations, ‚ÄúRuby-like‚Äù languages, and it is difficult for me to even guess how many of them there really can be.

    <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/5d62328d/2f6b62c0/7d97a738/a5a718e7.png"></div><br>  Programmers who prefer Python used to say: ‚ÄúLook at CPython, and Jython, and IronPython.  Is there something similar for Ruby (and Perl)?  These languages ‚Äã‚Äãare too complex for the emergence of alternative implementations. "  Now there are even more implementations of Ruby.  (However, it‚Äôs good that new Python interpreters are developing, like PyPy.) <br><br>  On the other hand, diversity requires sacrifice.  Support for many different platforms requires the investment of a large number of forces, especially if these are new implementations that have not yet reached such a level of compatibility as JRuby, CRuby, MacRuby and Rubinius. <br><br>  I know the price to pay for diversity, and it's worth it. <br><br>  In fact, I praise diversity so much because I want to increase it further by writing a new interpreter. <br><br>  It is called RiteVM, and is intended for embedded devices. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/a4a95f82/71a3c44d/4fa6d612/2548359c.jpg"></div><br>  Ruby was originally developed for Unix, but in embedded systems, Unix and POSIX interfaces are often absent as unnecessary. <br><br>  Since the performance of embedded systems has recently increased significantly, it is often the case that real-time execution can be neglected in favor of using a higher level language. <br><br>  So, we are developing a new interpreter. <br><ul><li>  The interpreter will support a minimal subset of the Ruby language.  Most of the I / O and file functions will be removed (but may be added later). </li><li>  The implementation will be similar to Lua (but with a better language). </li><li>  The interpreter will be modular.  For example, you can implement a translator without eval.  Many parameters can be set at compilation: Float can be implemented as a float or double, Fixnum - as an int, long, long long or something else.  String functions will work with ASCII or UTF-8.  The interpreter will be much less abstracted from the platform, for example, in the implementation for simple devices there may be no file I / O. </li><li>  Floating-point numbers will be implemented as immediate values, which will significantly speed up calculations.  (Note: in Ruby MRI, integers are implemented in such a way that they occupy one platform pointer in memory; Float is an object and takes up substantially more memory.) </li><li>  Minimum requirements include the C99 compiler.  Rite will run on a PC, within <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259E%25D0%25A1%25D0%25A0%25D0%2592">RTOS</a> or by itself, and use less memory and processor resources. </li><li>  A registered virtual machine with a 32-bit word and a set of instructions similar to Lua will be used. </li><li>  To reduce mark &amp; ‚Äã‚Äãsweep delays, the garbage collector will be smooth [incremental - hereinafter approx.  perev.], and, probably, in view of generations [generational]. </li></ul><br>  In addition, Professor Tanaka from Kyushi Institute of Technology is developing a ‚ÄúRuby-chip‚Äù: an <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%259B%25D0%2598%25D0%25A1">FPGA-</a> based MIPS-like processor, to which several instructions have been added that make it easier to find the method and garbage collection. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/63e034f5/aab7cb89/0d54bc5d/3df7ea02.jpg"></div><br>  Rite is the code name of the project at the time of its development, which is carried out as part of the 2010 Regional Project for Research and Development [Regional Innovation Research and Development Project], conducted by the Ministry of Economics [of Japan]. <br><br>  The result will be a Ruby subset implementation that can be applied as: <br><ul><li>  Script engine for games </li><li>  Software for the system "Smart Home", </li><li>  Interpreter in the digital TV firmware, </li><li>  To control robots in other embedded systems where real-time response is not required. </li></ul><br>  Of course, I do not think that all this will appear right now, but in a few years if our business succeeds, this is quite possible. <br><br>  Yes, I almost forgot. <br><br><h4>  Frequently asked Questions </h4><br>  <b>When will Rite be ready?</b> <br>  I dont know.  As I mentioned, this is a two-year (2010-2011) project funded by the Japanese government. <br><br>  <b>Will the RiteVM source codes be open?</b> <br>  Yes.  Most likely, under the MIT license.  However, under a contract with the government, we need a business model.  We will probably choose GPL plus a subscription (as MySQL is distributed). <br><br>  <b>Will RiteVM replace CRuby?</b> <br>  Not at all.  Rite has only a small part of the capabilities of a full implementation, such as CRuby. <br><br>  <b>What will the C API look like?</b> <br>  API RiteVM will be significantly different from CRuby.  The CRuby interface is very easy to use, but it is more difficult to implement [in embedded environments].  Theoretically, compatibility layer development is possible, but we do not plan to do this. <br><br>  <b>Will RiteVM support multiple languages ‚Äã‚Äã[Multilingualization]?</b> <br>  No, you can only choose ACSII or UTF-8 when compiling.  There will not be standard libraries for converting encodings either. <br><br>  <b>Will native threads be supported?</b> <br>  No, RiteVM itself will not support streams.  If you want to use OS threads, you can run each on an interpreter.  [Fibers] can be implemented in the virtual machine, but so far we have not planned this. <br><br>  <b>Will RiteVM be faster than YARV / JRuby / Rubinius?</b> <br>  Hardly.  Improvements will mainly affect floating point operations, like how they will be implemented through immediate values ‚Äã‚Äã[immediates]. <br><br>  <b>How can I contribute to the development of RiteVM?</b> <br>  Please wait until the source code is open.  We will post it on github. <br><br>  <b>Rite?</b>  <b>Sounds familiar.</b> <br>  In 2003, Rite was proposed as a codename for the implementation of Ruby 2.0 in my RubyConf report.  In the end, the YARV virtual machine was used, and I just use the old name.  It is derived from ‚ÄúRuby‚Äù and ‚Äúlite‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>CRuby is Matz.</b>  <b>Are you going to stop working on CRuby?</b> <br>  On the one hand, I no longer make a significant contribution to the development of CRuby, but I am not going to stop it.  CRuby will remain the main Ruby implementation, and I will continue to work as a language architect and community leader. <br><br>  <i>Translation of the second part of the report is also <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/ruby/113635/">published</a> in Habr√©.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/113674/">https://habr.com/ru/post/113674/</a></p>
