Intranet for the automation of organizations in order to improve profitability; <br>  3. noosphere automation system (SANS) for the successful evolution of the whole society. <br>  For 20 years, my first two dreams came true, and I myself began to promote various Intranet projects, but with my third dream, something went wrong.  And what is the most offensive, for the last 20 years, humanity has not come a step closer to my third dream.  And I decided that apparently I would have to work myself to make the fairy tale come true. <br><br><h4>  Noosphere automation system </h4><br>  So what is the third dream?  Everything is very simple - I assumed that soon there will be a system somewhere on the Internet, in which you can: <br><ul><li>  to lay down new knowledge (or make sure that they are already laid out by someone else); </li><li>  to gain knowledge on the problem of interest (or to ascertain their absence in principle); </li><li>  ask for clarification from the experts on the problem of interest (knowledge segment); </li><li>  gather (both virtually and realistically) a group of like-minded people in order to obtain / clarify the knowledge of interest or other goals; </li><li>  receive a notification when a new knowledge about the problem of interest appears in the system. </li></ul><br>  Knowledge here means information that allows a person to solve his problem, or, in terms of synergetics, to change his phase state. <br>  And most importantly - on any of the above items should not be spent more than 5 minutes.  That is, a maximum of 5 minutes - and any of the above actions are fully and fully implemented. <br>  And what is also important, the system should be multilingual.  That is, if someone has put in the knowledge system, for example, in Hindi, then in a maximum of a day this knowledge should become available in all the common languages ‚Äã‚Äãof our planet (it seems there are 40 of them?). <br><br><h4>  Social detonator </h4><br>  It seems that I listed above the information system with simple principles, but its implementation in reality will speed up the social evolution of the whole society many times, perhaps several times, or even an order of magnitude. <a name="habracut"></a>  In order not to go into a boring sociological explanation of the synergistic diversity of social relations and the strength of weak social ties, I will explain with an example.  All my projects were obtained with random (?) Coincidence of people and interests.  Surely others have the same thing.  For example, if I didn‚Äôt go to that interview, and if I didn‚Äôt meet at the interview with my old friend, everything could have been completely different.  And now let's imagine a society in which not a person waits (maybe even his whole life) for coincidences and meetings, but on the contrary, the connections already established are waiting for a person to choose them.  Who knows how many interesting people passed by me, and I was late for just a minute, in how many ambitious projects I did not take part, for example, just because I just got sick with a cold that day and missed luck.  If you recall the books of the popular science fiction writer Max Fry, then he has the term ‚ÄúThe Power of the Unfulfilled‚Äù there.  So, such a system will reveal all potentially possible, but for some reason unfulfilled social ties.  That is, the "unfulfilled" will come to our world.  Or as in one popular song ‚Äúwe could serve in intelligence or play in movies‚Äù - the system will make it so that they serve in intelligence or play in movies, if of course they themselves want (choose) this social connection. <br>  Or even simpler - if a problem is significant to the population, then the system will attract the intellectual potential of millions of people, different cultures speaking different languages ‚Äã‚Äãto solve it, and, if necessary, attracting investments and, most importantly, completely bypassing all this bureaucratic sluggish state. the car.  And since today there are a lot of problems to which the states (neither ours nor others) absolutely do not pay attention, the system mobilizes the potential of humanity to solve these problems.  Problems will be solved, and the effect of the introduction of such a system will be comparable to a social detonator, bringing society to a new evolutionary level.

    <h4>  Based on Boolean algebra </h4><br>  There are two questions - how to make such a system, and why is it still not implemented by anyone? <br>  And here, to my surprise, there is no limit, because despite the fact that <a href="http://n-t.ru/tp/in/boole.htm">George Boole</a> created his <a href="http://www.electrik.info/main/fakty/229-buleva-algebra-chast-1-nemnogo-istorii.html">Boolean algebra</a> specifically for ‚Äúcombining philosophy and mathematics,‚Äù over the past 50 years, no programmer / mathematician has tried to realize his idea using the capabilities of modern computers (let alone so about the capabilities of modern global networks).  Although each programmer took a course in Boolean algebra at the institute.  And the course of modern sociology, too, sort of passed.  However, the emphasis in the teaching of Boolean algebra is on using it for internal purposes of computer science and electronics, and to the humanitarian subjects most technicians develop a persistent aversion as to ‚Äúpseudoscience‚Äù.  Only with these facts can I explain why the ideas lying on the surface (George Boole's essays are written, probably, in almost every 10th university group), so far no one has tried to bring it to life.  Although, what could be simpler - we read Buhl, we keep the modern capabilities of computers and global networks in mind, and design-create a system.  Initially, an experienced single-user sample.  Then the network - for a couple of dozen users.  Well, then for the entire network.  The work is serious, I do not argue, but it is not much more difficult than, say, developing a new computer network game, which have recently been climbing like mushrooms after rain. <br>  To understand this strange phenomenon, one can still give an example of the so-called ‚Äúinterdepartmental hostility‚Äù.  When, for example, professional physicists cannot tolerate professional electronics engineers, considering them arrogant young upstarts (especially as the average salary of electronics engineers is higher).  In turn, electronics engineers silently dislike physicists, considering them to be old boring bore.  Therefore, for example, professional Japanese equipment simply amazes with an abundance of antique technical solutions.  And so my friend (the owner of a small service company) likes to make a toast: ‚Äúso let's drink to the fierce enmity of Japanese physicists and Japanese electronics engineers, which allows us to earn so well‚Äù. <br>  Interdepartmental hostility between representatives of the humanities and technical sciences in general is grandiose, because techies consider humanities to be demagogues (and not unreasonably), and humanities consider techies to be complex, infantile and incapable in a two-word conversation to link (and also, I note, not reasonably). <br><br><h4>  Conclusion (or appeal to the community) </h4><br>  So why am I writing all this?  Time goes on, 20 years have passed since the moment when I had this idea, but in reality it is not embodied.  And I began to think that it might not be implemented at all.  And I decided to direct my forces to the creation of the system described in the article.  I would like to consult with the habrasoobschestvomu, where to start?  Or arrange a similar system as a startup (then what, where)?  Or look for a grant, or something else? <br>  At once I will make a reservation that my main interest in this matter is not so much financial as the desire to make our social reality a little smarter, perhaps.  As Oleg Divov notes in his novel, ‚Äúmodern humanity is not very angry or aggressive, it‚Äôs just very stupid‚Äù. <br>  Join the discussion!  Let's make humanity a little smarter together!  If not us, then who?  Well, not the officials. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/154341/">https://habr.com/ru/post/154341/</a></p>
