  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Project Management: PRINCE2 - PRojects In Controlled Environments</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Greetings, colleagues.  In my article I want to talk about the most popular project management methodology in the UK and Eastern and Northern Europe - <b>PRINCE2</b> .  This methodology was developed by the UK Government and is the only universally used framework for project management in large organizations.  As the name implies, PRINCE2 is designed to structure the project into a controlled environment, which it undoubtedly does an excellent job with. <br><img src="http://img136.imageshack.us/img136/5366/prince2logo.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>PRINCE2</b> is a very clearly structured methodology that allows you to <u>systematically</u> (and not intuitively at random) to carry out projects, while easily scaling the structure and integrating with various techniques, such as Agile or CMMI.  The key difference of PRINCE2 from the same PMBoK is the following - PRINCE2 is a product-oriented method, and PMBoK is an activity-oriented method.  Scalability at the level of programs (project portfolio) is provided by the derivative methodology of MSP (Managing Successful Programs). <br><br>  The fundamental elements of PRINCE2 are <b>a) processes, b) components, c) technology</b> .  In the context of rigidly defined processes, there are clearly defined components that are connected by certain technicians, which each project manager is free to adapt at his discretion.  This is very convenient, because  the whole system is clearly structured, which allows you to connect specific for each phase of the project technology, while not breaking the overall structure.  Also, the most important control tool in PRINCE2 is the division of the project into phases with a clearly defined temporary start and end. <br><br><img src="http://img215.imageshack.us/img215/4945/60445193.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Processes and components in PRINCE2</i>

      The main principle in PRINCE2 is product-based planning.  This means that work on a project begins with an understanding of the final product (final product) and the subsequent splitting of it into smaller by-products.  The next step is to build a product flowchart, which describes all the interdependencies of by-products and the sequence of their implementation.  In fact, the project plan does not look like a task tree, but a product tree. <br><br><img src="http://img228.imageshack.us/img228/7306/p2plan.jpg" alt="image">  vs. <img src="http://img134.imageshack.us/img134/1493/pplan.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>From left product-based planning, right activity-based planning</i> <br><br>  All results of the work are divided into 2 categories - management products (management products) and <b>specialized products</b> (specialist products).  Management products are all documents, mandatory of which are the PID (Project Initiation Document).  In essence, a PID is quite a lengthy document, including a Project Brief with a business case (what we used to call Project Vision) and a product description (Product Description, something like User Stories from Scrum), and Product Flowchart, and accordingly a detailed project plan.  Specialized products are nothing else but sub-products (functional elements). <br><br>  Consider an example of the convenient integration of PRINCE2 and Agile Scrum.  In fact, Scrum is also fully product-oriented, because  It relies on the Product Backlog, in which the required functionality is described in the form of User Stories (of the same descriptions (sub) products).  Those.  it turns out that PRINCE2 is a high-level framework into which the low-level Scrum method fits based on the commonality of products.  And even in the most insidious aspect - Change Management - both approaches adhere to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äúfreezing‚Äù the functional within the sprint / phase, and also share the general principles of the trade-off matrix: resources, time, functionality. <br><br>  If the respected habocompany is interested in PRINCE2, I could highlight this wonderful methodology in detail (since I am a certified professional who has worked on it for many years), and also share templates in .doc / .xls and other useful material. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/70051/">https://habr.com/ru/post/70051/</a></p>
