There is a processor - there is a video</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Copyright issues are often raised on Habr√©.  Now and there, there are cases when right-possessing companies win the courts against social networks.  But what should we, ordinary users and consumers of content do?  Going to the store for the disc - too lazy, and not particularly cheap.  Downloading from torrents is illegal.  Sites where you can watch licensed movies for free is a good option.  But not everything is there for free, and the quality suffers when viewed over the Internet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bc5/24d/6e6/bc524d6e672923337dfbb64552b8962d.png"><br><br>  It seems that the only company that can solve this problem is Intel.  And she decided it.  Intel has launched a new, even revolutionary Intel Insider technology.  What can bind the largest manufacturer of processors and video products?  All the details inside. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  What it is? </h4><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZhN_cKVBx1k&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjjAv5CkLdbeejcOu1kglr6tPcn2w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  As you know, Sandy Bridge processors of the second generation already support Intel Insider technology.  It allows you to create a secure channel between a server with high-quality licensed videos and a user's computer. <br><br>  It is assumed that through such a protected channel, film studios and other copyright holders will be able to broadcast video in high definition to law-abiding users who have paid for viewing.  The risk of interception of this broadcast by lovers of ‚Äúfree cheese‚Äù is minimized.  It is noteworthy that Intel diligently avoids the application of the DRM label to this technology - a rights management system, which in the early version of the implementation itself to some extent compromised. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/pirWcxe774s%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjD-jyN9RGNisQL1UmbY5ihMDl-yQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  Where will it be applied? </h4><br>  US studios are already interested in Intel Insider technology, they plan to launch high-definition video broadcast services, including stereoscopic versions of films. <br><br>  Notice, almost every film studio has its own similar projects.  Why did they decide to support third-party?  Everything is quite easily explained: Intel Insider is tied to the second generation of Core i3 / i5 / i7 processors, which provide hardware, rather than software content protection.  That is, it will be possible to access the film if you just steal your processor.  According to Erik Reid of Intel, the company has already entered into contracts with CinemaNow, Dixons Retail, Hungama Digital Media Entertainment, Image Entertainment, Sonic Solutions and Warner Bros.  Digital distribution, and the appearance of films in the service will occur simultaneously with the release on DVD or Blu-ray.  However, it is not very clear how the service will be implemented and how seriously it is connected in hardware with the Intel platform. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/YtX3BISSlgQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiFay3E3h8Bk6tgUlp6jNwDv9Z4_g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Another idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãIntel Insider is that the user could not go to the cinema at the time of the premiere, but pay and watch a movie at home.  It is clear that now it is impossible to realize this, the craftsmen will still find how to pull out the film and spread it around the world.  But if the binding to the gland is made, and also, the transmission will go through a secure channel, then this possibility will be.  This will significantly increase the profits of companies, because it is difficult to even imagine how much money the film companies lose just because a person is too lazy to go to the cinema.  And here everything is near, on your computer, and even in high resolution. <br><br>  The service also supports wireless movie playback technology up to 1080p via the WiDi 2.0 interface.  The second version of the standard will work in the same way as the first, allowing the desktop to be displayed on an HD screen.  Unfortunately, to support Full HD, you need a new hardware receiver;  also there is still a 2 second delay.  About the cost of films and in general about the commercial component of Intel Insider is not yet known. <br><br><h4>  How will it look like? </h4><br>  Intel Inside already has a page - <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/intel-insider-for-premium-hd-home-entertainment.html">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/intel-insider-for-premium-hd-home-entertainment.html</a> <br>  It describes what 3 steps need to be done to start watching movies in HD quality. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/236/bdf/902/236bdf902d7049fcf3f180338b034056.png"><br><br>  Actually, these actions are elementary.  The first is to buy a computer based on the second generation Intel Core processor.  Second - go to the site where you can buy a movie.  The third is to find a movie and start watching (perhaps by paying in advance). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b75/b46/c9f/b75b46c9fa1c6534f4f756eb72f4df39.png"><br><br>  As you can see, buying a movie if you have an Intel Core processor is very simple.  Soon this technology will be in Russia. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/138507/">https://habr.com/ru/post/138507/</a></p>
