I have long been going to talk about my experience of moving from Ukraine to Latvia.  I am a web programmer, originally from the glorious city of Zaporozhye, in Ukraine.  I decided to see the world and gain experience in other countries of the world. <br><br>  I did not search for difficult ways, I created a resume in English and submitted it to the HR company, having previously indicated my wishes.  One of which is the lack of a language barrier, since I don‚Äôt have everything as rosy as I would like to ... The offers fell one after the other, just a week later I received an offer from a large international company <i><a href="http://www.accenture.com/lv-en/Pages/index.aspx">Accenture</a></i> .  They offered a job in the Latvian branch. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Job interviews </h4><br>  To get into the company, I passed a series of interviews.  The first was with a representative of the Kiev-based HR-company, after which recommendations were received from my manager (in the company I worked at that time), which were handed over to Accenture representatives.  A few days later, the first interview with the Latvian side was scheduled.

      <br>
      The first interview was introductory, also with HR, but from Accenture.  Simple, pleasant communication, talked about the company, opportunities, asked questions about work experience.  A few days later another interview was scheduled - with a technical specialist.  He asked a number of standard questions to determine the level of knowledge of core technologies, after which there was easy, easy communication, asked to talk about the projects in which he participated, the technologies he used, the problems that he encountered during work and how to solve them.  The interview lasted about an hour and a half.  Then we said goodbye, but I was not informed of any results ... A few days later HR contacted me again and appointed another interview with the company's manager.  When the manager called, it immediately became clear that I approached them.  They told me again about the company, discussed the salary, and the date when I am ready to move.  Since by this time, I had finally decided everything for myself, my answer was: ‚ÄúI am ready now!‚Äù. <br><br><h4>  Preparing for the move </h4><br>  Looking ahead to say that the preparation took me two months, the company took over all the costs of relocation. <br><br>  First of all, they sent me an e-mail employment contract.  I printed out two copies, put my signatures and sent them to Latvia via DHL.  Also, together with the contract, I sent a notarized copy of the passport, certificate, and diploma (diploma from the ‚ÄúStep‚Äù satellite, which is not quoted).  Three days later, the documents were in the company's office in Latvia.  During the next week, the company made a call to work for me, paid for insurance and sent these documents, together with a labor contract (with signatures from their side) to Ukraine.  Three days later I received all these documents in my hands in Zaporozhye. <br><br>  <i>UPD</i> : I don‚Äôt have a higher education, a diploma that was attached about courses from the Shag spacecraft (in fact, it was unnecessary, just attached, just in case).  A diploma of higher education can replace a document confirming that you have worked in this field (in this case, IT) for more than three years ... but in this case you cannot qualify for a Blue Card, only at Residence Permit. <br><br>  My next step was to get a work visa to Latvia.  The process was quite simple.  The Latvian Embassy, ‚Äã‚Äãat that time, was only in Kiev (as far as I know, now it should already be in Odessa).  But documents for a visa can be submitted through the courier service PonnyExpress.  The nearest office from Zaporizhia is in Dnepropetrovsk.  I filed documents in one day.  The main thing is that, at the time of filing, all the necessary documents were collected, namely: passport, certificate of good conduct, employment contract, identification code, photographs (for a visa), plane tickets (or ticket reservations) and a completed visa application form take on the website of the Latvian Embassy.  All this was packed in a package and sent by courier on the same day.  After 10 days, the visa was in my hands.  True, at that moment there was one nuance, from the embassy I was returned only a passport with a visa for 60 days, with the right to work, but the employment contract and identification code disappeared somewhere.  But it does not matter how important, because the cherished visa was in my hands. <br><br><h4>  Flight and Arrival </h4><br>  I flew on February 10 of this year.  I bought the tickets myself (on arrival the company compensated the cost of the tickets).  Flying from Dnepropetrovsk.  Unfortunately there was no direct flight, flew with a transfer in Kiev.  From Dnepropetrovsk I flew out at 7 am, at 8:00 am I was already in Kiev.  Departure from Kiev at 11:45 and at 12:30 arrival in Riga.  Passport control passed without problems, asked about the purpose of the visit, asked to show the employment contract.  Communicated in Russian without problems, in Latvia everyone understands Russian.  At the exit from the airport, a man was waiting for me with a sign on which my first and last name was written - it was the taxi driver that the company ordered. <br><br><h4>  Housing </h4><br>  Even before I flew out, I found a suitable apartment.  I was looking for a two-room, spacious apartment, not far from the office and that it was convenient for the child, since I am moving with my family.  In search of an apartment, the company also helped me, they hired a broker at their own expense, who helped me find suitable housing.  Prices for apartments are not small, but there is a range to choose from.  The spread is from 250 and higher, depending on the area, repair and so on.  I have an apartment not far from the office, as I wanted, 2.5km, in a new building, with a beautiful terrace and a playground, near a school, a supermarket 100m, excellent transport interchange (stop 100m from the house, you can go to any part of Riga).  The apartment is fully furnished: folding sofa-corner, kitchen, dishwasher, stove, oven, refrigerator, table, chairs, separate double bed, several closets, washing machine.  I am the first tenant in this apartment. <br><br>  The owner of the apartment must give permission for the fact that you and your family will be registered in this apartment. <br><br>  The house I live in: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/30e/f64/d46/30ef64d4676d544f3e9f7a605d79f9ad.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Bank account </h4><br>  The salary is paid completely white, and paid on a bank card.  Foreigners open the map, in principle, no problem.  You need to come to the bank, fill out a questionnaire, pay the cost of the card and consider the questionnaire (28-50 euros).  Two weeks later, they call by phone and report the results, then you can pick up the card.  I made a card in SwedBank, this is the most popular and reliable bank in Latvia (based on local statistics). <br><br><h4>  Local communication </h4><br>  Also on arrival there was a need for communication (mobile and internet).  This question is quite simply resolved.  I went to the office of the local telephone company LMT and connected.  Foreigners can only connect a prepaid number, unfortunately, do not connect the contract.  The connection is pretty good, the internet is excellent (4G). <br><br><h4>  Residence </h4><br>  Having worked for a month in the company, having become acquainted with all the processes, workplace and team, there was a question about obtaining a residence permit.  Here, too, everything turned out to be quite simple.  The company submitted an application that they want me to work with them for a residence permit, and not on a visa, so that they do not have to periodically leave the country and reissue a visa.  Five days after submitting the application, I went to apply: a passport with a visa, a certificate of good conduct (must be translated into English and notarized), identification code, employment contract, rental agreement, permission from the owner for registration, photo, completed application form, which can be taken on the website of the embassy, ‚Äã‚ÄãX-Ray (fluorography).  The commissioner checked all the documents and sent me to take pictures and fingerprints.  Then they gave me a certificate stating that I submitted the documents and set a date and time when I would be able to pick up my residence permit.  By the way, the company paid an urgent residence permit - 240 euros.  After 10 days I went to the migration service again and in 20 minutes I received my documents. <br><br><h4>  Family Reunion Program </h4><br>  There is a family reunification program in Latvia, according to which your family can obtain a residence permit, but without the right to work.  Under this program, I am now translating my family.  The process is quite simple and in some cases relatives can receive a residence permit in Riga.  That's exactly what I did.  First of all, I went to the migration service and made a call to my wife and daughter, for this call they received a visa for three months.  Upon arrival we will begin to issue a residence permit. <br><br>  The company makes a request to the migration department for family reunification and acts as your guarantor.  Then the contribution is made (it is also made by the company) and in a month the relatives receive a residence permit. <br><br><h4>  A little about Riga </h4><br>  As one of my friends put it: ‚Äú <a href="http://dou.ua/lenta/articles/latvija-calling/">Latvia is the‚Äú our ‚Äùcountry</a> ‚Äù.  During my stay in Riga, I found many friends, people here are open and very sociable.  Also here are constantly held various events: concerts, flash mobs, many holidays and various parties.  Often there are events for programmers, which also can not but rejoice. <br><br>  There are so many places where you can spend time with your family.  A lot of parks, in almost every quarter.  Fresh air everywhere, despite the large number of cars in the city. <br><br>  Jurmala is very close, I get from Riga by car in half an hour.  I don‚Äôt see much sense in Jurmala, as everyone knows what Jurmala is (a small resort town in Latvia). <br><br>  There are some moments that sometimes enrage, and sometimes joy, for me these are seagulls that scream in the morning and shit on the balcony, and a very long day (in the summer it gets dark by 12 at night, how dark it is ...).  But on the other hand, waking up on Saturday morning under the cry of seagulls, you realize that you are at sea, and walking around old Riga on bright nights is very cool! <br><br>  In general, what can I say, gentlemen, I like it here! <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">A few pictures</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/530/24e/3da/53024e3da6da2d91032df6197bb51d71.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/72b/c54/dc8/72bc54dc8364fbea7071d12dd1b38e9a.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/c03/83e/f01/c0383ef01cfa4a0d380e9714e9eefd27.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/87a/41d/d44/87a41dd4455a44214b70f3815facb42c.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/4c0/046/a09/4c0046a09ac2934bb255c0980cb1af50.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  One of Accenture office buildings on the main street of Riga: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/6ab/a4b/2a6/6aba4b2a6a04e60be5f981812918cbee.jpg" alt="image"><br></div></div><br>  Jobs in Latvia can be found <a href="http://cv.lv/">here</a> . <br><br>  Any questions please write in the comments and in lichku, I will be glad to answer and possibly help. <br><br><h4>  UPD: Price Guide </h4><br>  Average bill in a cafe: 10-15 euros <br>  Average price for cappuccino: 1.5 Euro <br>  A pack of cigarettes: 3 euros <br>  Big Mac menu: 5 euros <br><br>  Rent 1-room apartment in the city center: ~ 320 euro / month <br>  Rent 1-room apartment in a residential area: ~ 180 euro / month <br>  Rent 3-room apartment in the city center: ~ 700 euro / month <br>  Rent 3-room apartment in a residential area: ~ 300 euro / month <br><br>  Price per square.  meter in the center: ~ 2000 euro <br>  Price per square.  meter in the bedroom: ~ 1000 euros <br><br>  Average salary after taxes (total): 540 euro / month <br>  One-time fare: 1,035 euros <br>  Monthly Pass: 50 Euro <br>  Liter of gas: 1.12 euros <br>  The fee for 1 km in a taxi: 0.7 euros <br>  A communal apartment in a 3-room apartment in winter: ~ 160 euros <br>  A summer apartment in a 3-room apartment: ~ 80 Euro <br>  Mobile connection: 8 euro / month <br>  Internet (4G): 10 Euro / month <br>  Fitness club: 29 euros per month (28 of them cover insurance from the company) <br>  Cinema ticket price: EUR 5.5 <br>  Shop hours: 8-23 <br><br>  <i>UPD: A little salary in Riga</i> <br><br>  Official statistics, on paper, draws an average salary of 700. A more average and real option is 540 euros per month. <br><br>  I talked once with a taxi driver, he said that he earns 600-900 euros and the employer pays taxes for him.  The girl, a friend, works as a translator in a notarial company and receives a salary of 1,000 euros per month.  Another friend works in a financial company and receives 900 euros per month, but most of it is in the ‚Äúenvelope‚Äù. <br><br>  Many IT companies pay a "gray" salary, that is, through private enterprises. <br><br>  As for developers, Senior PHP will receive an average salary of about 2,000 euros after taxes.  Again, it all depends on the company, some pay more, others pay less. <br><br>  Symfony developers can get from 2.5k. <br><br>  Usually the company calls after-tax wages, that is, what you get on your hands.  In fact, your salary is higher (on paper). <br><br>  There are several lifehacks here, every year you can return some of the taxes paid over the past year.  Here everything is already considered individually on the tax site and for each the amount is different (depending on how much you use free social services), for someone it is 700 euros, and for someone it is 8 euros. <br><br>  UPD: <br>  If anyone is interested in jobs in Latvia with relocation, you are welcome to lichku on Habr√© or Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/dmitriy.medved). <br><br>  JavaScript developers are always needed (for JS devs there are generally excellent places with an excellent salary) and a very large demand for Scala developers (to one of the top employers).  Also Java, iOS, DevOps, SAP ... <br><br>  I will give a recommendation to large and proven local companies. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/291586/">https://habr.com/ru/post/291586/</a></p>
