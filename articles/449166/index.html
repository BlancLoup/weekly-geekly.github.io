Working with the Project Manager </h3><br>  In this topic we will discuss the work with a special tool <a href="https://spds.club/funkcional-nanocad-spds-stroyploshchadka">nanoCAD SPDS Construction Site</a> - Project Manager and consider its main functions.  The manager is designed to create a hierarchy of work, assignment of volumes and dates, as well as rates and resources for them.  According to the compiled work, you can get a number of output documents. <br><br>  To work, you will need the files "\ Topic 1_ Project Manager \ Task \ Project Manager.dwg" and "Project Manager.xml" located in the same directory.  When you open a drawing file, the project file is loaded automatically.  To start the exercise, open the ‚ÄúProject manager.dwg‚Äù file in nanoCAD Construction Site. <br><br><h4>  1.1.  Adding a new job </h4><br>  Call the Project Manager through the menu ‚ÄúConstruction Site - Project Manager‚Äù.  The project associated with this drawing file is automatically loaded and will be displayed in the Manager.  On the "Works" tab, click the "Add Job" button. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qp/nf/6d/qpnf6dbtcdxkvlxpqhuzywfuf-g.jpeg"><br><br>  For new work in the right part of the dialog, enter the values ‚Äã‚Äãshown in the figure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ci/df/k-/cidfk-fljmznivvrmg-vytwnlts.jpeg"><br><br>  New job takes its position in the structure of work according to the position of the cursor at the time of its creation.  To move work to the desired location, use the buttons to move work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/m1/zn/yr/m1znyrrpewqhp59hw_bntzw9g84.jpeg"><br><br>  Move the job to section 3 ‚ÄúSpan structures‚Äù to position 3.6. <br><br><h4>  1.2.  Adding new work from the classifier HESN </h4><br>  Now we add the work is not arbitrary, but from the classifier HESN.  In the section of classifiers we will open the GESN classifier, we will deploy the 2017 edition, then ‚ÄúPart 1. Earthworks‚Äù - ‚ÄúSection 2. Other types of earthworks, preparatory, accompanying and fortifying‚Äù - ‚ÄúSubsection 2.1.  Soil compaction ‚Äù-‚Äú Soil compaction with 2.2 t vibratory rollers ‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6_/9o/zb/6_9ozbrijoem5er42ok36qahtoq.jpeg"><br><br>  Place the cursor on this position and drag the job to 1 section ‚ÄúPreparatory work‚Äù.  If necessary, use the work movement buttons to set it to position 1.2. <br><br>  After that, set the unit of measure - "m3" and the volume equal to 450 m3. <br><br><h4>  1.3.  Assignment of bound pricing and resources to work </h4><br>  Switch to the ‚ÄúPricing‚Äù tab of the Project Manager.  Place the cursor on the added job ‚Äú1.2.  Soil compaction using 2.2 t vibration rollers. ‚Äù  Make sure you have the classifier display enabled.  To do this, in the "View" menu, check the appropriate settings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/a3/2b/rb/a32brbdd6udrign0yjuiszyy2zs.png"><br><br>  In the classifier section at the bottom of the window, the ‚ÄúRelated quotations‚Äù section appears, if there are any for this work.  Open this section and select the quotation ‚ÄúSoil compaction with 2.2 t vibratory rollers per first pass in one track at a layer thickness of 40 cm‚Äù.  Holding the given price with the left mouse button, drag it to work ‚Äú1.2.  Soil compaction using 2.2 t vibration rollers. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zv/q0/1d/zvq01dejkmhfd7i58w9wyrk3v38.png"><br><br>  Pricing should appear with assigned resources under the specified work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/av/be/2d/avbe2dldulbjyd2elq9hxvhafzq.jpeg"><br><br><h4>  1.4.  Appointment of construction equipment to work </h4><br>  Switch to the "Technology" tab.  Place the cursor on the job ‚Äú1.2.  Soil compaction using 2.2 t vibration rollers. ‚Äù  In the lower part of the window, select the category ‚ÄúWaste Technique‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5_/bi/4m/5_bi4mhjgc14ox9yutcp2t_h5dy.png"><br><br>  In this example, randomly select a bulldozer from the list and drag it to the right side of the dialog.  A bulldozer will be assigned to work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9d/i2/f2/9di2f2wrh_gjztagudaqivvjnku.png"><br><br><h4>  1.5.  Assigning material to work </h4><br>  To assign materials to the selected work, switch to the technique tab.  In the list of works, select the work ‚Äú2.Opory‚Äù, in the classifier below select the required material ‚ÄúCrushed stone, gravel‚Äù and drag it to work.  It will appear in the list of materials on the right with the parameters already entered, except for the duration and values ‚Äã‚Äãof the need for the material. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9t/oo/fo/9toofovixmho6vhyyhkeznlldcq.jpeg"><br><br><h4>  1.6.  Export project in the estimate program </h4><br>  Works and information assigned to them can be downloaded for transfer to estimated programs.  There is a separate download for the Grand Estimates program and to the universal data exchange format for estimated programs - ARPS. <br><br>  To upload to the ARPS format, go to the Project-Export-ARPS 1.10 Manager dialog menu. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_1/l1/or/_1l1oryxlka8jpworerwhdhhvk4.jpeg"><br><br>  Save the file to your hard drive.  Similarly, you can do unloading for the Grand Estimates. <br><br><h4>  1.7.  Generation of bill of quantities </h4><br>  Switch to the ‚ÄúWorks‚Äù tab and select all works with the Ctrl + A keys. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hb/tq/na/hbtqnaucaex2yyfkhmcz7be2kz0.jpeg"><br><br>  Next, run the "Reports - Bill of Work" command and place the table in the drawing.  You can also get a statement of only the marked sections and work included in their composition. <br><br><h4>  1.8.  Generation of the list of machines and mechanisms </h4><br>  Similarly, select all the work and run the command "Reports - Sheet of machines and mechanisms."  Place the table in the drawing. <br><br><h4>  1.9.  Generation of work schedule </h4><br>  Select all works with the Ctrl + A keys.  Run the ‚ÄúReports on the production schedule‚Äù command.  In the settings dialog, set the time from 03/09/2012 to 07/28/2014.  Select a grouping by months, filling - fill. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mk/um/qh/mkumqh7ivhidwrqqyidf1azbckw.png"><br><br>  Place the received plan on the drawing. <br><br><h4>  1.10.  Generation of the schedule of the demand for machines and mechanisms </h4><br>  The schedule can be obtained by analogy with the previous schedule. <br><br><h4>  1.11.  Generating a workforce requirements schedule </h4><br>  Select all works with the Ctrl + A keys.  Run the "Reports - Workforce Needs Schedule" command.  Set the dates from 09/03/2012 to 07/28/2014 in the time settings dialog.  Wait for the generation of the schedule and place it on the drawing.  Set the schedule of labor movement below. <br><br><h4>  1.12.  Explanatory note generation </h4><br>  Run the "Reports - Explanatory Note" command.  Save the * .doc file to your hard drive, it will automatically open after that. <br><br><h3>  Theme 2. Design of the construction plan </h3><br>  In this topic, we will look at how to build the elements of the construction plan in the <a href="https://spds.club/funkcional-nanocad-spds-stroyploshchadka">nanoCAD SPDS Construction Site</a> . <br><br>  To work, you will need the file "\ Subject 2_Ogeneration of the CST \ Task \ CST. Dwg".  In the course of carrying out the exercises of this topic, we will launch all the commands from the main menu section ‚ÄúConstruction Site-Stroygenplan‚Äù, therefore, further teams will be written in abbreviated form, without specifying this part of the path.  To start the exercise, open the ‚ÄúSGP.dwg‚Äù file in the nanoCAD SPDS Construction Site. <br><br><h4>  2.1.  Construction site </h4><br>  From the menu ‚ÄúConstruction Sites‚Äù, run the command to build a construction site.  This element serves as a conditional identifier for the construction site so that subsequent designations can be assigned to a specific site on the plan.  In the dialog, select the ‚ÄúConstruction Site‚Äù icon.  In the properties, specify the name of the site - "Construction of a residential house", put the serial number - "1". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/x7/2j/9i/x72j9ifa3izpiozrpnfbamnczxu.png"><br><br>  Further on the drawing conditionally indicate the boundaries of the site.  This contour has nothing to do with real boundaries, since  the object itself serves only as an identifier for other construction site objects.  In the command options, select a rectangle and specify two diagonal points around the existing drawing objects.  The conditional border area by default is indicated in blue. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cq/ht/3_/cqht3_vgj_-md8ejpe7goqn54qc.png"><br><br><h4>  2.2.  The contour of the building being constructed </h4><br>  Build the contour of the building being constructed.  To do this, run the command "Buildings - Erected Building."  By default, the cursor in the classifier indicates the type of buildings we need.  In the dialog, specify the name of the building - ‚ÄúBuilding being erected‚Äù and give it a serial number ‚Äú2‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_e/cr/ih/_ecrihnvml8zuifgaxfc_jygjeu.png"><br><br>  For ease of operation, select the option of building a rectangle in the command options.  Specify the outline of the building as shown. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lc/n7/eg/lcn7egtuhw0wbdwloqxfyil1dbe.png"><br><br>  In this case, the dimensions of the building are indicated by us approximately, but in a real project everything is indicated exactly in size using various methods of construction. <br><br><h4>  2.3.  Household Identifier </h4><br>  The identifier of a domestic town plays a similar role as a site identifier.  It serves to determine whether the temporary buildings of a town belong to a particular town, since  there may be several of them in the drawing.  To add a household town, run the command ‚ÄúHousehold town-Household town‚Äù.  In the dialogue, select the pictograph of a household campus, give the town a name - ‚ÄúDomestic Town‚Äù, the sequence number ‚Äú3‚Äù.  Please note that the specified town to the construction site.  In our case, it is one, so it is not necessary to change this parameter.  For simplicity, select the method of constructing a rectangle and indicate the diagonal points on the drawing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nz/vl/6k/nzvl6kj9wdxmy9d0q5707ej3u_8.png"><br><br>  In our case, the boundaries of the domestic town are determined by us arbitrarily, as shown in the figure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vg/qg/ea/vgqgear365dkmmaylad0hwftf30.png"><br><br><h4>  2.4.  Temporary buildings of the town </h4><br>  For a domestic town defined by us, it is now necessary to affix temporary buildings.  Run the command "Household Town - Temporary Building."  In the classifier, you can search by name.  Choose "Sanitary-sanitary complex on 36 places (male)".  When you set the cursor, the name is transferred to the properties automatically.  Please note that the building belongs to a previously defined household town.  Be sure to check the inclusion box. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pe/2-/oz/pe2-oz4n_wfcfm8vluvj9zilsfk.png"><br><br>  Set for it the sequence number "1" and place on the drawing within the boundaries of the town.  Similarly, place other buildings, each time assigning the following sequence number: <br><br><ul><li>  Dining-dispensing for 36 seats; </li><li>  First-aid post; </li><li>  Construction headquarters; </li><li>  Toilet cabin "Standard"; </li><li>  Transformer substation power up to 630 kW. </li><li>  In the picture you can see the buildings of a domestic town with markers. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/de/bi/0c/debi0cecano2x9jixz7ykdiwdkw.png"><br><br><h4>  2.5.  Explication of temporary buildings </h4><br>  Launch the Project Manager via the main menu of the program.  In the Manager menu, call the construction of the explication through the menu "Reports - Explication of temporary buildings." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_i/lz/zs/_ilzzstoa5mbm76xy_zyrpnpepq.jpeg"><br><br>  In the site selection dialog, select "Household town". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pf/dp/y3/pfdpy3k8icynxxwxulk9_gmoxx4.png"><br><br>  Place the explication in the drawing as shown in the figure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9s/f-/u2/9sf-u2hn3qhtr_utnhoydenl8ra.png"><br><br><h4>  2.6.  Water network </h4><br>  We put down the designation of the external engineering network on the plan.  Run the command ‚ÄúNetworks - VK - Water supply‚Äù.  In the dialogue, select the icon "Temporary network of domestic water supply."  Pay attention to belonging to the construction site. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ul/np/ww/ulnpwwq1huikznpacou3knexd9y.png"><br><br>  Build an arbitrary polyline on the plan.  Select the line with the cursor.  Next to the first specified point, a special marker in the form of a cross will be visible.  Click on this marker and build along a line several wells. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/aj/dd/ye/ajddye7_bxmalvfzhcaytavydr0.png"><br><br><h4>  2.7.  Construction site fencing </h4><br>  Call the command "Fencing - Fencing".  You can choose arbitrarily the type of fence and give it a name in the properties of the first and second line.  Put a broken fence line around the construction site on the plan.  Use the snapping option when setting the last segment.  On the constructed line, click the special marker in the form of a cross and put down the gate mark along the fence. <br><br><h4>  2.8.  Safety signs </h4><br>  Commands for installing safety signs are invoked through the main menu of the program ‚ÄúConstruction Site - Signs - Safety Sign GOST 12.4.026‚Äù.  You can search for the desired character by name.  You can collect characters in a set and install them as a group in one command.  In this case, select the signs and install them one by one.  In this exercise, choose the signs arbitrarily.  To do this, find the desired character and double-click on it, place it in the "Selected characters" section at the top of the dialog. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ai/l3/6u/ail36ujmlrlbanmjctpo6vybufq.png"><br><br>  After that, click "OK" and place the mark on the drawing.  Repeat the operation for multiple characters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bq/g3/uf/bqg3ufrafhx76zp8oatoee-tqti.png"><br><br>  Run the Construction Site - Reports - Safety Signs Specification command.  Set the specification at the bottom of the drawing.  The specification is interactive.  You can, for example, delete one of the characters, and it will automatically be updated. <br><br>  Records of past webinars you can view on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-9GnBrgXOlmuCjBZvxDVWQ/videos">YouTube channel</a> . <br><br>  More information on <a href="https://spds.club/funkcional-nanocad-spds-stroyploshchadka">spds.club</a> <br><br>  <i>Olga Artemyeva, Head of Software Development Department</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fc/ex/ba/fcexbazbcy5emnx-cpbzr2kyblg.jpeg" width="300"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/449166/">https://habr.com/ru/post/449166/</a></p>
