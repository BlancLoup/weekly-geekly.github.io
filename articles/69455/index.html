I was not crippled, not offended.  Yes, deprived of property, but taken away the hard earned, but still not the material values ‚Äã‚Äãbecause of what it costs to open your brain. <br><br><h6>  The story continued </h6><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Today I returned home late in the evening.  Professional habit requires checking email even drunk at night on weekends.  Checking the mail, I found that the letters that 100% I have not seen have already been read (there were more than 20, most of which were reports that someone in the Habr√© commented on my post and 2 letters from the customer).  Then I discovered that all contacts were deleted in my skype, and all letters were deleted on another email account. <br><br>  <b>I understand that I acted like an idiot!</b>  <b>I instantly blocked the SIM card, but completely forgot about how much I had on my phone.</b>

      I was once again amazed at how much information we ourselves communicate to intruders about ourselves.  In addition to skype, two email accounts, a list of contacts, a calendar and a notepad in my phone, I also had a vkontakte reader and thismoment.  Having access to my account in the social.  network attacker gets access to the pages of users who are in my friends.  Getting access to my phone, a person sees the contacts of many people with their photos (you also upload photos for your contacts).  After finding out the address of my google mail, a person gets access to my business card (although why does he need it if there is a vkontakte).  It is terrible that involuntarily, I substitute not only myself, but also my relatives, friends, acquaintances, colleagues, etc.  Who knows what idiot might get into his head when he sees a beautiful girl's photo of a beautiful girl with her phone and home address in a freshly-picked phone (the latter is often easy to calculate through the social network or home phone number)? <br><br><h6>  Morality </h6><br>  Who said paranoia?  In terms of security, paranoia does not happen.  Put the phone on a password, do not save passwords, install anti-theft systems.  In the end, the phone is no longer just a phone. <br><br>  PS Called a friend.  His father is an operative.  They promised to punch the phone by IMEI. <br>  PPS It is actually interesting to hear the opinion of the community about how to protect your information and not deprive yourself of the comforts of modern civilization. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/69455/">https://habr.com/ru/post/69455/</a></p>
