In particular, US officials are warning wireless service providers in countries such as Germany, Italy and Japan. <br><br>  US officials are even considering the option of providing financial assistance to those countries and companies that will develop their network infrastructure without using the equipment of a Chinese company.  The problem is that the United States believes that Beijing is covertly spying on the critical information of American companies and government agencies. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In particular, Chinese telecommunications companies in countries where US military bases are located are causing concern.  The military has its own equipment, but some of the traffic still goes through networks with Chinese equipment. <br><br>  "We are trying to interact with countries from all over the world about our concerns regarding the cybersecurity of the telecommunications infrastructure."  In countries like Germany and Japan, network service providers often use equipment from Huawei and other Chinese suppliers.

      Previously, the United States blacklisted the company suppliers of equipment for state use.  Informally, business in the country has been advised not to work with Huawei as a partner.  This applies not only to network professional equipment, but also to mobile devices - for example, Mate and P smartphones from the same Huawei.  US operators do not offer their customers the device specified company.  In addition, Australia has banned the supply of Huawei equipment for use in its own networks, including 5G infrastructure. <br><br>  Six months ago, Huawei received a charge from the United States for supplying equipment to countries to which America prohibits the export of equipment of any type.  In addition to Huawei, in the United States a ban was imposed on the use of equipment from another Chinese manufacturer, ZTE.  In addition to supplies, both Chinese companies cannot buy technology in the United States, which puts their business at risk.  Huawei and ZTE use licensed technology in their smartphones, so the business of Chinese companies suffers. <br><br>  True, American companies also found themselves in an awkward position, many of which readily use the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/us-governments-beef-huawei-isnt-really-about-phones">relatively inexpensive</a> Huawei network equipment. <br><br>  As for the company itself, its representatives stated the following: ‚ÄúOur products and solutions are used in more than 170 countries, 46 out of the 50 largest telecom operators in the world, companies from the Forbes 500 list and millions of private customers.  The large number of our partners is due to the fact that they trust us and value our work.  Huawei is surprised by the actions of the American government.  We believe that our partners should decide for themselves whether or not to work with Huawei. ‚Äù <br><br>  Problems in the relationship between the US and telecommunications companies in China began a long time ago.  So, at the beginning of this year, the leaders of the six largest US intelligence agencies, speaking at Senate hearings, spoke out strongly against the use of Huawei and ZTE phones and tablets by US citizens.  Representatives of the CIA, the FBI, the NSA, and other special government organizations argue that the development of Chinese companies expose both American companies and citizens to unnecessary risks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c30/151/300/c30151300980a9870c308868508b09fb.jpg"><br><br>  "We are deeply concerned about the risks that arise when Americans use the devices and services created in a country whose government does not share our values," said FBI Chief Chris Wray. <br><br>  A few weeks ago, Bloomberg journalists <a href="https://habr.com/post/427541/">published</a> an article that Chinese manufacturers install spyware modules in the northern equipment.  In particular, the material was about a Chinese spy microchip installed on the motherboards of Supermicro servers.  This chip allows the Chinese to get any information with which the server works. <br><br>  Well, since the equipment Supermicro uses Apple, Amazon and other large companies, then, according to Bloomberg, such iron in general represents a threat to national security.  After the article was published, the companies whose names were mentioned in it, denied the words of journalists. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/431016/">https://habr.com/ru/post/431016/</a></p>
