Haha, no matter how.  Do you know this feeling when you postpone the order until the last moment, and then it turns out that the purchase will come at best in January?  (Or they promise to deliver it on December 30th, and bring it on March 30th. Meme is ridiculous, the situation is terrible) It‚Äôs better to order gifts in advance, but life happens, deadlines are stuck, we all understand.  Therefore, here is another Christmas gift collection of gadgets for those who did not have time, but really want to be in time. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  <a href="https://madrobots.ru/brands/foreo/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dny1802">Sonic Toothbrushes Foreo ISSA</a> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rk/wx/4e/rkwx4ekhovgm9pubaktvpkpaces.jpeg"><br><br>  The Swedish company Foreo produces futuristic-looking gadgets for beauty and cleanliness, including sound toothbrushes ISSA.

      The speed brushes are between ordinary electric and ultrasonic.  The devices beat the paste into a uniform foam, gently clean the enamel and the gaps between the teeth.  The minus of the electric brushes is that they need to be constantly charged, and every two or three months to change the head.  By the way, the ‚Äúmanual‚Äù brushes are correctly changed with the same frequency. <br><br>  Foreo developers have fixed both flaws.  The battery of their brushes lasts half a year or a year, depending on the model.  The housings are waterproof, ISSA brushes can brush your teeth even in the shower.  The heads are made of non-porous silicone, in which life does not start - bacteria and mold.  The bristles on the edges of the head are made of the same material, they do not injure the gums.  In the center of the bristles are bristles made of PBT-polymer for enhanced cleaning of enamel.  This hybrid head is designed for six months of use. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oi/ug/by/oiugby-ptcygxhi0ogubb76tk5o.jpeg"><br>  <i>From left to right: ISSA Play, ISSA mini 2, ISSA 2</i> <br><br>  The most current ISSA toothbrush models are <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/foreo-issa-play/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dny1802">ISSA play</a> , <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/foreo-issa-mini-2/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dny1802">ISSA mini 2</a> , <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/foreo-issa-2/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dny1802">ISSA 2</a> .

The session of the brush is a minute, it is divided into four segments.  Between them, the brush will remind you that it is time to clean the other quarter of the dental cavity.  ISSA mini 2 is suitable for adults and children over the age of 5 years old, who especially like the two smilies on the brush handle: sad and cheerful.  Cheerful lights up, if you brush your teeth, sad - if you do not touch the brush for 12 hours. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lj/3y/je/lj3yjedsjwyohloo1lgdjjgiuja.jpeg"><br><br>  For very young children aged 6 months and up to 6 years, there is a separate <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/foreo-issa-mikro/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dny1802">Foreo ISSA mikro</a> sonic toothbrush, with a silicone head without a PBT insert.

Smart garden iGarden LED provides all three components in the right proportions, so you can effectively grow greens, strawberries, tomatoes, lettuce and ornamental crops. <br><br>  In fact, iGarden LED is a small hydroponic that fits on a window sill.  If there is a red-hot battery under the windowsill, it is better not to put a garden on it.  The loss of sunlight from the window is not terrible, because the plants are illuminated by an LED lamp, which is attached to the side of the device case.  The height of the stand of the backlight is adjustable, and it works on a timer, providing a day length of about 16 hours. <br><br>  The water is poured into a separate tank and is economically consumed, the need for refilling a little more will remind the indicator light in hydroponics.  Plants are planted in two "pots", which are installed in the tank.  The substrate is the mineral vermiculite.  It already exists in hydroponics; if necessary, the stock can be replenished in any flower shop. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gt/st/4s/gtst4syji5cbt_q5mrmkkpex1pi.jpeg"><br>  <i>Smart garden iGarden</i> <br><br>  IGarden LED has another option called <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/igarden/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dny1802">iGarden</a> .  It does not have a backlight, otherwise it is exactly the same gadget.  Both devices are powered from the network. <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/nanoleaf-aurora-smarter-kit/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dny1802">Smart lighting system Nanoleaf Aurora</a> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ih/ud/6c/ihud6chcnjhotnwyvhe1zr3ikm8.jpeg"><br><br>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/madrobots/blog/411805/">We have already written</a> about the modular lighting system Nanoleaf Aurora.  Recall that this triangular LED panels that come together as a designer.  The resulting installation is glued to the wall (or ceiling) with a mounting tape.  The panels are light and do not fall off, so that the configuration can be changed at any time. <br><br>  Managed by Aurora from a smartphone, which connects via Wi-Fi.  In the mobile application, detailed color settings, animation panels are available, the schedule is set.  For the lazy there are pre-invented combinations.  All panels display 16.7 million colors, so the scope for creativity is huge. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6k/wa/kr/6kwakrshakmexowtquaq_tqx3qc.jpeg"><br><br>  The project of illumination was presented in 2016 at the exhibition of electronics CES.  Then the panels made a real sensation, and since then they have only gotten better and acquired new ‚Äúgadgets‚Äù.  The first is the <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/nanoleaf-aurora-rhythm/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dny1802">Nanoleaf Aurora Rhythm</a> light and music module.  He listens to the surrounding sounds and makes the panels ‚Äúdance‚Äù to the music.  Settings are set through the application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/t2/ax/ax/t2axaxm3e5xo08bdvvkbopootf0.jpeg"><br>  <i>Nanoleaf remote</i> <br><br>  The second is the <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/nanoleaf-remote/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dny1802">Nanoleaf Remote</a> , a control panel in the form of a dodecahedron.  Each of its faces is numbered, a ‚Äúscene‚Äù is attached to it: adjusting the colors and animation of the panels. Turn the gadget face up, and the Nanoleaf Aurora will change the scene.  The same trick works with the Homekit smart home settings. <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://madrobots.ru/brands/diy-house/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dny1802">Interior designers DIY House</a> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jd/gm/0k/jdgm0ktaxb7x3oelbrb35j3iswo.jpeg"><br><br>  We have already done a <a href="https://habr.com/company/madrobots/blog/416721/">detailed review</a> about interior designers at DIY House.  These are sets for assembling rumboks, miniature models of rooms with furnishings.  Each box contains the necessary materials - wooden elements, fabric, paper, glue, all sorts of trivia, and also paint, glue, brushes, tweezers and instructions.  Scissors and a stationery knife will need your own. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bi/pu/mb/bipumbookksqahnlvnpoksun62y.jpeg"><br><br>  Assembly takes several tens of hours.  The instruction is very detailed and fully translated into Russian, so there are no difficulties in the process, but it delivers a lot of pleasure.  If the <a href="https://madrobots.ru/brands/ugears/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dny1802">presented ones</a> like <a href="https://madrobots.ru/brands/ugears/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dny1802">Ugears</a> , then DIY House will be to their liking. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rl/22/-t/rl22-tawmjr50c4llhctc2fxaia.jpeg"><br><br>  Each set has a working backlight.  It must also be assembled from parts in a set, and then fixed on the diamond box.  The result is an incredibly beautiful toy and interior decoration.  By the way, new DIY House kits have appeared in our catalog.  Among the new arrivals there is a <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/diy-house-townhouse/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dny1802">three-story townhouse</a> and a <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/diy-house-kevins-studio/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dny1802">music studio with tiny instruments</a> . <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://madrobots.ru/brands/bellabeat/">Women's smart trackers Bellabeat Leaf Chakra and Leaf Urban</a> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jd/b5/hl/jdb5hln9vzgy5i2mz_i5ohbtzou.jpeg"><br><br>  <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/bellabeat-leaf-chakra/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dny1802">Bellabeat Leaf Chakra</a> and <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/bellabeat-leaf/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dny1802">Bellabeat Leaf Urban gadgets</a> look like ordinary jewelry.  In fact, this is smart jewelry - or smart trackers.  They are designed for women who want to monitor their health and activity, but do not want to spoil their style with a typical sports tracker. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fo/mm/sq/fommsq1qi9zhd6qsobpk0vbnafq.jpeg"><br>  <i>Bellabeat Leaf Urban</i> <br><br>  Bellabeat trackers count the number of steps taken, hours of activity and sleep.  The data is sent to a mobile application that processes them and analyzes them in detail.  In addition to analysis, it has the function of help with guided meditation, assessment of stress levels, and tracking of the menstrual cycle.  You can set a reminder to take a pill, or, conversely, to monitor the progress of pregnancy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lk/kq/sz/lkkqszhsm1lp8dlbrd_y-6v8wai.jpeg"><br>  <i>Bellabeat leaf chakra</i> <br><br>  Both smart decorations are made of stainless steel and wood composite, resembling a decorative stone.  Chakra is embellished with black onyx or rose quartz.
