Despite the demand for service in Russia, the Moscow authorities may ban it because of an unsigned agreement on the disclosure of taxi routes. <br><br>  The agreement is intended to resolve controversial issues for the Moscow authorities in the interaction of Uber with taxi drivers, but its agreement was delayed for several months.  According to the Deputy Mayor of Moscow, Maxim Liskutov, company representatives have been postponing the signing for several months in a row. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <blockquote>  ‚ÄúFirst: Uber is obliged to work only with legal taxi drivers who have permission for taxi activities.  And second: they will pass us data on the movement of their taxi cars around the city.  The data will be impersonal - we only need the tracks.  Uber were ready to sign such an agreement by the end of 2015.  Then, referring to their corporate procedures, they asked us to extend this period until the end of January.  And then their last request was to wait ten days - they again refer to their corporate procedures. <br><br>  If Uber does not sign the agreement, we will demand that its work in Moscow be banned, ‚ÄùLiskutov said in <a href="http://www.gazeta.ru/auto/2016/02/02_a_8053457.shtml">an interview</a> with Gazeta.ru. </blockquote><br><br>  The Gett and Yandex.Taxi services competing with Uber have agreed to transfer personal data on taxi cars and their employment.  According to Liskutov, this information is used to analyze traffic congestion.  Not only the city authorities are dissatisfied with the work of Uber - representatives of the Russian motorists federation applied to the FAS to check the taxi order services last year. <br><br>  Similarly <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2016/01/26/following-anti-uber-protest-french-government-announces-yet-another-law/">, protests</a> against Uber were carried out by taxi drivers in France, when the movement throughout the city was almost paralyzed because of several thousand protesters.  In addition to the civilized rally, some of the taxi drivers resorted to more radical methods, burning tires and blocking the routes to the airports, but this did not lead to a total ban on Uber in the country. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/730/ac3/21d/730ac321d28946eb86d52a5cb3813423.jpg"><br><br>  <b>PS</b> And Uber, meanwhile, <a href="https://newsroom.uber.com/celebrating-cities-a-new-look-and-feel-for-uber/">spent the rebranding</a> and updated the icon, as well as the animation of the download of your application. <br><br>  <b>PPS</b> During the <a href="http://govoritmoskva.ru/news/67564/">interview</a> for Moscow Talk, Liskutov shared his decision to give Uber another month to refuse to use the services of illegal taxi drivers. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúUnfortunately, federal legislation does not clearly regulate the work of Internet taxi aggregators.  We are forced to conclude additional agreements with companies.  I very much hope that Uber, such an international company, I am sure that striving to work within the law, will sign such an agreement with us.  I think that in the next month, if there is a decision, then accordingly.  If not, then we have the legal right and duty to contact law enforcement agencies and begin the procedure related to the prohibition of activity, ‚ÄùLiskutov shared with journalists. </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298380/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298380/</a></p>
