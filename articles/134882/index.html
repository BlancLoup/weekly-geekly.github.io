Personally, the situation is somewhat depressing: on the one hand, there is a lot of advertising information, on the other - few independent analytics and educational resources.  Let's try to understand this tukhlyak and its causes by analyzing Russian resources. <br><br><h4>  Let's start with "independent" </h4><br><h5>  CNews </h5><a name="habracut"></a><br>  About three years ago, with the support of <b>DocsVision,</b> a section called Doc.CNews or CNews appeared. Document circulation, judging from the information that, on the Russian market for SED, everything is extremely wonderful and optimistic.  A lot of press releases about the successful completion of large projects, machine-gun tapes of articles written in a single pattern: a problem or news on a topic, most often generated over the hill, plus comments from leading experts of the same leading companies. <habracut><br><br><h5>  PCWEEK </h5><br>  <a href="http://www.pcweek.ru/ecm/">PCWEEK.Document / ECM</a> Leading topics - Andrei Kolesov.  A group of journalists and experts from a well-known journal is trying to understand both the basics (terminology, standards) and conceptual issues (market conditions, trends).

    <h5>  Docflow </h5><br>  <a href="http://www.docflow.ru/forum/">The Docflow Forum is an</a> online platform for Russia's largest event in the subject area.  A couple of years ago, he brewed a pot, but they began to talk about his demise at the beginning of 2010.  <a href="http://www.docflow.ru/forum/forum4/topic9932/">www.docflow.ru/forum/forum4/topic9932</a> Today the forum is a sad sight: abandoned topics, rare posts and comments. <br><br><h4>  Pseudo-independent and dependent </h4><br><h5>  <b>Directum</b> company <b>blog</b> </h5><br>  Initially called Directum-journal.ru, it was then renamed <b>ECM-journal.ru</b> to make it industry-specific.  We must pay tribute to the organizers of the resource, the work on filling and supporting the resource is immense, many experts have been involved (though mostly from among the directum employees). <br><br>  Content is generated steadily, but discussions often come down to a small party.  Any dissent is harshly suppressed and actively moderated, which can be seen on the example of the <a href="http://ecm-journal.ru/post/Versionnost-dokumentov-v-prilozhenii-k-vizualnomu-kontentu.aspx">Versionality of Documents</a> topic <a href="http://ecm-journal.ru/post/Versionnost-dokumentov-v-prilozhenii-k-vizualnomu-kontentu.aspx">attached to visual content</a> . <br><br>  A couple of analytical articles sent to the blog was deeply reworked and emasculated, all references to competitors and ‚Äúdubious‚Äù moments in the moderators' opinion were removed. <br><br><h5>  <a href="http://ecm-community.livejournal.com/">Electronic Document Management Community</a> </h5><br>  The main objective of this resource is to promote the products of the customer of the blog - EOS company.  This blog also claims to be the industry-specific as ECM-journal.ru, so frankly advertising posts are interspersed with analytical articles by independent experts and press releases from other vendors. <br><br><h5>  <a href="http://e-dok.livejournal.com/">Interdisciplinary Expert Edition E.Dok</a> </h5>  belongs to the marketing pen of the company "Electronic Archive" (Elar) <br><br><h5>  <a href="http://rusrim.blogspot.com/">Natalia Khramtsovskaya blog</a> </h5><br>  The author is a recognized expert in the EDS market and is rightfully considered the most authoritative analytical person with a recklessly author's performance.  Nobody has such a number of translated materials, reports on visited thematic events and simply comments.  Natalia is an employee of the EOS company, but her position is as independent as possible.  Archivist and documentation officer to the bone. <br><br><h5>  Documentum </h5><br>  Since Documentum is part of the international concern EMC, its marketing is extremely problematic.  However, in the Runet are present: <br>  <a href="http://ecm-discovery.livejournal.com/">Albert Bertyakov</a> , consultant and teacher maintains a personal blog.  Comrade is extremely meticulous and scrupulous, has a broad outlook in the subject area.  He studied at his courses on ECM. <br>  <a href="http://my-documentum.blogspot.com/">My Documentum</a> , author Elena Strelkova, Marketing Director, Information Intelligence Group in EMC Russia and the CIS.  Sorry for this blog can not comment and write posts. <br><br><h5>  Blog <a href="http://www.elarchivo.ru/">All about electronic archives on ElArchivo.ru</a> </h5><br>  Recently launched a joint project of the consulting company DSS Consulting and our company ALEE SOFTWARE.  The goal is to analyze and structure the market of Russian electronic archives (Electronic records management). <br><br><h4>  Situation on Habr√© </h4><br>  There is no separate thematic blog on EDS.  By tags "SED" and "ECM" are scattered articles, questions and blogs of vendors. <br><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/cognitive/blog/">Cognitive Technologies</a> (developed by Euphrates EDS) <br>  The only attempt - the article " <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/cognitive/blog/133589/">Another SED or ...?</a> " Was otkhabrena and never received the promised continuation with details. <br><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/eos/blog/">Electronic Office Systems</a> (developer of SED ‚ÄúDelo‚Äù) <br>  A bright example of writing press releases on Habr√©.  Minimal comments, low ratings of articles. <br><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/alee/blog/">ALEE SOFTWARE</a> (developer SEA STOR-M) <br>  Not to say that everything is great, there is much to strive for. <br><br>  <b>IMHO, the reasons for the unpopularity of the subject of SED at Habr√©</b> : <br><ul><li>  <b>Inappropriate audience</b> .  The bulk of readers are technical experts, but there are almost no direct users of the CED - clerks and archivists;  besides, there are not so many leaders among the authors and readers of Habr who make decisions on the implementation of the SED. </li><li>  <b>The reluctance of developers ogrebat negative for their systems</b> .  The technological implementation of many EDS leaves much to be desired: outdated platforms, terrible interfaces with numerous tables and fields, kondovo and the reluctance of developers to use new technologies.  Nevertheless, the developers of the SED react to Habr.  So, a post called <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/usabilitylab/blog/114412/">Why do users hate EDS?</a>  caused a <a href="http://ecm-journal.ru/post/Pochemu-polzovateli-nenavidjat-SEhD-ot-Usability-Lab.aspx">serious resonance in the SED circles</a> .  Soon followed and the response of market participants.  CompanyMedia: they <a href="http://www.cnews.ru/reviews/index.shtml%3F2011/12/12/468634">showed the market the SED interface from Studio Lebedev</a> , though I didn‚Äôt see these interfaces anywhere, and it would be interesting not only for me.  Cognitive Technologies has used the services of Usethics on the same issue. </li><li>  <b>A marketing error in the form of Habr's perception of one of the blog platforms</b> (Blogger.com, LJ) and, as a result, the task of working with a corporate blog for a PR manager who is not well aware of the SED issues and therefore unable to prepare materials that are really interesting to the target audience. </li><li>  Even in a large SED company, <b>it is difficult to find a technical specialist</b> who can be <s>made</s> <s>interested in</s> attracting articles to Habr√© to posting, and writing interesting articles is generally a special gift or art. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>What are we going to do to improve the situation and recommend to others:</b> <br><br><ol><li>  Considering the interdisciplinary subject area, to <b>involve specialists from different areas</b> (document scientists, archivists, standardizers, IT specialists, managers) in writing articles and commenting </li><li>  <b>Translate thematic foreign materials</b> from sites such as AIIM. </li><li>  <b>Post author articles of</b> interest to the target audience.  There are few who are interested in the next rebranding of the product.  It is much more interesting to read about technological platforms, problems and solutions during the development, installation, operation of systems.  A vivid example is an article <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/java/112198/">about the experience of implementing the Alfresco document management system</a> . </li><li>  <b>Ask questions to</b> developers and readers, preferably uncomfortable to try <b>to get answers to them</b> . </li></ol><br><br>  And what do you think, what is the reason for SED-tukhlyak on Habr√©?  And what would be interesting for you to read and discuss on the above mentioned topics? </habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/134882/">https://habr.com/ru/post/134882/</a></p>
