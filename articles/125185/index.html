Because I was confident in the quality of the products of this company.  This time I was wrong. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  February 25, 2011 I bought a monoblock ASUS ET2010AGT-B063E in Sochi.  When I turned on the monoblock for the first time, at the moment when I connected the scanner to the rear USB port, it turned off.  I tried to turn it on with the button and it turned on.  I did not pay attention to this strange case.  Further, this situation manifested itself again two times.  I decided that this was apparently a minor defect of this device and since it didn‚Äôt interfere much with the work, I simply tried not to insert the USB device into the included computer once again. <br><br>  May 4, 2011 monoblock stopped turning on.  He broke down. <br><br>  For 2 months of use, I managed to transfer all my working space to a monoblock and understood very well that if I put it into service, the issue of repair would be delayed for many months.  In addition, I bought it in the Sochi branch of the store, and their service is located in the city of Krasnodar.

      Violating the terms of the guarantee, I took the risk and tried to repair the candy bar myself.  I went to this step for one sole reason: all my work was inside the all-in-one, I did not have a spare computer at that time, and for me the speed at which the work computer was restored was important. <br><br>  For two hours, we managed to find a closed transistor in one of the motherboard circuits.  The transistor was replaced by an analog, but it did not give results.  The computer started to turn on, but after a while it spontaneously turned off.  No other obvious defects were found.  And due to the lack of original spare parts and diagnostic equipment, I decided to send the computer to a service for paid repair.  At the same time identified the identified fault. <br><br>  Began months of anxious waiting.  First, the service center ordered a motherboard to ASUS, when it arrived, it turned out that the replacement of the board is not required.  And the reason for the inoperability of the monoblock is a failed microprocessor.  We ordered a microprocessor in ASUS.  They promised to deliver in 2 weeks.  Then they said that he was stuck on the border with China (problems with customs) and would come in a few weeks, and then completely killed by a quote from ASUS: ‚ÄúUnfortunately, the part for this repair is no longer supplied to Russia.  Please close the repair. ‚Äù  This is despite the fact that the computer was released less than a year ago and is modern. <br><br>  Almost three months have passed since the computer was sent to the service.  ASUS deftly washed his hands when I needed help in restoring a defective device.  This brand no longer exists for me. <br><br>  I will be glad to advice in overcoming this situation.  I tune myself to an independent order of a microprocessor from the same China. <br><br>  <i><b>10:28</b> For some reason, the majority of readers perceived the post as attacks in the direction of the ASUS technology.</i>  <i>This is not true.</i>  <i>I just want to draw your attention to the situation when a node fails in your modern machine, and the official manufacturer refuses to supply you with this node.</i>  <i>Failure after all could occur in the post-warranty period.</i>  <i>In this case, no compensation would follow.</i>  <i>And if you do not have the opportunity to order a rare microprocessor abroad - accept the fact that repair will not be possible.</i>  <i>And the manufacturer will only spread his hands.</i> <br><br>  <i><b>08/23/11</b> The processor came in the USA on eBay.</i>  <i>Replaced.</i>  <i>Hooray, the computer is working again.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/125185/">https://habr.com/ru/post/125185/</a></p>
