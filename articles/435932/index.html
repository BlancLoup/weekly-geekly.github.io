It is with them and problems.  There‚Äôs no need to prove anything, everything lies on the surface, but just in case I‚Äôll give a couple of theses.

      If you have sales problems, you need a change.  Obviously?  It seems yes.  Either the products you sell are not the ones that are needed by the market, or there are too few of them, or too much, or you have deadlines, or the quality is unacceptably low, or the sellers are rude to customers - it does not matter, this is the reason.  In order for these reasons to stop influencing the sales system, changes are needed. <br><br>  If you have supply problems, you need a change.  Obviously?  It seems yes.  Or it is necessary to find suppliers of others, or to form orders more often, or perhaps less often, or to reduce lots, or to improve logistics, or to stop using hired transport, or to start using hired transport.  It is not so important what exactly needs to be changed, but something needs to be changed. <br><br>  If you have problems with automation, then you need changes.  Obviously?  It seems yes.  Or change the platform, or take another software product, or hire programmers, or disperse programmers, or find a decent outsourcer (haha), or stop using the collective farm integrator and hire a federal one, or send feds and find an enthusiastic fan in your village, or reconsider IT management, or change programmer motivation.  It doesn't matter what, but something needs to be changed. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Here zamylennost obvious writing?  Thanks, Cap?  After all, the phrase, or the thought ‚Äúit is necessary to change something‚Äù is so obvious, so often arises in the head or at meetings, that there is no reason to repeat it?  Alas, there is a sense, because further the phrase "it is necessary to change something" usually does not work.  Why? <br><br>  Because it is not clear what exactly needs to be changed, what to change, why it is necessary to change, and why not change it, and why we change it, and not theirs, and whether it becomes worse, but we have no experience, and crap it's all, but it can not be that it helped, etc. <br><br><h4>  Common script </h4><br>  The situation above is often repeated after the next <a href="https://habr.com/post/354798/">‚Äúcrackdown‚Äù of a</a> manager or owner.  He angrily asserts ‚Äúit is necessary to change something‚Äù, issues instructions, requires a list of activities, a new strategy, change projects, cost reduction (as a first project), staff reduction (as a second project), consultants (and what to do if yours are mediocrity). <br><br>  Further, the bureaucratic machine dampens the director's impulse.  The easiest way is to wait until the boss calms down and takes care of the operative, and forgets about the changes. <br><br>  The second way is to come up with activities for which he will not go for objective reasons, such as buying expensive equipment, or an information system, or attracting qualified specialists. <br><br>  The third way is to come up with activities for which he will not go for subjective reasons, such as ‚Äúchanging the system at the root‚Äù, ‚Äúsolving painful problems‚Äù, ‚Äústarting a new life on Monday‚Äù, etc. <br><br>  The fourth way is to ‚Äúheal‚Äù with a surrogate, such as introducing CRM in response to poor sales, introducing 5S in response to poor production, buying ERP in response to poor planning, developing a bonus system in response to low discipline, etc. <br><br>  It is easy to put out the fuse for change by such methods.  And if it is easy, then why not - because quenching methods are so popular.  But the problem remains in place - no change.  And all, I beg your pardon, Shobla lives calmly until the next crisis, when the leader again "gets the reins under the tail." <br><br>  Often, after such perturbations, a paradoxical conclusion appears: we are fine, we don‚Äôt need to change anything, we <i>just have to work better</i> .  Although even banal logic says that ‚Äúit is better to work‚Äù is a change.  Anyway. <br><br>  Why it happens?  The answer, it seems, is obvious - banal, boring, elementary incompetence. <br><br><h4>  And again managers </h4><br>  The leader, after all, with whom is he talking about the changes, from whom does he demand, who sets the task of ‚Äúcoming up with an event‚Äù?  <i>Managers</i> .  And most of them, alas, <i>do not know how</i> to make changes.  Well, that is, <b>they</b> do not know how.  Not that they prefer not to do them, or do not like to do them, or reluctance to bother.  Just <i>do not know how</i> , that's all. <br><br>  They do not know what needs to be changed, what needs to be changed, how to change.  Why, they do not even understand that something needs to be changed at all (as long as they are not stumbled by the nose).  They simply do not have such <i>competence</i> .  To force such a manager to change something is the same as forcing an accountant to program.  Of course, rummaging through the Internet, shedding a bucket of tears on your fate, and having terrorized all the familiar programmers, an accountant will do something, if he does not quit before, but who needs it, such programming? <br><br>  Many managers, by the way, act in a similar way (in the sense of leaving), if the pressure from the upstream on the topic of changes increases, and the damping does not work, i.e.  unable to absorb the perturbation or take him away from himself.  You must have come across this.  They crush him, the poor, crush him, he somehow slips away, he creates visibility, he runs for a while, he spins, he speaks beautiful words.  And then, when you no longer have to endure urine, they kick it out. <br><br>  After all, why are managers fired?  If we reject the few cases of drunkenness, corruption, retirement and outright failures in current activities, then what remains?  <i>No change</i> . <br><br>  The head of the sales department does not fulfill the plan, and was he fired for it?  For what?  For failure to plan?  No, for <i>not changing the</i> work of the sales department so that it can carry out the plan. <br><br>  OTK chief constantly misses the marriage, and customer complaints forced him to dismiss?  Why was he fired?  For a marriage pass?  For customer complaints?  No, for <i>not changing the</i> work of the Quality Control Department so that the marriage does not go through. <br><br>  The head of the IT department has not been able to complete the transition to the new system for two years, and he was fired for it?  For not completing the transition?  No, for <i>not changing the</i> work of the IT department so that the transition is complete. <br><br>  The answer is obvious, if you look a little deeper, is not it?  Moreover, only one level deeper. <br><br><h4>  Business as a system </h4><br>  Any department, team, division, department, business unit, business as a whole is a system.  The system produces a product - no matter what.  In order not to bother with the structure of the product, we define it <i>this</i> way: <i>this is a system that produces a certain amount of a quality product per unit of time</i> . <br><br>  The sales department makes sales for a certain amount per month.  Or generates income at a certain amount per month, as you like.  Or it generates a certain amount of receipts to the organization‚Äôs account per month, it‚Äôs up to you to decide what to consider as a product of the system. <br><br>  This system has bandwidth - it can not generate a product more than its limit.  Variability is different everywhere, depending on the system and product.  For example, the sales department can sometimes come across a gold mine, in the form of a loyal customer, or sell an expensive product once a year.  We will not consider such impulse results, in the average figure they will be smeared. <br><br>  Normal, i.e.  bad manager, puts himself in charge of this system.  It pretends that the system cannot function without it, ties up key information flows, becomes the most important link in this system.  If you remove all unnecessary words, he gets <i>inside the system</i> , becomes its element. <br><br>  And here we have a system, of which the manager is a part, and it produces a product. <br><br>  There is the same uproar - the head of a higher level makes claims, says: ‚Äúsomething needs to be changed‚Äù.  What is the essence of the claim at the system level?  The manager is not satisfied with the performance of the system.  Here, of course, the ‚Äúsystem efficiency‚Äù is more accurate, which also takes into account the cost of productivity, but this does not change the essence: the system, the system itself, is bad.  The system needs to be changed to change its performance. <br><br>  How can this worst manager change the system?  Not in the sense of "well, now we will understand what and how he should change," but in the sense of "how is this even possible?".  He does not know how, in general.  He does not see any system.  He sees people, tables, computers, machine tools, walls, toilet, etc.  Elements sees, systems - no. <br><br>  He does not understand the relationships, he has never heard parts of the system either, he has never heard about the laws of the systems, he has no idea about leverage, he hasn‚Äôt watched the video even about vulgar ‚Äúlow-hanging fruits of efficiency‚Äù. <br><br>  He is a pure <i>user of the</i> system.  He uses the business system in the same way that he uses a refrigerator, microwave, car, telephone, social networks, email, etc.  As it is now fashionable to say, he is a child of the era of consumption, and he consumes the business system in the same way as a dishwasher. <br><br>  Position manager for him - just a lucky coincidence.  In most cases, he is simply a former employee of the department, which he now heads.  He came across the director a little more often, laughed a little more loudly at his jokes at the corporate party, behaved a little more actively on the clean-up, well, or just worked the best - as a salesman, supplier, programmer, designer. <br><br>  He was and, probably, will again become the best element of this system, but he will not even notice the system itself, as well as its presence in general. <br><br>  What will he do if he doesn't run away right away?  Here, too, everything seems to be obvious. <br><br><h4>  Meaningless changes </h4><br>  What does the user, for example, the information system, when he can not achieve the desired result and no one to ask?  That's right, he starts to <i>"poke" and "try</i> . <i>"</i>  Change the available settings, refill documents, retransmit, distribute, change the values ‚Äã‚Äãof the details and tables of the document, etc. <br><br>  The computer user behaves similarly - poking at everything.  Just try, for the sake of interest, to a person who does not have much knowledge in the computer, set the task to increase productivity so that the computer does not slow down.  What will he do?  Games will remove.  Movies will remove.  Generally remove everything that he put there for their non-working purposes.  Hard disk cleaning will start (if found).  It may even reinstall the operating system.  Download and distribution of torrents off.  Well, etc. <br><br>  Exactly the same behavior of the manager.  First of all, ryknet on their subordinates - "work, fu *, e * che."  Will take everything personally in control.  Get everyone to report daily on the work done.  Organizes revision of projects.  He will arrange a meeting where he will squeeze out motivational speeches with great effort.  Or try to portray the bad guy.  He will begin the usual managerial tantrum, the essence of which is to poke all the available levers of the system, <i>in the hope</i> that one of them will lead to changes.  Do you understand?  ‚ÄúIn hope,‚Äù not ‚Äúwith purpose.‚Äù <br><br>  If it is a little more adequate, it will get on the Internet (as an adequate computer user, for example).  Looks for: ‚Äúhow to increase sales‚Äù, ‚Äúacceleration of software development‚Äù, ‚Äúmethods of reducing procurement costs‚Äù, ‚Äúoptimization of business processes‚Äù.  What will he find? <br><br>  Unlike the ‚Äúperformance improvement of windows 10‚Äù query, it will not find clear instructions, or even a clear description of the reasons for the poor performance of its business system.  He will find books, courses, software products, consultants and consulting companies, as well as a success story about how someone used such and such a method and everything went well for him. <br><br>  What will the manager do next?  I would like, of course, that he read books, rethink and analyze his system, and ask more correct questions, but this will not happen.  He will simply choose what is <i>simpler</i> and make it. <br><br>  For example, enrolled in courses and seminars.  Sometimes this is enough for the boss to fall behind, you just need to correctly present.  ‚ÄúI realized that the sales department needs major changes, at the system level, which cannot be done without serious preparation, and decided to start with myself - from September I start studying at the MBA.‚Äù  If you manage to pass the MBA at the expense of the company, then the buzz is double.  But the main thing - there will be a <i>delay</i> in changes in 2 years. <br><br>  The path of the introduction of any new software product is also often found.  At a minimum - a new round of internal automation, with the statement of the task to the IT department like ‚Äúmake me a serious balanced scorecard‚Äù.  Director, I beg your pardon, slogans from the advertising brochures of this product, like ‚Äúcosts will decrease‚Äù, ‚Äúreal control over projects‚Äù will appear, etc. <br><br>  If the system is too expensive, and the director refuses - even better.  Then for a long time, in response to the next meeting, it will be possible to answer: ‚ÄúWell, you didn‚Äôt let me implement the program, it would solve our problems‚Äù.  And if the director agrees, then, again, there is a <i>time lag</i> - while there is an introduction, no one has the moral right to demand the results of the changes.  As a result, there is another surrogate product. <br><br>  Sometimes the manager turns to consultants.  Here the situation is even worse, at least in Russia.  Universal consultants who understand the entire business system or not, or very little, and for very large sums of money (for example, a budget of 20 million rubles from consultants well-known throughout Russia for ‚Äúidentifying problems and ways to solve them‚Äù is quite normal).  Ordinary consultants do not have the main competence - to understand <i>what the problem is</i> . <br><br>  For example, a consultant specializes in the theory of constraints (TOC).  Beautiful, wonderful and very powerful technique.  But it is not universal (like any other).  But the consultant does not know anything else and does not know how.  He does a lot of preliminary work, which always looks about the same - gathering employees, talking to everyone, brainstorming, writing down problems, drawing a map / thunderclouds / qualification / swimming lanes, etc.  - no matter how it is called in a specific method.  Well, to give a result - you need to implement TOC. <br><br>  If the consultant specializes in the development of motivation systems, he will say that you need to change the motivation system.  If his bread is an ISO implementation, then an ISO implementation will be the solution.  If it works with ITIL, then get ready to implement ITIL.  Etc. <br><br>  If the consultant owns a group of similar techniques, then there will be at least some choice.  For example, more or less sensible quality management consultants can advise both ISO, Lean, and 5S, and 6 sigma, because all these techniques belong to the same area of ‚Äã‚Äãexpertise, and are based on one source (from which all have grown). <br><br>  As a result, the company will implement a methodology <i>that the consultant knows</i> .  It will help, it will not help - no one knows, and this is not important (especially the consultant).  Because, as a result of the implementation, the consultant has a standard excuse - you are fools yourself. <br><br>  Just end, for example, almost all of the implementation of 1C by the franchisee.  You do not think that at the first meetings with the managers, and during the subsequent survey of the company (for your money), the French employees are looking for answers to the questions ‚ÄúWhat are the problems of the company?  How can they be solved?  Do they really decide the implementation of 1C?  Or is there another problem?  Or maybe it's not 1C more suitable? ".  All that interests them is to write more functional requirements, so that the technical task for revision is more weight-bearing and the budget is larger. <br><br>  Well, the easiest, least costly in terms of money and consequences is ‚Äúto do like that guy.‚Äù  Having read the success story, the manager decides to use <i>the same method</i> .  This approach is somewhat similar to self-healing folk remedies.  Without an understanding of the causes, interrelations, consequences, harm - simply ‚Äúattach the left heel to the right ear on the winter solstice day, lying on the balcony of a neighboring apartment in a necklace of poop gibbon‚Äù.  And what will help? <br><br>  So there are daily RAM, rearrangement of tables, purchase of candy bars, dress code for employees, white and cork boards on the wall, flowers on window sills, plans and checklists for the day, spontaneous groups in vatsap and vibers, etc. <br><br><h4>  Summary </h4><br>  You probably do not agree with what I wrote.  Or why I wrote it.  Or with the person to whom I wrote it, or as I wrote it, or why I wrote it. <br><br>  You probably think that I‚Äôm wrong, and managers are great professionals who can solve any system problem in a company, eliminate conflicts, enter new markets, speed up product development, reduce stocks, get rid of deficiencies, increase customer loyalty, improve product quality, etc. <br><br>  I will not argue and persuade, these are your managers, your business, your responsibility.  I will only ask the test question: if they are able to do all this, why not? <br><br>  You can check whether or not I‚Äôm right about your managers with the help of simple questions: <br><br>  1. Where the manager is in charge, are there any problems that bother you? <br>  2. Do these problems bother you for a long time? <br>  3. Did the manager do something to solve them? <br>  4. What did he do to solve the problem? <br><br>  When answering, it is not the speculation that is important, but the facts - you answer not to me, but to yourself. <br><br>  I just want you to think about whether or not people trust change. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/435932/">https://habr.com/ru/post/435932/</a></p>
