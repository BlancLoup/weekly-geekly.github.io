Solid excitement and anxiety.  So, at present, in the world of intellectual technologies and GPS gadgets, the ability to track the location of your child at school, during classes in circles and on walks, gives modern parents the key to control and peace of mind at the same time. <br><br>  Therefore, the developers of the phone-clock with the function of the tracker " <a href="http://www.icover.ru/catalog/product/fixitime_smart_watch_detskie_chasy_telefon_black/">Elari FixiTime</a> ‚Äù made sure that parents were comfortable in communicating with the child, and children, in turn, were interested in and easy to use the watch-phone as a real ‚Äúspy gadget‚Äù, whose appearance reflects the history of the famous cartoon series "Fixiki", where men living in technology not only fix it, but also help children learn the principles of operation of various devices. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/adb/51e/2d6/adb51e2d6641413a94102b1e21f364ee.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  With ‚ÄúFixitime‚Äù, children have the opportunity to plunge into the country of their favorite heroes, and to be in touch with loved ones, which is important for safety and comfort, and of calm parents, of course.

The box also contains basic instructions that duplicate information from the booklet included in the kit. <br><br>  <b>Equipment:</b> <br>  - FixTime smart watch (available in two colors - black and pink) <br>  - Charger with microUSB connector <br>  - User's Manual <br><br>  To work hours need a SIM-card of any operator, which is purchased separately. <br>  Wherecom application is downloaded separately, the application is free for Apple and Android devices. <br><br><h2>  Design </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cc2/eaa/5d7/cc2eaa5d7e8b4ec5b46798caf93c7642.JPG"><br><br>  Thanks to a fairly simple design, small users will easily and quickly ‚Äúsort out‚Äù the new gadget.  On a small screen 0.64 inches time, charge level and signal are displayed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9a4/fc4/ce6/9a4fc4ce69ab487d87c1a1f1bab50244.jpg"><br><br>  The required 4 buttons are located on the front panel, which makes it easy to use the clock: <br><br>  1. Power off / on / off <br>  2. Tel 1 - button for dialing a phone number (for example, mother) <br>  3. Tel 2 - button for dialing a phone number (for example, dad) <br>  4. SOS - in one click of this button, parents will receive a notification with a 15-second record of what is happening around.  (This information will help orient yourself in the setting; perhaps the child pressed the button accidentally). <br><br>  Also on the left side of the watch-phone there are 2 slots: for micro-sim and USB-port for charging the device.  The microphone of the device is located directly on the front panel, which makes the sound clearer. <br><br><h2>  Functional </h2><br>  So, what functions of Fixitime children's watches will make parents life quieter, and making children safer?  Having installed the free Wherecom application for Android and IOS on your smartphone and setting up this gadget, <br><br>  <b>Parents can</b> <br>  - track the exact location on the map by GPS (outside buildings) and LBS (inside buildings).  You can also use for trips to the huge shopping centers and not be afraid of losing the child out of sight; <br>  - receive notification of whether the child is out of the allowed zone.  Which of the children is not thinking about skipping lessons.  The ability to track the movement in a certain time period gives the tracking function; <br>  - keep in view up to 20 ‚ÄúFixitime‚Äù devices, which is important for families in which there is more than one child; <br>  - call the clock from the allowed numbers specified in the application, other numbers <br>  - set phone numbers for shortcut buttons Tel.  1 and Tel.  2 <br>  - view tracker movement history <br><br>  <b>Children can</b> <br>  - call two bound numbers by pressing one of the buttons (Tel.1, Tel 2) <br>  - notify about emergency situation thanks to the SOS button <br>  - receive calls only from trusted phones added to the ‚Äúwhite list‚Äù, which can be up to 20 <br><br><h2>  Setup and preparation for work </h2><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d19/e8c/3b9/d19e8c3b93dc4c1391c555fae9ddff80.png"><br><br>  Preparing the watch for work is very simple, just install a SIM card in the slot, everything else can be configured in the above application. <br><br>  Using the application, you can set up phone numbers for calls, an area, upon leaving the territory of which a corresponding notification will be sent to the parents' mobile phone, and this zone can be configured for a specific time period.  For example, in this way it is possible to trace whether a child is skipping school or has gone far from the yard.  Also, this application allows you to track the child's location both on the street, using GPS, and indoors, using LBS, but in the second case, the tracking will be approximate, since the accuracy of LBS tracking is up to 50 meters. <br><br>  It is worth noting that FixTime is ready for the devastating impact of the elements on <s>children</s> :) - they have protection against direct splashes and moisture of IP55 level.  Yes, and break the body will be quite difficult - it is rubberized and sturdy.  Pleasant to the touch and without protruding sharp parts. <br><br><h2>  Verdict </h2><br>  As a result, we get <a href="http://www.icover.ru/catalog/product/fixitime_smart_watch_detskie_chasy_telefon_black/">an inexpensive</a> device that allows you to always be calm for the child, and the child gets a handy accessory with spy functions, turning simple phone calls into an interesting game. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/366279/">https://habr.com/ru/post/366279/</a></p>
