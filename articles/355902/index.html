  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The new bill limits the communication of Russians in messengers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Officials have developed a bill regulating the work of instant messengers in Russia.  The authors of this bill propose to amend the laws "On Information ..." and "On Communication."  The bill introduces a new concept of ‚Äúinformation and communication services‚Äù - ‚Äútext, voice, and picture messaging services that are technologically inextricably linked to communication services provided by third parties on data transmission networks of telecom operators,‚Äù Vedomosti <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2015/12/09/620206-chinovniki-ogranichit-messendzherah">writes</a> .  According to the employees of telecommunications companies, who were able to familiarize themselves with the text of a copy of the draft law, this is, first of all, about instant messengers.  In addition, it is quite possible that social networks will fall under the law - after all, they can also exchange messages. <br><br>  The bill proposes to oblige the developers of such services to work under an agreement with telecom operators.  In addition, companies will be required to notify Roskomnadzor about their work.  If the service violates the law or the terms of the contract with the operator, the latter must block the service traffic until the problem is corrected. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the bill itself, the messengers are called ‚Äúorganizers of information dissemination,‚Äù who ‚Äúmust provide reception and transmission of messages in the networks of operators.‚Äù  In this case, the exchange of messages, according to the authors of the document, should take place only between the identified users.  Thus, the instant messenger must independently identify users, as well as limit unwanted mailings of mass messages and information, which is distributed in violation of the law.  Such information may be spam, and, for example, unwanted political advertising during elections. <br><br>  According to an employee of one of the telecommunications companies who was able to familiarize themselves with the text of the bill, the state wants to make control over such services more stringent.  And nobody wants to challenge such an initiative.  The developer of the bill is Roskomnadzor, according to sources familiar with the bill.  Already, the document is being discussed in a special commission, whose members are officials and representatives of telecom operators.

      Roskomnadzor, in turn, fulfills the instructions of the presidential administration, which considers it necessary to regulate such services in connection with a complex geopolitical situation.  A source close to Roskomnadzor confirmed the initiative of the Kremlin, as well as the fact that Roskomnadzor experts participate in the preparation of the relevant document. <br><br>  The bill itself, according to another source, was developed because most of the companies that develop instant messengers do not have a representative office in Russia.  Accordingly, it is very difficult, if at all possible, to influence them.  Consequently, the legislators proposed to create a mechanism for blocking problem messengers - and this mechanism is in many ways similar to the mechanism for blocking websites that violate the law. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/355902/">https://habr.com/ru/post/355902/</a></p>
