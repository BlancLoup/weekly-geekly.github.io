Personally, I listen to music very often, starting in the morning when watching news, moving around the city, and in the evening, resting at home.  Naturally, at home, I listen to music either through my Macbook Pro, or through Apple TV, depending on the situation, and on the road, my iPhone or iPod plays my favorite tracks. <br><br>  However, there are such cases when the power of a laptop or iPhone is not enough and something is louder and you need a large speaker.  Or in nature (very soon, as the snow melts) I want to disperse the protein or fat after the kebab, or in the country to give a light to the neighbors!  :) Of course, this is a joke, but ... Today, my guest is an interesting gadget - PartyFON MAX vibrodynamics from Dadget, which will help me in fulfilling my desires! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6af/732/344/6af73234485447b58f581b53b2d7c55a.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>What is a PartyFON MAX vibrator?</b>

      For a start, you just need to understand what a vibrator is.  We all know about headphones, speakers and speakers.  They are of different shapes, sizes, ways of connection, they have different technical characteristics and so on.  Most of them are the end device, which we connect in one way or another to a computer / player / radio and enjoy the sound.  But the vibrator is a ‚Äúbridge‚Äù connecting your computer or iPhone directly to the sound source!  It sounds tricky, but in reality everything is simple: such a speaker works on the principle of vibration (as its name implies), which is fixed on any flat surface, which, in turn, is already the source of sound.  That is, just holding this vibrator in your hand you will not hear anything pleasant, only muffled squeaking and vibration in your hand, but when you put it on the table, you will feel a sickly tide of sound wave power! <br><br>  <b>Unpacking vibrocolumn PartyFON MAX</b> <br><br>  That box came to me with a column.  Packaging looks neat and stylish, and already in the box it becomes clear what is inside :).  There are several elements waiting for us inside: the speaker itself, the suction cup for mounting on a flat surface, the fixed mount (screwed onto 3 self-tapping screws), and the cable for charging the speaker battery, which is also an audio cable in combination.  It seems to be all there, but personally I would add to the kit also a small carrying case.  Is the vibrating column designed to carry with you all the time, and would the cover be very useful? <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/159172849&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgyzI9GPEXrt_uFDXlw-Sil2VcUdA" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="Unpacking PartyFon Max from AppleProfi.ru" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The column itself is made of black matte plastic, pleasant to the touch. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f8a/6fa/df1/f8a6fadf1a164f279fe318931883cf9c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/757/3a5/f85/7573a5f85a194d63aae2f0178c0589cc.jpg"><br><br>  Alas, fingerprints remain on the case, and it is easy to scratch or stain it.  That is why it is necessary to put in the kit a small rag bag for transportation! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f11/5b9/887/f115b9887355499eb8cb37744d3dc219.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eab/a56/655/eaba56655648406f93aab7eaa1e3cff2.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Connecting PartyFON MAX vibrator to Mac and iPhone</b> <br><br>  We got it, unpacked - it's time to connect to any device and start enjoying the sound!  I have an iPhone and a Macbook on hand, but since there is more music on a Mac, I‚Äôll send music to the speaker from it.  First you need to turn on the Macbook Bluetooth and move the switch on the column to BT mode.  The column is connected very quickly and if everything went well, the PartyFON will quietly squeak.  After that, you can safely launch any song in iTunes, a movie or video from YouTube.  It is possible that when you first turn on the sound will come from the built-in speakers of the computer, but this is easily solved!  On your Mac, go to ‚ÄúSystem Settings‚Äù ---&gt; ‚ÄúSound‚Äù and in the ‚ÄúExit‚Äù tab choose ‚ÄúPartyFON MAX‚Äù: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6c6/4b4/849/6c64b484928e4b1c9d06d9e6ad43d7b9.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to the Mac, the vibro speaker can be connected to an iPhone, iPod, any smartphone with Bluetooth!  By the way, there is also the NFC logo on the column, but since I haven‚Äôt found anything at home with the support of this function, I could not try it ... <br><br>  Actually, this tune ends and you can safely begin to experiment with various surfaces at home or in the country! <br><br>  <b>How PartyFON MAX Column Sounds</b> <br><br>  The column is on, charged, connected to a Mac, which means you can safely put it on the table and start experimenting!  The first thing I tried was to put the column on the simplest Ikeev table. <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/159171605&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgs3y1kFkMFM-I7FpLMuu2_x8n_3A" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="The sound of vibrating speakers PartyFon on the table IKEA" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  As a result of the test column, it turned out that even the trash on the table does not distort the sound.  Much more important to catch the balance of volume, so that the speaker does not go into anguish! <br>  The next test bench I had was a kitchen table.  The sound was better, but not yet ideal ... <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/159171601&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhW1UG6I-Z0HLoc_rWAqdlaqkXYuw" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="The sound of vibrating speakers PartyFon on the kitchen table" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  And now the turn came to the best surface for vibrating columns. <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/159171606&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhbhBTyfD17vyeAxJ41shZhPmpFgA" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="The sound of vibrating columns PartyFon on the window" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The speaker‚Äôs sound is full, loud, and even the sound from the iMac will ‚Äúshout out‚Äù with ease.  But if you compare the sound quality with the desktop speakers, then everything is not so rosy ... The speaker volume is not the most important indicator, especially if you are a lover of high-quality sound!  The high frequencies ‚Äúwhistle‚Äù a little, while the powerful bass starts to fade, but this is only until the column is glued to the window glass!  I cannot say that the sound quality of this speaker is ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù, but I can well describe it as ‚Äúgood‚Äù.  For different styles and trends, you can choose the best surface, as well as play with the equalizer in iTunes to find the most optimal sound quality. <br><br>  Personally, at home I found the best option - this is a large window: the taped PartyFON MAX plays very decently! <br>  Do not forget that this column is positioned as a portable column, which is always with you, and therefore anywhere you can find a surface for mounting the column.  Of course, being in a noisy cafe, a party with friends at home or outdoors, you will not be interested in Hi-Fi sound quality, the main thing is that your favorite music would play in the background and it would play loud enough.  And the PartyFON MAX vibro-column copes with this task for all 100%! <br><br>  <b>Pros and cons of PartyFON MAX</b> <br><br>  As I said, from the pros I can highlight the following: <br>  ‚Ä¢ good workmanship of the column itself, when using a pleasant rough plastic; <br>  ‚Ä¢ good and loud sound, if you attach the speaker to a flat and, preferably, large surface; <br>  ‚Ä¢ light weight (about 270 grams) and small dimensions (55x70 mm), so that the column can easily fit into any bag or even a pocket of a winter jacket; <br>  ‚Ä¢ long speaker life: from 1.5 to 3-4 hours depending on the volume. <br><br>  Alas, but there are also disadvantages to this column: <br>  ‚Ä¢ plastic though pleasant to the touch, but very easily soiled and there are fingerprints on it; <br>  ‚Ä¢ based on the previous point, I would like to have a bag for transportation included. <br><br>  Personally, I really liked the vibro-column PartyFON MAX, and for a few days I lived in it, glued to the window!  Through it, I listened to music and listened to videos from YouTube (some videos were with a too weak sound and the vibrator was not weak enough to enhance it).  I also showed the column to my friends at a party and they also liked it very much: friends vividly clutched at it and began to attach it to various surfaces in search of the perfect sound.  :) <br>  I am sure that many people will like such a column and it will become an indispensable companion at various gatherings, with attacks on nature and just a homemade MEGA column! <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/159116056&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhz4vJqQr6gK1Vwk2utqf8Q7x534Q" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="PartyFon Max Review from AppleProfi.ru" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  I would also like to thank the company Dadzhet for the provided <a href="http://dadget.ru/katalog/multimedia/vibrodynamik/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_term%3Dvibrodynamik%26utm_content%3Dvibrodynamik%26utm_campaign%3Dvibrodynamik_156">vibrocolumn PartyFON MAX</a> . <br><br>  <a href="http://www.appleprofi.ru/">Kayumov Rifat</a> , Yekaterinburg </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/391997/">https://habr.com/ru/post/391997/</a></p>
