However, not everyone knows that once having specified the name of their organization, the company-developer cannot independently change it in iTunes.  From the word ‚Äúin general‚Äù.  How did we manage to solve the problem? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For us, this was critical, because at that time we were running the latest version of the Smarty CRM service.  The option ‚ÄúOblachnye Tekhnologii OOO‚Äù in the international market did not suit (the application is used in 176 countries).  Therefore, for the sake of the brand, we decided to go far. <br><br>  The difficulty is added by the fact that when a company name is given for the first time, no documents are required for this.  But if you need to update the name, you need patience terabytes, an English-speaking employee and a lot of documents confirming that you are you. <br><br>  The name change took a month and a half.  How did we go this way?

      To start, they sent a letter to itunesconnect@apple.com, as well as <a href="https://itunesconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa/wa/jumpTo%3Fpage%3DcontactUs">through the form on the website</a> , where they clearly stated the request: rename ‚ÄúOblachnye Tekhnologii OOO‚Äù to ‚ÄúClouds Technologies LLC‚Äù, as this corresponds to legally valid company documents.  In addition, the new version sounds better. <br><br>  The same day, the answer came.  The request was accepted for consideration by reporting the case number (case number).  It is better to write it down, as it simplifies communication in the future.  And it is better to always have access to the iTunes-account, from there often request information in such cases. <br><br>  Then we called Apple support for developers and reported the case number.  The list of phones is <a href="https://developer.apple.com/contact/phone/">here</a> .  Please note that you will not be consulted in Russian, communicate in a foreign language.  We talked with several offices, but stopped in German. <br><br>  He was chosen because we and they could communicate in both German and English.  It was a great relief, as managers from other offices speak with a lot of emphasis.  In total, 5-6 Apple managers spoke to us, who replaced each other.  At the final stage, there was only one. <br><br>  After several sessions, it turned out that they were expecting from us: <br><br>  - extract from Incorporation (original and translation); <br>  - a request from our employee, who acts as a Team Agent iTunes-account <br>  - answers to 9 questions. <br><br>  The questions are as follows: <br><br><blockquote>  <b>1)</b> The previous name of your company: Oblachnye Tekhnologii OOO <br>  - Previous name of your company: Oblachnye Tekhnologii OOO <br><br>  <b>2)</b> Your company: Clouds Technologies LLC <br>  - Your new company name: Clouds Technologies LLC <br><br>  <b>3)</b> Does the app store have any apps? <br>  - Do you have apps on the App Store that are already there or that are in the process of checking? <br><br>  <b>4)</b> Has the new company bought the original company? <br>  - Has the new company bought or acquired only the applications of the original company? <br><br>  <b>5)</b> Has the original company been dissolved in? <br>  - Was the original company liquidated or is it still in business? <br><br>  <b>6)</b> Has a whole business been made? <br>  - Has the new company bought or acquired the original company entirely? <br><br>  <b>7) The</b> legal entity has changed, or has the legal entity also changed? <br>  - Did the original company change only the name or did it also change its legal status (form of ownership)? <br><br>  <b>8)</b> Has the company undergone an address change?  If so, please provide your new address <br>  - Has the company changed the address?  If yes, please provide a new one. <br><br>  <b>9)</b> Does your company have a tax registration number?  If so, please provide your new address <br>  - Has your company got a new tax registration number (TIN)?  If yes, provide a new one. </blockquote><br>  Support also offered to create a new account and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/iTunesConnect_Guide_ru/Chapters/TransferringAndDeletingApps.html">make a transfer</a> .  But there is a requirement that "the application should not have current (or completed) offers of subscriptions to built-in purchases: automatically renewable, free or non-renewable." <br><br>  We have 3 business tariffs inside and subscribers to them, what to do with them then?  Therefore, rejected this option. <br><br>  We sent everything we needed, after which we were simply refused.  Rationale: Clouds Technologies LLC is a translation from Russian of the name of our company (Cloud Technologies LLC).  The argument seemed strange to us, since there is nothing illegal in the correct translation of the company name. <br><br>  Moreover, we were asked for court documents that would confirm that ‚ÄúLLC‚Äù is ‚ÄúLLC‚Äù, which surprised us even more. <br><br>  What we have brought counter-arguments? <br><br><blockquote>  - Transliteration of the name can not be left.  It is the same as calling William Shakespear William Shakespeare (William Shakespeare). <br>  - In all official documents there are both ‚ÄúLLC Cloud Technologies‚Äù and ‚ÄúClouds Technologies LLC‚Äù (the charter, the register, bank details). <br>  - For other companies on iTunes, the actual form of ownership does not coincide with that indicated in iTunes (CJSC instead of LLC).  Gave examples.  We have the same. <br>  - The form of ownership of ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù is also ‚ÄúLLC‚Äù and is translated as ‚ÄúLLC‚Äù.  Provided a link. <br>  - Why should we go to court: so that the judge confirms that ‚ÄúLLC‚Äù is ‚ÄúLLC‚Äù?  Do they understand that this is absurd? </blockquote><br>  We also requested the legal basis on which we were denied renaming.  This was necessary to ensure the validity of the position of Apple.  If the position was legally unjustified, we were ready to file a lawsuit, which was said directly. <br><br>  An 8-day silence followed, and the answer came on June 22.  It was reported that an exception was made for us and the name ‚ÄúOblachnye Tekhnologii OOO‚Äù was changed to ‚ÄúClouds Technologies LLC‚Äù.  No additional documents were required, we breathed a sigh of relief. <br><br>  Did you have similar problems with iTunes or with other markets, how did you deal with them? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/308790/">https://habr.com/ru/post/308790/</a></p>
