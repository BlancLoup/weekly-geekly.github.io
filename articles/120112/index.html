There Tasty - <a href="http://tamvkusno.ru/">guide to cafes and restaurants of Volgograd and Volzhsky</a> .  (Volzhsky, who does not know, the satellite city of Volgograd).  We visit restaurants and appreciate them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c7f/9a3/5a5/c7f9a35a5ff39a8293e85a8c26938234.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The overwhelming majority of sites about restaurants (both Volgograd and Moscow) work on two principles: <br>  1. A tasty description of the institution, attractive photos - everything is beautiful.  The restaurant pays money for this information.  You come and in fact everything turns out to be not as cool as in the picture. <br>  2. Description of the institution (short or detailed) + feedback from visitors.  There are such tricks of opinion that you are amazed.  One writes that he was almost sick after dinner, the other that this is the best restaurant he has ever visited.  Self-praise and plum rivals thrive. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  There are still large restaurant portals, where many visitors leave opinions and they also form a rating, but even there they wind up.  There is a restaurant critic <a href="http://afisha.ru/">poster</a> , writing a couple of paragraphs after visiting a restaurant.  But Afisha does not walk in Volgograd establishments, and we don‚Äôt have a large restaurant project with a rating.

      Therefore, <a href="http://magwai.ru/">our studio</a> decided to make a small project about restaurants in Volgograd.  The site has grown out of notes in my personal blog.  The basis was the principle of independence.  Reviewers go to a restaurant, eat, watch, evaluate, and write an honest, honest review.  Restaurants do not pay us money for the review.  We deliberately left the web2.0, where the opinion is formed by the crowd, in the direction of expert opinion. <br>  Another feature of our reviews - a large number of photos.  The interior and all ordered dishes are photographed.  The restaurant is estimated by 4 parameters: <br>  kitchen (the most important parameter); <br>  service; <br>  interior; <br>  atmosphere. <br><br>  The site was done quickly - on the framework of fuel, design template. <br><br><h5>  Difficulties </h5><br>  The texts are not written by journalists, so they are not always smooth.  We have 4 reviewers now.  The author must understand food and service, be able to take a snapshot of acceptable quality and correctly express their thoughts. <br>  Not all establishments are allowed to take pictures.  Idiotic, in my opinion, the requirement.  And the more (better) the camera, the more noticeable it is.  You have to take a photo secretly, sometimes even on the phone. <br>  The influence of the human factor - one waiter serves poorly, the next day the other - good.  But, I think this: if you have 20 waiters and one of them is bad, then it‚Äôs still a problem of the establishment that they couldn‚Äôt teach everyone.  And, it means that we were unlucky that we stumbled on this and the service charge was lowered. <br>  The cost of visiting restaurants.  The project is not commercial yet, most of the money we spend is on visiting institutions.  With monetization is still foggy.  We definitely will not write custom reviews (although we have already offered).  Placing banners on tamvkusno.ru restaurants, which we scolded, also will not). <br><br><h5>  Plans </h5><br>  Plans to add the ability to write reviews to visitors.  The peer reviews will remain the same, but visitors' reviews will not be superfluous. <br>  In distant plans to post reviews not only about cafes and restaurants, but also clubs, massage parlors, dance schools, etc. <br><br>  How do you like the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe project?  And how do you see its monetization (something more interesting than contextual and banner advertising is too obvious a suggestion)? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/120112/">https://habr.com/ru/post/120112/</a></p>
