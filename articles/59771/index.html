      Today, IT and English are inextricably linked.  In most cases, all good literature is published or posted online in the English language.  This language is the de facto standard not only in the IT world, but also in many other industries.  And there are countries where the majority of the population living own this means of communication. <br><br>  Unfortunately, Russia is not included in this number.  For many years, as in the secondary schools of our great country, English has been taught as a foreign language.  But how is it taught?  Someone is lucky, after school he can write and read in English.  Personally, I know only one person who is so lucky.  The rest after school were ‚Äúneither be nor me‚Äù, including me. <br><br>  At the university, the situation is not very even.  Terrible incomprehensible times: present perfects, pasties simply, perfect continents and so on. All this caused an explosion of the brain with the argument ‚Äúit is not clear when and how to use all this‚Äù. <br>  Fortunately, I once came across this book on the mighty Internet.  I thought that the next zamanilovka.  But how wrong I was.  By the way, this is the only book that I advised anyone who was interested in English. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So, what you will <b>not</b> find in this book: <br><ul><li>  English alphabet; </li><li>  drawing of the larynx and tongue; </li><li>  phonetic rules (reading letters, words); </li><li>  stories about that.  how great and powerful English is, and that everyone just needs to know it; </li><li>  schedules, monstrous plates; </li><li>  punctuation rules. </li></ul><br><br>  What you <b>will find</b> in this book: <br><ul><li>  formation of sentences (affirmative, interrogative); </li><li>  reconciliation of tenses; </li><li>  rules for the use of various forms of sentences (for example, Past Simple vs Present Perfect vs Present Perfect Continues); </li><li>  coordination of component parts in conditional sentences (three if); </li><li>  small tips on memorizing words, choosing teachers; </li><li>  consideration of the use of revolutions there is / there are, and other trifles (some, any, no, every). </li></ul><br><br>  As can be seen from the sample content above, this book is designed for beginners who are at a level slightly above zero. <br>  The book is written in clear, simple Russian. <br><br>  The main <b>disadvantages of the</b> book: <br><ul><li>  "Decrepit" binding.  Will break at the third disclosure of the book completely (soft cover); </li><li>  Not so much management as we would like.  True, the book has a slightly different goal - just to explain how to build sentences and use the times correctly, and if you want to train in another book; </li><li>  many quotes from old songs (The Beatles).  Personally, I am not "hot", but I have heard reviews from people who said that they did not like the Beatles, and using the lyrics of their songs somehow smears the effectiveness of the book. </li></ul><br><br>  And the biggest drawback of the book is that it is limited to only <u>two</u> volumes.  Unfortunately, the third volume has not been released for reasons unknown to me.  I even tried to find the author's soap, or the real address, in order to unsubscribe him (Gina).  So it did not work out.  In the third part, I most expected to see a clear explanation of the rules for the use of the gerrund.  And although now I have learned this peculiarity of the English language from other sources, I would still buy the third volume.  Just for the sake of giving friends to read, which language is not so easy. <br><br>  In general, I will say that the book is really good.  I recommended it to many people and have never received a negative response.  Read, learn English. <br><br>  Finally I will quote an annotation from <a href="http://ozon.ru/">ozon.ru</a> : <br><br>  <b>"</b> <i>We are accustomed to the idea that learning a foreign language is difficult, almost impossible. For this we need mountains of textbooks, a lot of time, a special natural gift and God knows what else. But now it's time to destroy this cruel myth. The author of this book received a higher philological education in the USA, but remained Russian by nationality, it uses a fundamentally new approach to learning, skillfully combining the depth of presentation of theoretical material with the ease of practical training.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The book is designed for a basic level of language proficiency.</i>  <b>"</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/59771/">https://habr.com/ru/post/59771/</a></p>
