  <section class="page js-page"><h1>ESET: new delivery schemes for OceanLotus cyber group backdoor</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the post, we will describe how the OceanLotus cyber group (APT32 and APT-C-00) recently used one of the publicly available exploits for <a href="https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2017-11882">CVE-2017-11882</a> , the memory corruption vulnerability in Microsoft Office, and how malware of the group ensures persistence in compromised systems without leaving any traces. .  Then we describe how, since the beginning of 2019, the group used self-extracting archives to run the code. <br><br>  OceanLotus specializes in cyber espionage, priority objectives - the countries of Southeast Asia.  The attackers forge documents that attract the attention of potential victims to convince those who perform the backdoor, and also work on the development of the toolkit.  The methods used to create baits vary in different attacks - from files with a "double extension", self-extracting archives, documents with macros to known exploits. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ap/h9/mc/aph9mchsgkupnlpka6cf7g_u13g.jpeg"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><h2>  Using the exploit in Microsoft Equation Editor </h2><br>  In mid-2018, OceanLotus campaigned using the CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability.  One of the malicious cyber-group documents was analyzed by the experts of the 360 ‚Äã‚ÄãThreat Intelligence Center ( <a href="https://ti.360.net/blog/articles/oceanlotus-targets-chinese-university/">research in Chinese</a> ), including a detailed description of the exploit.  In the post below - an overview of such a malicious document.

    <h3>  First stage </h3><br>  The <code>FW Report on demonstration of former CNRP in Republic of Korea.doc</code> (SHA-1: <code>D1357B284C951470066AAA7A8228190B88A5C7C3</code> ) is similar to the one mentioned in the study above.  It is interesting because it targets users interested in Cambodian politics (CNRP - National Salvation Party of Cambodia, dissolved at the end of 2017).  Despite the .doc extension, the document is in RTF format (see figure below), contains a garbage code, and is also distorted. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/a-/gt/6y/a-gt6ylnd0rbyzvs8eecjpi04-a.png"><br>  <i>Figure 1. "Garbage" in RTF</i> <br><br>  Despite the presence of distorted elements, Word successfully opens this RTF file.  As can be seen in Figure 2, here is the EQNOLEFILEHDR structure with an offset of 0xC00, followed by the MTEF header, and then the MTEF entry (Figure 3) for the font. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oh/ks/tb/ohkstbugzx97wthqqqnrdoo27di.png"><br>  <i>Figure 2. FONT record values</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jy/wj/b5/jywjb5bgsixdqywivkc_ndzcgiu.png"><br>  <i>Figure 3. <a href="http://rtf2latex2e.sourceforge.net/MTEF3.html">FONT recording format</a></i> <br><br>  An overflow in the <i>name</i> field is possible because its size is not checked before copying.  A name that is too long triggers a vulnerability.  As can be seen from the contents of the RTF file (offset 0xC26 in Figure 2), the buffer is filled with a shell code, followed by a dummy command ( <code>0x90</code> ) and the return address <code>0x402114</code> .  The address is a dialog element in <code>EQNEDT32.exe</code> , pointing to the <code>RET</code> instruction.  This causes the EIP to point to the beginning of the <i>name</i> field containing the shellcode. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_9/gf/lo/_9gflo6k9zsefvvnq8jdaqosuua.png"><br>  <i>Figure 4. Beginning of shellcode exploit</i> <br><br>  The address <code>0x45BD3C</code> stores a variable that is dereferenced until it reaches a pointer to the current loaded <code>MTEFData</code> structure.  Here is the rest of the shellcode. <br><br>  The purpose of the shellcode is to execute the second fragment of the shellcode embedded in an open document.  First, the source shellcode tries to find the file descriptor of an open document by <code>NtQuerySystemInformation</code> over all system descriptors ( <code>NtQuerySystemInformation</code> with <code>NtQuerySystemInformation</code> argument) and checking if the <i>PID of the</i> descriptor and the <code>WinWord</code> process <code>WinWord</code> and if the document was opened with an access mask ‚Äî <code>0x12019F</code> . <br><br>  To confirm the discovery of the correct descriptor (and not the descriptor of another open document), the contents of the file are displayed using the <code>CreateFileMapping</code> function, and the shellcode checks whether the last four bytes of the document correspond to " <code>yyyy</code> " (Egg Hunting method).  As soon as a match is found, the document is copied to the temporary folder ( <code>GetTempPath</code> ) as <code>ole.dll</code> .  Then read the last 12 bytes of the document. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/w3/lq/xv/w3lqxvqbmerfijoryxi3vkitaao.png"><br>  <i>Figure 5. End-of-document markers</i> <br><br>  The 32-bit value between the <code>AABBCCDD</code> and <code>yyyy</code> markers is the offset of the next shell code.  It is called using the <code>CreateThread</code> function.  The same shellcode that was used by the OceanLotus group earlier was extracted.  <a href="https://github.com/eset/malware-research/tree/master/oceanlotus/shellcode_emulator">The Python emulation script</a> , which we released in March 2018, is still working for the second stage dump. <br><br><h3>  Second phase </h3><br><h4>  Extraction of components </h4><br>  File and directory names are dynamically selected.  The code randomly selects the name of the executable or DLL file in <code>C:\Windows\system32</code> .  It then queries its resources and retrieves the <code>FileDescription</code> field for use as the folder name.  If this does not work, the code randomly selects the folder name from the <code>%ProgramFiles%</code> or <code>C:\Windows</code> directories (from GetWindowsDirectoryW).  It avoids using a name that might conflict with existing files, and makes sure that it does not contain the following words: <code>windows</code> , <code>Microsoft</code> , <code>desktop</code> , <code>system</code> , <code>system32</code> or <code>syswow64</code> .  If the directory already exists, "NLS_ {6 characters}" is added to the name. <br><br>  Resource <code>0x102</code> analyzed and files are reset to <code>%ProgramFiles%</code> or <code>%AppData%</code> , to a folder selected at random.  The creation time is changed to have the same values ‚Äã‚Äãas <code>kernel32.dll</code> . <br><br>  For example, here is the folder and list of files created by selecting the executable file <code>C:\Windows\system32\TCPSVCS.exe</code> as the data source. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/px/ls/xq/pxlsxqrz8s0beuxfybxu0cvz8dg.png"><br>  <i>Figure 6. Removing various components</i> <br><br>  The structure of the resource <code>0x102</code> in the dropper is quite complicated.  In a nutshell, it contains: <br>  - Filenames <br>  - File size and content <br>  - Compression format ( <code>COMPRESSION_FORMAT_LZNT1</code> , used by the <code>RtlDecompressBuffer</code> function) <br><br>  The first file is reset as <code>TCPSVCS.exe</code> , which is the legitimate <code>AcroTranscoder.exe</code> (according to <code>FileDescription</code> , SHA-1: <code>2896738693A8F36CC7AD83EF1FA46F82F32BE5A3</code> ). <br><br>  You may have noticed that the size of some DLL files exceeds 11 MB.  This is due to the fact that a large continuous buffer of random data is located inside the executable file.  It is possible that this is a way to avoid detection by some products for security. <br><br><h4>  Ensuring Persistence </h4><br>  The resource <code>0x101</code> in the dropper contains two 32-bit integers that determine how to ensure persistence.  The value of the first indicates how the malware will persist without administrator rights. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/f6/aw/1x/f6aw1xtjqv-tfril3uzrx_nzstw.png"><br>  <i>Table 1. The mechanism of persistence without administrative rights</i> <br><br>  The value of the second integer indicates how the malware should ensure persistence, working with administrator rights. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/db/p2/em/dbp2embzyazeoxdnk8h6uji9lm4.png"><br>  <i>Table 2. Admin Persistence Mechanism</i> <br><br>  The service name is the file name without the extension;  The display name is the folder name, but if it already exists, the line ‚Äú <code>Revision 1</code> ‚Äù is added to it (the number increases until an unused name is found).  Operators made sure that the persistence through the service was stable - in case of failure, the service should be restarted after 1 second.  Then, the <code>WOW64</code> value of the new service registry key is assigned the value 4, which indicates that it is a 32-bit service. <br><br>  The scheduled task is created through several COM interfaces: <code>ITaskScheduler</code> , <code>ITask</code> , <code>ITaskTrigger</code> , <code>IPersistFile</code> and <code>ITaskScheduler</code> .  In essence, the malware creates a hidden task, sets the account information along with information about the current user or administrator, and then sets the trigger. <br><br>  This is a daily task with a duration of 24 hours and intervals between two executions of 10 minutes, which means that it will be performed continuously. <br><br><h4>  Malicious bit </h4><br>  In our example, the executable <code>TCPSVCS.exe</code> ( <code>AcroTranscoder.exe</code> ) is legitimate software that loads DLLs that are dropped with it.  In this case, of interest is <code>Flash Video Extension.dll</code> . <br><br>  Its <code>DLLMain</code> function simply calls another function.  Some fuzzy predicates are present: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/b-/im/fe/b-imfeegcv30g23fj2n9qqowdeu.png"><br>  <i>Figure 7. Fuzzy predicates</i> <br><br>  After these misleading checks, the code gets the <code>.text</code> section of the <code>TCPSVCS.exe</code> file, changes its protection to <code>PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE</code> and overwrites it by adding dummy instructions: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dp/e7/fn/dpe7fnpq2lrioo0i15ki742mhro.png"><br>  <i>Figure 8. Sequence instructions</i> <br><br>  At the end, the <code>CALL</code> instruction is added to the address of the <code>FLVCore::Uninitialize(void)</code> function exported by <code>Flash Video Extension.dll</code> .  This means that after loading a malicious DLL, when the runtime calls <code>WinMain</code> in <code>TCPSVCS.exe</code> , the instruction pointer will point to NOP, causing <code>FLVCore::Uninitialize(void)</code> as a result, the next step. <br><br>  The function simply creates a mutex starting with <code>{181C8480-A975-411C-AB0A-630DB8B0A221}</code> , followed by the current username.  It then reads the dumped file with the * .db3 extension, which contains position-independent code, and uses <code>CreateThread</code> to execute the content. <br><br>  The contents of the * .db3 file is the shell code that the OceanLotus group usually uses.  We successfully unpacked its payload again using the emulator script we published <a href="https://github.com/eset/malware-research/tree/master/oceanlotus/shellcode_emulator">on GitHub</a> . <br><br>  The script retrieves the final stage.  This component is a backdoor, which we have already analyzed in a <a href="https://habr.com/post/421779/">previous OceanLotus study</a> .  This can be identified by the GUID <code>{A96B020F-0000-466F-A96D-A91BBF8EAC96}</code> binary file.  The configuration of the malware is still encrypted in the RE resource.  It has approximately the same configuration, but C &amp; C servers are different from the previous ones: <br><br> <code>- andreagahuvrauvin[.]com <br> - byronorenstein[.]com <br> - stienollmache[.]xyz</code> <br> <br>  The OceanLotus group again demonstrates a combination of different techniques to avoid detection.  They returned with a "modified" scheme of the infection process.  Choosing random names and filling executable files with random data, they reduce the number of reliable IoCs (based on hashes and file names).  Moreover, due to the use of a third-party DLL loading, the attackers only need to remove the <code>AcroTranscoder</code> legitimate binary. <br><br><h2>  Self-extracting archives </h2><br>  After the RTF files, the group switched to self-extracting (SFX) archives with common document icons to confuse the user.  This was written Threatbook ( <a href="https://x.threatbook.cn/nodev4/vb4/article%3FthreatInfoID%3D785">link in Chinese</a> ).  After launch, self-extracting RAR files are reset and DLLs with the .ocx extension are executed, the final payload of which was previously documented <code>{A96B020F-0000-466F-A96D-A91BBF8EAC96}.dll</code> .  Since mid-January 2019, OceanLotus has reused this technique, but over time changes some configurations.  In this section, we will talk about technology and changes. <br><br><h4>  Making bait </h4><br>  Document <code>THICH-THONG-LAC-HANH-THAP-THIEN-VIET-NAM (1).EXE</code> (SHA-1: <code>AC10F5B1D5ECAB22B7B418D6E98FA18E32BBDEAB</code> ) was first found in 2018.  This SFX file was created wisely - in the description ( <i>Version Info</i> ) it is said that this is a JPEG image.  The SFX script looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/i7/tg/nz/i7tgnzif_wi8kcy7g3liki3la4e.png"><br>  <i>Figure 9. SFX Commands</i> <br><br>  The malware resets <code>{9ec60ada-a200-4159-b310-8071892ed0c3}.ocx</code> (SHA-1: <code>EFAC23B0E6395B1178BCF7086F72344B24C04DCC</code> ), as well as a picture of the <code>2018 thich thong lac.jpg.</code> <br><br>  The bait image looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/x2/xh/sn/x2xhsnoscn9jdpm_phc4x5bms4q.jpeg"><br>  <i>Figure 10. Lure Image</i> <br><br>  You may have noticed that the first two lines in the SFX script call the OCX file twice, but this is not an error. <br><br><h4>  {9ec60ada-a200-4159-b310-8071892ed0c3} .ocx (ShLd.dll) </h4><br>  The OSH control file flow is very similar to other components of OceanLotus - many sequences of <code>JZ/JNZ</code> and <code>PUSH/RET</code> commands alternating with garbage code. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hs/1j/yd/hs1jydni8wxcqylyvtvimc7_ckm.png"><br>  <i>Figure 11. Obfuscated code</i> <br><br>  After filtering out the garbage code, the <code>DllRegisterServer</code> export, called <code>regsvr32.exe</code> , looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qh/r3/ws/qhr3ws_knbm_pewxrzsqhrpzggi.png"><br>  <i>Figure 12. Basic installer code</i> <br><br>  In fact, when you first call <code>DllRegisterServer</code> export sets the registry value <code>HKCU\SOFTWARE\Classes\CLSID\{E08A0F4B-1F65-4D4D-9A09-BD4625B9C5A1}\Model</code> for the encrypted offset to the DLL ( <code>0x10001DE0</code> ). <br><br>  When the function is called a second time, it reads the same value and runs to that address.  From here, a resource is read and executed and many actions in RAM are performed. <br><br>  The shellcode is the same PE bootloader used in past OceanLotus campaigns.  It can be emulated using <a href="https://github.com/eset/malware-research/tree/master/oceanlotus/shellcode_emulator">our script</a> .  As a result, it resets <code>db293b825dcc419ba7dc2c49fa2757ee.dll</code> , loads it into memory and executes <code>DllEntry</code> . <br><br>  The DLL extracts the contents of its resource, decrypts (AES-256-CBC) and unpacks (LZMA) it.  The resource has a specific format that is easy to decompile. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ge/l4/ss/gel4ssv32blxwcjjlxkc57g0vie.png"><br>  <i>Figure 13. Installer configuration structure (KaitaiStruct Visualizer)</i> <br><br>  The configuration is specified explicitly - depending on the privilege level, the binary data will be written in <code>%appdata%\Intel\logs\BackgroundUploadTask.cpl</code> or <code>%windir%\System32\BackgroundUploadTask.cpl</code> (or <code>SysWOW64</code> for 64-bit systems). <br><br>  Next, persistence is ensured by creating a task called <code>BackgroundUploadTask[junk].job</code> , where <code>[junk]</code> is a set of bytes <code>0x9D</code> and <code>0xA0</code> . <br><br>  The application name of the task is <code>%windir%\System32\control.exe</code> , and the parameter value is the path to the downloaded binary file.  Hidden task runs every day. <br><br>  Constructively, the CPL file is a DLL with the internal name <code>ac8e06de0a6c4483af9837d96504127e.dll</code> , which exports the <code>CPlApplet</code> function.  This file decrypts its only resource <code>{A96B020F-0000-466F-A96D-A91BBF8EAC96}.dll</code> , then loads this DLL and causes it to be the only <code>DllEntry</code> export. <br><br><h4>  Backdoor configuration file </h4><br>  The backdoor configuration is encrypted and embedded in its resources.  The structure of the configuration file is very similar to the previous one. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/as/2f/c8/as2fc8ivbc6_bku2pjs5h-6_qtw.png"><br>  <i>Figure 14. Backdoor configuration structure (KaitaiStruct Visualizer)</i> <br><br>  Despite the similar structure, the values ‚Äã‚Äãof many fields have been updated compared to the data in <a href="https://habr.com/post/421779/">our old report</a> . <br><br>  The first element of the binary array contains a DLL ( <code>HttpProv.dll</code> MD5: <code>2559738D1BD4A999126F900C7357B759</code> ) <a href="https://s.tencent.com/research/report/471.html">identified by Tencent</a> .  But since the export name was removed from the binary file, the hashes do not match. <br><br><h3>  Additional research </h3><br>  Collecting samples, we paid attention to some characteristics.  The sample just described appeared around July 2018, and others like it most recently, in mid-January - early February 2019.  As an infection vector, an SFX archive was used, dumping a legitimate bait document and a malicious OCX file. <br><br>  Although OceanLotus uses fake timestamps, we noticed that the timestamps of the SFX and OCX files are always the same ( <code>0x57B0C36A</code> (08/14/2016 @ 7:15 pm UTC) and <code>0x498BE80F</code> (02/06/2009 @ 7:34 am UTC ) respectively).  This probably indicates that the authors have a certain ‚Äúconstructor‚Äù that uses the same templates and simply changes some characteristics. <br><br>  Among the documents that we have studied since the beginning of 2018, there are various names that indicate the countries of interest to the attacking countries: <br><br>  <i>- The New Contact Information Of Cambodia Media (New) .xls.exe</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- ÊùéÂª∫ È¶ô (‰∏™‰∫∫ ÁÆÄÂéÜ) .exe (fake pdf document of a CV)</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- feedback, Rally in USA from July 28-29, 2018.exe</i> <br><br>  Since the discovery of the backdoor <code>{A96B020F-0000-466F-A96D-A91BBF8EAC96}.dll</code> and the publication of its analysis by several researchers, we have seen some changes in the malware configuration data. <br><br>  First, the authors began to remove names from supporting DLLs ( <code>DNSprov.dll</code> and two versions of <code>HttpProv.dll</code> ).  Then the operators stopped packing the third DLL (the second version of <code>HttpProv.dll</code> ), choosing to embed only one. <br><br>  Secondly, many of the backdoor configuration fields were changed, probably to avoid detection, as many IoCs became available.  Among the important fields modified by the authors are the following: <br><br><ul><li>  Changed the AppX registry key (see IoCs) </li><li>  mutex encoding string ("def", "abc", "ghi") </li><li>  port number </li></ul><br>  Finally, in all the new versions analyzed, new C &amp; Cs appeared, listed in the IoCs section. <br><br><h2>  findings </h2><br>  OceanLotus continues to evolve.  The cyber group focuses on the refinement and expansion of tools and baits.  The authors mask malicious payloads with attention-grabbing documents, the topic of which is relevant to the alleged victims.  They develop new schemes, and also use publicly available tools, for example, the Equation Editor exploit.  Moreover, they are improving tools to reduce the number of artifacts remaining on the victims' machines, thereby reducing the chance of antivirus software being detected. <br><br><h2>  Compromise indicators </h2><br>  Indicators of compromise, as well as the attributes of MITER ATT &amp; CK are available <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/03/20/fake-or-fake-keeping-up-with-oceanlotus-decoys/">on Welivesecurity</a> and <a href="https://github.com/eset/malware-ioc/tree/master/oceanlotus">on GitHub</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/446604/">https://habr.com/ru/post/446604/</a></p>
