But you have to hit a couple of times ...</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/790/22d/fba/79022dfba3ca4db1a28081356459d15d.jpg"><br>  Open online store is not easy, but very simple.  On this topic on the Megamind will be a guaranteed crowd of more specialists than me, at least about Ecwid talk, at least about Vukommers, at least about Inseil.  A separate story about the fact that when you try to pull this case out of nanobusiness, at least in a microbusiness, a carriage and a small cart of unrecorded moments begin, not less separate - ambushes with no clear delivery, I don‚Äôt remember about the fullfillment at all. <br><br><blockquote>  My task for today is to talk about the whole car of legal issues that exist around you in the presence of an electronic store, regardless of your desires.  These moments are called Consumer Rights, and the truth of life is that these rights are not fully implemented almost anywhere and by no one.  Actually, we do not have professional salesmen coming to our market solely because the sums are generally of little interest to fight for them.  Which categorically does not mean that it will always be like this, crisis-shmises, everything. </blockquote><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The trick is that with good business, to comply is not so difficult.  Simply, we all score, and sometimes just do not know.  Let's go through the list to see what is unfinished? <br><br><h4>  What rights does a consumer have when buying from an online store, which means that you are obliged to provide him? <br></h4><br><h5>  The right to inform prior to the conclusion of the contract of sale. </h5><br>  The right to information includes the opportunity for consumers to familiarize themselves with the information on the website of the online store: <ul><li>  about the seller (full company name and location); </li><li>  about the product (its main consumer properties, place of manufacture, price) and about the conditions for purchasing the goods, their delivery, service life, shelf life and warranty period, and the procedure for payment for the goods; </li><li>  about the period during which the proposal to conclude a contract is valid (for example, the exact timing of actions or sales, when a different price for the product is valid). </li></ul>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

      <br>
      This is including if you trade in any kind of handmade, etc. <br><br>  The buyer has the right to demand compensation from the seller for damages caused by the unreasonable evasion of the store from the conclusion of the contract.  The loss here, of course, is a pretty crooked thing, but, nevertheless, it‚Äôs pretty easy to fly into a complaint because you forgot to write some simple words. <br><br><h5>  The right to proper execution of the contract. </h5><br><br>  Just clicked and bought - this, of course, is nice, but according to the law, the buyer has the right to complete the design.  Let's say that this procedure: <br><ul><li>  The store places a description of the product on the site, and if it contains all the essential terms of the contract (product properties, price), then such a proposal is called a public offer.  This means that the online store MUST conclude an agreement with any person who has expressed the intention to purchase the goods offered in his description. </li><li>  The buyer, if he agrees to purchase items at the price indicated in the catalog, sends a message to the store about the intention to purchase the goods.  For example, it fills in a special form on the site or certain input fields on the checkout page.  It all depends on the rules of checkout valid in this store.  Which, BINGO !, MUST be on the site and the user should be able to read them. </li></ul><br><br>  After the buyer has agreed to conclude a contract, the store can no longer change at its own discretion the characteristics of the goods, the price, the rules of delivery or the TERM.  Here begins the hysterical laughter of people who worked with any deliveryman from either side of the procedure.  If the rules are changed, the buyer has the right to insist on the transfer of the goods to him under the conditions previously agreed.  Or he can withdraw from the contract and demand compensation for damages caused to him.  From the store, ord.  How you arrange delivery doesn't bother him. <br><br><h5>  The right to provide the buyer with documents related to the purchase <br></h5><br>  If the goods are paid in cash, the store must issue a check.  If payment occurs in a non-cash manner, then the store must, along with the transfer of goods, issue a written invoice or act to the buyer.  In addition, the store must issue to the product all instructions and accessories relying on it.  It more or less all do, ok. <br><br><h5>  Delivery right <br></h5><br>  The online store is obliged to offer the buyer services for the delivery of goods.  Well, this is also not a problem. <br><br><h5>  The right to inform at the time of execution of the contract <br></h5><br>  But it happens well, sooooo little who.  And it is quite a significant.  Even if the website of the online store contains all the necessary information about the seller and the product, the law requires that at the time of delivery of the goods the seller once again provides this information to the buyer - in writing.  Moreover, for imported goods such information should be in Russian. <br><br><h5>  And finally: the right to return the goods <br></h5><br>  The buyer can return the goods to the online store: <br><ul><li>  before the transfer of goods - at any time;  in a sense, refuse the transaction until the goods are handed over. </li><li>  within 7 days after the transfer;  for example, go to the party dress and return it.  Yeah. </li><li>  within 3 months after the transfer - in the event that the store, when handing over the goods to the buyer, did not inform him in writing about the procedure and terms for returning the goods.  Well, now most are taught by bitter experience and inform right on the check. </li></ul><br><br>  Again, the reasons for the return can be any. <br><blockquote>  There are some reservations about the return of goods of good quality, that is, when everything is OK with the goods, the buyer simply changed his mind.  It is impossible to return hygiene items and anything that was made personally for you - well, that is understandable, it is not at all clear what the product or service. <br></blockquote><br>  Here is a list.  Not too scary, but in a significant part overlooked for the vast majority of stores, alas. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297906/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297906/</a></p>
