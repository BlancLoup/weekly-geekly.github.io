If, for some reason, you were still skeptical about the capabilities of artificial intelligence, now, perhaps, you have a chance to change your attitude.  For the creation of beer, the taste of which is close to the "ideal" took already demonstrated their <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/ibm/blog/252474/">culinary talents</a> earlier AI IBM Watson.  Of course, taste is an individual concept, and, nevertheless, the attempts of a machine to approach a person in such a delicate matter as taste sensations deserve our attention. <br><br>  So, what is ‚ÄúPyaterochka‚Äù from IBM Watson and how the unique variety of the world's first high-tech festive beer was created, we will describe in our today's publication. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/317/d93/d6e/317d93d6ec5aadbb212acb20192d5072.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Immediately make a reservation that initially the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a beer using the capabilities of AI was associated with such a holiday as New Year, but the concepts fed to the car when developing a new variety with minor amendments in perspective could well be taken as a basis for drawing up unique recipes for drinks and dishes on any holiday table.

      Christmas beer, according to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe authors of the company <a href="http://havashelia.com/">Havas Helia</a> , is simply obliged to inspire optimism, traditionally associated with the "update" of our emotional firmware.  To achieve this goal, the author decided to use the information collected in social media, thus defining several thousand words used by the communities in their congratulations.  Having systematized the collected data, he assigned 24 emotional states to them.  After that 38 positive emotions associated with the celebration of a particular celebration were identified.  These included waiting, amazement, condescension, generosity, happiness, joy, love, high spirits, etc. <br><br>  At the next stage, the data collected and systematized in this way were transferred to the processing of artificial intelligence.  For this purpose, Alchemy technology capabilities were used, the copyright for which IBM bought from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlchemyAPI">AlchemyAPI</a> .  To obtain the result, IBM Watson, relying on the initial parameters, analyzed the data of tastings and reviews available on professional resources and in the media, went through a multitude of probable ingredients and 2,800 different beer recipes. <br><br>  The next step on the way to the goal was to compile on the basis of the machine analysis data of that ‚Äúone and only‚Äù recipe, which, according to the creators of the ‚Äú0101‚Äù beer (this is how they decided to name the new product), should have caused it to the tasters holiday emotions.  The decision of this responsible task was assigned to the <a href="http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/doc/personality-insights/">Watson Personality Insights service</a> , which allowed to classify beer according to certain qualities associated, according to ‚Äúhis opinion‚Äù, with ‚Äúassertiveness‚Äù, ‚Äúintellectuality‚Äù, ‚Äúfriendliness‚Äù, ‚Äúoptimism‚Äù, etc. As a result of processing At this stage, 10 recipes were proposed. <br><br>  Further analysis of the options obtained and the selection of 10 compositions of common components yielded the expected ‚Äúexcellent result‚Äù - ‚Äúhigh-tech‚Äù beer ‚Äú0101‚Äù, and translating from the language of binary logic into decimal - an impeccable ‚ÄúPyaterochka‚Äù. <br><br>  The complete recipe for the drink was quite complicated.  The proportions and ingredients included in its composition, the authors decided to keep secret, sharing only the fact that it includes two types of hops: Hallertauer - "catalyst of emotions" and Nelson Sauvin, aggravating the sensation of determination, optimism and vivacity of imagination in the taster.  It also became a part of honey, which should give a charge of cheerfulness and love to the tried Pyaterochka. <br><br>  A limited edition of 500 bottles was brewed at the small brewing company High Peak Brew.  It was not by accident that the choice was made: the beer produced at the plant‚Äôs facilities does not contain any artificial additives, and the technological process does not involve filtration.  These benefits made it possible to get exactly the taste gamut, which was as close as possible to the recommended IBM Watson. <br><br>  In a joke, the authors of the idea say that ‚Äú0101‚Äù beer is a challenger that marks the beginning of a whole epoch, time, where the concepts: ‚Äúfood in general‚Äù, ‚Äúfast food‚Äù and ‚Äúsnack on the go‚Äù will be absent by definition.  In their opinion, such an unproductive and even harmful pastime will be replaced by the era of gourmets who can appreciate the superiority of food and drinks that turn life into a holiday.  And help to achieve this goal, of course, artificial intelligence). <br><br>  <i><sub><a href="http://brewedbydata.com/">Source 1</a></sub></i> <br>  <i><sub><a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/0101-beer-havas-helia/">Source 2</a></sub></i> <br><br>  Let us be healthy and, of course, do not forget to congratulate our intellectual half, quarter, and seven o'clock on the Holiday!) <br><hr><br>  Dear readers, we are always happy to meet and wait for you on the pages of our blog.
