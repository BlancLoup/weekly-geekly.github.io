  <section class="page js-page"><h1>WorldSkills Russia professional skills competition</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In this article I want to talk about the <a href="http://worldskills.ru/">WorldSkills Russia</a> professional skill contest, which was held in Moscow on November 1-4 at the All-Russia Exhibition Center.  I participated in the Web Design competency.  The narration will be from the point of view of the participant. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a7e/b80/fc5/a7eb80fc5a1f4f8fdf61865b881ee2ec.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  About competition </h5><br>  WorldSkills is a competition whose goal is to identify professionals in a particular field.  The competition takes its origin from WorldSkills International (WSI), an international non-profit association. <br>  The open championship was held in Moscow for the second time.  Participation in the competition is free.  The age of participants is from 18 to 22 years old, students in colleges or universities.  14 competencies were presented in Moscow, more detailed information can be found on the <a href="http://moscow2013.worldskills.ru/docs/competences/">official website</a> . <br>  The contest lasts 4 days: in the morning opening, then the competition, on the final day - summing up and closing.  The main feature of the competition is that the competition takes place on the site, open to everyone. <br><br><h5>  About the competence of web design </h5><br>  This competency is connected not only with web design, but also with web development as a whole.  (I think this is due to the translation, from English the design also translates as development).  The competence was attended by 24 contestants from different regions of Russia.  To get into the top ten, you had to know: the basics of web design, HTML, CSS3, PHP, JavaScript, jQuery, working with Ajax. <br>  The competition task was divided into 3 modules, each of which is designed to be performed during the day and focuses on individual features and technologies of Web development.  All modules are not related.  For some of them, a set of source files is provided for performing tasks.  Details about the modules below.  For each day of the competition (they lasted 2.5 days) a new task was presented, some consisted of two parts - A and B. The first part, according to the conditions, should be completed before the lunch break, the second - before the end of the day.  After completion of the module, the work was evaluated by experts.  For each day a specific implementation plan was provided. <br>  The Internet was available on a dedicated computer with a time limit: each participant could use it no more than two times for 5 minutes per module (unused time burned).  It was forbidden to use telephones, notebooks and study aids.  There was little documented information in Russian, and extensive information was provided only in English. <br><br><h5>  About myself </h5><br>  To talk in detail about the competition, for a start I will tell you a little about myself.  I am a 4th year student at a Moscow college, studying in the field of Applied Informatics.  In the curriculum there is a discipline "Internet technology", in which the basics of HTML, CSS and PHP are taught.  Those basics that I had after the studied discipline, I would not have enough to break even in the top ten.  So, I got a deeper knowledge of this discipline by myself, studying web technologies through videos, guides and articles.

    <h5>  Now about the competition <br>  First day of competition </h5><br>  We (the participants) arrived at the site in the morning, were briefed on TB.  Between the contestants was held toss jobs for computers.  Next was the grand opening.  Then the fun began, that is, the competition itself.  On this day, it was necessary to implement the first module.  We were introduced to the evaluation criteria of the module: points were given for each criterion fulfilled.  In the first module it was necessary to do: <br><blockquote><ul><li>  ‚ÄúRedesign of the OCE website, at least 2 pages, for the main page, and for the page with functionality; </li><li>  Prepare an analysis of the old design, indicate its shortcomings and solutions in a new version; <br>  Prepare a site map and applicable color palette; </li><li>  Provide a 480px narrow screen mobile page design. ‚Äù </li></ul></blockquote><br>  The whole module was given 4 hours. <br>  I completed the module on all criteria, and I had time, but, unfortunately, there was no material for the second module, so for me the first stage was completed. <br><br><h5>  Second day of competition </h5><br>  It is logical to assume today it was necessary to implement the second module.  This module was divided into part ‚ÄúA‚Äù, which had to be done before the break, and part ‚ÄúB‚Äù.  Each part was given 4 hours. <br>  In part "A" it was necessary to implement: <br><ul><li>  Layout of 2 layouts: the main and functional pages; </li><li>  Slider on pure JavaScript, where at least 3 slides.  Estimated difficulty moving slides. </li></ul><br>  UPD: Layouts: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a2f/072/143/a2f0721433f3bd30946ed2108f0bcf4c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cac/52b/a82/cac52ba821e2c2876739609b82da63f4.jpg"><br><br>  Alas, here I managed to impose only 2 layouts. <br>  In part ‚ÄúB‚Äù the task was as follows: <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúUnfortunately, the previous developer has lost the style file, so you need to re-create the main page of the site-catalog of museums of the capital.  According to his latest entries, the site should be presented with a "slider", a table with visiting statistics and a menu with sections. " </blockquote>  From the source files was given HTML layout, empty style.css and script.js.  You could only edit style.css and implement a slide transition in script.js. <br>  Here I also coped with the whole module. <br><br><h5>  Third day of competition </h5><br>  This day was the most exhausting, both emotionally and physically.  In the third module there were 2 parts, but parts ‚ÄúA‚Äù and ‚ÄúB‚Äù could be performed simultaneously.  The execution of the entire module took 6 hours.  For the implementation of this module gave the most points. <br>  In the third module, the task sounded like this: <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúYou will be provided with HTML and CSS files and various images.  Your work will not be evaluated by design criteria, HTML and CSS.  Note that the layout contains redundant functionality.  You should leave only those functions that you are required to implement. <br>  Your task is to create a flexible Framework with a given functionality.  By lunchtime, you should create a common PHP framework and by the end of the day you should complete the rest of the client interface functions. <br>  Task description: <br><ul><li>  For site guests <br><ul><li>  View articles, comments and a list of attractions on the city map. </li><li>  Possibility to register (email confirmation is not required). </li></ul></li><li>  For registered users <br><ul><li>  The possibility of authorization using the login and password and the end of the session. </li><li>  Making a list (route) of your walk in Moscow, ‚Äúdragging‚Äù the sights from the map to the trip list and back to delete; </li><li>  Manual sorting of route points must be present; </li><li>  View selected points of interest on the map; </li><li>  Ability to post comments to the sights; </li><li>  To confirm their comments, the visitor is obliged to use the CAPTCHA mechanism. </li></ul></li><li>  For admin <br><ul><li>  The possibility of authorization using the login and password and the end of the session. </li><li>  The ability to add a point of interest by dragging a marker from the add form to the map and delete by dragging the marker from the map to the basket. </li></ul></li></ul><br>  Be sure to use the capabilities of open libraries.  Technologies like Flash, Silverlight, or pure JavaScript will not be evaluated. ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  Here I implemented: <br><ul><li>  as the organizers of the competition say, the framework; </li><li>  did authorization and user registration via Ajax; </li><li>  adding a comment with captcha, also via Ajax; </li><li>  Adding and removing points of interest from the travel list by dragging and dropping using jQuery, also through Ajax. </li></ul><br>  I did not have time to do the ‚Äúadmin panel‚Äù and sort the sights in the trip ticket. <br><br><h5>  Results </h5><br>  I did not win a prize, although I was in the top five.  Most importantly, I expanded and systematized my knowledge, identified my weak points and outlined a further direction for improvement.  Due to the restriction of access to the Internet, the preparation was thorough, the documentation was studied to such an extent that in case of a problem you immediately know where to look, although the Internet was not useful to me during the competition.  I believe that such competitions are needed, first of all, for students to improve their skills, find out what you are capable of and what you should pull up, meet new people and show yourself in action.  Maybe these competitions will also be valuable for employers who are looking for valuable personnel.  It seems to me that there are few students whose professional field of interest is not limited to the program of teaching, and who know how to put this knowledge into practice.  I have a year to fill in the gaps in my knowledge.  I hope next year to compete for a higher place. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/204458/">https://habr.com/ru/post/204458/</a></p>
