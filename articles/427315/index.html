      It took more than one hour to bring order to my person, and with the thought ‚ÄúWhat is good to disappear‚Äù decided to share it with Habr's readers.  I hope he will benefit and save time searching for literature. <br><br>  The list was divided into four categories: <br><br><ol><li>  Books about business; </li><li>  Design books - did not list classics, but supplemented with something new (in my opinion); </li><li>  Books on the psychology of behavior; </li><li>  Books about the texts. </li></ol><br>  For some books found sammari, links are attached. <br><br>  I would be grateful to everyone who complements the list with other useful books and references. <br>  Suggestions for expanding categories are also accepted.  As proposals arrive, I will supplement the list. <br><br>  I really want this article to bring maximum benefit not only to myself, but also to colleagues. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vc/3o/ue/vc3oueewa4qmcgxo6bokdbka-ta.png"><br><br><h2>  Bizes </h2><br><h3>  <a href="https://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/18322266/">1.

I think that it should be read by any beginner or advanced startups, especially those whose startup is constantly failing. <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/5412712/">2.

Anything that is different from most attracts attention and sets you apart from the rest.  After all, even an atypical coloring can provoke an unprecedented interest - imagine, for example, a purple cow among ordinary black, white and brown.  Be sure: you can always stand out, you only need to think about what in your industry no one else has done.  If you are the owner of the company or do marketing - this book is for you. <br><br>  <b>Ozon.ru rating:</b> 4 <br><br>  <b>Number of pages:</b> 176 <br><br>  <b>Testimonial:</b> I wanted to say that the book is more likely not for an outstanding business, but for people who want to create something unusual, in other words, a purple cow.  I do not recommend reading the book to those who are close to mediocrity and the desire not to stand out from the crowd.  I put 5 of 5. The book inspired me a lot and clarified many things about the advertising strategy and its perception. <br><br>  The book is about niches in business and dominance at the expense of the product, not advertising.  About new global trends.  About outstanding products. <br><br>  Leaves an ambiguous impression.  On the one hand, it has useful tips on how to make your business outstanding, and, rather, it is not even tips, but examples of successful companies that make you think and suggest how you could integrate their successful experience into your business. .  On the other hand, the author is very categorical in his statements and believes that it is much more risky to be the same company as everyone, rather than trying to be an outstanding company, taking the corresponding risks. <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://www.litres.ru/aleksandr-ostervalder/razrabotka-cennostnyh-predlozheniy-kak-sozdavat-tovary-i-uslugi-kotorye-zahotyat-kupit-potrebiteli-vash-pervyy-shag/">3.

Very inspiring, I want to immediately run and do something.  And although the thought ‚Äúthere were other times, somewhere was scratched, then it was all easier, they were pioneers ...‚Äù there is still an understanding that in 10-15-20 years they will also say about our time. <br><br>  The author is also very well reminded of the need to build and maintain a social atmosphere in the company and that not everything is decided by money ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/17/se/au/17seauyng8ttnez_znhzaiil7j0.png"><br><br><h2>  Design </h2><br><h3>  <a href="https://www.litres.ru/tereza-neyl/proektirovanie-veb-interfeysov-24500150/">1. Designing Web Interfaces</a> </h3>  Teresa Neil, Bill Scott <br><br>  <b>Description:</b> The authors offer more than 75 templates for creating their own convenient and attractive web applications.  These templates illustrate six key principles that make it possible to fully use the capabilities of modern web technologies and to ensure the effectiveness of the process of user interaction. <br><br>  For clarity, the book presents a large number of graphic samples taken from real functioning sites.  All illustrations in color version for detailed review can be downloaded from the publisher's website. <br><br>  The publication contains all the necessary information for the designer and developer to make the right decisions to create or update an interactive site or a rich web application.  This book should read every modern web designer.  The templates presented in it will serve as an excellent addition to the toolkit, useful reference material that will help both the novice and the experienced specialist in their work. <br><br>  <b>Liters Rating:</b> 4 <br><br>  <b>Number of pages:</b> 348 <br><br>  <b>Review:</b> Very interesting.  There is live material on UI / UX.  The authors are practitioners, and with achievements.  Despite the 2010 translation (and even earlier - the year of writing), little has changed.  Apparently, because the design of interfaces develops by jumps, from one revolution to another, and the one who thinks strategically, and in general - who thinks, wins.  Does not copy the mainstream. <br><br>  More to the authors, plus something that they write about, they also demonstrate ‚Äúin the flesh,‚Äù in practice. <br>  The book will certainly be useful.  Those who are accustomed to think, and pass the learned "through themselves."  For such readers, there is a base here to make a qualitative leap in development. <br><br><br><h3>  <a href="https://www.litres.ru/luis-rozenfeld/informacionnaya-arhitektura-v-internete-2-e-izdanie-24499910/">2.

According to experts, Lou and Peter wrote one of the best books on web design, the real Bible of the EA.  Most books on web development focus on either the graphics or the technical aspects of the site.  This edition discusses both.  The authors consider not only the user interface, the content and structure of the site, but also issues affecting the corporate hierarchy and policy.  You will learn how to develop a memorable and at the same time easy to use website, how to organize a site hierarchy and navigation systems on it, understandable to users, how to set up search systems that return meaningful results.  The principles outlined in this fully updated book will help you create websites that are easy to expand and maintain, more user-friendly and attractive to users. <br><br>  <b>Rating Liters:</b> 5 <br><br>  <b>Number of pages:</b> 534 <br><br>  <b>Review:</b> In my opinion, a very rare and high-quality book.

How we make decisions</a> </h3>  John lehrer <br><br>  <b>Description:</b> Every moment we make decisions: from very important to insignificant and everyday.  It is this property - the ability to make free choice - and makes a person a man. <br><br>  But how does this happen?  How does the brain, in a fraction of a second, process a tremendous amount of information?  How do the mind and intuition?  These questions occupy not only philosophers and neuroscientists, but also each of us.  John Lehrer not only fascinatingly describes how the decision-making mechanism works.  The book ‚ÄúHow we make decisions‚Äù talks about how the selection process takes place, and at the same time helps to make this process more efficient. <br><br>  <b>Ozon.ru rating:</b> 4 <br><br>  <b>Number of pages:</b> 352 <br><br>  <b>Review:</b> Simple abstracts with vivid, memorable examples.  Understandable logic of the book.  There are useful practical conclusions, especially about the balance between emotions and ratio when making important decisions.  The book is great!  This is the psychology that everyone should know.  Written clearly, clearly and very interesting.  Sometimes intuition is important, and sometimes you can not go on about the "erroneous intuition" and listen only to your mind.

Reveals patterns, why certain things happen. <br><br>  Very exciting and useful book!  Personally, I was most interested in how it turns out that something suddenly becomes extremely fashionable.  And in the book I found several excellent case studies on the subject - such as the history of the American shoe brand Hush Puppies, how it turned from being practically dying into a trendy one.  But other stories collected by Gladwell are no less exciting.  In the end, it's just interesting - to find out how some minor changes lead to significant consequences. <br><br>  Disadvantages: Many examples about the epidemic of disease and murder, a little unpleasant to read. <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/28741312/">6.

This book is for those who have read the ‚ÄúPsychology of Influence‚Äù and want to understand themselves, their decisions, and their relations with the outside world even more deeply.  A bit hard to read, but worth it.  Recommend! <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://www.litres.ru/pol-kleynman/psihologiya-ludi-koncepcii-eksperimenty/">8. Psychology.</a>  <a href="https://www.litres.ru/pol-kleynman/psihologiya-ludi-koncepcii-eksperimenty/">People, concepts, experiments</a> </h3>  Paul Kleinman <br><br>  <b>Description:</b> The author of this book has rejected boring details and statistics and offers the reader entertaining psychology lessons from which it is impossible to break away! <br>  The book will be useful for anyone interested in psychology, but does not have time to study the original sources. <br><br>  <b>Liters Rating:</b> 4 <br><br>  <b>Number of pages:</b> 280 <br><br>  <b>Review:</b> The book is good.  It is easy to read (for me it was important, since psychology is not the main activity).  The information is presented in excellent form, does not overload.  Do not have time to get bored, because the heads are rather small.  For me personally, there were no boring and tiring chapters in the book. <br><br>  Very good book.  For those who are interested in those on which the basic principles of psychology are based. <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://www.litres.ru/arndt-trayndl/neyromarketing-vizualizaciya-emociy/">9. Neuromarketing: Visualizing Emotions</a> </h3>  Arndt triple <br><br>  <b>Description:</b> The book is about how to comprehend the secrets of consumer behavior and induce to make a purchase, using the techniques of traditional marketing, complemented by the results of modern brain research.  She talks about neuromarketing - a new direction at the junction of two sciences, which allows you to use the knowledge of the laws of human perception to select a more accurate way of emotional impact on the buyer at points of sale. <br><br>  <b>Liters Rating:</b> 4 <br><br>  <b>Number of pages:</b> 110 <br><br>  <b>Review:</b> Do you want to understand such an interesting question as NEYMARKETING?  Then this book is what you need.  The book may not please everyone: it contains terms that are not familiar to most, but not so many.  I recommend psychologists and those who are interested in this topic. <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://www.litres.ru/dzhozef-hallinan/pochemu-my-oshibaemsya-lovushki-myshleniya-v-deystvii/">10. Why we are wrong.</a>  <a href="https://www.litres.ru/dzhozef-hallinan/pochemu-my-oshibaemsya-lovushki-myshleniya-v-deystvii/">Thinking traps in action</a> </h3>  Joseph Hallinan <br><br>  <b>Description:</b> All people are wrong, because our senses are imperfect.  However, most often this is due to the imperfections of our mind: we overestimate our abilities, we think in patterns and stereotypes, losing sight of important details.  Learning to make less mistakes, according to Joseph Hallinan, is very simple: you need to have a good rest, really assess the situation and your capabilities, ask for the help of others to check the decision and, of course, learn from their own and others' mistakes.  But there are secrets to this simplicity. <br><br>  <b>Liters Rating:</b> 4 <br><br>  <b>Number of pages:</b> 340 <br><br>  <b>Review:</b> The book is about the important: thinking, perception, memory, and more. <br>  All information is provided on the basis of research, statistics, and therefore reliable. <br>  The book will be interesting, as a lover of psychology, and psychologist. <br><br>  Written in a language understandable for the amateur, is also quite informative. <br>  There is no ‚Äúwater‚Äù ‚Äîas authors often like to describe one topic per third of a book. <br>  Everything is brief, clear, concise. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2z/ko/i-/2zkoi-sd7vk5yljcwrrea6_jtp8.png"><br><br><h2>  Texts </h2><br><h3>  <a href="https://book.glvrd.ru/">1.

And the most popular book by Robert Dilts, the genius of neuro-linguistic programming, will help you.  You just can not do without the "tricks of the language."  The point is that certain speech patterns (patterns) are able to transform the beliefs and perceptions of a situation, drastically changing our reactions to it.  In the three decades that have passed since their discovery, the ‚Äúfoci of language‚Äù have earned the right to be called the most effective method of influence and the best means of changing beliefs in the process of communication. <br><br>  <b>Ozon.ru rating:</b> 5 <br><br>  <b>Number of pages:</b> 256 <br><br>  <b>Review:</b> There is this book in the personal library.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Very sensible manual on working with the language, about what words to think and speak. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">One of the few noteworthy books, where the title or description is the abbreviation "NLP" (mostly, those - just garbage). </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Very interesting and self-sufficient edition! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Dana very detailed information on all sorts of manipulations. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the end of each chapter are given verification tasks.</font></font></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/427315/">https://habr.com/ru/post/427315/</a></p>
