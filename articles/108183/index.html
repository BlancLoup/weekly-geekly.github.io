I would like to answer them fully and publicly. <br><br>  <b>And what will happen to my site if you disappear?</b> <br><br>  You are not afraid that for example Masterhost will disappear?  And we are not going to disappear.  Is it in vain that we created this whole system?  In case of any cataclysms (the meteorite falls on the data center), you will have on your site templates and data, so with minimal cost you will transfer everything to another platform.  Another argument for us not to fade is that we have partners who trust the sites of their clients to us and we simply cannot let them down.  There is no going back. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      <b>Do you have a boxed CMS for installation on our hosting?</b> <br><br>  No and never will.  At least for the reason that it is much more convenient to maintain the system on their servers than on client servers.  By the way, in terms of cost, the latter will have to pay money for the service more than in the SaaS version. <br>  Moreover, CMS uses different not quite traditional technologies and most users will have problems in order to make it all work, and then also to maintain it in working condition.  About virtual hosting speech is not even going.  Who needs it? <br><br>  <b>And how much can I trust my data to you?</b> <br><br>  Exactly as much as you can trust any traditional hoster.  And even more, because  you provide your own scripts to a traditional hoster, and even your scripts are not here.  Only data and only what is available to any visitor to your site. <br><br>  <b>What if the capabilities of your system cease to be enough and I will have to move to some kind of my own solution?</b> <br><br>  First of all, you can always ask for something to work out for you (and therefore for the other users of the system), and more often we go forward.  This will be the best solution for everyone.  If this option does not work (too specific a task), then, as written above, you will have data and HTML templates for the move.  Of course, both the data and the templates will require processing to be transferred to the new platform, but this is real. <br><br><h4>  Results </h4><br><br>  Fortunately, most of our users understand that these minor features, which for many are pluses, overlap with the other benefits that SaaS provides.  The main thing is the ability to independently make a website without even knowing what HTML is.  Technical support always promptly helps with all questions.  And most importantly - saving time and money.  After all, at the very beginning of any business there is no opportunity to invest a lot of money in the site, and over time it becomes tight.  The case will grow up - there you will see it will remain on SaaS or make your site. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/108183/">https://habr.com/ru/post/108183/</a></p>
