When using this solution in combination with software rental, costs in medium and large business companies can be 2-3 times lower compared to building their own Data Center or maintaining a traditional server business.

      The key feature of the new solution is the ability to ‚Äúpush through‚Äù and connect the HASP physical keys from 1C in the ‚Äúcloud‚Äù, providing hardware and software protection for the software.  The <a href="http://www.activecloud.ru/ru/services/cloudserver/hosting1c/">‚ÄúHosting 1C‚Äù service</a> from <b>ActiveCloud</b> provides the ability to select a storage system for those loads that are required for a specific client solution.  Storage systems offer a choice of arrays built on conventional or high-speed solid-state SSD disks that will provide large I / O operations ( <b>IOPS</b> ), which is especially important and critical when working with a large number of users or using large and constantly growing databases.  Thus, the client will not overpay for the performance or unnecessary technical parameters that he does not need.  The implemented functionality of the fault tolerance and security of the cloud platform for hosting 1C allows you to minimize the stopping of business processes related to working with 1C products. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  <i>‚ÄúUnlike the 1C rental service, where configuration and configuration for a client is not possible, the <a href="http://www.activecloud.ru/ru/services/cloudserver/hosting1c/">1C Hosting</a> offer from Activecloud allows companies to transfer their version of the program with settings and configurations, with any base size, number of users, select a storage system for any load protection of financial information "</i> </blockquote>  - said Andrian Bushin, director of development for <b>ActiveCloud</b> . <br><br>  The service includes a number of additional and important features, such as site selection (Russia, Europe or CIS countries), connecting an Internet port with guaranteed channels up to 1 Gb / s for a server cluster to a client, unlimited Russian and foreign traffic, monitoring and control system allocated resources. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>‚ÄúA number of Russian companies and our existing clients have already tried the solution in practice.</i>  <i>Even in such a short time, this service proved to companies the effect of using such an approach, which makes it possible to significantly reduce costs for several items of expenses for building and maintaining IT infrastructure, purchasing, licensing and legalizing software.</i>  <i>The actual result exceeded the expectations of our customers.</i>  <i>They ensured business continuity and security of financial data due to significantly higher reliability of the service and saved up to 20 times on the purchase of software, equipment and infrastructure ‚Äù</i> </blockquote>  - says Andrian Bushin. <br><br>  Publication: <a href="http://cloudzone.ru/news/2011/07/12/137.html">cloudzone.ru</a> <br><br>  Features and Benefits <br><br>  * Effective protection of corporate information from physical intervention and seizure. <br>  * Protection against unauthorized access to data (access keys). <br>  * Control over all user actions. <br>  * Installation and operation of any HASP USB keys (installation in the cloud). <br>  * Work with 1C and other programs without installation on the computer. <br>  * Access and remote work from anywhere in the world. <br>  * One environment for all offices / divisions. <br>  * Choice of placement sites (Russia, CIS, Europe). <br>  * Power and flexibility solutions for any load. <br>  * Guaranteed availability of 99.9% (provide SLA - Service Level Agreement). <br>  * Reduced hardware costs and licensed software. <br>  * The choice of storage system (possible high-speed storage on SSD). <br><br>  Security <br><br>  Confidential information is missing on the physical machines of the office, which eliminates its leakage even with the physical loss of company equipment in the office. <br><br>  Encryption systems and daily data backups will ensure a high level of confidentiality and guarantee the security of corporate information. <br><br>  Having encrypted keys guarantees access to corporate information only for certain employees of your company. <br><br>  ActiveCloud specialists provide round-the-clock monitoring of the state of the server and the entire infrastructure, providing a higher level of fault tolerance than in a regular office. <br>  Secure access anywhere <br><br>  Using a software or physical USB hasp-key allows secure access to the database anywhere. <br><br>  The solution will allow to unite branches in regions, warehouses, remote employees and provide them with access to the accounting program at any time, regardless of their location. <br>  Saving <br><br>  To open a new office or branch does not require capital expenditures for the purchase of additional server equipment, its configuration and the maintenance of a staff of specialists. <br>  What is included in the service? <br><br>  * Choice of the placement site (Russia - Moscow, Europe - the Netherlands, CIS). <br>  * Ensuring secure access and encryption of customer data. <br>  * Daily data backup. <br>  * Organization of terminal access staff. <br>  * Rental of licensed software. <br>  * Choice of storage system. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/124360/">https://habr.com/ru/post/124360/</a></p>
