  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The story of Black Friday. Why do Americans love her so much?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  November 25 in the US and Europe will be the biggest sale of the year - <a href="https://qwintry.com/landing/2016-blackfriday-usa%3Futm_source%3DGeekTimes%26utm_medium%3DBlack_Friday%26utm_campaign%3Dautumn16">Black Friday</a> .  Black Friday has long been a national entertainment for Americans: stores free warehouses before the New Year, and shoppers sweep away virtually everything.  Gadgets, clothes, shoes, toys, jewelry and hundreds of other goods will be waiting for us on the shelves of online stores with discounts up to 90%. <br><br>  Last year, a third of Americans instead of the traditional dinner with a Thanksgiving turkey went shopping to get the best deals before everyone else.  According to Google Trends, on Black Friday, most are interested in gadgets, half of buyers are DVDs and Blu-ray, 48% are not averse to updating their wardrobe, 45% want to buy new video games. <br><br>  On sales in November-December 2016, Americans will spend $ 656 billion. Banderolka decided to figure out <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/banderolka/blog/282744/">where the attraction of unprecedented generosity called ‚ÄúBlack Friday‚Äù came from and why Americans love it so much ‚ûú</a>

It was he who in 1873 in the small town of Lancaster in Pennsylvania, organized the first sales. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a1d/6f3/8f9/a1d6f38f990349b48c975ff0a2d45176.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The young boy Woolworth came from a peasant family, lived in the backwoods of the country, but didn‚Äôt want to clean up his life after the cows and plow the land.  Opportunities to get an education were not, special talents - too, but shyness was in abundance.  It remained to go to work as a laborer.  My father added a 21-year-old boy to the store as a sales assistant.  The duties of the future millionaire included cleaning floors, folding goods and the "divorce" of buyers. <br><br><blockquote>  In those years, the sellers themselves determined the price of the goods: with the help of a trained eye and ingenious conversations, they had to figure out the client's solvency and only then set prices. </blockquote><br>  Poor Woolworth suffered greatly because of this duty, and when they wanted to fire him, he came up with one trick.  He threw all the seasonal goods onto the counter and put a sign next to it, ‚ÄúAll five cents.‚Äù  This was the first sale in the United States! <br><br>  For the change, the guy made 6 daily store receipts, slammed the door and started his own enterprise, where there were fixed prices everywhere and sales were held regularly.  This is how the largest retail chain of the early twentieth century appeared. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2c7/833/676/2c7833676a75433a820fc3d62fdb3f45.png"><br><br>  30 years after those events, Frank Woolworth and US President Woodrow Wilson discovered the sights of New York - the 238-meter-high Woolworth Building, which cost its owner $ 14 million. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#ff8300">"Who came up, say these traffic jams"</font> </h3><br>  When stable prices and sales became common, sellers quickly realized that they received the most profit before Christmas when people bought gifts.  Hence the tradition of arranging the biggest sales immediately after Thanksgiving Day (November 24) - this is how buyers got a whole month to make all their purchases, and delivery services (such as Banderolka) bring them on the eve of the main winter holidays.  That is how Black Friday appeared - a time of quick sales immediately after Thanksgiving. <br><br>  The term "Black Friday" appeared much later. <br><br>  In 1951, the Factory Management and Maintenance magazine noticed an interesting trend: after Thanksgiving, many workers took time off for health reasons, and in fact, they wanted to arrange a four-day mini-vacation for themselves - probably to quietly go shopping in search of discounts. <br><br>  Around the same time, the expression "Black Friday" began to be used by police officers from Philadelphia, shocked by the unreal traffic jams that occurred on Friday after Thanksgiving Day.  Naturally, sellers (who set unprecedented discounts, just like now) and buyers (who gave up everything and went shopping - just like now) blamed for traffic jams. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jW2kBmkAk9I" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Finally, there is another version why this day is called Black Friday.  The thing is that in American accounting, losses are marked in red, and profits - in black.  You can guess for yourself that the Friday after Thanksgiving is one of the most profitable periods of the year.  Both for sellers and buyers! <br><br>  You can get your benefit on November 25th with the <a href="https://qwintry.com/%3Futm_source%3DGeekTimes%26utm_medium%3DBlack_Friday%26utm_campaign%3Dautumn16">Parcel Post</a> .
