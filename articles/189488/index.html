I went to one of the sites I was used to, and came across such a lock on this resource. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/242/a75/401/242a75401026889ae249689cf9ddd556.jpg" alt="blocking"><br><br>  <b>"These are the times!"</b> - I thought.  This resource was not present in any registry of banned sites and it is unclear why the Beeline blocked it.  Naturally, after such ‚Äúapplications‚Äù, terrible thoughts got into my head: ‚Äúwhat if tomorrow there won't be a favorite‚Äú kin ‚Äù!‚Äù  These thoughts immediately prompted me to start looking for ways to deal with this situation, and write, for those who are interested, a small overview of several solutions to bypass site blocking.

      Of course, there are a lot of ways, ranging from proxies, VPNs, anonymizers, and ending with IPv6.  But I will describe a few that I liked by certain criteria, in this case it is: ease of installation and configuration and speed of work. <br><br>  I will make a reservation right away, I do not use all kinds of online anonymizers, since there is no trust in these services and it is not clear where you are transferring your authorization data.  Well, I will not write about VPN - they are usually paid.  The article is designed for a simple inhabitant, so I will try to describe the easiest ways to view blocked sites. <br><br>  I used the service <a href="http://2ip.ru/">2ip.ru</a> to determine the IP address, provider, availability of a proxy and speed measurement.  So, let's begin. <br><br><h3>  1) Tor Browser <a href="http://www.torproject.us/">www.torproject.us</a> </h3><br>  Tor is free software that helps protect you from Internet censorship and traffic analysis from all sorts of special services. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/461/926/54a/46192654a58b9ca9e2253c8e5a127fe8.jpg"><br>  Tor has been known in the IT community for a long time.  There were no problems with the search and installation of this product. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ff1/1f9/dfc/ff11f9dfc63a09c5ef3de0c4f908a2e1.jpg" alt="Tor IP Address"><br>  As can be seen from the above screen, Tor provides complete anonymity for surfing.  The real IP address is not determined. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b4b/4c5/b6c/b4b4c5b6c91f6daa0d2f4b6e442134c9.gif" alt="Tor speed"><br>  The incoming speed of 2.4 MB / s allows you to comfortably surf on sites that are not overloaded with various flash and other types of advertising, which is currently rare. <br>  <b>Pros</b> : <br><ul><li>  access to blocked sites; </li><li>  complete lack of history; </li><li>  completely free product; </li><li>  There is no advertising embedded in the pages. </li></ul><br>  <b>Cons</b> : <br><ul><li>  separate software (browser); </li><li>  brakes at start with Tor networks; </li><li>  overall low speed. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Conclusion: </h4>  Of course, he performs his task, but using Tor is not always comfortable.  And to launch it in order to surf only on sites with good movies is not very practical. <br><br><h3>  2) then the friGate extension <a href="https://fri-gate.org/ru/">https://fri-gate.org/</a> </h3><br>  Addition (extension) to the <b>friGate</b> browser as written on the developer‚Äôs site ‚Äúallows access to erroneously blocked sites without causing any inconvenience.  With the help of the original algorithm of work, the speed of access to the sites is practically not reduced, which is very important, both for users of the extension and for site owners. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f96/763/3c5/f967633c5a3cbd84ba26744c3c8b6a73.jpg" alt="Picture from Chrome online store"><br><br>  There are versions for Chrome, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/frigate/">Firefox</a> and Opera.  I tested for Google Chrome (Chrome <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/frigate/mbacbcfdfaapbcnlnbmciiaakomhkbkb">online store</a> ), but the same for other proxy platforms.  I was interested in the phrase "the speed of access to sites is not reduced." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/091/36e/a2d/09136ea2d48ad1fe2b2cad786da8bb0d.jpg" alt="friGate proxy is not anonymous"><br><br>  Service 2ip.ru shows that the proxy transmits the source address and is not anonymous.  It turns out in the settings you can enable anonymity, but by default it is not enabled. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8c4/ce2/18e/8c4ce218e11413180b77bbf6f5eb939a.gif" alt="friGate decent access speed"><br><br>  The incoming speed of 22 MB / s honestly pleased me, I did not get that speed from other methods I tested.  This access speed allows you to go to the blocked resources with the same speed as without using a proxy server. <br>  <b>Pros</b> : <br><ul><li>  expansion without problems - everything is simple: control - turned on / off; </li><li>  access to sites that are not included in the expansion list, occurs bypassing the proxy, + if the site is directly accessible, the proxy is also not included; </li><li>  in the settings you can add your sites to the list, you can also use your own proxies (for paranoids) </li><li>  https proxy - traffic is encrypted and compressed using Google PageSpeed.  True, it all happens with the traffic that goes through the proxy, of course </li><li>  free; </li><li>  decent access speed; </li></ul><br>  <b>Cons</b> : <br><ul><li>  not yet found </li></ul><br><br><h5>  Conclusion: </h5>  I personally liked the extension.  I use almost only chrome.  Through the proxy goes traffic, if only the resource is blocked, otherwise everything is direct - it suits me.  Well, I added several sites to my own list, which they do not have in their global list - everything is super. <br><br><h3>  3) Stealthy Lite <a href="http://www.stealthy.co/">www.stealthy.co</a> </h3><br>  Does your country or organization have access to facebook, YouTube or other sites?  Are there services that are not available in your country?  Stealthy is the solution for you.  Unlike other extensions, we are constantly looking for quick proxies for you.  By the way, it is alarming: "we are constantly looking for quick proxies for you" <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/875/8c6/0c1/8758c60c1cec8d89f04731e33ba0df99.jpg" alt="Stealthy"><br><br>  In the Lite version, the extension (addition) gets a random proxy from the list of available ones or it is possible to specify a country, but again if it is on the list.  The recommended proxy (United States, United Kingdom) is available only in the PRO version. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a5c/9e8/083/a5c9e8083051cea7c3592ac9889b8009.jpg" alt="Stealthy ip"><br>  The 2ip.ru service determines that the Stealthy extension uses a non-anonymous proxy server.  Smiley, which is next to the IP address - as it turned out I had a happy IP (the sum of the first half numbers is equal to the sum of the second half of the address), which gave me the right to register without an invite and the opportunity to invite 10 people to 2ip.ru :). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/87f/9c4/4bc/87f9c44bc9c0f95307a6b83ba5cbec33.gif" alt="Stealthy speed no fountain"><br>  Input speed 2.2 MB / s.  Addition Stealthy, when compared with friGate, is much inferior in speed.  For surfing, in principle, should be enough. <br>  <b>Pros</b> : <br><ul><li>  no need to use special software; </li><li>  after installing the extension there is no need to configure it; </li><li>  the extension is for both Chrome and Firefox; </li><li>  lack of advertising embedded in the pages. </li></ul><br>  <b>Cons</b> : <br><ul><li>  the extension has been updated for a very long time, it is not clear whether it is still supported at all </li><li>  when the extension is enabled, all traffic goes through a proxy, so you have to use the on / off button; </li><li>  very low speed. </li></ul><br><br><h5>  Conclusion: </h5>  Stealthy, as an alternative to other methods of access to blocked sites, proved to be quite not bad.  The inconvenience occurs only when you have to disable or enable this extension.  Well, low speed through free proxies leaves much to be desired. <br><br><h3>  4) Ultrasurf <a href="http://ultrasurf.us/">ultrasurf.us</a> </h3><br>  Ultrasurf is a product of the Internet company UltraReach.  Ultrasurf was created to help Internet users from China gain freedom on the Internet.  ON Ultrasurf software at the moment has become one of the most popular in the world to combat censorship.  Millions of people use it to circumvent Internet censorship and privacy on the Internet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/966/78e/4b2/96678e4b2f6d823da7d214f65cf3c54d.jpg" alt="Ultrasurf"><br>  Using anonymous surfing and browsing.  Ultrasurf hides your real IP address, cleans your browsing history, cookies and more. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/aff/bbf/7b8/affbbf7b8c208cec7dc12abdaaf88199.jpg" alt="Ultrasurf"><br>  Service 2ip.ru when determining the IP address, writes "proxy is not used," which gives us the so-called anonymity.  Servers always have the IP of the same country, in this case, the United States. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3e7/2a3/49c/3e72a349c49c19533299f4d34babbe77.gif" alt="Ultrasurf"><br>  With the incoming speed of 0.5 MB / s, you involuntarily recall the beginning of the Internet era in Russia. <br>  <b>Pros</b> : <br><ul><li>  complete, as stated on the developer‚Äôs site, anonymity </li><li>  no browser binding </li><li>  the ability to configure any software to use through this proxy </li></ul><br>  <b>Cons</b> : <br><ul><li>  the need to run additional software; </li><li>  embedded advertising in the pages; </li><li>  manual configuration of browsers to use a proxy (the button is only for FF); </li><li>  very low speed of access to sites; </li><li>  buggy - periodically Ultrasurf falls out with an error. </li></ul><br><br><h5>  <b>Conclusion:</b> </h5>  <b>An annoying advertisement, which, by the way, did not exist before, as it is not correctly embedded in the pages and sometimes interferes with the full-fledged viewing of the site.</b>  <b>Ultrasurf can only be used briefly and as an alternative to other methods with higher speed.</b>  <b>Wait for the full page load on some sites takes a long time, which is a complete inconvenience when surfing the net.</b> <br><br><h3>  5) fasTun <a href="http://fastun.ru/">fastun.ru</a> </h3><br>  Welcome to fasTun - Free Internet Accelerator with traffic compression.  fasTun will allow you to increase data download speed and reduce your Internet costs by 2-10 times!  This service, of course, is intended a bit for another, but at the moment many users are using it as another alternative to access blocked resources. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b7b/ed1/93b/b7bed193b939b673c133a68fd0f97343.jpg" alt="fasTun"><br>  fasTun can do the following: Compress HTTP traffic using the GZIP algorithm, optimize the code of web pages (HTTP / CSS), thereby reducing their size and compressing the images in PNG, GIF and JPEG formats with a choice of quality. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b02/d1d/541/b02d1d541eca8b68ad126d23a88abb9e.jpg" alt="fasTun"><br>  2ip.ru uniquely determines that the proxy is used, but does not show the IP address for the proxy.  The server always has the same IP address, in this case Germany.  On the same server is the fasTun service. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8b8/d69/8a2/8b8d698a29d9b0dd173a73775db2be13.gif" alt="fasTun"><br>  The fastun.ru website claims a speed of 128 Kbps and, as it turned out, the fasTun service also has a premium mode, in which the connection speed rises to 3 Mb / s.  The real speed measurement by the 2ip.ru service showed the following result: the incoming speed is 135.69 Kb / s. <br>  <b>Pros</b> : <br><ul><li>  extensions for Firefox and Opera browsers; </li><li>  compress HTTP traffic; </li><li>  lack of advertising embedded in the pages. </li></ul><br>  <b>Cons</b> : <br><ul><li>  manual configuration of other browsers; </li><li>  very low speed of access to sites; </li><li>  never found an opportunity to pay a premium - well, not necessary. </li></ul><br><br><h5>  <b>Conclusion:</b> </h5>  <b>This service allows you to bypass the blocking of sites by the provider.</b>  <b>It also allows you to save traffic by compressing using the GZIP algorithm, which is currently only relevant for mobile platforms.</b>  <b>But the relatively low speed again makes surfing unbearable.</b> <br><br><h3>  General conclusion: </h3>  <b>Of all the ways I have tested to circumvent the blocking of sites by the provider, I would leave for my own needs only one thing: <a href="https://fri-gate.org/ru/">friGate</a> .</b> <br>  And the speed is normal and convenient to use. <br><br>  By the way, there is still a great way to raise the tunnel to an ipv6 broker (both free and without loss of speed in practice), but many sites do not have an AAAA address. <br><br>  UPD.  I was prompted here by another method - <a href="https://immunicity.org/">immunicity.org</a> .  This is a script for automatically setting up a proxy, downloaded to the browser directly from their site, the list of sites is constantly expanding.  For me, it is inconvenient that you cannot turn off / on with one click, but the whole idea is not bad. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/189488/">https://habr.com/ru/post/189488/</a></p>
