    <h4>  Digital for <nobr>business breakfast</nobr> </h4><br>  A small entrepreneur wakes up in the morning and realizes that he is terrified by the lack of digital in his body and is empty in the fridge.  The entrepreneur is not a fool.  I guess that you need to look for semi-finished products: ‚Äúready-made solutions‚Äù, ‚Äútools‚Äù and other saas.  He goes, it means, in <a href="http://google.com/">Google</a> and on <a href="https://vc.ru/">Zuckerberg</a> and sees there <nobr>darkness, confusing</nobr> solutions, tools and saas.  We must take. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a14/8e9/9c4/a148e99c43e840f3904ce4024e73d116.png"><br><br>  And then what's interesting is obtained.  The fact is that sellers of solutions, tools and saas do not understand business.  Well, do not be offended.  In a small business do not understand.  They know how to more economically invest investor money.  Voronochka can build. <br><br>  They do not understand - and should not!  There is no fault of the sellers. <br><br>  But.  But <nobr>for some reason they</nobr> consider it their duty to teach clients how to do business.  Warehouse program tells me how to triple sales.  <nobr>Task Manager</nobr> tells me how to triple sales.  The chat on the site - it would seem, just a small programmerinka - tells me how to triple sales. <br><br>  Do Landing!  Customize targeting!  Put the call back!  Order the selling text! <br><blockquote>  <i>Long, long crocodile</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Sea blue stewed</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Pies and pancakes,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>And dried mushrooms.</i> </blockquote><br><br><h4>  Where are you, <nobr>online consultant</nobr> ? </h4><br>  Let's open America.  How is it in adults?  There is a vendor, there is an integrator, there is a consultant and all that jazz.  Like in a small business?  Vendor, buyer, in the middle - a hole. <br><br>  Are there any consultants for small businesses?  Well, there is an army of information managers who, a) understand business worse than vendors;  b) do not understand anything in the tools and saas. <br><br>  There are helpful consultants.  But, <nobr>firstly</nobr> , they are difficult to distinguish from charlatans.  <nobr>Secondly</nobr> , they are usually representatives of the ‚Äúold school‚Äù.  They cheerfully advise about finances and conduct a vital educational program, but they also don‚Äôt understand tools.  And of course, this should not be another story - about money and processes.  Important, but different. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0e0/3b2/2cb/0e03b22cb3c642df8624b07499691c00.png"><br><br>  So it turns out that there is no normal <nobr>integrator consultant</nobr> who will come and tell you how to use chat so that the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/Lepinskikh/ss-54286392/16%3Fsrc%3Dclipshare">conversion does not fall by 15%</a> .  Which advises <a href="https://www.olark.com/">Olark</a> instead of <a href="http://www.jivosite.ru/">Jivosayt</a> , because it is cheaper and more convenient.  Or vice versa - Zhivosayt, because there is a necessary feature.  And then he will come running and tell you that there is a free version of <a href="https://chatra.io/">Chatra</a> , which is good, but ... <br><br>  Recently read two reviews of services for <nobr>online stores</nobr> .  One is <a href="http://www.seonews.ru/analytics/sravnenie-konstruktorov-dlya-internet-magazinov/">old</a> , the other is <a href="https://vc.ru/p/shop-constructor">new</a> .  And cried.  Twice.  Because the authors do not seem to understand anything about the practical application of the tools they are talking about. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b15/6bb/8d5/b156bb8d531f412bb5497b3d54c8b3e2.png"><br><br>  You can not put in one row <a href="http://umi.ru/">Yumi.ru</a> and <a href="http://insales.ru/">Insalez</a> .  You can not compare the two systems only on the characteristics of the official site.  The same Insales - it's cool, but the price of ownership you need to throw 30-50 thousand for the design.  But it integrates with <a href="http://moysklad.ru/">MyStorage</a> .  Ideally integrated, not conditionally, as Yumi.ru.  But Yumi.ru is really easy to administer.  It's really simple - this is when you can explain to your grandmother, and not when you are driving naughty blocks of the <a href="http://wix.com/">Wix</a> constructor around the screen. <br><br>  <nobr>Wow</nobr> , easy!  Maybe Yumi.ru has already gotten married with MyStore and the appearance of Wix.ru is set up as simple as possible.  A year has passed since I picked it up.  That is, even I can not be trusted! <br><br>  <nobr>Anything</nobr> else?  Well, for example, chatting with <a href="http://vk.com/">VKontakte</a> can be more useful for working together with <a href="http://megaplan.ru/">Megaplan</a> .  However, our friendly shop uses <a href="http://slack.com/">Slak</a> - the guys there are more intelligent than we, and integrate this Slack into the tail and into the mane. <br><br>  I hope, by this moment you already got bewildered.  What does this author confuse warm with soft?  What does it have to do with tools?  Who ever gave the word?  I tried, thank you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/05a/699/0a6/05a6990a67d24274b424216e0568ebac.png"><br><br><h4>  It became a sea to rot </h4><br>  You guessed it, that I just do not understand anything in business and software.  We have <nobr>to somehow</nobr> poke, roam and wade through the "morning sale" to a coherent description of opportunities.  And then also test it in practice.  Oh, did not work!  In <nobr>words, they</nobr> promised gold mountains, but in practice, it is easier to cut the gugloform or to plant a person with pens. <br><br>  What did <nobr>you</nobr> want to <nobr>say</nobr> ?  And that's what. <br><blockquote>  <i>Who is told to tweet - Do not purr!</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Whom to purr - Do not tweet!</i> </blockquote><br>  In an ideal world, developers do not push the explosive growth in sales, but make convenient and functional software.  For big ones, for small companies.  In the box or in the cloud.  And the info-businessmen who have learned a good match, from this software collect working <nobr>business decisions</nobr> . <br><br><blockquote>  <i>Just a darling</i> <i><br></i>  <i>There was a good boy:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Not meow</i> <i><br></i>  <i>And not grunted -</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Under the cabbage lay.</i> </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/052/1e5/d75/0521e5d7532645cb8c974f976c057981.png"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296516/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296516/</a></p>
