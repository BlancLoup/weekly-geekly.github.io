I will try to look at this problem a bit from the other side - from the part of the university teacher who is trying to sow sensible, kind and sometimes eternal. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Since 2003, I have been teaching C # programming to students at a branch of a large Moscow university.  The choice of the C # language was realized, since at that time there was simply nothing better than teaching the fundamentals of algorithms, OOP, and user interface development.  C # has changed, the topics that I have sought to consider in my subjects have changed, but students have changed most of all in these 7 years.  Do you mind if we talk about them?

    <h5>  Symptoms </h5><br>  The last 3-4 years there has been a strange trend.  It seems that the teachers are the same, and the lecture courses, and the development environment, and the level of preparation of students for the 4th course, when they are moving from the basics of programming to more complex things, it becomes lower and lower. <br>  Students are inert, what was given at the lecture at the exam can only tell the best students, but they, when trying to ask a question to the side, to think, fall into a stupor. <br><br><h5>  Disease </h5><br>  Can you imagine a student of 2-3 courses seeking to get a higher education in the IT field and who has not read a single book this year?  I'm not talking about books related to the specialty, I'm talking generally about books.  A man has not read a single book in almost half a year!  Just do not say that you also did not read, and you have the Internet, and there ... They did not read the Internet either.  So how can you?  And I can, and not only imagine, I see them at my lectures every week. <br>  Recalling my recent student body, and especially the students of the group in which I studied, I cannot remember anyone who would not be interested in anything else.  We had people in the group who were seriously and for a long time carried away by programming, circuit engineering, modeling using various CAD systems, database design, network administration, web design and many others.  Today's student believes that having come to class, he has already committed an act worthy of admiration.  It is not necessary to be interested in the subject. <br>  Or from the last one, in November, I, replacing another teacher, told 3rd year students about delegates and events.  Already in May, with these students, we needed delegates to solve the problem ‚Äî not one remembered what it was. <br><br><h5>  Diagnosis </h5><br>  In our country, students have long and stubbornly argued that they are not necessarily studying, they need to have a diploma.  And they proved it consistently and systematically. <br><br>  The first step in this long journey was the emergence of an incredible number of commercial universities.  Without space, teachers, equipment, they began to produce specialists, masters, bachelors as fried cakes.  Flow.  For example, in 2005, according to the <a href="http://www.kp.ru/daily/23618.5/47210/">rector of MUH</a> , 100 thousand people graduated from the university, in the same year, from <a href="http://www.msunews.ru/news/1877/">Sadovnichy‚Äôs</a> speech, we learn that MSU congratulates its 5 thousand graduates.  Impressive? <br>  It did not help, the students continued to strive to master the exact sciences.  Continue? <br><br>  The second stage was the introduction of the USE, you can discuss its pros and cons, but there is a law, and all this law must comply.  So?  And what does this law tell us?  Responsibility for the recruitment of universities is now borne by the school, and it is not profitable for the school to show that its graduates do not have time and we get excellent grades of the Unified State Exam in Mathematics from applicants who cannot add the Unified State Exam on three exams. <br><br>  The third stage began maybe a little earlier than the first two, but after them it became fatal for universities.  You know that the number of university professors does not depend on the number of subjects that students should master, not on the number of specialties for which the university prepares, but simply on the number of students.  I explain with an example, expelled n students, please kindly dismiss m teachers, where n / m = 4 in prestigious technical universities. <br><br>  And what we have at the exit: <br>  1. A schoolboy does not want to learn, because he understands that in any case his parents will make a diploma. <br>  2. The school teacher, in order not to let the school down, puts a high ball on the USE. <br>  3. The applicant enters the university (for the curious, in our area, located two hundred kilometers from Moscow, in 2010 the number of school graduates is less than the number of places in universities). <br>  4. A university cannot deduct a student because  see about the third stage. <br><br>  And what do we get at the exit?  Right person with a diploma, not aspiring to learn, not willing to work. <br><br><h5>  Treatment </h5><br>  I do not like it when they start telling what needs to be done so that everyone can live better.  We can speculate about the cancellation of the USE, the allocation of money to universities in the amount that they can justify and much more about that, but ... I will not.  I will go and try, well, at least for those who are interested, to give a lecture in their free time, at which we will again analyze the delegates, and suddenly there will be more healthy people in our country. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/92820/">https://habr.com/ru/post/92820/</a></p>
