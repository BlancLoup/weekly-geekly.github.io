But at the moment the final of the story has not yet been written.  And we undertake to tell this story, which takes place in real time, from today to the very end, whatever it is. <br><br>  So that the reader does not get bored, we will mix technical articles with our memories and information about the current state of affairs.  Perhaps we start with a description of the project. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Small introduction</b> <br>  At many venues where projects are required to be presented, they like the presentation to start with a consumer problem that the project would solve.  This is an indicator question that allows you to determine whether the project creators understand what they are doing and why.  If the problem is obvious and well-known - the presentation immediately arouses interest and inspires confidence.  Well, if the problem does not lie on the surface?  Then the jury believes that they face another bunch of dreamers, who first invent problems and then solve them.  The mistrust that appeared at this stage cannot be redeemed, no matter how much you climbed out of the skin in the future.

      How to prove that the problem really exists, and it exists exactly in the form in which the authors declare?  To do this, you have to rise to a higher level.  No problem is unthinkable without need: a desert traveler‚Äôs lack of water would not be a problem if he didn‚Äôt need it.  Therefore, it is necessary to begin the story with a description of the problem, and a description of the need. <br><br>  <b>1. What user need do we satisfy?</b> <br>  We hope everyone will agree that there are people who have a need for ‚Äúself-improvement‚Äù, ‚Äúdevelopment‚Äù.  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D1%2583,_%25D0%2590%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2585%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC_%25D0%25A5%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25B4">Maslow</a> singled out these needs even in a separate class of higher needs, which rise to their full height when a person is full, dressed and safe.  The need for development can be seen firsthand when people declare that they would like to become "smarter", "more cultured", "more attractive" or even "more self-confident."  When it comes to "spiritual development" or "personal growth" - this is also a manifestation of the need for development. <br><br>  If the need really exists, then there must be people who are willing to pay for its satisfaction.  That is, there must be some kind of market for meeting this need.  And such a market exists.  Well, let's look at this market. <br><br>  <i>Books</i> <br>  The market for self-development books is huge;  Every year new author's techniques appear that promise the reader amazing life benefits after mastering a new technique.  Especially nimble authors publish several books at once, each of which is without fail the ‚Äúbest of its kind‚Äù.  Speed ‚Äã‚Äãreading, development of attention, memory, logic for dummies, books about how to influence people, all sorts of tutorials, the notorious "secret" is just the tip of the iceberg. <br><br>  <i>Trainings</i> <br>  The market for personal growth trainings is even bigger; entire companies are already working on it.  Hundreds of psychological methods and approaches generate more and more new schools of personal growth, each of which guarantees a quick and fantastic effect.  Hemispheric drawing, courses on systems thinking, methods of auto-suggestion, NLP - thousands of them. <br><br>  <i>And even religious services!</i> <br>  Even more impressive success was achieved by the sales industry of "spiritual development".  Everyone has heard about the books of the odious Ron Hubbard, the creator of Scientology, who became famous for creating his own religious movement and selling books on success and career to millions of millions of copies. <br><br>  In general, thousands of authors of books and articles, hundreds of companies and even several ‚Äúchurches‚Äù earn money on decent human aspiration.  <u>The market exists, and if so, then there is a need.</u> <br><br>  <b>What user problem are we solving?</b> <br>  There is a need.  And the problem is the difficulty that arises in meeting the need.  Let's find the difficulty. <br><br>  <i>Difficulty number 1.</i> <br>  It is difficult to come up with concepts that are more blurry and vague than ‚Äúpersonal growth‚Äù and ‚Äúspiritual development.‚Äù  Any meaning can be put into them, which is what charlatans of all stripes use. This is the problem - sometimes it is difficult for people to express exactly what they expect to get from the ‚Äúgrowth and development‚Äù methods. <br>  Is there a way to move from dubious terms of development and growth to more specific concepts, the use of which would allow to get the expected and well-known result?  We came to the conclusion that this method is only one: <u>to move away from the concept of growth and go to the plane of setting and achieving goals, when the results you have to achieve are agreed in advance.</u> <br><br>  <i>Difficulty number 2.</i> <br>  Now we will put ourselves in the place of a simple consumer of ‚Äúdevelopment services‚Äù.  As a user, do I need another tool for setting goals (such as drift boards that already exist in abundance?).  The answer is no.  For a person who knows what he wants, there is enough sheet and pen for setting goals to write them down and think about the steps. <br>  And what, in this case, does the consumer need for ‚Äúdevelopment services‚Äù?  What is he looking for by joining Scientologists, buying books on self-development and attending personal growth seminars?  <u>He is not looking for a way to set goals, but for a beaten track</u> , which could be walked without overstraining.  However, the roads that offer books, sects and trainings, for the most part, lead nowhere.  So let's offer the user a beaten track that will lead him to a specific, clearly defined goal.  And the goals are popular and attractive. <br><br>  <i>Difficulty number 3</i> <br>  The consumer of ‚Äúdevelopment services‚Äù, as a rule, is not interested in the process itself, but in the result.  Accordingly, <u>everything possible should be done so that the user gets the specified result with the maximum probability</u> - then and only then the need for development will be satisfied to the fullest extent. <br><br>  Accordingly, the solution of these problems should: <br>  1) have a mechanism for setting specific, measurable and popular goals (specifically in the field of development, this is not about buying a new iPhone) <br>  2) the user should be provided with very specific ways to achieve the goals - the very beaten paths that the consumer needs development services <br>  3) conditions should be created that increase the likelihood of achieving a result.  The creators of the product should do everything possible, use all available methods to increase user motivation, remove anxiety due to lack of awareness, show that achieving goals is fashionable, everyone is capable of it;  stir up competition between users.  Do everything to make life easier for the user in this direction. <br><br>  <b>Our solution.</b> <br>  The basic requirements for the solution are ready, the audience is clear and the solution becomes obvious. <br>  We want to offer the user a system that will inspire him to develop, guide on a proven and reliable path and maintain a high level of his motivation. <br><br>  <b>How to do it?</b>  <b>Achiever.ru</b> <br>  We have come to the most interesting - to the specific solution of understandable problems. <br><br>  We are preparing to launch an online resource.  The main process occurring on the site can be reflected in the following scheme: <br>  1) The user chooses a specific goal in one of 4 sections of the site.  The timer starts, and the user must reach the goal before the time runs out.  On its page are published the goals set and achieved. <br>  2) The user automatically joins the group with people who have set the same goal (whether they are fans of parachuting, jogging in the mornings or environmentalists).  There he can receive information from more experienced participants and be inspired by others' successes. <br>  3) The user gets acquainted with the guide created by us, which describes in detail what, how and when to do (I can send an example guide to anyone who wishes or post it if there is interest). <br>  4) The user does what is described in the guide. <br>  5) The user lays out the confirmation that he has achieved the result.  For this, he can use the application we have prepared or another method available to him. <br>  6) The confirmation is checked by the administration;  it rejects or accepts confirmation, after which the user is given an achievement.  Achievement is reflected on his wall, the user gets points on which he can compete with other users in the results. <br><br>  Using different mechanisms, we want to spark competition among users.  They will compete with each other in obtaining real achievements, and at the same time, grow above themselves. <br><br>  We hope the idea is clear.  Before the beta testing remains about two months, during this period we expect to debug the functionality and get ready to meet the first users on our resource.  In the following articles we will describe the technologists used in the development and the problems we encountered in the process. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/203394/">https://habr.com/ru/post/203394/</a></p>
