But, as I already wrote, there is a small minus in these headphones - the top of the head is slightly uncomfortable with long wearing.  Coupled with the fact that his wife also wanted to join the wireless sect, I decided to look after myself for something more convenient, but equally comfortable in terms of sound and price.  For good luck, I turned up the head of IT-department Misha with his Creative WP-350. <br><br>  Misha kindly gave me ‚Äúto drive my ears‚Äù for two weeks, so I put together an idea about them more or less complete (for myself, of course).  Like the HB-401, they have both advantages and disadvantages.  Moreover, if we compare these two models (and I will do just that, since I have the experience of wireless headphones only on them), then the final score will be approximately equal.  So, I'll start ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2d2/962/e15/2d2962e15bb76cde8b757ff26e198f59.jpg" width="500"><br>  <i>Let the battle begin</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      <b>ERGONOMICS AND IMPRESSIONS OF WEARING</b> <br><br>  The first thing to say is that the Creative WP-350 is not just a headset, but a wireless headset, so you can easily not only listen to music on your way to work, but also talk on the phone without getting it out of your pocket.  Lightweight, lightweight design (only 108 grams) with small swivel cups plays into the hands of those who are planning to carry headphones on themselves or ride with them on trips.  In addition, it is quite suitable for Apple-style. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ec8/938/4dc/ec89384dcb776403e8cadaf76ff547d7.jpg" width="400"><br>  <i>(headphones versus iPhone)</i> <br><br>  Unlike HB-401, WP-350 fits perfectly on the neck and allows you to fasten your jacket or sweatshirt to the very end (actual in windy St. Petersburg or in winter).  Also, Creative at the expense of its compact design allows you to wear them under the hood and almost does not constrain movements (when wearing HB-401 under the hood, you have to slightly raise the shoulders, neck uncomfortable). <br><br>  On the other hand, small cups play the role of some irritation factor.  Yes, they are perfectly pressed to the ear, close it almost completely, but the open lobe creates the feeling that something is still missing (and in winter the lobes are also cold).  But the headset itself does not fall off from the head even with moderate running after the trolleybus and the feeling of the socks is quite a pleasant one. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/490/b05/cdb/490b05cdbb31001dcba248c5fa7dffa0.jpg" width="500"><br>  <i>(this is how a person dressed in Creatives looks like. The photo is not mine)</i> <br><br>  Control buttons.  They are very conveniently located on the outer side of the cup: on top - play / pause, on the bottom - answer the call / drop, on the sides - forward / back.  Volume control is located on the bottom of the cup.  For a long time (about a week) I thought that the volume and forward / back were a bit oddly arranged, and even on the left cup (which is confusing, because the control buttons in the HB-401 are on the right), but then I realized that I just wear them upside-down.  Although it became more familiar to manage in the right position, but for the comfort head diminished (I still have an oval head, not every headphone will work). <br><br>  <b>SOUND</b> <br><br>  I liked the microphone more in the HB-401.  It is the same imperceptible, but more clear, or something.  Even with the right wearing of Creatives, the interlocutors heard me worse than when using HB-401. <br><br>  It‚Äôs written on <a href="http://ru.creative.com/p/headphones-headsets/wp-350">the manufacturer‚Äôs website</a> that WP-350 uses aptX technology to produce crystal sound, but I can subjectively say that the only difference I found is that the sound in HB-401 is more rigid, ‚Äúaggressive‚Äù, therefore it seems louder and you can hear it better at the same playback volume.  I would also like to note that Creative in this model still uses overhead cups, which, unlike Harper, isolate the ear from external sounds worse and because of this, in the subway and the plane, the neighbors hear better what you are listening to. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/292/42a/669/29242a669a3c48f5ad58149ec67ee1b3.jpg" width="500"><br>  <i>(but in such headphones, none of the neighbors heard what my film was about)</i> <br><br>  <b>CONNECTION</b> <br><br>  The WP-350 uses the Bluetooth module 2.1 + EDR, the HB-401 uses 4.0, so they are comparable in battery usage.  However, the fourth version of the module allows you to display the battery status in the notification window and the status bar, which the Creative Module cannot boast. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/35a/3a3/eb4/35a3a3eb464e491abfde2c07e1bd1bca.png" height="550"><br>  <i>(very handy thing - to know how much charge is left in the battery)</i> <br><br>  What is in some, that in other headphones, you can call Siri with the button for answering an incoming call - it can be useful for iPhones, especially in the latest models of Apple company phones.  But due to the fact that this button is paired with the on / off button, you should practice before using this function "in the fields", otherwise you can simply turn off the headset or put it into pairing mode. <br><br>  A big plus of the WP-350 in front of the HB-401 is that the last song you listened to is memorized and automatically installed on it when connected: you can simply turn on the headphones, press play and enjoy.  With Harper, when connected and provided that ‚ÄúMusic‚Äù was dropped from active applications, a random song is included. <br><br>  <b>INDICATION AND AUTONOMY</b> <br><br>  In Creativity, a less ‚Äúnuclear‚Äù LED at work, so you can completely listen to music in bed at night and not be afraid to wake up the light of who is near. <br><br>  Notice that the WP-350 is about to run out of battery that is very unobtrusive and soft.  Even at once you do not understand that it will soon be necessary to put them on charge.  The time between the first ‚Äúbipkami‚Äù to full discharge - 10-15 minutes (in HB-401 - 20-30 minutes, you can still listen to music, that is, it should be enough to work). <br><br>  If you compare the autonomy, the WP-350, of course, loses - 8-9 hours against 12. This is most likely due to the less capacious battery.  But the same factor allows them to charge for 1 hour versus 2.5 for HB-401.  So here is 1: 1. <br><br>  <b>FINDINGS</b> <br><br>  For myself, of course, I will not take Creative WP-350, since I fly on business trips from time to time and sometimes I go to work in the subway and in these cases sound insulation is important.  For the train, probably also relevant.  But for everyday wear outdoors and indoors, they are more comfortable than the Harper HB-401.  Yes, and for those who have children, the more flexible handle of the Creatives will come in handy (on my handle it has already cracked, having heroically held on for half a year under periodic torture of a seven-year spin-grill).  Well, metal fans will probably not like the very soft sound of the WP-350.  Although, perhaps, you can somehow adjust them, but I could not find it during the operation.  As for the rest, apart from the price, this pair is about the same - the famous Creatives are now selling at prices starting <a href="https://market.yandex.ru/product/7706480%3Fhid%3D418706%26suggest%3D1">at 3,500</a> , and the less well-known Harpers can be purchased for <a href="https://market.yandex.ru/product--harper-hb-401/12789789">one and a half to two thousand</a> . <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Future plans</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  By the way, I chose headphones that are suitable for the geometry of my head - SONY MDR-ZX330BT.  Soon I will try them out. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/372/72a/497/37272a497ee3766db427dcf8f82f9080.png"></div></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/368601/">https://habr.com/ru/post/368601/</a></p>
