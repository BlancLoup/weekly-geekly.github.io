We finished repairs, conducted two start-up schools in a row at once and organized the grand opening of our center. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6f2/b6b/a4a/6f2b6ba4ad1945608dd42d05d4272368.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In full compliance with the 80/20 rule, 20% of the improvements gave 80% of the site impressions, but they also required - well, if not 80% of the effort and time, then definitely not less than 60%.  For example, noise insulation foam on the ceiling and walls has dramatically improved the acoustics of our rooms and gave the interior a new look.  Curtains began to create the necessary twilight for presentations on the projector.  The signboard made our building more visible.  The crushed stone in the territory allowed to place on the street several recreation areas and smoking areas.  All this was not 2 weeks ago.

    <h2>  We built, built ... </h2><br><br>  Despite the minor difficulties, we did not pull and began to host major events.  The first was the <a href="http://blog.sloboda.it/%3Fp%3D77">startup school "Sprint"</a> , which was organized by IIDF.  For two days, September 19-20, theoretical and practical classes were held on our site for those who want to start their own business on the Internet or find an idea for a project. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3fe/437/422/3fe437422f9c4fd7a62cf6e333bb4ba8.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cc3/ee5/342/cc3ee534232842ee89a7a25ed469bc98.jpg"><br><br>  Two weeks later, on October 3-5, we received participants from another school: the <a href="http://sloboda.timepad.ru/event/143210/">IT schools of the Crimean Federal District</a> .  It was intended for those who want to run their IT business, and represented three days of practical training and group work.  The participants discussed a variety of topics, from the most basic (how the innovation ecosystem of Russia is organized) to more specific (how to look for and evaluate business ideas, what a ‚Äúfrugal startup‚Äù is and how to conduct an effective presentation). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e4f/efc/8e5/e4fefc8e5cc9411fae0cb2e38e0d5dc4.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3ad/0e2/1dd/3ad0e21ddf5e46009e45554448d8b4a6.jpg"><br><br>  To this school, we timed the long-awaited event - the grand opening of the Sloboda.  But we will not write about him, because everything has already been written <a href="http://sloboda.it/open-report">here</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d96/bdd/599/d96bdd599f294b7a9a868b9de71241b7.jpg"><br><br><h2>  ... and finally built </h2><br><br>  The venue we have got together combines coworking, a conference area and office space. <br><br>  Coworking is designed for 70 residents who are provided with jobs and all the necessary infrastructure.  All residents have unlimited access to <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/w5i93446tbzfzfl/AAC-IyE6m5uaRabdH8dUaT_Xa%3Fdl%3D0">high-speed Internet</a> , personal workspace (fixed or floating, depending on the tariff), the right to use office equipment.  Plus, they can attend most events for free, use the kitchen (there is always tea, coffee, water, fruit and cookies), a library, car parking and bicycle parking.  For an additional fee, we will provide a meeting room and organize an event. <br><br>  The conference area is two rooms, large and small, which we rent for a variety of events.  Of course, as a center for technology entrepreneurship, we are more inclined to host technology and business conferences, master classes, schools, and other business and educational events.  But not only: we will be happy to host the events of any other directions.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãa large 107m2, depending on the format of the event, can accommodate up to 150 people;  small - 42.5 m2, it can fit up to 40 people.  The halls are equipped with everything you need: a projector, blackboards, lots of chairs, Wi-Fi and sockets, and a large hall - microphones.  By additional agreement, we will help with the placement of participants in the event, catering, additional equipment, stationery and even blankets. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d83/283/80f/d8328380f77e43759e10443fda0fa355.jpg"><br><br>  Office space is 3 offices on the second floor of our building, which can be removed entirely and put a start-up team or a local office / department of a large company there.  Thus, you will not have to look for a room on your own, the office will be cheaper than a regular office, and we will take over the entire infrastructure.  In addition, with the necessary isolation and privacy you are at the same time remaining in the thick of things and can take part in our events. <br><br><h2>  Hooray! </h2><br><br>  Now that the discovery has taken place, the symbol of the fact that everything is completely ready, a new stage begins: systematic daily work.  Here we have big plans, and our colleagues and excellent specialists will help us in their implementation - four people led by Pavel Berman, who made the St. Petersburg ‚ÄúZone of Action‚Äù.  In the coming days, they will fly to us from St. Petersburg and will work with us to make the Sloboda the first option next year when searching for co-working or an office in the Crimea. <br><br>  What we plan to do: <br><ul><li>  launch special subscriptions for permanent residents, which will combine a pass for entering the Sloboda building and a discount or bonus of various institutions of Sevastopol </li><li>  hold stationary phones and provide them with everyone </li><li>  start providing residents with private advice on any issues or help in finding experts for advice </li><li>  arrange for residents to enjoy preferential or free attendance at events at partner sites </li><li>  organize a support system for non-resident residents: assistance with relocation, renewal of legal entities, etc. </li><li>  start forming an educational program </li></ul><br><br>  Now we are processing the tariff scale and will soon publish a new one on the website and in social networks.  Our task is to use all available methods and tools to create a large-scale IT center capable of providing any conceivable services to freelancers, startups and IT companies. <br><br>  And, as always, see you in Sloboda! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/361781/">https://habr.com/ru/post/361781/</a></p>
