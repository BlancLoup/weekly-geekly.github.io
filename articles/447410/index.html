  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Provincial fire or the birth of a nation</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  <strong>Prologue</strong> </p><br><p>  Call the fire brigade!  Only they can put out the fire under his ass. </p><br><p>  <strong>Year 1996</strong> </p><br><p>  America celebrates independence day.  In honor of this, Will Smith saves the planet from alien attack with a computer virus.  I save the planet by coordinating fighters equipped with laser guns.  Alas, salvation is not in the film, but in the game UFO: Enemy Unknown.  At this point, I understand that I want to work in IT.  But not because of the interest in the device of a laser gun or the coolness of computer viruses.  All because of another computer game - Leisure Suit Larry.  In the same game there are cartoons and tits!  What else do you need for normal maturing of a boy?  Only one thing - so that Mom would not find the game.  And that would not have found it - it must be hidden.  So I found out what MS-DOS and Windows are. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  <strong>Year 1999</strong> </p><br><p>  The Wachowski brothers talked about the matrix, and Bomfunk MC's recorded the single Freestyler.  The floor of the city walks in dark glasses singing "Maca pho cancer" and hoping to escape from the matrix.  I did not want to get out of the matrix.  I wanted to organize the computer network in the neighboring house and understand how the IPX / SPX magic letters differ from TCP / IP.  So I learned Linux and network stack. </p><br><p>  <strong>Year 2004</strong> </p><br><p>  Will Smith again saves humanity, but about the robots.  I go to the Institute for electricity.  There are no robots, no computer networks in the power industry, and certainly no boobs.  Motivation at zero.  I am not a robot, I have dreams.  Deduction.  So I found out how easy it is to disappoint a family. </p><br><p>  <strong>Year 2005</strong> </p><br><p>  They lied to us!  Bruce Wayne is not a millionaire and Batman.  Batman is Christian Bale.  Solved.  I will become the Batman for the IT of our city.  I will help everyone who lights the bat-signal in the form of a "blue screen of death."  So I learned about outsourcing. </p><br><p>  <strong>Year 2007</strong> </p><br><p>  Optimus Prime and Megatron landed on the ground.  The planet is in danger!  Where is this damn Will Smith?  Who will save humanity from extinction?  Well, certainly not me.  How can you go save the world when you have a real Cisco switch in your hands, and right next to a box is a real HP server?  So I learned about career advancement. </p><br><p>  <strong>Year 2009</strong> </p><br><p>  The Internet is full of jokes about blue giants.  Many male individuals are tracked in the club of females in order to attach their workshop.  But I do not care.  I'm an engineer now.  So I found out that my family dreamed that I would become an engineer.  After all, they grew up in the USSR, and in the Soviet Union the word engineer sounded proudly. </p><br><p>  <strong>Year 2011</strong> </p><br><p>  The first time interview is immediately with the director of IT.  It is rumored that at first there was only he and his great program, and then around it all a business appeared.  Here I would now tablet NZT, to know all areas of darkness and it will not be scary.  And here we met - two ordinary people with the same set of limbs.  The first question is whether I know C + <br>  +?  My first question is what is their RTO?  The answers of both are like the mooing of cows.  I accepted.  But why is everything simple?  Soon I understand - any cant it = my cant.  It does not matter that the programmers updated the back-end from their laptop via wifi.  The programmer can not be mistaken, but the program is perfect.  This is all stupid admin, he does not understand anything in this life.  The admin process (well, those that are from the shoulders) needed to grow in the pelvic region.  So I learned what is gray. </p><br><p>  <strong>Year 2013</strong> </p><br><p>  This is all due to the fact that I am in a commercial trading business.  Here in serious offices all respect each other.  And what could be more serious Banks?  Only not banks on Wall Street (there are many wolves), but local small banks.  And now I go in a suit.  I am addressed to you.  My opinion is listened to, but why is it so boring?  A lot of bureaucracy, no change, no innovation.  Choking.  So I found out about burnout. </p><br><p>  <strong>Year 2014</strong> </p><br><p>  The edge of the future is blurred.  I drink tea half a day, I look for another job for half a day.  Bingo!  It is also a bank, but federal and with steep tasks to merge branches.  Pass an interview and get an offer.  From the very first week, the project work has started.  Checkmate routine!  Strong involvement makes itself felt - almost live at work (the difference from MSC + 7).  Projects are completed, and the reward letter is about reducing my bid.  So I found out how a girl feels when you part with her by SMS. </p><br><p>  <strong>Year 2015</strong> </p><br><p>  Broken and depressed.  Again in retail.  There is no team, every man for himself.  The head can not distinguish the flash drive from sfp.  Accident after the accident.  I take everything in my hands.  A lot of informal communication with the team, a lot of exchange of experience.  The game is simulated timlid won.  I am a new infrastructure manager.  Well, now I will teach everyone to live and revenge everyone.  And harmful marketers that the layouts for the website cannot do, and programmers who like to optimize their code with the phrase ‚Äúyou need to add a server and memory and SSD disks‚Äù, and accountants with their clumsy accounting IT assets in 1C.  My ardor was quickly cooled by a call to the director of IT.  My hemispheres have not had such passionate sex yet.  I learned a lot of new things, and that the marketers did great work - they earn money, and that programmers are the lights of our company and the director himself is a former programmer (deja vu something), and that very clever people work in accounting, and this is clumsy accounting That I can not organize this account. </p><br><p>  Okay.  Challenge accepted.  Wardrobe change.  Change the library.  Getting a red profile diploma of higher education.  More conferences and meetings - less communication with the team.  More coaching and counseling - less technical hands-on work.  The team is united and trained.  All projects and objects delivered on time.  So I became a manager. </p><br><p>  <strong>Year 2018</strong> </p><br><p>  My vein is hungry.  He can build data centers in fields where nobody except gophers.  He wants to plunge into digital transformation.  It requires digital for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  So I went to St. Petersburg. </p><br><p>  <strong>Year 1915</strong> </p><br><p>  D. U. Griffith rolls the film "The Birth of a Nation".  Many in the course of watching the movie left the hall.  The film is so impressive to the public that the protests of both the "black" and the "white" population begin. </p><br><p>  So after my move I have very strong impressions, but I cannot leave the hall. <br>  Why can not leave the hall?  Because I am so self-confident in my abilities that I sold everything in the past city, took a mortgage and bought a house in St. Petersburg.  And I'm self-confident until now. </p><br><p>  I haven't been able to find a job for 5 months already </p><br><p>  The flame of the fire appeared at the time of the search - here we need some programmers. </p><br><p>  I passed several interviews (both technical and managerial) and everywhere were interested in my programming skills.  When I asked why the head of the department responsible for the data center to know 1C programming or GO, they looked at me through the eyes of an owl. </p><br><p> After this interview, the fire allowed me to cook bacon and eggs on it. </p><br><p>  I will not focus on HR in general.  Maybe I'll ever decide on another article, and it will be dedicated to HR.  Now about the other.  Here I submitted my CV in November, in January I was invited.  Good interview.  Position "playing-trainer".  Fidbeck that I liked, but more candidates will look until the end of January.  Extended until the end of February.  Now until the end of March. </p><br><p>  I am writing to a friend.  Please send his CV to this company.  For a week, he went through an interview, got an offer and an achive "I'm a cool dude."  Guess who he is?  Programmer. <br>  Turned off the heating - the whole family is heated by the fire. </p><br><p>  For me, the presence of the requirement of a spoken English language has become a distinctive feature of western vacancies.  And it does not matter what kind of company and profession.  I can not understand this tribute to fashion or necessity?  Decided to check.  Made a "fake" cv technician.  Sent to similar companies.  I pass a telephone interview, comes to the conversation in English, and I honestly admit that the level is bad.  The result is a failure.  Making a "fake" cv programmer.  We send it to those companies where they sent linden to the technician.  Results - we get more resume.  The lack of spoken English confuses little. <br>  We live with our neighbors - a fire has burnt a hole in the ceiling. </p><br><p>  It seems I'm on the right track.  This is already 4 interviews and it is with the owners.  Before that, the financial and personnel directors were covered, as well as a conversation with the former colonel of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (oh why am I the one - there are no ex).  We talked for 3 hours, discussed everything from spacecraft to staff reduction.  Already on you.  And then this phrase "What about programming?" <br>  Here it is my court Lynch.  I never got a call back. </p><br><p>  The energy of the fire is enough for heating the whole house and underground parking. </p><br><p>  At what point was the birth of the nation?  Nation programmers.  I thought, and I still think so, that in the city where I grew up, programmers are more valuable, since there was nothing at all.  But it was before, and now got into the Internet and found a solution to any problem.  Now a piece of code to compile or OS to put any monkey can.  And before giving up this monkey to me, think about what I took the simplest examples.  Not every monkey will write an application or a suitable program and not every monkey will build you a normal infrastructure for the back-end of this program / application.  These tasks can only be done by experienced primates. </p><br><p>  So far, the pattern breaks.  Why should a manager or an engineer program.  No, well, if you are a programmer or DevOps in an IT startup, then of course you need to.  And if you are a pure integrator, why do you need Kung Fu? </p><br><p>  There is not one article about how someone quit programming and became the ‚Äúmaster of the machines.‚Äù <br>  There is not a single course on how to become a cisco engineer.  All podcasts for developers.  I instagram offered to become a blockchain programmer in 5 days.  Come on!  The world was created in 7 days, and you can become a programmer in 5. What? </p><br><p>  Soc.  polls about employers are only developers. </p><br><p>  Hundreds of articles about how to teach a child to program and not one how to make a child an engineer.  But in the Soviet Union the word engineer sounded proud ... </p><br><p>  <strong>Epilogue</strong> </p><br><p>  Year 2019. The Wachowski brothers became sisters.  Removed remake Freestyler.  The fire brigade never arrived.  Outside the window, the snow is melting either from spring, or from the fire under his ass. </p><br><p>  <strong>Acknowledgments</strong> </p><br><pre><code class="plaintext hljs">@LucBertrand @gapel @nmivan</code> </pre> <br><p>  This will sound strange, but your articles have become the catalyst for the publication of this article. </p></div>
