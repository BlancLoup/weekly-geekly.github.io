  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What tasks can be solved using the corporate portal</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Launching a corporate portal in my company, I thought about which of its features are interesting to me.  Indeed, if we describe everything that modern portals can, there is not enough room for the great Chinese.  On the other hand, we all know that the majority of employees use only 15-20% of these opportunities. <br>  How to focus on those features of portals that cover the needs of most users?  Obviously, the requirements of the HR manager and the IT director when working with the system will differ dramatically.  Therefore, I identified several user groups, described the most typical needs for them, and, based on this, I chose the appropriate solution. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Immediately make a reservation, the issues of cost of ownership of the portal, the duration of the project implementation and resiliency of the system are beyond the scope of this article.  I will try to describe them in the following posts in the near future. <br>  Based on the principles of working with the portal, I identified the following user groups: <br><ul><li>  ordinary users; </li><li>  HR managers; </li><li>  communications and communications managers; </li><li>  IT professionals; </li><li>  top managers, heads of departments. </li></ul><br>  Now we will describe the key needs for each of the selected groups (if the need is typical for several groups, for example, a quick search for information, it will be described in the first of these groups): <br><ul><li>  Normal users have the following needs: <br><ul><li>  quick search of the required information (document templates, work instructions, regulations and TST, documents for tenders, etc.); </li><li>  automation of routine operations (order of business cards, order of the office, applications for staff recruitment, reservation of meeting rooms, etc.); </li><li>  sharing information with each other (messages, vacation photos, photos of the new car, discussion of news and events, etc.); </li><li>  information on the receipt / availability of books and / or periodicals in the company's library, access to electronic versions of books and / or periodicals (news on admission, catalog of books and journals, how many copies there are, short description, user comments). </li></ul><br></li><li>  Personnel managers have the following needs: <br><ul><li>  polls and questionnaires of company employees (convenient mechanism for preparing questionnaires and questionnaires, automatic distribution to a selected group of users, a simple mechanism for filling in questionnaires and questionnaires, preliminary processing of results); </li><li>  archive of organizational and legal documents (job descriptions, department regulations, organizational chart); </li><li>  awareness and / or adaptation of new employees (electronic tour of the company, a list of social facilities: a museum, a canteen or where you can have dinner, a medical unit, a trade union where it is, a mode of operation, sample applications. On what issues to whom to contact, for example, what to do, if you forgot the pass? and others.); </li><li>  number dynamics (visualization facilities for employed and dismissed employees by age, profession, department, etc.); </li><li>  Photo of the working day (a convenient mechanism for filling the directory of functions by professions / positions, a simple mechanism for filling a photo of the working day, the possibility of rationing functions, preliminary processing of results) </li></ul><br></li><li>  Communication and communication managers have the following needs: <br><ul><li>  informing employees of the company (about events in which the company participates, about new types of products and services - orientation of all employees of the company to the final result); </li><li>  assessment of intra-corporate attitudes (collection and processing of the opinion of company employees on social conditions, food quality, personnel changes, etc.); </li><li>  internal marketing campaigns (collection and processing of the opinion of company employees on new manufactured goods and services, etc.); </li><li>  collection of information about the hobbies of employees of the company (internal values, motivation). </li></ul><br></li><li>  IT professionals have the following needs: <br><ul><li>  a convenient mechanism for processing requests for technical support (the principle of one window, integration with existing helpdesk systems - if they exist, informing users about changes in the status of an application, statistical processing of results); </li><li>  convenient address book with the ability to quickly search for the full name, position, phone and location of any user (including display on the map); </li><li>  analysis and display of statistics on the number of calls to the support service, Internet traffic, telephone communication and printing. </li><li>  organization of a single point of access to all information systems of the company; </li><li>  output from CCTV cameras. </li></ul><br></li><li>  For managers and top managers, the following needs are characteristic: <br><ul><li>  information analysis (preliminary processing and visualization of any available information - financial indicators, commercial information, the number of failures and accidents at work, staff turnover, etc.); </li><li>  feedback from the company's employees (the opportunity to find out the opinion of the company's employees on any issue directly); </li></ul><br></li></ul><br>  And in order that the needs were not contrived by me, I selected experts from each group and asked them to offer their options. <br>  This procedure is useful to do to all who face the choice of a corporate portal.  Thus, we close several questions at once: we identify the main customers / consumers of the portal in our company, find allies in the implementation, form the implementation team and involve them into the project from the zero stage, clearly formulate the basic needs and when choosing a supplier, we ask to show how the identified tasks implemented in his proposed solution. <br>  PS User groups and needs may vary for each company. <br>  PPS I would be grateful if someone else will share the needs and tasks solved with the help of a corporate portal. </div>
