Today, March 25, a solemn ceremony will be held to lay the foundation stone of a promising accelerator complex, timed to the beginning of the construction of the Russian collider NICA in Dubna near Moscow.  According to the plans, the first launch of the collider is planned in early 2019.  We will describe the project of Russian physicists, its main tasks, research directions and the current state of affairs at the facility in our today's publication. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7a6/9f0/c47/7a69f0c47d2b833a4702e5b90a545f25.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The work on the creation of the younger brother of the LHC of the first Russian collider NICA (Nuclotron-based Ion Collider facility) at the Institute for Nuclear Research (Dubna) began in 2013.  The global goal of the project is to simulate the moment when the Universe appeared and to study the properties of dense baryonic matter.  According to the director of the High Energy Laboratory of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) Vladimir Kekelidze, the project is divided into several stages.  According to the plans, the collider will be launched in 2019 and will develop its full capacity after 3 years, after which it will enter the normal operating mode and be ready for planned use.  The first stage in the project implementation - the construction of the BM @ N detector will be completed in 2017.  The completion of the final, third stage - the construction of the SPD detector, in accordance with the current plans and capabilities of JINR, is scheduled for 2023. <br><br>  Despite the significant difference in size and budgets (at the initial stages, funding was provided by JINR), NIKA, also implemented in international cooperation, faces no less ambitious tasks than the CERN facility.  The main difference between the Russian NICA complex and the Swiss one for the initial purposes of experiments.  If CERN was created mainly to search for the elusive Higgs boson - a particle that imparts mass to all other particles, then NIKA will allow studying aspects of the Universe origin a few billion years ago and, above all, the process of forming baryonic matter from gluons and quarks the early stages of the evolution of the universe and in the depths of neutron stars.

      NICA will make it possible to study the interactions of beams of various particles: from protons and polarized deuterons to massive gold ions.  Heavy ions are planned to be accelerated to energies of 4.5 GeV, protons - up to 12.6 GeV.  A collider is being created on the basis of the upgraded Nuclotron accelerator operating at JINR since 1993.  The registration of the parameters of collisions of particle fluxes will be carried out at two points. <br><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">Plans and prospects</font> </h2><br>  The NIKA project does not involve the digging of tunnels and mines, since the installation, which is a cascade of three accelerators, was developed taking into account the capacities of the already existing superconducting ion synchrotron-Nuclotron.  The intensity required for the experiments with particles will be provided by a ‚Äúbooster‚Äù using existing synchrophasotron magnets.  And to accelerate the protons to the desired energy will allow two rings of the collider with a diameter of 500 m. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cde/dd3/06e/cdedd306e144571e4cc2dd5d33817acb.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i><sub>Superconducting accelerator complex NICA</sub></i> <br><br>  ‚ÄúThere is also a field of high-energy physics, no less interesting and very popular today.  And in this area we expect very bright interesting discoveries.  One of them is the phase transition of nuclear matter.  In order to study phenomena of this order, it is necessary to create the maximum density of baryonic matter, the one that exists in neutron stars.  The study of these processes does not require energies of such magnitude as those used in the LHC or Brookhaven machine.  In theory, the energy required for our experiments is very close to that which is already achievable at our Nuclotron, ‚Äùexplained the director of the JINR High Energy Laboratory, Vladimir Kekelidze. <br><br>  Scientists hope that NICA will be able to create better conditions for experiments with heavy ions, which will allow moving the world research center in this segment of physics to the Moscow region. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/56e/3ef/0cc/56e3ef0ccc5a5e3007f163d5d602d5b1.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i><sub>Nuclotron (The first superconducting synchrotron of heavy ions)</sub></i> <br><br>  ‚ÄúTheorists formulated the conditions under which it became possible to develop the Universe along the way it went.  And the conditions are very simple - a certain temperature (or energy) of particles and the density of nuclear matter.  When the criteria and boundary parameters were identified, it became clear which experiment should be performed under laboratory conditions on Earth to simulate the conditions that were in the early stages of the Universe formation, ‚Äùexplains JINR Deputy Chief Engineer, Corresponding Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences Grigori Trubnikov. <br><br>  In accordance with the hypotheses of scientists, NIKA will allow to simulate conditions close to those that accompanied the ‚ÄúBig Bang‚Äù which, according to one of the considered versions, caused the appearance of our Universe.  ‚ÄúTo solve our tasks, we need a well-defined energy, to which we need to accelerate heavy nuclei.  For this purpose we chose ‚Äúgold by gold‚Äù, which is technologically easier.  The fact that the collider is created on the basis of the existing and operating Nuclotron speeds up and simplifies the process of project implementation.  The capabilities of NICA will allow us to conduct research in two directions: to study the heavy ion program, to try to achieve that maximum density of baryonic matter and see what happens and, at the same time, to study a no less interesting direction - spin physics, ‚ÄùKekelidze explained. <br><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">BM @ N experiment to study baryonic matter at the Nuclotron</font> </h2><br>  Collisions of high-energy heavy ions provide unique opportunities to study the properties of nuclear matter under extreme conditions.  One of the main problems in modern astrophysics is the description of the mechanisms of formation and stability of neutron stars, as well as the processes occurring in supernova explosions.  In this case, the equation of state of superdense nuclear matter can be obtained only on the basis of experimental data on nucleus-nucleus collisions. <br><br>  One of the most intriguing is the prediction about the partial restoration of chiral symmetry in dense nuclear matter observed from significant changes in the properties of hadrons (masses and lifetimes) under the influence of nuclear density.  However, the lack of accurate experimental data for collision energies of the order of several GeV per nucleon currently makes it difficult to choose in favor of any one of the proposed modification scenarios.  When relativistic nuclei collide, a large number of particles with strangeness (K-mesons and Œõ-hyperons) are born.  In the process of secondary interaction of these particles with nucleons of the medium, multiple formation of cascade hyperons and hypernuclei is possible.  The study of the production of hypernuclei will clarify the important properties of the hyperon-nucleon and hyperon-hyperon interaction potential in the medium.  Moreover, the planned studies have significant potential for discovery, since the data on double hypernuclei today are presented very sparingly. <br><br>  The program on the physics of heavy ions at the Nuclotron involves the development of the following areas of research: the study of the equation of state of nuclear matter and the dynamics of nuclear collisions, the study of the properties of hadrons in a dense medium, the study of the production of cascade hyperons near the threshold and the birth of hypernuclei. <br><br>  A significant proportion of the collected statistics will be the p + p, p + n (d) reactions that will be required to normalize the data on A + A collisions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c09/e4d/8e4/c09e4d8e430d4691aff47fcd08a302c2.png"><br>  <i><sub>Fig.</sub></i>  <i><sub>1. Scheme of the experiment BM @ N</sub></i> <br><br>  The experiments will allow scientists to investigate the distribution of hadrons in speed, azimuth angle, transverse momentum, to study the fluctuations and correlations of hadrons in the event.  In Fig.  2 (see below) shows the experimental setup.  The BM @ N detector is represented by a track system, a time-of-flight system for identifying charged particles, and detectors for determining collision parameters.  The track system consists of a set of GEM (Gaseous Electron Multipliers) detectors located inside the analyzing magnet (max. Field of 0.8 T), as well as Cathode Pad (CPC) and drift (DCH) cameras behind the magnet.  Time-of-flight detectors (TOF1,2) based on multigap Resistive Plate Chambers mRPC technology with strip readout are intended for efficient particle separation.  The parameters of such detectors make it possible to identify particles up to pulses of the order of several GeV / c.  The zero-angle calorimeter (ZDC) is designed to determine the impact parameter of the collision (centrality) by measuring the energy of the particle fragments of the beam.  It is also planned to restore the centrality of the interaction independently by measuring the energy of the target particle fragments in the recoil detector (Recoil), which partially overlaps the rear hemisphere (-1 &lt;Œ∑ &lt;1.2). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fb3/2f2/f79/fb32f2f79163467d86abe9c9b0ed006b.png"><br>  <i><sub>Fig.</sub></i>  <i><sub>2. GEM-detector module on the test beam of the Nuclotron</sub></i> <br><br>  It should be noted that GEM detectors for the BM @ N experiment are created by the JINR group using the CERN design.  An experimental sample of a GEM detector has already passed the test control during a session on the proton beam of the Nuclotron in February 2014.  (Fig. 2) and in all tests confirmed the operational stability and efficiency of registration. <br><br>  The characteristics of BM @ N for reconstructing hyperons using track information from the GEM detector are shown in Fig.  3. The quality of identification of Œõ-hyperons by the invariant mass remains high even in events with a high particle multiplicity (in so-called central Au + Au interactions). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/508/63e/e38/50863ee384fd4fd9af7080904a26c586.png"><br>  <i><sub>Fig.</sub></i>  <i><sub>3. Distribution by invariant mass for pairs of protons and œÄ-mesons reconstructed in central Au + Au collisions at 4.5 GeV / nucleon.</sub></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ed9/5f1/0f9/ed95f10f9921b408308a36dedef441c6.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i><sub>Hilac.</sub></i>  <i><sub>Heavy Ion Accelerator</sub></i> <br><br>  NIKA, according to scientists, will help reveal the structure of the Universe and the principles underlying its fundamental forces and phenomena: black holes, dark matter, dark energy, wormholes, extra dimensions. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWhen you know how substance was formed, how matter was formed, how it was formed, you can predict what will happen to this matter, how it will develop further, how it will disintegrate and, finally, how to die.  In general, these are the fundamental questions that will provide the key to understanding the evolution of our Universe, ‚ÄùGrigory Trubnikov shares his opinion. <br><br>  The parameters of the created installation will allow to achieve ultra-high density of matter, high energy, explore the behavior of many different particles, which opens up unprecedented opportunities for solving a number of applied problems.  With new knowledge, carbon therapy will be replenished, it will be possible to study the processes of transmutation of radioactive waste and new approaches to energy production. <br><br>  According to Kekelidze, the NICA project will be implemented using the most advanced technologies and materials, which will provide the Russian accelerator with an advantage in obtaining information on particle collisions 100‚Äì1000 times compared to its predecessor and main competitor, the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/RHIC">RHIC</a> accelerator in American Brookhaven. <br><br>  ‚ÄúInitially, scientists plan to push together not only ions, but also ions and protons, other elementary particles and light nuclei.  This will allow to accumulate primary data, determine starting points and understand where and how to move on.  Such studies attract the attention of not only nuclear physicists, but also theorists who study how the Universe originated and those processes that occur in the depths of superdense matter clots - neutron stars and other degenerate objects of the cosmos ‚Äù, the physicist is convinced. <br><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">Current situation</font> </h2><br>  Leading international experts take part in the NICA project implemented at the JINR base.  And it is very important that the project will be in Russia, and not abroad, and will create unique opportunities for the development of domestic scientific potential, jobs with brilliant prospects for the development of generations of Russian physicists. <br><br>  Kevelidze noted that the NIKA project is being implemented in full accordance with the schedule.  The events of the last 3 years related to the political situation had practically no effect on the project, which was initially implemented, in addition to Russian scientists, experts from Belarus, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Bulgaria and Germany.  In total, the list of participating countries now includes 24 countries, the current cost of the project, according to Kekelidze, is estimated at $ 545 million. <br><br>  To some extent, the ways to overcome the problems associated with the events in Ukraine have become complicated, and, above all, the logistics schemes have become more complicated.  However, Ukraine remains an active participant in the project, although some problems with contributions are expected, according to Kevelidze.  So most recently, the plant in Kramatorsk - he added, put some of the necessary equipment.  85-90% of the scientific community of Ukraine, distanced itself from current events and continues to maintain ties with Russian colleagues.  Practically, JINR didn‚Äôt feel Western sanctions, the embargoes that were adopted in the 50s of the last century at the stage of the Cold War are considerably more pressing.  At the same time, there are ways and means of circumventing them - ‚Äúrenting‚Äù finished products instead of buying raw materials, etc. According to Kekelidze, their European colleagues are actively interested in finding such ways. <br><br>  In 2016, the start of the physical data set in the BM @ N experiment is scheduled.  Active work continues on the creation of detector elements, the modernization of the beam channel, and the optimization of the installation parameters using Monte-Carlo simulation methods. <br><br>  Quick Reference: <br><br>  The Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (Dubna, Russia) was founded in 1956 on the basis of the Institute for Nuclear Problems of the USSR Academy of Sciences.  It was in Dubna that the first proton accelerator in the world, the synchrophasotron, was created.  The institute has 7 laboratories.  The main areas of research are elementary particle physics, nuclear physics, condensed matter state. <br><br>  <i><sub><a href="http://nica.jinr.ru/">Project website</a></sub></i> <br><br>  Literature: <br><br>  1.
