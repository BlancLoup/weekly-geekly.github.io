And as a result, those who are obsessed with science fiction have every chance to bring the future closer.  For example, those who watched Star Trek in the 60s - later worked at NASA, and those who are involved in robotics in no small part came to it thanks to Azimov. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a73/58a/706/a7358a706824fb57176e7a36e695c7cb.jpg"><br><br>  My fellow members and I wanted to contribute to this process.  And therefore, at the weekend, in the framework of the international convention of fans of fiction Starcon, for the second time, the small but very intensive conference Parsec 2014 will be held.

It was the sixth and last landing of people on another heavenly body.  For many years, mankind has lost interest in such flights.  And after 42 years there are no approved programs for the study and exploration of the moon by man.  NASA is preparing to fly to Mars for the 2030th year, Roskosmos is planning automatic missions to the Moon, which are not the first time moving to the right.  China, although it claims of a future colony on the moon, has not yet presented its plan for landing a man on our satellite.  But at this time groups of enthusiasts, both in the USA and in Russia, became more active.  One of the participants of the Russian team "Luna seven", Alexander Khokhlov, will tell about the perspective plan for creating the first inhabited lunar base by the mid-20s of our century. <br><br>  <i>Alexander already has three reports.</i>  <i>He also tells about errors in the film Gravity and how to become an astronaut</i> <br><br>  <b>The history of the construction of the ISS and the prospects for the existence of space stations.</b>  <b>Yemelyanov Andrey</b> <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/8FwLyemP9HY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgiUzPelpFTZnxW6RbR00x_eRbjRg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  How was the international space station built?

Alexander Svetlov, a specialist in astronomical technology, a member of the National Committee for the preparation and conduct of the World Astronomy Year, will tell you how to organize your astronomical observations. <br><br>  <b>Cosmic dreams - reality or utopia?</b>  <b>Anastasia Stepanova (Mars One participant)</b> <br>  What caused apathy in the generation of the 21st century and what should be done in order not to live your life for nothing?  Who is the hero of our time?  How can a person with an ordinary profession become one of 700 candidates for participation in a flight to Mars?  The participant of the Mars One project Anastasia Stepanova will tell you about an extraordinary way to make your dreams come true.  Mars One is a private project that is going to make future astronauts from ordinary people who are ready to fly to Mars by 2024 and live there. <br><br>  <b>Starships - a new space strategy.</b>  <b>Anton Pervushin</b> <br>  The world piloted astronautics is in crisis.  The shutdown of the space shuttle space shuttle flight program hit the plans for expanding the human presence in the solar system.  The International Space Station is supported by the obsolete Soyuz and Progress spacecraft.  The Chinese rocket and space industry has not yet been able to prove its effectiveness.  But perhaps the main problem is the lack of a magnificent goal.  The voices of those who believe that mankind in space has nothing to do, sound louder and more convincingly, and it is better to spend resources on solving more mundane tasks.  What can the supporters of space expansion say to this harmonious chorus? <br><br><h5>  Useful information: </h5><br><br>  The conference is held on July 12 and 13 within the framework of the science fiction lovers festival Starcon, St. Petersburg, Lenexpo, Pavilion 7. <br>  Entrance to the conference is free for participants of the festival. <br><br>  Minimalistic conference site <a href="http://parsec.lektorium.tv/Shedule/">Parsec</a> <br>  <a href="http://starcon.pro/">Starcon's</a> beautiful <a href="http://starcon.pro/">website</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.lektorium.tv/conference/23306">Records of last year‚Äôs conference</a> <br><br>  Official organizers: educational project <a href="http://www.lektorium.tv/">Lectorium</a> and alumni community <a href="http://239.ru/">239</a> . <br><br>  PS Most of the staff of Lectorium makes a stand on the "Secret of the Third Planet."
