  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Change from Growl to Notification Center</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h5>  Introduction </h5><br>  With the release of MacOSX 10.8, the Notification Center, also known as the Notification Center, was introduced to the public.  As soon as you receive a new mail or, for example, the download to Safari ends, you will see a pop-up window in the upper right corner with a notification informing you about it.  Also on the svaypu with two fingers to the left (or on the hotkey), you can bare the notification panel, which is almost identical to the one in iOS. <br><br><h5>  Problem </h5><br>  Everything would be fine, but there is only one thing: since 2004, all applications use Growl for the purpose of notifying the user and are not in a hurry to switch to a new system.  In particular, Skype, Adium, Transmission and many many other applications for everyday use. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Decision? </h5><br>  <a href="http://collect3.com.au/hiss/">Hiss</a> is one of the very first solutions that appeared on the web.  And the last.  Hiss catches notifications instead of a growl and sends them <b>on his behalf</b> to the Notification Center, with the result that the result is not the most pleasant picture: <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7f2/ec4/d3b/7f2ec4d3b522455d200626314c341fa1.png" alt="image"><br>  As can be seen in the screenshot, the result does not look like the expected one.  Also, there are no individual settings for applications.  The option is working, but not convenient. <br><br><h5>  Better solution </h5><br>  This summer I decided to rectify the situation and, not finding any solutions to the problem on the Internet, apart from promises to release growl2, I began writing CentralNotifier.

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

      <br>
    <h6>  What is it? </h6><br>  Central Notifier is a small application that is injected using a <a href="http://www.culater.net/software/SIMBL/SIMBL.php">SIMBL</a> into everything that moves in the system (like a <a href="http://chpwn.com/apps/maximizer.html">maximizer</a> that adds lion's fullscreen to all applications that it is possible to).  If the application supports growl, then after injection all notifications intended for growl will be sent to the Notification Center.  As a result, we have just such a picture: <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ad0/a18/11b/ad0a1811b9a9c1c120c37387b416d6e8.png" alt="image"><br>  As well as settings for applications: <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2a7/073/a0e/2a7073a0ecf902182e00cc6126febc23.png" alt="image"><br><br><h6>  And what's the catch? </h6><br>  Work it works, but is at an early stage of development.  I no longer have time to do this project, and I got accustomed to the current bugs.  I have been working without complaints for a month already, I decided to share it with the public and I will be very happy if someone takes the project under his wing. <br><br><h6>  Installation </h6><br>  1) Install <a href="http://www.culater.net/software/SIMBL/SIMBL.php">SIMBL</a> <br>  2) Download and unpack <a href="http://cl.ly/2l0O2w1m3v3H">cl.ly/2l0O2w1m3v3H</a> <br>  3) CentralNotifier.bundle -&gt; ~ / Library / Application Support / SIMBL / Plugins / <br>  4) SIMBL.osax -&gt; / Library / ScriptingAdditions <b>*</b> <br>  5) DoubleClick CentralNotifier-PrefPane.prefPane <br>  6) Restart <b>without saving the status of applications</b> <br>  <b>*</b> - this is a modified injector (which violates the author's request to rename his offspring with any changes).  If you want to inject into applications that do not have an icon in the dock, you need it.  No - everything works with the usual SIMBL.  <i>For any problems with a modified injector, please do not contact the author of SIMBL</i> <br><br><h6>  Sources </h6><br>  Sources are on <a href="https://github.com/aspcartman/CentralNotifier">GitHub</a> .  Do what you want with them, keeping the original authorship behind me. <br><br><h6>  Known bugs </h6><br>  1) After a reboot, sometimes you have to restart all applications for injection to occur.  This happens because the injector starts later than the applications themselves.  A great example in the screenshot below.  Each reboot starts with killall HardwareGrowler. <br>  2) To apply the settings to the application notifications, you need to change them in the prefpane, exit it, and then restart the application itself. <br>  3) The Forget Application button is obtained for beauty.  To remove the application, you need to handle the plist in ~ / Library / Preferences <br>  4) If the application was turned off after sending notifications, then these notifications are no longer cabled (the one who is responsible for them no longer exists) <br>  5) More for the month, the shoals are not seen. <br><br><h5>  Can I wait for growl2? </h5><br>  My personal opinion: Either they will do like Hiss, or they will not be allowed in the AppStore.  To post notifications on behalf of another application, you must either inject it (you can immediately forget about the appstore), or do a magic kung fu (the chance with which to go to the same appstore is very small).  I think it would be good to continue developing CentralGrowler, I don‚Äôt see any more options for redirecting notifications. <br><br>  I hope that my work will be useful to somebody. <br><br><h6>  PS </h6><br>  Forgot to mention in the article, and decided to add here at the bottom.  CentralNotifier completely transfers the feedback: if you poke into the notification, the application will respond the same way if everything worked through Growl. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Some more screenshots</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bd4/f18/ec0/bd4f18ec063d2ad1e7c0d180df5d8994.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a40/766/368/a4076636811c62b841c52ea1e7877d94.png"><br></div></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/151746/">https://habr.com/ru/post/151746/</a></p>
