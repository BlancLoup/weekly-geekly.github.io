But truly hardcore translators do not work with prose, but with poems.  This is where the personal devil of every linguist is hidden. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In terms of difficulty, translating verses from 10 points gets 11. After all, in order to translate a poetic work well, you need to combine a number of factors in the final version:

    <ul><li>  <b>Accurate transfer of meaning</b> .  Poems for the most part are metaphorical works with a large number of epithets and allegories.  The translator must not only understand the essence of the work, but also accurately convey it using similar or similar literary techniques. </li><li>  <b>Rhyming</b>  The translator needs to pick up non-trivial rhymes that accurately convey the intonation of the poem.  But you should avoid rhymes like verbs in the infinitive or repetition of rhymed words. </li><li>  <b>Poetic size and rhythm</b> .  Ideally, the translation should have the same verse size as the original, up to the number of syllables in a line and accents.  But in practice it is extremely difficult, and sometimes completely unreal.  Therefore, translators are guided by similar rhythmic patterns.  If the original iambic, then the translation should be iambic. </li><li>  <b>Stylistics</b> .  Each poet has his own style of writing poetry.  It is expressed in the frequent use of any recognizable constructions or vocabulary, speech turns.  The most difficult thing is that even a good semantic translation can not convey the style of the original. </li></ul><br>  The result should be a work that completely conveys the spirit and idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe original.  Therefore, the translation of poems is often considered a much more complicated process than even writing them. <br><br>  Often linguistic features do not allow preserving the form of a poem when translating due to the banal lack of direct correspondence between metaphorical constructions and poetic metrics. <br><br>  One of the most difficult poets to translate from English is considered to be William Shakespeare.  And all because in his works he used more than 20,000 lexical items.  In this case, the poet captured all the stylistic layers of the language: from commonplace expressions to sublime aristocratic speech.  Moreover, Shakespeare actively created neologisms using words from French and German. <br><br>  Most often, translators try their hand at Shakespeare's sonnets.  They combine small size and high metaphoricity, so they allow you to experiment without excessive time and effort. <br><blockquote>  Shakespeare's Sonnets is 154 poems written by William Shakespeare from 1592 to 1599.  The whole cycle of sonnets is divided into separate groups by subject, the main of which are friendship, chanting of the beloved and love as a feeling. <br><br>  The poetic form of the sonnet belongs to the strict forms.  It consists of 14 lines, which are divided into two quatrains (quatrains) and two tertsets (three steps). <br><br>  Most often in sonnets are used rhymes of the ring <i>(abb)</i> or cross <i>(abab)</i> types. </blockquote>  The strict form of sonnets is another feature that complicates translation.  But this does not stop the translators, who over and over again try to more accurately convey the meaning and spirit of the poems. <br><br>  In the article we will consider only one sonnet and four variants of translations to it, we will compare the flow and methods of transmitting the meanings of different translators.  We will leave an assessment, which translation is better and more harmonious, because this is a matter of taste. <br><br><h2>  Sonnet 130: a parody of a woman's sublime odes </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/l-/wh/i7/l-whi7kwzrviih3edwjdu6qkv-s.jpeg"><br><br>  For a detailed analysis, we took the sonnet 130. It is slightly different from the sonnets, which extol the beauty of the beloved, because all comparisons here are built ‚Äúfrom the opposite.‚Äù <br><br>  Below we give the text of the sonnet with direct line-by-line translation: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ie/9b/wz/ie9bwzle5ommt8-x56p82d6yrvk.png"><br><br><h3>  Features of the work </h3><br>  The literal translation basically reveals the meaning of the work.  Shakespeare writes that his beloved is no better than other women, but she is still not inferior to those who are told false compliments. <br><br>  There are several specific points in the original that need to be further clarified.  In the text we denoted them by numbers. <br><br><ol><li>  <b>Breasts are dun.</b>  Firstly, the poet uses the plural of the word ‚Äúbreast‚Äù, which makes it more rough and refers specifically to the female breasts, and not to the breast as a whole as part of the body.  Secondly, ‚Äúdun‚Äù is a more rigid synonym for the word ‚Äúdark‚Äù, which translates as ‚Äúdirty gray‚Äù or ‚Äúbrown‚Äù.  Already with this, he emphasizes the satirical character of the sonnet - and for our contemporaries, it seems to be the whole thing. </li><li>  <b>If hairs be wires.</b>  What is meant here is not iron or steel wire, but jewelry - gold or silver, which decorated items made of precious metals, as well as objects of art.  Comparison of female hair with wire was very popular in the Middle Ages.  Although "black wires" further hints that the poet compares his hair with his favorite iron wire. </li><li>  <b>Damasked roses.</b>  The phrase has several meanings at once.  Damask roses were called embroidered roses on fabrics, as well as etched ornaments on blades of daggers and Damascus swords.  Because of this, the comparison also becomes rude, because the author does not see even such harsh roses on the face of his beloved. </li><li>  <b>My mistress reeks.</b>  Extremely rude, because ‚Äúto reek‚Äù means ‚Äústink‚Äù, ‚Äúproduce an unpleasant smell‚Äù.  Even in a metaphorical form, the phrase is clearly perceived as offensive. </li><li>  <b>Rare.</b>  Here the word does not mean "rare", but is synonymous with "precious", that is, "precious." </li><li>  <b>Belied.</b>  Very subtle play of words, because the word can be translated as ‚Äúslandered‚Äù and ‚Äúlaid‚Äù (in the sense of ‚Äúseduced‚Äù).  The last line is a thin banter over the ‚Äúsublime compliments‚Äù that medieval poets liked girls and women threw at them in order to drag them to bed.  Some linguists believe that here Shakespeare frankly trolls Petrarch and his sonnets, but this is just one of the hypotheses that cannot be proved or disproved. </li></ol><br><h3>  Translations of the sonnet 130 into Russian </h3><br>  With the nuances of the work figured out, now it is time to translate.  There are about 50 translations of this sonnet, which are recognized in literary circles. <br><br>  The translators broke up into 2 large groups: <br><br><ul><li>  The former transmitted the lyrical mood of the poem through metaphors and comparisons, but without the rudeness inherent in the original sonnet. </li><li>  The second tried to copy the satirical character of the work, using similar unflattering comparisons and rudeness, which are in the original. </li></ul><br>  We will analyze two translations from each group.  The translations of S. Marshak and N. Gerbel are lyrical, and the variations of R. Vinonen and I. Fradkin are satirical. <br><br>  Once again, we will not determine which translations are better - this is a matter of taste.  We will analyze them, examining the accuracy of correspondences, the harmoniousness of phrases and the general transmission of the meaning of the original. <br><br><h3>  Translation by S. Marshak </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dx/kb/cx/dxkbcxojxs_pw9rajxw35k3ie9a.jpeg"><br><blockquote>  Her eyes do not look like stars <br>  You can‚Äôt call corals <br>  Not white shoulders open skin, <br>  And there is a strand of black wire. <br><br>  With damask rose, scarlet or white, <br>  You can not compare the shade of these cheeks. <br>  And the body smells like the body smells, <br>  Not like a violet petal. <br><br>  You will not find perfect lines in it, <br>  Special light on the brow. <br>  I do not know how goddes parade, <br>  But sweetie walks the earth. <br><br>  And yet she concede so hardly <br>  Whom in comparison lush slander. </blockquote>  In the literary environment is considered one of the most successful translations.  In the version of Marshak there are many epithets (‚Äúsnow-white skin‚Äù, ‚ÄúDamascus rose‚Äù, ‚Äúdelicate petal‚Äù, ‚Äúperfect lines‚Äù), which add color and richness to the work. <br><br>  In mood and transmission of secondary meanings, it is very different from the original.  Marshak softened Shakespeare's original harsh and crude metaphors.  As a result, the original message ‚Äúmy beloved is not at all beautiful‚Äù turns into ‚Äúmy beloved is specifically beautiful.‚Äù  The difference is small, but the tone of the work is changed. <br><br>  Marshak uses sublime vocabulary - ‚Äúmouth‚Äù, ‚Äúforehead‚Äù, ‚Äúparade‚Äù, ‚Äústeps‚Äù, which rather accurately conveys the style of the original sonnet, in which the lexical structures that are obsolete today are widely present. <br><br>  For accuracy of transmission and improvement of harmoniousness, Marshak uses an inversion technique - rearrangements of individual components.  Consider this in more detail in two examples. <br><br>  <i>Original: My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/d-/ce/5v/d-ce5vbu4rcpaf9euj2azz2yc6g.png"><br><br>  The rules of the Russian language allow you to rearrange the semantic parts of the sentence, which helps to maintain the rhythm and harmoniousness. <br><br>  Also in the second example: <br><br>  <i>Original: I grant I never saw a goddess go</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ng/2n/ag/ng2nagdnodk3lgl-e_ygbjrlzxo.png"><br><br>  Inversion allows you to achieve more accurate matches in rhythm and well supports the lyrical mood of the poem. <br><br>  Now about the accuracy and consistency of phrases. <br><br>  A series of phrases absolutely accurately conveys the phrases of the original: a comparison of hair with wire, the color of cheeks with roses, the gait of the goddess with the mundane steps of his beloved. <br><br>  In some phrases, the translator uses substitution within the meaning.  "Breath" turns into a "body", while Marshak uses a neutral "smell" instead of the original coarse "reek" ("stinks"). <br><br>  There is no comparison of voices with music at all.  Instead, the lines appear: <i>"You will not find perfect lines in it, Special light on the brow</i> . <i>"</i> <br><br>  In general, Marshak well conveyed the message of Shakespeare, in which the real beauty of a woman is opposed to unattainable ideals.  However, compared to the original, the translation is softer and more emotionally neutral, with no hard epithets or metaphors. <br><br>  Total for the translation of Marshak are: <br><br><ul><li>  artistic epithets; </li><li>  the use of sublime vocabulary; </li><li>  inversion of individual phrases; </li><li>  softening the original sonnet feed and replacing rude words and comparisons with neutral counterparts. </li></ul><br><h3>  Translation by N. Gerbel </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/aa/fb/xo/aafbxofkh4r3yaz6qdhyv1ktbra.jpeg"><br><blockquote>  My love face does not look like the sun, <br>  Corals are brighter than their mouths are burning, <br>  When the snow is white, the beautiful chest is not similar to it, <br>  And her hair is silk - she has no cascade. <br><br>  I have seen many roses kept strictly in the gardens <br>  But they don‚Äôt have the likes of a sweet cheek <br>  And there are plenty of incense around, <br>  Than the fact that her mouth will rest. <br><br>  I love babbling to listen to her, but I know <br>  That music sounds better and more tender, <br>  And to the tread of the goddesses did not prirovnyayu <br>  Completely earthly steps my beloved. <br><br>  And yet for me she is a hundred times nicer <br>  All those whom it would be possible to compare with her. </blockquote>  Immediately struck by the changed number of syllables in the lines, because of which the rhythm of the poem changes.  In the original, the lines consist of 10-11 syllables, in the translation of Gerbel - 12-13.  It does not harm quality, but the design of the verse has been changed. <br><br>  Gerbel does not use pronounced metaphors and epithets, which relate to the description of the appearance of his beloved.  In general, the vocabulary of verse is mundane and even colloquially in places, which underlines the reverent attitude to a woman.  All the epithets in verse are quite simple: ‚Äúsweet,‚Äù ‚Äúbest,‚Äù ‚Äúbeautiful.‚Äù <br><br>  Like Marshak, Gerbel also uses an inversion technique, but in translation uses it more voluntarily.  The poem rather conveys the "spirit", but not the "letter" of the original. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kt/dw/df/ktdwdfbtka-b3u5kuyzsfi-iuyw.png"><br><br>  Gerbel widely uses the translation "by contradiction."  Shakespeare compares the hair of his beloved with wire, but in the version of Gerbel - silk.  The decision is controversial and somewhat clumsy, because it uses the rarely used and incoherent form of the pronoun "she" - "her." <br><br>  Gerbel also uses polysindeton - repetition of alliances in the sentence between homogeneous members.  Reception increases the emotional background of the poem and focuses attention on the enumeration of the merits (they are also disadvantages) of the heroine. <br><br><blockquote>  That music sounds better <i>and more</i> tender, <br>  And to the tread of the goddesses did not prirovnyu. </blockquote><br><br>  As for rhyming, rhymes are very simple, sometimes even unnecessary.  "It seems" - "similar", "many" - "strictly."  Therefore, the style of translation is very far from the original, in which rhymes can not be called banal or common. <br><br>  In addition, Gerbel also replaced all the sharp phrases of the original.  Gerbel replaced the hardest statement for neutral, removing all negative: <br><br><blockquote>  And there are plenty of incense around, <br>  Than the fact that her mouth will rest. </blockquote><br>  Total for the transfer of Gerbel characteristic: <br><br><ul><li>  simple epithets and their small amount; </li><li>  use common and close to colloquial vocabulary; </li><li>  polysindeton; </li><li>  inversion of individual phrases; </li><li>  simplified style and rhyme; </li><li>  mitigation of the original sonnet presentation and replacement of coarse phrases and phrases with neutral analogs. </li></ul><br><br><h3>  Translation by R. Vinonen </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xu/in/4-/xuin4-2uvacdnrvoqvdnliluv-q.jpeg"><br><blockquote>  There are no stars in the pupils of my woman, <br>  Ruby is redder than your favorite lip, <br>  And her chest, of course, is tan, <br>  Than the snow.  And naughty hair is coarse. <br><br>  I did not notice damask roses, <br>  What flourish in others on the faces <br>  Yes, and perfumes, if seriously, <br>  Hardly sweat in comparison is suitable. <br><br>  And she does not speak like a pipe, <br>  Not angelic on clay puts his foot ... <br>  And yet from his woman <br><br>  I am delighted.  And thank God: <br>  My love ‚Äî now there is no such thing ‚Äî is pure of poetic slander. </blockquote>  Vinonen tried to fully convey the mood and style of Shakespeare's sonnet 130. Compared with the lyric translations, it sounds much rougher.  Vinonen only partially softens some harsh expressions, but in general satirical and stebnom mood conveys. <br><br>  In the first line, instead of the original ‚Äúeyes‚Äù (eyes), he uses a rougher ‚Äúpupils‚Äù.  Further, the phrase ‚Äú... It is unlikely that sweat is suitable in comparison‚Äù is very tough. <br><br>  In general, the poem creates the satirical effect that the original has, without rassusolivaniya and admiration. <br><br>  At the same time, the translation is quite expressive, because Vinonen uses the well-established phrases ‚Äúthank God‚Äù, ‚ÄúI get excited‚Äù, which add emotion.  But in reality, the attitude towards a woman with all its flaws is transmitted by the last four lines. <br><br>  According to the original, there are shortcomings.  Vinonen quite freely makes the permutations of phrases, reducing or lengthening individual turns. <br><br>  For example, the two lines <i>"I love him hear it far more pleasing sound"</i> fit him into one - <i>"And she speaks not like a pipe</i> . <i>"</i>  This knocked down the form because of what the end, where the author expresses his love to the woman, stretched 4 lines instead of 2 original. <br><br>  Total for translation Vinonen characteristic are: <br><br><ul><li>  too loose attitude to the original rhythm and syllable; </li><li>  good transfer of a mixture of irony and satire, which is in the original; </li><li>  use of introductory constructions and common expressions. </li></ul><br><h3>  Translation by I. Fradkin </h3><br>  Unfortunately, the photo literary we did not find.  So here's Shakespeare with glasses. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ge/ml/zt/gemlztf9qh5ebvihawmy7cbg5yw.jpeg"><br><blockquote>  The eyes went, not the stars to her, <br>  And the lips do not look like corals <br>  Black wire sheaf curls <br>  And the chest is dark - not white skin. <br><br>  Cheeks are normal <br>  Compare them with white rose or scarlet, <br>  And the spirit is from the body that will score <br>  Simple smells of the earth, perhaps. <br><br>  More dear than other sweet talk, <br>  Though melodious it sounds hardly, <br>  And trampling sweet earthly girlish legs. <br><br>  Let these goddesses never see <br>  I swear she‚Äôs as good as she <br>  What a liar has offered up to put it more correctly. </blockquote>  Fradkin also tried to convey the ironic mood of the original sonnet.  The style, though slightly relaxed, when compared with the original, rather accurately conveys the message of the sonnet. <br><br>  Rough and deliberately simple expressions describe the shortcomings of a woman: "a sheaf of curls," "cheeks are common," and "the chest is dark."  But at the same time, the author conveys well the feelings that the author feels: ‚ÄúTo dearer than other sweet talk,‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd the tramp of lovely earthly girlish legs.‚Äù <br><br>  The accuracy of the translation is quite high, even though Fradkin rearranges the lines of the original - like 3 and 4 or 5 and 6. The statement itself is quite free, but only one moment is doubtful - ‚Äúto her‚Äù in the penultimate stanza.  Apparently, the translator simply could not find a decent rhyme to the successful last line. <br><br>  Fradkin also actively uses inversion.  As far as we have noticed, this is a popular trick to smooth out the rough edges of the original sonnets and a little trick that allows you to rhyme verbs, not nouns. <br><br>  The translator well conveyed the irony of the works and correctly walked around the ‚Äúinconvenient places‚Äù with unflattering epithets.  He gave rude expressions with caustic phrases, but avoided insults. <br><br>  For example, the phrase "And the spirit of such a body that scores Simple smells of the earth, perhaps," sounds rough, but not as rough as the original. <br><br>  Total for the transfer of Fradkin characteristic: <br><br><ul><li>  use of deliberately simple phrases </li><li>  inversion of individual phrases and even strings; </li><li>  the irony and satire of the original is faithfully conveyed; </li><li>  a great contrast between the description of the flaws and the declaration of love. </li></ul><br><h2>  findings </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zw/ut/yb/zwutybqnfk5jbmvrmts-bfrqi40.jpeg"><br><br>  Once again, we emphasize that the well-known translations of only a sonnet 130 are over fifty.  With all the desire we would not be able to consider everything - it already pulls on a small monograph on linguistics. <br><br>  As you can see, the styles and methods of translation are very different, because Shakespeare's sonnets are difficult to translate.  Translators get out as they can.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. <br><br>  If you do not associate with the original, all versions are interesting and original in their own way. <br><br>  But still, the perfect translation of the poem, which completely conveys the meaning, subtext and mood, is simply unattainable.  Literary critics agree with this, but each of us has our own opinion. <br><br>  What translation of 130 sonnets do you like better?
