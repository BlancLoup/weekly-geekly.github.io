For me, that post was a turning point - I realized what my enthusiasm for electronic gadgets translates into and how I can be useful to society.  But I'm running ahead ... <br><br>  So, hello everyone, my name is Nikolai.  For a long time I was the author here and on Habrahabr (and at the last I even received the status of ‚Äúlegend‚Äù), wrote topics for fun, wrote topics at the request of corporate blogs and so on.  But at some point I <s>imagined myself to be the smartest I</s> realized that my reviews were closely within the framework of Giktatimes and I launched my project - the site ‚Äú <a href="https://vybor-prost.ru/">The choice is simple</a> .‚Äù <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e79/b1d/2b5/e79b1d2b52b84d0ca91144307ddaf379.jpg"></div><a name="habracut"></a>

      <b>UPD: the</b> publication had to temporarily hide due to the load on the host <br><br>  The concept of the site is very simple - the digital technology market is changing as rapidly and suddenly as the ruble exchange rate.  So when someone is going to buy something, he does two things: <br><br><ol><li>  He goes and reads forums and reviews thoughtfully for a couple of days, plunging, so to speak, into a <s>depressed</s> topic.  This is the way of the samurai and he is very well described by reference in the first paragraph. </li><li>  It relies on the opinion of friends or sellers of consultants or on the appearance of the product. </li></ol><br>  Both options have flaws.  First: the obvious loss of time and the need to finely filter information.  As you know, every forum visitor will ardently defend their choice.  Therefore, it is easy to leave the forum to buy some conditional ‚ÄúVAZ‚Äù, because it ‚Äúif something is repaired for three rubles and in general in the capable hands of hoo‚Äù.  Who confesses before himself that his hands are not ‚Äúhoo-hoo‚Äù. <br><br>  And the second: there are not enough friends for all occasions, and it is also desirable that a friend has physical access to two or three competing models - for objectivity.  Sales consultants, for obvious reasons, do sell what they have or what they need to sell. <br><br><h2>  And then, oh, I come </h2><br>  In fact, it somehow turned out that I have a rather large amount of knowledge of technology.  Not to say that universal, but big.  I have been writing for various computer publications for more than 10 years (not always under my last name), and even once worked in the legendary Computerra.  Every day I spend several hours reading thematic resources, reviews and reviews.  And, most importantly, at work, I regularly deal with different equipment.  This allows me to consciously make a choice in those categories about which I write. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/30c/178/bb8/30c178bb83f94c65b68bc81fa1f80cdf.jpg"><br><br>  Therefore, when another acquaintance came to me with the question ‚Äúwhat is better to choose‚Äù and I began the explanation from the creation of time, it dawned on me - I will write the text once, and then I will give a link to it.  So it went. <br><br><h2>  Site concept </h2><br>  My site is aimed at search engines.  Those.  I want anyone who drives a ‚Äúbest <a href="https://vybor-prost.ru/2016/06/10/best-electric-toothbrush/">electric toothbrush</a> ‚Äù or ‚Äú <a href="https://vybor-prost.ru/2015/07/29/flash_usb3-0/">best USB 3.0 flash drive</a> ‚Äù conventionally onto my page, where in the first paragraph it says ‚ÄúSanDisk Extreme will have the best flash drive in terms of price / quality ratio‚Äù.  Well, then, in a large longrid it will be explained in detail why.  Those.  you can go and on the first paragraph - the answer has already been received.  But I try to describe in detail why this choice is really better. <br><br>  Hint: I could be wrong.  Moreover, it is generally impossible to please everyone.  But I am not without reason, I hope that, on my advice, a person will buy at least not bullshit.  And is it important. <br><br>  I will not lie that the concept is completely mine.  I spied it on several American sites when I was looking for some regular piece of hardware.  From there, the sections ‚Äúwhy you should believe me‚Äù on each page and a couple of similar approaches are taken.  But I thought that something like this was missing among the resources of the RuNet.  People are drowning under the ratings of the ‚Äú10 best robot vacuum cleaners of 2017‚Äù from which it is impossible to know anything useful.  And you need a simple answer, preferably with a minimum fork of choice. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/fc0/fee/48d/fc0fee48deb34738b5f6a518a7d4de51.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, another caveat - to choose something from the reviews is also not very successful.  Manufacturers, as a rule, give for reviews top-end or unnecessary gadgets that need to be promoted in sales.  Well, good and really running things are popular and do not need much advertising.  Because of this, they fall out of the general information field, but they pop up in thematic communities. <br><br><h2>  Lecture hall </h2><br>  As you already understand, my audience is people who are not very technical.  They need specific answers.  For example, a wife who decided to give her husband a smart watch, but does not want to explore the fascinating world of wearable electronics.  Nevertheless, in the texts I try to maintain balance, without slipping into quite explanations on my fingers or delving into technical jungles.  This is fucking difficult.  Therefore, it does not always work, and I am very glad to comment with criticism. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/1fe/998/65e/1fe99865e3e9407fbf4f160e3389e189.png"><br><br>  However, I have several purely technical topics.  For example, while understanding the topic of SSD format M.2 (sata or pci-e), I <a href="https://vybor-prost.ru/2016/09/06/ssd-m-2-sata-pcie/">began to</a> compile a table of compatibility of laptops and SSDs of various form factors.  I started with the translation of something similar, but now I have moved far ahead. <br><br><h2>  And if you do not pay, my dear man </h2><br>  There is quite a logical question - how to make sure that I do not write "Jeans."  Those.  Did the manufacturer bring me a suitcase of money for me to advertise his flash drive?  I answer - no way.  One can only believe.  However, I will immediately say that my site is such a hobby, because I earn elsewhere, including reviews.  Yes, the site has banners from Google and there are a couple of referral links to the store in thematic sections (where I am confident in quality and do not go against conscience).  But it only pays for hosting, because there are some tears.  In a word, only hardcore, i.e.  the site is working for the idea, as if pathetic and ridiculous it sounded. <br><br>  This approach has both obvious flaws, for example - I write to the site no more than once every two weeks, i.e.  as soon as free time appears, besides, a lot of resources are eaten up by checking information and updating articles. <br><br><h2>  Speaking of update </h2><br>  As I said above, my concept is closely within the framework of hyktayms or any other collective resource, because any information becomes outdated very quickly.  Therefore, I either have to rewrite old articles on Hickstays, where no one reads them already (and I am always interested in feedback).  Or write a new one.  But!  In this case, I cannot copy the ‚Äútheoretical‚Äù part each time, and this means a loss of information.  Additionally, the hell knows what version of the page (newer, even newer or older) the user will throw the search engine to.  Therefore, I would like to have only one page where I edit the information.  And it will be the most relevant. <br><br><h2>  Results </h2><br>  My site is already more than a year old, during which time a small audience has grown - from 500 to 1000 people per day, depending on the season.  Own ambitions, too, have grown up and want to increase momentum.  Therefore, I want your opinion and feedback. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/403795/">https://habr.com/ru/post/403795/</a></p>
