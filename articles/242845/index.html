Evolving, evolving, they continue to occupy leading roles in our daily life.  Let's follow the development of the data center in the world is not quite real, in the world of cinematography, in the world of pop culture.  So‚Ä¶ <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fbc/446/7d8/fbc4467d87834acba0e0b44ef0724e54.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Data centers and cinema?  They have repeatedly for many years been provided to our eyes from blue screens (at least as a concept).  Along with supercomputers, hackers in various action movies and fiction (let's take Star Wars, for example), the data center often appears in the lead roles.  It will be interesting to follow the development of the concept of cine date centers throughout the development of the world of cinematography.

      Initially, futuristic boxes with flashing LEDs - this is how the data center was presented in some films, such as Hacker, designed to convey the idea and concept of mystery, the power of data centers from the screens to the viewer.  In more modern films, such as ‚ÄúExcellence‚Äù, such centers acquire a look that more closely matches reality, since data centers actually look like. <br><br>  Going to the distant 1960s ... <br><br><h4>  2001: A Space Odyssey / 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) </h4><br>  Two opposite emotions are caused by ‚Äú2001: A Space Odyssey‚Äù: people either love or hate this film by director Stanley Kubrick.  A very unhurried plot of the film, a series of fascinating slow-moving combined shots.  EAL-9000 (HAL 9000) is a heuristic programmed algorithmic computer, the system based on artificial intelligence is similar to the eye in the form of a lens.  Possessing a multitude of abilities, HAL 9000 can also lip-read, appreciate art, experience emotions. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/c8N72t7aScY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhE641nApbNvaG_3jcrRxgN3jbEWQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The HAL 9000 is the first and most important computer device that has ever been used.  Machine with a human mind, ambition and pride, getting rid of the witnesses of their mistakes.  The protagonist of the film turns off the HAL 9000 finally, entering the room that is behind the supercomputer is essentially the storage center for the ‚Äúmind‚Äù of the HAL 9000 machine, that is, the prototype of the data center.  Representing a rectangular room illuminated with red light with various boxes that store and process information. <br><br><h4>  Terminator 1 and 2 / Terminator 1 and 2 (1984, 1991) </h4><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe film literally dreamed of James Cameron.  In the center of the plot - the confrontation of a living soldier and a cyborg terminator.  In this film, the data center serves as the universal scale of Mr. Evil.  There is a large number of super cars, Skynet (Skynet) - a representative of artificial intelligence.  The war endowed with self-awareness machines and humanity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5dd/0ef/310/5dd0ef310e38431abe4ee8087262455a.jpg"><br><br>  2001: Space Odyssey and Terminator with their comic unreal super machines HAL 9000 and Skynet led to the creation of the <a href="http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/">IBM WATSON</a> super computer, which is equipped with an artificial intelligence question-answer system. <br><br><h4>  Die Hard 4: Freedom or Death / Live Free Or Die Hard (2007) </h4><br>  A group of hackers is tasked with creating programs that effectively break into a repository of classified information.  Cyber-terrorists use programs from hackers to break into the FBI network and begin destroying the infrastructure of all the US.  Starring the always toughie Bruce Willis.  Hackers manage to use the capabilities of the system with a single control panel, which looks awesome, if not for its implausibility. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/247/ae8/2a6/247ae82a602a41fba8529fd9c5a97deb.png"><br><br>  It should be noted that Warlock is played by Kevin Smith.  Warlock manages a ‚Äúcommand post‚Äù which is actually located in the basement, but can be viewed as a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/ua-hosting/blog/236217/">home data center for data storage</a> such as the end of the 90s.  Looking at the "changing / mutated encrypted algorithms" of a solid-state drive, that the most important state information is in a separate backup data center, the conclusion is one - and not a horror movie in front of us, the audience ?! <br><br>  I remember another home data center, from the film <a href="http://www.tcm.com/mediaroom/video/343396/Demon-Seed-Movie-Clip-Proteus-4.html">‚ÄúThe Devil's Seed,‚Äù</a> in which a certain Dr. Frankenstein creates a super ingenious computer with an ‚Äúover-brain‚Äù named Proteus 4. He naturally refuses to serve his creator, through the terminal penetrates his house, which just stuffed with electronics and starts to control everything.  Horror, and only ... <br><br>  It is impossible not to recall another well-known film whose plot revolves around artificial intelligence. <br><br><h4>  The Matrix / The Matrix (1999) </h4><br>  Computers have enslaved humanity, not even, not enslaved, but simply created for them their own world, absolutely analogous to the one in which they used to live.  What is the result: cars got themselves a good source of energy, and people have the opportunity to live, love, etc. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/IojqOMWTgv8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgRMwWl9BrxtM-21CtfMkZCE1-HPw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  And here we have an effective solution to the problems associated with the search for alternative energy sources for the data center.  And at the same time, the output of energy is more than required for keeping the same people in capsules.  The perfect solution!  And everyone, well, almost everyone is ‚Äúhappy‚Äù living in such a world, although computers could come up with something more insidious for the fate of people. Since the machine is completely organic, all its parts make up an anti-utopian data center. <br><br><h4>  Ocean's Eleven (Ocean) Eleven Friends (2001) </h4><br>  In films since 2000, data processing and storage centers deviate from an abstract concept and take on a more realistic look.  Already we meet more "classic" data center with traditional racks.  In this film, one of the criminals sneaks into the data center of the casino.  It connects the device to a network cable, which, as if by magic, provides access to video streams from casino surveillance cameras. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qb2tjzecJX4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhh2LZf1OSADcbhoVglbEfqzZKbv9Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  Agent 007: Skyfall / Skyfall Coordinates (2010) </h4><br>  Finally, we begin to see scenes in the data center resembling reality.  James Bond performs the task, saving a hard drive with a list of British intelligence agents who are embedded in the largest terrorist organizations in the world. In one of the scenes in front of James Bond, we see a neatly systematized data center in a huge room that belongs to the anti-hero of the film.  Compass Datacenters CEO Chris Crosby called Skyfall - the <a href="http://www.compassdatacenters.com/oscar-snub/">film of the year about the data center</a> . <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/oXt_lLKVdD4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhSsbl5GAtDVGH89cDJR2k6MdE5Tg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  Iron Man 2 / Iron Man 2 (2010) </h4><br>  The Iron Man film features the Oracle logo several times - an American corporation, the world's largest software developer for organizations, and a supplier of server hardware.  And in the van of the protagonist installed their complex <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/press/173663">Exadata</a> .  A rather powerful database machine (Database Machine) for those who are interested, the X2-8 version of the complex included two Sun X4800 servers with eight processor sockets of the Socket LS type, and fourteen Exadata Storage Server storage nodes.  Eight-core Intel Xeon X7560 processors with a frequency of 2.26 GHz and 1 TB of RAM in each of the two nodes were installed in the servers of the complex.  Only one complete set was supplied (full cabinet) with a cost of $ 1.5 million for consumers from the USA.  The weight of the cabinet is 943 kg, the peak power consumption is 17 kW, the average power consumption declared by the manufacturer is 11.9 kW. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/p3AIrW41Z8w%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgXjT8X8kr2uDcIoOvL1W961EmAUQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  In the van for a couple of thousand dollars stored cabinet for $ 1.5 million, is also a question, how do they provide energy consumption?  Another <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/ironman3/omag-mj13-ironman-1936895.pdf">fictitious article</a> was published on how Stark Industries uses a cloud data center owned by Oracle.  So, as we can see, the evolution of the data center on blue screens takes place partially, acquires real external characteristics, but does not quite correspond to reality. <br><br><h4>  Tron: Legacy / Tron: Legacy (2010) </h4><br>  In this film, data centers are presented in the "future."  Therefore, their appearance does not match the modern.  Server cabinets are not arranged in rows, but are evenly distributed from each other.  Kinolyap - you say, but who knows, maybe in the future the amount of heat generated by servers will be zero?  Which will allow to place server cabinets in this way. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e6f/4a7/df6/e6f4a7df6f67451c8d7d4fe235d7fd58.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Excellence / Transcendence (2014) </h4><br>  The superiority of Wally Pfister is original in that it reveals the possibility of combining man and machine.  The talented scientist Will Custer is working hard for the benefit of science and humanity, he is eager to create the greatest artificial intelligence on the planet in order to overcome disease, old age and restore ecological balance. <br><br>  All you need to create the perfect data center is your body, the body of a person.  The mind of the protagonist Will (Johnny Depp) is transformed into artificial intelligence and builds the most beautiful data center that has ever appeared on blue screens.  The whole network becomes part of Will.  The entire infrastructure of humanity depends on it. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/QheoYw1BKJ4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhh6ehee6qI_ZvjJ2NwBdjTo-d1ykQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  ‚ÄúTo destroy artificial intelligence, you need to turn off all computers on the ground, and turn off the Internet.  Apparently a big red switch still exists.  About non-volatile memory (for example, such as all hard drives and SSD), they apparently were not up to date.  Or our modest artificial intelligence was not up to date ... " <br><br>  The data center was located in the fictional town of Brightwood, 5 levels underground.  It is built under the ground based on the goals of security, maintenance and control of temperature.  Solar panels act as a source of energy. <br><br>  The evolution of data centers in the history of cinematography from the Space Odyssey's HAL computer to the artificial intelligence from The Excellence film has come a long way.  Such a concept as a data center is open to the general public.  Initially, being a set of flashing buttons and boxes in movies, data centers gradually began to be presented from the screens to the audience in their real ‚Äúappearance‚Äù. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/242845/">https://habr.com/ru/post/242845/</a></p>
