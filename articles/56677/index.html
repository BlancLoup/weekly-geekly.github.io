I hasten to share my impressions of work, and you, in turn, decide whether you really have a reason to love the mambo, or you can no longer trust the guys) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b75/1b5/570/b751b55709cc94904722ed299ebc5f54.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  So, the professional mouse <b>Razer Mamba</b> .  Overview of new <b>traffic</b> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Equipment </h3><br>  I was very surprised by the presentation of the device - this I have not yet met.  It is impossible not to talk about it) <br>  Those who have bought Asti Mondoro champagne at least once will easily imagine the size of the package.  The upper part of the box is made of transparent plexiglass, the lower part is hidden behind a black matte paper construction.  The mouse itself, as a museum piece, is fixed on a special plastic stand.

For some reason, server racks are recalled from work :) There are glossy icons and a pull-out tongue on the three boxes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/da8/21a/aaa/da821aaaaa7827b68fef1e131ebca1ec.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In one box, with the USB logo, is wrapped in a fabric lining, USB-cable with a cap for the connector. <br>  In the second box are a lithium-ion battery and the battery compartment cover - all in their bags. <br>  In the third box, the largest, is a charging dock, about which a little later. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8d1/773/1a3/8d17731a3a5f017a72cc68d0a4645ec1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Thus, the total configuration was as follows: <br><br>  - Mouse Razer Mamba; <br>  - Docking station for charging; <br>  - USB-cord to power the device; <br>  - Battery and cover that closes it; <br>  - Documentation, quick installation instructions, product catalog, sticker. <br><br><h3>  Appearance </h3><br>  First about the wire and docking station. <br>  The contacts of the cord are yellow, but I doubt that they are gold-plated (and even if so, it hardly gives anything, because USB connectors in the computer are the most common).  The cord itself is wrapped with braided threads, which, apparently, has a positive effect on its durability and recognition.  Indeed, it looks unusual and beautiful.  The length of the order of two meters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/de0/c88/1a8/de0c881a877a64eeaa6225d408ec18bd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7e6/210/a27/7e6210a277ed050f34689011c53d2261.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The cable itself is USB (a) -&gt; miniUSB (B), however, the B-type connector is somewhat non-standard - it is installed on a special plastic part that is needed for attaching to the mouse and the docking station. <br>  <b>The docking station is</b> made as follows - the trapezoidal part is fixed on a square stand, the ends of which light up when connected to the computer in blue.  There is a company logo and two contacts on the ‚Äúbevel of a trapezoid‚Äù, the USB connector is deeply hidden from the back. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6cc/489/ab3/6cc489ab3a7a8a4123958fddb1da86d5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  When connected to a computer, as I said, the stand starts to glow bright enough blue, and if you leave the mouse on the charge, this glow pulsates.  Fascinating!  If you wish, you can turn off any of the glows programmatically. <br><br>  <b>Mouse</b>  Actually, the most important thing in this review. <br>  Made of black matte rubberized plastic - it is very pleasant to hold in hands.  On the part under the palm is a glossy logo, which, by the way, does not spoil the overall picture and does not feel like a hand.  The whole look, which is very aggressive, speaks about the serious intentions of the mouse :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/918/690/9fb/9186909fbf75657981aff20fbfc82821.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  From the controls, the mouse has two standard buttons, a wheel (which can be clicked and evade to the right), two buttons under the thumb (front and back) and two buttons next to the left mouse button - to switch the rodent sensitivity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a06/4a4/347/a064a43470f7f9b859c9dd387183fa63.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/657/437/210/6574372101a1044c0ecdd99ba9372115.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Plastic wheel, rubberized, with serifs.  Glows on the sides in blue, in complete darkness it looks like two blue stripes.  It is pressed easily, evades too.  It is a pity that only in one direction - I usually assign switching to tabs for this action (in ICQ, browser, file manager), and this is usually done not only in one direction) And ... it is unusual already, after the MicroGear wheel: ) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9c9/26b/758/9c926b75849583c270dfd141c0a3ec2b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  All buttons crush easily, somewhat springy.  The main buttons are pressed quite loudly (which is very critical for me at night - the growing champion sleeps very sensitively).  Thanks to their concave shapes, fingers do not move out. <br>  On the back of the rodent there is a wedge-shaped recess for charging with two contacts, a hole in the laser sensor ( <b>5600dpi</b> !), An on-off button for the mouse, a connection button (just in case) and a lever for fastening the connector of the cord to be connected.  As it turned out, it is very convenient if the battery runs out - put in the wire and forget about the problem.  I almost forgot to mention the Teflon inserts - thanks to them the mouse slides perfectly along the table surface. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fc7/068/c64/fc7068c64b942dce1ea27ffa5b174107.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3a5/b3f/f2a/3a5b3ff2ae17bc2d5ff88bd555b22dcb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The ergonomics of the device at the height - the hand is very comfortable, there is simply nothing to complain about.  And this is despite the fact that I am used to a special relief base on the right side of my <b>Logitech MX Revolution</b> . <br><br><h3>  Preparatory work </h3><br>  All you need to get started is to insert the battery and close it with a lid.  In this state, the weight will be 130 grams.  You can not insert, and connect to the wire - we get 110 grams.  Everything is ready to go. <br><h3>  Turn on and work </h3><br>  Turning on the mouse (switch on its back), put it on the carpet.  The maximum sensitivity is set (5600 dpi) - from the edge to the edge of my 19-inch monitor, the cursor passes almost instantly (on the table it drove no more than a centimeter).  Rodent really reacts to the slightest impulses! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9ce/ee6/8af/9ceee68affe64ae07d2c7414213837f0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It is very unusual to get used to such sensitivity is very difficult.  After 10 minutes of such races, I reduce the sensitivity to 3000 - this is already more comfortable.  Switches the sensitivity of the two buttons that are located next to the RMB - it is convenient that you do not need to climb into the settings. <br><br>  With a carpet grip is excellent, but the mouse goes around the table just fine.  By the way, it is noticeably lighter and quieter than the same Revolution (possibly due to the last term of use). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/15c/21b/158/15c21b158bf3771a071235d79d96a2d0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The operating time without a wire (after a full charge, at 3000dpi) turned out to be 12 hours of active movements - I was even tired then) The mouse stopped completely unexpectedly - no one would look at the indication all the time.  So it would be great if the mouse somehow advertised exhaustion of forces - it could be a barely audible ‚Äúpeak‚Äù or a wink scrolling. <br>  If you use the mouse in the usual many mode, then the charge is enough for about two days, a little more. <br><br>  Charging is also a receiver - with a rodent they operate at a frequency of 2.4 GHz, which eliminates any delays.  More precisely, of course, there is a delay, as in any other case, but here it is extremely small - 1 ms (one thousandth of a second).  During this time you will not have time to absolutely nothing, and the response of your monitor is at best 2ms :) There are no delays.  As with the connection with the wire, and without it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1e8/859/ca4/1e8859ca4b1da3f5d125cda5af1ac066.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Software </h3><br>  The manual says that for additional features, you can download proprietary software from the company's website.  At the time of this writing, it was <b>Mamba_Driver_v1.02.exe</b> of April 3, weighing 30 megabytes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/630/e01/a77/630e01a77029afc398f4b64d112ba642.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Installation takes place without any nuances, a reboot is required.  After a reboot, a black and green round icon appears in the tray with a kind of company logo.  With a double click a window appears, on top of which ‚Äú <i>Reading configuration from Synapse.</i>  <i>Mouse cursor may become non-responsive for a few seconds.</i>  "That can last from a few seconds to a minute :( I think this will be fixed in future versions. <br>  In the main window of the program there are 5 tabs - ‚Äú <b>assign buttons</b> ‚Äù, ‚Äú <b>adjust performance</b> ‚Äù, ‚Äú <b>manage profiles</b> ‚Äù, ‚Äú <b>manage macros</b> ‚Äù and ‚Äú <b>lighting and maintenance</b> ‚Äù. <br>  The first tab contains a rotating 3D mouse model with numbered buttons.  For each button, you can customize the action you want or disable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7a2/2bc/288/7a22bc2883d6eeeccc6e56d156e47614.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/eb0/417/2af/eb04172af8a09dab95b29f94c2247b9c.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8ba/8fd/1dd/8ba8fd1ddd97a4ad4c7a5b53532fd08d.png" alt="image"><br><br>  On the second tab is the performance tuning. <br>  The actual value of sensitivity is displayed, under it is a scale from 100 (funny) to 5600 (not funny) dpi - choose any value and go into battle!  For X and Y coordinates you can assign different sensitivity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a80/3de/a02/a803dea02748517243c20341c5e3c728.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Also available are 10 points of the ‚Äúacceleration‚Äù scale of the cursor and the setting for polling the USB port (125, 500 and 1000 Hertz). <br>  I almost forgot - you can adjust the sensitivity you need, which will be switched with the buttons on the mouse.  They can be from two to five.  Everything is clear and understandable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a81/1f7/cb3/a811f7cb394c4213bf51baad5da39aa4.png" alt="image"><br><br>  On the tab management profiles, you can create, it is not strange ... profiles.  They can be saved, deleted, imported.  There is a preview of the profiles - in the window that appears, button actions and sensitivity settings are displayed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3f8/247/be1/3f8247be10028446f4cb83845d2f350c.png" alt="image"><br><br>  On the macro tab you can create ... exactly macros.  Any sequences you need - clicks, keystrokes ... will be useful for cheaters and those who like to play on the console :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2f7/532/64a/2f753264a4786bc7fb7e7177bf3d52a0.png" alt="image"><br><br>  On the last tab, you can turn off or turn off any of the highlights (charging, scrolling and power-sense indicator), as well as check the update and reset everything to factory settings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3a4/763/932/3a476393223afd792489e4f070804838.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The settings are good for everyone - flexible and understandable ... it's a pity that when they are saved, the program sometimes ‚Äúhangs.  No, the information does not disappear, just saving the settings to the memory of the mouse takes a long time (and sometimes it was instant).  In general, while I set up what and how I wanted, I was pretty impressed.  Although I can not say that the wood is raw.  But it is convenient - you have come to any place with your mouse, and your configs are always with you, even if the computer does not have firewood for the mamba (99.99%). <br><br><h3>  Summary </h3><br>  If I saw this mouse on the store counter, I would definitely perceive these enormous sensitivity values ‚Äã‚Äã(5600dpi) as a marketing ploy.  But this would be so only if it was released by some kind of left-wing company that never produced such products ... they say, made printers-scanners and then bang - a record-mouse for gamers! <br>  Another thing, when the mouse from Razer - a company that specializes in gaming devices and eventually only hone their technology.  In this case, the Razer Mamba is rather the result of evolution rather than marketing, although the latter cannot be ruled out. <br>  The engineers of the company need to think about the batteries, more precisely, about the optimization of energy consumption and then it will be even greater separation from competitors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e20/b85/a72/e20b85a72afa9b5ee93dfb5af37bb32b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Check weighing </h3><br>  <u>pros</u> <br>  - The best presentation of the product from those that I saw, a rich equipment; <br>  - Stylish appearance, good build, absolutely no brand surface; <br>  - Additional buttons, sensitivity switch button; <br>  - An opportunity to work in two modes - with a wire and without; <br>  - Replaceable battery; <br>  - Functional software component; <br><br>  <u>Minuses</u> <br>  - High cost (about 5500 rubles); <br>  - Short battery life - about 12 hours of continuous use.  About two days in normal mode; <br>  - ‚ÄúSuspended‚Äù program when applying settings. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/NBAv5DpFf5k%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhEpv8_KYL8dIWG1OaSWgui5CuszA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h3>  Total </h3><br><br>  I don‚Äôt know any more companies that gamers would trust 100% - so <b>Razer</b> simply does not have the right to make mistakes.  It turns out that the company has taken a very bold step, because the overwhelming majority, due to established stereotypes, constantly insist on the latency of wireless interfaces.  Dear - breathe easy, <b>delays - NO</b> ! <br>  At the time of this review, a mouse on the Internet was sold only in one online store at a price of 5590 rubles, which, of course, for a device of this type is quite a lot.  On the other hand, any specialized professional devices were never cheap. <br>  If you are a simple Internet user and sometimes like to fill up a couple of neighbors when playing on LAN, then this mouse is hardly vital.  If you are the winner of tournaments and various championships in eSports, or, most likely, just a hardcore gamer with a huge diagonal on the table - this is something that is guaranteed for you. <br>  Exceptionally positive emotions from the product as a whole, if you have money - you will not regret! <br><br>  <b>* UPD *</b> <br>  Cool video: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ug55vw6-pB8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhdt17BZmpcj22SommDvXy00wtADQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Soon again, interesting;) <b>Good luck!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/56677/">https://habr.com/ru/post/56677/</a></p>
