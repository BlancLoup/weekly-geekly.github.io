  <section class="page js-page"><h1>[Habra-offtopic] Maratona di Roma, or the first marathon for an IT person</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In Rome, on April 8, 2018, I ran my first marathon (time: 4: 29.41).  We have a very sporting company (see the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/lanit/blog/338488/">report</a> on the IT Championship in the Race of Heroes), but many friends and colleagues who congratulated me didn‚Äôt have any idea what a marathon was and how to interpret my result. <br><br>  Our dialogue was approximately as follows (D - friend, I - I): <br><br><blockquote>  (D): Well, Che handsome!  Did you run something there, they say? <br>  (I): Thank you, yes, marathon. <br>  (D): Well, you do not get smart, tell me how many ran? <br>  (I): 42 km 195 meters, of course, at 4:30. <br>  (D): A fig he ran 42 km for 4:30!  You're just a mega monster! </blockquote><br>  For me, these questions even seemed wild at first, because  I have already plunged into the running theme.  Therefore, I decided to write a small report on my first marathon, briefly describe what it is and whether it is difficult to prepare for an ordinary IT person for a marathon.

Having run to Athens, he managed to shout: ‚ÄúRejoice, Athenians, we won!‚Äù And fell dead. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bt/1c/ji/bt1cjilwxghuhqj6zefyhef--ss.jpeg"></div>  <i>Luc-Olivier Merson "Soldier Marathon".</i>  <i><a href="https://www.wikiart.org/ru/lyuk-olive-merson/pheidippides-giving-word-of-victory-le-soldat-de-marathon">A source</a></i> <br><br>  According to this legend, running a marathon is very cool and deadly.  I believe that my friends' enthusiastic greetings are based on their school knowledge. <br><br>  However, according to marathon trials in the United States from 2000 to 2009, the frequency of such deaths is about 0.75 per 100,000 finishers. <br><br>  Some comparisons ( <a href="http://www.freehealthworld.ru/healths-586-1.html">source</a> ): <br><br><ul><li>  the probability that you will be eaten by a shark is 1: 3 million, </li><li>  the probability of breaking in the next car trip is 1: 4,000,000. </li></ul><br>  As for me, it is much better to die as Fidippid with a strong bare ass under the admiring glances of the Athenians, than in some Zhigulis with a beer belly. <br><br><h2>  Distance </h2><br>  The official marathon length is 42 km and 195 meters. <br><br><blockquote>  The International Olympic Committee in 1896 measured the actual length of the distance from the battlefield in Marathon to Athens;  it was equal to 34.5 km.  The length of the race was not originally fixed, since all that was important was that all the athletes ran along the same route.  The exact length of the Olympic Marathon depended on the route chosen at the respective Games.  At the first Olympics, it was equal to 40 km.  The starting point for the Olympics in 1908 in London was moved from a mark of 25 miles to a mark of 26 miles 385 yards (42 km 195 meters), so that the royal family could comfortably watch the mileage from the windows of Windsor Castle.  Finally, the length of 42.195 km as the official marathon run length was established in 1921 by the International Amateur Athletics Federation (the current IAAF).  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2584%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD">A source</a> </blockquote><br>  However, in practice, participants run a greater distance.  This is due to suboptimal cornering, or if an athlete is distracted by running to a pit stop or if a participant is distracted too much by the audience ‚Äî he kisses, hugs, claps his hands, etc.  In this regard, experienced athletes control this aspect: they try not to run in a crowd, optimally take turns on a tangent, etc. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2s/l0/i-/2sl0i-irrya7h-_vzt-dzvqgrd4.jpeg" width="600"></div>  <i>Rome Marathon Route</i> <br><br>  In general, 42 km 195 meters is quite a lot in the scale of modern cities.  Therefore, the track eventually covers a significant part of the city.  A marathon participant can be said to run through the entire city (at least its historical part) up and down. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/v0/yq/-m/v0yq-mrukd7cf51o0aultoqp_i0.jpeg" width="600"></div>  <i>Here I run up to <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D1%2589%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D1%258C_%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B2%25D1%258F%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE_%25D0%259F%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0">St. Peter's Square</a> in the Vatican.</i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qo/aj/gi/qoajgijke07crs0orxnhwi32mv8.jpeg"></div>  <i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/maratonadiroma/videos/10156054205801211/">A source</a></i> <br><br>  When we ran through the square, it turned out that it was full of people and someone was preaching to them (this was probably the pontiff (now a certain Francis occupies the office of Pope)). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vk/3y/pe/vk3yperlegz-h_5nie6sxsbkcls.jpeg" width="600"></div>  <i>So I run up to the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2597%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA_%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B2%25D1%258F%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE_%25D0%2590%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0">Castle of the Holy Angel</a> - a structure that has a long history, witnessed the most important historical events, a place that some popes chose as their residence.</i> <br><br>  <i>Pretty ridiculous construction for my taste.</i>  <i>But, of course, stunning views that open from its roof.</i>  <i>I fotkat there the day before.</i> <br><br>  My distance was 42 km and 930 meters, i.e.  I ran somewhere else 735 meters, well, or this is a mistake of my watch. <br><br><h2>  Training </h2><br>  According to Herodotus in 490 BC.  it was all a bit different: <br><br><ul><li>  Fidipppe was a messenger, i.e.  as if by a professional athlete </li><li>  before the battle, he was sent to run to Sparta for reinforcements and back (230 km), </li><li>  he could participate and be injured in the battle itself, </li><li>  besides him, other volunteers also fled to Athens, and he had to overtake them in order to bring the message first. </li></ul><br>  Pidippid's professional training completely changes everything.  According to Herodotus, Fidippid is more likely the founder of a triathlon or all-around, rather than a marathon. <br><br>  In general, if short distances can be overcome without any special consequences, probably, anyone.  Well, the time will be better or worse, but somehow you will be feeling your 400 meters, 800 meters, 5 km or even 10 km.  For example, I participated in the 10 km race in the Moscow Marathon in 2017 without any preparation for the company (result: 00: 53.35). <br><br>  A marathon without training is better not to run.  Good news: it turns out that preparing for a marathon is very cool and not at all difficult.  All you need is a pair or two of sneakers, running clothes for summer / winter, a training plan, a sports watch, and of desire.  It is even better to train with a trainer less often or more often to correct the technique of running.  Only 5-6 months of training, and you - a marathon! <br><br>  I already had a watch like this - Apple Watch Nike +. <br><br>  It turned out that the preparation plan is also not a problem at all.  Manufacturers of sportswear and equipment have already taken care of everything.  There are tons of free or low cost options. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8j/le/7b/8jle7bxsbye621ggbfq9f28jy5k.jpeg"></div><br>  This is how a preparation plan is made through the <a href="https://my.asics.com/uk/en-gb/running_plans">Asics</a> website  You indicate that you want to run a marathon and when, the result of your previous race, gender, date of birth.  Then you will have to specify how many days a week you can train and that's all - the system will calculate the predicted result and plan for it.  The same can be done through the <a href="https://runkeeper.com/">Runkeeper</a> iOS application and then use it to track runs. <br><br>  I used the workout plan from <a href="https://www.nike.com/ru/ru_ru/e/nike-plus">NikePlus</a> and their iOS and Apple Watch apps ( <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/nike-run-club/id387771637%3Fmt%3D8">Nike + RunClub</a> ).  Everything is quite convenient - I see in the application a workout plan for every day / week before the race itself, I record my runs with the Apple Watch app, and they are immediately taken into account in my plan. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lv/mi/ds/lvmidslwkzhmtrdik3zbf8guf_q.jpeg" width="250"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/i6/lz/nv/i6lznvbr5_zrgtl5vcmdkiin1ua.jpeg" width="250"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oj/-e/cu/oj-ecujbm2d5fdo27j0c-_3whyu.jpeg" width="250"><br>  <i>Screenshots of iOS applications <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/nike-run-club/id387771637%3Fmt%3D8">Nike + RunClub</a></i> <br><br>  The picture above shows <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/nike-run-club/id387771637%3Fmt%3D8">screenshots</a> from the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/nike-run-club/id387771637%3Fmt%3D8">Nike + RunClub</a> iOS application.  It is shown how to create a new plan - choose a marathon, the day of the upcoming race, enter additional information and the plan is ready.  Then you can see all the planned workouts for each week before the race.  Jogging information can be entered manually or monitored via Apple Watch. <br><br>  With the same success, you can use other options - <a href="https://www.endomondo.com/home">Endomondo</a> , <a href="https://www.strava.com/athlete/training-plans/running">Strava</a> .  Subscription is worth some money, but it is not very expensive. <br><br>  When to find time for training?  In fact, it is full!  I, for example, like to run after work - this is how I let off steam after a busy day.  If you run through it, thoughts become clear, somehow the tension goes away by itself, and even new ideas and solutions of some problematic issues come.  If I didn‚Äôt run, I‚Äôd probably just be stupid in front of the TV, trying to somehow recover after work. <br><br>  Some of my friends just started running to work and / or back.  Fortunately, we have a gym with a shower in the central office of <a href="https://lanit.ru/">LANIT</a> .  In the same gym, you can do a workout on a treadmill during the day before lunch, for example.  Someone prefers to run in the morning before work.  In general, the mass of options.  Most importantly, it just brings pleasure.  And if you like something, then there will definitely be time. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jj/ts/mm/jjtsmmmuu_o5c_cfpukelbgxqjq.jpeg"></div><br>  It is best to train not just like that, but choose a specific start, register for it, and prepare purposefully.  In this case, you will clearly understand your goal, and it will spur you on.  In addition, you will be spurred by paid air tickets and a hotel, which you can lose if you merge. <br><br><h2>  Nutrition </h2><br>  ‚ÄúEveryone can run 20 miles, but no one knows what awaits him after that,‚Äù wrote the 1972 Olympic champion American Frank Shorter.  - Carbohydrates give the body about 1200 kcal, in addition, up to 800 kcal, it can produce from its own fat reserves.  In total - 2000 kcal.  And since when running for each mile, an average of 100 kcal is spent, the calculation is simple: there is only enough energy for 20 miles.  Then they run on the character. ‚Äù <br><br>  That is why they say that the marathon begins after the 30th kilometer, and among athletes there is such a thing as ‚ÄúWall‚Äù, i.e.  when there is an overwhelming desire to stop, to go the distance, tiredness comes on, etc.  In order to delay or reduce this effect, athletes are trying to increase muscle glycogen stores before the race.  Simply put, they eat pasta and similar dishes the day before.  Before the triathlon races and long races, a special event is very popular - pasta-party.  In Rome, such an event was not, apparently, as without it, everyone eats solid paste every day. <br><br>  It can be assumed that Fidippid did not have the ability to carry out a full-fledged carbohydrate loading on pasta-party in wartime conditions.  Worse, if during the race itself, he had limited ability to drink and eat.  Imagine what ‚ÄúWall‚Äù he experienced! <br><br>  During the marathon, the body overloads and reacts specifically to food.  What you can safely eat normally, you will not get into the throat after the 20th kilometer.  Therefore, nutrition is also necessary to train.  It is recommended that you plan your marathon meal plan in advance and train it during long runs. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rc/a7/kc/rca7kcdgr3ftubpsr8k40lojf7g.jpeg" width="600"></div><br>  My meal plan was as follows: <br><br><ul><li>  three days of rejection of vegetables (because they are rich in fiber); </li><li>  on the eve of solid pasta with small meals; </li><li>  on the day of running in the morning oatmeal on water with a banana and boiled egg; </li><li>  1 gel 5 minutes before the start; </li><li>  1 gel 45 minutes after the start; </li><li>  1 gel every 30 minutes; </li><li>  every 3rd gel is caffeinated. </li></ul><br>  During the marathons organized food points.  In Rome, food items were every 5 km - they were given bananas, apples, oranges, cookies, water, PowerAid.  Maybe there was something else from the food, but since I carried everything with me, I didn‚Äôt really pay attention to the menu. <br><br><h2>  Expo </h2><br>  Expo is an event that precedes the marathon, where participants get their numbers with chips, etc., as well as in one exhibition hall a bunch of stands from manufacturers of sportswear and equipment, sports nutrition, representatives of other marathons, charitable organizations, etc. are assembled. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cv/sc/h4/cvsch4drp4jjctm2vqtpjzhq9mu.jpeg"></div><br>  At the Expo, I was given an envelope with a number with a chip, a participant‚Äôs instruction, confirmation that I had paid for the engraving of a medal, a backpack, a bag, a T-shirt, a bunch of promotional materials. <br><br><h2>  Race </h2><br>  The number of participants in the marathon can be tens of thousands of athletes.  A starting area is organized where things can be deposited, where all athletes gather in starting groups (or waves) depending on their results. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7y/xl/tq/7yxltqtlrid0bqflvkxwrcyexqq.jpeg" width="600"></div>  <i>The entrance to the starting area is at the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9">Coliseum</a> .</i>  <i>There are trucks for storing backpacks and a lot of toilets.</i>  <i>We lived near the start / finish, so we did not deposit anything.</i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qn/su/gr/qnsugrt6cp2edtqlenkcyiykh3s.jpeg" width="600"></div>  <i>All are quietly selected to start along Via dei Fori Imperiali, near the Imperial forums.</i>  <i>First, the elite starts, then the athletes with a fast time, then the average time, and then all the others.</i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uq/dq/ll/uqdqllkolja44nuj5utckqa2q6a.jpeg"></div>  <i>We start at <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_(%25D1%2585%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BC)">Capitol Hill</a> .</i>  <i>Behind was the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9">Colosseum</a> .</i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_l/pc/ku/_lpckumanxqdhylt23jko8jqrfy.jpeg"></div>  <i>The countdown is conducted individually for each athlete, starts at the moment of passing through the starting frame and ending at the moment of passing the finishing frame (except for the elite - for them, the start is on a signal).</i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/v3/zk/33/v3zk33f16pszkrimtlrc3vbuhwm.jpeg"></div>  <i>The first 5-10 kilometers is a rather dense crowd.</i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/km/8e/qy/km8eqyugrga47vcqccgthmhhnna.jpeg"></div>  <i>Someone just running marathons is no longer fun.</i>  <i>Therefore, they indulge in all serious things ...

Of course, a couple of days you will be on the stairs soooo elegant.  But if you were preparing for a marathon, eaten properly before and during, properly decomposed in the distance (did not rush at all pairs), went to the bathhouse and go for a massage after the race, then after 3-4 days you will feel like a new motorcycle! <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6p/vg/lp/6pvglpfzialpunldybannak1dkg.jpeg"></div>  <i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/maratonadiroma/videos/10156054205801211/">A source</a></i> <br><br>  Depending on your level, it will take several months minimum and more to prepare, it took me 5.5 months, every week 4 training sessions.  It will take a small investment in sportswear - sneakers, clothes for summer and for winter.  Perhaps the results of your first marathon will not be so impressive?  but the buzz you get from this huge. <br><br>  Marathons are held in the leading capitals of the world, you can combine business with pleasure.  The distance of the marathon is such that with your feet you will run up and down almost the entire city, at least - its historical part. <br><br>  Finding time for training is easy.  Running is very fascinating in itself and allows you to unload the brain after work (or vice versa charge in the morning).
