    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  That's what helped and helps me.  I hope you will be somehow useful.  Part of the advice repeats the already stated in similar articles. <br><br>  <b>1. Outline</b> If this is a new multi-faceted concept - first think on paper / typing, not limiting yourself in anything.  Draw a memory card.  And then use Evernote, quizlet and even Anki to form a new fact in the form of a short Question / Answer.  I advise Anki, even if it doesn‚Äôt have a modern interface, but this program reminds you when you should once again go over the list of questions, recalling the answers.  This should be done at certain intervals - I will not give them here, there are a lot of detailed articles. <br>  I‚Äôll warn you - it‚Äôs very tiring to form a question / answer for every fact, but using the recall system you can remember a huge amount of nuances and features.  Super memory, as it turned out, is not necessary. <br><br>  <b>2. Record yourself on the recorder.</b>  Turn on the recorder and talk about what you have learned.  The record can then be erased.  The fact itself is important - it seems to you that you are speaking, listening to you, starting to formulate your thoughts in a different way.  It promotes in-depth study. <br>  You can even turn on the voice recorder on your mobile phone, walk down the street / stand in line and broadcast.  People will think that you are talking on the phone, you will not embarrass anyone. <br><br>  <b>3. Share new knowledge with others.</b>  It is not necessary to share in the "professor" - "student" mode.  You can ponder with the interlocutor, ask his opinion.  This should be done on Skype, in person, and even by phone (which is probably the most difficult). <br><br>  <b>4. Continually expand your social circle.</b>  Find "colleagues", ask them about their professional development, ask clarifying questions.  With tools such as Skype or social network, you can simultaneously maintain correspondence with many interesting people.  Your horizons will reactively expand and will help you out even once. <br><br>  <b>5. Read, scanning material.</b>  No time to explore all that I wanted.  You can quickly run through the articles on the textbook.  Some pieces will be stored in the memory.  Later, when you stumble upon a problem, associative thinking will tell you that "somewhere you have already seen the solution."  This gives confidence that the problem is solved, removes the state of vacuum, when there is a problem and there are absolutely no thoughts on how to approach it and whether it can be solved at all. <br><br>  <b>6. Read in transport / in line / for any waiting.</b>  It's amazing how much time we spend traveling to and from work, standing in lines and so on.  If you spend 2 hours a day on the road, then a week is 10 hours (more than a working day!), And 40 hours a month (a working week!).  Imagine how much you can learn during this time. <br>  If you are traveling by car, listen to podcasts and radio. <br><br>  <b>7. While learning, sentence to yourself or out loud the emotional remarks of the movie characters.</b>  "Let's see what we have here!", "Here's your grandmother, and St. George's Day!"  (examples from the ceiling).  This will quickly give your learning an emotional touch, lift your spirits, and speed up the perception of the material. <br><br>  <b>8. Add new elements of perception - sound, tactility.</b>  Difficult to use advice, however, can also speed up learning.  It is often said that it is necessary to represent what you read - improves perception.  But technical texts are difficult to visualize.  Instead, you can, for example, imagine how a tower crane builds a house from blocks.  In the text "first ..." - your crane put the first block-floor, you "heard" the sound of "boo," "felt" the weight of the new block.  In the text ‚Äúsecondly ...‚Äù - your crane installed the second block-floor, heard ‚Äúbang‚Äù, felt how ‚Äúhard it became‚Äù to the first block. <br><br>  Everyone can have their own idea.  An example with a tap is an attempt to explain the approach.  ‚ÄúBut the tap does not reflect any knowledge,‚Äù you will say.  His task is not to reflect knowledge, but to create an emotional coloring and strengthen your concentration. <br><br>  <b>9. Learn a little about new materials on vacation.</b> <br>  Yes, you came to rest, not to study.  However, take a little time to study the material on the seashore / amid the mountains / on the deck of a pleasure yacht.  Then, when you study the material further, you can feel pleasure and enthusiasm - after all, in your mind the topic you are studying is associated with rest and beauty. <br><br>  <b>10. Start learning material from books like Dummies.</b>  Like all previous tips, this tip is controversial.  But what is the profit?  In books like ‚ÄúFor Dummies‚Äù or ‚ÄúHead First,‚Äù the material is illustrated using funny and funny situations.  Thus, the first acquaintance with a new area you associate with humor and a little fun.  In the future, you will deepen your knowledge and recall the ‚Äúfirst experience‚Äù of humor, which will lift your spirits, create an emotional mood, and improve perception. <br><br>  Try it, share your impressions.  Thanks for attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293730/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293730/</a></p>
