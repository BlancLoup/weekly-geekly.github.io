Use loyalty to promote the game. <br><br>  The method of achieving the task is based on close and most important individual interaction with players and will be considered on the example of using in the game with real numbers at the time of writing the article. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A few words about the game, so that it would be clear further where the events and data for analysis come from. <br>  The game is called ROD (Remember or die).  The name is embedded the main essence of the game. <br>  We see a maze and try to remember it.  The labyrinth disappears in 3 seconds and from memory you have to go to the exit.  Bump into obstacles can not.  There are enemies in the game and of course there are bonuses with which it is much easier to pass the level. <br>  The game has a built-in level generator.  Levels can be created, played, sent to the server and played in levels created by other players. <br><br>  Behind the curtain the following happens. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/f22/203/67a/f2220367a8f4cbad7aa7e0a504bb00bd.png" alt="image"><br>  Thus, we have quite a lot of information about the player's behavior. <br>  So, we have: <br>  ‚Ä¢ The date of the first launch of the game; <br>  ‚Ä¢ The language used on the player device; <br>  ‚Ä¢ How many levels the player has passed; <br>  ‚Ä¢ How many attempts did each player take to complete the level; <br>  ‚Ä¢ The average number of attempts of all players for each level; <br>  ‚Ä¢ How often the user plays; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Whether the player downloads levels from the server or passes the standard; <br>  ‚Ä¢ How many levels does the player create? <br>  ‚Ä¢ How to respond to requests in messages.

      The first where we started using this information is a floating level of complexity. <br>  The difficulty of downloadable levels is from 1 to 5 stars.  Initially, the difficulty is determined by the moderator.  Each time a player passes the downloaded level, statistics about the number of attempts is sent to the server.  The average number of attempts required to pass a level is constantly recalculated.  After 100 passes, the difficulty level is set, which is calculated by the server, thus adjusting to the skill level of the players. <br>  It is very convenient and flexible.  If many fans of hardcore games come to us, then in a short time the levels with 5 stars will meet their expectations. <br><br>  The second is incoming messages. <br>  Globally, incoming messages are divided into 2 types: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Without response. <br>  ‚Ä¢ With a response action. <br><br>  Messages without reciprocal action is used to give gifts to players and increase loyalty to the game.  They look like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/970/295/4e6/9702954e607d5a0bb2494ea1d77b2e38.png" alt="image"><br>  As soon as the message is viewed, a bonus is added, and a note about viewing is sent to the server. <br><br>  We can also use them for rewards for certain merits.  These can be traversed control lines or well-created levels. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/d92/f97/cfe/d92f97cfed0cb49a5334ceed6f547b00.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Much more interesting messages with the response.  With more, this is the same message as it was written above, but with response options.  Depending on the option chosen, a certain action takes place.  Also, each response is sent to the server. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/007/0cd/f2a/0070cdf2a544f3306cd40582c3d47455.png" alt="image"><br>  There are many options for action, but we have tested so far 2. This is a request to put a rating and a request to recommend the game to friends.  The player can agree to the request, refuse or click later.  Regardless of the choice, the player receives a bonus.  That is, we first give a bonus, and then ask for something. <br>  By agreeing to put a rating, the player enters the google play on the application page. <br>  Such messages are sent to a very limited number of users.  This is very important, since you need to ask exactly those users who are very likely to give a positive rating.  By sending messages to everyone in a row, you can get a lot of negative feedback from users who haven‚Äôt figured out the game yet, or they don‚Äôt like it at all, but didn‚Äôt have time to delete it. <br><br>  Here, for example, selection parameters with a request to put a rating: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Levels completed - 10; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Russian language; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Days in the game - at least 7; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Enters the game - at least 4 times a week. <br>  Such users turned out to be only 7.3%. <br>  However, 38% of them agreed to put the rating, and many have written positive reviews. <br>  54% clicked "Ask later".  And only 8% refused. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/104/59b/539/10459b5398f428931052395f1ed26518.png" alt="image"><br>  As a result, the distribution of assessments is as follows: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/8e0/4f6/797/8e04f6797226948b86c8c7e54dd96565.png" alt="image"><br>  94% positive feedback.  Not bad, right? <br><br>  The parameters for selection with a request to recommend a game to a friend are not at all tough.  We do not risk rating, but we should not ask everyone either.  A user who has not yet understood whether he will like the game or not will definitely not recommend it to his friends.  But later, perhaps, he will be happy to help in the promotion. <br><br>  So: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Levels completed - 8; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Russian language; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Days in the game - at least 3; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Enters the game - at least once a week. <br>  Such users turned out to be 48%.  The priority for this message is low, so it will come if there are no other messages. <br>  Of those who looked at the message, 43% agreed to recommend to a friend (send a message with a link to the game).  49% clicked later.  And only 8% refused. <br><br>  In conclusion, we can say that the earned user loyalty helps a lot to promote the game.  Having received the bonus, the user is in a good mood and is ready to go to meet you, especially since no one forces him.  Remember: Give first, but not all.  Then ask, but not everyone. Treat your users well.  Help them clearly and not explicitly, and they will repay you the same. <br><br>  Thanks for attention. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297238/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297238/</a></p>
