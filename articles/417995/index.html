Here, of course, it is not entirely clear, and who will let you delve into the same papers?  Climb to information systems?

      <br>
      Another question, to the paragraph below, nobody developed the order of control, the operator must establish it himself!  At the same time, the order should be ‚Äúproper‚Äù, and who should evaluate this? <br><br>  Put the question in another plane - the human resources that will be required for such control.  Those.  a person who came to, for example, 1C, to a <a href="https://www.cloud4y.ru/cloud-services/1c-hosting/">SaaS provider</a> , well, in order to be faster / easier / cheaper there, he must now have a person in his staff who will develop the ‚ÄúProcedure for the operator to control the actions of a person ...‚Äù and then implement it?  On the other hand, one thousand of his clients who want to exercise their right to ‚Äúproper control‚Äù each of them will also have fun at the SaaS provider, how many additional resources will be needed for this? <br><br>  In general, some puzzles.  We also remember about the ‚ÄúAdministrative Code‚Äù, which also changes?  Perhaps we quote almost the entire text: <br><blockquote>  <i>Article 13.11 of the Code of Administrative Offenses of the Russian Federation (Collection of Legislation of the Russian Federation, 2002, No. 1, Article 1; 2007, No. 26, Article 3089; 2017, No. 7, Article 1032) to add with parts 8 and 9 of the following content:</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>"eight.</i>  <i>Failure by the operator to fulfill the duty of exercising proper control over the actions of the person processing the personal data on behalf of the operator as provided for by the legislation of the Russian Federation in the field of personal data -</i> <i><br></i>  <i>shall entail a warning or the imposition of an administrative fine on citizens in the amount of from one thousand to two thousand rubles;</i>  <i>on officials - from three thousand to six thousand rubles;</i>  <i>for individual entrepreneurs - from five thousand to ten thousand rubles;</i>  <i>on legal entities - from ten thousand to thirty thousand rubles.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>9. Violation by the person processing personal data on behalf of the operator of the requirements of the legislation of the Russian Federation in the field of personal data -</i> <i><br></i>  <i>shall entail the imposition of an administrative fine on the operator who instructed this person to process personal data: on citizens in the amount of from three thousand to five thousand rubles;</i>  <i>on officials - from five thousand to fifteen thousand rubles;</i>  <i>for individual entrepreneurs - from ten thousand to twenty thousand rubles;</i>  <i>on legal entities - from fifteen thousand to thirty thousand rubles. "</i> </blockquote><br>  As they say, hello to operators!  - up to 30 thousand fine. <br>  Handlers - the same amount. <br><br>  Hope dies last, and it‚Äôs too early to make a panic, and it can be reduced to a dialogue between the operator and handler: <br><br>  <i>- Observe?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Yes!</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- The proper control is over.</i> <br><br>  Those who are interested to get acquainted with the full texts of these projects can find them by reference: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://regulation.gov.ru/projects">On Amendments to Certain Legislative Acts of the Russian Federation (in terms of clarifying the principles of processing personal data in state information systems)</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://regulation.gov.ru/projects">On Amendments to Article 13.11 of the Code of Administrative Offenses of the Russian Federation</a> </li></ul><br>  <b><a href="https://www.cloud4y.ru/about/news/white-paper-zakon-o-personalnyh-dannyh/">Follow the</a> link to download our <a href="https://www.cloud4y.ru/about/news/white-paper-zakon-o-personalnyh-dannyh/">White Paper on Federal Law No. 152</a> .</b> <br>  This is a book that was published to help eliminate confusion in the processing of personal data and clearly describe the process of bringing personal data to IP in accordance with the laws of Russia.
