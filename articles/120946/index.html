To say that I was surprised - to say nothing.  The first thought was ‚ÄúMicrosoft should rewrite the store code so that it could be used in WM7,‚Äù and the second, ‚ÄúMicrosoft recognized the defeat on the PDA market and is beginning to collapse.‚Äù <br><br>  The first paragraph of the letter looks like this: <br>  ‚ÄúDear Windows Mobile 6.x user, <br><br>  Microsoft is shutting down My Phone for Windows Mobile 6.x.  It also closes the Windows Marketplace mobile website.  As this may concern you, pay attention to the details below. ‚Äù

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  This email came to me because I was once an active WM user. <br><br>  I must say right away: I have never seen WP7 in my eyes and can‚Äôt say anything about this system myself.  But with WM of previous versions I namayals - God forbid everyone.  My first handheld was the <a href="">iPaq 3130</a> and there was <a href="">such a</a> camera for it.  The kit then cost as a basin in excellent condition.  I did not remember what kind of winmobile it was on, but I had ambivalent feelings.  On the one hand, I was very pleased with the color display, scheduling capabilities, vocabulary.  On the other hand, I was incredibly enraged by the complete lack of ergonomics of device control. <br><br>  Over the years, the situation has not improved one iota.  There were iPaq both in personal and corporate use, there were Nokia and FujiSiemens on WM.  The last straw was the HTC HD2, which more or less can be used only within the framework limited by the interface of HTC Sense.  After the iPhone, it was ... well, I don‚Äôt even know what to compare ... probably with a transfer from the passenger compartment of a long limousine with a bar and girls behind the wheel of the Niva.  I hurt him less than six months and bought a phone on Android, which I never regretted. <br><br>  All these years, especially the last three before I spat on WM, I was tormented by one thought: ‚ÄúBilly, Stevie, anyone!  Honey, take 15 minutes of your precious attention to your miscarriage called Windows Mobile and make it not look like an atavism porn.  Hire three to five normal interface designers and lock them in the room for six months.  And then half a year collect feedbacks and edit. " <br><br>  Here, wait.  WP7 came out, which is praised in almost all reviews, but something tells me, practically whispers in a theatrical whisper that a Cossack is misguided.  Severe statistics show that WM-devices are sold a little better than nothing.  Even a couple of reviews on Habr√© ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/windows_mobile/109587/">1</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/microsoft/109321/">2</a> ) only makes me squint my left eye in disbelief.  It seems to me that MS is now making sales of devices with WP7 only on XBox users and those who are tired of the dominance of apples and green aliens. <br><br>  Why was all this written? <br>  Besides that, I believe that MS naturally pissed off the handhelds market (if you call things by their proper names).  Now they will have to perform an incredible performance and cost of a head over to win at least 20% of the market of the tubes on which WP is installed.  When the iPhone first appeared, I read the opinion of MS top manager in the key ‚ÄúApple‚Äôs phone is a competitor to Vinmobile?  Do not make me laugh, and my sneakers.  He can't even save and paste. ‚ÄùAnd what do we see at the end of 2010?  - "... If you are not confused by the lack of a Russian keyboard, multitasking and copy-paste (all this was done from the iPod Touch and iPhone 3 years ago) ..." Well, isn't it funny? <br><br>  Now, it seems, copy-paste has been adjusted, but the fact is that WP7 is three years behind competitors.  According to the results of 2010, iOS made WM at times in the market of corporate handsets.  And on the second place is Blackberry, and on the third, attention, Android!  WM has about 7% left on its own corporate market, which is 20 times less than the total market.  Epic fail. <br><br>  I really want MS to take up mobile applications thoroughly and be able to reverse the situation from a completely disastrous to a confident significant share in the next couple of years.  I like Windows as a corporate work environment and I like their integration into everything.  And if they can make it so that, out of curiosity, I have an interest to buy a WP-phone, then I will assume that they are moving in the right direction. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/120946/">https://habr.com/ru/post/120946/</a></p>
