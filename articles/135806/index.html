Or maybe the other way around? <br><br>  As a child, I watched a movie on TV (there was no internet yet).  I do not remember the names - about the border guards.  At the frontier post there was a suspicion that the lamp that shines above the house on the ‚Äúother side‚Äù conveys information.  Checked - no radiation detected. <br>  Well, they did not find it ok, but the phrase stuck in my head for a long time. <br><br>  Last New Year wanted to do something original for the holiday. <br>  Controllers like I learned a long time ago, I learned to flash the LED. <br>  A thought occurred to me, is it possible to make it so that using a lamp to transmit information?  Apparently a phrase came up from the movie.

      - And what will be interesting to people? <br>  - A lot of things, but the simplest is the time. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And then spun ... Options, methods, schemes. <br>  I decided to show the time with flashes of light. <br>  Something like ‚Äúthree short whistles‚Äù. <br><br>  Since the construction will be on a high pipe, the watch chips are eliminated - whatever one may say, but they will still run away or even worse - they will be left behind. <br>  Correction by radio or IR - for a long time to do. <br>  Stopped on the GPS receiver.  Slightly more expensive, of course, but a huge pile of problems disappears. <br><br>  The display principle is very simple: at first the number of flashes shows the hours, then, after a short pause - minutes. <br>  To distinguish hours from minutes, flashes had a different duty cycle ‚Äî the watches had a visually longer flash time. <br><br>  From the appearance of the idea to the first implementation, not even a day passed. <br>  Thanks to the breadboard, left over from one of the previous projects. <br>  I installed a powerful LED on the output of the device, sent a stream of information to the output from the enterprise, in order to view the operation of the device from the side. <br>  Time was read very easily. <br><br>  The next morning, the first critical reviews went ... <br>  It turned out that outbreaks greatly interfere with the protection of their duties. <br>  But in general, the idea has earned! <br><br>  To improve the perception of time, I decided to make the color separation of hours and minutes. <br>  At the same time, the pulse time made the same for hours and minutes. <br>  Applied RGB-LED strip with IP65. <br>  Since the tape was not enough for the entire perimeter of the viewing platform of the pipe, we had to abandon the stretching along the length and make the radiator in the form of a lamp, winding the tape over the cylinder. <br>  To protect against curious birds and even more protection over IP, the emitter was placed in a transparent flask.  As what the filter for water purification was used. <br><br>  Initially, the entire structure placed in the flask.  Upstairs there is a GPS receiver, in the center of the cylinder is a controller board, on the cylinder there is a ribbon with LEDs. <br>  For this, we had to open the GPS receiver. <br>  The autopsy surprised me ... The board was not protected with varnish; an RS-232 chip was installed with a temperature range from 0 to 70 degrees. <br>  I had to cover the board with glue from the thermogun. <br><br>  The operation of the device in the flask did not like ... Though the LEDs are highly efficient, but the efficiency is far from 100% and the whole economy warms up very well, which significantly reduces the life of the radiator. <br><br>  It was decided to make the case ventilated.  For this purpose, I designed a small process on top, covered with a cap from the condenser body.  Natural semi-inch filter openings remained for circulation. <br>  To protect against solar radiation, the LED strip was covered with shiny aluminum foil and pierced the holes for the LEDs (many of them turned out to be there ...). <br><br>  The GPS receiver and power supply brought out in an external box made of cast aluminum. <br>  In order for the receiver to work, I sawed the hole from above and closed it with a lid from the tank for microwave ovens. <br>  To protect against solar radiation - the unit was plastered with the same shiny foil (there was no time to paint, the New Year was in the nose). <br><br>  Mounted the unit and the emitter on the corner and forward, that is, upwards - for installation! <br><br>  What happened: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ANbDUWRyuJg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjXVBRpjk-9wta8wp6QnAIWkzYkgw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Long thought out the name.  There were many options. <br>  And so, as in fact - it is a lamp that shows the time, then stopped at the option ‚ÄúTime Lamp‚Äù. <br>  Googled, it turned out the original name. <br><br>  Among the shortcomings it can be noted that it takes a long time to count the time at the end of the hour, but on the other hand there are no perfect hours. <br>  From the idea to the implementation, a little less than two months left after work. <br>  The project was made as a hobby for testing ideas with showing time pulses of light. <br><br>  <b>Additions.</b> <br><br>  <b>1. In perspective, there is an idea to make a clock on a green laser.</b> <br>  Or, as a safer option - <b>on a powerful static anti-aircraft searchlight</b> with a small angle of divergence of the beam. <br>  Pros: <br>  1. Change the name to "Ray of Time." <br>  2. Indications will be visible from any point - just one device to a small city is enough. <br>  3. You will not need towers to set the clock. <br><br>  It is only necessary to solve the problem of maintaining the cleanliness of the laser / projector exit at precipitations and leaf fall. <br><br>  With a stable position of the beam problems with the aircraft should not be. <br><br>  The backlight in this case naturally disappears. <br>  It will only show hours and minutes. <br><br>  <b>2. The number of time display methods is increasing.</b> <br>  The comments have already proposed several different options for how time can be shown. <br>  It seems to me that most of them have the right to life, you just have to try to make such a watch and see what happens. <br><br>  <b>3. Lamp time near.</b> <br>  I posted a <a href="http://foto.mail.ru/mail/radikn/1127/1180">photo of the</a> lamp.  Next - the unit where the power supply and GPS-receiver. <br>  Tape did not want to fix the area, secured it with steel wire in isolation.  It turned out surprisingly simple and strong. <br><br>  <b>4. Options for designs and emitters.</b> <br>  Came up with various design options.  Or rather, invented them before, along with the clock.  Just seeing the interest in the design, I decided to post. <br>  Can someone do something like this or invent something based on the display principle applied in the ‚ÄúTime Lamp‚Äù. <br>  - Separate LED.  It is possible to achieve the smallest possible size for a watch.  Theoretically - reduce to the size of the LED. <br>  - The clock, which is the backlight of the switch. <br>  - LED built into the wall and invisible.  Highlights through wallpaper or facing from the inside. <br>  - Wrist Watch.  A dot on the face, the whole face, or the whole watch case may flash. <br>  - Framing the object with a light cord. <br>  - Weakly lit point-LED, for example for a room at night.  Home Firefly. <br>  - Construction in the form of a ball, cube or toy on the table. <br>  - The crown of the Christmas tree. <br>  - Souvenir. <br><br>  The continuation is yours! <br><br>  <b>5. Electric circuit.</b> <br>  Explanation of the electrical <a href="https://docs.google.com/open%3Fid%3D0B38yPPb71lGRNWYyZWVhODQtYTU3Zi00OWY1LTg2ZjQtZWQ4MWE5ZDI5MDg4">circuit</a> . <br>  1. A power supply for a specific voltage ‚Äî such is it on a pipe. <br>  LED strip shines beautifully in the voltage range of 12 ... 13.8V. <br>  2. If you use a GPS receiver with a TTL level, or use an hour chip as a time source, you don't need a MAX232 chip and the circuit becomes obscenely simple. <br>  3. If the time source is made on the controller itself, then nothing will be left of the circuit. <br><br>  <b>6. The program of the controller.</b> <br>  So that those who wish can easily repeat the project or redo it on a different type of controller, I post <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/12Khw9--rJZUCRcSxgXfhr03Ws6OjlKaeBltcRmrnoYw/edit%3Fhl%3Dru">the work program</a> for general access. <br><br>  <b>7. Printed circuit board.</b> <br>  The final part of the additions to the project is a <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer%3Fa%3Dv%26pid%3Dexplorer%26chrome%3Dtrue%26srcid%3D0B38yPPb71lGRMzRlOGQ1OWYtMTRiZS00ZjVjLTg4ODMtMThjNWZiOTNmNzdm%26hl%3Dru">printed circuit board</a> . <br>  Explanations. <br>  LUT-technology.  Kayka around the board - for better gluing paper. <br>  Disorder in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãsupply + 12V from the fact that in my version was installed input connector and a diode on the power supply.  Then he refused all this, he didn‚Äôt redo the board. <br>  The inscription on the printed circuit board + 12V corresponds to + 13.8V on the electrical circuit. <br>  All the details in the SMD version, except for the microcontroller and one resistor on the red color (so that there are no jumpers on the board). <br>  Board made turnkey IRF7343. <br><br>  That's the whole project. <br>  Whoever repeats it or does something of its own on this principle - post it on the Internet and write, it will be very interesting to see what happened. <br>  It will be possible to leave the link on the video page ‚Äú <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DANbDUWRyuJg">Time Lamps</a> ‚Äù in YouTube. <br>  It is especially interesting to see other designs of emitters. <br>  And maybe someone swings on the spotlight? <br><br>  <b>PS</b> <br>  From the photos taken during the installation of ‚ÄúThe Lamp of Time‚Äù mounted a small <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DEGgjR9Cj2IA%26feature%3Dyoutu.be">music video</a> . <br>  In most frames, you can see what the ‚ÄúLamp‚Äù sees from your post, and the ‚ÄúTime Lamp‚Äù itself can be seen in a couple of initial shots from the side. <br>  1. The distance is 290 meters.  On the frame with the smoke illuminated by the Moon - background purple lights on the verge of the viewing angle.  Olga Pirags calls ‚ÄúThe Lamp of Time‚Äù in the song for some reason an old time clock.  Like a year has not passed ... <br>  2. The distance is 425 meters.  In the words: ‚ÄúHere comes midnight again,‚Äù just below and to the left of the salute cloud, the clock says something about the minutes. <br><br>  <b>Pps</b> <br>  Continuing work on this topic is described at the end of the article " <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/181442/">Do it yourself. City Christmas tree</a> ." <br><br>  Good luck to all! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/135806/">https://habr.com/ru/post/135806/</a></p>
