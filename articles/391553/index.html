And decided to <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/241714/">cut the line by a third</a> .  The Korean company competed simultaneously in several price segments - it fought for the premium with the Apple iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus and for the budget with the Chinese Xiaomi and Huawei. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b95/bfe/e05/b95bfee05f9bbb6fd14587efe8612f99.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  HTC One M9 </h4><br>  March 1, 2015 at <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/mailru/blog/246892/">Mobile World Congress 2015</a> , HTC showed a 5-inch HTC One M9 smartphone with a Fulll HD screen, sales began on April 10 of the same year.  Among the flowers - golden. <br><br>  There is 32 GB of internal memory, 3 GB of RAM, a slot for microSD up to 128 GB, a 20 megapixel main and 4 megapixel front camera.  The smartphone is based on the eight-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 810, Adreno 430 is responsible for the video. <br><br>  Pay attention to the strip on the case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e15/6ba/b9a/e156bab9ac551c21fbafcd35630b2c2d.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b82/e41/c4e/b82e41c4e42973ccbbf962407ad4e1dd.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Separation of the smartphone market by vendor </h4><br>  In August 2015, IDC published this data on the division of the smartphone market by manufacturers.

The company's vice president, Jeff Meredith, began the presentation of Phab Plus by asking how often do we use a telephone for calls?  Personally, I keep the gadget horizontally, because basically I watch TV shows in transport.  Or the smartphone is on the desktop - again horizontally - and shows any videos. <br><br>  The result of the work of the mobile division of Lenovo became Lenovo Phab Plus with a FullHD-display with a diagonal of 6.8 inches.  And it can be called huge - just as several years ago a huge 4.3-inch screen was called.  Friends laugh at me, but as a <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/271480/">recent survey</a> has shown, I am not the only fan of huge screens among users of Geektimes.  And yes, the Phab Plus fits perfectly in a jeans pocket, and it‚Äôs convenient for me to hold it with one hand. <br><br>  What about the characteristics: Phab Plus got a Qualcomm MSM8939 1.5 GHz processor, 2 GB of RAM and 32 GB of constant memory, two SIM slots - you can put a microSD of up to 64 GB in one of them, 13 and 5 megapixel cameras and sound Dolby Atmos technology.  Battery - 3500 mAh.  The phone belongs to the budget - the price at the time of sales was 299 euros. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d45/25a/069/d4525a069bfd300bc7fb0c2c6f31c80f.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ad4/988/404/ad4988404457e6ec4953a2f40668bb06.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  HTC One A9 </h4><br>  On October 20, 2015, HTC officially unveiled the HTC One A9 smartphone on an eight-core ARM 64-bit 1.5 GHz processor.
