Back in April, Google representatives said that in addition to Mac addresses and the SSID accessible to all wireless WiFi identifiers, nothing fell into the hands of the corporation.  They repeated this in the summer, and even a week ago, when Canada began a serious trial on this topic.  As it turned out, not everything is so simple - randomly collected data turned out to be more than just an SSID and Mac addresses.  The corporation has received a rather extensive database of e-mail addresses, logins and passwords to them, plus the addresses of users visited by sites that were viewed by users at the time of passing the Google car.  By the way, the company reported this only today, in the person of Alan Eustace, senior vice president of engineering for Google ( <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/10/creating-stronger-privacy-controls.html">link</a> ).  Thus obtained data so far no one has deleted. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Of course, hardly anyone would suspect that Google is engaged in spying on unsuspecting users.  Rather, it is about negligence, which is unforgivable for a company of this magnitude, like Google.  Collect data from public networks, and store them on your servers - hardly anyone of the users might like it, given the scale of the Google Street project.  And the worst part is that so far all this has been silent - why?  To say that only mac-addresses and identifiers were randomly collected, although in fact they ‚Äúappeared‚Äù and <s>turn-ins, passwords,</s> logins, passwords, website addresses and so on.

      Eustace himself noted that, until now, the corporation simply did not analyze the data collected in detail, which is why everything happened.  In principle, it can also be true - such amounts of data can hardly be processed in a day or two.  By the way, representatives of the Canadian government were the first to report a similar problem, and Google denied the possibility of collecting user passwords and logins, but everything turned out as Canadians said. <br><br>  Nobody began to inflate an elephant from a fly, and the case was closed with a mark ‚Äúunintentional error‚Äù.  Before the Canadians and the French reported that the data collected by the corporation found passwords and logins, plus some other private information. <br><br>  In general, the corporation is currently working to make such situations impossible.  Another senior corporate executive, Alma Witten, promises to introduce a new security program for all corporation projects.  It will happen in December. <br><br>  In general, and the old woman is prorukha, what else can you say.  Hopefully, there will still be less such cases. <br><br>  Via <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13506_3-20020499-17.html">CNET</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/106737/">https://habr.com/ru/post/106737/</a></p>
