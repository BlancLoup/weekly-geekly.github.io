  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Human key graphs</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Not newness for the sake of systematization for.  Everyone knows about the <b>social graph,</b> and this is not surprising - social networks are based on it, the largest of which has recently gained a billion users.  However, the social graph does not solve all problems.  For example, you cannot be sure that in your friend tape you will really read all the relevant materials on topics of interest to you.  Hence the concept <b>of interest graph</b> and services based on it.  What is the sensible <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/129488/">habrastia</a> from <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/karaboz/" class="user_link">karaboz</a> .  In part, I tried to bring the same idea to the <s>absurdity of</s> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/152467/">logical conclusion</a> .  Few people know that in LJ there is an opportunity to read friends only on certain tags in their blogs.  Curiously, the possibility of intersecting the social graph and the graph of interests already existed on such an ancient resource.  In a comment on his <a href="http://www.facebook.com/konstantin.siniushin/posts/288148514629023%3Fref%3Dnotif%26notif_t%3Dshare_reply">status</a> on Facebook, Konstantin Sinyushin said that if you are interested in restaurants and some friends write a review about the restaurant, there is no guarantee that this review is of real value, because  This friend is not necessarily an expert in this field.  In other words, even the intersection of an interest graph with a social graph does not solve all problems. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A problem of this kind can be solved only with the help of the <b>graph of competencies</b> as a set of skills (competencies) associated with a specific person.  I googled and it turned out that the concept of a competence graph exists, although in a completely non-expansive form.  Just a couple of links.  Mikhail Kozharinov from Metavera <a href="http://timepad.ru/about/blog/2012/08/06/sf/">proposes</a> using such a graph to form educational programs for a specific user.  And what he explained in words, in another place is depicted on the example of the <a href="http://www.screeninteraction.com/blog/competency-graph-1-0/">designer‚Äôs competence graph</a> .  Nikita Startsev to write a <a href="http://nicka-startcev.livejournal.com/1893377.html">post</a> about the competence graph was prompted by posts from his friends tape on the topic ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to find a good specialist / doctor around the circle of morons advising cretins.‚Äù <br><br>  Usually, competence coincides with interest, although not always.  You can think of a situation where people are competent in that he is not interested.  I learned accounting, but the soul lies in programming :) Hence, the concept of a <b>graph of psychological dominants</b> (or emotional dominants, as <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/kazabon/" class="user_link">Kazabon</a> would be <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/kazabon/" class="user_link">called</a> ) <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/kazabon/" class="user_link">seems to</a> be.  This is almost astrology, but it would have application when choosing education, in recruiting and in dating services.  Probably in advertising and marketing, too.  In the latter case, the <b>desire graph</b> would also be useful. <br><br>  Probably various information about a person can be drawn not only from his own graphs, but also from their comparison.  It is also likely that I have not listed all useful columns.  Complement.

      <b>Update 10/28/2012 I also</b> thought about the <b>resource graph</b> - certain resources are associated with each person.  Financial, property, social, professional.  This partly overlaps with other graphs, but apparently the resource graph is the most common. <br><br>  <b>Update 23.11.2012</b> This <a href="http://witology.com/4421.html%3Futm_source%3D%25D0%2591%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%2BWitology%26utm_campaign%3Da538d82194-RSS_EMAIL_CAMPAIGN%26utm_medium%3Demail">note</a> about the specifics of corporate social networks prompted the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa <b>goal graph</b> .  It may be close to the desire graph, but the goal is a more ‚Äúrigid‚Äù concept, a specific one.  Let's say there are people who want to learn English.  But this is a rather blurry thing.  For who does not wish it?  Another thing, if we are talking about people who set a goal to learn English. <br><br>  <b>Update 26.11.2012</b> It is possible to conceive the <b>graph of achievements</b> - the greatest achievements of a person in different areas.  Another <b>graph of events</b> .  A certain kind of events that are permissible are capable of uniting groups of people according to non-trivial features.  For example, <s>flew to the moon</s> , visited the sacred mountain Kailash, listened to the album King Krimson, gave birth to a daughter. <br><br>  <b>Addition 21.12.2012</b> <b>Count of consumption</b> .  Probably understandable - a picture of what people used to consume, what goods, services.  Useful for marketing, advertising ... <br><br>  <b>Addition 3.03.2013</b> <b>Geo-graph</b> .  A set of places in which a person lived / lives and who in one way or another considers their home.  In a weaker sense, a list of all places visited.  In another sense, all traditional routes from permanent habitat.  Home, work, shops ... i.e.  This is why it is possible to build a personal rating based on <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/153535/">geo-rating</a> . <br><br>  <b>Update 08/14/2013</b> <b>Internet graph</b>  A set of sites that people constantly use.  The meaning is very similar to a geo graph and you can also build a person‚Äôs rating based on the rating of the sites he visits.  The truth is not sure that the rating of sites in this case coincides with the fact that search engines rank them. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/155279/">https://habr.com/ru/post/155279/</a></p>
