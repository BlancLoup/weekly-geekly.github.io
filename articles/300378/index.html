You obviously made a good impression, and the user is optimistic about your future activity. <br><br>  At this stage, every step you take is crucial for the further development of relationships with users - either this will end in a pitiable ‚Äúbreak‚Äù or a real ‚Äúlove‚Äù.  If you attack the client with a huge stream of irrelevant notifications, you should not be surprised if the situation follows the first scenario.  However, if you consistently and rationally ‚Äúweigh‚Äù every action, you will soon become ‚Äúinseparable‚Äù with the user.

      Of course, in theory everything sounds simple, in practice it is much more complicated.  But each user, one way or another, gives developers certain clues by their behavior inside the application.  It is important to collect, process, analyze and draw conclusions, which will be the basis for the segmentation of the target audience. <br><br>  <b>What is segmentation?</b> <br><br>  Surely anyone who somehow came across marketing and business management, heard about this is not a new concept.  Segmentation is one of the fundamental tactics of marketing.  It divides the general audience into several subgroups of users, which are combined by similar characteristics and behavioral features.  This allows marketers to ‚Äúcommunicate‚Äù with the audience in a language understandable to them and meet the interests of users. <br><br>  By segmenting the audience of your application, even at the simplest level, you recognize the individuality of your users (which many representatives of various business sectors rarely do).  Defining more and more specific characteristics of segments, you open new levels of personalization for sending push notifications. <br><br>  <b>"Underwater rocks"</b> <br><br>  The more criteria for audience segmentation you find, the more it will seem to you that there is no end to this stream of information and it‚Äôs not possible to put everything together. <br><br>  Start with the most obvious, distinct signs to filter users, gradually moving to narrower and more specialized ones.  Solve questions as they become available. <br><br>  <b>Demographics</b> <br><br>  You can start the initial segmentation even before users move to active actions within the application.  You will understand what your customers are and how best to contact them at the stage of their registration in the application.  Such basic demographic indicators as age, gender and location are the ‚Äúrhizome‚Äù of a large tree of a well-developed marketing strategy.  And the stronger and deeper this root system, the greater the chances of a plant to become tall and fruitful. <br><br>  For example, segmentation by location gives you control over the difference in time zones - users will receive notifications not during sleep, respectively, the chances for reading messages are much greater.  In addition, this segmentation gives you an added bonus for setting up geo-targeting. <br><br>  <b>You can also easily find additional features for segmenting users from their personal profiles</b> .  For example, your application is dedicated to some event.  If the user fills in information about the job position, hobbies and hobbies, in the future you will be able to send interesting notifications to him, focusing on these indicators. <br><br>  Another indisputable advantage of demographic segmentation is that they, as a rule, do not change.  The enhanced work on segmentation of the target audience at such an early stage will bring tangible results in the future. <br><br>  <b>Behavioral characteristics</b> <br><br>  After you have carried out the initial segmentation of users and have seen the first positive results of marketing activity, you can gradually move on to a more detailed filtering of users. <br><br>  The longer a client uses your application, the easier it is to analyze his behavioral features.  Of course, the analysis of behavioral models depends on what goals you set during monitoring.  But in general <b>, the analysis can focus on the following indicators:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Follow links </li><li>  Browse pages </li><li>  Audio Video List </li><li>  Comments </li><li>  General user content </li></ul><br><br>  For example, for users who commented on the video artist, it will be relevant to receive notifications with the announcement of his new album.  And those users who have recently searched for fitness services will be more open to receiving notifications advertising healthy food. <br><br>  At this level, the segmentation of the audience of applications is limited only by the framework of your creativity.  However, do not forget about a few <b>‚Äúgolden‚Äù rules for creating and sending push notifications</b> .  Novelty and creativity are always welcome, but not to the detriment of common sense and polite attitude towards the user. <br><br><ul><li>  Treat your users with ‚Äúcare‚Äù </li></ul><br>  Confidential communication of the brand with customers is based on the fact that the user is confident in the benefits of information received from the company.  Appreciate it.  Think over the content of each message; <br><br><ul><li>  Be relevant </li></ul><br>  Create a content plan so that users can regularly receive "fresh", not repeating earlier, original information; <br><br><ul><li>  Be organized </li></ul><br>  Marketing messages such as open-rate, click-rate and many others depend on your messages.  Clearly follow the planned communication strategy, because planning and meeting deadlines is half the success; <br><br><ul><li>  Observe frequency </li></ul><br>  Do not send notifications more than once a week.  Otherwise, there may be a risk of ‚Äúspamming‚Äù the user, which will cause him only one desire - to unsubscribe from notifications or, even worse, to delete the application; <br><br><ul><li>  Surprise and evoke delight! </li></ul><br>  The official app of the Rolling Stones' music band - a successful demonstration of such a slogan.  Their communication strategy includes exclusive content interspersed with fun facts about musicians.  This content application allows customers to feel the special atmosphere of close trust communication and increases user loyalty.  The main thing when adding such a personal ‚Äúnote‚Äù is not to deviate from the general intended tone of communication with the audience. <br><br>  So, we have considered two important issues - the segmentation of the audience and the rules for creating ‚Äúcompetent‚Äù push notifications.  Of course, there is no universal advice or instruction that will work equally well in various business sectors and application topics.  Everything is very individual and specific.  But following our recommendations, you can structure the organization of work and better understand the desires of users.  And this is the main step to success. <br><br>  And what recommendations do you have for organizing marketing activity within applications?
