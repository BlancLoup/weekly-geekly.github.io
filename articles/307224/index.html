  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Fairy, evil corporation and duck. How games are really made. Part 2. Programmer</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Greetings, gentlemen!  Today we will once again look behind the game devil's screen, hiding unwashed, ugly, but sometimes talented creatures, called Indie developers, in order to comprehend the ways of becoming on this slippery path and finally gain so much desired creative independence, whatever that means! <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8b5/2dc/087/8b52dc087a454c07ae4afb7aaf97f172.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#0094d2">1. Fairy</font> </h2><br>  So, where to start this fascinating way, filled with dangerous reefs of the unknown?  And we begin with the fact that we will slowly approach our dusty mirror and look intently who is so wonderful there?  Maybe this is an experienced CJ artist, well, or is there a seasoned C programmer, or maybe it's an Oscar-winning game designer?  If only one of them is worth it, I have sad news for you, because the real indiguru must be universal as the body of Daniel Redcliffe, because he must not depend on anyone, and on anything at all!  He is an INDEPENDENT developer.  Pure freedom is spotless by petty attachments.  No electricity - they drank a small game on asphalt or a shovel in the garden.  And no drugs, this is an addiction! <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ab9/373/709/ab9373709bc34ba184a9cf9c68324f90.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  Well, if it so happened that in the mirror we didn‚Äôt see anyone at all.  There are two options: Either we are vampires, or do not know how to do anything of the above, but Phil Fish appeared to us in a dream in the guise of a fairy and waved his magic wand three times, whispered that since we were all cut into Tanchiki, we simply have to do Phase 2 and the salvation of the entire industry now lies on our sagging shoulders.

An artist without a progera can only saw games in Photoshop, merrily moving the puffers, imitating the gameplay, or practicing black magic in the Game Center.  And the prog?  And a proger can sbatsat a plague hit without a sugary grafon, because the more original and minimalist, the INDIVEE!  Well, if sprites are still needed, then a bunch of hungry artists always run under your feet, take any. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/80f/ad0/ae8/80fad0ae82884e6ca12707f91525eeaa.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br><h2>  <font color="#0094d2">2. Evil Corporation</font> </h2><br>  After a minute of painful self-determination, it's time to start acting.  Sitting all night long, learning the basics of coding through YouTube rollers, in our free time as a welder, is not at all our option.  We want to learn and to pay us some salary.  And, lo and behold!  Our programmer friend just works in a mysterious corporation, which with open arms takes in its insatiable womb new souls, not burdened with pompous professionalism, and ready to work for pennies in the name of pennies and mystical experience of touching the industry they desired.  Perfect place! <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/648/2c9/fd1/6482c9fd166144f9b7e569dda9a0aec1.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  Pretending to be a programmer at a formal interview, we will instantly plunge into the wonderful atmosphere of office slavery, where we will be with you at the very bottom of the hellish conveyor.  Here the games are advertising spam for mobile phones, carpeting the endless expanses of playmarkets.  I installed - I looked at the imposed advertisement - I deleted it.  More games = more money!  What scary?  Have you thought of a game, is it a romance of creative creation?  Not!  And so, in this hellish inferno of Mordor, we will begin to forge our invaluable experience, learning the subtleties of voodoo programming and improving the skill of mastering the art of crutch fu.  Fortunately, the fertile soil is five games a day, generated daily by the insane subconsciousness of the game designer connected to the life support apparatus.  A reliable programmer friend will cover our hunched back in this harsh habitat and give us your invaluable experience, having led through thorns to the stars. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/198/5ab/4ac/1985ab4acac846ec8e81b8d67c65b2b5.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br><h2>  <font color="#0094d2">3. Duck</font> </h2><br>  After hundreds of games created by our callous hands, the reflection suddenly revealed the sloppy features of a real, nervously blinking coffee overload in the programmer's body?  And our familiar hairy artist looms alongside the strange idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmaking a game about duck?  It's a sign!  We finally matured!  It's time!  Urgently we get the second monitor from the authorities, under the cover of production necessity.  Having thrown our game into him, as an indiscriminate, we begin to cut it right at work, under the watchful gaze of unsuspecting minions of evil.  A game about a duck?  Take the finished engine for more powerful and we weld it for a week.  And the more lines of code, the steeper.  And comrades in the workshop, solidary with us, will help in the particularly fierce intricacies of the algorithm. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/927/76c/9c6/92776c9c6e474838a03d9c7e8b82e9f9.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  After a long and persistent indiscabination, we finally have to leave this wonderful forge of personnel and go to our own hearthards to put the last polish on our game, which has already been dragged out for a year, because of the infinitely generated chips that are haphazardly issued by our artist friend.  There, in a warm and cozy atmosphere, to the music of Thomas Bergerson, interspersed with endless quacking of the main character of the game, we will write the last beautiful lines of code.  Which, for the sake of pride, we will definitely show to all our relatives, who do not understand anything about it, in anticipation of praise and approval.  And now, after another half a year, our creation is ready to conquer the Olympuses of Google Play, well, and eplstorov someday. <br><br>  This is exactly how the game ‚ÄúIT'S A DUCK‚Äù was created, which finally fluttered out of its nest to the joy of the ukofil! <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ff4/d5d/bc3/ff4d5dbc3a184454ad672a290e788046.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aBmdmQHz_qI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Look for us in Vkontakte, Litsoknizhkah, well, and we twitter somewhere on Twitter. <br><br>  <b>See also:</b> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/301952/"><b>Bath, children's laptop and duck.</b></a>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/301952/"><b>How games are really made.</b></a>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/301952/"><b>Part 1.
