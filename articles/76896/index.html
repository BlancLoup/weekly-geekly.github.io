  <section class="page js-page"><h1>So that work does not become the enemy: maximum comfort in the workplace with minimum costs</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Yes, I am <s>an old</s> sick person.  Up to 25 years old, the only thing that bothered me in my work was vision that had been damaged by the fourth grade.  But now I find more and more small, but diminishing, problems and problems that could easily have been avoided.  It's a shame that, more often than not, solutions were available - all that was needed was to take care of them in time. <br><br>  <b>This post is devoted to the most relevant aspects of the organization of a ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù workplace of a person whose main tool is a desktop computer, derived, alas, by experience.</b> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1. So, <b>number 1 is the table</b> .  I‚Äôll say right away that he and perhaps the most expensive element in organizing a comfortable workplace.  If you search for special literature, then, most likely, you will read that a table with a height of 73 cm will be optimal for most people.  I do not know exactly what year the researchers last carried out anthropometric measurements, on the basis of which this figure was derived, but for me personally, for comfortable work, as it turned out, I need a table about 77-78 cm tall. <br>  How did I get this figure?  A very simple: put the computer chair to such a height that <br>  a) Legs occupied the most comfortable position under the table;  in practice, this means a thigh-shin angle of about 100 degrees.  An angle of less than 90 degrees during prolonged work leads to impaired blood circulation in the lower legs (=&gt; varicose veins, etc.); an angle of 120 degrees (legs extended) is not always convenient when working. <br>  b) The spine was located straight, without bending forward in the lumbar region.  At the age of 19-20 years, this slouch doesn‚Äôt bother you, but closer to 30, your back starts to hurt, and it hurts so much that it is sometimes hard to fall asleep. <br>  c) At the same time, putting my hands on the keyboard, I have to rest my elbow on the table - it should not hang in the air or, more often, take a position when the shoulders are raised relative to the free position. <br>  So, to occupy such a position, I, with a growth of 179 cm, need a table about 77 centimeters high. <br>  But he must meet several other conditions: <br>  a) The depth of the table should be such that you can freely stretch your legs forward or slightly to the sides.  Otherwise, again, blood stasis. <br>  c) Similarly, the depth of the table top should be such that when the hands are on the keyboard, the elbow fits freely on the table, and all this does not force you to look for a place for the monitor. <br>  And finally, about the place for the monitor: an obligatory element of the table should be a stand under the monitor that lifts it to such a height that its middle or at least top edge of the screen is at the level of your eyes (landing is straight, without slouching).

      2. Number two is a <b>chair</b> .  In principle, I have already written about a comfortable fit above, but now I want to note two points: <br>  a) Back.  It must be regulated tightly.  If there is a backlash, if something has become loose - immediately for repair or replacement. <br>  b) Seat height - it should be optimal (most often, because of the height of the table, the chairs are set lower than they should). <br><br>  3. Number three - <b>orthopedic pillow</b> on the back of the chair.  In Minsk, I managed to find one in only one online store, it costs only $ 27.  It looks like this: <br><br><img src="http://www.nikamed.ru/img_out/article/uploadxYlhIj_middle.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The difference in feelings ‚Äúbefore‚Äù and ‚Äúafter‚Äù was so great that the next day I bought two more: home and in the car.  Low back pain disappeared in a couple of weeks. <br><br>  4. Number four - <b>stand-roller under the keyboard</b> .  It is difficult to say what it is called in Russian, in English it will be wrist rest.  In principle, many good keyboards are already equipped with such a standard.  It contributes to the protection of the hands from pain. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7f2/507/162/7f2507162ae19c56eb1bf71564974c39.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  5. Often forgotten, but important, No. 5 - a <b>humidifier</b> .  I couldn‚Äôt manage to find any universal standard for rooms where people work with computers, but for schools we have a minimum humidity value of 32% - if the air is drier, you cannot work at a computer: you need to open windows and air, put humidifiers etc. <br>  Prices for humidifiers start anywhere from $ 40-45.  You can check the humidity with a household hygrometer - they are often embedded in the souvenir clock, thermometers.  It is especially important to monitor the humidity where they like to turn on the air conditioner for heating: it dries the air very quickly. <br><br><img src="http://www.washbyt.ru/files/imagecache/product_full/SC-983.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  This thing works like this: every N minutes, a club of water dispersed almost to the state of steam escapes from it.  Humidity is adjusted fairly quickly. <br><br>  6. If you use a laptop without an external screen, be sure to get a <b>stand</b> under it.  It costs only $ 15-30 (we can find Canyon and Logitech), often also equipped with a USB hub and an additional cooler.  Must have. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ed2/6b1/380/ed26b1380a760375273d42bec5fe2650.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/76896/">https://habr.com/ru/post/76896/</a></p>
