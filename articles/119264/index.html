And in general, he resisted buying his first mobile phone for quite a long time, considering it to be a temporary fashion.  Now I remember these thoughts with a smile, considering that I am currently engaged in Internet start-ups and I can hardly be called a conservative person. <br><br>  And in the fall of 2008, I got the iPhone 3G.  I don‚Äôt even know how to describe without pathos words that my opinion that such a mobile phone has changed.  Of course, I didn‚Äôt rush to buy it right away, but I still thought about it seriously. <br><br>  In the autumn of the same year, Russian mobile operators announced that they would be selling the iPhone 3G.  As being the subscriber of Megafon and I was always satisfied with this operator in everything, I immediately studied their proposal.

Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt remember all the options, in my case it was a down payment of 7999r and a monthly rental payment of 599r per month for a period of 24 months.  I was also obliged to use the <a href="http://klg.megafon.ru/tariffs/arhiv_tarifov/iphone/tarif_b/">Tariff B RU</a> .  It all suited me perfectly, so the phone was rented. <br><br><h4>  Tariff "For life" </h4><br>  Two and a half years went by as quickly, I already managed to forget that I paid some amount for the rent (the amount of 599 rubles was automatically deducted from the balance each month). <br><br>  I began to use mobile communication even more actively and therefore decided to look at the existing tariffs in order to find the most suitable tariff for me.  This is pretty quickly found. <br><br>  Change the tariff through the service guide failed. <br>  What I told the support service through the site.  Deciding that I would still quickly call and find out what to do, I dialed 0500. The operator, after 10 minutes of deliberation, told me that I needed to contact the service center with a passport, they would check if I had paid the entire rent and change the tariff. <br><br>  The weather was great, why not take a walk.  Pretty girl in the service center checked everything and tried to change the tariff, but there was some kind of hitch.  The girl began to call someone to clarify something. <br>  Then she tried to change the tariff itself through the service guide and naturally nothing happened.  She sympathetically informed me that it was impossible to change the tariff and advised me to buy a new SIM card. <br><br>  Arriving home, I found a letter from the support of Megaphone. <br>  They asked me to clarify the phone number and name.  To which I immediately replied that I was already in the service center and described the situation.  The answer came rather quickly, which stated that ‚ÄúIf you were told at the company's office that there is no possibility to switch from‚Äú In RU ‚Äùtariff plan to another, then it is the way it is.  ‚Äû <br><br>  The current situation seemed to me absolutely absurd.  I got all the documents that I signed when I purchased the phone.  There was found an <b>Annex on the rental of equipment with the subsequent purchase of Telecommunications Services Agreement No. 101</b> , in which only clause 8.7 was included in the tariff change: <br><br>  In the event of early termination of this Annex on the initiative of either party, the Subscriber undertakes to: <br>  - Within 10 (ten) days, to pay the Operator unpaid rental payments at the time of termination, for the entire remaining lease term of the Equipment; <br>  and <br>  - to terminate the communication service agreement or switch to another tariff plan proposed by the Operator, if the Subscriber is not the Operator Subscriber at the time of signing this Appendix.  <b>If the Subscriber at the time of signing the Application was the Subscriber of the Operator, the Operator transfers the Subscriber to the tariff plan, in accordance with which the Subscriber was provided with communication services before the date of signing the Application</b> , or disables the tariff option provided to the Subscriber at the time of signing this Appendix. <br><br>  It is quite difficult to understand the term of its validity from the Application itself and when it can be terminated early.  There is only point 11: The rental period is 21 months. <br><br>  I offered to terminate the Application, to which I was answered: ‚ÄúThank you for the letter.  According to the terms of the tariff plan ‚ÄúIn Uzbekistan‚Äù, the term for charging the redemption value and rent is 24 months.  If the full payment occurred within 24 months (not earlier) by automatically deducting the personal account balance on the 1st day of each month, then the possibility of switching to another tariff is not provided and the Subscriber remains to be serviced on the tariff plan "IN RU".  In the event that the payment was made ahead of schedule, paying the remaining amount in cash at the Company's office, then according to the terms of the Annex to the Communication Services Agreement No. 101, the Operator transfers the Subscriber to the tariff plan, in accordance with which the Subscriber was provided with communication services before the date of signing the Application ( if the Subscriber at the time of signing the Application was the Operator Subscriber). ‚Äù <br><br>  Again, this all sounded unreasonable, but the support in the next letter practically copied its own words. <br><br><h4>  Total </h4><br>  I still have questions about how, without knowing it, I received a lifetime rate.  If it turns out that I no longer can terminate the Application, then the validity period of the Application itself is already over and I am not obliged to fulfill its conditions, including using the tariff plan indicated in it. <br>  I would be grateful for any advice, including "fool himself, you need to read what you are signing" :) <br><br>  In the archive uploaded a copy of the application and correspondence with support. <br>  <a href="http://narod.ru/disk/12867246001/app.rar.html">app.rar</a> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/119264/">https://habr.com/ru/post/119264/</a></p>
