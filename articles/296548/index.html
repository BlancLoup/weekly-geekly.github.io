We would provide communication between people and organizations. <br><br>  Any organization could send us your message.  And people - send a request for information.  And our specialists, like couriers, would deliver it in writing to the addressees. <br><br>  <strong>Your most expensive customer contract?</strong> <br><br>  1.5 million rubles. <br><br>  <strong>Who should not take money for business?</strong> <br><br>  In my opinion, there are no such people or organizations from whom it would not be worthwhile to take money for a business.  It is important to evaluate the risks.  You should not take money only if you do not understand why they are given and what you risk.  It is necessary to anticipate the expectations with which people invest money in your business. <br><br>  <strong>What is your competitor you consider a worthy rival?</strong> <br><br>  For us, rivals in different periods of our development are JivoSite, LiveTex, CallbackHunter.  For example, we develop marketing and understand that number one in the field of flash marketing is CallbackHunter.  If we turn to the development of freemium trends, we look at the dynamics of JivoSite.  In terms of participation in exhibitions and specialized events, we look at LiveTex.  If we talk about the development of a first-class product design, then we focus on foreign LiveChatInc.  Competitors - this is a great opportunity to compete with someone when you want to fight.  And the team often needs it.  In my opinion, it is important to choose competitors in the part where they are strong, and try to be rivals there. <br><br>  <strong>Have you ever ...?</strong> <br><br>  We never envied competitors.  We always have the feeling that we can "break" them. <br><br>  <strong>The least you can do to get your service to start bothering a customer?</strong> <br><br>  Set the default settings, like competitors.  Initially, we created RedConnect as a service that should not bother the client.  We understand that chats and callbacks are terribly furious.  Therefore, we have worked out such a concept so that there is a conversion into a perfect action, but at the same time the service is not annoying. <br><br>  <strong>How many employees were willing to work with you for free at the start?</strong> <br><br>  Free people never work.  There are people who work for a salary and this is normal, but there are those who are passionate about the team and the process.  Everyone needs motivation.  It can be expressed in money, and maybe in something else.  A sales manager, for example, will not work without money.  But many professionals work for the future. <br><br>  <strong>How much time a day do you spend on social networks?</strong> <br><br>  In our company, we did the SocialRang project - monitoring the presence of employees on social networks: collecting data, creating charts, analyzing content and giving out information that someone from managers, for example, did not post about working on Facebook.  What was important was not the time spent on social networks, but the patterns of behavior. <br><br>  I can say that programmers practically do not sit in social networks.  Our technical director is there once a week when someone needs to write.  Other employees devote to social networks for about an hour a day.  And this is not necessarily viewing public and pictures - many use social networks as a music player. <br><br>  For me, Facebook is a business social network for work contracts, and VKontakte is music. <br><br>  <strong>Do you want your company to buy ...?</strong> <br><br>  We dream that Google will offer us - we want to develop technology in such a way as to be interesting for large players.  But this does not mean that we will sell the company. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296548/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296548/</a></p>
