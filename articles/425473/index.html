  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Conference about Python and about communication</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Traditionally, Python is used to create network services, backends on the web and, of course, to collect and process data, usually Large.  We will try to discuss these areas in equal shares with ecosystem reports at the upcoming Moscow Python Conf ++.  This conference for Python developers will be held in Moscow on October 22 and 23, and I head its Program Committee.  The program, it can be said, has been won over, we managed to make it exactly as we planned - diverse.  Backend, Big Data and language features, we harmoniously combine with reports on testing, artificial intelligence, security and DevOps.  I would like to share the result with you in advance, so I suggest reviewing the reports in sections - something that doesn‚Äôt apply to you, you can skip. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ch/et/pp/chetppwrojelci0xb4nsxivbwdm.jpeg"><br><br>  Although, wait, do not rush to jump on the next topic.  The picture above says: "Professional Conference" - that is, it is intended for professional developers.  But as guests, we see not only the actual Python-developers, but also programmers, mostly using a different stack, but interested in the capabilities of Python for auxiliary tasks.  The last should come reports, for example, about Apache Kafka, Wagtail, SQLAlchemy or linters. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  All reports will be structured in such a way that it will be possible to penetrate without even understanding the specific topic of the speech, thereby broadening your horizons, but at the same time the pros will be able to get to the most intricate problems.  It is conditionally possible to distinguish three blocks of topics and "different":

It is understood that the speaker sets an interesting topic, tells his vision, shares his experience, offers to discuss possible approaches to his colleagues.  This all means that if you manage to suppress your own introversion and use all the possibilities to the maximum, then after the conference you will be full of new ideas and ways to solve old problems.  What problems will be discussed, read on. <br><a name="1"></a><br><h2>  Web, backend and web development </h2><br>  We begin the review with a serious and fairly universal section, which includes almost a third of all reports. <br><br><h3>  High Performance Data Processing in Python <br></h3><br>  Python is currently the main tool for converting large, unstructured data.  <strong>Numpy</strong> and <strong>numba are</strong> popular libraries, but when working with them it‚Äôs easy for a developer to fall into a trap and lose all performance.  <strong>Donald Whyte</strong> (Engineers Gate) will <a href="https://conf.python.ru/2018/abstracts/3900">explain</a> how numpy / numba work under the hood and how they use vectorization to quickly process large amounts of data.  Donald made it possible for these tools to speed up scientific calculations <strong>10 or more times</strong> , it would be very useful to learn from his experience. <br><br><h3>  Experience using Apache Kafka in World of Tanks <br></h3><br>  <strong>Levon Avakian</strong> in his <a href="https://conf.python.ru/2018/abstracts/3848">report</a> will tell how Apache Kafka is used in Wargaming projects, what difficulties arise in this connection and how to overcome them.  It is also no secret that in the company Wargaming, Python is widely used for development.  Levon will share the experience of using various libraries for <strong>Apache Kafka in Python</strong> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rz/kc/rc/rzkcrc0rskwpdan9jnyqskgqlrc.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  Wagtail: when you want something nicer than just Django <br></h3><br>  In the world of PHP development, there is WordPress, on which almost anyone can make a simple site, and connect a specialist later when you need to expand this site.  Until recently, nothing happened in the world of Python.  But now the <strong>Wagtail</strong> project has <strong>emerged - a full-featured Django-based CMS</strong> for modern websites.  <strong>Igor Mosyagin</strong> from Lamoda <a href="https://conf.python.ru/2018/abstracts/4304">will tell you</a> how Wagtail works, where it is convenient to use it, and whether it really is that simple. <br><br><h3>  Django under microscope <br></h3><br>  From the <a href="https://conf.python.ru/2018/abstracts/3911">report</a> by <strong>Artem Malyshev,</strong> developer of Django Channels developer (already familiar to us, for example, from this <a href="https://habr.com/company/oleg-bunin/blog/418445/">speech</a> ), you will learn all the details of the life of the internal Django mechanisms <strong>from the first byte of the HTTP request to the last byte of the response</strong> . <br><br>  A real extravaganza awaits you on how the parser-forms work, how SQL is compiled, how the HTML template is implemented, how the connection pool is managed, etc.  All this in chronological order of processing WSGI objects. <br><br><h3>  Beyond Jupyter.  Data Processing Pipeline Systems <br></h3><br>  <strong>Andrey Popov</strong> will tell you what frameworks for Python are used in Positive Technologies to collect a <strong>huge amount of data</strong> and analyze them for threats.  And the <a href="https://conf.python.ru/2018/abstracts/3960">report</a> will focus on how to correctly collect this data, and store them in a form convenient for different teams in the company.  But besides this, we will touch on such questions: <br><br><ul><li>  When it is appropriate to use celery / rabbit, and when it is better to build a dateline. </li><li>  Comparing <strong>Airflow and Luigi</strong> . </li><li>  Luigi 101 - the basic concepts and examples of their use. </li></ul><br>  As a result, we can figure out which technology to choose in a particular case, and how it will look in the code. <br><br><h3>  History update project architecture <br></h3><br>  <strong>Alexander Borgardt</strong> <a href="https://conf.python.ru/2018/abstracts/3896">will share a</a> fairly non-trivial evolutionary history of a single project.  It began on the tornado, then to improve the driving characteristics of the part was rewritten in C ++.  Then came 2018, and it turned out that <strong>now many old hacks are not needed</strong> .  A bunch of asyncio + uvloop + aiohttp will most often give performance no worse.  It is about this case on a specific example, with clear recommendations, and let's talk on the report of Alexander. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ec/f3/gs/ecf3gsbut0pk1zlkbbeeltqp8kw.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  50 shades of celery <br></h3><br>  <strong>Oleg Churkin</strong> has been developing in Python for 8 years and now plays the role of a techlide in TechOps, a Fintech startup.  When we say finteh, we mean - <strong>Big data</strong> .  From Oleg's <a href="https://conf.python.ru/2018/abstracts/4055">report,</a> we learn about the intricacies of using <strong>Celery scheduler</strong> for processing big data: <br><br><ul><li>  for which types of tasks Celery can and should be used; </li><li>  how to run <strong>500 thousand tasks</strong> and leave the database and external services alive; </li><li>  how to monitor task performance; </li><li>  how not to lose the task in case of delay; </li><li>  how to write supported task code. </li></ul><br>  And let's consider the author's libraries, which allow to successfully scale Celery and monitor queues / tasks in Grafana and Prometheus.  Maybe you've already seen some spoilers <a href="https://habr.com/company/oleg-bunin/blog/425719/">here</a> . <br><a name="2"></a><br><h2>  Python language, its evolution and use </h2><br>  Before you go to your beloved Python, I note that the conference program is such that any guest could choose an interesting case, listen to the speaker and, most importantly, talk with all those people who came to the same report. <br><br><blockquote>  <strong><em>Social cheat.</em></strong>  The more important the subject of the report to you, the closer to the scene it makes sense to sit down.  First, it will be more convenient to ask questions to the speaker.  Secondly, other interested specialists will do the same, you will be able to discuss the presentation with them and smoothly continue the discussion during the coffee break. <br></blockquote><br>  Let me remind you that the conference, in my opinion, is about communication, and you should not neglect this opportunity. <br><br><h3>  Upgrade Python 2.7 to Python 3.6 and not die <br></h3><br>  Evolution is a natural phenomenon.  Python is also not spared, but some projects still use Python 2.7 for one simple reason - due to the <strong>complexity of migrating between versions</strong> .  <strong>Alexander Polishchuk</strong> (Security Code) offers to <a href="https://conf.python.ru/2018/abstracts/4152">share</a> his thorny expensive update.  From the report we learn about the rake and stuffed cones, and by living example, we realize that the result, of course, is worth it. <br><br><h3>  Holivary report about the linter <br></h3><br>  <strong>Nikita Sobolev, the</strong> founder of the studio wemake.services, spoke not on one of our meetings and is already well known to you.  We managed to lure Nikita to record the <a href="https://youtu.be/WQWRDWOS-qs">Python Junior</a> podcast, during which the application for the report was created. <br><br>  As the <a href="https://conf.python.ru/2018/abstracts/4150">name implies</a> , this time it will be <strong>about automated verification of</strong> Python <strong>code</strong> .  This linter was developed right in the studio of Nikita, that is, we will have the opportunity to ask the developer of the tool directly.  In addition, the <strong>interactive is</strong> promised, which means it will be not only informative, but also entertaining. <br><br><h3>  How to teach people programming and enjoy life <br></h3><br>  Lecturer chores mutteringly, explaining the term written on the blackboard.  Your neighbor is drawing something on the desk.  Only the need to write down every word of the lecturer saves you from sleep.  Familiar?  Unfortunately, the learning process has not changed much.  Boring lectures turned into boring webinars, boring tests turned into boring online tests, boring tasks turned into boring and useless tasks. <br><br>  Ilya Lebedev is an experienced Python developer, creator of the devman.org learning platform.  As a co-organizer, MoscowPython has been developing and teaching at <a href="https://learn.python.ru/">learn.python.ru</a> for several years.  In his report, Ilya will raise the issue of education of programmers, with whom everything is not very much.  Moreover, in general.  The simple way of hiring juniors from graduates of a particular university, faculty or specialty does not work.  Ilya, based on his experience, will try <a href="https://conf.python.ru/2018/abstracts/4311">to explain</a> what difficulties arise when learning how to develop, and will give advice on what to do in order to improve his skills and help make this a subordinate. <br><br><h3>  Refactoring in Python: design patterns <br></h3><br>  <strong>Tin Markoviƒá</strong> from Kiwi.com (Czech Republic) <a href="https://conf.python.ru/2018/abstracts/4282">will share the</a> experience of organizing a <strong>huge amount of extremely complex</strong> Python <strong>code</strong> .  How to put things in order, how to update the code, not allowing a new mess to develop, and generally <strong>adhere to high standards</strong> in the code base.  All this is how we love with real examples and personal experience. <br><br><h3>  Pylint from the inside.  How he does it <br></h3><br>  <strong>Maxim Mazaev</strong> develops in Python in TSIAN, is interested in the internal of the language, asynchrony and functional programming.  His <a href="https://conf.python.ru/2018/abstracts/4285">report has</a> something in common with Nikita Sobolev‚Äôs report <a href="https://conf.python.ru/2018/abstracts/4150">about linters</a> , but will be focused on one main tool, in which <strong>we will thoroughly understand</strong> .  Armed with this knowledge, apply it in the name of improving the quality of the code - <strong>we will write our own plugin for Pylint</strong> . <br><br><h3>  Creating DSL compilers in Python <br></h3><br>  The use of small <strong>programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãfor individual subject areas</strong> (DSL) allows you to deal with the complexity of software systems when you need it.  As a consequence, there arises the problem of rapid prototyping of DSL compilers.  For example, before <strong>Peter Sovetov</strong> of MIREA, this task arose in the context of speeding up the process of developing specialized <strong>processor cores on FPGAs</strong> .  Peter <a href="https://conf.python.ru/2018/abstracts/4295">will tell</a> about the stages and impressive results of work at Moscow Python Conf ++. <br><br><h3>  Common Errors in Django Application Architecture <br></h3><br>  <strong>Alexei Polovinkin</strong> from Agima sets the ambitious goal of the <a href="https://conf.python.ru/2018/abstracts/4281">report</a> - to show backend development teams how to build the architecture of Django applications, how not to stumble over a hundred pitfalls and not overdue all deadlines.  Consider the examples of the <strong>most frequent mistakes of</strong> teams at the initial stage of development.  Discuss how to design a Django application architecture, why <strong>use a distributed architecture,</strong> and keep statics away from Django.  Let's forget about <strong>refactoring</strong> , we will touch on many important issues, get acquainted with the experience of Agima developers. <br><a name="3"></a><br><h2>  Machine learning, artificial intelligence and data visualization <br></h2><br>  Machine learning and Python are a strong associative pair.  And, of course, Moscow Python Conf ++ will not do without reports about everything about it. <br><br><h3>  How to implement modern ML in the harsh legacy <br></h3><br>  When it comes to automation of ML-models, most often it means, firstly, new projects, secondly, Jupyter and some environment around it.  This approach is not suitable for the analytics system in the bank, where, as a rule, there is a lot of legacy. <br><br>  However, Oleg Mangutov managed to make friends with modern Machine Learning with the environment, where Oracle and SOAP are running, with the help of a universal glue - Python.  The main conclusion of this <a href="http://ttps//conf.python.ru/2018/abstracts/4297">report</a> , in my opinion, is that an ordinary developer, with due diligence, can introduce machine learning algorithms into existing projects without rewriting everything from scratch and not thoroughly studying how Oracle works.  And the benefit of this can be a colossal one; live business users will be able to use the developed interface. <br><br><h3>  Theory of Neural Networks <br></h3><br>  <strong>Beau Carnes</strong> has extensive experience in teaching on IT topics and is currently preparing a new course in deep learning.  His report will be divided into two parts (lunch in the middle for the digestion of knowledge).  In the first part of the <a href="https://conf.python.ru/2018/abstracts/4258">report</a> we will touch on basic concepts: training with and without a teacher;  neural networks for prediction;  gradient descent.  Let us discuss <strong>how deep learning methods</strong> differ from traditional machine learning methods, and deal with them, not limited to frameworks. <br><br>  In the second part of the speech, we are waiting for <strong>live-coding</strong> in Jupyter Notebook.  Bo, on the move in pure Python from scratch, will create a neural network that learns and recognizes ... but you will recognize what it recognizes on October 22. <br><br><h3>  How to protect machine learning algorithm from adversarial examples <br></h3><br>  When we use public data for machine learning, we have to expect that they will be complete and clean.  However, as is easy to see from the example of Google translator, the data may look like correct, and in fact, instead of a correct translation, teach the system unexpected interpretations.  This is one of the variations of the adversarial example. <br><br>  <strong>Sergey Dudorov, a</strong> specialist in data analysis from Digital Security, will <a href="https://conf.python.ru/2018/abstracts/4055">acquaint</a> us in detail with this problem, will talk about the methods of attack, protection and testing of machine learning algorithms to counter such manipulations using the <strong>CleverHans</strong> and <strong>Adversarial-robustness-toolbox libraries</strong> . <br><br><h3>  Python Virtual Assistant <br></h3><br>  <strong>Oleg Plichko</strong> promises to demonstrate that you can create a <strong>chat bot with artificial intelligence</strong> using common tools: TensorFlow, Celery, Django.  From the <a href="https://conf.python.ru/2018/abstracts/4300">report</a> we will learn how to make our virtual assistant really useful, and see an example of one very interesting chat bot that many of us may find useful in the future.  We will be able to ask Oleg all our questions about bots and cognitive services. <br><br><h3>  Jupyter and PySpark on Hadoop for big data analysis <br></h3><br>  Machine learning is a new, fast-growing area, there are still not many established practices.  Therefore, every data scientist puts a lot of experimentation and wants to do it quickly.  It is good if these are simple type hypotheses, are there enough data and are they correct?  And what if you need to apply a complex samopisny function to a large number of objects?  In addition, all tasks must be solved on a production cluster, where 50 more people work. <br><br>  <strong>Pavel Tarasov</strong> <a href="https://conf.python.ru/2018/abstracts/4296">will tell</a> how to really quickly test complex hypotheses using the minimum number of tools and code.  Jupyter and PySpark in this case is something from which you can assemble a stand, and not spend a week preparing the environment, as often happens with big data, because they are Big. <br><br><blockquote>  The conference will be held in Inforspraste, a small hall will be allocated for user-generated content.  That is, mitapas, which can be collected by anyone, the main thing is to find like-minded people.  You can organize yourself on the spot, but if you <a href="https://conf.python.ru/2018/meetups">book</a> in advance, you will be included in the schedule. <br></blockquote><br><a name="4"></a><h2>  Miscellaneous: testing, security, DevOps </h2><br>  Further reports are single, they are not included in large sections, but they solve the set task of diversity.  Themes, by the way, are very important and interesting, one of which is social engineering, or here is the ‚Äúhacking guide‚Äù. <br><br><h3>  A Hacker's Guide to Securing Python Web Applications <br></h3><br>  I hope that your web projects have never been attacked and have not been hacked, but most likely someone you know has come across their sad consequences.  Our colleague, one of the organizers of PyCon Nigeria, <strong>Eyitemi Egbejule,</strong> <a href="https://conf.python.ru/2018/abstracts/4308">claims</a> that, armed with safe coding practices and some useful libraries, you can <strong>forget about vulnerabilities</strong> in Python web applications <strong>forever</strong> .  Relying on <strong>extensive experience in auditing the security of web projects, Eyitemi</strong> will tell you which errors are most often made by network services developers, where to look for vulnerabilities in the first place, and which ones are the fastest to close.  It will not necessarily be software, problems may be in the logic or in the use of common, but incorrect default settings. <br><br>  We hope that this report will allow developers to take a fresh look at their code, and even, perhaps, start applying the tips right there at the conference. <br><br><h3>  Efficient Selenium Infrastructure <br></h3><br>  Do you use Selenium for automatic testing, but are tired of fighting its brakes and crashes?  Then a <a href="https://conf.python.ru/2018/abstracts/3895">master class by</a> <strong>Ivan Krutov</strong> (Aerokube) on the effective infrastructure of Selenium is for you. <br><br>  At the master class, Ivan promises to show how to deploy a Selenium cluster based on the <strong>Selenoid and Ggr</strong> opensource projects in a few simple steps, allowing you to replace the outdated Selenium Grid and stop tormenting Selenium.  You will see how easy it is to record video of executing tests, add new versions of browsers and watch logs in real time. <br><br>  It turned out that there was so much material that this master class would take two hours on October 23 - before and after lunch, in time for me to carefully think everything over. <br><br><h3>  Dark Python: Social engineering and hacking with 70% success rate <br></h3><br>  If you believe the most reliable source of information - the movie, then hackers instead of the console now use <strong>methods of social engineering</strong> .  <strong>Lukas Hurych</strong> from Twisto.cz as a hobby is trying out various ways of attacking his colleagues.  The results are staggering - 70% success.  And our Python plays an important role in automating this process. <br><br>  Lucas will help you <a href="https://conf.python.ru/2018/abstracts/4168">know</a> what the enemy looks like and what methods are most common and effective, so that we can defend against them in our backend and UX. <br><br><h3>  Accelerate SQLAlchemy for architectural astronauts <br></h3><br>  A huge advantage of SQLAlchemy is that this is a <strong>very common ORM</strong> and one of the best solutions for communicating with a database in a high-level language.  But sometimes this convenience can sometimes turn out to be unexpected.  Obviously, this convenience can sometimes turn out to be unexpected.  <strong>Alexey Starkov</strong> from Qrator Labs on the example of the network configuration of traffic filtering with a large (hundreds of thousands) number of records <a href="https://conf.python.ru/2018/abstracts/3937">will show</a> how <strong>to achieve high performance</strong> .  To do this, you need to move from the most naive use of SQLAlchemy ORM to bulk-operations and the use of <strong>SQLAlchemy Core</strong> , and the details are October 23 at 16:00. <br><br><h3>  Good and bad practices for writing test code <br></h3><br>  In his report, <strong>Dmitry Dygalo</strong> from kiwi.com is going to <a href="https://conf.python.ru/2018/abstracts/4314">discuss</a> approaches that will help <strong>make the code more understandable</strong> , reliable and testable.  Let's talk about a variety of problems and get specific advice, for example, that global variables are a convenient concept, which is often not used where it should be.  How to find a compromise between isolation and speed in a test database.  On <strong>dependency injection</strong> and separation of execution from implementation with examples from popular libraries.  And surely this is not all. <br><br>  It seems that this is more than enough to get an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat will be at the conference.  For the work on the program I want to thank all the members of the Program Committee: Vladimir Filonov, Zlata Obukhovskaya, <a href="https://habr.com/users/allexx/">Alexander Hayorov</a> a, <a href="https://habr.com/users/Tsyganov_Ivan/">Ivan Tsyganov</a> a, Leonid Kalneusa. <br><br>  Through complex logical operations, we have already placed all the reports in a harmonious <a href="https://conf.python.ru/2018/schedule.html">schedule</a> ( <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/a0w6o3kk6vzfny1/%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5%2520mpc%25202018.pdf%3Fdl%3D0">here pdf</a> with visualization by topic).  It turned out that we conceived, starting preparations for the conference six months ago: the topics are distributed across all the varieties of using Python, a reasonable number of English-speaking speakers have something to talk about over a cup of coffee and a glass of beer on aftapati. <br><br><blockquote>  See you at <a href="https://conf.python.ru/2018">Moscow Python Conf ++ 2018</a> ! <br></blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/425473/">https://habr.com/ru/post/425473/</a></p>
