Roskosmos, as the creator, and Roshydromet, as a user of the Electro-L satellite, responded to our <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/178629/">request</a> , changed the mode of operation of the spacecraft and removed the solar eclipse in Australia. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/407/72d/630/40772d630a2d1367162070a6ce4b8fad.jpg"><br><br>  It seems no one believed that it was real - to persuade Roscosmos to do something similar for ordinary Internet users.  I myself believed that it would be more difficult than asking NASA to take a picture of Mars, and hoped for success, but, frankly, did not believe.  But it happened!  At once, two scientific groups prepared for us the results of a night satellite survey.  During the Australian eclipse at the space station, reinforced shifts were on duty, and this was the night after the May 9 holiday.  Ready photos on <a href="http://www.ntsomz.ru/electro/source_images">open FTP were</a> downloaded twice as fast as with regular work.  And there were not three pictures, as RIA-Novosti mistakenly <a href="http://ria.ru/science/20130508/936517071.html">wrote</a> , but seven - every 15 minutes, starting at 0:55.  There was even one ten-minute interval.

      ( <i>Under the cat gifs 5 mb</i> ) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I will remind a little: <br><br>  The annular solar eclipse on May 10, 2013 initially passed through the territory of Australia.  This site was in the field of view of the Russian meteorological satellite Electro-L, which is located at one permanent point in the geostationary orbit. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/28a/9ab/2b1/28a9ab2b162121db427f746c9c70d4f5.jpg"><br>  <i>Map by Michael Zeiler</i> <br><br>  The spacecraft removes the surface of the Earth once every 30 minutes for the past two years.  We asked Roscosmos to double the shooting speed at the time of the eclipse.  And, surprisingly, it was done. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0d1/3cc/6fa/0d13cc6fafcb2fbe5f8f38d979734b03.gif"><br>  <i>Animation created by the scientific group of the <a href="http://planet.iitp.ru/elektro/elektro_eclipse.htm">SRC "Planet</a> "</i> ( <a href="">Large size 6 mb</a> ) <br><br>  But, of course, in this case, the pictures - not the most important thing.  The main goal of our request is to show Roskosmos and, in general, Russian science and cosmonautics officials that the Internet is an important and useful tool for communicating with citizens of the country, for which, ultimately, all science is done.  And we, as ordinary Internet users, want us to share with us more actively the successes in the exploration of outer space, the exploration of the Universe, and more often go to dialogue.  I think, at least partially, this goal has been achieved.  Therefore, now, we can enjoy the fruits of our efforts and admire the moon shadow running across Australia, which Electro-L shot at twice the frequency, because we just asked for it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ede/e2c/f54/edee2cf54edb877ac236f8990d7d685b.gif"><br>  <i>Animation created by the scientific group <a href="http://www.ntsomz.ru/news/news_center/soln_zatm_100513">NTs OMZ</a></i> <br><br>  The process of deciding how to change the operation of the satellite was not easy.  The work of the spacecraft is planned for a month, so <a href="http://vk.com/wall-49107082_1165">our request</a> , set out a week before the event, and even on holidays, was clearly out of date.  Unfortunately, I still can‚Äôt list all the people who called, wrote official and unofficial letters, convinced, requested, offered ... Many and many employees of the NT OMZ, NPO named after S.A.  Lavochkina, Planet Research and Development Center, even the SAIU of Moscow State University, Electro-L Municipal Unitary Enterprise, and perhaps even some other organizations, helped bring our request to the very top of the administrative ladder and convince the authorities that this was a necessary thing, and then implement it.  I will try to learn about the contribution of each participant of this difficult process, and to tell about these "fighters of the invisible space front", if, of course, they do not mind.  I think it will turn out a detective story worse than the search for Mars-3. <br><br>  I also tried my hand at image processing: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ad5/3a3/0c1/ad53a30c197b5a4222c6dc4a79314910.gif"><br><br>  Well, and, of course, the wallpaper on the desktop - the one that at the beginning of the text <a href="">1940x1200</a> , <a href="">1940x1080</a> . <br><br>  PS Probably, this record will be seen by many of those who made the impossible possible, therefore it is appropriate here to tell them many thanks. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/179217/">https://habr.com/ru/post/179217/</a></p>
