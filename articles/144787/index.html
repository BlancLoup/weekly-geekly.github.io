  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Visa Electron and Maestro in e-commerce. First results</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  According to the data for 2011, more than 160 million bank plastic cards were issued in Russia.  At the same time, the increase in the number of issued cards is about 10-15% per year.  If we proceed from the statistics on the number of residents of Russia, it turns out that each has on average more than one card.  According to the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, more than 50% of all issued cards are active, that is, with the help of which at least one operation was performed per year. <br>  If we talk about possible ways to use bank cards, now there are about 170 thousand card servicing devices in Russia, of which 130 thousand are ATMs, and more than 40 thousand are terminals for ground-based acquiring.  There are not so many international payment systems, licenses for issuing cards of which were received by Russian banks.  These are Visa, MasterCard, Diners Club and American Express.  The most popular payment systems are Visa, which occupies more than 53% of the market, and MasterCard, with 34% of the market. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Throughout the history of issuing bank cards in Russia, the main issue was accounted for payroll projects, the issuance of cards for which implies the simplest and cheapest in both issuing and servicing the card: Visa Electron and Maestro.  At the same time, the most popular method of using cards is still withdrawing cash at an ATM twice a month. <br>  Until recently, the use of Visa Electron and Maestro cards when paying for goods or services online was not allowed by issuing banks.  What was associated with limited functionality (for example, the lack of a CVV code) and the lack of interest of banks in the Internet acquiring of these types of cards.  The development of e-commerce has led to the fact that many banks, issuers are now allowed to use these cards to pay online. <br>  According to statistics from PayU for March - May 2012, the number of transactions using bank cards is growing, with the fastest relative growth being observed with Visa Electron cards.  During this period, the number of transactions leads Visa and MasterCard, while the payment to the Internet using Visa Electron is steadily growing, reaching 12%.  This dynamic suggests that more and more issuing banks are interested in using simple bank cards, such as Visa Electron and Maestro, not only as a ‚Äúwallet‚Äù for receiving payroll or pension money, but also as a method of payment. <br><br><img src="http://www.payu.ru/sites/russia/files/pictures/tpv.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://www.payu.ru/sites/russia/files/pictures/transactions.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Statistics on the average check for the same period shows that the average check on the Visa card and MasterCard are almost equal.  The price of an average purchase using Visa Electron and Maestro is 35% less.  These statistics indicate that people who own simple cards are usually not advanced Internet users and so far do not fully trust online payments. <br><img src="http://www.payu.ru/sites/russia/files/pictures/av_bill.jpg" alt="image"></div>
