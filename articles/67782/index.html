That is - to invent great ?! <br><br>  The arguments are written as an answer to the topic, did not alter.  Who doesn‚Äôt like it - pass by, <s>this is a personal blog</s> , this is a blog learn to work, so it‚Äôs not a mistake - only the one who does nothing, and once again, these are simple first-person reasonings ...

      Who cares, welcome, for those who are smart - goodbye, good luck, and happiness, because clever to teach, just spoil ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So: <br><br>  Gosh, man!  Do you have a lot of time?  Let's do business together!  Let's write something interesting and not complicated and become popular!  You do not believe in this?  You want to prove on your fingers that the ‚Äúsuch‚Äù is full, for example, I needed a forum that can be easily reversed, the main conditions: free, simple, and built on simple templates, yesterday I shoveled about 15 forums, just like that, I went to hotscripts -&gt; boards and go, I was shocked! <br><br>  Either something like <a href="http://a.imagehost.org/view/0332/vanilla"><img src="http://a.imagehost.org/t/0332/vanilla.jpg" width="150" height="82" alt="vanilla.png (54 KB)"></a>  variation 2 <a href="http://a.imagehost.org/view/0200/smf"><img src="http://a.imagehost.org/t/0200/smf.jpg" width="150" height="94" alt="smf.png (60 KB)"></a>  that is, if I don't have tables but my divas, then I need to shovel all echo !!!  and finally "simple" phpbb 3 - what you need!  "Total" 98 files, probably have to redo a week <a href="http://a.imagehost.org/view/0606/phpbb"><img src="http://a.imagehost.org/t/0606/phpbb.jpg" width="150" height="141" alt="phpbb.png (33 KB)"></a> <br><br>  Well, okay, I need something simple, I will try to <b>write it myself</b> in a week, I‚Äôll take <s>Kohana-Kodaygier</s> Kohana and write <s>Nakalaputska</s> (and I wanted to get rid of the customer in a day) okay, a week - so a week. <br><br>  Do you want to write a disinterested and free "nonsense"?  Lada, let's write for sale, I have a HUGE MARKET (the fact is that I have been working for 9 years in Jordan, and you won‚Äôt believe, it's just a Klondike, for those who cut the theme, who could understand the "mysterious Arab soul" ).  At least doing, for them, scripts, adapted to the Arabic language. <br><br>  So, from my own experience, at leisure, in the form of hack-work, I install ready-made scripts for the ‚Äúpeople‚Äù, now, if not strange, mostly fashion for news scripts, I usually give them something like ‚Äúvivvo cms‚Äù, even without changing the standard themes, here's an example: kfpnp.net tajnews.com <br>  <i>(although sometimes I lose the day for adaptation, one needs a running line, another needs news in a row with photos, etc.)</i> <br><br>  And here is another example, there is a dude from the "gas sector" (do you know where it is and what is it?), Who wrote a shit script based on shit code, although it may be talented?  Maybe I'm a fool?  Here is the first file: <a href="http://a.imagehost.org/view/0066/velikolepie"><img src="http://a.imagehost.org/t/0066/velikolepie.jpg" width="150" height="114" alt="velikolepie.png (64 KB)"></a>  Where did I get his code, since "cis" closed and "commercial"?  And very simply, I went to the third link on Google (search for his name "developer") and you won‚Äôt believe ... found a <a href="http://test.ct-eg.com/">ready-packed archive</a> with his masterpiece !!!  (distracted) <br><br>  So this ‚Äúmasterpiece‚Äù is different, like hot cakes, here are just the first links from Google: amad.ps alsdaqa.com fpnp.name iafhr.org koctail.com, each has its own script, it pushes an average of 2 Euros.  Little?  As for me, so for once written shit - great! <br><br>  And what is the reason for success?  And in that he made the system for ‚Äúidiots‚Äù (he himself was), there in the admin panel (very similar to the vbullitein admin panel, everything is very simple and stupid, a <b>huge</b> plus, that everything is in Arabic, and local aksakals do not need to break head off thinking what, different post from send. <br><br>  <i>Of course, you have the right to ask, since you are so clever, did you not do something like that yourself for a long time?</i>  <i>the answer to the banal is simple, I am old, my mother lives with me + my wife + a bunch of children (girls), take them - bring them from school, buy groceries, take them to the thread, etc.</i>  <i>Working time I kill more on the coordination of affairs, travel, "knocking out" money, search for new customers than on coding itself.</i>  <i>Besides, I'm alone!</i>  <i>My classmates on KPI, everything in a row, somehow became, ‚Äúsuddenly‚Äù mened, all mathematicians ‚Äî suddenly became anyone ‚Äî but not programmers !!!</i>  <i>And here with programmers in general - trouble!</i>  <i>Even in contrast to <s>Artemy Tatiana</s> , I don‚Äôt keep a diary, I don‚Äôt smear everyone around, I don‚Äôt drown in shit, there is no careerism, ambition and selfishness too, there are friends, but for some reason (it happened) all doctors !!!</i>  <i>(even pain! But as luck would have it, with health as long as pah-pah-pah) But this is already the lyrics ...</i> <br><br><h4>  Back to our sheep. </h4><br>  The need for an elementary set (scripts) for the Middle East is <b>huge</b> , so here are the vbullitein forums and I sold the scripts to the Saudis more than all over the world!  Or let's say the exact same vivvo, they even have an Arabic template in the standard set, plus almost all the plugins work right to left !!!  :))) <br><br>  Do you want a script?  Do you want a social program that captures a quarter of the world? <br>  Come on!  - All is thought up for a long time!  Paul Facebook is Arabs (I don‚Äôt know for sure, but it‚Äôs a lot of it, it‚Äôs popular, it was transferred earlier than to Russian)! <br>  <b>But you will not believe</b> , clone ... classmates - no !!!  Well, to make a couple of adaptations, taking into account local concepts, and a couple of million registered users, in the first six months, I guarantee you! <br><br>  <b>Wonderful are your ways, Lord ...</b> <br>  But my friend, a <b>dentist</b> , with a friend, a dentist five years ago, started doing his own <b>livejournal</b> (http://jeeran.com) and did (while I puffed out my cheeks, and told him that he was a fool, and that the blog of hosts was full) So, six months ago, he sold his share to <a href="http://www.intel.com/capital/news/releases/090519.htm">Intel</a> for <a href="http://www.ameinfo.com/196868.html">** lemons !!!</a>  <a href="http://www.ameinfo.com/196868.html">dollars !!!</a>  , <a href="http://arabcrunch.com/2009/05/intel-capital-invest-2-two-jordanian-companies-jeeran-and-shoofeetv-video-interview-with-intels-vp.html">now read and now he puffs up his cheeks</a> when he sees me and asks, so sarcastically, so what?  - Fully blog hosts are talking about? <br><br>  Or other ‚Äúidiots‚Äù (I also laughed when I consulted them) wrote you won‚Äôt believe ... the <a href="http://shoofeetv.com/">program</a> !!!  Yes, you read the program for satellite TV correctly !!!  And they also received a ‚Äúsmall‚Äù contribution from Intel at a rate of <b>10 lemons, for garbage done, as I understand it on the druapale</b> !!! <br><br>  Of course, twenty million for a blog host are not billions of facebook, or a couple of lemons for the ‚Äúprogram‚Äù, but do you think we would have had enough with you ?!  :))) <br><br>  (looking at a clogged ashtray and two-year Fujitsu Siemens on which I write this panegyric) <br><br>  OK, are you racist?  Do you hate Arabs?  To hell!  Let's write a domain evaluation system, just not the same as estibot.com, but the type of social network ... (smile?) Well, well, smile, on <a href="http://www.dnforum.com/">this forum</a> registration costs 400 bucks a year from the snout, cheap package 70 - 80 bucks!  Come and count the snout!  And then - laugh together! <br>  Yes, and Estibot already pulls decently!  I think at least 200 kilobaksov, or even more. <br><br>  <b>I'm here on Habr√©, one comrade, (he is with my friends) told the cruel truth, if you want to do something, do it yourself, nobody will help you ... and he to hell is right!</b> <b><br><br></b>  <b>So, - The eye sees, yes the tooth is nymet :)))</b> <br><br>  <b>In many wisdom - a lot of sadness ?!</b> <br>  Or rather, the <b>one who laughs last is laughing!</b> <br>  This is me about myself! <br><br>  <b>PS</b> <br>  <i>And yet, over the years I have lived here, I noticed that a clear time lag, more precisely a temporary odds of several years, that is, what is now possible in Russia, will become fashionable in a couple of years!</i>  <i>So if you want ideas, I have their car and a small truck!</i>  <i>And do not need to invent a wheel - a bicycle!</i>  <i>You do not know what to do, ask (ask) I don‚Äôt feel sorry, I will help as much as I can!</i>  <i>I am not hiding ideas for anything!</i>  <i>Besides, I don‚Äôt think anyone will need this.</i>  <i>What lies on the surface is usually of no interest ...</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>It's a pity ...</i> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/67782/">https://habr.com/ru/post/67782/</a></p>
