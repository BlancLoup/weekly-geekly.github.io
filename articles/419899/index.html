  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Internet in the country: how to save?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It so happened that I had to spend almost the entire past year at the dacha.  It seems to be almost within the city, but still there is no communication except electricity.  No gas, no water, or, most importantly, the Internet!  But if gas can be bought in bottles, water can be taken from the well / well, then what about the Internet?  Constantly you will not sit on mobile traffic, especially if you work on freelancing, and do you want to watch movies in the evenings in good quality?  Last September, I began to look for a solution. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cv/mc/gr/cvmcgrl3q3xcpon_4qjgbegsmoe.jpeg" alt="image"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For some reason, only one operator in the Russian market offers mobile Internet that is truly unlimited in traffic for a relatively reasonable price.  All the others have the maximum traffic packets in the region of 30GB, which in modern realities is not enough for the ‚Äúhome‚Äù Internet.  I have a router in my car with such a package and I miss it every month.  So there is essentially no choice: only Yota. <br><br>  In the same holiday village a bunch of ads posted about the Internet connection from this provider.  Called, found out - prices start at 16 000r.  Itself one time kalym and put such antennas to friends and I know what equipment they use.  Indeed, at prices it will not be cheap even if you buy and install everything yourself.

      It was decided to follow the path of least resistance.  For a start, the WiFi-USB router of the aforementioned company was purchased: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/su/o7/-k/suo7-kl36u0suwptaxsdlrh2sqi.png"><br><br>  Although the city is close, it was possible to connect, but the speed ...  On EDGE more!  Generally unacceptable. <br><br>  In DNS, a home signal amplifier was purchased.  A USB modem is plugged into it and from it is already a cable to a computer or a power outlet (in the case of WiFi). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/em/_a/ww/em_awweqr4cy09pajbsjp-7husw.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Unfortunately, this device did not bring a significant improvement in the quality of the Internet.  Everything still slowed down and barely loaded.  Very often the connection disappeared completely. <br><br>  Then it became clear that this whole structure would have to be raised higher.  To protect against weather conditions, the entire antenna in conjunction with a modem was tightly wrapped with reinforced tape, and on top, also with the usual one.  The same tape attached to a conventional metal pipe found on the site.  I bought 10 meters of USB extension cable, now I don‚Äôt remember the cost, but something around 500r.  As a result, it turned out to raise the modem with an antenna to a height of about 8 meters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ns/sf/vm/nssfvmi93sihjslmvuckgkws9ve.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  That's when it all worked.  Appeared fairly stable Internet.  The speed made it easy to watch Youtube.  Here, for example, data on the connection for the last hour: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/st/gu/ht/stguht0bxzr3a8jumo2q-nkokkc.png" alt="image"><br><br>  To select the maximum SINR / RSRP ratio, it was necessary to simply rotate the pipe, choosing the optimal direction to the cell phone towers. <br><br>  Of course, many will say that the construction made ‚Äúon snot‚Äù will not work for a long time, moisture will form under the scotch due to evaporation and temperature drops, etc.  In response, we can say that this device has worked without any problems since September last year, and now it is through this that the post is sent to Habr.  She was not afraid of rain or snow or wind.  Everything always worked fairly stable.  SINR / RSRP is always within the limits of the screenshot, plus or minus a couple of units.  Sometimes the connection speed drops, but apparently it depends on the workload of the operator himself and for a long time it usually does not last. <br><br>  In the spring, from the wind and my crooked hands, the pipe fell (it was poorly fixed near the ridge of the house).  This made it possible to ‚Äúinventory‚Äù the device and see what state everything was in - no traces of moisture and rust deposits on the connectors and the device were found.  Everything continues to work to this day and nothing is planned to change. <br><br>  An extension cord from the device is plugged into a USB 5V outlet and the Internet is received via WiFi.  In the summer, when I want to work while sitting in the gazebo, I use a WiFi repeater purchased from a well-known store of Chinese goods.  And let the design look clumsy, but it works! <br><br>  Now the final calculations, how much was saved on the connection: <br><br><ul><li>  Modem: 2900r </li><li>  Antenna: 900r </li><li>  Cable: 500r </li></ul><br>  4300r against 16000r declared ‚Äúhookers‚Äù!  Almost four times.  I think it's a good savings.  Maybe someone will benefit from my experience, then this article is not written in vain! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/419899/">https://habr.com/ru/post/419899/</a></p>
