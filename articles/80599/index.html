  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Touchscreen or my home service history</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> I will begin my story by saying that for a long time my girlfriend was trying to persuade me to go to the rink, I stubbornly and long refused.  By the new year I bought skates, I got.  On January 9, we went to Krylatskoye, arrived, were late for the session due to the sharpening of skates and decided to go for a later one.  It was still 3 hours before the next session, and we decided to go sit somewhere, it turned out there was a bowling alley, we decided to go sit there.  Up to this point in the cold under -20, we were already about an hour (until we reached, while the tickets, while sharpening), my legs were already beginning to freeze specifically.  TELEPHONE (htc max 4g) for this time from a pocket jeans got it only a couple of times, to see the time.  The phone is the main character of this article, so with a capital letter and from this point on the story about him. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Two hours later, after I‚Äôm out of bowling, my phone rings, I‚Äôm naively trying to unlock the phone (those who deal with iPhone-like shells will understand me, I must translate the slider on the screen with my finger) and I understand that I can‚Äôt do it.  Glitch or not, the phone is sent to reboot, download, friendly screensaver Yota, Windows and EVERYTHING !!!  The screen works, the touch buttons and on the case work, but the screen for my attempts to play woodpecker is not perceived.  There was no visible damage or other artifacts on the screen.  We decided that the phone froze and put it in a bag before it got into the heat of the ice palace.  Once inside, my dear, with her keen eye, looked at this picture at an angle on the screen. <br><img src="http://img8.imageshost.ru/imgs/100113/80c57cf645/eb7fc.jpg"><br>  The picture is not mine, but the screen looked exactly like this, almost a rectangle with divorces in the center.  Having never dealt with htc products I didn‚Äôt know what it was and why.  The warranty for the device ended in December and it was inside that the Chinese learned how to make devices with a limited service life, so that in a year they would buy new ones :) <br>  January 10 was devoted to Google, a lot of similar problems were found, warranty devices in Moscow were accepted by services without any questions, because the problem turned out to be even wider than I had supposed. <br>  The reasons for the services were different: <br>  - some magnetic fields from the framework of metal detectors (I have passed a very large number of them in a year, including international airports) - will disappear <br>  -physical impact, the effect of a crushed screen (as one of the girls said, called her figure of 31 kg. per square cm, she had to jump on it) <br>  -drops into the body of the phone fluid (you need to fill the phone completely) <br>  And there are many more and many different reasons, but nowhere was it said about the temperature drop, but since none of the reasons described on the forum were suitable for me, only she remained.  At home, I decided to pick up the screen and realized that the screen was a layer cake, after which I read that it was not a screen, but a touchscreen.  It turns out that many htc models use a screen with a touchscreen superimposed on it.  Having slightly lifted the edge of the film, I noticed that the stain became smaller, it became like this (only the author's photos will be later) <br><img src="http://img8.imageshost.ru/imgs/100113/ec10a08f13/5f7d8.jpg"><br>  The quality is not very, tried to turn out so that the artifact was visible.  Even takshkrin earned, but going out and returning I found the original picture.  It was clear that the bug was not localized and a repair with replacement was required.  Began the search for repair services.  Prices ranged from 5000r to 12000r in Moscow, once pricked the screen on the e-ten m600 and knew that the replacement is really expensive, but replace what forgive?!  I began to read, call, ask and found out that in the services they hang noodles on their ears and change the screen with the touchscreen completely, as they say they are one and cannot be done on the other.  Finding on the Internet just selling touchscreens, it was found that this is a separate piece of glass with several layers of film.  The question arose: So why it is impossible to replace only him?  The answer was found on the first forum from one of the service staff - you damage the screen.  Scary and scary for the carcass, but there is nothing useful to search for the sale of takskriny, found separately and screens by the way.  I thought, scratched my turnip, strangled the toad, who whined that better repair in the service, you would not break the rest, even more expensive, but you would not pay twice.  Yesterday the touchscreen was acquired without any problems (the bargainers became furious with the prices, but found a place with the lowest price), several more were ordered from ebay (I decided now there are no films, why? You can change the touchscreen).  New looks like this <br><img src="http://img8.imageshost.ru/imgs/100113/b13fb218fd/ff160.jpg"><br>  Items purchased, the background is told, now the action :) <br>  The <a href="http://www.pdacenter.ru/razborka/htc_max_4g/">disassembly instructions were</a> quickly found in Russian.  A document was found from the most htc <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/13974858/QUARTZ-Service-Manual-htc-max4g">for services</a> , by the way there are still many instructions for other models.  (who will help to tear out the pdf from there I will be very grateful by the way) <br>  It was prepared: <br>  Manicure scissors <br>  Two tweezers <br>  Scalpel <br>  Set of screwdrivers <br>  Cleaning Cloth <br>  Lcd cleaning liquid <br>  Hairdryer (1400W) <br>  and so on trifles, the trash on the table was also moved apart :) <br>  Let's get started <br>  Unscrew the screws, work on the latches and removal of the mat.  The boards went without problems.  Small things that are removed in the service manual, you can not touch, except for vibro-motor.  He has a very small connector and pulls out the infection is very difficult. <br>  In the photo it is on top, the only element with such a connector, you will not confuse <br><img src="http://img8.imageshost.ru/imgs/100113/7160c2c1f5/be8e9.jpg"><br>  In the hands after removing the board, there remains such a carcass with plumes <br><img src="http://img8.imageshost.ru/imgs/100113/8491567a27/3f168.jpg"><br>  The cable to the motherboard is fastened with one connector, it will be possible to disconnect it without problems, on the mat.  The board is a small comb of contacts at the top, directly opposite the slot for the sd card <br><img src="http://img8.imageshost.ru/imgs/100113/516969cdfd/fd3d9.jpg"><br>  Then I went to the point of separating the screen from the upper half of the case, htc suggests using an oven, I used a hairdryer and brought the glass to a slightly warm-to-touch state.  Immediately under the trains there is a small platform, you will need to push it <br><img src="http://img8.imageshost.ru/imgs/100113/34c2136c50/f515f.jpg"><br>  Do not be afraid, gently pressing start to separate the screen, there is a lot of glue there, so it may not immediately succumb. <br>  The platform on which you press is part of the body, so do not squeeze it hard.  Through it, for some reason, the cable from the screen is missed, the cable from the touchscreen goes around it. <br><img src="http://img8.imageshost.ru/imgs/100113/a9e06c9beb/3ef25.jpg"><br>  Left loop from the touchscreen, right from the screen.  Both were then shifted, bypassing the passage through the holes in the case.  There is a lot of space, there are no sharp bends, don't worry about safety. <br>  Then came the turn of the screen separation.  Here it is by the way :) <br><img src="http://img8.imageshost.ru/imgs/100113/69ee8998b7/d1f5a.jpg"><br>  Frightened by the messages of the services that they say it is impossible to separate, will lead to the damage of the matrix, etc., etc., I approached the case finely, a scalpel :) <br>  Warming up the touchscreen glass, I began to gradually separate the glass from the screen around the perimeter.  Because of the body of the matrix, by the way, you can slightly lift it up so as not to interfere, there was almost nothing to be seen, and at first I thought that the screen was really flooded with something like black tow, which is usually filled with chokes or other batteries in the PSU, but as I was surprised when I found around the perimeter of the touchscreen glass only double-sided adhesive tape <br><img src="http://img8.imageshost.ru/imgs/100113/83ebbe8cd9/f05cb.jpg"><br>  No more matrix to the touchscreen is not attached.  Separate them without problems, do not be afraid to damage something, they are not so much glued together. <br>  The screen was simply hoisted onto a new touchscreen, without ribbons or any other kind of fixings, and hoisted into its own box bed.  They are tight enough to each other.  After that, the perimeter of the touchscreen glass was heated and firmly pressed to the body (I hope the glue grabbed).  Attempts to separate the structure from the body have so far failed, I hope in the future it will not fall out.  After that, the build process took place. <br><img src="http://img8.imageshost.ru/imgs/100113/bdcaa09ac1/718a6.jpg"><br>  A device with a new touchscreen on the left, an old one with an artifact on the right. <br>  With this I want to finish my story about the hour and a half repair of the phone, which was successful at home with improvised means.  All sorts of little things like cleaning the case from the accumulated dust, testing the new touchscreen in the floor of the disassembled phone and maybe something else I dropped, since this is not particularly important.  I would like this article to help people who are in the same situation with htc phones or other companies, and angry services are shaking their heads and saying that they need a lot of money and a replacement for almost the entire phone.  Be vigilant, if a broken part of your phone is sold on ebay and it is independent (screen, case, touchscreen, motor, motherboard, etc.), then be sure that the repair will cost you less than the official service says and you can do it both by yourself and by literate people, but in some basement and for less money. <br>  I understand that I want to eat everything and always, but why change something that does not require replacement, and perhaps you will not change it, but simply write what has changed. <br>  Thanks to htc for the service guide, compax.ru for the presence of the touchscreen (make the prices smaller, 300% of the cheat is strong) <br>  Thanks to the unknown Chinese seller and the mail, which sent and delivered me small spare parts to my max week in three for money many times smaller than it costs in Moscow :) <br>  PS I bought the matrix with a 300% wrap, as I needed the work phone urgently and it would take a long time to wait for spare parts from Taiwan :) <br>  Thanks to all who master this story.  I can answer questions, advise something, share my experience. <br>  UP: Some of the photos were edited and reduced according to the advice of the person who contacted me (thanks to him for that) </div>
