  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Facing user</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  via <a href="http://ad28.ru/">AD28</a> <br><br>  I want to appeal to users!  You do not have the impression that sometimes, the Internet is not a tool for you, and you become a tool of the Internet?  Are you just ‚Äúclicks with avatars‚Äù?  The problem is that the ‚Äúclicks with avatars‚Äù became a bargaining chip of the Internet and the main source of economic attractiveness of this industry.  The creators of popular sites forget that real people are behind accounts, and they are the sources of these clicks.  And these people have some kind of opinion on the site‚Äôs convenience and its utility, which sometimes conflicts with the opinion of the site‚Äôs creators.  With this small note I want to show how this contradiction is being resolved now and how it should be resolved in the future. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The startup movement is gaining momentum in Russia.  There are more and more translation materials on the topic of searching for ideas, developing, promoting the project.  Unfortunately, there are very few articles advocating the need for quality work with the startup audience.  How should ‚Äúpreventive measures‚Äù be built to improve the understanding between users and the administration of the resource?  I believe that inattention to cause and effect relationships can lead to an error in the choice of tools to solve the problem.  Perhaps you should first talk about the essence, and then move on to the technology? <br><br>  I think that today, users of many popular resources can be divided into three groups: <br>  1. Capricious children; <br>  2. Underdeveloped adults; <br>  3

      Describe each group does not make sense.  The names speak for themselves. <br><br>  Here, the main thing to think about is that the first group is likely to actively influence the opinion about your service among external audiences.  The second group is not so active as to interact intensively with external audiences, but they do influence the opinion of managers about the users of their site.  The third group is the very ‚Äúclicks with avatars‚Äù for which the Internet exists.  It seems that they have no complaints, no requirements, they just click - open accounts, get pages, upload pictures of their cats, get blogs that don't write anything.  These are ideal users - they do not know how to write to the support service and they do not affect anything. <br><br>  If you have any misunderstandings with users, then you have three ways to solve these problems: <br><br>  1. Convince your users (which is possible only if you have communication with users) <br>  2. Change your strategy and adjust it to the wishes and needs of users. <br>  3. <a href="http://spiridonov.ru/post/205">Do not give your users free-thinking (they demanded one, they will demand another)</a> <br><br>  I do not know about you, dear reader, but the 3rd, most common option in runet, seems to me not very marketing. <br>  Often, by offering the market a clear idea that is claimed by the widest segments of the Internet population, the creators of a startup forget about technical problems, usability issues, and the design is done in haste. <br><br>  Many recommendations for creating successful Internet businesses are full of tips, like ‚Äúidentify a problem and find a simple solution‚Äù, ‚Äúunderstand who your users are,‚Äù etc.  All these tips are absolutely fair, but is it possible to develop the project only by the creator's intuition?  You have come up with a problem, come up with a solution.  We decided for the user that he would be comfortable and what was not.  What will attract and what will turn away.  And all this without a user!  Do you know when you want to get acquainted with your user, chat with him, find out what he thinks about your service?  When will the outflow of the audience!  Then you will begin to think, ‚Äúwhat is wrong?  What else do these ‚Äúclicks with avatars‚Äù need?  I already made the perfect service / portal / social network! ‚Äù.  Not.  Perfect service will make the one who is open.  Who watched you and took into account all your mistakes.  Who carefully listened to the opinions of users of your site. <br><br>  I will not consider in detail the procedural aspects of communication with users of a massive Internet project.  I just want to emphasize that each member of the team, especially if the team is large enough, can participate in shaping the reputation of the service.  It is important to be friendly and user-oriented.  Not in words, but in deeds. <br><br>  Ps.  In RuNet, it is difficult to find any materials on this topic.  Among many vague articles, I want to highlight the <a href="http://www.amazedev.com/uspeshnyj-proekt-orientirovannyj-na-polzovatelya/">article by Pavel Konoplitsky "A successful project is a user-oriented project</a> . <a href="http://www.amazedev.com/uspeshnyj-proekt-orientirovannyj-na-polzovatelya/">"</a>  I do not agree with some of the nuances, however, without any doubt, the material is worthy of careful reading and deliberation. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/37504/">https://habr.com/ru/post/37504/</a></p>
