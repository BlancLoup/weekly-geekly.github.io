  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Where to find a good instructor or driving school</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  As soon as a person decides to <s>get the rights to</s> learn how to drive a car, he faces a dilemma: go to a driving school or trust an instructor?  In addition, you need to get answers to many questions: which car to choose for practical classes?  What is the guide when choosing an instructor or school?  How to make it cheaper?  Which side to approach the cow exam in the traffic police?  All these questions arose before me in full growth, when I decided to get right by spring.  The main thing in choosing an instructor or driving school is trust.  If this question is also relevant for you or your loved ones now - I advise the site <a href="http://www.gazu.ru/">Gazu.ru.</a> <br><br> <a href="http://www.gazu.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1e6/331/0c6/1e63310c6595f18297e485480d35c614.png"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  If to describe the project from the point of view of the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/twins/blog/150406/">rule of one sentence</a> , Gazu.ru is a site for those who learn to drive, which allows you to choose an instructor or driving school with your own current base. <br><br>  Gazu.ru is not the only site in runet that offers databases of driving schools and instructors, its <acronym>UTP</acronym> is in the relevance of data and individual selection.  So, for example, information about all Moscow driving schools was updated in September 2012 - by the way, in Moscow there were exactly 100 of them now. The site contains information on four cities - except for Moscow, this is St. Petersburg, Ufa and Novosibirsk.

      There are only 38 instructors on the site, but everyone has been selected.  The majority of instructors have been cooperating with the portal for more than five years, and resource managers know all the teachers personally.  Often, users simply call the Moscow number (495) 988-57-35 - and at the end of the line a person who knows all the instructors personally and can give some more information than in the instructor‚Äôs profile - the character of the instructor, the car in which area he teaches how much work, etc. <br><br>  The portal administration constantly monitors the availability of licenses for instructors, the quality of the services provided and is attentive to student feedback (instructors who work poorly lose the right to place their card on the site). <br><br>  Despite the fact that the placement of instructors is paid, in order to become an instructor to Gazu.ru, it is not enough just to install additional pedals in your car, register on the site and refill the account.  Site managers hold personal meetings, checks (by phone and as a student).  As a result, on gazu.ru only every third person is accepted.  This once again ensures that students do not have to deal with non-professionals, amateurs without education, and old kolymagami, the resources of which are only enough to dock to the auto-roll. <br><br>  All this allows you to avoid situations where, for example, the price is 300, but in fact it turns out 500 or a whole ‚Äúteam‚Äù hides behind one virtual website - you call them, and they say ‚Äúthe instructor fell ill, come to us‚Äù Thanks to our work, the chances of encountering this on our site are minimal. <br><br>  Other sources of the project‚Äôs earnings are banner advertising and priority placement of driving schools at issue. <br><br><h4>  A little about the site itself </h4><br>  The site has been operating since 2005, and just recently experienced a redesign, which was the reason for this publication. <br><br>  For example, the registration form has been simplified: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/66e/141/5a4/66e1415a4fa6240035f34cf1138a8a5d.png"><br>  <sup><i>Registration window</i></sup> <br><br>  In addition, usability was worked out: the designers tried to ensure that the distance to any desired page did not exceed three clicks from the main page. <br><br>  In the ‚Äú <strong><a href="http://www.gazu.ru/instructor/">Instructors</a></strong> ‚Äù section there is a list of instructors whose cards can be sorted by rating, reviews or price.  Directly in the teacher's card you can find all the information you need: contact details, instructor's photo, description of services provided and rates, information on experience, time and areas for practical training, the type of car used for training, the advantages of this instructor over his colleagues and even such details like bad habits of the instructor and the smell in the car. <br><br>  Any user who does not like the training method can simply complain to the instructor with a click. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/803/284/257/80328425715626b3172ca059789b5f43.png"><br>  <sup><i>Instructor card</i></sup> <br><br>  Also in the instructor's card there are subsections ‚Äú <strong>Video</strong> ‚Äù and ‚Äú <strong>Testimonials</strong> ‚Äù, which allow to get more detailed information about the quality of the services provided by the driving instructor, and, so to speak, ‚Äúto personally meet‚Äù the instructor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4dc/05e/6ed/4dc05e6ed2cb8fbec5f582de3ea5fd77.png"><br><br>  If for some reason the user is not satisfied with the selected instructor, the site will independently compile a collection of similar offers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7ee/8c1/f84/7ee8c1f84cf4a6388f7b6b42668a5841.png"><br><br>  Approximately on the same principle the section ‚Äú <strong><a href="http://www.gazu.ru/avtoshkola/">Driving Schools</a></strong> ‚Äù works, the choice of proposals in which you can do, based on a suitable district of Moscow. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b34/ad1/a0c/b34ad1a0ce63c0927ee7139bbdee10f1.png"><br>  <sup><i>Instructor search filter</i></sup> <br><br>  <strong>The filter for the search for</strong> an instructor / driving school is so detailed that it makes it possible to find a suitable teacher or school by place of occupation (metro stations and city districts), by gender, by car brand, type of drive and transmission, by power and ‚Äústuffing‚Äù of a car, by cost per hour or course of study, as well as on additional parameters such as training without a license, emergency driving training and extreme driving, classes on weekends, lessons at autodrome, etc. <br><br>  In addition, the site has ‚Äú <strong><a href="http://blog.gazu.ru/">Blogs</a></strong> ‚Äù of resource users (where to go without them), ‚Äú <strong>Articles</strong> ‚Äù (own reviews, ratings, tips, recommendations, expert assessments, articles in the ‚Äúautohack‚Äù style), and also ‚Äú <strong><a href="http://otvety.gazu.ru/">Questions and Answers</a></strong> ‚Äù, which , despite the fact that he appeared on the site recently, began to enjoy great popularity.  Here the user can get answers to his questions and expert advice. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/297/e4a/824/297e4a8247501feac7ef3d287915ca40.png"><br>  <sup><i>Section "Question-Answer"</i></sup> <br><br>  Separately, it is worth mentioning <a href="http://www.gazu.ru/articles/">articles</a> that are based on personal experience of instructors and car enthusiasts - for example, <a href="http://www.gazu.ru/car/winter_exploation/10246/">an article about the choice of winter tires</a> , and at the same time a review of the ‚Äú <a href="http://www.gazu.ru/car/winter_exploation/10248/">best winter tires 2012</a> ‚Äù.  Fans of gadgets will probably be interested in <a href="http://www.gazu.ru/car/gadgets/10236/">material about DVRs</a> , and a <a href="http://www.gazu.ru/car/gadgets/10255/">review of the best models of 2012</a> . <br><br>  Those who are planning in the near future to become a car enthusiast and who will <a href="http://www.gazu.ru/examen_gibdd/">take the exam in the traffic police</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/10c/dc1/61b/10cdc161baf71366d601a2236b61a0a6.png"><br><br>  Even from the interesting, such as " <a href="http://www.gazu.ru/driving/for_beginners/10247/">Signals and gestures of the traffic controller,</a> " although in Moscow, it's almost like meeting a dinosaur, I guess. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/648/bd5/e40/648bd5e40997dd17bad1c1b663f48134.png"><br><br>  The average attendance of Gazu.ru at the moment is about 10 thousand users per day.  At the same time, on request "auto-instructors" the site is in second position on Google and on the fourth line in Yandex. <br><br>  Hope the review has been helpful to you.  If you have questions on this topic - ask, I will answer as far as possible. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/159461/">https://habr.com/ru/post/159461/</a></p>
