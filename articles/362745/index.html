  <section class="page js-page"><h1>IT company office as part of corporate life</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> We decided to share a part of our corporate culture, revealing some moments from the life of our office, to tell and show how everything is arranged here.  It is no secret that IT companies strive to create interesting office spaces for their employees, so that you can feel comfortable, relaxed, find quiet places for solving important tasks, or a creative space for inspiration and great ideas.  In general, the office should be a place where you like to be, create and translate your plans into reality, as well as where you can feel at ease, well, almost at home.  From the atmosphere in the office depends on the mood of each day, especially when we spend a lot of time here. <br><br>  Once in the office of any company once, you can already say what the daily life here is - formal or more free, what the situation is - strict or unconstrained. <br><br>  Today's offices of large IT companies are in themselves a manifestation of creativity and solve an important task - to create conditions for a productive workflow, which is imperatively important to have fun.

      UC Browser is headquartered in Guangzhou, China.  Our office is located on 12 floors of a huge business building near the city center in a new rapidly growing area of ‚Äã‚ÄãGuangzhou.  There are about 3000 of us here, some of whom work in international markets. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/05f/c08/838/05fc08838e4a4e3f84bd03d16b906763.JPG" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The team working on the development of the company in other countries works within the framework of one department - International Business Development.  Among us there are colleagues from China, we are from Russia, colleagues from Brazil, Spain and Latin America, Arab countries, Indonesia.  Until recently, the guys from Vietnam and India worked with us here, now they are in the opened offices of UC Browser in their countries. <br><br>  Like any modern IT company, we have a lot of cool moments that we really like. <br><br>  The entire office is divided into a work area in the form of a normal open space, meeting rooms and recreation areas. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c72/efd/dfd/c72efddfd00245159012217e55d23361.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  Openspace is pleasant to us, because it is very green, in the workplace of everyone there are fresh flowers in pots.  When they bloom, it becomes especially beautiful. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/688/40c/f24/68840cf2437a4ce389a707e2c9f27707.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  All our meeting and negotiation rooms are named after cities from different countries.  Our capital too. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a4d/0d1/934/a4d0d1934ce94096aee7587a47d86335.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  The office has many informal work spaces.  Where, on the one hand, you can think in silence or arrange braimming, on the other hand, just drink tea and relax or chat with colleagues. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2cf/d04/2ed/2cfd042edac84bfc96a216b028acc7e3.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  Or show imagination. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cfa/d48/3fe/cfad483fee0f4de8ab3cc1c0184c85bb.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  Working all day, we do not need to think about what to eat today - in the office there are two large canteens where you can have breakfast, lunch and dinner.  To be honest, it makes life a lot easier, as it significantly saves time on daily cooking.  We also always have an afternoon snack - at 4 o'clock in the afternoon a beautiful woman always brings fresh snacks to our recreation area.  Well, tea or coffee is always available.  This tea has one feature - it is very useful.  The Chinese rarely drink tea in bags, in the office only natural ingredients that can be used to your own taste when brewing tea. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/354/f42/84b/354f4284beff4739b13d732ee66460b1.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  To switch c work tasks and relax, we have a zone of games and sports.  There is a pool here - it is among Chinese colleagues that it is very popular.  We often play table tennis or table football. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4b9/90b/247/4b990b24723d4a6cba23cc905b7c5b2c.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  For especially angry or tired - there is a punching bag. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e38/16f/a44/e3816fa441bd42e896da120b356339d3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  When you just want to cheer up a little - we go to the treadmills.  Run, shower - and again felt a surge of energy. <br><br>  Perhaps the arrangement of the office in this style is a recent trend.  Employers care more and more about the healthy lifestyle of their employees, this makes business more socially responsible, and for us this is an excellent opportunity to combine workflow with a good thing for health. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b2c/887/a60/b2c887a60f674576bf2b1bb682db06bc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Special attention should be paid to the chips that just cheer up. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a47/25d/232/a4725d2321dd4aec97ff195c1802c72d.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  In the office you can often see our toy squirrels - they are everywhere.  This is our symbol and talisman, so besides the little squirrels you can also see someone in a squirrel costume who just wants to hug you or shake your hand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c57/d2e/f2e/c57d2ef2e3054a6387481322888b8546.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  The office does not have a dress code or any special style of clothing, here we have complete freedom.  Of course, no one walks in slippers, but otherwise everything is very free.  90% of employees are guys under 28 years old, everyone looks decent, but you rarely meet someone in a strict suit.  Well, with a sense of humor, our colleagues are also doing well. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b65/e64/895/b65e6489596e4036af9433a91c0f8099.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  Another part of our corporate culture is a dream.  If someone is tired, after dinner you can go to sleep in a secluded place in silence and the lights off.  This is often practiced in our company, and it is part of Chinese culture. <br><br>  For all national holidays we receive gifts.  Often this is something associated with corporate symbols, such as mugs, t-shirts or sweets.  At the recent celebration of Halloween in the office there was a big party, anyone could order a suit in advance to their own taste and color, and then get a special make up. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2c9/507/966/2c9507966b6d4c3b8b5be6d0ba097e91.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  Each department always has photos of employees in fun frames - most often they are memories from joint trips for the weekend or general corporate events.  Such events are organized for us by the company, for example, we all went to a safari to animals together or went to a different city for a few days to the beach. <br><br>  Or in the office you can often see guys with badminton rackets or skates.  These two sports are very popular here.  The company rents playgrounds for these sports, and every week everyone can attend training free of charge. <br><br>  This is how we keep all our achievements.  On each floor you can find something of your own, depending on the function of the department. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c67/b7b/c6d/c67b7bc6da4745ad906705fe73d81e78.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  The company takes care of us not only during working hours, but also outside the office life.  For foreigners working in a company in China, free housing is provided, including all amenities in the form of paying bills for the Internet or electricity, which is very expensive here, cleaning service, household items in the form of heaters in the cold season or laundry detergent, and all sorts of little things for houses.  For children coming to Guangzhou from other cities of China, the company provides housing for several weeks, so that during this time each employee in a quiet mode could find an apartment and not be stressed about this. <br><br>  We work great in our office.  It is pleasant to combine work with leisure, to communicate with colleagues who have already become friends, to invent new ideas for implementation. <br><br>  Our little squirrel says hello to you all. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7c8/0ab/450/7c80ab45017444779080f9a15669a217.JPG" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/362745/">https://habr.com/ru/post/362745/</a></p>
