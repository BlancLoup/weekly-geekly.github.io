  <section class="page js-page"><h1>I saw the future. Chapter 1</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  That night it was difficult for him to sleep.  He lay on the bed and watched the light of street lamps mist spreading through the curtains.  In the morning, there should be a presentation of his project, on which Daniel Wilsby worked for almost five years.  Thousands of thoughts circled in my head, he repeated the presentation text to himself over and over again, represented the admissions office, played scenario after script, the result of which would be determined only in the morning. <br>  To be a professional, which he was too responsible.  He could not allow even the slightest mistake, it would be tantamount to career suicide, his fate would be decided in the morning, and he was well aware of that. <br>  Stay in this time, delay it, think a little more, do not let yourself fall asleep in order to plan everything properly.  Anxiety and pacification fought each other, unable to win. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Daniel opened his eyes and turned off the alarm a minute before the ‚Äúrise‚Äù signal.  He reached out, rubbed his eyes, and yawned, wandered into the shower, which finally had to wake him up.  A light breakfast was prepared on the stove at the appointed time, and the kettle warmed up the water for morning coffee.  Pleasant music played throughout the house, setting the rhythm for the whole day.  Throughout his life, Daniel dedicated to creating smart things, his pedantry knew no bounds, and it was thanks to her and his stubbornness that he became who he was - the designer of the intelligence of automated life-arrangement systems.  The last stable model of such a system controlled its entire life, ranging from wastewater treatment for reuse and to refreshing the air in the toilet.  She still went through the stage of adaptation to her master and did not always do everything as it should.  This time, she mistakenly washed his favorite checkered sweater, which showed traces of bleach, which can hardly be removed for a hundred washes. <br>  The incoming call signal ran through the house; it was Edward, his assistant, calling. <br>  - Hi Dan!  Good that you already woke up.  Mr. Sidzoku called me again, he is very nervous, again he asks me to make a pre-order for him.  I can‚Äôt do anything with him, he is very wound up, he doesn‚Äôt give me a pass. <br>  - Ed, you perfectly know my opinion on this matter.  No pre-orders will be and the point!  Think of something and get rid of it.  Not so much time, we hid the details, soon everyone will know everything. <br>  - It's easy for you to talk, but he already got me.  Worn after me everywhere, yesterday even appeared at the diner next to my house, Merien almost burst into tears at dinner. <br>  - Be patient a little more, everything will be decided soon, there is no way back, either all - or ... well, there you yourself know. <br>  ‚ÄúOkay, chef, the chef will be done ...‚Äù <br>  - Stop calling me that, do not be a child, before communication. <br>  - Bye Bye. <br>  Edward Solvato was his longtime friend and best friend, they were friends since high school and always supported each other.  Together they graduated from college and worked together.  Real male friendship, they did everything together and always achieved excellent results. <br><br>  It's time to move to the laboratory, a lot of things need to be prepared and checked, there should be no mistakes.  Daniel went to the closet and dressed in suit number nine, which smelled pleasantly and came from the heat of a recent ironing.  Taking a briefcase with technical documentation, he immediately changed the security cipher, everything should be perfect.  Outside the window, from the technical floor, the car was already going down - it was necessary to make it in time for traffic jams.  Well, everything is ready, he thought to himself, it's time to go. <br><br>  His hands fell on the steering wheel, which instantly ran the lights, stopping under the pads of his fingers.  After a moment, the motor slightly rustled, and the chair, slightly stooping, entangled it with protective nets.  Outside, the sun was shining brightly and the windshield of the car switched to polarization mode, setting the desired level of tinting.  At the exit from the residential complex, the car's number in the form of a bar code was quickly recognized by the scanner and the gate immediately went underground.  It was still early and traffic jams on the road has not yet been observed. <br>  Having driven out onto the highway, Daniel turned on the car navigation system, then the car moved by itself, in accordance with the traffic rules broadcast on this part of the road.  Data on traffic jams has not yet been, and the speed limit was not limited. <br>  ‚ÄúShow me the news,‚Äù he said to the onboard system, and on the windshield flashed an image of the announcer from the local television network.  He happily spoke about the morning news, about new measures of birth control and food production, something about the morality and spiritual greatness of the nation.  The news rating was in the green sector, which means nothing particularly important happened.  Daniel asked to turn off the news and turn on the audio channel, he did not want to think about anything now. </div>
