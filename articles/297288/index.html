      Mindfields is a site for enterprises and talented, creative professionals - designers, engineers, physicists, chemists, designers - with worthy designs and projects.  With his help, such talents will be able to find a suitable enterprise for the joint implementation of their project. <br><br>  A couple of years ago, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis service arose, and we decided to implement it.  In his spare time, started to develop the site.  We got <a href="https://mindfields.ru/">mindfields.ru</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b96/bae/c1b/b96baec1bd884a37a617d23eece872f5.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Now we take further steps - difficult and interesting: we present Mindfields to users! <br>  Potential users of the service are enterprises interested in new developments and ideas, and creators of such developments. <br><br>  <b>Mindfields will allow them to find each other:</b> <br><ul><li>  Developers will be able to choose a suitable enterprise for their project, which has a production base, professional competence, financial resources; </li><li>  enterprises, having declared on the site their interest in new projects, gain the opportunity to find interesting developments and ideas for their business. </li></ul><br><h4>  Mindfields creates legal security for users. </h4><br>  The relationship between the author of the development and the enterprise is quite delicate and the trusting partnership requires time and effective protection tools. <br>  Our service allows you to easily issue the necessary contracts that protect both the developer and the company: <br><ul><li>  at the project discussion stage: confidentiality agreement and guarantee of copyright; </li><li>  for the implementation of the project: an agreement on joint activities, a license agreement, an agreement on the "sale" of the project and others. </li></ul><br>  The administration of Mindfields, at the request of users, concludes an agreement on confidentiality and guarantees of copyright.  Thus, we guarantee the confidentiality of user information about their projects.  But even without such an agreement, our obligation not to disclose information about projects and not to use them is enshrined in the Mindfields Terms of Use, which are an agreement with users. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/464/3d9/98a/4643d998a6cd4a86a44f899efa55ff54.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  How Mindfields works. </h4><br>  Developers registered on the site have the opportunity to send a specific enterprise, also registered on the site, a description of their project, with the necessary materials attached.  Already at this stage, the developer may condition access to the project by concluding a confidentiality agreement and guarantee of the right of authorship.  In this case, the enterprise will receive a notification of the incoming project and the text of the agreement, signing which, will be able to familiarize itself with the developer‚Äôs proposal.  The project is not related to the agreement will be available to the company at the time of receipt. <br><br>  If our dream and the desire of the developer come true - the project is interested in the enterprise, then the parties can draw on Mindfields a suitable contract for the project.  Mindfields offers a wide choice: it can be a joint venture agreement, a project ‚Äúsale‚Äù agreement, a licensing agreement and others. <br>  The texts of the Mindfields contracts are quite detailed and take into account various aspects of the relationship between the developer and the enterprise.  They are not designed as ‚Äújunk templates for a couple of pages‚Äù, but as informative documents, ready for very significant projects. <br>  Texts are accompanied by detailed comments for users as necessary to draw up a contract, which may be the consequences of certain conditions. <br><br>  For the convenience of users, we have provided for the possibility of drawing up contracts not only on paper with handwritten signatures, but also signing them with an analogue of a handwritten signature, by performing certain actions on the site (the law allows us to enter into contracts in this way).  This can be convenient, for example, for projects of low cost when partners are located at a far distance. <br><br>  Information about contracts on Mindfields is presented on the website: <a href="https://mindfields.ru/contracts">mindfields.ru/contracts</a> , <a href="https://mindfields.ru/manuals/contracts">mindfields.ru/manuals/contracts</a> . <br><br>  Developers can submit to Mindfields their developments to a particular enterprise, or as an open project. <br><br>  In the first case, the developer chooses the enterprise and forms a description of his project with the application of various photos, videos and other materials.  The project can be issued a confidentiality agreement and guarantees of copyright, as well as various options for cooperation agreements.  Their text will be sent to the company along with the project.  If the developer issues a confidentiality agreement, the enterprise will be able to access the project only after it is signed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/13e/979/6a4/13e9796a443b44e598ec38257533c91a.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6e3/af3/255/6e3af3255ae3486b800a29bed322da61.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Projects and publications posted by users in the public domain are available to any Mindfields visitor in the Projects and Publications section of <a href="https://mindfields.ru/publics">mindfields.com/publics</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a5a/ae5/85a/a5aae585aa284274a05d573b930850aa.png" alt="image"><br><br>  By itself, all users have access to the internal messenger and contact details page.  Each user can develop his profile by publishing detailed information confirming his qualifications, experience and capabilities. <br><br><h4>  Mindfields is evolving. </h4><br>  We invite specialists and enthusiasts in various fields to Mindfields. <br>  We invite companies to cooperate who are interested in new ideas and developments. <br><br><h4>  Try it, you will enjoy Mindfields! </h4><br>  Thank you for your attention. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297288/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297288/</a></p>
