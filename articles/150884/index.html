  <section class="page js-page"><h1>GoDaddy's radical decision to fight conservatives</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For many years I have been using GoDaddy hosting for a part of my minor projects.  These projects do not require close attention to themselves, and therefore I do not particularly carefully monitor their performance - they live their quiet lives.  Nevertheless, these sites are important to me, so the next trick of the hoster seriously upset me. <br><br>  It should be noted that the sites hosted on GoDaddy were developed a long time ago - 5-6 years ago and were written in <b>PHP4</b> . <br><br>  The hoster did not seem to me bad, although he did not let me relax completely, but kept in tune the systematic (once a quarter) problems with the visibility of my projects.  In such cases, I wrote to the caliper and the next day I received a clever answer like ‚ÄúWell, he knows, we glanced - everything works for us.  Look for shoals in yourself. ".  And it really worked.  Once I decided for the sake of the experiment to wait until the appeal in support of the week.  As a result, the websites were silent all this week, and a few hours after my letter to GoDaddy they started working again.  The response to the claim was a copy-paste of the previous ones.  "Well, FIG know ...".  No apologies.

      But this time, GoDaddy outdid himself. <a name="habracut"></a>  Yesterday I discovered that some of my sites are behaving strangely - for some of the main page it was impossible to go to sections and subsections (an indication of the goal for the transition is transmitted through a parameter in the link), while others also have an error like <i>‚ÄúCall-time pass-by -reference has been deprecated "</i> began to appear.  Guessing the reasons was not difficult - on the hosting something was wrong with the PHP version.  I checked suspicions by replacing some part of <i>$ HTTP_GET_VARS</i> and <i>$ HTTP_POST_VARS</i> with <i>$ _GET</i> and <i>$ _POST,</i> respectively.  It worked.  I looked at the PHP settings in the hosting control panel and found that nothing had changed there.  One of three options is offered: <b>PHP4</b> , <b>PHP5.2</b> and <b>PHP5.3</b> .  The first item is selected.  I wrote to the caliper - the brave guys from the support cheerfully answered that GoDaddy had already abandoned <b>PHP4</b> since August 1, and all conservatives like me were deftly transferred to the <b>PHP5.3</b> version.  Fine!  The right move!  It is strange only that they did not get to me right away, but only by the beginning of September. <br><br>  I thought that I had missed an important letter with a warning from GoDaddy, but in my mailbox I found only notifications about debiting funds from the card and messages about discounts.  Nothing about changing PHP version.  In the hosting control panel there is also no warning written in huge red letters.  Googled - aha, there was a message on the company's twitter and an explanation to the surprised users in the support forum.  Very cute. <br><br>  The situation was corrected by creating <b>php5.ini</b> , writing only two lines to it <i>(register_long_arrays = on; allow_call_time_pass_reference = true;)</i> and restarting PHP.  However, this is not a simple decision.  The fact is that these bad people have not even explicitly warned about changing the conditions of the tariff plan.  Is that right?  Or did I miss something? <br><br>  <b>UPD.</b>  In the comments, some ask what is the meaning of the post.  I answer.  I‚Äôm warning GoDaddy to stop supporting <b>PHP4</b> .  The hoster itself has not reported this to its customers, and I do it for him.  Older projects written in <b>PHP4</b> and hosted by GoDaddy may fail.  How to deal with some of them, I also wrote. <br><br>  Everything else is a figment of your imagination.  There are no hidden meanings.  GoDaddy anyway one of the best hosters.  The bulk of the rest - generally silent horror.  Personally, I will leave him as soon as I have free time, but this is exclusively my decision.  I do not impose anything on anyone.  Yes, only minority representatives work in their support, but any support for any office in any country consists of 90% of such specialists.  Their staff consists of low paid, unskilled workers, often students.  My opinion is that any caliper exists only for averting the eyes, in order to show the customer care.  From my experience - they have never solved a single problem on their own, which arose through the fault of their office.  This is how not only the host support works, but any other. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/150884/">https://habr.com/ru/post/150884/</a></p>
