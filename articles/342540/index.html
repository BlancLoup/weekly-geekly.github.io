In the list of popular problems of mobile applications, low conversion often emerges, a large percentage of disconnections of connections, and slow work of third-party APIs.  CDN does not save from all ills.  We want to talk about PacketZoom Mobile Expresslane - a software solution to accelerate the transfer of content between the clouds and mobile applications through its own UDP-based protocol for processing HTTP requests instead of TCP / IP. <br><br>  PacketZoom Mobile Expresslane SDK is not the only solution of its kind, but it is widely distributed and can solve various problems.  In this article, we have compiled a sample of various cases, so that you can figure out whether you will be interested in PacketZoom Mobile Expresslane, whether to look further to it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/be6/d42/b98/be6d42b988854f082fe988620bd8e01b.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      In fact, PacketZoom Mobile Expresslane is an SDK that is embedded in a mobile application and does not require any changes.  The whole procedure usually takes less than an hour. <br><br>  PacketZoom uses a large variety of technology to optimize the connection.  This includes saving TCP sessions, choosing the optimal connection speed, optimizing the cache, and using specific network speed data.  One of the advantages of the PacketZoom technology is that the connection within the proprietary protocol is not established with an IP address, but with a device; therefore, when switching between networks ‚Äî switching between different types of mobile networks ‚Äî it recovers faster with less packet loss, that is .  The protocol is initially focused on networks with low bandwidth and zone coverage.  In some scenarios, the solution provider promises data transfer acceleration up to 10 times.  This, of course, is a very optimistic indicator, for which you just need an ideal case "in a vacuum."  Real stories are more modest. <br><br><h2>  History 1. When CDN needs help </h2><br>  Inshorts is a mobile news aggregator that shortens texts to 60 or less words.  In the news he keeps the headlines and basic facts, removes expert comments and other related information.  The main market is India, the country is not the most stable mobile Internet. <br><br>  Inshorts uses the Akamai CDN, but it does not solve the problem of slow data transfer and permanent disconnections.  After the introduction of PacketZoom Mobile Expresslane, the volume of complaints about the speed of the application has decreased by 70%.  The number of views of pictures in the news increased by 7%.  The change in the number of breaks can be seen on the chart - it has decreased by 3-4 times. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7b6/b42/e65/7b6b42e65eee5a5274f0c6e6025af1c1.png"><br><br><h2>  Story 2. A dynamic application and many APIs in the Indian wilderness </h2><br>  Netmeds Marketplace Limited is an Indian online pharmacy that delivers everyday medicines.  The Netmeds App forms about half of the pharmacy traffic, and the second half comes from the website.  The application is popular in small towns where ordinary pharmacies are few.  And the quality of mobile communication also suffers.  Therefore, after introducing the CDN, the company tried PacketZoom to optimize the speed of the application. <br><br>  As a result, the download speed increased by 1.64 times for 3G networks and 1.5 times for Wi-Fi and LTE.  The number of user gaps due to network problems has decreased by 5 times. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/77b/dbb/b3d/77bdbbb3da50fe9e97c43109fef8d7b8.png">  <i>Breakage of connections with and without PacketZoom</i> <br><br><h2>  Story 3. Online shoe store with lots of pictures and Amazon CloudFront </h2><br>  GOAT is a sports shoe store that verifies the authenticity of each pair sold.  The store application as a CDN uses Amazon CloudFront. <br><br>  The online shoe store assumes a large number of high-quality heavy images, so one of the main tasks has always been to optimize the data transfer between the mobile client and the cloud.  This problem was solved by PacketZoom. <br><br>  The SDK was implemented in an hour, resulting in a three-fold increase in data transfer speed in all types of mobile networks, and the number of breaks was reduced by 63%.  Due to the fact that PacketZoom takes away caching of mobile data from a CDN, the cost of it has decreased to 10 times. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4d6/582/0af/4d65820afc2b65bd2f40db0446d5989a.png">  <i>Increase data transfer speed in various networks</i> <br><br><h2>  History 4. Increased involvement in news content </h2><br>  News Republic - news aggregator, working through several applications - News Republic, AppyGeek and AppyGamer.  In applications there is the possibility of discussing the news between users. <br><br>  The introduction of PacketZoom over CDN reduced the number of breaks by 60% and increased speed by 2.73 times.  As a result, the volume of consumed news content increased by 34%, and the number of downloaded images - by 12%.  CDN costs are down 45%. <br><br><h2>  History 5. Mobile Games </h2><br>  One well-known game developer relied on Web-CDN in his products and experienced problems with the speed and breaks of sessions.  Among the more specific problems were the slow loading of large amounts of data and the work of third-party APIs (Swrve, Amazon DynamoDB), as well as frequent failures when loading in-game ads. <br><br>  PacketZoom integration accelerated the transfer of static content 2.5 times, interaction with Swrve 4 times, and the optimization of work with Amazon DynamoDB.  The number of breaks was reduced by about 10 times, and the download speed of advertising also increased markedly. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/321/dde/88b/321dde88b62ad36304828afb954b6cdb.png"></div>  <i>Delivery of advertising with and without PacketZoom</i> <br><br><h2>  History 6. Mobile graphic editor </h2><br>  The Photofy App is a photo editor for social networking and brand promotion.  In general, a potential friend SMM-box.  It already used SDN Amazon CloudFront, but the creators additionally searched for the mobile-first solution to speed up the loading of dynamic and static content. <br><br>  Following the results of the implementation of the SDK, the PacketZoom was able to speed up data transfer via LTE by 1.76 times and reduce the number of session breaks.  Differently, depending on the country: about two times in the USA, and almost three times in Brazil. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5ad/37b/1fa/5ad37b1faae59ef174d475e1a26fe37c.png"></div>  <i>Increased connection speed with and without PacketZoom</i> <br><br><h3>  History 7. Navigation service in AWS </h3><br>  The Wave application allows you to share your geographical position with friends and offers a number of other features on top.  It works in AWS Elastic Beanstalk.  The main environment runs on Python / Django and is associated with PostgreSQL's two Amazon RDS databases ‚Äî it provides the main API.  The additional environment is based on Erlang and uses the XMPP framework ‚Äî it is responsible for sending the location and the built-in chat. <br><br>  The effectiveness of this infrastructure has suffered from constant handover of users - dynamic connections between mobile networks and Wi-Fi. <br>  PacketZoom Mobile Expresslane reduced the number of session breaks by 2 times and accelerated the transfer of application data by 2.5 times. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/268/764/ef9/268764ef93327fe5499e864dc6d486fe.png"></div>  <i>Improving the last-mile connection</i> <br><br>  Summarizing the examples, you can identify the main advantages that gives PacketZoom Mobile Expresslane.  It reduces the number of ‚Äúlast mile‚Äù cliffs and speeds up data loading, and it shows itself best in regions with a problem connection.  And also reduces the cost of CDN, if working with her in a pair.
