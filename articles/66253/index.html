      <strong>And it needs to be fixed.</strong>  <strong>Urgently.</strong>  <strong>Poke your nose, do not be offended, through tears, but correct.</strong> <strong><br></strong> <br><br>  <em>A little more to the point.</em> <br><br>  We have a small company or a chain of freelancing, as for example in my case.  I usually do widgets and small sites on the flash.  I write about what I know and what I have said on several occasions.  People like me are many and we all often encounter the problems described.  Somewhere the chain is different and its problems, I don‚Äôt touch them here. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <em>Actually, the text.</em> <br><br>  What does it mean to spit?  Everyone wants to eat, so the work will be done, but made to just fall behind.  This is how all mediocre sites come out, which, although they like the client, are still a misery and at the same time attract a lot of hemorrhoids in the future.  Sadly, when such creatures to their creators are not at all ashamed. <br><br>  It's funny, but even working together for several years, people often do not really know what their colleagues are doing.  They don't need it.  They don't care.  Hence all the problems.  It‚Äôs easier to give a couple of examples than to try to abstract the situation in an abstract way. <br><br>  There is a manager, he tells the client what he needs, he agrees.  The project seems to be simple.  A small description is made, some additional materials are collected.  But the manager is not very familiar with the programming kitchen, he is too lazy and does not care a bit.  Therefore, the designer and programmer come not only as incomplete data, but incorrect data and with a bunch of places that are ‚Äúunderstandable anyway.‚Äù  The manager does not think about the fact that he is a very weighty link in the whole chain, because his jambs will become covered with jambs like a snowball, and programmers <strong>will have to fix everything.</strong>  <strong>And it does not matter who and when nakosyachil.</strong>  The programmer has the task of translating the verbal description of the program's work into code that does something as close as possible to this description.  At the same time, very little will depend on the small details of the description, for example, the chosen architecture of the application, which will then be very expensive to change. <br><br>  So, the manager does not know how I (the programmer) work and vaguely presents what I need.  You ask what for is he needed?  Well, here they are with us in most cases.  Passing a description of the designer, he himself misses a bunch of key points, and the designer, in turn, misses a lot of important things.  Because, he, too, is not particularly aware of programerskih affairs, the main thing for him is to sketch a drawing, and after us even a flood. <br><br>  Often, people who can make a beautiful picture are completely unsuited to create beautiful and at the same time functional designs.  After all, his work should later be transferred to the interface.  Here the designer‚Äôs skill is fully and fully visible, or rather its absence.  Often he doesn‚Äôt even think that apart from a beautiful picture and its source in PSD (which, I must say, it will be read by a stranger, and the heap of Layer 1 layers, Layer 2, Layer 543 will not please him) the programmer will need a lot of things.  For example, the state of the buttons, drawn invisible animated details, etc.  How many times have I had to draw such garbage.  And what's funny, it was faster than asking the designer to draw the missing details.  While he reads the letter, he goes for lunch, he finds time somewhere in the evening and sends the result tomorrow afternoon.  But, of course, at the same time no one is doing my coaching work at this time while I rule the design work. <br><br>  Here you can see that the designer does not know what the programmer needs, and the manager doesn‚Äôt tell the designer about it, because he is too lazy or he doesn‚Äôt know.  The designer, of course, draws only what was requested, and not half a pixel anymore. <br><br>  Ask and where was the programmer at the beginning?  Why didn't he say exactly what he needed?  Very, very often, the programmer in general learns about what to do when they already send the finished design and a small description to it.  You are wrong?  Then we go to you (8 This is not the point. <br><br>  I am trying to express the main idea with this text - the <strong>people do not know and do not care about the people</strong> .  Often I do not care, but I'm the last link.  Often I'm lazy, I do hacks with things based on documentation and design, then it turns out that ‚ÄúI meant something else‚Äù and replace these hacks with a normal implementation with rewriting half of the code on the way because of such ‚Äúintuitive things‚Äù. <br><br>  <strong>You have to poke your nose!</strong> <br><br>  It is necessary!  Nose!  Through tears.  Despite the insults.  By the way, I came across comrades who were insulted by my claims.  With comrades who have not been corrected so persistently that I would not do.  This problem is very important.  It is the root of many troubles.  When the boss is sitting in the office and thinks of garbage, everything seems to be working and doing his job, but it turns out shit, he does not know that his employees do not care about the work and the rest. <br><br>  <strong>Positive example.</strong> <br><br>  But not everything is so sad.  I have worked for my life in a pile of such chains.  And there were very positive chains.  Managers who knew the kitchen, the designers who sent the cut transparent images with all the necessary states, animation and description.  There were also in my memory ideal projects that the customers themselves often spoiled, but more on that another time. <br><br>  It is pleasant to work with such people, the mood of professionalism and non-spilling is transmitted through the chain. <br><br>  <strong>Question.</strong> <br><br>  <em>How to fight?</em> <br><br>  The last time I told the designer in a polite manner to the girl was what was needed and how needed ... She was offended and burst into tears. <br><br>  After an hour of chat yesterday, today, all participants again behave the same way and nothing changes. <br><br>  <em>How to change the situation in the root?</em> <br><br>  The programmer does not have to control the whole process just to get all the materials he needs.  Then he becomes a manager, and at the same time he maintains his program duties and deadlines.  From the programmer is required information about the possibility and timing.  <strong>When people do not know what and how you are doing, it is terribly difficult to work with them, but in the end it‚Äôs me who turns out to be the last ...</strong> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/66253/">https://habr.com/ru/post/66253/</a></p>
