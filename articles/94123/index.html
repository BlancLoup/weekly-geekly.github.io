For which he received advice to be more understandable and short.  Moreover, <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/hexoid/" class="user_link">hexoid</a> helped me express the essence of a single sentence ‚Äî I put it into the heading.  Below is a small explanation of it. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The SocialLift service implements the principle: maximum opportunities with minimal means.  As part of a separate service based on a simple model of a network of objects of arbitrary types that users create, the main modern ideas and concepts of the Internet of the future - ‚Äúdata network‚Äù, ‚Äúsemantic network‚Äù, and ‚Äúattention economy‚Äù are embodied.  In such an environment, the efficiency of many processes is greatly enhanced, in particular, search, multi-criteria filtering / aggregation of information flows, structuring of content and resources.  Moreover, the very creation of projects is simplified to the use of tools available to ordinary users.  This creates a new concept - ‚Äúresource programming‚Äù (or resource programming), where users can define the interaction schemes of various resources of a given network - information, intellectual, financial, and so on.  All this together opens up new opportunities for the application of user skills and talents, expands the space of self-realization, increases the chances to prove themselves by creating socially-demanded products or in any socially significant activity. <br><br>  <b>Another option:</b>

      Sociallift provides the means and a favorable environment for the social self-realization of users.  That is, if we talk about what specific needs of users the service satisfies, this need refers to the highest level in the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0_%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D1%2583">Maslow pyramid</a> .  How does he do it?  - by allowing: <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://vrus.habrahabr.ru/blog/94902/">Create a variety of Internet projects</a> and services, including commercial ones. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Lead familiar to users of the activity, especially communication and self-presentation, to produce content in the usual formats. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Provide projects, authors and materials with the maximum amount of relevant audience. <br><br>  How it allows you to do these things is partly in the mentioned long versions, partly in the explanations and examples that I plan to write soon. <br><br>  Combined <b>monetization model</b> .  At first it is contextual advertising.  I understand that this does not call for approval, but here's a consideration - if the authors and materials receive the maximum amount of relevant audience, this is almost an ideal formula for contextual advertising.  In the future, when the service picks up speed, the second model of monetization, the ‚Äútax‚Äù on users' commercial projects, will come into force.  Why not immediately?  - because the necessary conditions for the retention of business projects within the service, and at first these conditions are few.  Here there is an analogy with a state that is ‚Äúmonetized‚Äù according to the same scheme, but most of the ‚Äúusers‚Äù in the state cannot leave its limits and are forced to pay such taxes that it assigns.  And it‚Äôs easy to leave the Internet service; you can only keep the carrot here.  When the amount of benefits from using the service exceeds the ‚Äúdamage‚Äù from paying taxes, most businesses will agree to pay a certain percentage of their income.  Tax monetization is good because business users are interested in the development of a common service and develop it themselves, each in their own direction.  At their own expense, advertising their business in the "external environment", outside of the Social lift, they will also advertise the Social lift, attract new users to it.  Probably, it is reasonable at first not to charge taxes at all - this will ensure rapid growth.  Those.  we have some kind of freemium model. <br><br>  I have already <a href="http://vrus.habrahabr.ru/blog/74278/">defined the</a> concept of ‚Äúproject‚Äù and I am going to do it <a href="http://vrus.habrahabr.ru/blog/94738/">again</a> , already in the context of Social lift.  For now, I‚Äôll note that not all user projects are commercial, below are any intra-service projects.  As some predictable consequences of the work of the Elevator, we will have the following: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ In addition to creation, change and the evolution of projects are also simplified.  In general, it facilitates and accelerates the introduction and evolution of various ideas, approaches, technologies. <br>  ‚Ä¢ The high level of competition of related projects, which contributes to their quality and rejection of the unviable. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Already mentioned - users themselves think about the development of the environment, its infrastructure, meeting the demand from other users.  They are interested in this both financially and in terms of public recognition and social self-realization. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Concentration of resources around relevant network nodes and the formation of influence groups, intellectual and creative elite. <br>  ‚Ä¢ The gradual formation of users of the database / metadata - the basis for the subsequent (and parallel) application of advanced technologies (including search, including social search), and <i>knowledge bases</i> - as the basis for the development of artificial intelligence technologies ( <i>expert systems</i> - in line with , about which I wrote in my notes <a href="http://vrus.habrahabr.ru/blog/57830/">Futurology the Internet</a> and <a href="http://vrus.habrahabr.ru/blog/56111/">People‚Äôs search and its prospects</a> ). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/94123/">https://habr.com/ru/post/94123/</a></p>
