In the first year only as a spectator, but in subsequent years I had the opportunity to participate in the organization of fan stands by <b>Doctor Who</b> (Doctor Who, science fiction series), <b>Redwall</b> (Redwall, B. Jacks‚Äôs book series), <b>Firefly</b> (Firefly, space western), <b>Gravity Falls</b> (Gravity Falls, the animated series), <b>Futurama</b> (Futurama, the creation of M. Growing) and <b>Jumanji</b> (Jumanji, films and the animated series) at various festivals.  Stand colleagues know that this is not an easy task, the preparation includes the construction of a stand, tailoring of costumes, and the development of an interactive program - what you can do at the stand.  Everything happens on a voluntary basis and without a good team in any way.  At the festival itself, most of the time you are at the stand, conducting interactivity for visitors.  It is always more interesting if you can do something unique on the stand, suitable for this Universe, so everyone is trying to come up with something special.  I would like to tell about a pair of my interactions. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Beware, spoilers!</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  In the articles there will be a couple of plot moves from <b>Gravity Falls</b> and <b>Jumanji</b> , not the most important ones, but having a direct bearing on the interactions.  If this is not scary - welcome under the cut =) <br></div></div><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Old MacGacket Laptop (Gravity Falls) </h4><br>  The <b>Gravity Falls</b> universe is full of mysteries, mysteries, and mystical devices.  One of them is a laptop found in an abandoned bunker.  After switching on, a sign with a password entry form came out.  The protagonist for many days tried to guess the password, and in the end, the last input attempt timer appeared on the screen.  Although we did not know the true content of the laptop, I decided that from this you can make a good interactive visit to the <b>Gravity Falls</b> booth for the 2015 <b>Starcon</b> Festival.

      For a start, a suitable device was required.  I was in the presence of Toshiba 20 years ago, from which I once started to get acquainted with computers.  He no longer holds a charge, half of the screen is displayed with stripes, but the main thing is that it works and looks quite similar.  He took it out, sealed it with a plaster (for the sake of the entourage) and began to develop it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yc/to/7a/ycto7a7biarlfg9p5jlibf1yvqk.png"><br><br>  I decided to recall the first course and began to write a program in Pascal.  The first version was fairly simple.  A greeting, notification of the need to enter a password and an input field were displayed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/e-/up/k7/e-upk7ldl5omwa1gv4go8x7xvzk.png"><br><br>  If the password entry limit was exceeded, the timer for the last attempt was activated.  If this attempt was unsuccessful, the screen was blocked before entering the secret combination. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zd/0y/r3/zd0yr3jepzuhvtewgxm5j8mkdz8.png"><br><br>  A number of successful passwords were written in the program configuration file.  Simple passwords gave each of their greetings, but there were several basic passwords corresponding to some things from the stand or characters from the animated series, which could be found here as cosplayers.  When entering such passwords, the symbol and its location were issued.  Knowing all 8 characters, you could enter the main password and get a prize. <br><br>  Also in the first version, I added the functionality of a large timer from the series - so that it can be launched as a background in case the interactive is not performed now for some reason.  On the stand were planned ‚ÄúWhat?  Where?  When? ‚ÄùAnd a win-win lottery, and I added a simple randomizer with memorization of already dropped numbers - to automate the selection of envelopes with questions and winning lottery tickets.  Additional functionality was also called by entering special passwords. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xk/yn/w8/xkynw8hjhm_-l7kk9w8jpdorjli.png"><br><br>  The first festival was a success.  The laptop was popular, the passwords were guessed, but it seemed to me that the potential of the laptop was not sufficiently realized.  For the following festivals, I added the possibility of passing the test on the animated series.  It was necessary to answer correctly 4 of 5 random questions from a hundred in order to successfully complete the interactive.  It was possible to choose from 3 levels of difficulty, so all visitors had chances - especially since we could suggest and allowed to pass the test.  Although younger visitors and they themselves coped quite well. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nt/yg/bl/ntygbl6y9hzbd2sloxdgw1lgq4w.png"><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Funny fact</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  After the first version of the program, I had an idea to write a small article about it - with a brief functionality and screenshots of a laptop.  I was dreaming that I could put it in English, and the author of the series, Alex Hirsch, would find it and appreciate the work of the fans.  Article writing was delayed for three years.  During this time, Alex Hirsch managed to personally come to the <b>Big Festival</b> 2016, evaluate the fans, the stand, the laptop and even pass the test in the program (I first made the English version).  And the article is still in progress =) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qq/cx/lg/qqcxlgqk9leu_x_r8sxcnc12mkg.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9l/6-/vq/9l6-vq5dwp2vh7alarsqy1djagm.png"><br></div></div><br>  In the <a href="https://habr.com/post/431914/">next part</a> I will talk about a more recent interactive - mobile application for this year's <b>Jumanji</b> stand. <br><br>  <a href="https://habr.com/post/431914/">Technical interakty on fantastic conventions.</a>  <a href="https://habr.com/post/431914/">Part 1</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/431832/">https://habr.com/ru/post/431832/</a></p>
