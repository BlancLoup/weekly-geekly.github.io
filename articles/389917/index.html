  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Electronic multitool Power-flash drive</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Power flash drive <br><br>  Earlier on geektimes already described <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dadget/blog/265284/">power-flash drive</a> .  If you are primarily interested in voltages, copying speeds, charge currents and thin battery capacity, then it is necessary to read.  I will share purely everyday aspects.  So: <br><br>  I love to travel and take pictures.  And each time going on vacation or a business trip I try to remember what I need to take with me.  As a result, the fees turn into a test of everything and the obligatory forgetting of some trifles. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/839/a3d/629/839a3d629b2a4c3f9848db5e77b21950.JPG" alt="Power flash drive"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A power flash drive is an excellent solution that allows you to successfully combine the functions of a fairly weighty set of cords, adapters and batteries in one tiny device. <br>  It also has a battery for emergency charging the phone, and an adapter cable from phone to USB.  And a small flash drive for 8 GB and even a small flashlight. <br>  One of the features of the flash drive is an interesting solution for switching the mode of operation of the USB connector. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/749/8ac/fb4/7498acfb469d4513a896d33cf9193696.JPG" alt="USB mode switch"><br>  In the first position of the switch is a normal connector, and the flash drive turns into a small marching charging cord.  It is also suitable for data exchange with the connected device.  There are three connectors for the old and the new iPhone, the usual micro-usb for androids, windows-phones, bluetooth headphones, children's toys and so on. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

        </script>
      <br>
      In the second position of the switch, the external cords are disconnected and the USB connector turns into a micro USB flash drive adapter, with a standard micro SD card inside.  In this mode, the power flash drive is used as a regular flash drive.  You can connect to a computer, auto-radio and everywhere where a regular USB flash drive can be used. <br><br>  Naturally, you can simultaneously charge and power-flash and the phone connected to it. <br>  The advantage of the power flash drive is that the flash drive is just a small micro SD card (already inserted into the USB adapter).  And if necessary, for example, when the memory in the camera ran out, you can quickly "take" the card from the flash drive. <br><br>  The presence of a switch on the USB connector seemed to me not only original but also an unusual solution.  It was feared that his appointment might be difficult to understand.  But the simplest test on his wife showed that it‚Äôs enough for a girl 5 seconds to understand the purpose of the switch. <br><br>  The built-in battery according to the documentation is enough for 20% of the phone charge.  On my phone Lumia 920 with a fully discharged state, the phone charges by 17 percent.  True, during the measurement, I answered a few more calls.  For urgent recharging of the phone, such capacity is more than enough, but for constant use it is obviously not enough. <br>  Speaking of charging.  A shifting switch is used to turn on the charger. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b08/7b5/32d/b087b532d3a949e289d2370a41a9d0d7.JPG" alt="Charger on off"><br><br>  Including or flashlight or charging mode.  In my opinion, the flashlight is weak.  Especially considering the presence of a powerful battery at a distance of two centimeters from the LED. <br><br>  After a week of using a flash drive, I found out that the shiny detail on the corner is ‚Äúbroken glass‚Äù.  How they can break the glass, and most importantly why, I did not understand.  But it shines beautifully. <br><br>  I want to share the experience of personal use of Power-flash drives.  For myself, I decided that the situations where I remain without a charge on the phone, or without a charging cable, or without a flash drive, an adapter, a flashlight, etc., though rarely but regularly occur.  And a power flash drive in such situations is a great helper.  And I decided to settle it in my purse.  And in order to settle something necessary in a purse, you must first evict something unnecessary from there.  And this unnecessary in my case was a pack of discount cards.  I did not even suspect the existence of some of them.  There is, however, one nuance.  The size of the power flash drive is slightly larger than the ‚Äústandard‚Äù size of a credit card, so I carry it in a separate wallet pocket. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f46/2db/793/f462db79397f43f0b1c456b9dda935eb.JPG" alt="Power flash size"><br><br>  The height of the power flash drive completely coincides with the usual card, but 5 mm longer in length.  I tried to place it in a business card box - it is included, but I think that it very much depends on the specific instance of business card holders.  Throwing out a dozen useless discount cards, I also saved a little space. <br>  Speaking of sizes, they matter.  And in the summer to the beach I‚Äôll most likely take the power flash drive with me, and not the bulky, although very convenient on long journeys, power bank.  A flash drive easily and naturally fits in a shirt pocket and, importantly, does not pull it down.  By the way, in a jeans or women's handbag flash drive will also be like at home.  Where to wear - the choice is individual.  I chose the purse. <br>  And how your girlfriend will preserve the mule-tul is up to you.  In my opinion - <a href="http://dadget.ru/katalog/multimedia/powerbank/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_term%3Dpowerbank%26utm_content%3Dpowerbank%26utm_campaign%3Dpowerbank_143">this</a> is <a href="http://dadget.ru/katalog/multimedia/powerbank/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_term%3Dpowerbank%26utm_content%3Dpowerbank%26utm_campaign%3Dpowerbank_143">a great gift for the upcoming holidays</a> . <br><br>  The overall impression of the ‚ÄúElectronic multitul '‚Äù is a great thing, but there are a couple of nuances: the size and the seemingly ‚Äúfragile‚Äù wires.  Although with careful use, this is not a problem. <br><br>  <a href="https://dadget.ru/katalog/aktivnyj-otdyh/aftershokz%3Futm_referrer%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_term%3Daftershokz%26utm_content%3Daftershokz%26utm_campaign%3Daftershokz_224">test</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/389917/">https://habr.com/ru/post/389917/</a></p>
