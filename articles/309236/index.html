  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to make them not go away</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The issue of retaining IT specialists takes the minds of more than one IT and HR manager.  IT specialists, especially developers, are very spoiled with job offers, both domestically and abroad.  Finding a new developer to replace the departed is not the task of one day (sometimes not one month, if it is a senior or lead developer).  How to keep them?  To begin with, this is normal when a person leaves the company after 3-4-5 years of work.  If people start to leave more often - this is already a problem. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bcd/5ac/3eb/bcd5ac3ebdd92bab31b73ecb9e6efb8c.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A good leader knows about the planned departure of his employee in advance.  I note that a good manager never has any planned departures for employees.  Therefore, he gives the task to the HR service in advance and he, by the time the specialist leaves, already has several applicants for the vacant place. <br><br>  <b>The first recommendation.</b>  Keep in touch with your employees.

Regularly conduct team building inside the department (this is exactly how the IT manager calls this article in the budget when he thinks about going to the pub with his staff (no joke, though ...)).  You scored money for such a budget item?  Team building can be an informal departure for barbecues, cycling, hiking, passing quest rooms or playing laser tag.  The key word is regular.  Be sure to periodically communicate face to face with each employee.  The frequency depends on the size of the team, but not less than once a quarter.  During this meeting, first find out from the employee about existing problems and questions, and only then give feedback and assessment of his work (about the rule "sandwich", I will not remind you). <br><br>  <b>Recommendation Two.</b>  Fair assessment of labor. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/995/700/4a8/9957004a85bf93b919bff00220ecb2f7.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  <b>How:</b> It implies, first of all, compliance with the Labor Code of the Russian Federation (i.e., no payments in envelopes and attempts to fool with charges).  Secondly, clear and understandable duties.  IT shnik do not like when they are constantly forced to do their work is not inherent.  One-time admissible to involve in moving the office or general cleaning, but no more.  Regular tests on the strongest programmer will lead to the care of a person.  Thirdly, if you use KPI, then do not forget that they correspond to SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, current, limited in time).  Also note that system administrators, developers and IT analysts are not very stupid people.  They are able to count well, so you should not play games with such people, trying to manipulate numbers and conditions in order to fail to achieve the planned indicators.  These people will be offended at first, and then they will find a place where they are not deceived (believe me, there are such places, even in a crisis!).  Also, KPI is not a dogma, that is, it is necessary to analyze on a regular basis whether they are relevant and correspond to your needs and the needs of the company. <br><br>  <b>The third recommendation.</b>  Development and professional growth. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9ec/554/85e/9ec55485eaec858cb86d025a3bc620f1.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  <b>How:</b> Without development prospects, your people will run away, even if you pay them a good salary.  More precisely, the pros will run up, but slag will remain, ready to sit from bell to bell.  Therefore, it is worth thinking about creating a personnel training system, if you don‚Äôt have one yet.  If you have a competent HR service in an organization, then you should already have a training system.  But even if it is, you will have to work anyway.  It is necessary to think over the grading system.  This is a reflection of employee competency levels.  Examples: 2nd category engineer - 1st category engineer - lead engineer - chief engineer or junior developer - middle developer - senior developer - tech lead.  It‚Äôs not enough to think about grades, you need to think about the skills matrix for each level (skills matrix).  This is a description of technologies, tools, employee qualities, etc., which should be manifested at this level.  Often, a gradation of manifestation of each quality is also used (for example, it reads with the dictionary and is fluent in it).  And that's not all, you need to think about some bonuses, both material and non-material, that an employee will receive when switching from grade to grade.  Consider assessment procedures and formal criteria.  Create a PDP (personal development plan) for your employees.  Consider the possibility of allocating budgets for the training of their employees.  Just do not forget that you need to constantly trust them more and more important projects.  In general, there is something to do. <br><br>  <b>The fourth and last recommendation.</b>  If people are chosen correctly, they do not need motivation.  All that is needed is to ensure the absence of demotivating factors. ¬© Jim Collins <br><br>  <b>PS</b> Do not forget about the picture in the title of the post - just do not be m ... and do not work with such people.  Before introducing something new in motivation and pay, try on the innovation on yourself, put yourself in the place of your developer or system administrator.  Are you comfortable?  Your income has not become less?  Can you achieve the indicators that will lead you to receive a premium?  And your employees will love you, and you will comprehend Zen and be reborn into the next life on some other planet, where these (from the book) do not exist at all - in principle. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/309236/">https://habr.com/ru/post/309236/</a></p>
