In addition to other points of the plan, it includes the project "digital railway". <br><br>  Unfortunately, the document does not indicate the size of the amounts to be invested in the ‚Äúdigital‚Äù part of the modernization of Russian Railways.  But the total amount of investments from private investors, which are planned to be raised from 2019 to 2025, is 4 trillion rubles.  The volume of state support is about 200 billion rubles, as <a href="http://www.cnews.ru/news/top/2019-03-21_rzhd_poluchila_plan_stroitelstva_tsifrovoj_zheleznoj">reported by</a> Cnews. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Only the program of corporate informatization of the transportation process in the period from 2019 to 2025 allocated about 132 billion rubles.  For the creation of a unified intellectual system of management and automation of production processes on railway transport over the same period, 3.5 billion rubles have been allocated.  Well, it is planned to invest about 78 billion rubles over six years to upgrade equipment and communication devices. <br><br>  The Digital Railway began to be developed after the presidential decree of May 7 of last year ‚ÄúOn the national goals and strategic objectives of the development of the Russian Federation for the period up to 2024‚Äù.

      In the paragraph ‚ÄúDigitalization and Information Technologies‚Äù it is noted that the list of key areas for the development of information systems of Russian Railways will include the formation of a single information space for freight traffic and logistics, plus the same space for the passenger complex to increase profitability. <br><br>  A digital platform for managing and monitoring traffic will track the location and status of cargo, including the door-to-door service.  Thus, it is planned to provide a ‚Äúlegally significant exchange‚Äù of electronic documents with the participants of transportation and the end-to-end use of digital transport data. <br><br>  The number of created digital tools for organizing passenger transportation includes multimodality, planning and maintenance of a ‚Äúdoor-to-door journey‚Äù, personalized services for passengers, electronic fare payment services, a flexible tariff menu and a loyalty program. <br><br>  "Digital Railway" will provide an opportunity to form end-to-end digital technologies of the transportation process in order to improve the efficiency of transportation and infrastructure.  It is also assumed that in the next six years a unified integrated automated management system of the state corporation will be created, optimization of corporate management systems, analysis and development of reporting of foreign activities will be carried out. <br><br>  A system of intelligent traffic control will be formed, which will provide access to current data of transport and infrastructure, modeling of the processes of construction, operation and repair with reference to time and budgeting. <br><br>  The project will integrate the Internet of things, big data processing, a distributed registry, digital modeling and artificial intelligence.  The creation of mobile workplaces of the new generation is also planned, plus the introduction of electronic document circulation. <br><br>  Accordingly, the developers modify the computing and telecommunications infrastructure of Russian Railways to ensure a guaranteed level of availability of information services. <br><br>  Now Russia is implementing the Digital Economy program, <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/434372/">for the implementation of which it is planned to spend 1.8 trillion</a> rubles in the next five years.  More than 1 trillion - federal budget funds.  Earlier it was reported that the section ‚ÄúInformation Infrastructure‚Äù could become the most expensive program of the national project ‚ÄúDigital Economy‚Äù.  More than 413.4 billion rubles will be allocated to this section.  Another approximately 282 billion rubles.  spend on digital technology, 226.4 billion rubles - on digital government, 139 billion rubles.  - frames for the digital economy and 18 billion rubles for information security. <br><br>  Of the amount announced, 820 billion rubles were found to be used for the implementation of informatization programs of state bodies.  The funds will be used to organize workstations for employees of various ministries and departments, develop their own IT systems and support GIS. <br><br><blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jy/sd/rr/jysdrr7tqgfjt50wtcshw89ctho.png" align="left"><h3>  Minute of care from UFO </h3><br>  This material could cause conflicting feelings, so before writing a comment, refresh something important in your memory: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">How to write a comment and survive</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  Do not write offensive comments, do not go to the person. </li><li>  Refrain from using obscene language and toxic behavior (even in a veiled form). </li><li>  To report comments that violate the rules of the site, use the "Report" button (if available) or <a href="https://habr.com/feedback/%3Ftype%3D4">a feedback form</a> . </li></ul><br>  What to do if: <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/karma/">minus karma</a> |  <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/sandbox/">blocked account</a> <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/other/">Code of authors Habra</a> and <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/other/">habraetiket</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/rules/">Full site rules</a> </div></div></blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/445080/">https://habr.com/ru/post/445080/</a></p>
