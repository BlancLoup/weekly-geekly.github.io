  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Programmer's Spirits</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Three powerful patron spirits fight for the soul of a programmer: the Artist, the Worker and the Pragmatist. <br><br><h6>  If you hear a voice inside you: ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt draw,‚Äù draw at whatever cost until the voice subsides. <br>  - Vincent van Gogh </h6><br><br>  The first spirit, the Artist, pushes the programmer to work on complex tasks, invent new approaches and search for means of self-realization.  He gives strength and desire to create ingenious solutions, to learn and create <i>(at the same time he knows sports programming and esoteric programming languages ‚Äã‚Äã- comment. Per.)</i> .  He lives in the best programs;  it is he who gives the programmer insight, instills in him a passion for the beauty of the code and makes him neglect everything that is not relevant to the task.  This is a strong spirit, but also dangerous - a person obsessed with them is unpredictable and inclined to forget about really necessary things to please beautiful.  He will reject mediocre, but suitable solutions and devote himself to achieving unlimited perfection on one single piece of code, rewriting it again and again, even at night before an important show, when all testers have been sleeping for a long time.

    <a name="habracut"></a><h6>  There is no person who would be like an Island, in itself, each person is a part of the Mainland. <br>  John donne </h6><br><br>  The second spirit, the Worker, puts in the first place the interests of the team, the company and the client.  It forces the programmer to devote himself entirely to the success of the project and the General Good.  The programmer will stay up late, correcting errors by the deadline;  He will test the product after the testers and check the settings after the admins.  This altruistic spirit makes the programmer an assembled, reliable, and disciplined citizen of the company.  At the same time, the Hard Worker suppresses creativity and disgusts decisions that are not endorsed by management and can fail;  sometimes it causes stress, anxiety and a sense of wasted abilities.  If the company does not worry about the hard work of the programmer and the sacrifices he has brought, the influence of the Worker quickly evaporated. <br><br><h6>  Life is what happens while you make plans. <br>  John Lennon </h6><br><br>  The third spirit, the Pragmatist, is most concerned about personal interests, financial well-being, stability, and career growth.  Under his leadership, programmers write bad code, while thinking about salary and recognition from management.  The influence of this spirit increases with age: family and personal problems take precedence over the dreams of creating great things, and the turnover is stuck so much that thoughts of loyalty and dedication to work disappear completely.  Sometimes a programmer who is obsessed with this spirit begins to focus on things that are useful for personal growth, write obfuscated code and complicate it to ensure its value for the employer, or to waste time on personal projects.  This spirit feeds on the natural desire to have life outside of work and to achieve your own goals.  Its danger is that the programmer becomes more harmful than useful and stops worrying about the quality of the project and the long-term success of the company. <br><br>  Each spirit has its pros and cons: The artist knows creative abilities, but is prone to excessive diligence and contempt for real needs; interests of the company and customers. <br><br>  These spirits tear many hapless programmers apart, preventing them from achieving enlightenment and emotional balance.  Usually this struggle ends with the victory of one spirit (unfortunately, most often - Pragmatics).  Sometimes this or that principle prevails in a person, depending on the circumstances - different working conditions may awaken the creativity of the Artist or the instinct of self-preservation Pragmatics. <br><br>  <i>The theory is elegant, although it does not take into account the multitude of small demons gnawing and biting us all the time - the demon of idleness, the demon of idleness and Internet surfing and many others.</i>  <i>And which of them most often you communicate?</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/119035/">https://habr.com/ru/post/119035/</a></p>
