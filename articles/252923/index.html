  <section class="page js-page"><h1>In search of a solution: how to become Mr. Wolfe?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Everyone would like to be Mr. Wolfe from Pulp Fiction.  Yes, laaaaadno, honestly!  People either want to be Mr. Wolfe, who comes in a few minutes and solves problems, or simply didn‚Äôt watch Pulp Fiction.  If you didn‚Äôt watch ‚ÄúPulp Fiction‚Äù - put off reading right now, look at Comrade Quentin Tarantino‚Äôs ‚ÄúPulp Fiction‚Äù and then return to the letter.  And if you looked, then you definitely want to solve problems just as quickly and amazingly. <br><br>  Remember this gorgeous episode?  Two gangsters who were in the city on a white day, in a car with a corpse and a bunch of blood splashes through the cabin.  And no one, interestingly, wants to go to jail, and it‚Äôs not possible to explain to the police that this is all ‚Äî well, that‚Äôs just what happened.  They are hiding in the house of a common acquaintance, who is also not entirely happy, and if this company is caught by the owner's wife, then everyone will have a full pretzel with poppy seeds.  The situation is stalemate.  On the face you can not sit in the house can not.  Raise the number of witnesses, too, is impossible.  And here these iron people, who before this brutally and rigidly knew how to do their work, turn to the customer with a request to help them.  They need a consultant who will help them solve this situation. <br><br>  Look, it's still simple: if you understand what needs to be done, this is called a task.  If you do not know how to solve the problem, but it is necessary to solve it - it becomes a problem.  And we are looking for a solution to the problem.  If there are no resources to find a solution, this is a crisis.  Between the task and the crisis, which are the edges of the distribution curve, there are 80% percent of situations that can be attributed to problems.  Mr. Wolf just knows how to solve situations that for many will be a crisis if they are not solved.  Did he do something special?  Managed time?  Canceled the events that happened?  Rules the matrix?  Probably not.  He just clearly understood what to do in a situation in which others do not understand.  Cool?  Of course.  Talented?  Probably.  Can this be learned?  Yes.

Why do we do something annoying and annoying in other people.  Most often it infuriates us if someone can afford something that you cannot afford.  Here you are driving in traffic jams to the other end of the city, so as not to be late for work.  And your colleague lives across the street from the office, 10 minutes.  And constantly late.  And asks you to ‚Äúcover her in front of the chef.‚Äù  Enrages the same ... Because she can afford to be late, and you - for some reason - no. <br><br>  - How does she allow herself ?! <br>  - How are you talking to me?  (how do you allow yourself to talk like that) <br><br>  Listen to me.  Familiar intonation? <br><br>  So why do not we love those who advise us how to solve the problem?  Because they can, and you - no.  And often when someone shows you that the problem is simple, and is solved this way and that way, you get angry in response.  Because, why is he so clever, and you are not.  Because we do not like when someone climbs with advice.  Especially with the right advice. <br><br>  This skill - the skill to disassemble and solve problem situations - is not an innate talent.  This is exactly the skill.  And like many other skills - he develops.  As well as solving chess problems or using TRIZ for solving inventive problems. <br><br>  So is it possible to learn to analyze and solve difficult situations?  If not everyone, in general, including the universal and global, then at least workers and managerial?  Do those that affect work pleasure, lead to quarrels and squabbles, make you curse with other people and lead to crises that change our lives for the worse? <br><br>  Yes you can.  Chess problems are solved by people with one head, two arms and two legs.  Homo - almost a relative of us - sapiens. <br><br>  Let's open the cards.  We decided to launch the training service for Mr. Wolf‚Äôs - a kind of fitness center for managers and those who want to learn how to solve problems with people.  But about this - the next time, until we finally reveal the cards.  Hang the intrigue.  Stay with us. <br><br>  PS If there is a desire to dream up and / or you have thoughts that in this service it should definitely be - we will be grateful for the comments.  I want to do not just good, but very good. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/252923/">https://habr.com/ru/post/252923/</a></p>
