Now many journalists are actively testing the novelty and produce interesting materials.  We want to share with Habr one of the detailed reviews of the Kingston DC500R, the testing of which readers will like.  The original is on the <a href="https://www.storagereview.com/kingston_dc500r_enterprise_ssd_review">Storagereview</a> website and published in English.  For your convenience, we have translated the material into Russian and place it under the cut.  Enjoy reading! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lw/si/qu/lwsiqu2iso2zqvwxfhpvteqfgjm.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <a href="http://kingston.gg/HabrDC500">Kingston DC500R drives are</a> based on TLC NAND 3D flash memory technology.  Available options are 480 GB, 960 GB, 1.92 TB and 3.84 TB, which provides an additional choice for companies that would like to save money, or for those who simply do not need high-capacity drives.  In this review, a variant with a capacity of 3.48 TB is considered, the stated sequential read and write speeds of which are 555 MB / s and 520 MB / s, respectively, and read and write speeds of 4 KB blocks with constant loads - 98 000 and 28 000 input operations - output per second (IOPS), respectively.  Within this product family, Kingston also offers a DC500M model optimized for mixed-use tasks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-u/mf/et/-umfet5abemay_du080j20xxmjq.jpeg">

The ThinkSystem SR850 is an optimized quad-core platform that delivers the processing power of a processor far beyond what is required for testing high-performance local storage.  For synthetic tests, in which the CPU capabilities are not so important, a more traditional server with two processors was used.  In both cases, we hoped to get the performance of the local storage system corresponding to the level declared by the manufacturer. <br><br>  Lenovo ThinkSystem SR850 <br><br><ul><li>  4 Intel Platinum 8160 CPUs (2.1 GHz, 24 cores) </li><li>  16 DDR4 ECC DRAM memory modules with a frequency of 2666 MHz with a capacity of 32 GB each </li><li>  2 12 Gbps RAID 930-8i Adapters </li><li>  8 NVMe drives </li><li>  VMware ESXI 6.5 Software </li></ul><br>  Dell PowerEdge R740xd <br><br><ul><li>  2 Intel Gold 6130 processors (2.1 GHz, 16 cores) </li><li>  4 DDR4 ECC DRAM memory modules with a frequency of 2666 MHz of 16 GB each </li><li>  RAID adapter PERC 730, 12 Gb / s, buffer 2 GB </li><li>  Embedded NVMe adapter </li><li>  OS Ubuntu-16.04.3-desktop-amd64 </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uc/wb/it/ucwbit1jjmujhhbjxfgtumubfum.png"><br><br>  <b>Testing Information</b> <br><br>  <a href="https://www.storagereview.com/storagereview_enterprise_test_lab">The enterprise-class StorageReview test lab</a> provides ample opportunities for testing storage devices in an environment that is close to actual conditions.  The laboratory includes various servers, network devices, power supply systems and other network infrastructure.  This allows our employees to create realistic conditions for an accurate assessment of equipment performance. <br>  Information on the environment and protocols are included in the reviews so that IT professionals and those responsible for purchasing storage systems can assess the conditions under which the corresponding results were achieved.  Manufacturers of the equipment under test do not pay for the review and do not control it. <br><br>  <b>Application Workload Analysis</b> <br><br>  In order to properly evaluate the performance of enterprise-class storage devices, it is important to model the infrastructure and application workloads that correspond to real-world environments.  Therefore, to evaluate the Samsung 883 DCT solid-state drives, we measured <a href="https://www.storagereview.com/sysbench_oltp_benchmark">the MySQL OLTP database performance using the SysBench utility</a> and <a href="https://www.storagereview.com/sql_server_oltp_benchmark">the Microsoft SQL Server OLTP database performance</a> using TCP-C workload emulation.  In this case, for applications, each drive will process from 2 to 4 equally configured virtual machines. <br><br>  <b>SQL Server performance</b> <br><br>  There are two virtual disks configured for each SQL Server virtual machine: a 100 GB boot disk, and a 500 GB disk to accommodate the database and log files.  In terms of system resources, each virtual machine was equipped with 16 virtual processors, 64 GB of DRAM memory and an LSI Logic SAS SCSI controller.  Previously, using Sysbench workloads, we tested the speed of I / O operations and the efficiency of capacity utilization.  The SQL tests, in turn, help estimate the latency. <br><br>  As part of testing, SQL Server 2014 is deployed on guest virtual machines running Windows Server 2012 R2.  Loads are created using Quest Benchmark Factory for Databases.  <a href="https://www.storagereview.com/sql_server_oltp_benchmark">The</a> StorageReview <a href="https://www.storagereview.com/sql_server_oltp_benchmark">Microsoft SQL Server OLTP database testing protocol</a> uses the current version of the Benchmark C (TPC-C) Benchmark C performance evaluation software from Transaction Processing Performance Council.  This real-time transaction processing performance evaluator simulates the processes of complex application environments.  TPC-C testing allows you to more accurately determine the strengths and weaknesses of the storage infrastructure in database environments, rather than artificial performance testing.  As part of our tests, each instance of the SQL Server virtual machine worked with a SQL Server database of 333 GB (1500 scale).  Measurement of performance and latency in transaction processing was carried out with a load of 15,000 virtual users. <br><br>  Test SQL Server configuration (for each VM): <br>  ‚Ä¢ Windows Server 2012 R2 <br>  ‚Ä¢ Disk space: 600 GB allocated, 500 GB used <br>  ‚Ä¢ SQL Server 2014 <br>  - Database size: 1,500 scale <br>  - Number of virtual clients: 15,000 <br>  - RAM memory buffer: 48 GB <br>  ‚Ä¢ Test duration: 3 hours <br>  - 2.5 hours - preliminary stage <br>  - 30 minutes - direct testing <br><br>  According to the results of performance evaluation in processing SQL Server transactions, the Kingston DC500R drive was only slightly behind Samsung 883 DCT, showing total performance at 6290.6 transactions per second (TPS). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ee/rq/7m/eerq7mhhfvude3qavwvgnnphyum.png"><br><br>  Even better than the TPS metric, assessing the performance of SQL Server allows an estimate of the level of delays.  Here both drives - Samsung 860 DCT and Kingston DC500R - showed the same time: 26.5 ms. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mn/dm/6l/mndm6lr-x5jieoxr14pkayd9twa.png"><br><br>  <b>Performance when using Sysbench</b> <br><br>  The following test used the <a href="https://www.storagereview.com/sysbench_oltp_benchmark">Percona MySQL database</a> .  OLTP performance was evaluated using the SysBench utility.  This measures the average TPS and latency, as well as the average latency in the most unfavorable scenario. <br><br>  Each <a href="https://www.storagereview.com/sysbench_oltp_benchmark">Sysbench</a> virtual machine used three virtual disks: a boot disk of about 92 GB, a disk with a pre-installed base of this size of about 447 GB, and a disk with a test database of 270 GB.  In terms of system resources, each virtual machine was equipped with 16 virtual processors, 60 GB of DRAM and a LSI Logic SAS SCSI controller. <br><br>  Test Sysbench configuration (for each VM): <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ CentOS 6.3 64-bit <br>  ‚Ä¢ Percona XtraDB 5.5.30-rel30.1 <br>  - Number of database tables: 100 <br>  - Size of the database: 10,000,000 <br>  - Number of database threads: 32 <br>  - RAM memory buffer: 24 GB <br>  ‚Ä¢ Test duration: 3 hours <br>  - 2 hours - preliminary stage, 32 threads <br>  - 1 hour - direct testing, 32 threads <br><br>  According to the results of evaluating the performance in processing transactions Sysbench, the DC500R drive was behind the competitors, demonstrating performance at 1,680.47 transactions per second. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lj/tj/c1/ljtjc1qkogeysfxhza1j1hp0wu4.png"><br><br>  In terms of the average delay time, the DC500R also ranked the last line of the rating with the figure of 76.2 ms. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ob/xq/mh/obxqmhumid8wboz60cdenjxsnqu.png"><br><br>  Finally, after testing the delay time under the most unfavorable scenario (99th percentile), the DC500R was again at the end of the list with a result of 134.9 ms. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2m/x0/gn/2mx0gn9yojhkugrvmhcrgggg4uq.png"><br><br>  <b>VDBench workload analysis</b> <br><br>  When testing storage devices, testing using applications is more preferable than synthetic tests.  However, although their results do not correspond to real conditions, synthetic tests, due to the repeatability of tasks, are convenient for determining basic indicators and comparing competing solutions.  Such tests offer a wide range of profiles - from ‚Äúfour corners‚Äù tests and sample database transfer tests to tracking captures from various VDI environments.  In all these cases, a single vdBench workload generator with a script engine is used to automate and collect results in a large cluster of computational tests.  This makes it possible to use the same workload for a wide range of drives, including flash arrays and individual disks.  As part of testing, we completely filled the drives with data, and then broke them up into sections with a capacity of 25% of the original, in order to simulate the loads of applications and evaluate the behavior of the drive.  This approach differs from the fully entropy tests, in which, at constant loads, the entire disk is used at once.  For this reason, the following results reflect more stable write speeds. <br><br>  Profiles: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Random read 4 KB: read only, 128 threads, I / O rate from 0 to 120% <br>  ‚Ä¢ Random write 4 KB: write only, 64 streams, input / output speed from 0 to 120% <br>  ‚Ä¢ 64 KB sequential read: read only, 128 threads, I / O rate from 0 to 120% <br>  ‚Ä¢ 64K sequential write: write only, 64 streams, I / O rate from 0 to 120% <br>  ‚Ä¢ Synthetic databases: SQL and Oracle <br>  ‚Ä¢ VDI Copy (full copy and create linked copies) <br><br>  In the first VDBench workload test (4 KB random reading), the Kingston DC500R showed impressive results: a delay of 1 ms up to an output of 80,000 IOPS speeds and a maximum speed of 80,209 IOPS with a delay of 1.59 ms. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/de/xk/zm/dexkzmwe9pcr8x40vx-t4ua-lxm.png"><br><br>  All tested drives showed almost identical results in the second test (Random record 4 KB): the speed is slightly higher than 63,000 IOPS with a delay of 2 ms. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jl/qt/hl/jlqthlhowax-8ivrull7gf8aoxi.png"><br><br>  Turning to sequential loads, we first looked at 64 KB read operations.  In this case, the Kingston drive maintained a delay within a millisecond until reaching a speed of 5200 IOPS (325 MB / s).  The maximum rate of 7183 IOPS (449 MB / s) with a delay of 2.22 ms brought this disc to the second place in the overall standings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/m6/p2/su/m6p2suuq4z1-vic1oaztwvecdz0.png"><br><br>  When testing sequential write operations, the Kingston device overtook all competitors, keeping the delay below 1 ms up to a speed of 5700 IOPS (356 MB / s).  The maximum speed was 6291 IOPS (395 MB / s) with a delay of 2.51 ms. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tv/s9/ps/tvs9psurbflmoaglnrxr5peys5q.png"><br><br>  After that, we moved to SQL tasks, where the Kingston DC500R drive was the only device whose latency went beyond the millisecond range in all three tests.  In the first case, the disk showed a maximum speed of 26411 IOPS with a delay of 1.2 ms. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yq/tu/bu/yqtubulk-c4_32fgb7qei78ymu8.png"><br><br>  In the SQL 90-10 test, Kingston took the last place with a maximum speed of 27339 IOPS with a delay of 1.17 ms. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/m2/zu/se/m2zuser9fb47qzuccu1fwyfob-o.png"><br><br>  The same thing happened in the SQL 80-20 test.  The Kingston device in this case showed a maximum speed of 29576 IOPS with a delay of 1.08 ms. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sm/pe/ck/smpeckphojgrgnmzdkizc7kgi1m.png"><br><br>  The results of testing Oracle workloads again put the DC500R in last place, but in two tests the device still showed a delay within milliseconds.  In the first case, Kingston's maximum disk speed was 29,098 IOPS with a delay of 1.18 ms. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1t/kz/_s/1tkz_s4bjiuiwt0srhx9rb6cup8.png"><br><br>  In the second test (Oracle 90-10), the DC500R achieved 24555 IOPS values ‚Äã‚Äãwith a delay of 894.3 ¬µs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hj/i_/jv/hji_jvadibswkvf3rj_s64e3og0.png"><br><br>  In the third test (Oracle 80-20), the maximum speed of the device from Kingston was 26401 IOPS with a delay level of 831.9 Œºs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/u4/fb/r_/u4fbr_fxwskt3pbnvmw0knhbmto.png"><br><br>  Then we moved on to copying VDI ‚Äî creating full and linked copies.  In testing the download of a full-featured VDI copy, Kingston was once again unable to beat the competition.  A delay below 1 ms was supported by the device up to a speed of about 12000 IOPS, and the maximum speed was 16203 IOPS with a delay of 2.14 ms. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fy/ao/p5/fyaop55rbafm7inhnct6hdd7lnw.png"><br><br>  When testing Initial Login copy of the VDI, the Kingston device performed better, taking in the end (with a slight margin) second place.  The drive maintained within a millisecond delay up to a speed of 11000 IOPS, and the maximum speed was 13652 IOPS with a delay of 2.18 ms. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_8/d8/x-/_8d8x-d6ro38pocm_d3-4avyoaq.png"><br><br>  Also with a slight margin Kingston ranked second in the test results Monday Login for a full copy of VDI.  The Seagate Nytro 1351 drive showed a slightly higher maximum speed, but the Kingston unit as a whole showed lower delay levels during the entire test.  The maximum speed of the DC500R was 11897 IOPS with a delay of 1.31 ms. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/94/g9/oc/94g9ocrbyh0t9g7fuvthwf1xrsk.png"><br><br>  In testing the download of related copies of a VDI device, Kingston was in last place.  The delay went beyond 1 ms already at speeds less than 6000 IOPS.  The maximum speed of the DC500R was 7861 IOPS with a delay of 2.03 ms. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/g3/rp/fq/g3rpfqmbktzagrzzwxltdlmm_8k.png"><br><br>  However, according to the results of the Initial Login test, the drive again took second place: beyond the millisecond limits, the delay went out only after reaching peak performance, which eventually amounted to 7950 IOPS with a delay of 1.001 ms. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/su/qk/vm/suqkvm3uodoydyjox24zhtittzm.png"><br><br>  In the last test of the associated VDI copy - Monday Login - the disk also showed the second result: the maximum speed is 9205 IOPS with a delay of 1.72 ms.  Beyond the millisecond, the delay went beyond the speed of 6400 IOPS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xg/8z/rs/xg8zrsiigizonrew96kp6w8dmue.png"><br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  The DC500R is Kingston‚Äôs newest solid-state drive designed for corporate users.  The DC500R is available in a 2.5-inch form factor.  Capacity options are available from 480 GB to 3.84 TB.  The drive is based on 3D TLC NAND flash memory technology and combines a great resource and high level of performance.  For a disk with a capacity of 3.48 TB, sequential read and write speeds of 555 and 520 MB / s, respectively, read and write speeds with constant loads of 98,000 and 28,000 IOPS, respectively, as well as resource size at 3504 TBW, are announced. <br><br>  To evaluate the performance of the Kingston DC500R, we compared it with other popular SATA solid-state drives, including Samsung <a href="https://www.storagereview.com/samsung_860dct_ssd_review">860 DCT</a> and <a href="https://www.storagereview.com/samsung_883_dct_sata_ssd_review">883 DCT</a> drives, as well as the <a href="https://www.storagereview.com/seagate_nytro_3530_ssd_review">Seagate Nytro 3530</a> drive.  Kington DC500R was able to keep at the level of competitors, and in some cases - even surpass them.  When testing application workloads, the Kingston DC500R showed itself well in processing SQL tasks, taking the second overall place in the number of transactions per second (6291.8 TPS) and latency (26.5 ms).  In Sysbench testing with more intensive workloads, the DC500R was at the end of the list with a performance of 1680.5 TPS with an average delay of 76.2 ms and a delay in the least favorable scenario of 134.9 ms. <br><br>  As part of testing random read and write 4 KB blocks, the Kingston DC500R demonstrated a speed of 80209 IOPS and a delay of 1.59 ms when reading, as well as a speed of 63000 IOPS and a delay of 2 ms when writing.  As part of testing the read and write blocks of 64 KB each, the DC500R reached speeds of 7183 IOPS (449 MB / s) with a delay of 2.22 ms and 6291 IOPS (395 MB / s) with a delay of 2.51 ms, respectively.  In terms of synthetic tests using SQL and Oracle databases and increased write speed requirements, the performance of the DC500R left much to be desired.  With regard to SQL workloads, the Kingston DC500R ranked last in all three tests and turned out to be the only storage device whose latency went beyond the millisecond.  However, in Oracle testing the picture turned out to be much better.  In two tests out of three, the drive maintained a delay of less than 1 ms, due to which it took second place.  Kingston DC500R showed a decent level of performance when tested using copies of VDI - both full and related. <br><br>  In general, the <a href="http://kingston.gg/HabrDC500">Kingston DC500R solid-state drive</a> is a high-quality device in its class that deserves closer attention.  No matter how much we like high-performance technologies (NVMe and analogs), it is SATA drives that remain the most preferred solution for processing tasks where reliability plays a crucial role, for example, server load or storage controller.  Such drives are also an economical solution for storing server data in situations where value for money is important.  In addition, they offer all the benefits in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãtotal cost of ownership, which emit solid-state drives on the background of hard drives (HDD).  Indicators DC500R allow the device to occupy the top lines on the basis of a set of tests conducted by us in comparison with other disks worthy of consideration.  DC500R is an excellent drive with SATA interface for scenarios that require reliable and productive disks with a large amount of resources and a wide choice of capacities. <br><br>  DC500 series models are available from Kingston's authorized distributors. <br>  For questions about testing and validation, you can contact the representative office of Kingston Technology in Russia at e-mail address ru_validation@kingston.com <br><br>  For more information about <a href="https://www.kingston.com/">Kingston Technology</a> products, visit the company's website. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/452792/">https://habr.com/ru/post/452792/</a></p>
