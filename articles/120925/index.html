  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The development of Funnybeanbag. May 2011</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><br>  Having been in the clutches of Habra and leprosy, I felt an irresistible desire to remain visible in the future.  And what most makes a small project noticeable?  Only image advertising, noise marketing in blogs and social networks, constant soaring in the necessary and readable places ... I will not mention retail sales in this article, here we will only discuss the promotion of the online store <a href="http://www.funnybeanbag.ru/">http://www.funnybeanbag.ru</a> <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So, you need to constantly be noticed, be a leader, be the best, be everywhere and still and do not forget about independence - you have a project that grows and develops as a Business not from the number of visitors to the site, but from that image and decent service. which you offer.  But where does it take so much time to stay afloat and still have time to earn something. <br><br>  Immediately after the publication on Habr√©, even considering that the section was closed (but most likely the information just scattered around the Internet), I received several offers to supply fannie bags to other cities and establish partnerships and dealer links.  Honestly, I was not ready for the required scale and the only thing I did was send a list of discounts that I could offer and working conditions.  <strong>The main condition was the sale of the branded product with the label and stripe Funnybeanbag</strong> .  That is, the gross sell of dealers' wallets due to the resale of ordinary covers I was not interested in even considering.  If you enter the regional market, then only as a brand with the provision of discounts to regular dealers, which is the guarantor of brand promotion in those very regions.

      In addition, the shipment to the regions of such bulky items is a rather inconvenient part of such dealership, and almost all potential sellers immediately asked for the prices of the seats of bags without filler.  Again, the question is not easy.  What if the official Apple dealer will bring in Russia not a boxed iMac, but only parts, and some office will already be here, with us, to assemble a full-fledged computer ... In general, the question of sending defective fannies of bags remained open, since I have no idea what they will be fill my product and who will be responsible for it.  I confused the full program of this issue, because everyone works like that!  Well, what is it that some company will acquire 500 covers from us and sell it in its retail network, filling it with its own funds, because all the problems with expanded-polystyrene foam smelling of kerosene or even worse - used foam plastic will fall on that seller‚Äôs shoulders !  The problem was one - to prevent the development of such a "service" in your company.  Therefore, I clearly decided to look for not just dealers, but partners!  People who, in addition to profit, earn a status and image of a reliable, competent company. <br><br>  And from that moment on, the question of sending incomplete fannies of bags was simply closed once and for all.  A company that wants to sell chairs with Funnybeanbag bags, but saves on transportation costs, is unlikely to be looking for quality certified fillers for products.  There are three ways: either you strive to keep the level and face of the company at the same level, you beat the careless dealer for the bases and break off relations with him, or you work exclusively on franchising terms (but selling franchises is also a special art, and I still do not climb ), or send ready-to-sale products without any "and we will buy the filler ourselves."  In general, the number of people willing to sell fannies was reduced to zero.  And for some reason I don‚Äôt feel offended at all)) Probably, because now I‚Äôm not ready to jump into relations with representatives and dealers, simply because I don‚Äôt have the strength to control all this alone. <br><br><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5"><tbody><tr><td width="150">  <b>May 23, 2011</b> <b><br> <a href="http://www.vo3dux.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/057/892/268/0578922688fee99e11079e88871027b3.png"></a></b> </td><td>  Funnybeanbag received an offer to become a <strong>partner of the Air Club in the Armagh complex at Kurskaya</strong> .  Of course, partnerships and sponsorships are big expenses, but a 2x4 meter advertising banner, painted at the entrance, an opportunity for my clients to come and watch fanny bags, external public relations, entrance to any private parties and live in constant drive at any time. what an incomparable thrill!  I agreed almost without thinking. </td></tr></tbody></table> <br><br>  <em>Damn, why I registered a blog, if I write to it occasionally huge press releases that no one really reads.</em>  <em>From that day I decided to record everything that happens with fannies.</em>  <em>And on the basis of this make those same stories.</em>  <em>But since the information is still closed for public daily viewing, I will record everything by date in one post, but in real time.</em> <br><br><br>  <strong>May 24, 2011</strong> <br><br>  In the evening, it was somehow uncomfortably hot due to daytime saturation, so I, as a true freelancer, decided to spend a couple of hours on free-lance.ru blogs.  I wrote some completely stupid post in an unusual manner (apparently, the previous days of writing a heap of press releases for publishing on a heap of sites with press releases had an effect).  By the way, a very good topic is writing news, articles about current promotions and updates and publishing on websites, especially those that are automatically translated to Yandex.News.  There are paid services of this kind, but there are so many free services that I haven‚Äôt even gotten to paid services. <br><br>  The same post, inspired by the break in supplier relations: <br><br>  <em>There are no perfect Internet services, there are no perfect retail stores, shops, companies and studios, and only for one banal reason:</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em>the brick wall that the company has been building over the years, creating a reputation for itself, trembling with respect to each client, cannot constantly be completed and supported by the strong supports that kept it in the process of construction.</em>  <em>This whole strengthened construction can fall apart in a second because of a stupid manager, a driver or courier who has confused areas and did not deliver the goods, because of a secretary who did not have time to answer the phone, due to an error in billing for some idiotic blot in the diary, because of the systematic "tomorrow" and the failure of the promised dates.</em>  <em>And now, instead of a rebuilt "house", there remains a ditch of negative reviews and simply earning a dough ... which you are tired of, as your business is falling apart and you do not even understand why.</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em>In general, how hard it all is e-mine ... Above, I gave an example of a previously successful printing house, which has already closed due to the fact that it has lost trust and customers.</em>  <em>Because any business keeps on constancy: both in clients, and in work, and in relations.</em>  <em>When it is not - random customers only add feed, but not profit.</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em>Where to find a cool manager who would not sit on a chair waiting for the end of the working day, but was the one who wants to grow a business TOGETHER.</em>  <em>Are there any such?</em>  <em>Or is it easier to conclude an agreement with partners ...</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em>As for me, for four months I endured the ‚Äúwork‚Äù of one textile supplying company.</em>  <em>According to brief statistics: out of 10 orders, 7 were brought in incorrectly executed, with a short transport or incorrect numbers in the accounts, with a delay of 3-4-5-6 or (the longest period) of 13 days !!!</em>  <em>That's what I understand - "tomorrow"!</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em>All calls were answered by a friendly voice with almost the same phrase "Olga, sorry, I hope this will not happen again."</em>  <em>And I let down clients who were waiting for ‚Äútomorrow‚Äù, but it turned out as always, I gave up everything and went to this damn Odintsovo for ten meters of cloth, which is hard to lift, not to drag anything!</em>  <em>A week ago, I broke the contract with this supplier of luxury fabrics and found another.</em>  <em>It's a shame, the fabrics they have are really gorgeous, but the service is shit.</em>  <em>And I am sure that this company has no future, because it absolutely doesn‚Äôt care about who, when and how it delivers its elite product and considers itself a Nambur One only because it sells them ... But it‚Äôs not like that.</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em>I also fired my driver, who twice prodinamil me in time.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>In general, I'm just kind of malicious to optional.</em>  <em>Okay.</em>  <em>Smile))</em> <br><br>  And as usual, with someone started a dialogue.  A girl from Volgograd, working in a company producing curtains, answered my message.  She kindly burned me three modest companies in Moscow that sell awesome fabric at fabulous prices.  Evening blogging was not in vain.  The girl is very wonderful, her name is Olga) Later she offered to show my products to the director and, perhaps, to agree on something. <br><br>  Tomorrow I'm going out of town to the site of the program <strong>"Summer Response"</strong> <br><br>  <u><em>Thoughts: I decided to publish such essays once a month in the Habr√© in the ‚ÄúMy Business‚Äù section and I think to organize a newsletter on sabskrayba or maybe I‚Äôll try it ... I don‚Äôt know yet</em></u> <br><br><br>  <strong>May 25, 2011</strong> <br><h4>  Moscow is such Moscow ... </h4><br>  Six hours in traffic, exhausted.  Everything went well, the fanny bags were delivered to Minsk highway.  On the way back, when I was already falling asleep in the car, a phone call came from the <strong>Video International</strong> company with the suggestion of filming fannies in some TV show, apologized and asked to call back tomorrow.  Sleep. <br><br> <a href="http://pics.livejournal.com/funnybeanbag/pic/0001qspc/"><img alt="traffic jams" width="640" height="428" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0c6/ab5/5ab/0c6ab55ab4a573fb6af59c1fedd1ffa5.jpg"></a> <br><br> <strong><br></strong>  <strong>May 30, 2011</strong> <br><h4>  Tired </h4><br>  Agency "Video International" offered to participate in the Ren-tv program for 78,000 rubles in a 10-second video with a minimum budget of 1.5 million rubles.  Well, you understand that I think about it and all that ... <br><br>  Completed the "Relaxation" in the social network Lovastochka, almost all the winners call back and wait for gifts, but gifts will be only after June 8, now I‚Äôm just like a tired broom. <br><br>  On June 12, on NTV in ‚ÄúDachny answer‚Äù there will be fannies, I‚Äôm really waiting for the air at 12-00, I‚Äôll get up early)) After the broadcast, a video and photos will be available, which I will post on the website. <br><br>  Since June 4, Funnybeanbag is the official partner of the Air Club <a href="http://vo3dux.ru/">http://vo3dux.ru/</a> <a href="http://vo3dux.ru/"><br></a> <br>  Once in a while, the fannies came after twelve and one o'clock, from that day the work schedule was changed, now we work not until 22, but until 00 o'clock. <br><br>  With the Rio shopping center Reutov, with whom I agreed to rent a month ago, I broke off powerfully, because in addition to renting, as it turned out, you also need to deposit the amount of the entrance ticket - about $ 10,000.  I decided to go the other way and look for retail dealers - such monsters in furniture centers that will sell my products, and I will not pay a penny either for rent, or for gas, or for light ... <br><br><br>  <strong>June 5, 2011</strong> <br><br>  The day before yesterday I went to a meeting with the director of the "Sofas and Chairs" retail chain, of course they have an impressive warehouse, but the demands to do everything in huge quantities and only from those fabrics that they choose have crossed out their violent desire to work with them.  The answer ‚ÄúOur network is a budget retail network of furniture, do not compare it with sales through an online store‚Äù is a phenomenon in general.  In general, we must think about everything again. <br><br>  <strong>At night, the first ottomans left for the Air club.</strong> <br>  While I was sleeping, they were probably already hanging out there at the first summer after party.  I'll have to go see though.  And the banner should be ordered as soon as possible.  I do not have time. <br><br><img alt="ottoman chairs bags in the club air bin begi" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/487/621/b6b/487621b6b48cd200a1e5a82707b14f19.jpg"><br><br>  The following report in late June-early July <br><br><br><br>  <em>I don't want to do anything to get paid.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>I want to be paid for doing something.</em> <br><br>  Funnybeanbag creator, graphic designer Olga Ilf <br><br>  The post is published on the website in the public domain <a href="http://www.funnybeanbag.ru/news/47/razvitie_funnybeanbag_may_2011/">http://www.funnybeanbag.ru/news/47/razvitie_funnybeanbag_may_2011/</a> <br>  Wellcome! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/120925/">https://habr.com/ru/post/120925/</a></p>
