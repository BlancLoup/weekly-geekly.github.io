Now this question concerns not only them, but also whole states.  With the development of information technology, it became clear that a well-organized cyber attack could cause great harm to the country.  That is why cybersecurity issues are dealt with in many countries, including Russia. <br><br>  The other day, an extended Security Council meeting on information security was held in the Kremlin.  At the very beginning of the meeting, Vladimir Putin noted that the level of threats in the information space is constantly increasing.  He also said that the number of risks is increasing, and the negative consequences of cyber attacks are not local, but, on the contrary, global and large-scale, Kommersant <a href="https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/3450172">writes</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ‚ÄúAs a result of the spread of the WannaCry virus, information resources in 150 countries around the world, including Russia, suffered in May and June.  External invasion of electronic systems in the sphere of defense and public administration, leakage of electronic documents can turn into the most serious consequences, ‚Äùsaid Vladimir Putin.

      The president noted that many countries have long used cyber-war in the public interest.  ‚ÄúA number of countries have actually put information technology into military service: they form their cyber war, use the information field to weaken competitors, advance their economic and political interests, and solve geopolitical tasks.  We must clearly predict potential threats and risks.  And the main thing is to outline additional measures that will allow us not only to identify threats in a timely manner, but to actively respond to them, ‚Äùsaid the head of state. <br><br>  In order to be able to confront cyber threats, it is proposed to focus on such areas as improving the detection system, preventing and eliminating the effects of computer attacks on information resources, improving the security of information systems and communication networks of government agencies, reducing the risks associated with the objective need to use foreign programs and telecommunications equipment, facilitating the creation of an international information security system and  Improving the security and stability of the infrastructure of the Russian segment of the network. <br><br>  According to the president, in this case we are talking not about ‚Äúrestricting access of law-abiding citizens to the resources of the global network, about some total barriers and filters‚Äù, but about fighting those who ‚Äúuse the information space to propagandize radical ideas, justify terrorism, extremism.  Vladimir Putin believes that it is necessary to prevent attempts to post materials that threaten the security of the state and society. <br><br>  It should be noted that at the meeting such issues as cryptocurrency and their regulation were not discussed.  On the other hand, the need for a gradual transition of the defense and civilian sector to the manufacture of its own communications equipment and software was discussed.  In particular, by 2022 Russia <a href="https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/3434515">plans to create a</a> national operating system for Internet of Things devices.  The domestic OS, according to the plan, should exceed foreign analogues in several parameters at once, including speed, security, fault tolerance.  The cost of such a project can range from several hundred million to 1.5 billion rubles. <br><br>  This OS should be used "in all types of cyber-physical systems, surpassing foreign OS in key parameters of speed, security and resiliency."  Responsible for the creation of this software platform will be the Ministry of Industry, Ministry of Communications and Mass Communications, as well as domestic software developers.  According to the Director of the Internet of Things Association, Andrei Kolesnikov, the domestic operating system is needed in order to ensure the safety of automated production process control systems, its creation, among other things, will help save money in the country. <br><br>  In the fourth quarter of 2019, it is planned to adopt national standards for inter-machine interaction for cyber-physical systems. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/357438/">https://habr.com/ru/post/357438/</a></p>
