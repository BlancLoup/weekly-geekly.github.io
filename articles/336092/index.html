So I will catch up. <br><br>  Xored is the best place to work, with its unique culture, unique growth approach and an open salary grid.  Interesting tasks, excellent cohesive team, flexible schedule, the possibility of partial work, and many, many things.  In recent years, the company has grown to 110 people.  With all this, she retained good salaries, interesting projects, and team spirit. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Xored was the best place to work until the end of April 2017. <br><br>  I want to shed some light on a respected (in narrow circles) person who is not guilty that he has got developers at the Prague office.

    <h2>  Let's start in order </h2><br>  As I wrote above, all the problems began in April-May when Comrade.  Andrei P. (‚Äúneh ** evvy engineer‚Äù, but according to the situation in the company it is clear that the extremely x ** new manager, about the engineer is not proven), returned from the Cote d'Azur and fired the CEO lost Xored). <br><br>  Collected all HQ office (in the company 4 offices).  And he said, I quote: "The company ugondoshena."  Ugondoshena she was supposedly a bunch of "extra", unpaid customers of people who funded the company itself.  And by people who, ostensibly, are overvalued, as in prof.  financially so.  Yes, and a bunch of accumulated savings somewhere suddenly gone.  Who is guilty?  CEO.  Dismiss the CEO and all the extras.  Naturally without cuts. <br>  How to reduce the staff from 110 to 80? <br><br><h2>  Black mirror </h2><br>  Within the framework of this meeting, Platov shared the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe so-called black mirror system - similar to the system from the series of the same name.  In it, engineers will evaluate each other.  Will this happen?  - By comparing your colleagues with each other - who is cooler, and who would you take to the team.  The worst developers will be fired. <br><br>  Understandably, many people did not like this idea, since it is meaningless and that is why: <br><br><ol><li>  The office employs 110 people, you do not overlap with everyone, even at the household level.  What is already talking about the technical; </li><li>  The system did not take into account that the choice will come from sympathy and personal affections.  It is unlikely that someone will vote not for his team-mate or acquaintance with whom he is thumping in the bar. </li><li>  Attempts to go against the system were punished.  Suppose you don‚Äôt like the management style of a timlid or something like that.  You do not choose it in the next comparison with another employee, and most of your colleagues think differently.  You lose the level of trust, and your voices are slowly losing weight; </li><li>  How to be people with good engineering skills, but with poor communication (introverts)? </li></ol><br>  Those who debated and criticized the black mirror were dismissed, morally humiliated (they took away the team, publicly insulted that they did not understand anything) or began to actively dig and make up various claims for them.  Although Platov himself called for openly discussing everything, but in fact everything ended as it ended. <br><br>  Offered a variety of ways to solve the current situation with "extra" people: <br><br><ul><li>  Assemble the team leaders and try to decide who can be cut; </li><li>  Reduce everyone a little salary, explaining to everyone the situation.  With this money, pay sn "extra" employees, and much more. </li></ul><br>  But all this was rejected, apparently, the dream of a black mirror captured the mind of the founder. <br><br>  Tension and nervousness in the company grew, all were demoralized.  And at the moment, nothing has changed, everything is also on pins and needles. <br><br>  But the most interesting thing is that after half a month, without even reducing 30 people (we all remember that 80 employees and attendants do not pay at the office), the company began to search hard and hire new people who are ready to work for less money.  It turned out that unpaid people are much less than 30, and as such there is no problem at all. <br><br>  Let's return to the word ‚Äúugondoshena‚Äù - apparently, it was Andrei P.'s fantasy, since he did not explain anything intelligible about this. <br><br>  Further, more - Andrei P. came up with the idea, ‚Äúand not if I also need to lower the RFP for the employees and reduce the number of posts‚Äù.  In order to get rid of the mercantile. <br><br>  And this was done with the statement that in Xored large RFP, and this is supposedly bad.  Scorched, as he called the "passengers" who need only money.  And in order to exclude such obviously bad cells of the company, it is necessary for everyone to lower the RFP.  The testers got the most, the RFP was lowered by 2 times, after which they left - apparently, they were ‚Äúpassengers‚Äù, and did not agree to support work for the idea.  Here are weird. <br><br><h2>  Retreat about ZP </h2><br>  The RFP was, indeed, above the market, now it is not.  As throughout the text there is one BUT.  We have to work a lot, really a lot.  (8-hour working day, no one is limited). <br><br>  Work on weekends is paid for the same traffic as on regular days.  But this also suited everyone because of an adequate RFP and friendly team spirit. <br><br><h2>  About dismissal </h2><br>  So, the black mirror worked.  Employees took "honest", corresponding to their skills, position.  ZP have been lowered.  After that, the outflow of "passengers" began, but in fact - competent engineers, which continues today.  Former employees are arranged in JetBrains, Yandex, 2GIS, Google, Microsoft, go abroad or go to other Novosibirsk companies. <br><br>  Very interesting and how people are laid off.  More often, dismissals are related to the fact that Andrei P. did not like one of your statements or you asked the wrong question.  Nobody treats you like an engineer, doesn't even try.  Dismissals do not occur in the Labor Code of the Russian Federation.  There are no cuts, but there are no valid reasons for dismissal.  There were cases when only half of the salary was paid for the non-probation period. <br><br>  I will describe several cases of dismissal and this is not all. <br><br>  The employee wrote a comment about the reduction of the RFP, which Xored was always famous for its salaries.  Half an hour later, he lost access to corporate mail and the messenger.  Next, VPN and WiFi are cut down.  The employee goes to the system administrator, and he tells him that he was fired.  Why?  - Think for yourself. <br><br>  The next case.  The employee got sick, decided to take time off.  After which he was fired backdating.  He took time off because of a low official RFP (by the way, now they have raised it). <br><br>  A little about the statements of Andrei P. about former employees who work in Google.  With most of them, the company broke up far from on a good note.  And this is also an indicator. <br><br>  Each office has its shortcomings - but when everything is really based on trust, you can work.  In Xored - now there is no trust.  Every day you expect a surprise.  And you don‚Äôt pay attention to your reputation when employees are satisfied, but how many of them, satisfied with their work at Xored, are a mystery. <br><br>  Justice, about which spoke Andrew P. - it is not.  His office, he created it.  He drags her to the bottom. <br><br>  This article would not have happened if there had been an adequate response of Andrei P. to the post of Adamovsky.  Now you have another picture about Xored, think for yourself who is right and who is not in the story of Adamovsky. <br><br>  PS: Oh yes, I wonder how 1C relates to all of this?  51% Xored belongs to her. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/336092/">https://habr.com/ru/post/336092/</a></p>
