  <section class="page js-page"><h1>HP Competition - Sieve Miracles</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Not really resent, just some unpleasant aftermath of a story related to HP.  Indirectly or directly - you decide. <br><br>  From September 20 to October 9, HP held a contest called Dream Workplace in Habr√©.  The conditions he had were quite simple - all he had to do was just to tell what the vital need is in the workplace of an IT specialist and to thoroughly promote his idea among friends and on social networks.  The winner was chosen based on the rating - the simple sum of all likes and retweets. <br><br>  The prizes were promised for the 20 best ideas, including the most delicious ones - a good Probook 4720s laptop and a monitor.

      I, not really participating in any contests, was going to take first place and pick up a laptop.  Well, I do not trust contests, but here the authority and Habra, and HP outweighed.  Actually, the first point of the plan was a success - the necessary number of likes was collected quickly enough.  But with the implementation of the second difficulties. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Free cheese, of course, only happens in a mousetrap, but I don‚Äôt have any reason not to trust the HP brand, so I could only wait for the results and select the winners. <br><br>  Some time later, I received a letter from an advertising agency conducting a campaign that I won a prize ‚Äî an expected laptop.  It remained only to send some personal data for confirmation, in general, everything is in accordance with the rules.  A representative of the organizer also confirmed that the prize is really a Probook 4720s laptop (specifically specified the model) waiting for me, and it‚Äôs time to take it. <br><br>  As long as the cherished gift is not in the hands, in our country it is better not to believe anything.  And in some cases, and after.  That, in fact, was confirmed. <br><br>  So, the time of arrival at the agency‚Äôs office was already agreed upon when I received a letter that it was no longer necessary to hurry - there were ‚Äúpaper‚Äù problems that would take some time.  Needless to say, I need to coordinate any absence in the workplace with the management, and how it is sometimes ‚Äúconvenient‚Äù.  Well, agreed on the next day, in which I took the gift.  But, to my surprise, this was no longer the promised good Probook, but the weak HP PAVILION g6-1160er.  Surprise, I must admit it was not only me, but also the young man who handed it to me.  After the standard procedure of photographing and signing papers, I went home. <br><br>  At home, in a relaxed atmosphere, I began to check the contents of the box with the laptop.  Not only did this notebook have an extremely poor package, but there wasn‚Äôt even a <i>warranty card</i> inside.  What I wrote to the organizers again.  Warranty card, by the way, they are still looking for. <br><br>  As a result, this action has a double impression.  On the one hand, we managed to win a good prize, despite the fact that in reality it turned out to be worse and a little spoiled.  On the other hand, the ongoing campaign had to thoroughly promote the HP Care Pack service pack.  It‚Äôs not for me to judge whether it was possible to do this by collecting the dubious quality of retweets.  And if they succeeded, whether such an advertising campaign is justified for the customer. <br><br>  Just in case, I will duplicate the <a href="">screen with the rules</a> . <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> Now there <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/special/hpcarepacks/">is a list of winners</a> with prizes on the contest page.  Prizes without titles :) <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/i_am_angry/131865/">Continuation of the</a> story </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/131426/">https://habr.com/ru/post/131426/</a></p>
