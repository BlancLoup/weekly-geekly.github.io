      <b>Linear conveyor.</b>  <b>The path from point A to point B.</b> <br>  From early childhood, our world is orderly, all the examples that life gives us, parents, school, are especially linear.  Exceptions are rare, are perceived as something out of the rules.  Remember, school tasks about the path from point A to point B, in which there were also intermediate points.  This is the key algorithm of all actions that are taught in a regular, average school.  We know from childhood that in order to achieve a result, this and that should be done.  There is nothing bad in it, because the linearity of actions is simple, understandable, predictable.  But there is a small problem, not always linear actions and behavior are most effective in real life. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  When it comes to building a house, we will never start building from the roof.  First, we will lay the foundation, then we will build the walls, and only then we will deal with the roof.  The logical and correct approach.  Outside the physical world, non-linear actions are much more efficient and applicable to a variety of tasks.  For example, we use a non-linear action when referring to an encyclopedia or a dictionary of foreign words.  Instead of studying a particular discipline, in order to learn one meaning of a word or term, we ‚Äúpeep‚Äù it in a specialized book, snatch it from context.  This helps save time, speeds us up, but does not make us a specialist in the field to which we turned.  Yes, we do not need to be specialists in it, we are interested in a specific term or article on a phenomenon. <br><br>  The trip to work is a linear process.  We cannot change its course.  We need to wake up, have breakfast, get dressed, go to work from point A to point B. Unfortunately, we are instantly transferred to our office, we do not know how.  For events from the world of material, physical, the linearity of processes is characteristic and this is their property.  For those involved in intellectual work, non-linearity of processes and their acceleration are possible. <br><br>  A programmer who starts writing a program can assemble it from separate blocks.  It does not have a task, to implement an authorization form for entering the program from the first steps, this block can be implemented later.  In programming, the nonlinearity of the creation of a product-program is well shown; it can be created from separate bricks, blocks connected in meaning. <br><br>  When writing books, many of the writers avoid linearity, work in parallel on several storylines, write out heroes and events, as information accumulates.  And then assemble the individual parts into one.  This method even allowed painless participation in the creation of books by several authors.  Each takes on a separate storyline, and then together come up with bundles between them.  Is the work accelerating?  Much. <br><br>  The examples are obvious, they lie on the surface.  The first thing we need to learn is to single out linear and non-linear problems in life.  This is a sort of sorting, which allows you to understand what work needs to be done consistently and what not. <br><br>  The second major issue is the adequate division of your task into subtasks.  Which are not linked to each other in time.  For example, you need to write a summary of the history of Roman law.  Making a plan of the abstract, you will see that it consists of separate chapters, the work on each of which is almost not related to the others.  There is no linearity at the stage of creating the material, you give completeness to your work, linking together the individual chapters.  While you are writing one of the chapters, it is good to put in other things that have nothing to do with the abstract. <br><br>  Many tasks in our life and work can be divided into separate subtasks and solve them in parallel.  Moreover, at a single point in time, it is more efficient to engage in not one task or a subtask of one case, but several different tasks.  Departing from the linearity of doing things, you get a huge advantage. <br><br>  Let's try to explain it with examples.  You need to view the news on TV, write a few letters to your partners, prepare papers.  What are you doing?  You turn on the TV and do these things.  That is, your attention is focused on several cases, and you miss information that is not important for yourself on TV, putting the papers aside when you hear something interesting for you.  A typical situation of parallel execution of several tasks.  So did most of us. <br><br>  Let's try to complicate the task.  During the day you need to make a dozen calls, write letters, view documents, do some other things.  Many approach this task linearly, namely, they begin to look through the mail and respond to emails, then move on to calls and other activities.  In most situations, it is an inefficient waste of your time. <br><br>  If you are viewing the mail and reading it, you must immediately respond to emails.  For 90 percent of mail, this is the most effective way, otherwise such letters may remain completely unanswered, as you put them off until later.  The answer to the letter must occur between other cases.  This is not a linear problem, since each individual letter is usually not related to others in meaning.  You can consider work with mail a task that can be divided into separate segments (read letters).  We received a letter, looked at it, answered.  There are no frightening numbers in front of the mailbox, by the end of the working day, all letters are parsed.  Leaving "important" letters for later means not answering them.  Set a goal to answer all emails throughout the day.  It is possible that for typical situations, templates will suit you, sometimes they help a lot. <br><br>  What about calls?  Exactly the same story.  There is no rule that you need to call your list from 10 am to solve your affairs.  You can vary the time of calls during the day, and between calls to occupy yourself with other activities. <br><br>  From school biology course, we know that mental and physical activity must be alternated.  This simple rule is forgotten by most office workers and not only by them.  Creating a to-do list, setting priorities, dividing each case into subtasks, it is important to understand the sequence in which to do them, so that mental activity alternates with trips to meetings, lunch, and other physical activities. <br><br>  Your task is not just to do business, but to do it effectively and with a minimum of effort.  At the same time, efficiency does not always mean linear execution of a case.  For example, calling everyone in an hour, you will do this business.  But calls during the day will take the same amount of time, but will allow to alternate different activities (writing, speaking) to avoid fatigue.  Try to think about this aspect of the alternation of their tasks, subtasks. <br><br>  I try not to create my own days when I have a meeting after a meeting in the city.  Leaving for such meetings in the morning, in the evening you are exhausted like a lemon, as there is no alternation of activity, inside there are twenty cups of coffee, tea, lemonade and strength left just to reach the sofa.  Another thing, if in the morning you have time to read the mail (a little), have breakfast, write something or read a book and then go to a meeting.  The difference of impressions, a pledge that your attention is not dulled.  After lunch, you have to go back to the office and work.  Consider your physiology.  If dinner makes you sleepy, plan things that will cheer you up and keep you in good shape. <br><br>  Take a blank sheet of paper and try to sketch out in detail your typical work day.  List all the small and big things.  Try to break them into subtasks.  See how you can change your day to alternate physical and mental work.  Our world is not always linear and it is important to see where and when we can work on tasks in parallel. <br><br>  Specially did not begin to shower you with various examples of parallel work on different tasks, I limited myself to banal examples known to each of us.  Cause?  I do not want for particulars, you have lost the whole idea of ‚Äã‚Äãnon-linear work on your tasks.  The chip is in this.  But if you have examples of how you accelerate yourself, break up your business into subtasks, thank you for sharing such experiences in the comments.  I think the most interesting examples are to be put up in a separate chapter, and to share them with everyone.  Thank you in advance. <br><br>  <b>Pleasant self-deception</b> <br>  Say my light to the mirror ... This phrase from a fairy tale accurately describes what any ambitious person who is focused on success should do.  The inner attitude, like that of an athlete, is half the work done.  How does your performance change when you are annoyed, look at the world through the shroud of your problems?  I think that it leaves much to be desired, but in your head you have completely different thoughts not related to work.  And here comes the eternal question of how to ensure that your condition does not affect your work. <br><br>  The ideal option is to take you to a Buddhist temple for 7 years so that you will be taught a breathing technique, taught to calm your mind and control emotions, at least superficially.  The path is difficult and unacceptable for most of us.  Let me share a few tricks that help relieve tension and stress in the workplace and regain, if not a positive, but calm state of mind. <br><br>  - Get out and breathe in the fresh air, walk for five minutes; <br>  - No need to drive away bad thoughts from yourself, they still will not go anywhere.  No need to insult offense.  Think rationally about why such a situation has arisen, what can be done to resolve it, and what kind of maneuvers can help with this.  Your task is to transfer the situation from the emotional to the rational plane, to remove the intensity of passions; <br>  - Drink strong and sweet tea, this will allow your head to get glucose, relax a little; <br>  - Do not discuss the current situation with colleagues, do not allow other people to influence your emotions, do not support them in the heat (of course, if you do not want this).  Discuss the situation after a while; such a discussion will be calmer, less emotional; <br>  - You yourself can continue the list of what can be done in such situations in order to return the mental attitude.  Each of us has our own little tricks and stunts.  Want to share with others your experience, welcome, in the comments to the material. <br><br>  Having finished with the negative, let's turn to the positive side of the question.  It is no secret that most of the time, our soul does not sing, the world does not seem beautiful, it is ordinary.  And that's fine.  Yes, and many things that we do to work are ordinary, do not cause us a surge of enthusiasm.  To deal with this is necessary and the best way to give yourself a reward for doing a boring business.  What kind of promotion it can be, it's up to you, no one except you will say that it is the best for you.  For example, for me, after writing a boring, but necessary material, such encouragement is an opportunity to spend half an hour on an online game.  It looks like getting a piece of sugar to an animal in a circus after a successful performance.  This is true.  But it was proven on animals to create a positive feedback connection in the head, and it did not bother anyone.  After a while, you will notice that it will become easier to perform routine work, even without a subsequent ‚Äúreward‚Äù.  This trick allows you to put up with things that otherwise bore and make you yawn.  Yes, and labor productivity increases significantly. <br>  Create in your head positive feedback for most boring things you do all the time.  You can note how much time it took you before you did the trick and after that.  In my case, the difference is almost half.  This time saved can be spent on other things. <br><br>  <b>Motivation plus awareness</b> <br><br>  I want to specifically emphasize that motivation is a big part of the job, a pledge that it will be done.  How to achieve positive motivation, we said above.  But besides motivation you need to imagine how you will carry out your work in practice.  It helps a lot in work.  You just imagine how and what, in what order you will do to achieve your goal.  In sports, such a situation is used to present the desired result.  For example, an athlete can imagine how he runs, repels, jumps.  Or imagine how the ball, fired by his hand, falls into the basket.  The main thing is to lose the situation in my head and present the necessary result.  Thus, you create a positive motivation for yourself; it is easier for you to do the necessary work.  My advice to you, try doing this week, you will see how many things will be easier, and you will win extra time.  Which you can spend on your own. <br><br>  And, as usual, to be continued.  This is not all tricks and tricks.  Thank you for your patience. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/99617/">https://habr.com/ru/post/99617/</a></p>
