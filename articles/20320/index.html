  <section class="page js-page"><h1>We digest News2.ru</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Nobody has to explain the importance of social networks.  To direct visitors to your website / blog, to get a large number of natural links, or to launch a viral advertising campaign - in this you can not do without social networks.  In this particular case, I will consider the social news site - <a href="http://news2.ru/">news2.ru</a> . <br><br>  With an average attendance of 6.5 thousand people a day, a news item or article from the main page can lead to your site several thousand of them.  If you hang the news regularly, this number will increase many times. <br><br>  So how to bring your news to the first page of news2.ru?  If you simply sign up for the service and post your news, your chances will be very slim.  Only top users from the top thirty (hundreds at best) can effectively and effectively advertise themselves.  First you have to sweat, gaining credibility, leaving just interesting news for the community.  How to do it? <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h2>  What news love </h2><br>  <strong>Politics</strong> <br>  It is in great demand.  Political news of Russia, CIS, USA and other international.  Strongly in the top hardly climb, but the news will qualify, and that is what we need.  The most popular are Putin and Medvedev, which is not surprising. <br><br>  <strong>Russian economy</strong> <br>  It is clear that all of us are interested in our welfare.  The increase in public sector wages, the increase in the gold fund, the sharp fall / rise in the ruble exchange rate against the dollar, oil prices and other defaults are very tasty topics. <br><br>  <strong>IT news</strong> <br>  In particular, everything related to social networks (both ours and foreign ones), browsers and search engines.  The records in the field of IT and high technologies ‚Äî the thinnest TV, the smallest mp3 player, etc. ‚Äî are a little worse. <br><br>  <strong>Everything related to news2.ru</strong> <br>  Members of the community are interested in everything related to their favorite site.  ‚ÄúNews2.ru on the first position of Yandex‚Äù, ‚ÄúNews2.ru was unavailable for 2 days‚Äù - 100% will take you to the first page, and for a few days. <br><br>  <strong>Major victories of Russia in sports</strong> <br>  The victory of our football team over the English, the victory of a tennis player at the Grand Slam, gold medals at the Olympics. <br>  Important: only really big victories are interesting, in general, sport is not popular. <br>  Death of famous people <br>  As it is not sad, but everyone is interested to learn about the death of celebrities.  Also vote in order to express solidarity and sympathy. <br><br>  <strong>Injustice in Russian society</strong> <br>  Since the site is social, then injustice in society causes a special response from visitors.  In such topics are usually the most comments. <br><br>  <strong>Fun and other funny occasions</strong> <br>  Here, as lucky, sometimes it can roll, sometimes not. <br><br><h2>  What news do not like </h2><br>  <strong>Murder, crime and other bloodshed</strong> <br>  ‚ÄúThe father cooked four of his children in the microwave‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe student slaughtered her lover with scissors,‚Äù and so on.  People already have enough negative emotions in real life, and even on the TV screen in normal news they flow like water. <br><br>  <strong>Computer games</strong> <br>  Well, just do not like it.  Not that contingent. <br><br>  <strong>Reviews of any one product from many</strong> <br>  New Nokia Phone, BMW Crash Test, Tomb Ryder Game Review.  Such news is too narrow and can attract attention from the strength of several people. <br><br>  Of course, there are exceptions to these rules, but most often such news scores only if they are hung by the top user. <br><br><h2>  Most Popular Donor Sites </h2><br>  A newbie is best to start hanging news from trusted sites that are trusted in the community.  Here is a list of the ten most popular sites: <br><ul><li>  lenta.ru </li><li>  newsru.com </li><li>  habrahabr.ru </li><li>  rian.ru </li><li>  cybersecurity.ru </li><li>  gazeta.ru </li><li>  top.rbc.ru </li><li>  membrana.ru </li><li>  webplanet.ru </li><li>  vz.ru </li></ul><br>  But stop on the most famous sites can not.  Competition is high enough for them, you may just not have time to hang up the news.  One of the most unpleasant things that can happen is to see that someone is ahead of you with a 100% hit in just a few minutes.  Search online for interesting resources and take advantage of the exclusive opportunity to post news from them while they are still little known. <br><br><h2>  RSS is the best friend of the newshaper </h2><br>  You may have a reasonable question - so I need 20 times a day to go through these sites in search of news?  How much time will it take?  Just a few minutes, if you subscribe to the rss-feeds of these sites.  Deliver updates every 5 minutes and you will always be up to date. <br><br><h2>  When is it better to hang the news? </h2><br>  Most of the Internet users live in the western part of Russia, and the most active in Moscow.  So on Moscow and need to focus.  The best time is from 8.00 to 22.00 Moscow time. <br><br>  And why is it so important to hang the news during high user activity?  The fact is that the more time has passed since the appearance of your news, the more difficult it is to get to the first main page. <br><br><h2>  Multiple accounts - is there any point? </h2><br>  Sometimes there is a desire to make 5-6 auxiliary accounts and pump their news with free voices.  The effect of this will be rather negative. <br>  1. If for the most part you and your bots voted for the news, then under it will appear a big red inscription: ‚ÄúThe probability is high that the votes are twisted‚Äù.  After this, the first page you just do not shine. <br>  2. It is quite difficult to pump several profiles at once, and the voices of your ‚Äúcopies‚Äù will have very little weight.  One more or less authoritative user who simply likes your news will bring you much more. <br><br>  The only useful application of bots is to add your comments.  For them, no cheating is not displayed, and other users, seeing a powerful positive reaction to your comment, will also tend to give you a plus.  Thus, you will form the image of a respected commentator.  And if the comments are credible, then the news too. <br><br><h2>  Small tips in bulk </h2><ul><li>  Do not post the news immediately after registration, wait a couple of days, get up to date.  It is rather difficult to immediately determine if the news you want to add is already hanging (searching does not always help).  Nothing good will happen if the first few of your news are buried. </li><li>  Immediately add the top 30 users as a friend.  It is possible that some of them will add you as a friend in response. </li><li>  Add new users to your friends and vote for their news.  The intended effect is similar to the previous one. <br>  Get rid of the inscription "new member" as soon as possible.  Chances news beginner get to the top tend to a minus of infinity.  Hanging out two news stories a day, in 3-4 days you will become like a regular community member. </li><li>  Do not fight with the top users - it will be more expensive.  If one of them buried your news, do not make a "terrible revenge" and do not bury his news in return.  Your voice is unlikely to seriously affect, but you can very badly ruin your life.  Even if your high-quality news regularly buries one or several giants, it is better to go into the shade for a couple of days and not post the news.  It is possible that they will forget about you and leave you alone. </li><li>  Follow the movement of your news from the profile.  There they are gathered together, the number of votes is also noted.  To update one page from time to time is much more convenient than jumping on different pages. </li></ul><br><h2>  Top Users Statistics </h2><br>  Finally, I propose to get acquainted with the statistics of the first 30 (at the time of this writing). <br><br><table border="1" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td>  <strong>No</strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong></td><td>  <strong>news</strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong></td><td>  <strong>Comments</strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong></td><td>  <strong>Efficiency (%)</strong> </td></tr><tr><td>  one </td><td>  1943 </td><td>  3042 </td><td>  43 </td></tr><tr><td>  2 </td><td>  1447 </td><td>  10273 </td><td>  54 </td></tr><tr><td>  3 </td><td>  1644 </td><td>  942 </td><td>  48 </td></tr><tr><td>  four </td><td>  1025 </td><td>  3880 </td><td>  56 </td></tr><tr><td>  five </td><td>  1130 </td><td>  2336 </td><td>  35 </td></tr><tr><td>  6 </td><td>  389 </td><td>  1826 </td><td>  72 </td></tr><tr><td>  7 </td><td>  750 </td><td>  436 </td><td>  71 </td></tr><tr><td>  eight </td><td>  1239 </td><td>  1939 </td><td>  40 </td></tr><tr><td>  9 </td><td>  448 </td><td>  2987 </td><td>  65 </td></tr><tr><td>  ten </td><td>  671 </td><td>  1925 </td><td>  76 </td></tr><tr><td>  eleven </td><td>  465 </td><td>  1355 </td><td>  61 </td></tr><tr><td>  12 </td><td>  581 </td><td>  2551 </td><td>  55 </td></tr><tr><td>  13 </td><td>  637 </td><td>  2474 </td><td>  43 </td></tr><tr><td>  14 </td><td>  971 </td><td>  1818 </td><td>  46 </td></tr><tr><td>  15 </td><td>  677 </td><td>  1167 </td><td>  56 </td></tr><tr><td>  sixteen </td><td>  425 </td><td>  5312 </td><td>  thirty </td></tr><tr><td>  17 </td><td>  914 </td><td>  822 </td><td>  55 </td></tr><tr><td>  18 </td><td>  540 </td><td>  1279 </td><td>  54 </td></tr><tr><td>  nineteen </td><td>  592 </td><td>  296 </td><td>  49 </td></tr><tr><td>  20 </td><td>  794 </td><td>  391 </td><td>  55 </td></tr><tr><td>  21 </td><td>  738 </td><td>  738 </td><td>  61 </td></tr><tr><td>  22 </td><td>  492 </td><td>  789 </td><td>  36 </td></tr><tr><td>  23 </td><td>  311 </td><td>  824 </td><td>  42 </td></tr><tr><td>  24 </td><td>  317 </td><td>  1137 </td><td>  49 </td></tr><tr><td>  25 </td><td>  551 </td><td>  441 </td><td>  55 </td></tr><tr><td>  26 </td><td>  435 </td><td>  500 </td><td>  56 </td></tr><tr><td>  27 </td><td>  199 </td><td>  1142 </td><td>  29 </td></tr><tr><td>  28 </td><td>  503 </td><td>  160 </td><td>  53 </td></tr><tr><td>  29 </td><td>  710 </td><td>  2253 </td><td>  33 </td></tr><tr><td>  thirty </td><td>  368 </td><td>  888 </td><td>  40 </td></tr><tr><td>  The average </td><td>  661 </td><td>  1864 </td><td>  50 </td></tr><tr><td>  min </td><td>  199 </td><td>  160 </td><td>  29 </td></tr><tr><td>  max </td><td>  1943 </td><td>  10273 </td><td>  72 </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  That is, on average, to get to the top 30, you need to post 661 news and leave 1864 comments.  How fast can you post this amount of news and get to the top?  At the moment, the record is for <strong>100 days</strong> . <br><br>  It should also be noted that the effectiveness of news increases in proportion to your rating, so if at first it will be low - do not worry. <br><br>  Related Links: <br>  <a href="http://maulnet.ru/archives/255" title="Maulnet about news2.ru">Maulnet about news2.ru</a> <br>  <a href="http://n2nation.ru/news/doing-news-right-way.html">Learn more about how to make out news for n2.</a> <br><br><br>  via <a href="http://blog.datio.ru/post/10.html">blog.datio.ru</a> <br>  ¬© Snegirev Gleb </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/20320/">https://habr.com/ru/post/20320/</a></p>
