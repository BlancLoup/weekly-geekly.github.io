This is the largest increase in the x86 CPU market share the company has experienced in all the time. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-grad/blog/332394/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/3a5/c59/ce0/3a5c59ce053e4425b2f5f4f16c8f8adf.jpg"></a> <a name="habracut"></a>  <i>/ photo <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/halfrain/16490492092/">halfrain</a> <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">CC</a></i> <br><br>  In the first quarter of 2017, the company was able <a href="http://wccftech.com/amd-takes-10-4-cpu-share-intel-q2-2017-largest-single-quarter-share-gain-history/">to increase</a> its share by only 2.2%.  This is mainly due to the fact that only half of AMD Ryzen products were available on the market.  The launch also "smeared" the lack of AM4 motherboards.  In the second quarter, the company showed itself quite differently: motherboards became more accessible, and also appeared processors of the Ryzen 7 family.

      The share of AMD in the first quarter was 20.6%, and by the end of the second rose to 31%.  In the first quarter of last year, it was equal to 18.1%.  The share of Intel is currently 69%.  In the third quarter, AMD plans to launch an ultra high-end Threadripper line and Ryzen components for mobile platforms, which can be expected to lead to a further increase in the company's performance - now the number of AMD processors users has reached a maximum in the last ten years. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/1f2/1f5/03b/1f21f503bf784356a9484ebd9de0b304.png" width="500"></div>  <i>AMD and Intel market share (according <a href="https://www.cpubenchmark.net/market_share.html">to</a> PassMark)</i> <br><br>  Note that the data for the sample were taken from the base of tested PassMark benchmark processors.  These statistics reflect the number of real systems on which the PassMark performance test was run, not the number sold or supplied by the CPU.  In this case, the statistics takes into account only computers running the Windows operating system, and does not take into account game consoles.  But despite this, the graphics quite accurately demonstrate the balance of power of the two IT giants. <br><br>  Many users are positive <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/6koktx/amd_vs_intel_market_share_current_state/">about the</a> work done by AMD, and believe that the increase in market share is fully justified.  Reddit residents expect further growth of the graph, linking it with the upcoming release of laptops with hybrid processors based on Zen / Vega. <br><br>  AMD's management is also optimistic and looks forward to further positive developments.  Mark Papermaster at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch 2017 conference <a href="https://www.overclockers.ru/hardnews/84883/amd-verit-chto-ee-doli-rynka-vernutsya-k-istoricheskim-maksimumam.html">stated</a> that he sees no reason that would prevent AMD from regaining the historical maximum of the CPU market share.  According to him, universality of use and coverage of different price segments by Ryzen processors will contribute to further growth. <br><br>  In the server processor segment, the company wants to increase its share to double digits in a couple of years.  And <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davealtavilla/2017/06/23/amd-will-take-server-market-share-from-intel-with-epyc/">do</a> this with the help of EPYC processors, officially submitted two weeks earlier.  <a href="https://www.overclockers.ru/hardnews/85145/processory-amd-epyc-predstavleny-oficialno.html">According</a> to AMD's internal tests, the EPYC models are significantly faster than the Intel Xeon Broadwell EP generation models.  Thus, the 32-core model EPYC 7601 when working with integer values ‚Äã‚Äã(SPEC test) proved to be 47% faster than the 22-core Intel Broadwell at 2.4 / 3.6 GHz and 75% faster when working with floating-point numbers .  AMD is confident that the new products will be able to partly confront Skylake Intel Xeon processors, and not just Broadwell. <br><br>  Note that AMD also hopes to regain its historical maximum in the "graphic field."  The Polaris solution has already allowed AMD to win 5% of the market from competitors, and after the release of the Vega card, the company will have a chance to gain a foothold in the upper price range. <br><br>  PS A few more materials from the <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BB%25D1%258E%25D1%2581%25D1%258B-%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2583%25D1%2581%25D1%258B-%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D1%2587%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D1%2585-%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2-%25D0%25B2-%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8-iaas-paas-saas-%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5-%25D1%258D%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2">First Corporate IaaS blog</a> : <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F-%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25B2-vsphere-%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2588%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5-%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D1%2585-%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC-%25D1%2581-cpu">Performance Optimization in vSphere: Solving Major CPU Problems</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F-%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25B2-vsphere-%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2588%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5-%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D1%2585-%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC-%25D1%2581-cpu-%25D1%2587%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%258C-2">Performance Optimization in vSphere: Solving Major CPU Problems (Part 2)</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D1%2583-%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B7%25D1%2583%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582-%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F-%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0-%25D0%25B2-%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2583%25D1%2582%25D0%25B1%25D1%2583%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B5-%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582-%25D0%25B1%25D1%258B%25D1%2582%25D1%258C-%25D0%25BB%25D1%2583%25D1%2587%25D1%2588%25D0%25B5-%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC-%25D1%2583-%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D1%258B%25D1%2588%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE-%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0-%25D0%25B2-%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B5">Why the result of testing the speed of a disk in a laptop can be better than an industrial server in the cloud?</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BB%25D1%258E%25D1%2581%25D1%258B-%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2583%25D1%2581%25D1%258B-%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D1%2587%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D1%2585-%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2-%25D0%25B2-%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8-iaas-paas-saas-%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5-%25D1%258D%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2">Pros and cons of cloud services in IaaS, PaaS, SaaS models: expert opinion</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA-%25D1%2581%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D1%258C%25D1%2581%25D1%258F-%25D1%2581-%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D1%2583%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D1%2589%25D0%25B8-iaas">How to handle peak loads with IaaS</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/332394/">https://habr.com/ru/post/332394/</a></p>
