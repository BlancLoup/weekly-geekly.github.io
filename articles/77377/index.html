    <img src="http://grab.by/ZPM" alt="" title="Google Adsense support"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  You will not find an ideal bureaucrat in the office; he does not sit in a chair and does not smoke expensive cigars.  Most likely he is sitting behind a thick wall in a cold room.  Meet - machine, working on the algorithm, which someone asked years ago.  With this ‚Äúofficial‚Äù you will always have to submit documents and it will only communicate according to predetermined rules.  It is impossible to explain ‚Äúforgotten at home‚Äù, ‚Äúcircumstances‚Äù, ‚ÄúI cannot, because ...‚Äù - the machine does not care about all this.  The machine simply does not know how to worry, it is not programmed. <br><br>  It would seem: what does Google have to do with ... With Google‚Äôs support, I already had to face some time ago.  I <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/google/69547/">already described</a> it on Habr√©.  That problem was solved.  2 months later.  Because it manifested itself in many hundreds (thousands?) Of users.  (reminiscent of the work of the native police: no body - no business).  All these 2 months access to accounts was absent, and writing in support was almost similar to shouting into emptiness, but! .. after all, you knew that your letter, even among many thousands, but you see the eyes of a man!  There is hope! <br><br>  However, since that time, support has progressed ... towards an ideal bureaucrat.  Apparently, the emptiness is tired of listening to the cries of individual people.  The last thread of direct communication in the form of a form that could be sent directly to support by email is cut off.  Now at your service is only a <a href="https://google.com/adsense/support/bin/request.py%3Fdisplay%3Dlogin">javascript bot machine</a> that ‚Äúsolves‚Äù your problems by diligently repeating all the same answers.  And he is not interested in the fact that the inscription that the application will be considered within a week, I have been watching for 4 months already.  The answer is the same: wait a week.  To argue with a piece of HTML-document, of course, is meaningless.  HTML - the Ideal bureaucracy! <br><br>  I do not know what tomorrow will be the new OS, and which browser will capture the market.  One thing is clear: users will constantly have problems.  And most often, these problems are because the developers did something wrong.  And to leave users face to face with the perfect bureaucrat is like dying in the desert: what does not even hate you is killing you, it simply does not know what you are.  Of course, a separate user for the company is nothing.  One snowflake, or not: here are two, three ... <br><br>  (Some may say that there are forums left, but only Google‚Äôs <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582">Crawler</a> reads from Google‚Äôs employees, and this one is exactly in collusion with its fellow support service) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/77377/">https://habr.com/ru/post/77377/</a></p>
