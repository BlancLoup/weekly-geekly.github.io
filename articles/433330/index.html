  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Solving Japanese Crosswords with SAT Solver</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On Habr√© there were several articles on solving Japanese crosswords, where the authors came up with various ways to solve such crosswords.  In the commentary on the article <a href="https://habr.com/post/418069">Solving Japanese Color Crosswords with the Speed ‚Äã‚Äãof Light,</a> I suggested that since the solution of Japanese crosswords is an NP-complete task, then they must be solved using an appropriate tool, namely the SAT solver.  Since my idea was met with very skepticism, I decided to try to implement it and compare the results with other approaches.  What came out of this can be found under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As you know, the Japanese crossword or nomogram is a logic puzzle in which you need to restore the image in a rectangle using the numbers located to the left in the row headers and on top in the column headers.  These numbers correspond to the order and length of the blocks of shaded cells in a row or column, and there must be at least one empty cell between them when blocks are installed.  Here I consider only two-color crosswords, where each cell can be either painted over or not.  In fact, to solve this problem, it is necessary to find the position of each block.  It should be noted that a task may have one or several solutions, as well as no solutions at all.  This solver should also report. <br><br>  It is easy to understand that the problem is generally over the top and the authors of numerous applications try to find the fastest solution algorithm by <s>writing their own bikes of</s> different tricks, rather than using the well-developed methods used in the Boolean satisfiability problem.  However, this statement requires proof, so I decided to reformulate the problem of solving a Japanese crossword puzzle in conjunctive-normal form and use one of the well-known SAT solvers to solve it in order to confirm it or disprove it. <br><br>  To represent this problem in conjunctive-normal form, we introduce one boolean variable for each cell of the field and one variable for each possible position of each block in rows and columns.  For a cell of a field, a boolean variable will mean whether this cell is colored or not, and for a block position, a boolean variable will mean whether this block is present at this position or not.  We write the necessary relations between the variables (clauses):

      1. Each block declared in a row or column must appear at least in one position.  This corresponds to a clause of the form (X1 V X2 V ... XN), where X1, X2 ... XN are all possible positions of a given block in a row or column. <br><br>  2. Each block in a row or column should appear no more than once.  This corresponds to the set of clauses of the form (not Xi) V (not Xj), where Xi, Xj (i! = J) are all possible positions of a given block in a row or column. <br><br>  3. The correct order of blocks.  Since it is necessary to maintain the correct order of blocks, as well as eliminate their intersection, it is necessary to add clauses, of the form (not Xi) V (not Xj), where Xi, Xj are variables corresponding to the positions of different blocks that have the wrong order or intersect. <br><br>  4. The painted cell must be contained inside at least one block, the position of which includes the given cell.  This corresponds to a clause of the form ((not Xk) V X1 V X2 ... XN), where Xk is the variable corresponding to the cell, and X1, X2 ... XN are the variables corresponding to the positions of the blocks containing the given cell. <br><br>  5. Each empty cell must not be contained in any possible position of a single block.  This corresponds to the set of clauses of the form Xi V (not Xj), where Xi is the variable corresponding to the cell, and Xj is the variable corresponding to one position of any block containing the given cell. <br><br>  Thus, the problem is formulated as a conjunctive-normal form and can be solved with the help of the SAT Solver.  Moreover, if there is no solution, the SAT Solver will determine that there is no solution. <br><br>  Now it is the turn to confirm or deny my assumption that the SAT solver will cope with the solution of Japanese crosswords faster than other algorithms.  To test this, I took examples from the <a href="https://webpbn.com/survey">Survey of Paint-by-Number Puzzle Solvers</a> website.  On this site there is a table comparing the speed of various applications for solving Japanese crosswords and a good set of examples - from the lightest, which are solved by everyone, to complex, which only one application solves.  These results were obtained on a computer with a 2.6GHz AMD Phenom II X4 810 quad-core 64-bit processor Memory: 8 Gb.  I used an Intel¬Æ Core (TM) i7-2600K CPU @ 3.40GHz Memory 16 Gb computer. <br><br>  As a result, I got the following results: <br><br><pre><code class="plaintext hljs">========

which is solved only by one application. </li><li>  SAT Solver easily solves many examples that cannot be solved by most applications. </li><li>  The solution time is in most cases better with SAT Solver than with other applications. </li><li>  I used a single-threaded SAT solver; if you use a multi-threaded SAT solver, the results will be even better. </li><li>  When using SAT Solver, there is no need to invent your own algorithms, which someone has invented with a high probability. </li></ol><br>  In conclusion, you can add that the SAT solver can receive more than one solution, if there are any.  To do this, you need to add one clause of the form ((not X1) V (not X2) V ... (not XN)), where X1, X2 ... XN are variables corresponding to the filled cells in the previous solution. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/433330/">https://habr.com/ru/post/433330/</a></p>
