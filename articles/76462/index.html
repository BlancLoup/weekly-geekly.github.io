  <section class="page js-page"><h1>CUD-CUDA, or why it is not necessary to press a video card</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A few months ago, having become disillusioned with the Badaboom utility, I abandoned the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãusing a video card to encode video into the Sony PSP format.  With a relatively small saving of time, neither the size of the file on the output, nor - especially pleased!  - picture quality.  I <b>felt sorry</b> for myself and shook with the help of free <b>XViD4PSP</b> , and I really liked this business.  I have long been self-assembled NAS on the dual-core Intel Atom.  Charge him into the night, he himself and slaps slowly. <br><br>  But last night I received a letter from the company Nvidia, which reported on the release of the new version of the <b>Movavi Video Converter</b> program with the serial number 9. It was also written that now the converter "received acceleration up to 4 times."  What acceleration is not specified, but I decided that the speed of video compression compared with compression by CPU.  Carnivorously rubbing my hands, I downloaded the novelty and set it on the file with the young comedy ‚ÄúYoung pranksters in London‚Äù (do not watch the children!), Which lasts 2 hours and 57 minutes. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The video card I have now is not very weak - GeForce 275 with 240 stream processors and a core frequency of 635 megahertz.  So on her movie pinned a little less than 23 minutes.  The chip warmed up to 80 degrees, the CPU load was a measly 22-25 percent.  The output was a gigabyte file, running which I was left, to put it mildly, was disappointed.  All the drawbacks of the badabuma were evident: ‚Äúdead‚Äù colors, total turbidity of the picture, twitching in dynamic scenes.  Of course, you can watch it, but, given that the program costs 29 dollars 95 cents, you want something a little more.

      I <b>launch XviD4PSP</b> - absolutely, I will note, free.  The program unobtrusively offers a couple of times to transfer to the seller any amount at its own discretion, but if you do not want to pay, no one will force you (I note, I myself translated, because such kosher things must be supported).  Compressing the same file in HQ Ultra mode took 35 minutes.  I note that this mode is rather harsh, providing excellent quality, and if the latter is not critical (for example, by compressing an average lousy series), you can save about 30-40 percent of the time.  But in this case I decided not to make a compromise. <br><br>  As it is easy to calculate, we cannot even talk about any fourfold acceleration.  And two-time does not smell.  Yes, my processor is not sick - Core i7 965, but it has already knocked him for more than a year, and the old man was removed from production.  Meanwhile, its slightly less productive counterpart Core i7 920 in retail can be found even cheaper than the GeForce 275. <br><br>  Yes, probably, in comparison with some Core 2 Duo E6300, the acceleration will be more serious.  Well, or with the old dual-core AMD.  That's just the quality of the picture it does not add.  And I have no complaints about the picture obtained by compression with CPU.  Clear, colors correct, jerking not noticed.  At the same time, the file size is even a little (40 megabytes) smaller than Movavi Video Converter. <br><br>  In short, everything is again, as in a joke about a secretary who printed 800 characters per minute, but the output was such nonsense ... I don‚Äôt even know how you can take money for such a result.  However, do they give? .. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/76462/">https://habr.com/ru/post/76462/</a></p>
