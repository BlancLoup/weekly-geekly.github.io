  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Bank branches of the future and who needs them</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  With the development of mobile applications and websites, the vast majority of banking services today have become available from home or from a mobile phone.  However, it would be a mistake to believe that in this connection all physical units will or should be closed.  This is eloquently shown by the desire of almost all the largest financial and technological companies operating exclusively online to create their own networks of physical departments.  These companies see the need for their clients to have the opportunity to personally communicate with qualified specialists and receive answers to their questions.  They understand that in order to make a decision, customers need to ‚Äútouch‚Äù products, ‚Äúfeel‚Äù them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/3d7/b39/00e/3d7b3900e1cc4ad09aa3a980482b3c7f.jpg" width="100%"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Thus, when organizations like banks come from the physical to the digital world, they should carefully weigh the pros and cons before discarding such a valuable asset as physical branches.  Because in many cases, those same digital companies that do not have a network of physical departments would give a lot to get a similar network. <br><br><h3>  Physical and digital channels complement each other </h3><br>  The measures taken by banks on the digital transformation of their business, obviously, contribute to the creation of new customer experience in digital channels, and this in turn means that many of the services that are traditionally offered in branches today can already be eliminated.  Banks need to rethink the role of their physical branches and stop providing those services through these branches that could be better accessed through digital channels.  However, it will be wrong to assume that all bank customers have access to such digital channels, or that all customers are sufficiently prepared or would like to use these new channels.

      But more importantly, in addition to the mandatory support of those customers who otherwise would have suffered from their inability or unwillingness to use digital services, <b>physical departments allow us to raise personal service and customer services</b> to a fundamentally new level.  Just as it is important for consumers to ‚Äútouch‚Äù and hold physical products in their hands, it is important for bank customers to be able to get personal support and advice when working with their bank.  Today, personal banking services are provided only for VIP clients.  In the future, since the number of day-to-day transactions with accounts will decrease, bank branches will be able to focus on offering personalized service to a wider range of clients.  Basic banking services will be provided through self-service kiosks, and qualified financial advisors will be able to provide more personalized support to bank customers. <br><br><h3>  Additional commercial returns </h3><br>  If the company managed to become the owner of such assets as a well-known brand, a famous logo or a network of physical departments that customers are accustomed to, then it would be foolish not to benefit from it.  Therefore, as a solution, banks should consider what else, in addition to traditional banking services, they can offer to their customers in order to take advantage of such valuable assets and their physical branches. <br><br>  <b>For many consumers, banks are the most reliable and trustworthy brands</b> that have experience with sensitive information and ensuring maximum confidentiality of personal data.  To build such a reputation from scratch in most industries is simply impossible.  Therefore, the main question about the future of bank branches (if you do not take into account the new composition of financial services) is how you can use the existing branch network to benefit partnerships, to promote products or services, and at the same time provide banks with appropriate business value.  The answer to this question will obviously become the main factor that will help transform the work of bank branches. <br><br>  How banks can rethink the work of their branches, and which digital services work best in the physical environment - on <a href="http://www.gemalto.com/next-gen-in-branch-services/">our website</a> (eng.)
