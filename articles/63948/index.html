  <section class="page js-page"><h1>BrainWork four months later ...</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In this post I would like to share our impressions about co-working, all the same, the fifth month has already gone :).  And, of course, to sum up, about the come true and there are no fears. <br>  So, you can start with the fact that before opening the center we read all the useful articles and blogs about coworking, and also, most importantly, we analyzed the work of our fellow interest from other cities - from all this we took into account the minuses and advantages, difficulties that can arise, fears, and finally opened up! <br>  Two months later, we can say that everything is going great!  We have become one good team, working on joint orders, constantly exchanging work and customers, and most importantly, when working together, we understand each other completely, which leads to the high quality of our orders.  Accordingly, customers and work are only added, many become permanent, new ones appear, and professionalism is only growing. <br>  Probably, everything depends on each of the guys and the team in general.  In this, we can say, we are very lucky, because we have become, truly, one big family! <br>  And now let's talk about the come true and there are no fears ... <br><br>  <b>They feared:</b> <br><br>  1. Difficulties with rent payment and late delivery of money from members of the center <br>  2. Loss of personal belongings <br>  3. The uselessness of the work of the coworking center itself <br>  4. The same level of the number of orders as at home, and maybe even a recession. <br>  5. And finally ... that the same routine will begin, from which we tried to run away from home to office.

      <b>What happened:</b> <br><br>  1. There were no difficulties with the rent, there were no problems with money and timeliness. <br>  2. At first, of course, there were fears, and we took valuable things (for example, beeches) home.  Now the fear is gone and confidence has appeared (and the beeches are in the workplaceÔÅä) <br>  3. The futility of even speech can not be!  The center is developing, and we are moving to a higher professional level. <br>  4. The number of orders has increased significantly, and the portfolio is rapidly getting fatter! <br>  5. This fear was not confirmed either.  We went away from all the difficulties of working at home - the productivity of work in the center has greatly increased (sometimes, we talk about what we have done for the day as much work as you barely manage to do at home in a week), and most importantly you stop feeling homemade (for example, , eggplant :)) <br><br>  <b>Eventually:</b> <br><br>  BrainWork center is rapidly developing and growing, and we come up with all the new ideas for an interesting life and enjoyable work! <br><br>  By the way, in the near future: <br>  1. Creating your site <br>  2. Conducting courses for beginner freelancers (video, audio and off lessons) <br>  3. darts and pin pong <br>  4. And also, the Office Party this Friday :) <br><br>  <b>Guys, who freelance in Togliatti, our doors are still open.</b>  <b>Join our BrainWork family!</b>  <b>:) (All the details on prices and TP <a href="http://office.munga.ru/brainwork/info">here</a> )</b> <br><br>  Thank you all, pleasant coworking! <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/NcI08S0IZy0&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiXQxP4Cowc29QE6HYSKDHJquekDg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/63948/">https://habr.com/ru/post/63948/</a></p>
