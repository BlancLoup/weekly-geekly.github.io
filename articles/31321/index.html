  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Social brake</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Social inhibition is what happens when you experience significant personal change, but everyone continues to treat you as before.  Suppose you decide to change your occupation.  Despite the fact that you are still working in the old place, your thoughts are already turning exclusively around the new, and soon your external reality will reflect this.  But the people around you have not yet realized your change.  It is unrealistic for them, and they continue to treat you as if there were no changes.  Has this ever happened to you? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Every significant change in my life was accompanied by an appropriate level of public inhibition.  When a person experiences a significant personal change, the rest of the world may need years to catch up with him.  This is especially noticeable in the example of relatives and friends whom you see not very often.  Your image in their heads often drifts behind you. <br><br>  Every time I experience a great personal change, it takes my distant relatives and friends some time to get used to it.  When, after graduating from college, I started Dexterity Software, my parents behaved as if I was looking for a job (as a college graduate should be).  They regularly sent me job offers by mail, but I sent them to the trash.  It took them two years to assimilate the idea that I run my own business, despite the fact that I made such a decision at the very beginning and never wanted to work for someone else.  I think that they finally understood this approximately when I received a check for 50 thousand dollars from the publisher.  Later, when I told them that I took part in an improvised comedy show, their reaction was genuine surprise.  For Steve 2004, this behavior really would have been a bit strange, but it was wonderfully combined with the image of Steve 2006. My local friends were not particularly surprised.  I have been making comic speeches for a year and a half. <br><br>  Another case of social inhibition occurs when artifacts of your old personality remain behind you, creating an impression of you as you were before, but not as you are now.  For example, when I was actively building Dexterity Software in the period from 1999 to 2002, I wrote several articles on the development and marketing of games.  These articles have become very popular, and I decided to leave them on the company's website, considering that people still benefit from them.  Dates of writing are listed at the bottom of each article.  Unfortunately, people who read these old articles today often react as if I wrote them only yesterday.  Moreover, people who knew me two years ago suggest that today I would give the same advice as a few years ago.  Nothing like this.  The situation around independent game developers has changed significantly since then.  If I were actively involved in the industry today, I would have done things differently.  My old articles served as advice on how to run the gaming business five years ago, and not how to conduct it today.  Most of the basic ideas are still valid, but more specific details are outdated.  Since the writing of these articles, the distribution model of shareware programs has undergone significant changes.  Today's independent developer should catch the puck where it is now, and not where it was before.

      It is because of the existence of social brakes in the gaming industry that the ghost of Steve Peacocks still exists.  People occasionally discuss his old ideas as if they were just born.  When you read some of the things attributed to him, it becomes a little sad.  Time flows, and he is carried away farther and farther, fulfilling the role prescribed by the social brake.  Social brake supports life in it.  Some people praise him for helping them.  Others reject because he once gave them bad advice.  But he exists only in their minds.  The real person who once gave birth to this ghost, has long gone ahead. <br><br>  Most often, a social brake is no more than an annoying circumstance, but it can become a more serious problem if it becomes a threat to slow down your movement or level progress.  You can accept, and then just ignore it - this method works well with acquaintances whom you leave behind in any case, for example, with colleagues in old work.  But if you are dealing with friends or relatives with whom you have to communicate for a long time, then I would advise you to do something to interrupt their old attitude towards you, thereby freeing up space for your new image. <br><br>  What is the best way to stop someone‚Äôs outdated way of treating you?  The most obvious answer is to verbally correct the person and remind him or her of your change.  With some people, this method works well, but often only for a short time - it lacks the strength to break old people's relationship patterns.  I believe that the approach with humor is more effective.  A little shock also works well if you apply it accordingly.  It is not necessary to burn a picture with your old image, but you can poke fun at the outdated attitude of a person towards you until it is imbued with a new one.  One of my favorite ways is relationship inversion.  You can make it clear to a person that his attitude towards you is outdated if you yourself begin to treat him in a humoristically outdated manner.  Thus, you reflect his attitude back and exaggerate it.  For example, you might start treating your divorced friend as if he was still married.  This will attract the attention of the person and encourage him to update your image in your mind.  For people with a healthy sense of humor, such as your evil game developer, a little teasing works well.  But people who are more sensitive to the emotions of others will be better influenced by a direct and sincere explanation.  Although I do not remember meeting such among game developers.  :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/31321/">https://habr.com/ru/post/31321/</a></p>
