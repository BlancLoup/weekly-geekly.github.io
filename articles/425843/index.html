Tutorials for adults are not suitable for children - the motivation to wade through the programming textbooks is not always enough for adults, and a child‚Äôs boring ‚Äúacademic‚Äù presentation can kill all interest in the subject on page five. <br><br>  Fortunately, at the time of this writing (the end of 2018) the choice was very wide - there are both translated and domestic books aimed at children and teenagers.  During the search, dropping out books on Python 2, I was able to find 10 fresh books on Python 3 for children, I studied each one of them live in offline stores, and I want to share the results of my research with you in the article under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  For the little ones - fun and with pictures </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xb/4o/tc/xb4otcqrsm6x6w_cu8aeeurwutw.jpeg" width="30%" align="left" alt="K.

      <b>Carol Vorderman</b> .  <a href="https://www.dk.com/uk/book/9781409347019-computer-coding-for-kids/">Computer Guide for Kids: A Unique Step-By-Step Visual Guide, From Binary Code to Buildings Game</a> , 224 pp. <br>  Publisher: DK Children, June 2014 <br>  ISBN: 978-1-40934-701-9, 978-0-24118-169-0 (eBook) <br><br>  Dorling Kindersley is the Ferrari of children's publishing houses.  Therefore, on the one hand, buying books with this logo, you can be confident in the quality of both text and printing, but on the other hand, Ferrari is not cheap.  All this applies to this particular book to the full - excellent printing quality, thoughtful and aimed at children's perception, but at a cost that is significantly higher than the average for the sample under consideration. <br><br>  This book is different from all the others in that its target audience is the youngest students, and their familiarity with programming does not begin immediately with Python, but with the visual programming language Scratch, the equivalent of which in our education system is PervoLogo.  The information in the book is distributed as follows: 64 pages are devoted to Scratch, 94 pages are Python, and the material is presented in comparison with Scratch, and the last two chapters on 45 pages tell about the organization of computers and the Internet. <br><br>  The only drawback of this edition from the point of view of the Russian-speaking reader is that the phrases in English used in the example programs are left without translation.  A small Russian reader at the target age probably still does not know English so freely as to be able to read them even with a dictionary - and without the help of parents, this is not enough, but reading skills in English can also be improved. <br>  The printing quality of the publication is excellent, color printing on good white paper, a semi-solid cover, and a sewn block ensures durability and reliability. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oz/ma/m6/ozmam6_ckarbhqwng2umxjyh2u0.jpeg" width="30%" align="left" alt="K.

Vorderman and others. <br>  <a href="https://www.mann-ivanov-ferber.ru/books/programmirovanie-na-python/">Programming in Python: An Illustrated Guide for Children</a> , 224 pp. </h3>  Publisher: Mann, Ivanov and Ferber, 2018 <br>  ISBN: 978-5-00117-399-1 <br>  <b>Carol Vorderman</b> .  <a href="https://www.dk.com/uk/book/9780241286869-computer-coding-python-projects-for-kids/">Computer Coding Python Projects for Kids</a> , 224 pp. <br>  Publisher: DK Children, June 2017. <br>  ISBN: 978-0-24128-686-9, 978-0-24131-432-6 (eBook) <br><br>  The next book in the same serial design for more advanced children.  All 224 pages are entirely devoted only to Python, and this time the publisher including translated all the phrases from the sample programs into Russian.  The text of the book and example programs do not duplicate the previous edition - here everything is different, the order of presentation is also slightly different. <br><br>  And so that you know, Carol Worderman is never a programmer, but a TV star who has led the super-popular puzzle show Countdown for 26 years, under her name as a promoted brand in Britain, a fair amount of science fiction for children has been published.  Her name on the cover helped the book to be sold, and the rest of the team of 5 authors hiding behind the abbreviation ‚Äúet al.‚Äù Was in charge of the qualitative content. The same story with the previous book - only a set of 5 real authors is slightly different. <br>  The quality of the printing of the publication is excellent, color printing on good white paper, half-hard cover, embroidered block. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bh/z2/rt/bhz2rtfjygwenkgnyvvekehebiu.jpeg" width="30%" align="left" alt="Python programming for kids"><h3>  <a href="https://ast.ru/book/programmirovanie-dlya-detey-na-yazyke-python-832137/">Programming for children in Python</a> , 96 pp. </h3>  Publisher: AST, 2017 <br>  ISBN: 978-5-17982-809-9 <br>  <b>Louie Stowell</b> .  <a href="https://usborne.com/browse-books/catalogue/product/1/11315/coding-for-beginners-using-python/">Coding for Beginners using Python</a> , 96 pp. <br>  Publisher: Usborne Publishing Ltd, March 2017. <br>  ISBN: 978-1-40959-934-0, 978-0-79453-950-4 <br><br>  If the price tags of the first two books in the review hit you unpleasantly - then, fortunately, we have a more affordable option for younger people!  Lost authorship in the process of publication in Russian, the book of Louis Sowell is without any discounts a worthy alternative to the previous edition of DK, and is much cheaper.  The number of pages is less here - but the book itself is of a larger format, and of a more compact layout, so the volume of the material is almost the same. <br><br>  In this edition, as well as in the first book of the review, phrases in English from examples of programs into Russian are not translated, the young programmer will need a dictionary or help of parents.  But knowledge of the language is not superfluous - so the lack of translation can be considered a plus. <br>  The quality of the printing of the publication is excellent, color printing on good paper, half-hard cover, embroidered block. <br><br><h2>  For those who are older - more serious and smaller pictures </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qp/55/hj/qp55hj1c6eoh8s79kfzm_mwful8.jpeg" width="30%" align="left" alt="D.

The number of positive reviews about it on the Internet is enormous - and the book is really good, but with one important caveat: on the structure, this is more of a textbook than a self-help book.  With color pictures, but here is a straightforward classic school textbook, with an appropriate approach to the presentation: everything is consistent, with practice, explained in great detail in the calculation for the first time confronted with programming, but, alas, with almost no intermediate results supporting the interest.  As a textbook for courses / circles, it is generally ideal, provided that some side interest activity is added.  English phrases in the examples translated. <br><br>  The quality of the printing of the publication is excellent, color printing on good white paper, dense soft cover, embroidered block. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/47/tn/6c/47tn6ctwzamfa2rkddqe7pwv9ve.jpeg" width="30%" align="left" alt="B.

Of the advantages - the material on the language in it is set out much more than in the "children's" books, but this edition will not work for a child. <br><br>  The quality of printing at a minimum: black and white printing on newsprint, very soft cover, glued block. <br><br><h2>  We learn, playing - it is also possible! </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tc/l7/ws/tcl7wsfgglmdnen3wbahhmj4vhs.jpeg" width="30%" align="left" alt="E.

There is no reader involvement in learning - unlike other books in the review.  For the ‚ÄúHYIP‚Äù, the translation publisher called the games from the book ‚Äúcool‚Äù - however, the author did not promise any particular ‚Äútoughness‚Äù in the original, the games in the book are quite ‚Äúordinary‚Äù, although quite diverse.  From the pros - the presentation goes consistently from simple to complex, and you can really learn how to program from scratch with purely gaming examples from the book.  No pictures, English phrases in the examples translated. <br><br>  Unfortunately, the quality of the printing of this edition is pumped up - black and white printing on white, but translucent paper (shines through the text from the turnover and the next page), plus the texts of the programs are typed in small print (Condensed font).  This, alas, does not add convenience to perception - it is actually harder to read than if the paper was originally a newsprint (for example, see the last book in the previous section of the review).  Dense soft cover, glued block. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/c0/kr/j1/c0krj1wxwan1wue_awajh7hb9wm.jpeg" width="30%" align="left" alt="K. Richardson.

With the help of the proposed examples of programs, you can get up in the world of Minecraft such that it is extremely difficult to create manually.  Actually, learning goes according to the classical scheme from simple to complex, in each chapter the reader learns new tricks and immediately sees the result.  For involvement in the learning process, an unusual technique is used - in terms of the examples of programs, small blocks of code are intentionally omitted, which the reader is invited to write independently, guided by a detailed description of the missing functionality and knowledge obtained in previous chapters.  The ‚Äúaggravating‚Äù moment compared with the books above is the need for a parallel study of the internal structure of Minecraft - but for the fan it‚Äôs all about charm. <br><br>  The quality of the printing of the publication is excellent, color printing on good white paper, dense soft cover, embroidered block. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2c/y4/cr/2cy4crof-msrrodtlxw2sbceaxu.jpeg" width="30%" align="left" alt="D.
