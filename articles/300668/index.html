  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The ‚Äúsecrecy‚Äù of the Palantir startup has a beneficial effect on its reputation among investors.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palantir">Palantir Technologies</a> is a privately held American company that develops data analysis software.  Its main customers are special services, investment banks, hedge funds. <br><br>  Palantir is in third place in the <a href="http://graphics.wsj.com/billion-dollar-club/">list of the</a> most expensive startups in the world.  Its valuation <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/palantir-just-raised-880-million-2015-12">exceeds</a> $ 20 billion. <br><br>  However, over the past year, the Palantir business has declined.  Such a conclusion was <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/williamalden/inside-palantir-silicon-valleys-most-secretive-company%3Futm_term%3D.dl0746GW0">made</a> by Buzzfeed edition, having studied the company's internal documents.  In addition, the correspondents of the publication talked with six employees who work or worked in Palantir.

      At the end of 2015, the company's business did not bring profits, and its costs exceeded $ 500 million. <br><br>  Representatives of Palantir in an official statement indicated that the company earned $ 1.7 billion on "orders". <a name="habracut"></a>  However, in fact, Palantir received only $ 420 million in cash.  This amount did not exceed 50% of the result of the previous year. <br><br>  Over the past 13 months, major customers such as <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0-%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0">Coca-Cola</a> , <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASDAQ">Nasdaq,</a> and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD_%25D0%25AD%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2581_%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8">American Express have</a> ceased collaboration with the company.  One reason was the price for the fifth year of the contract, which reached $ 18 million.  On average, the price for using the company's software is $ 1 million per month. <br><br>  In 2016, 100 employees left Palantir, including some managers.  If the outflow of personnel will occur at the same pace, the proportion of employees who quit this year will reach 20%.  This is twice the results of previous years.  Palantir CEO Alex Karp announced that he would increase salaries to employees who have worked for the company for more than 18 months by 20%.  At the same time, he said that the system of feedback on labor productivity and quality of work of employees does not work and will not be taken into account when paying. <br><br>  A company spokeswoman Lisa Gordon, by contrast, argues that the Palantir business is developing, despite the outflow of employees and customers.  Human Resources Director Gavin Hood is confident that this is a natural development process for the company.  He also added that Palantir has a strong corporate culture, and not every employee will be able to fit into it. <br><br>  Over the entire history of its existence, Palantir has raised $ 2.42 billion in investment.  The company was founded in 2004 by Peter Thiel of Pay Pal and a well-known investor, Joe Lonsdale.  Both founders are still at the head of the company. <br><br>  It cannot be said that Palantir is widely known.  This is partly due to the fact that some of the company's activities are kept secret.  So, some experts believe that Palantir has developed a program for secretly collecting information - <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0_%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8)">PRISM</a> . <br><br>  Therefore, there is information that the company really does not have the right to disclose. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300668/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300668/</a></p>
