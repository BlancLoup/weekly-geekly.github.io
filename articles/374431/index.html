Hyperloop TT will work with a partner, Aldar Properties PJSC, in Abu Dhabi.  The first line will be very short and close to the border between Abu Dhabi and Dubai.  If all goes well, then Hyperloop will develop and grow, spreading like a cobweb across the UAE. <br><br>  The length of the first tunnel will be only about ten kilometers.  Next, a line of high-speed transport will be laid in the direction of Al-Maktoum International Airport and even further - to the Dubai Expo (the venue of the World Exhibition in 2020).  So far, the exact configuration of the path is unknown, but it can be assumed that the Hyperloop will run parallel to the E311 or E611 highways. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/952/018/42a/95201842a7d4891af2e33f443030733e.jpg">

      By the way, Aldar Properties PJSC - the developer.  The company Hyperloop TT has previously entered into contracts with developers.  One of them was signed by a participant in the implementation of the eco-city Quay Valley, which is located between Los Angeles and San Francisco.  This city will get its own highway Hyperloop, which will be used by residents of the village.  But if the Arabs invest a significant amount of money in the project, they can be the first to create Hyperloop. <br><br>  True, Abu Dhabi is not the only location where high-speed transport will soon appear.  Already, Hyperloop Transportation Technologies <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/04/12/hyperloop-tt-begins-construction-of-its-first-test-track/">is</a> building in France, and not just one branch, but two at once.  The first elements of the tunnels arrived at the test site in Toulouse.  The first section of the network will not be too big - just 320 meters.  And it is clear that no one will roll passengers on it.  This is still an experiment that should show how quickly a safe and functional tunnel can be built. <br><br>  As soon as the first tests are carried out, and they show the reliability of the entire system, the length will be increased to a kilometer.  By the way, the elements of the route will not lie on the ground, they will be raised to a height of about 5 meters so that everything corresponds to the original idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Mask.  By the way, this route will also be completed by 2019. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/41f/46c/bbc/41f46cbbc6f6a43fbc80c91c31281985.jpg"><br><br>  Capsule for Hyperloop is being built in Carbures, Spain.  She may be ready this summer.  The capsule can accommodate 28-40 people.  Its speed should reach about 1300 km / h.  Of course, this is still only a theory, but after the completion of the development, the authors of the project will conduct tests. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/973/198/d5d/973198d5d670d0dd3bd0d16a302c2bcf.jpg"><br><br>  It is worth recalling that Hyperloop HTT has a competitor, this is Virgin Hyperloop One.  The company is now supported by Richard Branson, who also has a lot of tools and abilities.  Hyperloop One, the name of the company before, had already managed to conduct technical tests of its infrastructure in the open air in 2016.  Then the company tested the electric motor for capsules.  Relatively recently, regular tests were conducted with a full-scale model of a capsule on a track half a kilometer long. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/01b/276/6e5/01b2766e515ed69998cb6e3283895a4d.jpg"><br><br>  The following is still said about Branson: ‚ÄúHe has always been interested in the future of transport, whether it be space or Earth, and he has been managing a railway company in the UK for over 20 years.‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d9b/68d/5a4/d9b68d5a477b1789bf4c9cebc7d3aaac.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to Hyperloop, the entrepreneur also has Virgin Galactic, a company promoting the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãspace tourism.  She recently tested her vehicle and is gradually moving toward space flight.  And so far it is unclear whether it will be the first flight into space or the ‚Äúflight‚Äù of the Hyperloop capsule in the tunnel.  The main thing is that both companies and other companies are developing, and the realization of the entrepreneur‚Äôs plans is not far off. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/374431/">https://habr.com/ru/post/374431/</a></p>
