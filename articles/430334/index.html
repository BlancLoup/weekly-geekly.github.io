During this time, the ISS was visited by 398 cosmonauts.  They carried out more than 110 man-days in open space for the process of assembling and maintaining the station.  And the total number of experiments that were carried out and continue to be carried out at the station exceeded 1.5 thousand! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Prerequisites of creation </h3><br>  In 1984, in the United States, it was decided to build an international station ‚ÄúFreedom‚Äù in cooperation with Canada, Japan and Europe.  However, as the project worked out, it turned out that its implementation would cost too much.  At the same time, in Russia, the replacement of the Mir station, the resource of which was coming to an end, was decided to build the Mir-2 station.  However, Russia also faced the exact same problem of insufficient funding for the implementation of its plans. <br><br>  In this regard, the United States and Russia signed on June 17, 1992 an agreement on cooperation in the field of space exploration, according to which the Mir-Shuttle project soon began to be implemented.  Soon began negotiations on the creation of a unified station, which absorbed the developments in the stations "Freedom" and "Mir-2".  The agreement on the creation of the ISS was signed on January 28, 1998 between 15 countries: Russia, USA, Japan, Canada and the countries-participants of the European Space Agency ( <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2595%25D0%25B2%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE">ESA</a> ) of France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK.

And if according to NASA plans all scientific modules have already been launched by this time, then Roskosmos has plans to launch <a href="https://ria.ru/science/20130326/929058475.html">three more</a> such modules: MLM (called <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259D%25D0%25B0%25D1%2583%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0_(%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D1%2583%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C_%25D0%259C%25D0%259A%25D0%25A1)">‚ÄúScience‚Äù</a> ), <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259D%25D0%25B0%25D1%2583%25D1%2587%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE-%25D1%258D%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D1%2583%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C">NEM-1</a> and NEM-2. <br><br>  It is not surprising that the distribution of scientific results from the ISS is not in our favor: there are <a href="http://knts.tsniimash.ru/ru/site/Direction.aspx">320 experiments</a> conducted in the Russian segment of the station (you can see the list of them <a href="http://knts.tsniimash.ru/ru/site/Publication.aspx">here</a> ), and according to different data, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/explorer/search.html%3F">1507</a> or <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/experiments_by_name.html">1534</a> items.  This is <a href="https://zelenyikot.com/science-without-science/">confirmed by the</a> statistics on scientific publications mentioning the ISS: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fn/fu/3e/fnfu3ex5efw6izef0xhtljxzvg0.jpeg"><br><br>  In addition to the lack of scientific equipment, the reason for such a huge gap is the difficulty in preparing the entire necessary package of documents necessary for conducting an experiment on the Russian segment of the ISS, and Roscosmos has been working <a href="https://iz.ru/648319/dmitrii-strugovetc/nauka-pridet-na-mks">to simplify</a> this process for over a year.  The launch of the ‚ÄúScience‚Äù module according to the current plans should take place at the end of 2019, but the launch transfer to 2020 (it was originally planned to be carried out in <a href="https://www.gazeta.ru/social/2011/10/19/3806658.shtml">2007</a> ) is <a href="https://ria.ru/science/20181119/1533054557.html">not excluded</a> .  The NEM-2 module completely disappeared from the plans, and the launch of the remaining NEM is planned in <a href="https://tass.ru/interviews/5460502">2022</a> .  In <a href="https://vk.com/%40inspaceroom-partnery-po-mks-hotyat-prodleniya-srokov-ee-ekspluatacii">early October,</a> it became known that all participants in the cooperation of the ISS spoke in favor of extending the operation of the ISS until 2030.  If these plans are realized, then Roskosmos will have good chances not only to complete the Russian segment of the station, but also to get scientific results from the commissioning of these two modules to the end of the ISS operation time. <br><br><h3>  Space junk </h3><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9m/3a/zu/9m3azupuw83qsteq5p7pe2nv7_s.jpeg"></a> <br>  <i>Samples after testing from left to right: an aluminum block 10 cm thick after hitting a plastic particle 2.5 cm in diameter at a speed of 6.76 km / s;</i>  <i>3.8 cm aluminum platform after being hit by an aluminum cylinder of 6 mm in diameter and 12 mm in length at a speed of 6.41 km / s;</i>  <i>external station electrical cable after hitting an aluminum ball of 3.2 mm in diameter at a speed of 6.9 km / s.</i> <br><br>  <a href="https://tass.ru/kosmos/2244110">Roskosmos</a> and <a href="https://habr.com/post/188286/">NASA</a> have the ability to track objects with dimensions of 10 cm or more.  At the same time, station's protective screens are able to withstand hit of objects <a href="http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Operations/Space_debris_hazards_spotlighted_at_conference">up to 1 cm</a> .  About 670 thousand objects of space debris in various orbits around the Earth are in the ‚Äúblind zone‚Äù of 1-10 cm.  At the same time, despite the fact that new types of classical protection based on <a href="https://tass.ru/kosmos/2123909">composites are</a> being developed for the station, as well as completely exotic projects using <a href="https://ria.ru/space/20180516/1520648119.html">lasers</a> , but so far on the planning horizon there are no deadlines for implementing such projects in practice. <br><br>  This might seem like a criminal negligence or even a desire to save cosmonauts on safety, but in reality the probability of encountering a space debris object (despite their impressive number, measured in thousands and even millions) is extremely small.  Although cases of collisions of the ISS with small debris <a href="https://habr.com/post/393919/">occur</a> periodically, but over the 20 years of the station‚Äôs existence, there has not been a single case of body breakdown with a micrometeorite or a piece of space debris (the case of the ill-fated Soyuz MS-09 ship was probably drilled <a href="https://tass.ru/kosmos/5528667">out earth</a> ).  Therefore, protection is selected based on a reasonable degree of risk minimization. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-i/pt/01/-ipt01veyf6mzcjtmoasowgocki.png"><br>  <i>Monthly number of space debris according to the US space observation network: the explosion of the Ablestar upper stage at an altitude of 800 km - about 300 objects ( <a href="http://www.spacesafetymagazine.com/space-debris/mitigation/">60%</a> of them remained in orbit in 2011);</i>  <i>HAPS top stage <a href="https://gizmodo.com/a-history-of-garbage-in-space-1572783046">explosion</a> - 700 objects;</i>  <i>Fengyun 1C <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Chinese_anti-satellite_missile_test">test of</a> Chinese anti-satellite weapons - about 3000 objects;</i>  <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmos_2421">Cosmos-2421</a> satellite explosion - 500 objects;</i>  <i><a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2581%25D0%25BF%25D1%2583%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2_%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581-2251_%25D0%25B8_Iridium_33">collision of</a> satellites Iridium-33 and Cosmos-2251.</i> <br><br><h3>  Statistics </h3><br>  Here is the distribution of the astronauts who participated in the long expeditions to the ISS (usually their duration is six months): <br><table><tbody><tr><th>  A country </th><th>  The number of astronauts </th></tr><tr><td>  USA </td><td>  54 </td></tr><tr><td>  Russia </td><td>  40 </td></tr><tr><td>  Japan </td><td>  7 </td></tr><tr><td>  Germany </td><td>  3 </td></tr><tr><td>  Italy </td><td>  3 </td></tr><tr><td>  France </td><td>  2 </td></tr><tr><td>  Canada </td><td>  2 </td></tr><tr><td>  Belgium </td><td>  one </td></tr><tr><td>  Netherlands </td><td>  one </td></tr><tr><td>  Great Britain </td><td>  one </td></tr><tr><td>  Total </td><td>  114 </td></tr></tbody></table>  And here is the number of people who have ever visited the ISS: <br><table><tbody><tr><th>  A country </th><th>  Number of flights </th><th>  The number of astronauts </th><th>  Notes </th></tr><tr><td>  USA </td><td>  263 </td><td>  146 </td><td>  28 women, 5 tourists, 63 flew twice, 21 three times and 4 four times </td></tr><tr><td>  Russia </td><td>  89 </td><td>  47 </td><td>  1 woman, 16 flew twice, 8 three times, 1 four times and 2 flew 5 times </td></tr><tr><td>  Japan </td><td>  14 </td><td>  9 </td><td>  1 woman, 2 flew twice and 1 thrice </td></tr><tr><td>  Canada </td><td>  9 </td><td>  7 </td><td>  1 woman, 1 tourist, 2 flew twice </td></tr><tr><td>  Italy </td><td>  9 </td><td>  five </td><td>  1 woman, 2 flew three times </td></tr><tr><td>  France </td><td>  four </td><td>  four </td><td>  1 woman </td></tr><tr><td>  Germany </td><td>  five </td><td>  3 </td><td>  2 flew twice </td></tr><tr><td>  Belgium </td><td>  2 </td><td>  one </td><td>  1 flew twice </td></tr><tr><td>  Netherlands </td><td>  2 </td><td>  one </td><td>  1 flew twice </td></tr><tr><td>  Sweden </td><td>  2 </td><td>  one </td><td>  1 flew twice </td></tr><tr><td>  Brazil </td><td>  one </td><td>  one </td><td>  - </td></tr><tr><td>  Denmark </td><td>  one </td><td>  one </td><td>  - </td></tr><tr><td>  Kazakhstan </td><td>  one </td><td>  one </td><td>  - </td></tr><tr><td>  Malaysia </td><td>  one </td><td>  one </td><td>  - </td></tr><tr><td>  South Africa </td><td>  one </td><td>  one </td><td>  1 tourist </td></tr><tr><td>  South Korea </td><td>  one </td><td>  one </td><td>  1 woman </td></tr><tr><td>  Spain </td><td>  one </td><td>  one </td><td>  - </td></tr><tr><td>  Great Britain </td><td>  one </td><td>  one </td><td>  - </td></tr><tr><td>  Total </td><td>  407 </td><td>  232 </td><td>  34 women, 7 tourists, 88 flew twice, 32 three times, 5 four times and 2 flew 5 times </td></tr></tbody></table> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hs/9n/i3/hs9ni33y1ycrbm8kwbqswyes-to.jpeg"></a> <br>  <i>Composite shot of 9 shots of the ISS transit across the solar disk.</i>  <i>October 7, 2018.</i> <br><br>  A total of 212 spacewalks were performed from the ISS, with 2 cosmonauts taking part in each of them.
