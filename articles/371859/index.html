But unfortunately, not everyone manages to win a month of communication with Ekaterina Makarova, but what about the iPhone?  Well I do not know.  At the beginning of winter, I somehow saw a homeless man with an iPhone in his hands, and even though the model was not the freshest 4 or even 3, and the screen cracked, but nevertheless, he stood at the trash can and ‚Äútryndel‚Äù on the ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù!  And if ‚Äúit‚Äù happens even to the homeless, then how can I look with ‚Äúthis‚Äù stylish or ‚Äúnot like everyone else‚Äù?  Well, or at least strange? <br>  So, as I like gadget lovers, I have to scour the shops and flea markets in search of fresh meat.  But this time, especially not to scour.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ef0/18e/192/ef018e19245649f7b7bd41b7b9687736.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Highscreen Power Ice is an ‚Äúexclusive‚Äù project of the company with a newcomer to the Russian expanse - the JD.com trading platform.  You can buy there (it turns out a little cheaper) and in the company's online store Highscreen <a href="http://shop.highscreen.ru/catalog/smartfony/highscreen-power-ice-blue/">here</a> . <br><br>  The Highscreen brand itself has long been surprising customers with various technological solutions.  In any case, among smartphones. <br>  Suffice it to recall the highscreen Hippo primitive phablet with its 5-inch display, which appeared in 2010, about a year before the announcement of the first Samsung Galaxy Note, or if you take the Highscreen Cosmo with its cool backlighting?  In other words, this brand may still surprise us.  And it's nice. <br><br>  Highscreen also handles car video recorders.  They say also quite good.  But I don‚Äôt use registrars - ‚Äúthe court forbade me‚Äù ... <br><br>  If I were somehow Gollum, I probably would have licked this smartphone with a rumbling about my darling, but as part of the import-replacement I would rather stay with Panikovsky - and just hold on to this smartphone stronger, as in the very desire of a goose, and tell you what it is can we have from it, that's the kind of thing that makes us buy Highscreen Power Ice? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7ab/39e/387/7ab39e38700c4c5bafb1aeddc89e6a49.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f9b/6fc/5b9/f9b6fc5b94cd4e029f14c893a7e3b8a2.jpg"><br><br>  And with this goose, we can have: <br><br>  Firstly, the appearance of the smartphone itself.  Its appearance is a definite plus among rather similar smartphones that fill the shelves like twins. <br>  And in general, I think that's just the look and build is the first separate argument in favor of buying it.  Probably everyone has different tastes, but I definitely like it!  And I think like many. <br>  Under the unassumingly white box, there is a noble-colored smartphone called dark blue, although I would call it rather gray or grayish.  But this is of course if you did not get the golden version of the colors.  I am not a Persian from South Park, so I don‚Äôt like golden colors, but such ones.  Gloomy.  Severe.  For men! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fb5/a9d/f28/fb5a9df283de412089fed8b4f95869f3.jpg"><br><br>  Although in principle it comes with a case that can cover the color if it seems too unpleasant and modest to you.  Some users even go so far as to remove the back cover using a case. <br><br>  The use of metal in the elements of its body also warms the soul pleasantly.  Metal instead of solid and omnipresent plastic is rare.  The metal has its own charm in any form.  Maybe "hands in the cold will be cool," but it is not as slippery as plastic and the presence of metal still makes the smartphone more impressive than that smartphone, which is assembled from one plastic.  Especially with a fairly good assembly of the case, when nothing falls off in the hands, but on the contrary it feels almost ‚Äúarmor-piercing‚Äù.  And the weight is so solid and not ‚Äútoy‚Äù, but at the same time not too heavy, and this all together gives the impression of an all-metal bar of such a pretty color than it reminds me of the army or navy. <br>  Do you even wonder if you should wear it in the enclosed case?  I would prefer Fuerte, although on the other hand, to pay for the case more than for a smartphone?  That would be really weird ... <br><br>  It is surprising how with a capacious battery the smartphone came out noticeably thin. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ddc/796/9b3/ddc7969b39b2400b8e0bf4e0a02cafe6.jpg"><br><br>  In his hand, he lies completely free, not even immediately recall that this is a 5 '' smartphone, and not 4.7 ''.  Managing a smartphone does not pose any problems, although maybe it‚Äôs just my fingers that are long and my hands cramming? <br><br>  And in principle, this can be done with the outer part of the carcass of our goose, going to its essence, because the goose is not only an externally appetizing fried crust, it must also be inside suitable for "use"!  You won't be fed up with crust, and we buy a smartphone not only to look at it! <br><br>  And we secondly, with our gray goose, we have its technical characteristics: <br><br>  ‚óè Display: 5 ‚Äù, 1280x720, IPS / ONCELL / Asahi Dragontrail Glass, <br>  ‚óè Processor: MediaTek MT6735, 4 cores, 1.3 GHz, 28nm, 64 bits, <br>  ‚óè Graphics chip: Mali-T720MP2, RAM: 2 GB, <br>  ‚óè Internal memory: 16 GB, <br><br>  ‚óè Camera: 8 megapixel, autofocus, LED flash, max.  1080p video recording * 30, H264, stereo, <br>  ‚óè Front camera: 5 MP, <br>  ‚óè Memory card: microSD and microSDHC, <br><br>  ‚óè Communication: GSM / GPRS / EDGE (850/900/1800/1900 MHz), WCDMA / HSPA (900/2100), FDD-LTE (1800/2100/2600 MHz), <br>  ‚óè Two microSIM slots, in Dual Standby mode, <br>  ‚óè Navigation: GPS and GLONASS, <br>  ‚óè Other interfaces: Wi-Fi (802.11b / g / n), Bluetooth 4.0, microUSB, OTG mode and 3.5mm audio jack, <br>  ‚óè Battery: 4000 mAh, can not be removed.  Lithium polymer <br><br>  ‚óè Dimensions: 143 x 69.9 x 8.5 mm, <br>  ‚óè Platform: Android 5.1 Lollipop. <br><br>  Generally, if it were not for the ruble exchange rate jumps, this ‚Äúexclusive‚Äù really would not have been equal, but even now, at a price within ten thousand, the smartphone in terms of ‚Äúprice and performance‚Äù looks great among competitors.  Although these "competitors" are generally so-so.  Against their background, many things will look great - after all, the exchange difference raised the price of all kinds of junk to the price level of things standing, and smartphones sold at a discount can easily be lost in heaps of garbage. <br>  Some competitors will have a price similar to Highscreen Power Ice, others - some specifications on the same level or even slightly higher than it - the same 2 gigabytes of memory, but a 13 megapixel camera. <br>  But here are the companies that produce these competitors?  Rather, "brands."  Here they have specific doubts.  Let's say <i>Noname</i> from <s>there should have been a brand of the company, but we honor the law on advertising</s> offered to me in one of the salons - it seems to be all the same characteristics, almost the same forms and appearance, the price can be even a little lower, and consulting managers in shopping malls, so praised him, so praised ... But an unnamed brand above?  No thanks.  Together with advertising, I saw a lot of reviews about the unsurpassed low quality of this brand, with the lack of real support, and felt all these delights on myself.  Price and advertising "from managers", in this case, these are not the arguments that make me buy at least something forgetting about the name.  I‚Äôd better pay a little more now ... So that I don‚Äôt cry too much. <br><br>  And that's just how Highscreen doesn‚Äôt yet belong to ‚Äúsuper-megakul‚Äù brands, yet it has more arguments in favor of its purchase.  And the biggest argument in favor of Highscreen Power Ice is its battery. <br>  Until now, I have met smartphones with a battery with a capacity of 2500-2750 mAh, which I had to adjust, optimize and think about interruptions in use.  No, I have not been without a smartphone in the middle of a working day for a long time - only a smartphone with the letter P, which, for the night, without optimizing, could spend about half of the battery only on the standby mode, with the canceled, was really ‚Äúrotten‚Äù in terms of battery consumption. screen.  All the rest of my smartphones behaved more decently. <br>  Easy setup of power consumption and disconnection of a pair of processor cores in standby mode, moderate use, and for two days I was provided on any smartphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8e3/d9a/706/8e3d9a7069bb428a86bac563556abc4c.jpg"><br><br>  But Highscreen Power Ice is really the first smartphone I got that allows me not to think about optimization.  You can just use it.  Just work.  Sounds good? <br>  The battery is not removable, lithium-polymer, and even reinforced :) and most importantly it is honest - at the declared 4000 mAh!  Tested more than once by independent tests, probes and other instrumentation.  The practice of consumption is also about the same in all cases - twelve hours of work - this is about 30 percent battery consumption.  WiFi activity, the load in the form of games increases energy consumption, but the inclusion of its own optimization mode instantly evens out the situation.  So you can work for a long time! <br>  Unlike most smartphones, Power Ice will really allow you to quietly spend the entire night shift for enjoying watching movies with Ekaterina Makarova on the Internet.  Well, or you can look at the news ... <br><br>  In general, it is necessary to think well not about how to pull the charge up in the morning, but what exactly to do ... <br><br>  The screen was quite bright, clear, with good viewing angles.  Glass, though stated as Asahi Dragontrail Glass in my opinion is not much worse than Gorilla Glass, I didn‚Äôt beat with a hammer, but I didn‚Äôt notice the difference to the touch - except that the oleophobic coating is not so resistant, but this is absolutely indifferent to me!  Everywhere and everywhere I try to use a matte film for screens.  I do not like shine.  Well, I'm not a Persian!  The resolution is actually a standard 1280x720 pixels, 320 dpi.  More for happiness and not necessary. <br>  In fact, there is nothing more to say about this screen - it shows pictures perfectly, there are no pixels visible.  Cinema twists too well.  The minimum brightness in the dark looks normal and does not burn your eyes.  The only thing that may need to adjust the "warmth" of color.  But this is someone who likes it - here everyone really has different tastes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b3e/489/dea/b3e489deabb749df898ab1597eb4fe59.jpg"><br><br>  There are no touch keys.  Saving? <br><br>  And with this you can smoothly go to the rest of the hardware and software stuff at once.  There is nothing special about it.  The sensations from it are mostly purely subjective.  I liked it here, and I don‚Äôt have any big complaints about what I use most often. <br><br>  The overall high performance is ensured by the MediaTek processor, which is quite productive and familiar to us - the MT6735 has 4 cores of 1.3 GHz, 2 GB of memory is also installed in the smartphone, there is a Mali-720 MP2 video accelerator.  And with all this in the Antutu test, we gain: in version 5.7 approximately 27-28 thousand points, in the new version 6.0 - 32-33 thousand points! <br>  Probably impressive?  I am not sure that it is these numbers that should tell me about something - after all, I use not synthetic tests, but more real programs.  But in them, too, everything is fine.  Racing, "shooters", everything goes smoothly, without friezes, with good quality and knocking out brains by mounting to any mutant who jumped out of a cave at you, as easy as driving a racing car on slippery asphalt. <br><br>  Programs that have a more practical sense also go off with a bang - I do not do the calculation of the trajectory of ballistic missiles, but the maps, the translator, the telephone itself, the recording of a telephone conversation, the reading of books ‚Äî all this works very quickly.  And switching between programs hanging in the background is easy and simple. <br><br>  The operating system is Android 5.1, the official update to version 6 is still foggy, but I think romodels will be able to help - as soon as a smartphone will turn out to be an enthusiast with straight arms and a passion for an upgrade.  I have often come across a situation when trying a new, just released smartphone, complained that there is nothing but official firmware.  How immediately appeared a pair of Zionogonmodes or adapted MIUI.  Especially if the smartphone had a ‚Äúvenerable ancestor‚Äù, similar in hardware and already having alternative firmware. <br><br>  Among the sensors there is a compass which after normal calibration works normally.  I can not imagine why he is in the city, but it's nice to have it at hand.  You can always find out where the north is, where the south is not trying to find an anthill. <br><br>  If it is interesting why messages from messengers do not come, then we go to the settings where we find the ‚ÄúAlert Center‚Äù, look for the ‚ÄúManage Notes‚Äù there, and turn on the ‚ÄúPriority‚Äù. <br><br>  The connection is very good, 4G uses only one, but any of the two sim cards, although it may require the replacement of a sim card or a forced switch on the operator, but after that in 4G all Russian frequencies are caught without any problems.  In general, it would be strange to expect anything else from the phone intended specifically for the Russian market - after all, this is their advantage over smartphones bought on Aliexpress - by those that our officials and representatives of trading networks terribly call "gray", attributing to them almost all the evil of the world - but the truth is that the whole difference between ‚Äúgray‚Äù and ‚Äúwhite‚Äù is only the absence or presence of adaptation for Russia.  The real evil is ‚Äúsmuggling‚Äù, but the ‚Äúgray‚Äù phone is just some inconvenience for the user. <br><br>  But in this case, the excitement is superfluous - all the smartphones of the Highscreen Power Ice model are ‚Äúwhite‚Äù, this model is specially created for sale in Russia. <br>  When talking, the sound is good.  I do not know what exactly you can complain about?  It doesn‚Äôt matter if I use the speakerphone or the phone‚Äôs speaker, I don‚Äôt have any ‚Äúbucket effects‚Äù, rattles, layers of cotton wool and other ‚Äúspecial effects‚Äù usually occurring in budget models.  I hear well, I hear well. <br>  Even music played through the speakerphone sounds decent.  Although in my opinion is pale, it feels like the tops and bottoms are cropped.  But in my childhood, a bear came to my ear, and I could be wrong.  Especially since I usually listen to music through the headset. <br><br>  WiFi in principle is also quite quick, it catches everything very quickly, it works stably at 2.4 GHz and at 5 GHz.  This is all that can be said about him - he is, he works. <br><br>  But the fact that sometimes causes complaints is navigation - in most cases, and I, too, everything seems to be in perfect order and even better, and lying on a window sill, a smartphone can catch from five satellites, and the launch is very fast, and tests pass on "Hurray!".  But in some programs they say the connection can simply fall off - and the navigation program loses all the satellites and sense of direction at once.  But in my opinion it is more like a software problem than a defect in the equipment itself.  I did not notice this.  Yes, maybe I was just lucky. <br>  So by and large though - I practically do not use navigation, yet I am very glad that I have a GLONASS in my smartphone at the same time as a simple GPS - because two, this is more than one.  And the case he is different! <br><br>  I'm not greedy, I'm thrifty ... <br><br>  The same censure can cause photocamera.  Main, located behind.  The frontal me always and everywhere worries a little - it is there, no - it makes no difference to me, I don‚Äôt make myself censored, I don‚Äôt lead video chats. <br>  But a memory photo is sometimes a useful thing - is it not enough, what and where will you need to remember?  And this is where the time comes for the main camera, for 8 megapixels, which, according to the assurances of the developers of the smartphone, should ensure unsurpassed picture quality.  Must.  But not always or not at all provides.  In general, see for yourself the examples of pictures, in the afternoon everything is fine, in the evening it is not so good: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/028/39d/d1f/02839dd1ffc74313af3ba185aca9ad98.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cf6/ec9/b80/cf6ec9b801e74d4d916edc65afbc5454.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2c5/b58/2c6/2c5b582c6cc248c5b8fe27422bb79f1f.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e8d/fd9/fb9/e8dfd9fb90814992aa58168a77e8ef2f.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7a6/fc5/988/7a6fc5988f5c463f9f3d7043c8261168.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/738/29e/2b8/73829e2b850c4b03ba90f182c08a9cc8.jpg"><br><br>  So in the end we can say shortly - for a budget smartphone, which is the position of Highscreen Power Ice, it is not so bad.  And even you can safely say very good! <br>  He will find his real audience, at least among business people - for whom such characteristics as appearance and work time are important.  Youth or women?  Perhaps they will like the golden version.  Children or technologists equal to them - well, it is unlikely.  He has no special ‚Äúwow effects,‚Äù beeping buttons, or thermal cameras. <br><br>  It's just a good working smartphone. <br><br>  There is a worse model.  Much better?  Perhaps I didn‚Äôt look too thoroughly, but it seems there aren‚Äôt very many of them.  And if we take into account the criterion of the battery, then the competition will be made only by the same Highscreen products ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/371859/">https://habr.com/ru/post/371859/</a></p>
