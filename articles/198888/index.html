We cranked this thing about two years ago, and I must say, not only made our lives easier, but also increased the efficiency of working with clients. <br><br>  Every time when hiring new sales managers and project managers, we had to tell a lot about what customers are, about the features of working with a particular segment, etc. Since this information was not systematized, we often there were difficulties with its transfer and how its newcomers mastered it.  It happened that new employees found themselves in situations that could have been avoided if the guys had mastered all the nuances of working with this or that type of customers.  And on the contrary, sometimes they missed the possibilities of more successful development of relations with a client without using the correct approach to this group of clients. <br><br>  All this ultimately led us to the segmentation of our current customers.  We analyzed our current customer base and classified all customers into 4 large groups and briefly described the tactics of working with each segment. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Customer classification </h4>

Well versed in the market and professionally versed in internet marketing.  Very scrupulously evaluate the contractor for several parameters.  Most often - representatives of medium and large businesses working as marketing communications specialists or heads of advertising / marketing department.  First of all, the following parameters are important for such clients: experience of similar work, quality, time, and then prices (with the first 3 parameters).

As a rule, they make a deal quickly and pay quickly.  Often, they are already focused on working with a specific contractor, to whom there is a big credit of trust.  Mostly shallow understanding of the topic.  Few interfere with the work of the contractor.  Often, representatives of small and medium-sized businesses, in the status of directors or hands.  directions.

Try to already at the stage of developing the site to sell additional.  services (seo, contextual advertising, tech support). <br><br>  <b>"Newbie"</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b82/cb4/46d/b82cb446dfa95e69de9ed844a7f381b6.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Inexperienced entrepreneurs who are very sensitive to the cost of the project.  Are at the stage of creating a business, or are already working, have not previously ordered the site.  When choosing a contractor experiencing excessive loyalty (apparently due to lack of experience).  Often give the contractor at the mercy of questions on the development of design and those.  tasks.

Clearly organize the work process, intensively influence the client, speed up the work process.  You can make easier sales add.  services. <br><br>  <b>4. ‚ÄúCautious‚Äù</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/580/0d6/995/5800d6995b61e43c81adffeaf91b0e49.png" alt="image"><br><br>  As a rule, customers who have had negative experience with past contractors.  Most often, representatives of small and less often medium-sized businesses, at the level of directors and owners.  Sensitive to prices and warranties.  A high level of distrust towards potential contractors.  Long choose a contractor, often in doubt.  The project is often delayed.  Often can not clearly articulate goals and objectives.

Offer warranty. <br><br>  <b>Total</b> <br><br>  Of course, the majority of clients did not squeeze into such a rigid segmentation framework, more often there were mixes from different segments.  In this case, it was always possible to distinguish the predominant type.  Over time, we began to allocate subsegments, for example, ‚Äúbeginner-cautious,‚Äù etc. This more subtle segmentation allowed us to easily classify almost any client. <br><br>  After we created this client classification system, we conducted internal training for all employees who worked with clients and began to use them in their daily work.  It has become easier for us to betray information and train new employees.  Our sales team began to work better with the flow of incoming requests, eliminating "low-quality" potential customers. <br><br>  Employees have become more flexible and thinner to work with different customer segments, building a more competent sales tactic, which is based on a clear understanding of the characteristics of the segment.  The tactics of working with different segments has become more targeted, and ultimately, more effective. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/198888/">https://habr.com/ru/post/198888/</a></p>
