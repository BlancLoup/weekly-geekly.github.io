      Getting acquainted with the expectations of the authors of start-ups, there is a feeling that at the heart of their ideas about business are the patterned pictures of business series cliparts.  The very ones that adorn the sites of every kind of forex-zamanuh, with the indispensable images of triumphant businessmen and admiringly respectful investors. <br><br>  I am extremely skeptical about the value of ideas.  <b>Nobody buys ideas.</b> <br>  Firstly, the number of investors is extremely limited. <br>  Secondly, purchased ‚Äúideological‚Äù companies are obviously not so easily acquired.  The dotcom morocum has not yet completely dissipated, but the varnish is gradually starting to disappear from success stories and the role of investors in it.  Bought, or - patents, or - client base, or - a certain, immense size and quickly monetized (or capitalized) potential. <br>  The very idea - once uttered aloud - ceases to belong to its author. <br><br><h5>  <b>2. Surviving</b> </h5><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Even being already in the implementation stage, the idea is extremely vulnerable.  A certain moment comes when the project no longer fits on the knee, requires significant investments, and monetization is still far away.  Then it is easier for an investor to copy the idea, slightly modernize the functionality and take into account the mistakes of the predecessor - and, voila - a million is not just past you, but against you.  It will be invested in the promotion of a competing project. <br>  Once you have seen the realization of your ‚Äúidea for a million‚Äù, you can very likely assume that it is she, your idea, that is.  The described idea is like a germinated seed - the process is irreversible.  After all, we are from ushlyh investors, as is known, in just 7 handshakes. <br><br><h5>  <b>3. Returning to the sinful earth</b> </h5><br><br>  Reflecting in this way, we voluntarily refused to conquer the world with our "ideas for a million", and decided to just make money, not disdaining and much modest projects. <br><br>  A group of like-minded people out of five people, which included three IT specialists, a lawyer and an economist, united in a kind of investment company. <br>  The initial capital, formed as a result of the sale of real estate, auto and printing of the capsule by the partners, amounted to fifteen million rubles. <br><br>  The money was his, they were the only and last.  To them was attached, a huge size, a toad.  Therefore, no one went to learn from experience in Silicon Valley. <br><br>  We chose the Russian IT-sphere and Internet projects as the investment area. <br><br>  Finally, the idea took shape after a series of successful experiments.  So, in 2009, a proposal was received to assist in winning a tender for maintenance of accounting software.  As a result, the profitability of this project exceeded all expectations: after deducting taxes, the invested ruble brought 4 rubles of net profit.  And this is not counting the fact that as a result of the project implementation, we became owners of tested in practice, developments in automation of a very specific area of ‚Äã‚Äãaccounting. <br><br>  We created a company, attracted specialists - permanent and freelance, we have established a service. <br><br>  The person who passed the idea to us became our companion with a share of 30%.  In the process of creating a company, we agreed on the procedure for buying out the company's shares.  According to the forecast, we will go out of business in 3 years, leaving the partner with all the technical and methodological part of the project. <br><br>  In terms of Internet projects, we took part in bringing local networks of several cities, where the Internet is still very expensive, local versions of sites selling attributes of youth subcultures. <br>  We conducted local viral campaigns and organized angry speeches of the older generation on this subject.  The result of educational work among young people directed against us and carried out in all schools of the city was that even first-graders now flaunt in the goods promoted by us.  The youth is a protest electorate. <br>  This project brought 350% of the profits on the invested money.  True, he didn‚Äôt deliver much joy, since suppliers did not disdain to promote certain categories of goods that had become illegal since the beginning of 2010.  We left the project ahead of schedule, in the period of the most active growth of the business - with lost profit and invaluable practical experience of viral marketing. <br>  There were many very ‚Äúshort‚Äù projects built on the principle of ‚Äúbuy cheaper - sell more expensive‚Äù.  The partners, as a rule, were insiders of the buyer, often - not making decisions, but knowing the intricacies of tenders. <br><br>  These are not "million dollar" projects.  They are sickeningly banal.  But these are projects for solid "one hundred thousand." <br><br>  Now we are putting a lot of emphasis on online business.  For example, from one of the projects we received a 1C configuration, sharpened and run-in for a very specific manufacturing industry. <br>  With completely identical production processes in it, the associated business processes are unique for each enterprise.  It was accompanied by complete information on the production processes of the industry and possible ways to implement them.  And also - experience that allows you to speak the same language with the adepts of this industry. <br><br>  We plan to close the main functionality, put the full configuration in open access and try to earn money on implementations and customer support. <br><br>  For internet projects we have developed our own large SEO infrastructure. <br><br>  We are actively looking for and considering all projects that can bring good profits.  We minimize risks by taking only projects with guaranteed profits.  We do not work with offers of ‚Äúkickbacks‚Äù, however, we willingly accept offers on the terms of partnership, when a partner shares risks with us at every stage of the project. <br><br>  We became grown-up children, who still write letters to venture Grandfather Frost, however, they no longer build illusions about the origin of gifts under the tree. <br><br><h5>  <b>4. Just partners</b> </h5><br><br>  Most of the people with whom we are creating a new business have no business experience and are not willing to learn how to conduct business in the harsh Russian realities. <br>  When it‚Äôs not about a million dollars, it‚Äôs very easy to communicate with people.  Business within our projects is simple and transparent.  More often than not, the participation of our partners does not end with one idea.  They are building a business ‚Äúfor themselves‚Äù - we will leave the projects 3 years after their creation. <br><br>  By the way - many of the partners cherish their projects, the very ‚Äúfor a million‚Äù.  And they are waiting for those with the most money. <br><br><h5>  <b>5. Conclusion</b> </h5><br><br>  Hurry up to live.  "Million" ideas - this is a great fairy tale, take care of it from other people's ears. <br>  And - do not miss everyday modest opportunities. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/97468/">https://habr.com/ru/post/97468/</a></p>
