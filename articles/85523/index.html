      <i>‚ÄúFrom the creator of the legendary film epic‚Äú The Lord of the Rings ‚Äùand the monumental blockbuster‚Äú King Kong ‚ÄùPeter Jackson.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The studios managed not only to keep the plot secret, but also to ensure complete security of the film copies sent to premieres around the world.</i>  <i>It is safe to say that the ‚Äúpirate‚Äù of District No. 9 is not yet. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  But "Wallmart" <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2008/09/26/walmart-shutting-dow.html">sends letters to</a> happy music buyers, and asks them to immediately save these music to CDs.  Wallmart‚Äôs music department shifts to the sale of files that are not copy protected.  As part of this transition, the rights management server is planned to be disabled.  After that, it will be impossible to transfer the purchased files to another computer.  In addition, they will stop playing after reinstalling the operating system. <br><br>  And here - the saga in two parts about the purchase of legal programs from Adobe.  <a href="http://provitiligo.livejournal.com/9365.html%3Fstyle%3Dmine">Theoretical part one</a> : <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúApart from the Russian developers, the two largest companies are Microsoft‚Äôs and Adobe‚Äôs largest and most ardent fighters for justice in our market.</i>  <i>Both of them periodically organize raids, sending ‚Äúletters of happiness‚Äù to all companies in a row.</i>  <i>For example, Adobe stupidly sent a letter to all major design studios, in which it was written, they say, we have information that you have an illegal software of our company, and if you want to contact us to get your portion of pizdyuly, and at the same time discuss the conditions of mutually beneficial "whitening".</i>  <i>Those who did not react to this opus in any way, after some time they called and asked, ‚ÄúWell, haven't you thought up yet?‚Äù, And if this did not help, then they transferred the matter to the appropriate services.</i>  <i>The latter, without any warnings and compromises, satisfied the violators right through their pants.</i>  <i>Those who are smarter and poorer, went for various tricks - they downloaded trial versions and to infinity dropped the counter, installed portable versions on flash drives and did other nonsense.</i>  <i>It would seem that with such a serious approach, both companies, taking into account our realities, should create all the conditions for the easy transition of Russians to legal software.</i>  <i>In fact, the opposite is true.</i>  <i>Small programs like media players, archivers, editors, etc. can be bought, which is called ‚Äúwithout leaving the cash register‚Äù - put a credit card in, got a code for ‚Äúsoap‚Äù, Injoy.</i>  <i>Problems start when you try to buy the same office or photoshop. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  ... and a <a href="http://provitiligo.livejournal.com/9800.html%3Fstyle%3Dmine">practical second</a> : <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúSomewhere in the end of September I bought Photoshop Elements 7.0, and literally in 2-3 weeks the G8 came out.</i>  <i>There are a number of very significant changes in it, and renewal has become my completely natural desire.</i>  <i>In civilized countries, as usual, everything is simple with this: I entered a credit card on the site, I received an update package, Injoy.</i>  <i>In Russia, you need to contact a reseller and request a service pack from him.</i>  <i>At the same time, as it turned out, not every reseller has these packages, and those who want to upgrade will still have to run and search for the right seller.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>This scheme did not suit me at all, and the reseller, from whom I bought the ‚Äúseven‚Äù, took my phone and promised to find out everything and call back, disappeared safely.</i>  <i>With a request to help resolve this issue, I called the official representative where I was tied to the licensing department.</i>  <i>There, the young man began to issue standard phrases like ‚Äúyou can contact one of the resellers‚Äù with a full pofigism, and none of my attempts to explain that I‚Äôm calling for a reason and hoping to get help did not help.</i>  <i>The conversation ended with the phrase ‚Äúwell, download it in torrents,‚Äù after which the young man abruptly said goodbye and hung up. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  But the <a href="http://silverwind3000.livejournal.com/83122.html%3Fstyle%3Dmine">suffering customer legal DVD-ROM</a> : <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúI‚Äôm walking down the street yesterday, looking at a DVD store selling on the occasion of Children's Day - cartoons for 50 rubles each.</i>  <i>Bought two.</i>  <i>I open one this morning - on the cover of ‚ÄúWell, wait a minute!‚Äù 19th and 20th issues.</i>  <i>I thought that there is a classic of the genre, plus new releases.</i>  <i>It turned out that only two new cartoons.</i>  <i>On a DVD disk - 20 minutes of the image.</i>  <i>Plus some sort of quiz and stuff like a bonus.</i>  <i>I read the disc carefully - it is definitely not written anywhere that there is a series from 1 to 18 there too.</i>  <i>What can I say?</i>  <i>What not figs chasing cheap?</i>  <i>What would I even dream of in a nightmare that you can buy ‚ÄúWell, wait a minute!‚Äù - like this by the piece?</i>  <i>For 25 rubles per series?</i>  <i>No, I do not mind the fifty dollars - it is a pity that I stepped on the same rake again - I bought a license disk.</i>  <i>It is my fault, not figs to buy any rubbish in the store.</i>  <i>You just need to download from the grid and do not bathe. "</i> <br><br>  And here is the <a href="http://forum.ixbt.com/topic.cgi%3Fid%3D15:58219-15">experience of communication with the support of Microsoft</a> : <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúI decided to ask a question here - is it possible to use Win XP Home OEM in automatic machines for receiving payments.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>I wrote an off letter to the Center for Information and Technical Support in the name of V.O. Chikarevskaya.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The problem was that I needed an official response on the forms to show to the verifiers.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>After 14 days and many calls I received a fax answer on the form, which said that this version of the OS can be used in organizations, but that if it is a computer club, then it is necessary to sign the rent agriment.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The artist is Vitvitsky Anton.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>When I called him and said that he did not answer my question, and that his answer was an answer, he replied that the Information and Technical Support Center could not answer my question and that I should contact the MS office in Russia.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The call to the representative office began with the fact that I did not want to be connected with anyone, and I wanted to give the name of the employee.</i>  <i>Which I could not know and which Vitlitsky refused to tell me, citing ignorance.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Raza since the fifth call center employee took pity and connected with such a character as Alexander Fear, Lawyer for licensed protection.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>(nda ..)</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Fear accepted the problem, found all the letters and answers, and promised to respond.</i>  <i>He replied verbally that using Win XP Home OEM is possible with a renting agriment, but that it isn‚Äôt sold, but SP2 is sold, which the rental doesn‚Äôt cover and, therefore, use is prohibited, according to paragraph 5 of the EULA.</i>  <i>To my insistent requests to clarify in a written form, where p. 5 of the EULA is violated, he took time-outs and after their expiration took them again.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>...</i> <i><br></i>  <i>As a result of all this correspondence: we received a response on the form to prohibit the use of this version of the OS with reference to paragraph 5 of the EULA.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>We have not received an explanation of exactly how this paragraph is violated.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>And there is an opinion that this paper is a reason for court proceedings with the IJ to impose a more expensive product.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>All communication lasted more than 9 weeks.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>If someone tells you that MS is a ‚Äúsolution for business‚Äù, do not believe it.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>According to the results, it was decided to rework the software for Linux. "</i> <br><br>  ... but even when you, having overcome vendors and technical support, legalized with programs from this remarkable corporation, their installation can turn into a <a href="http://alexkuklin.livejournal.com/515532.html">real quest</a> .  Quest I do not quote, it is long. <br><br>  So, looking at the bulls around torrents.ru, I think that piracy is the only remedy for the shabby ‚Äúrightholders‚Äù.  Since the law on the protection of consumer rights to "intellectual property", unfortunately, does not apply. <br>  And while Avtodesk and Odinos are justifying themselves before the outraged public, assuring her of their innocence to the closure of the tracker, not everything is lost in Russia, I‚Äôm scribbling ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/85523/">https://habr.com/ru/post/85523/</a></p>
