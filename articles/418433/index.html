First cycle quest for programmers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Last year, the Veeam Geek Hub community appeared in the Prague office of Veeam Software, uniting Russian-speaking developers from various companies who are interested in new technologies and are ready to share their experience at the Veeam site and just spend time in the company of pleasant people just like you. <br><br>  Within the community in Prague, several meetings have already been held, and today we are announcing the next event based on Veeam Geek Hub, but already in St. Petersburg: On August 4, the first IT Bike Quest in St. Petersburg will be held. <br><br>  Under the cut, we tell you why you definitely need to register for it right now.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zd/uw/3p/zduw3pyrouaquytnrjwqqtnzjq0.png" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The quest market in reality is quite extensive and today it is practically not difficult to find entertainment for every taste.  However, almost all of them involve participation in small teams, all members of which are linked by family or friendship. <br><br>  We decided to do a quest in reality, which will bring together developers and people close to the topic of IT. <br><br><h4>  Why IT? </h4><br>  It is known that networking and teamwork on something unusual expands the horizons and provides opportunities for development.  For developers, different formats for leisure activities (entertainment, intellectual, sports) were invented, and the new Veeam IT Bike Quest, as we expect, will become a platform for communication of people with similar interests, which combines all these formats at once. <br><br><h4>  Why Bike? </h4><br>  It so happened that we have a special attitude to cycling in the company, and at the global level: Veeam has its own cycling club, where already 200+ colleagues from various offices around the world actively carry out weekend trips, compete with each other in kilometers, speed and colorful routes. <br><br>  In general, if we do events for Peter programmers, then those that we like ourselves - so we decided that this time we will make a cycle quest.  And today we offer you to take part in it. <br><br>  We organized the quest so that all its locations are at a distance from each other, which is comfortable to overcome on a bicycle. <br><br><h4>  When?  Where?  What awaits you? </h4><br>  Quest will be held on August 4 (Saturday), from 14.00 to 18.00.  All locations, including the start and finish, are located in the very center of St. Petersburg. <br><br>  Before the start of the quest, we will divide you into teams.  Teams will need to go through (read - ‚Äúpass‚Äù) 9 points, each of them has tasks for logic, opening locks, decoding the code, and managing gadgets (drones, gyroscopes).  The winning team will open a safe filled with prizes! <br><br><h4>  How to participate? </h4><br>  The number of places for participation is limited - they are supposed to be only 50. To register for the quest, you need: <br><br>  1. Fill out the registration form <a href="https://ru.surveymonkey.com/r/ITBikeQuestHabr">at the link</a> <br>  2. Decrypt 5 code fragments in C #. <br><br>  We advise you to do this as soon as possible in order to be among the first 50 participants who correctly decoded the code.  Registration closes at the end of the day on August 1st.  After the correct decoding of the code, you will receive an email with the details of the quest and a confirmation form. <br>  Participation is free! <br><br>  So, if you want to have a great time in the company of like-minded people, register <a href="https://ru.surveymonkey.com/r/ITBikeQuestHabr">here</a> . <br><br>  We are waiting for you on August 4 in St. Petersburg on IT Bike Quest! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/418433/">https://habr.com/ru/post/418433/</a></p>
