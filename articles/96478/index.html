      Timothy Post - the ideological inspirer of BarCamp in Krasnodar, launched a welcoming speech (which has already become a tradition), and the mini-conference began. <br><img src="http://www.livekuban.ru/files/attachs/img/2010/06/dsc_2079_jpg_40088.jpg"><br><br>  After a brief information digest, which the geeks themselves decided to introduce into the program on the first minibar, the main part followed: the launch-up presentation. <br><br><img src="http://www.livekuban.ru/files/paper/DSC_2228-2.jpg"><br><br>  The first were Vlad Burlak and Mikhail Rudenko with their project BlindSynth.  They presented a system for learning to write music for people with vision problems.  Despite the fact that this project was repeatedly approved by the jury of various competitions, the opinions of the audience differed in estimates.  Krasnodar geeks made a remark to the developers that, being carried away by the technical side of the project, they forgot about the blind themselves.  An innovative device needs to be tested on the declared audience - is it convenient, will it be useful, and can it really teach people with visual problems even from scratch to music?  After MiniBar, Mikhail Rudenko tweeted: ‚ÄúThanks to everyone.  Your advice will help us further develop BlindSynth. ‚Äù <br><br>  The second start-up is an innovative development in the field of outdoor advertising called ‚ÄúPolytron‚Äù.  It was presented by the developer Dmitry Pershin.  The essence of the project is that 3x6 m advertising banners can contain not three modules, as now, but much more: 6, 9, 12, etc.  - This is provided by special roller mechanisms.  Such a banner, according to Dmitry, will allow ‚Äúunloading‚Äù the city from the abundance of advertising constructions littering its appearance.  However, this start-up was not a success among Krasnodar geeks.  Dmitry was attacked with questions: how competitive is this development, and why take a step back - to mechanized devices, when the whole world switches to digital technologies.  However, Dmitry did not bother to ask questions - it was felt that the developer was confident in his project. <br><br><img src="http://www.livekuban.ru/files/attachs/img/2010/06/dsc_2291_jpg_96766.jpg"><br><br>  The discussion continued during a half-hour break, which was announced by the MiniBar host Nikita Eremin after the presentation of the projects. <br>  Break is an important part of the MiniBar.  During this time, participants can communicate with each other in an informal setting, exchange business cards, talk on professional topics. <br>  The organizers also prepared a small buffet for the participants. <br><br>  After the break, the most interesting guest of MiniBar No. 2, Amsterdamian Jura Mulders, spoke.  He introduced himself as a web designer and told the Krasnodar geeks about the charitable Internet project <a href="http://www.clicks4bricks.org/">www.clicks4bricks.org</a> , in the development of which he participated. <br><img src="http://www.livekuban.ru/files/attachs/img/2010/06/dsc_2340_jpg_15291.jpg"><br><br>  The project website contains photos of 25 families from San Salvador who live in slums below the poverty line.  Every visitor to the site can click once a day ‚Äúfor‚Äù the family he chose, and the advertiser, whose banner is placed next to the family photos, will transfer 25 euro cents to build a new house. <br>  Yura speaks Russian quite well, and his story has received approval.  The <a href="http://bit.ly/d0astl">photos of Boris Maltsev</a> taken during this presentation were especially interesting and lively :) <br><br><img src="http://www.livekuban.ru/files/attachs/img/2010/06/dsc_2387_jpg_16402.jpg"><br><br>  The final part of the MiniBar ‚Ññ2 was the discussion of the large PhotoCamp conference in Krasnodar.  The result of this discussion is the decision to hold (for a start) a themed minibar dedicated to photography, and after it, PhotoCamp. <br>  Judging by the reviews, the majority of MiniBar participants were pleased with the event.  Thanks to BarCamp, Krasnodar‚Äôs online community continues to evolve and expand. <br>  However, the organizers received from the geeks several useful suggestions for improving the mini-conference.  For example, to make the list of participants open, or better approach the selection of presentations of start-ups. <br>  All comments will be taken into account. <br><br>  The next minibar is scheduled for July 2010. <br><br>  <i>Report author - Olesya Ardasheva (@liska_jour)</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/96478/">https://habr.com/ru/post/96478/</a></p>
