      <i>How can you use this phenomenon for your own purposes:</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  1. Reviews and reviews </h5><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7d7/bde/0bd/7d7bde0bde644b219acfd3dee54f41c6.png" alt="image"></div><br><br>  Reviews and reviews are the most powerful way to use social proof in an online store.  In addition to the obvious information submitted in the recall, the visitor concludes that this product has already been bought by others, and it may be worthwhile to buy it. <br><br>  In addition, reviews have a "natural" content.  They do not look like licked SEO texts, product descriptions and other texts on the site.  If you decide to use copywriters to fill reviews for their products, do not scold them for minor grammatical and punctuation errors, this will give reviews reviews. <br><br>  The controversial question remains what to do with negative and sharply negative reviews.  Deleting reviews is not the best idea at all, an impressionable visitor, without finding a review on the site, can raise a good scandal using social networks and other methods that are available to everyone today.  Some devastating product reviews should be a signal that you should think about stopping the sale of this product, but each such review is worth a detailed review.  Perhaps the client got a defective product, a competent approach to the policy of return and compensation will make it your most loyal customer.  After successfully solving the problem, do not forget to ask him to leave feedback about it. <br><br>  Reviews indicating minor product flaws will add credibility to all reviews. <br><br>  Never create a separate page for reviews, they should be visible directly next to the product.  If you have a narrow range of products or services, broadcasting reviews to the main page will be an excellent solution, they will immediately attract the attention of users and motivate you to go to the product (service) page in order to become better acquainted with it. <br><br><h5>  2. Approval from authorities or ‚ÄúDental Association Recommends‚Äù </h5><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/495/48c/e80/49548ce807954e0da2ed5c04bdbecb1d.png" alt="image"></div><br><br>  This technique is based on the use of "expert" opinion or the use of quotes by famous people who directly relate to the service (product) being sold.  The more famous and influential a person is, the stronger is social proof. <br><br>  If your business does not deserve a compliment from a well-known person, respected by your audience, try to achieve this.  Pay attention to him, provide top-quality services or make a gift, become a sponsor of his event, etc. <br><br>  In addition, you can place a photo of an ‚Äúexpert‚Äù on the page with the words ‚Äúresearch showed ...‚Äù, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22869334">studies</a> have shown that it works. <br><br><h5>  3. Number of subscribers </h5><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/633/64a/a26/63364aa261ae4de585e2d5b8bda0bc88.png" alt="image"></div><br><br>  It is not only about sending out, the phrase ‚Äú100,000,000 people took advantage of our services‚Äù has a magical effect.  For example, its implementation in the registration form orbitmedia.com increased the number of completed registrations 14 times. <br><br><h5>  4. Social sharing buttons </h5><br>  The variation of the previous paragraph.  Add to the page the number of quoting entries in social networks.  If we are talking about an online store, then why not give the buyer the opportunity to boast a new thing, in addition, you can provide a discount for quoting your page, firstly it will be a great "natural" advertising, and secondly, the numbers that run on the citation counters, will become your reliable assistants in the use of social proof. <br><br>  But remember, it is better not to have any proof than bad.  If the counters are holes of zeros, it is better not to put them. <br><br><h5>  5. Social network widgets </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a8d/430/908/a8d4309085564d99b8e5417d1312725b.PNG" alt="image" align="right"><br>  If you are not already engaged in social marketing, perhaps it‚Äôs time to start.  Using the widget with the members of your group on VK or Facebook will give you a few positive points: <br><br>  1. It looks like your product (service) has a group of fans; <br><br>  2. Avatars with photos make them individual, which inspires confidence; <br><br>  3. Social proof starts working for you. <br><br>  Do not use these widgets if your group is dead.  Going to it can discourage the visitor from all desire to cooperate with you. <br><br><h5>  6. ‚ÄúWe are in the media‚Äù </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cd1/457/1ec/cd14571ec45143aba53376c362c2d909.PNG" alt="image" align="right"><br>  If you have ever been written about in the media, social proof is already on your side, of course, if you are not completely defeated in the article.  Place on the main page logos and links to respected media that have mentioned about you in their publications. <br><br><h5>  7. Cases of trust </h5><br>  This method is not so common in domestic practice as in foreign.  A foreign online store can participate in a dozen communities and associations that ‚Äúguarantee and ensure reliability and competence, high quality, excellent service, etc.‚Äù <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fcc/15a/f5e/fcc15af5e5b94f3b98457587a803d5d9.png" alt="image"></div><br><br>  Placing the symbolism of such associations in the basement of each page will make you part of a large team and demonstrate your high level to your visitors. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/231793/">https://habr.com/ru/post/231793/</a></p>
