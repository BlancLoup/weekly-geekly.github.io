In this issue: <br><ul><li>  Mash-up is a setup! <br>  Tags - frankly about intimate. <br>  Development of the idea of ‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúDistributed Authoring Mash-up‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Podstava </h2><br>  The second section in my original topic ("Number. Search for mash-up against the search for interesting authors.") Is fundamentally wrong, because  relies on false premises.  For some reason, I decided that a hellish mixture of what the author writes and what the author reads will be ‚Äúhigh-quality‚Äù and interesting for his readers.  That's nonsense! <br><blockquote>  When would you know from what litter <br>  Verses grow, not knowing shame <a href="http://www.litera.ru/stixiya/authors/axmatova/all.html">...</a> </blockquote>  Information about what a <u>particular person is interested in (what is reading)</u> has nothing to do with <u>what this person writes</u> .  Such information may be of interest for special services, for marketing research, for psychologists, and for some categories of psychos (fans).  Point.  This information is for those who <b>explore</b> me!  And she has no other value!  Think about it, this thought from those that seem obvious - after they sound, of course. <br><br><h2>  A bit of exhibitionism </h2><br>  Different people choose different tags for the same content.  In fact, tags are some tags that make sense <u>only for you</u> .  Using these tags will make it easier to find this content later.  <u>To you, but not to other people!</u>  Looking at someone else‚Äôs tag cloud you can get some idea about this person, but not about the content that is hidden behind these tags. <br><br>  Thus, the tags are not bad as your personal mechanism for grouping content, and to expose these, I‚Äôm not afraid of this word, intimate details for all to see is not enough.  As a result, all these little-useful (for others) ‚Äúclouds‚Äù are obtained.

    <h2>  Idea correction </h2><br>  If the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãpublishing the materials that I have selected for myself is removed from my original idea, the authors remain the only source of information.  Which is quite difficult to find, who write little, etc.  etc.  etc.  - Further, all of the original text.  But there is a solution!  The fact is that in addition to the author (who usually reads strange and little-interesting things from my point of view), there are readers.  Readers who read and discuss this article with me.  I have much more common interests with them - at least all of us were interested in this article, this topic, and this author.  :) <br><br>  And if these readers, in addition to discussing the article in the comments, add to a separate section under the article links to other <b>author</b> articles, which, from their point of view, are related to this article, you will get a very valuable (for readers!) Section " <b>related articles</b> " ! <br><br>  As a result, all content is divided into two categories: <b>author</b> (article) and <b>reader</b> (discussion and links to related articles).  Moreover, reader's content is moderated, and there may be several versions of this content (imagine something like tabs / bookmarks under the article, and each of these tabs has its own discussion of this article, with its moderator and its related related articles section - and you can always click ‚Äúnew discussion‚Äù button, creating a new bookmark, where you will be a moderator, if the moderation moderation of existing discussions does not suit you). <br><br>  Articles will attract certain categories of readers (who are interested in the topic and who find the article interesting); moderation will cut off readers who cannot / do not want to adequately discuss the article.  As a result, ‚Äúyour circle‚Äù will be formed, people who are interested in communicating with each other on this topic, and they will form a list of other interesting articles on this topic - interesting for this particular ‚Äúcircle‚Äù of people.  In those articles, it will be possible to give reciprocal links, and you will get a stupid "circle of articles" formed by the <b>readers of</b> these articles.  Moreover, there will be many such circles, depending on the level of readers (supported by discussion moderators). <br><br><h4>  Structuring articles </h4><br>  A hierarchical catalog is a much more natural way of organizing articles than tags or adding time (blogs).  The author will create a convenient hierarchical structure for him, and post articles in it.  And readers will be able to ‚Äúsubscribe‚Äù both to individual articles (to receive updates on comments and related articles), and to entire sections in the author‚Äôs structure (with subsections). <br><br>  As for tags, they can be used as a personal tool.  Found an interesting article - assigned her some tags.  Nobody sees these tags except for you, they can be stored locally on your computer.  (By the way, for sure there are already such implementations for the favorites.) <br><br><h4>  miscellanea </h4><br>  Group moderation, in my opinion, is not necessary - the multipolarity of opinions is guaranteed by the ability to create parallel discussions with other moderators. <br><br>  The protection of advertising banners that an author can insert into his articles ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/web_2_0/32368.html">hotly discussed</a> in the previous topic) is generally not worth it here - all the article is initially taken from the author himself, and he completely controls the content given to readers. <br><br>  <b>PS The idea is slowly emerging, taking shape, increasing meat on the bones ... :)</b> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/17477/">https://habr.com/ru/post/17477/</a></p>
