  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ulefone U7 - thin phablet</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today, not only the size and weight of the device, but also versatility rule the mobile device.  Perhaps the last parameter is even more significant than the first two, because most devices (within the same price category) now have similar data both in appearance and in performance, but their abilities are a decisive factor.  In connection with this, devices have appeared that are a ‚Äúmix‚Äù of the phone and tablet - fablets.  One of the representatives is uleFone U7. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/209/22b/3b8/20922b3b825b994d76a6b0cd42502b77.jpg"><br><br>  In general, the term "phablet" is relatively new, in fact it is not surprising, because the devices that are so called, appeared not so long ago.  As I wrote earlier, the phablet is a hybrid of a phone and a tablet, sometimes very strange, but generally comfortable and versatile.  A distinctive feature of such devices is a fairly large size (5 or 7 inches), as well as the presence of a stylus.  However, the last item is optional. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="ff9c00">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS</font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fe1/2cf/627/fe12cf627631c626104bcf788ffc6644.png" alt="image">  <b>Screen:</b> 7 ", 1920 x 1200 px, FullHD, LTPS <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/806/871/aac/806871aac785f1ac7a45fe2360d5ef7a.png" alt="image">  <b>Processor:</b> MT6592 (Cortex-A7, 1.7 GHz, 8 cores) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cf7/d69/613/cf7d6961340b5b16fa821567a8cdb089.png" alt="image">  <b>Video accelerator:</b> Mali 450-MP 700MHz <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7ed/145/aaa/7ed145aaabcfa9106c6be7a26f087b92.png" alt="image">  <b>Operating system:</b> Android 4.4.2 (KitKat) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/08f/b11/4cf/08fb114cf05af12329a682c7d179d012.png" alt="image">  <b>RAM:</b> 2 GB <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/487/aaf/2c0/487aaf2c012384e1cf135a561ba6a5f0.png" alt="image">  <b>User memory:</b> 16 GB + microSD slot <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cb8/0be/398/cb80be398f5ff56284fa2b3191102593.png" alt="image">  <b>Camera:</b> 13 MP rear, 2 MP front <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/384/f20/77c/384f2077c76f50d971aa0fe534b5ca3e.png" alt="image">  <b>Connectivity:</b> GSM / GPRS / EDGE + UMTS / HSPA + <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cce/212/125/cce21212518144071cb410c070f452dc.png" alt="image">  <b>Optional:</b> GPS, A-GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, OTG, accelerometer, gyroscope, compass, light sensor and distance <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1f0/8d9/6c5/1f08d96c5889f650144a0d8e30a2b5bc.png" alt="image">  <b>Battery:</b> 3500 mAh <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0d6/598/1a8/0d65981a80a55a05019aba9215d64193.png" alt="image">  <b>Dimensions:</b> 105.4x186.1x8.5 mm <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b2f/bfb/235/b2fbfb235eb524cec4c6508c5931bc2b.png" alt="image">  <b>Weight:</b> 223 grams <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8ff/846/60d/8ff84660d5cb791a7c7859d2127051b6.png" alt="image">  <b>Price:</b> $ 209 (~ 7 300 rubles)

    <h2>  <font color="E97784">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">PACKING AND COMPLETE SET</font> </h2><br>  uleFone U7 comes in a small white cardboard box which has a glossy finish.  The front face shows the device itself around which, like a pencil, notes, sheets of paper and so on are drawn.  In the upper right corner is the logo of the manufacturer.  Also, the manufacturer carefully informed us that this device is a phablet and that 2 SIM cards and 3G are supported. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/93e/4af/c77/93e4afc779a81ea9b914ac3b8c615d10.jpg"><br><br>  On the back side there is information about what the phablet is and how great it is, some technical characteristics of the device, as well as its information about the available colors of the back cover. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c30/52d/3e9/c3052d3e9cf32912bd866ae07fd35a93.jpg"><br><br>  This package has a small "catch" in the form of a magnetic clasp, which makes it somewhat richer.  But it‚Äôs not a fact that the contents are of the same high quality and beautiful, isn‚Äôt it?  But everything is in order here.  The manufacturer clearly took care of its potential consumers, so the device is wrapped inside a box in a bag and placed in a foam frame, which protects the device from mechanical damage. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/136/d98/8a0/136d988a0fb1475bf0f55716596ccacd.jpg"><br><br>  The package includes a protective film, user manual, warranty card, headphones, a fairly long USB cable, a charger and a convenient folding stand for the tablet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8ae/1d7/6d4/8ae1d76d45f5e2b9ec559beb8f6ab5a0.jpg"><br><br>  The manufacturer pleased us with a long USB-cable and a special stand on the phablet, but somewhat upset by the headphones.  They work poorly at low frequencies and wheeze a little, so that they don‚Äôt like music lovers. <br><br><h2>  <font color="ffd800">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">DESIGN, DIMENSIONS, CONTROL ELEMENTS</font> </h2><br>  Already in the box, it is clear that the manufacturer has tuned in to make the design as attractive as possible, therefore, taking the device out of the box, I was not surprised by its standard and strict, but nice looking design.  I got a review on the device in white design, but there are still in black, pink, green, yellow and orange colors.  In front of the U7 is a 7-inch LTPS display with a resolution of 1920x1200 pixels.  On the sides of it are thin frames, which makes it attractive, makes the phablet more compact, and the display is visually larger.  The dimensions of the device are relatively small 105.4x186.1x8.5 mm and the weight is only 223 grams. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6d6/8d9/bdf/6d68d9bdf5080b940700aac5737e7bbc.jpg"><br><br>  Above is a speaker, front camera with a resolution of 2 MP and two sensors: lighting and proximity.  The last sensor is responsible for ensuring that during a conversation you do not accidentally press the touchscreen with your cheek, which is very important for this device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1ef/97b/c94/1ef97bc9408cb9b5d8e3f238aa424dea.jpg"><br><br>  Below are the controls, in fact, the menu buttons, back and home, however, they are made in a somewhat unusual design for Android devices.  Only there is one drawback - there are no LEDs under them.  Therefore, it is necessary to press from memory. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b35/ed7/9c7/b35ed79c77fcb61a56499fe1b9dc4688.jpg"><br><br>  Also located below the port for microUSB and microphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/76a/d64/a8e/76ad64a8e29320879bc8a7f096703834.jpg"><br><br>  On top there is a 3.5 mm headphone jack. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2e5/91a/c35/2e591ac35fa0f7adc721d2f6eec31c3a.jpg"><br><br>  On the left side is the volume button. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/031/432/d0f/031432d0f12df154577eee5b1f33a17a.jpg"><br><br>  On the right side on / off / lock button. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/50a/146/0c6/50a1460c65c164b154c7fc59aea742cd.jpg"><br><br>  On the back side of the device on top is the main camera with a resolution of 13 MP with autofocus, LED flash and the manufacturer's logo. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/353/90e/8f0/35390e8f0ae4fdbfec9007eedd481664.jpg"><br><br>  Below is the perforation under the speakers.  By the way, the sound of the speakers is quite loud and clear. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f0f/693/29b/f0f69329bb809903715b53b94a1e2d09.jpg"><br><br>  The back cover itself is made of white matte plastic, but as I said before, its color may be different.  Due to the material of the cover, the surface is quite marking, but it is also easily wiped. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9a7/af0/fb2/9a7af0fb206a7f2b772cd04c77b4e56e.jpg"><br><br>  Now we have an autopsy.  No, no, we will not cut the phablet, but simply open the back cover and see what is there. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/db4/2a7/4f3/db42a74f3ac72ba22d96344d218f3531.jpg"><br><br>  And there we have a large 3500 mAh battery, all boards are covered with plastic, attached to small screws. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2d9/723/d57/2d9723d575ba344a50bdb4ac7326d829.jpg"><br><br>  Just above the battery ports are hidden under two SIM-cards, one of which is of standard size, and the other is small.  There is also a port under the microSD.  Why the manufacturer dumped everything in one pile is not clear, because there is enough space in the device and it was possible to place the slots more comfortably. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/572/6b3/d81/5726b3d81da3ad901a5d8beedbaba33c.jpg"><br><br>  In general, the form factor of this device is very good.  The buttons are conveniently located, while charging the cord does not interfere with the use of the phablet, and, despite its size, the device sits in the hands very well.  However, during the conversation, the interlocutor periodically asks to repeat what has been said, because the device is quite large and the microphone is far away from the mouth. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f1c/d00/f34/f1cd00f344a8331b6977e1d1853e647a.jpg"><br><br>  As for the assembly, there are no complaints, everything is assembled with high quality, there are no creaks and no backlashes. <br><br><h2>  <font color="00a8ff">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">DISPLAY</font> </h2><br>  This device is equipped with a FullHD display with a resolution of 1920x1200 pixels.  The display is simply excellent: very clear, natural colors, brightness is gorgeous, even in sunny weather the image on the display is clearly visible and it supports 10 touches. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/77f/1c2/38c/77f1c238c4cfde2ae08813fdc00a9918.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, there is an auto-adjusting function of the screen brightness for lighting, but there is a joint: the brightness does not adjust adequately to the lighting, especially when switching from shadow to sun, so this function in my opinion is better not to use. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/083/e5e/68d/083e5e68da030ed513fc0b23f2c2ef27.jpg"><br><br>  Viewing angles are also good, even though the colors are slightly faded. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0e0/08a/185/0e008a185302414e93cf660b56eab4ae.jpg"><br><br>  As I said, the display was excellent, especially for the state employees.  I would even say that not many top devices can boast of such. <br><br><h2>  <font color="ff0000">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">CAMERAS</font> </h2><br>  U7 is equipped with 2 cameras: front-facing resolution of 2 MP and rear resolution of 13 MP.  The pictures are of high quality, the color rendition is not bad, but, in my opinion, the white balance suffers.  Here is a photo from the front camera. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1bb/63a/99a/1bb63a99abbec11dfed0fe4f306d3d7d.jpg"><br><br>  But the photo from the main one. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c27/2b0/ae4/c272b0ae428a000fa34f3d8e50c0e9d4.jpg"><br><br>  There is some graininess in the photo from the front camera, but this is not surprising, after all, the device is positioned as a state employee, but for the Skype camera is quite enough.  The main camera is good, but could be better.  She suffers white balance, so the image is somewhat pale and the colors are not so saturated. <br><br><h2>  <font color="00ffff">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">SOFTWARE PLATFORM</font> </h2><br>  Android 4.4.2 KitKat is installed on the U7.  The only alteration is a translucent background in the menu, the rest is all standard.  The phablet has several applications from Google plus Skype and Twitter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/15a/30c/a30/15a30ca30edfb80f15c895a1ca205888.jpg"><br><br>  You can also select a file manager that will help not to litter the memory of the phone, a simple movie studio, and a flashlight. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c6e/570/c65/c6e570c65389fb7e6710d2748831237b.jpg"><br><br>  Well, what got phablet from a smartphone, so this is a dialer and a program for sending messages. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e19/d90/0c7/e19d900c79835440b6749d2c9d9a94aa.png"><br><br>  The operating system is stable, without brakes and hangs.  This also contributes to iron, but more on that later. <br><br><h2>  <font color="9000ff">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">PRODUCTIVITY</font> </h2><br>  The performance of this device is very good, but in general it is not surprising.  The phablet is equipped with an 8-core MediaTek MTK6592 processor with a frequency of 1.7 MHz, 2 gigabytes of RAM, as well as a Mali-450 MP4 video processor.  It will seem to many that this is not enough, but I assure you that iron copes with its task very well.  Confirmation to that tests. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4e9/0aa/e57/4e90aae573d3159081f478ca417360a1.jpg"><br><br>  There are no problems in working with graphics either.  This contributes to a separate video chip.  Not to say that the results are staggering, but the device proved to be very, very worthy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/555/e89/8a9/555e898a987a0ece4c14ca183c71fa8c.jpg"><br><br>  In games, the device behaves decently.  Dynamic, beautiful graphics do not cause brakes and hangs, and the U7 is not very hot. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/551/c04/f77/551c04f77598c4fcae0e478a578f5497.jpg"><br><br>  Well, here the screenshot speaks for itself.  Dynamic changing environment, plus the work of the gyroscope.  Phablet began to warm up a little. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cab/6a1/a17/cab6a1a17979ee6ecfd123c7f9f44065.jpg"><br><br>  And there are a lot of bright colors and a bunch of incoming zombies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/394/c13/e97/394c13e97666ac85848359829d18391b.jpg"><br><br>  In general, the impressions of the device only positive, a little heated, but it is not critical. <br><br><h2>  <font color="EA5F39">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">WIRELESS NETWORKS</font> </h2><br>  They are here a fan.  There is GPS support. There is also support for A-GPS, there is support for Bluetooth 4.0, and, as was said before, the phablet got the opportunity to make calls from the smartphone.  Our eyes will fall on Wi-Fi, GPS and mobile networks.  Let's start with Wi-Fi.  Everything is great here.  Everything works fine, the module finds a lot of networks, the signal is stable.  Here is the picture that is observed next to the router. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c6a/dd6/570/c6add6570eb737c58d6798cba33fef47.jpg"><br><br>  But through a couple of walls. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3ac/105/9c4/3ac1059c4ff4ed3dec44f00fa4b72ee6.jpg"><br><br>  Now GPS and mobile networks.  Like the Wi-Fi module, the GPS module does its job very well.  As I already said, the device supports work with two SIM-cards. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ef0/f9a/a4c/ef0f9aa4c174f820fe5b8dd0b30df58d.jpg"><br><br>  Dialer and program for writing messages are standard.  Everything works stably, without interruption. <br><br><h2>  <font color="1C1C1C">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">BATTERY, CHARGING, TIME OF WORK</font> </h2><br>  On this device is quite capacious lithium-polymer battery at 3500 mAh.  Despite the large FullHD display, the battery lasts for about 1.5 days, if you constantly play, then it‚Äôs enough for a day. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b33/ca6/1b8/b33ca61b8b4187ec9bad354f817ee0b2.png"><br><br><h2>  <font color="6BB501">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">CONCLUSION</font> </h2><br>  In my opinion, uleFone U7 turned out just great.  The design is simple, but time-tested and will definitely have a lot of taste, cameras are not even smart, but they allow you to make very good pictures, an excellent display with excellent protection, a capacious battery that will not allow you to remain without this device at the crucial moment.  Separately, it should be said about iron: although it is not the most top-rated, it is at a high level and will make competitors pretty nervous.  Very pleased with the presence of a separate graphics chip.  This undoubtedly allowed to unload the processor from unnecessary work and improved performance.  True RAM, in my opinion, is not enough, but not critical.
