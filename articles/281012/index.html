      Climb out of all the cracks, trying to force you to press the cherished button.  Occur with every transition on the site.  Get out in the most bad moments and prevent you from living.  Let us examine in detail why we (namely you) do not like notices on sites. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Subscription, it is everywhere </h1><br>  You go to the news site, read the news about politics ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e91/323/52c/e9132352c1248e4b176a1021914e6a11.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  You go to another news site <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/49d/0d4/2c5/49d0d42c5864ee777f75c5042f46068c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Want to read news about gadgets? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/eb9/f2f/66d/eb9f2f66d39916fd4196eafaff192c3f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Maybe sports news? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c4c/38e/2dc/c4c38e2dce6706b6f47d65c3f4185c67.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Maybe just little articles? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0fc/745/d03/0fc745d034bae7abf5cff24efd2c6282.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/29f/161/330/29f161330b85119170c3fe09e17d1242.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I once saw a site where I was offered to first subscribe to an Email newsletter, then subscribe to their community on Facebook, and then enable web push notifications on the site.  Can you get more tests and a couple of organs? <br><br>  Instead of content, I see a bunch of windows on a subscription.  Each site considers it their duty to sign me to their news.  Every day we are offered ‚ÄúWell, make this a cool pop-up window in the service, it's so cool.‚Äù GO YOU.  No windows.  You need to subscribe the user to the newsletter - let him find the widget on your site and click to subscribe by yourself. <br><br><h1>  Uncontrollability </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/80c/3a3/7e3/80c3a37e3ede6effd77522968ca48960.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I didn‚Äôt have time to scream, but then I came to the computer from the kitchen and 5 notifications from jellyfish were waiting for me.  Someone leaked information on offshore and jellyfish decided to please me with notifications.  And they all hung on the screen and waited in the wings.  And someone promised to push several times a week. <br><br>  Such websites will always have a high TTL (a month), that is, you will get pushy even after a huge tutu coming from a holiday.  Nobody will follow the priority either - your Android smartphone, if you subscribe to web pushes, it will sit down in a matter of hours, because  every notification will take him out of deep sleep. <br><br>  I can not filter this data.  It only comes to me that he wished to send the site  The filter on global notifications solves a lot of problems, like an example - I‚Äôm subscribed to PushAll on 90+ channels, if I received notifications from them all without a filter - I‚Äôd go crazy. <br><br>  Moreover - because of the filter channels push much more, reaching a large audience.  That is, the same jellyfish could send not 5 pushes a day, but 50, only now each user would receive 2-3 pushes on his subject, and not the mystical 5 pushes of what is interesting to the jellyfish editorial board. <br><br><h1>  They hang on the screen </h1><br>  I like to watch TV shows lying in bed.  The monitor is large and convenient to watch the new series.  But when a notification comes from a website via web-feeds, it hangs on the screen.  It will not disappear in 5-10 seconds, as a notification from the supplement.  It will hang until you close it. <br><br>  Do you know what it reminds me of?  Popups <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/317/542/0a0/3175420a082e3394b3639b8377e2173f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I have to get out of bed (and I usually lie in the dark and fall asleep under a blanket) and go to close the notice.  It is still white and in the dark scenes of films shines unpleasantly in the eyes. <br><br><h1>  They are not saved or synchronized. </h1><br>  Go <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4a5/384/7d5/4a53847d50f1be3cdc49d4c09e428ec0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  See this ancient picture with visty and first-generation iPhone?  Even they knew how to synchronize, but web pushes do not know how.  You have subscribed to a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãsites on a computer in your home, some where notifications have been banned and you are no longer bothered by pop-up windows asking to subscribe? <br><br>  It was not there!  Grab your phone and go through this quest first.  Then come to work and in the breaks, too, pass this quest.  Yes, yes, start clicking ‚ÄúBan‚Äù automatically. <br><br>  Also, you should reset the browser settings or reinstall the system - repeat the quest from the beginning.  Or maybe you are using chrome, ff and yandex browser?  Again, in each browser separately. <br><br>  Life hacking - <a href="https://pushall.ru/blog/destroy">turn off notifications and do not suffer.</a>  We recommend doing this to each of our users.  And for any attempts to make the introduction of alerts directly on sites with pop-up windows, we say <b>unequivocal no.</b> <br><br>  How to create a channel with the correct notifications <a href="https://pushall.ru/blog/create">can be found here</a> .  By the way, we launched a public beta test of the new version of the application for iOS, you just need to specify your mail in your profile. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/281012/">https://habr.com/ru/post/281012/</a></p>
