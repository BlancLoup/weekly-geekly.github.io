Just5</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It was time for the May holidays long ago, and I want to share my impressions of one little blue phone that brightened my eight-day rest on the Red Sea.  And this phone is Just5 CP10s Menthol Space.  Who cares what he is notable, I ask under the cat. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/eb1/d58/a27/eb1d58a27b18136d217c93e24f6a6e4c.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  <b>Foreword</b> </h4>  Going to the resort, I could not help thinking about how to deal with valuable things on the beach, the main one of which was my Samsung Galaxy S III?  Before that, I used to take some ancient Nokia N70 with me and I didn‚Äôt steal, but this time it turned out that all my old phones are out of reach, and leaving the Samsung Galaxy S III, even if in a bag, on the beach is scary.  And then friends gave a friend a friend a phone.  The full name is Just5 CP10s Blue Space, which I took from her for the duration of the trip. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9bb/96c/55b/9bb96c55b703a83bb9a0f53b62376898.jpg"><br><br><h4>  <b>Not a "grandmother"</b> </h4>  About Just5 I heard about the phones for grannies, who want to always be in touch with their grandchildren and adult children, and at the same time do not look like grannies.  The buttons on the phone are large, the functions are only basic - SMS, calls, alarm, big bright fonts.  But first I saw such a phone from ... my classmate!  She walked with Just5 and she didn‚Äôt like it.  And he looked, I confess, original, but still sad - the old series had faded colors.  The new series also pleases the eye with its acidic colors (there are only 6 of them - acid-pink, light blue, juicy orange, purple, bright yellow and with multi-colored keys).  There is also a classic "coloring" - black and white.  The hero of my review is the light blue Just5 CP10S menthol space (full name, I looked at the site, yeah).  Agree, not only grannies with such phones you can walk?  But so <s>novice hipsters</s> cute girls like me. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/714/347/03f/71434703f9308b95fb52df4304c0951d.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/78f/c11/676/78fc116769dd5c98901a0cb4cde8f252.jpg">

      In general, the company Just5 promotes the ideology of design, as demonstrated in the new line of phones.  And this is probably the only time when a company with Russian roots has entered the world market and blew up the US market.  Such a paradox - Apple came to us, and the Americans - Just5. <br><br>  To my surprise, the phone blended in well with the interior of the room (which was also decorated in white and blue), and went very well with the swimsuit, and did its job 100% - it wasn‚Äôt dead in 8 days.  Although why should he be discharged, I only called him! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f9d/28e/18c/f9d28e18c989e2426288e73067cb4a6f.jpg"><br><br><h4>  <b>Equipment</b> </h4>  The phone is in a large square glossy silver box.  Beautiful, if you give the phone, you can not wrap it in a gift wrap. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8b9/c77/80f/8b9c7780fa94a49bf114306e80e23173.jpg"><br><br>  Inside are <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c99/321/61b/c9932161b13641a6ed4ae82bba9f84e1.jpg"><br><ul><li>  the phone itself in the bag </li><li><habracut>  under the bath for the phone - bright orange charging (microUSB cable, fits my SGS III, at the end of the holiday I decided to confiscate it myself, I really liked it. And it is also easy to find in an apartment in the dimness of moles like me), </habracut></li><li>  instruction in the form of a square book for box size, </li><li>  headset (normal) </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e9f/5c6/f31/e9f5c6f31b3d185dba933ebab0c85308.jpg"><br>  Charging not to lose <br><br><h4>  <b>Appearance</b> </h4> As usual, reviewers like to write ‚ÄúThe case is made of soft-touch plastic, does not slip in the hand, does not play anything‚Äù.  Well, that's it. <br><br>  Front: <br>  The rubberized keys that click soundfully when pressed are not your finger on the sensor! <br>  The screen is color, no, not IPS, viewing angles here, to put it mildly, no: D))) Anyway, are they needed here, these viewing angles?  The main thing is that in bright sunlight the display does not blind. <br>  Speaker.  Loud.  Just like the old ladies and half-lost from the eternal headphones of creative youth. <br>  And on the screen pasted cute protective film with a smile.  Straight mi mi mi! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/eb2/bd3/cb0/eb2bd3cb0bbb4f67ea60456d5106b785.jpg"><br><br>  Behind: <br>  Soft-touch, yes.  But, it seems to me, it is mark.  With frequent yuzanie wipe or slap. <br>  The famous SOS button.  I did not need it, but they say that it is convenient for her to call the <s>narrowed-up</s> menus of quick access to five functions (emergency mode ‚ÄúSOS‚Äù, Flight Mode, Jet Lag, Just Trip, and a tool for counting events or objects, I‚Äôll tell you all about it below) . <br>  Another speaker. <br>  Cover, under which the battery and a slot for a SIM card. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/512/5bb/a03/5125bba0339c2ce6955662c5c5cc13e0.jpg"><br><br>  Right side <br>  Flashlight switch  Very handy stuff!  Here is one movement took and turned on the flashlight! <br>  Lock button  Well, everything is clear. <br>  I liked that the switches differ in color.  Certainly you will not confuse! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/969/140/d53/969140d53e454618172ebbe83f7e6b2b.jpg"><br><br>  Left side: <br>  Volume key.  It feels good, quite wide, and because of this comfortable. <br>  Key "FM".  It seems to be nothing ordinary, but that's what pleased me - the radio works even without headphones, and this is not often seen in smartphones. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/13c/6cf/f34/13c6cff34d212d275a80ac35b0f30c21.jpg"><br><br>  Top: <br>  Light bulb <br>  3.5 mm headphone jack.  Everything is standard. <br>  Lace hole.  A wide hole, a good one.  It will not be difficult to insert the lace. <br>  Photo phone on top. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/aec/2c6/940/aec2c69408afb7521b89818221a493ae.jpg"><br><br>  Bottom: <br>  Microphone. <br>  MicroUSB connector. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/48f/d77/b85/48fd77b85c63fd9c8562c36bf5a6c6c7.jpg"><br><br>  As you have already noticed from the photos - the phone is completely blue.  Only the glossy plastic frame around the edges is black and the orange ‚ÄúSuper Button‚Äù dilute the color. <br><br>  The phone is thick.  Compared with the Nokia Lumia 920 - Just5 thicker by a couple of millimeters. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2f3/ab8/b25/2f3ab8b25ea6e8efa72bc36bd12403ea.jpg"><br><br><h4>  <b>What can he do?</b> </h4>  The phone turns on when you press the "X" key.  When turned on, a cool melody plays, the Just5 icon appears. <br><br>  The menu consists of five items: ‚ÄúMessages‚Äù, ‚ÄúCalls‚Äù, ‚ÄúPhonebook‚Äù (you can save up to 250 numbers in the format name-number), ‚ÄúOrganizer‚Äù and ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù.  All that is needed.  The ruler on the right shows which tab of the overall structure we are on. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dad/48e/599/dad48e5991c27ee9bb1ffba912fabce8.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/865/f9b/931/865f9b931fc7a15b531a633e715b40d9.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c1b/972/910/c1b97291000275b7a633ef019dfdacea.jpg"><br><br>  There is no backlight.  All splendor is reflected on a black background in bright white.  Readable?  Yes! <br><br>  About the first three menu items I will not speak - here and so everything is clear.  I‚Äôll dwell on the Organizer. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d06/a5c/466/d06a5c46694d4961136311e89f347274.jpg"><br><br>  Includes: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d40/559/173/d40559173a4105c6e511408de2d1db74.jpg"><br>  Alarm clock; <br>  The calculator is the simplest calculation, it is not very convenient to use, but if it is adapted, it is tolerable; <br>  The calendar.  A very strange implementation: we see 3 lines on the screen - the first shows the day of the week and the month in the format 06.13, the second and third actually show the date, and the line contains only 4 digits, that is, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday you will have on the second line, but Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and again Monday - on the third. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0c4/049/5df/0c40495df8351183f81cf60626df3b87.jpg"><br><br>  Radio.  Autosearch is looking slowly, but the broadcast is confident, almost no sound is heard <br>  Just Trip is the simplest way to memorize a path using arrow icons.  Honestly, I did not understand how to use it. <br>  The counter - so that when you count, do not bend your fingers, but simply press ‚ÄúOK‚Äù :) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5f2/8d5/5d7/5f28d55d772a2883686c00d90bf12beb.jpg"><br><br>  A game.  So we got to the most interesting!  Leafing through the hot, scorching African sun from the boredom menu, I found the ‚ÄúGame‚Äù item.  The game is called ‚ÄúF1 Race‚Äù and is a simple race.  But what was my surprise when I saw that the game - color!  And not badly traced!  Yes, pixels, yes, almost squares, but not squares!  Here is such a pleasant surprise.  And the game is accompanied by a melody, which at first like, and then begins to enrage.  So turn it off immediately. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e41/bd3/286/e41bd328643d5e5d3452070bedec489c.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0b2/8df/d67/0b28dfd672289bbc8a157a42da5fd2c5.jpg"><br><br>  Well, the final point "Settings". <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bf1/0ca/1cf/bf10ca1cf25832afd88add4acef82072.jpg"><br><br>  In the ‚ÄúPhone‚Äù section, you can change the time and date, select the language and set the on / off schedule (at first it is not clear what kind of switching on - turning on the phone or what? But it turned out to be illuminated). <br>  In the item ‚ÄúSound‚Äù we can configure the melody (oh, this nostalgic polyphony!) Of incoming, alarm, SMS and the sound of the keys.  Polyphony is voluminous, with an echo effect, I immediately recall my good old Siemens M55 with a backlight on the sides and an internal memory of 2 MB (at that time up to 20 downloaded ringtones could be stored on it, but I got carried away with something ....), and vibration <br>  In the ‚ÄúCalls‚Äù section, calls are displayed again.  Why duplicated this item is not clear. <br><br><h5>  Functions "SuperKnopki": </h5><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/957/be4/175/957be4175ff4d99d2f076d8f2c7f30b8.jpg"><ul><li>  Emergency mode ‚ÄúSOS‚Äù - it sends SMS (with pre-set text) and attempts to dial up to five contacts in sequence.  Useful for older people, as well as residents of troubled areas. </li><li>  Flight Mode - flight mode; </li><li>  Jet Lag - time setting menu, conveniently with frequent change of time zones; </li><li>  Just Trip - I spoke about it earlier, the system of memorizing the path by the arrow icons;  Counter - I wrote about it earlier. </li></ul><br clear="left"><h4>  <b>Battery</b> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f93/e27/816/f93e2781653d1d60ae23a1d441bf1895.jpg"><br>  The battery costs 1,000 mAh.  But it lasts for 10 days. I, at least, did not discharge it during the rest. <br><br><h4>  <b>What is the result?</b> </h4><br>  As a result, a bright bright phone that performs the basic functions (for which the phone was invented) - to call and send SMS.  It‚Äôs not a shame to go with him to rest, he is perfect for the role of an original and practical gift.  I think it can be used as a second phone in addition to a powerful smartphone or tablet, which will save the last battery charge - if you play games on the tablet / smartphone, go online, take photos, and call Just5 to call and send SMS.  Yes, and with such a phone (unlike some thread Texet, for 2000 rubles ($ 65), your relatives will not feel like old men ... <br><br>  In Europe, by the way, the trend is now on simple phones.  The most popular brand is John's Phone (a brand from Holland) - even no SMS can be sent from John's Phone phones!  So it looks like Just5 is in trend ... <br><br>  A phone that will raise the dead (he has such a loud speaker and such vigorous melodies on a call).  By the way, they asked me several times what kind of phone it was (yeah, you won't surprise anyone with iPhones!) Where to buy it and how much it costs.  And here lies one of the main drawbacks - the price of such a device is 3,930 rubles ($ 125).  Hearing the price, people immediately threw their ‚Äúfi!‚Äù And left. <br><br>  Yes, the phone is cool, bright, trendy-youth, in it, I think, you can ski on skis in winter (the keys are big and not touch sensitive), but the price is scaring, you can still buy an Android smartphone for this money.  But on the other hand, Just5 is an image phone, not a budget grandma's dialer ... And in general, are there many analogues on the Russian market? <br><br>  PS In China, it is impossible to order such phones with bright colors, as the colors were developed specifically for the Just5 brand.  But if someone finds one, share the information with me. <br><br>  PS2.  It is rumored that the well-known domestic design studio will apply its hand to the next line of phones. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/182478/">https://habr.com/ru/post/182478/</a></p>
