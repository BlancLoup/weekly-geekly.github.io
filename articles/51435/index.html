In the example put the search query "download the program" against the "download soft" - who came across this article will remember the essence.

      Recently, I almost stopped using Yandex.  The reason here lies <b>not</b> in the irrelevance of issuing a search query - everything is in order with relevance.  The reason is the complexity of "communication" with the search engine in Russian.  In order to solve the simplest problem, one has to weakly strain the brain in order to formulate a more or less short uniquely defining the essence of the problem.  The same applies in principle to any search engine, be it Google or even a Rambler - you still have to think.  But personally, I started using Yandex only by the fact that at some point only he could convert ‚Äúlooking for a car‚Äù into ‚Äúsearch for a car‚Äù - there was a time when Google could not.  Now everyone can.  Only now the sense of this is no longer. <br><br>  Now for me, Yandex is a market, weather and traffic jams.  And of course the "national treasure".  Everything. <br><br>  IMHO, in English the order to formulate is much easier than in Russian.  And this order is more likely to be understood by the search engine exactly as the user would like to see it.  Accordingly, the search results will be much more relevant to the <b>essence of the</b> request, since  the form is more unambiguous than if the same thing was asked in Russian. <br><br>  And this is precisely the reason for my switching to the English-web - it is easier for me to ask a question in English and immediately get a link to the desired site on the first page in the first place than read into the issue in Russian to understand ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt it what I asked‚Äù .  That is why Google has a ‚ÄúI‚Äôm feeling lucky‚Äù button, but in Yandex it isn‚Äôt - Yandex doesn‚Äôt need it. <br><br>  I wrote all this under the impression of finding a solution to the problem of ending a CS4 trial license.  You must have faced similar difficulties :) If you were to solve this problem using Russian, it would certainly cause difficulties.  Normal Russian language to explain to the search engine that you want very hard, if you do not know exactly what to look for.  You can ask for a crack, a key, an activator, but you need a <b>solution to the problem</b> .  And here on the white horse enters the English language: Adobe Master Collection CS4 license has expired.  This is a description of the problem.  The search engine finds the <a href="http://www.google.ru/search%3Fhl%3Dru%26newwindow%3D1%26rlz%3D1C1GGLS_ruRU310RU310%26q%3DAdobe%2BMaster%2BCollection%2BCS4%2Blicense%2Bhas%2Bexpired%26btnG%3D%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%26lr%3D%26aq%3Df%26oq%3D">solution</a> itself: a <a href="http://www.google.ru/search%3Fhl%3Dru%26newwindow%3D1%26rlz%3D1C1GGLS_ruRU310RU310%26q%3DAdobe%2BMaster%2BCollection%2BCS4%2Blicense%2Bhas%2Bexpired%26btnG%3D%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%26lr%3D%26aq%3Df%26oq%3D">solution from Google</a> and a similar, but more formal <a href="http://yandex.ru/yandsearch%3Ftext%3DAdobe%2BMaster%2BCollection%2BCS4%2Blicense%2Bhas%2Bexpired%26stparhome%3Dbyes%26stpar2%3D/h0/tm1565/s1%26stpar4%3D/s1">solution from Yandex</a> .  Those who are too lazy to click on the links will say that out of 10 Google results 7 lead to torrents with drugs for greed. <br><br>  Now it remains just a little - to learn to write most competently, clearly and beautifully in English and then the long-awaited ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù will surely come :) <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> <br><br>  PS: to those who drop karma: why?  Not an interesting post?  - why did I start reading at all, at the beginning of the post there was a disclaimer on this topic.  Do you like Russian and Yandex?  - I, too, but these tools of working with information, by their very nature, are less adapted to work on the web than English and Google.  Do not agree with my views?  - write your own. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/51435/">https://habr.com/ru/post/51435/</a></p>
