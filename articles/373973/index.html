And indeed, the Chinese have solved the problem of the demand for goods from online stores radically: in order not to dissolve in the global madness of Black Friday, they invented their own, with discounts and coupons.  World Trade Day has become a lucrative mix of shopping crust and fake online discounts.  In addition, he has acquired some very unusual features.  We will tell you something about them today, and at the same time we will merge information about our discounts a little in advance.  And you think that we have not been so long ago?  - We sawed landings.  China goes to you. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7e0/78e/e03/7e078ee038774b58a2cee81c792714bc.jpg"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5e0/2cc/e68/5e02cce68e3f02bc4b2191044979aafa.jpg" align="left">  We also did not pass by </h2>  Gearbest has firmly occupied its niche among Chinese retail.

Chinese smartphones have found their place in absolutely all niches: from low-end models to expensive and desirable flagships.  Some brands have become global competitors of the iPhone and Samsung.  As always, the big luck is to blame for everything: firstly, in China there is access to inexpensive materials and components;  secondly, the experience of manufacturing mobile phones for other brands;  thirdly, the optimal division of labor within the same territory with a single tax regime and simplified logistics. <br><br>  24 hours of Chinese shopping day volume surpass Black Friday and Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãMonday combined.  It is not by chance that the British article ‚ÄúThe Telegraph‚Äù began its article on 11/11/2016 with the words ‚ÄúForget <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/black-friday-2016-best-deals/">tiny little Black Friday</a> ‚Äù (‚ÄúForget about tiny Black Friday‚Äù).  Moreover, 11.11 has become more interesting in terms of sales not only for Chinese retailers.  Bachelor's Day opened up a huge reservoir of consumption for global e-commerce - the middle class of Chinese residents (600-700 million potential buyers). <br><br>  On this day, the Chinese even buy the metro directly from their own phones, and the average purchase price is $ 500, although three years ago there was only $ 180. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/968/604/8c2/9686048c20fc1466b09da0216a02f987.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">The usual place in China on November 11 of any year :)</font></i> <br><br>  For manufacturers and retailers of the United States 11.11 was a convenient chance to get to the wallets of Chinese consumers.  But at the same time, Americans have to sacrifice margin, because the Chinese are familiar with all the tricks of sellers and are looking for only the lowest prices.  Meanwhile, the Chinese themselves no longer want low-quality products and are looking for genuine high-quality products, especially with regard to food, children and luxury goods.  They are aware that they should not trust the authenticity and safety of products within their home country.  So, in 2016, 27% of Chinese purchases fell on non-Chinese online stores. <br><br>  But with a great interest in the Chinese market, Britain cannot actively integrate into the 11.11 orgy.  It promotes individual brands and even presents virtual reality stores for users from the Middle Kingdom, but it is not included in the festival sales mood.  And all because November 11 in Great Britain is a day of remembrance: at 11 o'clock on the 11th of the 11th month, the signing of a truce between the allies and Germany in the First World War (1918) is celebrated. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/748/d26/f07/748d26f070d521fd6c9c3a00ee3e3cf1.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Remember!</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">- red poppy in the UK as a symbol of memory</font></i> <br><br>  Holiday 11.11 in China has become also a cultural tradition - on this day parades, festivals, performances and performances are held throughout the country.  So, a couple of years ago Kevin Spacey took part in a pop show dedicated to the holiday - his house of Cards is so popular in China that it‚Äôs hard to imagine how people will survive the actor‚Äôs likely departure from the film.  And in 2016, the invited guest of one of the biggest festivals ‚Äúin the name of retail‚Äù was football player David Beckham and his wife. <br><br>  Russia has long been a stable market for Chinese e-commerce, and not its tidbit.  Efforts and capital are now directed towards the conquest of India, Brazil and South America.  Manufacturers even produce special smartphones for the Indian market.  By the way, IT companies and retail often talk about the prospects of Brazil, but the low income level of the population does not allow them to turn around with goods for the middle and income segments. <br><br>  And now about the sad, because 11.11 - this is such an anti Valentine's Day, the day of singles or Bachelor's Day.  In China, everything is very, very bad.  By 2030, it is estimated that one in four Chinese men aged 30 years will never marry.  They already have almost 30 million guys more than girls.  Such statistics. <br><br>  Well, just a beautiful game of numbers, as without such pieces: <br><br>  (2 digits) 11 x 11 = 121 <br>  (6 digits) 111111 x 111111 = 12345654321 <br>  (9 digits) 111111111 x 111111111 = 12345678987654321 <br><br><h3><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5e0/2cc/e68/5e02cce68e3f02bc4b2191044979aafa.jpg" align="left">  For those who want to join the sale </h3>  Discounts, pages, flash and many, many things: <br><br>  The most important pages with our branded navigation: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://ru.gearbest.com/m-promotion-active-360.html%3F123%3Flkid%3D10721409">Russian page sales and activities</a> <br></li><li>  <a href="http://gearbestblog.ru/russkij-den-holostyaka-11-11-ru-gearbest/">Details about the Russian sale in our blog.</a> <br></li><li>  <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/m-promotion-active-349.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">English page sales and activities</a> (goods are different!) <br></li></ul><br>  Thematic landings for the laziest to look for: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/promotion-11.11-creality-3d-special-1652.html%3F123%3Flkid%3D10721409">3D printers</a> <br></li><li>  <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/promotion-healthy-life-special-993.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">health and beauty</a> <br></li><li>  <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/promotion-led-lights-amp-flashlights-special-491.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">Lamps, lamps, lanterns</a> <br></li><li>  <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/promotion-best-selling-knives-special-695.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">The coolest knives, knives, knives</a> <br></li><li>  <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/promotion-stunning-home-tech-special-863.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">Techno-tusa</a> <br></li><li>  <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/promotion-11.11-vapor-party-special-1668.html%3Fdfghk%3Flkid%3D10721409">Vapes</a> that we do not vape and do not advise you <br></li></ul><br>  Games, lotteries, coupons and all that: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://ru.gearbest.com/m-promotion-active-367.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">Playing with the prize draw and coupons</a> (among the prizes - a <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/electric-bikes/pp_931863.html%3Flkid%3D11754678">scooter Xiaomi</a> ) <br></li><li>  <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/m-markup_buy-active-74.html%3Flkid%3D11754678%3Flkid%3D10721409">Prizes-additives</a> depending on the purchase amount - low prices <br></li><li>  <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/promotion-pay-nothing-special-1614.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">Another game where you do not need to pay</a> <br></li><li>  $ 1111 for one screenshot - <a href="http://gearbestblog.ru/rozygrysh-gearbest-1111-dollarov-za-skrinshot/">details</a> <br></li><li>  <a href="http://gearbestblog.ru/11-11-flash-sale-gearbest-den-holostyaka-11-11">About flash sales</a> <br></li><li>  <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/m-promotion-active-352.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">New game</a> <br></li><li>  Also - pay attention - there are bags of surprises on each of the sales pages <br></li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/570/575/9b2/5705759b28a8c3884fc25581cdd96d51.png" align="left" width="20">  The latest news, discounts, etc.  - <a href="https://vk.com/gearbest">we have VKontakte</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a74/5bf/31d/a745bf31dc44b7612273db4b6d869342.jpg" align="left" width="20">  Fresh only in <a href="https://t.me/gearbestsale">our Telegram</a> <br><br>  Gearbest warns: New Year on the nose - it's time to order gifts! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/373973/">https://habr.com/ru/post/373973/</a></p>
