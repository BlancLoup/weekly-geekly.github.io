Hello?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/09a/02b/71d/09a02b71dfb34715176f8a7b6bd53421.jpg"><br>  Many people know the phrase from the famous Big Bang Theory series <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D61a0qHFcQE4">‚ÄúEverything is better with bluetooth‚Äù</a> .  But sometimes bluetooth really makes things better.  For example, take a car rearview mirror.  What happens if you add bluetooth to it?  Get a great hands-free headset!  Do not believe?  Welcome under the cut!  (under which, of course, the description, a lot of clickable photos and traffic) <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I received it in a not quite standard way: using bonus points that dripped into the account for using a Visa card in my bank.  The catalog was listed as "BlueSky Tech Bluetooth Handsfree Car Kit", the manufacturer <a href="http://www.blueskytechusa.com/bluesky_product-information-1001b.html">'s</a> website <a href="http://www.blueskytechusa.com/bluesky_product-information-1001b.html">here</a> .  In general, I ordered, a week later I received a notification, I took the box (the box turned out to be a bit crumpled, but the contents were not damaged). <br><br><h3>  Turn your back on me ... in front ... sideways .... </h3><br>  Inspect from all sides.  Externally - a box like a box, nothing special (except for dents) <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5f0/a6b/14a/5f0a6b14a94ba67e77b774318abb4c79.jpg"></a>

      Open up.  View standard: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/87b/5d3/360/87b5d336063f02cade1b8125467cfefc.jpg"></a> <br><br>  The mirror itself, the plug in the cigarette lighter, the "ear", under the mirror - the cord and the instruction.  We get all this economy: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/477/34d/412/47734d412b92db91a6eb047219d3acd8.jpg"></a> <br><br>  The mirror itself is nothing remarkable: standard size, standard shape, the surface is slightly darkened, does not interfere at all during the day, and at night it is more pleasant - not so blinding the eyes, if behind some kind of ‚Äúchudil‚Äù with high beam or not too bright xenon :) There is also a small display, which at first glance is completely invisible and does not interfere with the review.  At the lower border are the main control buttons in the amount of 5 pieces: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/336/ec7/0db/336ec70dbe43978c008a27788de57286.jpg"></a> <br><br>  To the right and left of the control buttons are the ‚Äúholes‚Äù of the microphone: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dd9/cdd/fca/dd9cddfca295d10b3c4732e71f74f636.jpg"></a> <br><br>  On top is the on / off slider, the FM frequency selection button (more on that later) and the ‚Äúspeakers / car speakers‚Äù mode slider (yes, more on that later, but the most intelligent readers probably already guessed): <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/235/f79/ff4/235f79ff47a4dbfb9af980b10543efbc.jpg"></a> <br><br>  The left end does not contain anything, on the right side there is a nest for an ‚Äúear plug‚Äù, which is not a headset in itself, but merely receives sound from a mirror. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e7a/5e4/bdd/e7a5e4bddbb6459f96d1c06fb0dc3f62.jpg"></a> <br><br>  The ear is inserted into the connector very easily, it rests on a magnet (I suspect that the speaker itself uses a magnet): <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9e9/35b/3c9/9e935b3c911099c83eb99d0ff4152b7e.jpg"></a> <br><br>  On the bottom side there is a charging connector (regular mini-USB) and a volume control <i>roller</i> (quite a strange, from my point of view, design solution, in the 21st century, but oh well, not so often I will use it): <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cef/894/5a2/cef8945a2bbe90444fa01ff4eaf5e600.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Rear - speaker and mounting.  The device is mounted on top of the existing mirror with the help of four ‚Äúlegs‚Äù.  The upper "legs" are fixed, the lower ones are spring-loaded, therefore, in theory, can be mounted on any mirror: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5f4/081/bf1/5f4081bf1f0c457923b0015f7d048b3e.jpg"></a> <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/57a/348/c73/57a348c73a8d4155afd8de22ac6c5520.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Well, viewed from all sides, it's time to turn on.  Charging is done wisely - a standard ‚ÄúUSB &lt;-&gt; mini-USB‚Äù cord, so you can charge it from a computer.  The cigarette lighter plug has a USB port into which the cord is plugged.  The plug has another strange hole, the purpose of which I did not quite understand: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1d0/ffc/f64/1d0ffcf6443b4f0cddd50bdcfdc61ab7.jpg"></a> <br><br>  We turn on the charge (the handset indicator on the middle button starts to turn red), at the same time we turn on the search for the headset with the phone.  We find, we ‚Äúpair‚Äù - the indicator acquires a lilac shade (red - charging, blue - bluetooth).  When the mirror detects the phone, it displays ‚ÄúConnected‚Äù, and then shows the phone name: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/448/15e/cec/44815ececfb4f87631405596ea0005fc.jpg"></a> <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/010/2ed/7d7/0102ed7d785b7f13b65bd300b2b4dd92.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Actually, this can already begin to use.  When an incoming call is received, the sound from the speaker is heard, and the caller's number is displayed.  However, the number is the last century, right?  Therefore, in the device you can save contacts from the phone.  We select a contact from the address book and transmit by the same bluetooth - and then when an incoming call is displayed, not the caller's number, but the name is displayed.  Contacts will have to fill one by one, information about how to pour a pack, the instructions were not. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/209/b01/152/209b01152357d906f4e86a0f11ebf4cb.jpg"></a> <br><br><h3>  Control </h3><br>  Almost all control is carried out by the central button with the tube icon.  Click on it when you receive a call - answer the call.  She ends the conversation.  Double-click when a call is received - reset the call.  Long press - to hold the call (and then switch between the interlocutors).  Standby in standby mode - dial the last dialed number.  Single click in standby mode - voice dialing (if the phone supports). <br>  The left button (‚ÄúUp‚Äù) in the standby mode shows the last dialed numbers.  The "Down" button opens the address book (not the phone book, but your own), displaying the name and number (in 2 lines).  Buttons "Rec" and "Play", as the name implies, record and play a record.  Recording can be done only one, which overwrites the previous ones (recording duration is not more than 30 seconds)  I see so far only one application: when you call and ask how to drive somewhere.  I asked, recorded the answer - and then you start playback as you approach key points. <br><br><h3>  FM </h3><br>  The device can broadcast sound on the FM-frequency.  The disadvantage is that the frequency set is preset (6 different frequencies), and it‚Äôs not possible to choose an arbitrary one, which can be a problem if the broadcast is tightly clogged.  Although in theory, even if tuned to the frequency used by any radio station, the transmitter should jam it, blocking the air with its broadcasting.  Both to myself and to neighboring cars that will be ‚Äúhappy‚Äù hear someone‚Äôs conversation (one half of it) :) <br><br><h3>  Sound time </h3><br>  I use the built-in speaker, I tried it through the speakers of the radio only once.  The sound is good, without interference, without echo. <br>  True, the maximum volume could be more.  Not that you have to listen - no, everything is audible well, but I'm not used to the fact that I have to set any device to the maximum volume.  Those.  there is simply no stock. <br>  From one charge the device has been working for a week already, it does not ask for porridge.  The total duration of trips is 1.5-2 hours per day.  On the manufacturer's website stated 168 hours of work. <br><br><h3>  Total </h3><br>  Pros: <br>  + always in the car (do not forget at home) <br>  + displays the caller - no need to be distracted by the phone itself <br>  + one touch recording <br>  + supports many features (call hold, voice dialing) <br>  + FM broadcasting - you can broadcast in the radio <br><br>  Minuses: <br>  - there is no synchronization with the address book of the phone (you have to manually transfer one by one) <br>  - recording of only one conversation (and no more than 30 seconds) <br>  - there is no FM broadcast frequency setting - only preset frequencies <br>  - no volume margin <br><br>  In general, I am satisfied with the device, I use it with pleasure both as a mirror and as a headset. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> pictures of the car: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a5d/5a0/36a/a5d5a036ad45c0fddad160ae17757e11.jpg"></a> <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3f8/601/4d4/3f86014d4095b689f54c2cc069bf3be0.jpg"></a> <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e7a/1ae/d6d/e7a1aed6d1d9668b28398796eeed5c3a.jpg"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/81557/">https://habr.com/ru/post/81557/</a></p>
