Today, much higher buildings are already attributed to skyscrapers - from 130 meters.  In Russia, the story begins in 1913, with the construction of a seven-story building, and now the country ranks 15th in the global ranking with 38 completed skyscrapers. <br><br>  ‚Üí <i><a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/285758/">The highest skyscrapers of the world.</a></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/908/2ff/080/9082ff08020497e5e5b3bf00f1cc929e.png" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Constructivism: the first skyscraper </h4><br>  In 1913, at the corner of Kalashny lane in Moscow, a merchant A. I. Titov completed a seven-story apartment building.  Under the guidance of architect Nikolai Dmitrievich Strukov, the house was built in a hurry, but in March 1913 one of the walls collapsed and filled the alley with bricks, logs and iron fragments in the height of two floors.  This was the third collapsed structure of Strukov.  The house was reduced to five floors, but by 1923-1925 the sixth and seventh were again built, and the building itself went to Mosselprom.

      In 1925, a flour warehouse and the administration of Moscow grocery stores and beer shops were placed on the first floor of the building, above were the directorate, the accounting department, the communist cell and the local committee.  The workers of the Babayevsky factory lived in the residential part of the building. <br><br>  Here we are talking only about seven floors - this house is not so high.  And in the 1950s, the construction of high-rise buildings began with much more zeal. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/000/fdf/3eb/000fdf3ebf6bd4d44abf1ea43b3e08a8.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d3c/2d8/4d6/d3c2d84d6bda5a923ac78b265defb16e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/eba/168/01a/eba16801a27746131bb3f6aa67e5d2fb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Staliens: Seven Stalin's skyscrapers </h4><br>  In 1930, the Stalinist architecture, or Stalans, took the stage, replacing rationalism and constructivism.  Seven skyscrapers in Moscow are called "seven sisters" or "seven Stalin skyscrapers".  Initially, the USSR Council of Ministers in 1947 decided to build eight tall buildings, of which the highest was supposed to be the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2586_%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2">Palace of Soviets</a> on the site of the blown-up Temple of Christ the Savior.

This house alone was to become a ‚Äúcity within a city.‚Äù  In order to have enough space for this one building, four lanes were demolished in Moscow. <br><br>  It all started with the ‚ÄúOld‚Äù building, a 9-storey residential building overlooking the Moscow River, completed in 1940 - before the decision of the Council of Ministers to build high-rises.

The height of the skyscraper is 138 meters, this is 24 floors in the central building.  The side hulls have floors from 11 to 15. <br><br>  Under one of the buildings is located the lobby of the metro station Krasnye Vorota.  But the most interesting thing is that the station and the building were built simultaneously.  For a while the house had to stand on the edge of the pit, and after the precipitation of the soil, it would tilt.  The problem was solved by building the building initially with a slope, and the ground froze.  When the ground melted, the building sagged and fell vertically.  This task was so difficult to calculate that they never used the method anywhere else. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/abc/e0d/1cf/abce0d1cfc3704e7634b97079359cb3d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ed1/b16/7a9/ed1b167a995f8d726f3c67332b69dcda.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bfc/12a/e45/bfc12ae45a128f22c3aa72c4ad551b92.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In 1955, aviation industry workers and test pilots received apartments in a <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2596%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC_%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0_%25D0%259A%25D1%2583%25D0%25B4%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D1%2589%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8">residential building with 450 apartments</a> built on Kudrinskaya Square.

Too chic seemed interior.  The newspaper Pravda wrote in 1955: ‚ÄúMajor excesses were allowed in the design and construction of high-rise buildings.  For example, the construction of the Leningradskaya Hotel for three hundred and fifty-four rooms on Kalanchevskaya Square in Moscow (architects Polyakov and Boretsky) spent as much money as would have been needed to build an economically designed hotel for a thousand rooms ‚Äù( <a href="http://www.admagazine.ru/inter/62245_gostinitsa-leningradskaya.php">source</a> ). <br><br>  The newspaper took these theses from a speech by Nikita Khrushchev, where he compares Stalin's skyscrapers and many other buildings, distinguished by the beauty of architecture and decoration, the presence of stucco molding and chandeliers, with churches:  So?  Silhouette such, comrades.  Take with Kuntsevo look it.  Do you like the silhouette of the church?  I somehow, you know, do not want to argue with your taste.  But for housing it is not necessary.  After all, God does not live in church, he uses this church for certain purposes. ‚Äù  And after that Polyakov was deprived of the Stalin Prize.  Although the architect of this award was not.  Other architects in a hurry simplified the houses that were already built, the massive construction of the "abrasive" houses began - buildings without exterior decoration, ugly five-story boxes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e50/193/be1/e50193be13a56e5c8e11c4435624c7a9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/68d/2b4/752/68d2b4752d7144b30f36e4a295841516.jpg" alt="image"><br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8c2/325/dd2/8c2325dd2ad1807b12be47e7165e186d.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  And below in the photo - Woolworth Building.  It strongly resembles the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  Architect Vyacheslav Oltarzhevsky, who was commissioned in 1947 to develop a project for the construction of high-rise buildings, received additional education at New York University and for 11 years of his life in the United States implemented several projects, including skyscrapers.  Having accumulated experience and ideas, Oltarzhevsky tried to follow in order to develop them to maximalism, or better - ‚ÄúBolshevism‚Äù.  He took neo-gothic and with imperial scale turned it into a Stalinist empire. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7ba/343/371/7ba343371043e3a52ad434d03016b64f.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Modernism: Moscow City </h4><br>  In the rating of skyscrapers of Russia, the first 12 positions, except the seventh, are occupied by the Moscow-City towers.

The tower "East" in Moscow City has risen above the city by 373.7 meters, it is 97 floors.  "West" is somewhat lower - only 62 floors and the same 240 meters, as in Moscow State University.  The foundation for the construction of the Federation Tower complex left 14 thousand cubic meters of concrete, which was recorded in the Guinness Book of Records. <br><br>  Towers from the foundation to the upper floor permeate 25 perimeter columns.
