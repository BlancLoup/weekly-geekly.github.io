But they still lose. <br><br>  If the call in your company is accepted by the office manager, and not by the sales department specialist, ask yourself: did you teach him to sell?  Yes, yes, to sell, not the final service or product, but the next step, which is necessary for the sale to take place. <br><br>  " <i><b>Hello! Yes, we do the service, it costs 10,000 rubles. Please. Goodbye!</b></i> " - Do you know such words of an office manager? <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      First, of course, not "Hello!": <br><ul><li>  do not force the Client to specify where he got, call the company </li><li>  let him be comfortable with you - introduce yourself </li><li>  ask how you can be useful </li></ul>  The attitude of the Client to the company consists of trifles. <br><br>  And of course, a non-professional seller should not immediately respond to the Client when asked about the cost and / or properties of a product or service. <br>  The dialogue, as a rule, ends there. <br><br>  The main thing that needs to be done after the Client‚Äôs question is to try to get his contacts so as not to lose him irrevocably in case of any development of events (for example, an unsuccessful switch to a manager). <br><br>  If the Client's question is clear to whom to forward, then the office manager should ‚Äúsell‚Äù the communication with a professional seller competent in this matter, and not try to advise on his own.  Even if he knows everything (as he thinks) and can easily answer himself and immediately. <br><br>  But it may turn out that not a single manager can answer the Client right now - in this case, you need to ‚Äúsell‚Äù the callback and take all the necessary contacts and information so that the seller can prepare for a minimum. <br><br>  Plus, there are many nuances in different businesses. <br>  For example, we are often called to an advertising agency with the questions ‚Äú <i>How much does a banner print cost?</i> ‚Äù, ‚Äú <i>Can you quickly print flyers?</i> ‚Äù, ‚Äú <i>Do you conduct promotions?</i> ‚Äù.  And all this despite the fact that for several years we have been engaged in advertising only on the Internet. <br>  It would seem that these are not targeted calls, and they cannot sell anything, but this is a contact!  And we decided that we would try to get it. <br><br>  Our office manager has a script with detailed instructions ‚ÄúHow to answer an incoming call,‚Äù which he strictly follows. <br>  If there is an incoming request for services that we do not provide, then the office manager says that he will send a list of reliable and trusted partners, and takes mail, a name and telephone number and a company of a potential client.  And then leads the CRM lead for the sales department. <br><ul><li>  First, we achieve the wow-effect, initially earning loyalty; </li><li>  Secondly, we get the contact of the client who plans to invest in advertising.  There is a chance to transfer it to our services. </li></ul><br>  Contacts are sent in a template letter within 20 minutes. <br>  In this simple way, we have concluded several contracts. <br><br>  Of course, an office manager often needs just one A4 sheet, on which all the correct phrases and scenarios are written. <br>  But, if there are a lot of nuances in your incoming calls before switching to the seller, or the office manager periodically still has to act as a seller, we advise you to use technical solutions for conveniently following the developed script. <br><br>  In the last article, <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/callhelper_kitmedia/blog/14372/">we talked about</a> why <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/callhelper_kitmedia/blog/14372/">we</a> wrote such a solution ourselves and how we teach newbies faster with it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/289842/">https://habr.com/ru/post/289842/</a></p>
