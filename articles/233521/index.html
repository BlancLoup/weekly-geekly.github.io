  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why did Windows RT for tablets never fly up?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  More than two years ago, a poll was posted on Habr√© <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/146883/">What percentage of the market can a tablet occupy on Windows RT in the next 2 years?</a>  .  The post was published on July 1, 2012. Responding to a question, the audience was divided, but more than half chose the answer - <strong>Less than 10%.</strong> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fc7/c9f/9b8/fc7c9f9b8f3a901eb9b2e21a5a08fd3c.png" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  During these two years, the production of tablets on Windows RT was abandoned: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.superplanshet.ru/dell/dell-prekraschaet-vipusk-planshetov-na-windows-rt">Dell - Dell discontinues tablets on Windows RT</a> <br></li><li>  <a href="http://technodaily.ru/%3Fp%3D12732">Samsung - Samsung stops selling tablets on Windows RT</a> <br></li><li>  <a href="http://4pda.ru/2013/05/06/99500/">Acer - Acer does not see the point in Windows 8 RT, but is going to release Iconia A3</a> <br></li><li>  <a href="http://www.f1cd.ru/news/asus_otkazyvaetsya_ot_windows_rt/">ASUS - ASUS refuses Windows RT</a> <br></li><li>  <a href="http://gadgetick.com/newsnew-8.html">HP - HP refuses to release ARM devices on Windows RT</a> <br></li></ul><br>  Cut production <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.3dnews.ru/824271/">Lenovo - Lenovo reduces sales of small Windows tablets in the US</a> <br></li></ul><br>  Now the manufacturers mentioned above either have completely refused to release tablets for Windows RT, or release them on Windows 8 x86 architecture. <br><br>  <strong>Current market share in Windows RT tablets</strong> <br>  According to the report on the use of mobile operating systems for the second quarter of 2014 <a href="http://nvworld.ru/news/tags/%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5%2520%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D1%258B/">by Strategy Analytics</a> , the share of Microsoft OS in the world <strong>is 2.7%.</strong>  The report indicates operating systems for smartphones.  Smartphones are cheaper, and buyers buy them first.  Therefore, even if this figure is doubled, i.e.  for each smartphone sold there is one tablet with Windows RT, then it <strong>will be 5.24%</strong> .  For comparison, the <strong>share of Android devices is 84.6%.</strong> <br>  In Russia, Surface RT tablets sell only two retail chains. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ab9/057/d7c/ab9057d7cf5f74e9c21fb912cd8f9b81.png" alt="image"><br>  There are enough opinions on the network why Microsoft did not work with a mobile OS.  Some scold the new interface.  Others did not find killer features.  <u><strong><em>I express my personal opinion only, without claiming to the Absolute truth.</em></strong></u>

      <strong>1. Microsoft itself did not understand why it needs Windows RT, and what it is</strong> <br>  Let's go to the <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/ru-ru/windows/windows-rt-faq">Windows RT 8.1</a> page <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/ru-ru/windows/windows-rt-faq">: questions and answers</a> .  Question - <strong>What is the difference between Windows RT 8.1 and Windows 8.1?</strong> <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">What is the difference between Windows RT 8.1 and Windows 8.1?</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/94d/2a9/bb6/94d2a9bb6ba798f853fc0ec99f9c859d.png" alt="image"></div></div><br>  Not to the experienced user who is friends with logic will become clear.  Windows RT 8.1 is an unfinished OS, it does not have Windows Media Player, there is no remote control via RDP, and you also cannot install classic programs.  Moreover, not all hardware is compatible - ‚ÄúOnly printers, mice, keyboards and other devices with the Designed for Windows RT logo can be installed. <br>  Now let's try to determine <strong>‚ÄúWhich computer to choose: running Windows RT 8.1 or Windows 8.1?‚Äù</strong> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/13b/046/6d3/13b0466d3cdb3a4d94a32267585f49cb.png" alt="image"><br>  And Microsoft will redirect us to the address - <a title="http://windows.microsoft.com/ru-ru/windows-8/windows-pcs" href="http://windows.microsoft.com/ru-ru/windows-8/windows-pcs">http://windows.microsoft.com/ru-ru/windows-8/windows-pcs.</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/93a/9b2/59a/93a9b259a76990dfb59d867239c57d05.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Where it was expected to see a set of questions, answering which Microsoft would recommend to choose what we need.  But no, there is no wizard, there is only a list of available models.  And it is not clear that Windows RT 8.1 or Windows 8.1 is installed on these devices. <br>  Please, if this post is read by Microsoft employees, write when and in what cases a tablet should be chosen for a regular user under Windows RT 8.1 or Windows 8.1, or provide a link to the answer. <br><br>  <strong>2. The crisis of ideas</strong> <br><ul><li>  in 1980, Microsft bought QDOS from Seattle Computer Products, subsequently MS-DOS. </li><li>  The roots of the famous Microsoft SQL Server DBMS come from the company Sybase. </li><li>  In 2002, Microsoft acquired Navision a / s and released Microsoft Business Solutions - Navision 3.60 - now it‚Äôs a Microsoft Dynamics CRM system. </li><li>  Corporate Social Network - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/146512/">Microsoft buys Yammer for $ 1.2 billion</a> </li><li>  Microsoft Visio package was also purchased.  The first Visio was still 16-bit and worked under Windows 3.11. </li><li>  Skype has been purchased for the development of Internet communications. </li><li>  Microsoft Hyper-V virtualization, begins with the acquisition of Connectix in 2003, the package is VirtualPC. </li><li>  Kinect for Microsft created the company PrimeSense </li></ul><br>  You can continue to continue.  The whole life of Microsoft is based on borrowing ideas from the outside, it is either entirely the purchase of companies along with intellectual property, or partnership.  Now, apparently, no, unfortunately Microsoft, a new startup of a mobile OS. <br><br>  <strong>3. Unfair practices</strong> <br>  Microsoft has almost always led backstage games.  The first big deal, squeezing the Navigator Netscape from the browser market.  Microsoft integrated its Internet Explorer into the OS.  This led to the filing of a lawsuit against Microsoft by the antitrust division of the US Department of Justice. <br>  Then there were proceedings in the European Union.  Remember the editors of Windows 7 N, for the European Union?  Without a built-in browser, player, and media center. <br>  The structure of the formats MS Office doc, xls, ppt, Microsoft has not yet been published in full, thereby significantly restricting competition.  Then came the open Microsoft Office Open XML File Format.  The problem was solved, but even here the style of Microsoft remained.  ‚ÄúAlthough Open XML became the ECMA standard in 2006 and the ISO standard in 2008, Microsoft itself has not yet offered a full-fledged implementation of this standard in its original form.  Instead, Microsoft Office applications saved documents in a format called Transitional Open XML (‚ÄúTransitional Open XML‚Äù), which is a version of the ISO standard designed to ‚Äúprovide a transition period when users migrate from existing binary document formats (to Open XML). could save the inherited functions and full-fledged work with the old formats ".  The incomplete implementation of the standard was bad news for developers of competing packages, including the popular LibreOffice, who hoped that switching to XML formats would help improve compatibility with Office documents.  In order to fully support the transitional version of the Transitional Open XML format, competing products had to implement all the inherited features of Office, and this required almost <strong>illegal reverse engineering of Microsoft closed products.</strong> ‚ÄùThe <a href="http://news.softportal.com/nitem-12795.html">source of Office 2013 will eventually support its own and competing standards.</a> <br>  The arsenal of old receptions is over.  Compatibility with old programs, they actually are not needed.  A new type of device involves a new principle of interaction, so old programs are simply rewritten for new platforms Android and iOS.  Although Microsoft is pushing here, Microsoft is <a href="http://www.itw.su/18-11-2013-microsoft-zarabatyvaet-na-android-2-mlrd-v-god/">earning $ 2 billion a year from Android</a> . <br><br>  <strong>4. Tablet, smartphone, it is not a DESKTOP COMPUTER, but consumer electronics</strong> <br>  Microsoft is not a company, and not a corporation, it is a whole empire for making money.  For comfortable and safe work, with Windows the user is forced to buy a lot of third-party software.  ANTI-VIRUS, haven‚Äôt IT technologies in their decades been able to achieve protection against viruses?  For some reason, Android for its modest years, got rid of this problem, but Windows is not.  If you listen to the main <strike>virus</strike> writer of the country's defender, Evgeny Kaspersky, then Android now has +100500 viruses, as well as iOS.  But strangely enough, to protect your Android device, all you need is to prohibit installing applications other than the official market, do not download files with the .apk extension, read the list of permissions for each application installed.  I use the Chinese Android phone, stuffed with a bunch of spyware from the Chinese government, for more than 2 years, installed many programs, but did not catch a single virus.  WHAT AM I DOING WRONG? <br><br>  And you need to call the wizard for installing, configuring, cleaning your computer from viruses, Trojans, temporary files that fill the hard drive.  In general, the housewife just does not understand.  Therefore, when users saw the first iPhone, they all had a roof.  And it was for that.  Despite my biased contempt for apple products, my deepest respect to Steve Jobs, for which he showed a smartphone WITHOUT A STYLUS.  Without the iPhone, we would still be poking at the screen with a stylus, as in the era of Windows Mobile.  Windows Mobile was a miniature PC upgrade; it was called Pocket PC.  I hope the main point conveyed to the reader.  A smartphone, a tablet, it is not COMPUTERS.  This is not the cornerstone device for all tasks.  This is part of consumer electronics (like TV, stove, electric kettle, etc.).  If before the PC was the main device for accessing information processing, now it is not.  Now we are doing some business on a smartphone, others on a tablet.  There will be more new devices, the same we borrow them.  Now it doesn't matter where, and with the help of what we work with information.  A new concept of data processing, we will move on to it without any problems.  And Microsoft, and is worn with the old idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa PERSONAL COMPUTER installed in a <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25CA%25F0%25E0%25F1%25ED%25FB%25E9_%25F3%25E3%25EE%25EB">red corner</a> . <br><br>  <strong>Total</strong> <br>  Gathering the first lines of this post were ideas for rectifying the situation, such as - what if Microsoft makes a new OS server and client ABSOLUTELY FREE WITH FREE CAL-LICENSES.  And make Windows - Open Source project.  And then all the other players will go the distance.  By the end of the post it became clear the absurdity of this step, Microsoft will never do this.  Or Microsoft will hire super brilliant programmers, and everything will be cool.  But nothing will happen.  The share of Android will continue to grow, the share of iOS will grow due to a decrease in other platforms and Windows Phone.  Between Android and iOS, a certain percentage will be established, constant for a long time.  Since  it does not depend on technological advantage, but on the division of people into different social groups.  And the ratio will change only in the case of change, the formation of social strata of society. <br>  So the PC era will end.  It will not happen immediately, and not quickly. <br><br>  <strong>extracurricular reading</strong> <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://proshivku.ru/novosti/windows-onecore-pervyj-shag-microsoft-k-sozdaniyu-universalnoj-operatsionnoj-sistemy%3Futm_source%3Dtwitterfeed%26amp%3Butm_medium%3Dtwitter">Windows OneCore - the first step for Microsoft to create a universal operating system</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://ss.thevista.ru/page17368-microsoft_mozhet_sdelat_windows_9_besplatnoy">Microsoft can make Windows 9 free</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://ss.thevista.ru/page17374-v_skorom_budushchem_planshety_surface_nachnut_prinosit_pribyl">In the near future, Surface tablets will start to make a profit.</a> </li><li>  Be sure to read <a href="http://www.brandreport.ru/edsel/">the Ford Edsel Brand Story</a> </li></ul><br>  PS <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/smartgadget/blog/233517/">Latest statistics reports on smartphones: in Russia and not only</a> . <br>  Please again minuschimuschim, write at least the reasons. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/233521/">https://habr.com/ru/post/233521/</a></p>
