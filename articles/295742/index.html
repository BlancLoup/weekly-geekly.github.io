(how it was)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> <i>The feeling of celebration and awareness of the high level of the event appeared somehow immediately, and it was not a matter of delicious cakes and coffee (although the cakes really were very much), but just something that was in the air.</i>  <i>Probably the secret is that only those who understand what <b>email-marketing is</b> and why the business needs it have gathered at <a href="http://mailcon.ru/">MailCon</a> in Yekaterinburg.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>This is the case when to name the best report would be problematic, because here they were collected - the best.</i>  <i>So - a short report in order for those who missed the conference.</i>  <i>Write in the comments, what it would be interesting to know in more detail - we will write in more detail!</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/78b/a1e/42e/78ba1e42eeba4b3eaebd68475dc684eb.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Daniel Silantyev (Inbox Marketing), with his inherent humor, told about why competitors should be monitored about the Email-Competitors project, and about typical mistakes of an email-marketer. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/20a/d9f/6d6/20ad9f6d6b34433c8a7296642a73edfd.jpg" width="600"><br>  Beautiful from Daniel: "Open rate is a spherical horse in a vacuum." <br><br>  Oleg Basha (GetResponse) has built an email marketing strategy, decomposing into 7 basic steps: preparation - auto series - campaigns - collection base - segmentation - Big Data.  A lot of useful, cases, great slides. <br>  In general, I think, the real pros are distinguished, including the ability to approach their favorite work with humor, and this ability was demonstrated by all MailCon speakers, which allowed them to perceive a huge amount of information and not get tired. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/034/bf6/2e7/034bf62e78c54433a3d6ac5abc22eaa8.png"><br>  Beautiful from Oleg: "Properly chosen time to send, the Open Rate doubles." <br><br>  The report of Dmitry Pivovarov (E96) was called ‚ÄúEmail Marketing for 400 Million‚Äù and was devoted to the peculiarities of working with large databases: which types of mailings are the most conversion and whether it is necessary to build chains of letters.  A lot of insights from personal experience, and, by the way, the headline is not about how much it cost the company to introduce email marketing, but about how much it brought. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9a2/28e/64f/9a228e64f5564026aaf7bd9a0e6b2460.jpg"><br>  Beautiful from Dmitry: "We ourselves did not expect that email-marketing works so well."

      The topic of working with large databases was continued by Andrei Sas (Badoo), noting that the value of email marketing is often underestimated, and after all, with millions of subscribers, even minor improvements give a very big result.  Andrei advised management of companies to strictly control mailings, even if they are not about sales and hire their own programmers to work on mailings.  A separate conversation was about push notifications as an important channel of communication with customers. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f65/a2e/0f3/f65a2e0f3a0444fbbcc73462a097a6f0.jpg"><br>  Beautiful: "Delivery of letters should (guaranteed) take seconds, not more." <br><br>  To name the best would be difficult, but the worst - I will take it.  The first part of the report from Mail.ru was not informative, the speaker obviously didn‚Äôt take into account that there were no newbies in the hall, and they don‚Äôt need to retell the FAQ, and in a tone like ‚Äúspammers you are all here‚Äù.  What is there a report, with such a position in relation to customers in general can not work in support.  The second part of the Mail.ru report was more interesting, Alexander talked about how spam is determined, how dangerous affiliate programs are and why one cannot assume that the subscriber is yours forever. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2d8/a40/24f/2d8a4024f7364191adaefbfeb50473a4.jpg" width="660"><br>  He told about the case, it is interesting, but in general, "sediment somehow remained."  Beautiful from Alexander: "The user is always right, even if he pressed" In spam! "By mistake." <br><br>  Leonid Nikolaev (Get-N-Post) focused on the deliverability of letters.  Anyway, this topic has been touched on by almost all speakers, because this is one of the main problems - how to make sure that letters are always delivered, quickly, do not get into spam, and how to check your subscriber base for validity.  There are a lot of technical issues, but again, it‚Äôs clear with humor, and where are we going from technical things? We are IT, in fact ... <br>  Leonid continued his story at the master class the next day, who did not come - bite your elbows, it was very useful. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/052/fab/f47/052fabf4702041abb964073bea8fd3c7.jpg"><br>  Beautiful from Leonid: "5% of subscribers give 90% of profit". <br><br>  Yulia Savitskaya (Mailigen), who miraculously managed to fly to Ekaterinburg, built a report around the email marketing strategy in terms of cost and time savings.  If you do not have a strategy, then all efforts are in vain, and the strategy must be unique, send everything to everyone - this is an anti-strategy, according to Julia.  There were many life hacking and emotional examples (one of personal practice with erotic overtones) and, of course, slides with cats! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/21e/e65/60c/21ee6560c22143cf9fe7967a7c682145.jpg"><br>  Beautiful from Julia: ‚ÄúPop-up window - to hate, but use!‚Äù <br><br>  Vladimir Ilyin (Banking.ru / EmailSoldiers) spoke about segmentation and what real personalization is, where and how to collect personal data of users and how to segment subscribers by activity.  Listeners thought ... <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ad1/c9d/05e/ad1c9d05ee6847b897011402e853f8b0.jpg"><br>  Beautiful from Vladimir: "If you do not have 20 segments, then you do not segment." <br><br>  Alexander Lynx (SendPulse) shared observations about the role of content, why and when it is needed, whether it is necessary to use buttons in a letter, what and why it is better to write in the ‚Äúfrom whom‚Äù column, which is important to consider when creating a preheader.  The beautiful thing from Alexander is: ‚ÄúIf you are so sure that you are brilliant, you can, of course, write‚Äú canvases ‚Äù(large texts in mailings) ... And let you be lucky ...‚Äù <br><br>  Dmitry Kudrenko (eSputnik) just blew up the hall!  He began by saying that everything that the speakers and, in particular, the organizers of this conference say, is complete bullshit and email marketing does not exist.  Not a weak bid to win! <br>  But Dmitry knew what he was doing.  105 presentation slides are an incredible amount of useful, I would call it ‚Äúemail marketing through the prism of common sense,‚Äù although in all the reports the common sense was the main thing, but Dmitry has a particular accent.  Best Practices - this is only the beginning, the pros can act and do not follow the rules, if they understand how everything works and keeps the goal in mind ... <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/05c/881/8cb/05c8818cb68245e99d441cc609105020.jpg"><br>  Dmitry generously shared his experience on coffee breaks (in the photo) and at the master class the next day.  Beautiful: ‚ÄúA bad experiment will show which option is better, and a good one ‚Äî why is it better?‚Äù <br><br>  Ivan Shkirya told the story of email marketing his Callibri company, telling how it started for them and what it came to.  Mega-interesting solutions for trigger ezines.  Vanya draws pictures himself, and if someone doesn‚Äôt say monkeys, that‚Äôs probably some kind of wrong email-marketer. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ecb/c86/0dc/ecbc860dc5174bb0962b735d34cd759c.jpg"><br>  Beautiful: "At some point, I realized that I was doing more mailings for myself." <br><br>  Roman Fadeev (Legal Jazz) explained why email marketing is threatening the law on personal data.  The novel kept the room in some tension, creating intrigue, which allowed the brilliant conclusion that there are no special threats, if you look.  If a.  Beautiful: ‚ÄúYou should have a server in Russia with a‚Äú Personal data ‚Äùpasted on it.‚Äù <br><br>  The title of this article is a quote from the post of one of MailCon's organizers, Daniel Silantyev, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ahey79/posts/10206414504139777">on Facebook</a> .  Yes, we did, yes, almost without jambs, everyone is happy, there is a lot of information to be understood.  In general, almost everything was thought out, so, in the razdatka, a promotional code was found for access to the Email-Competitors mailing list (if not now!), A pen and a notebook, the program of the conference was printed right on the first page - that's kind of a trifle ! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9c1/6d8/0f4/9c16d80f44094ec08e679f205e235fd2.jpg"><br><br>  There were probably three drawbacks to the organization, but two of them, rather, to the chosen site, Palladium.  The first and most important was that the outlets were not enough, I had to look for them first, and then a compromise with others who wanted to feed their gadgets.  It is good that everyone was polite and helpful and there were no casualties and no damage. <br>  The second important disadvantage is the poor performance of the microphone at the beginning.  Daniel was able to pump the hall with his voice, but not everyone has developed such a volume level ... And the third minus is not always the exact observance of the timing of the event.  I don‚Äôt know why, because of piety, or for whatever reason, but the report from Mail.ru, which was already given more time than others, was not interrupted on time, and as a result, after lunch, I had to speed up and less time for questions to other speakers. <br><br>  And when the time was over completely, the speakers and the organizers went to the bar, and there ... (no, not at all what you thought about Friday evening!) For a long time they discussed email marketing topics, delving into details and subtleties ... <br>  To continue the conversation on Saturday at a master class that went full time, and this day was not enough for everyone. <br><br>  In the photo - from left to right: Dmitry Bannykh (Email-Competitors, inbox Marketing), Julia Savitskaya, Leonid Nikolaev, Dmitry Kudrenko, Daniil Silantyev (inbox Marketing). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d52/6e3/ef2/d526e3ef265443cb8a8388f7ac3b0873.jpg"><br><br>  MailCon conference presentations are available by reference <a href="http://mailcon.ru/">in the program</a> . <br>  Comments and reviews can be found in social networks on the tag #mailcon. <br><br>  * the largest conference - in the opinion of participants and speakers. <br><br>  UPD: Video of the conference is available at the link <a href="http://video.mailcon.ru/">video.mailcon.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295742/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295742/</a></p>
