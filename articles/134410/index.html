  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About marketing, netbooks and CMS</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello to all! <br><br>  Blog entry is the first, and since this is exactly the company's blog and blog, I will write reflections that are interspersed with the essence of the company and its product.  :) <br><br>  I'll start from the end.  Last month trying to choose a netbook.  Well, like a netbook ... In fact, I need a portable computer that can be taken on small business trips, on trips around the city to customers.  With whom you can sit in any queue, whether it is a store in anticipation of his wife, or traffic jam.  And after all, I have requirements for a laptop with a nose!  I need the battery to keep the clock 10-12, I need a screen resolution of at least 1366, and I need a built-in 3G modem for the Internet when traveling around the region and Russia (iota only inside the Moscow Ring Road enrages, and also enrages external 3G usb whistles ) and the weight of about a kilogram, so that it was portable and got into the bag.  Everything else is not critical at all, neither the amount of usb, nor the optical drive, nor the size of the RAM. <a name="habracut"></a>  Separately, many netbooks satisfy these requirements.  But where fierce batteries up to 14.5 hours, there is no 3G.  Where there is 3G, there are unfortunate 5 hours of battery life, or the laptop weighs 2.5 kg ... It seems that Sony has found a laptop, where there is 3G, and the screen is as much as 1920 * 768 with 13 "and 1.4 kg, but the battery needs 12 hours buy separately for $ 500, and the laptop itself costs ... almost $ 4000. Of course, the price is determined by the size of the laptop, the thinnest led display, there is 8GB of RAM, a Core7 processor, even the smallest DVD drive they shoved into this mini-laptop, but I all is not necessary ... With all the variety of laptops, brands and models, I believe that the market will not be superfluous another laptop with 14 hours of work, with  1366 screen and necessarily a 3G modem and a fair price of 500-600 bucks, but not at all! Marketers of all companies persistently spread the necessary functions on different models, and you are a consumer explode! Or pay $ 4000 for a car of not very necessary gadgets ...

      I was lucky: I have been running a web-studio since 2003 and for some time we have been selling and selling our product - diafan.CMS.  And I, as a manager, can influence the marketing of our product and its characteristics.  :) If you do not tinker, the site management system can be compared with a laptop, and the CMS market with a laptop market.  Approximately a similar number of players and brands, which differ in functionality and prices, as well as marketing moves.  About a similar number of parameters that differ from each other CMS and laptops.  When we entered the CMS market three years ago, of course, we heard, ‚ÄúYyy, another CMS‚Äù, ‚ÄúBut you need it, there are others better‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe CMS market is saturated, no one else can get in ...‚Äù But I I was sure that another CMS is needed.  It is ours.  :) <br><br>  And no matter how pathetic it might sound, I wanted our CMS to be liked by the users first of all, and the business and the profit that came from entering the market was secondary.  After all, in the CMS market, the situation is similar to the notebook market: it is tense.  Either the necessary functions are scattered in different editions in cute CMS, or the full edition costs so much that you have to take a mortgage.  And when I collected the functionality of our future CMS in a bunch, I imagined myself as Santa Claus.  :) I thought that our user needs to have everything in the engine at once, without editors: news, galleries, polls, tags, newsletters, file archive, forum, question-answer, and comments , and ratings, and of course the online store with orders, baskets, import-export, and everything, everything, everything that may be required when creating a site.  It does not matter if something turns out to be superfluous, the main thing is that it does not affect the price.  It is imperative that with a basic knowledge of creating a site you can easily install and edit a CMS.  Easy to pull your design.  That's right to take your HTML as it is and scatter tags there in the right places and that's it.  Technical support from authors CMS should be indefinite and free!  And most importantly, to cost it all to a minimum.  For example, 2.000 rubles.  Just so, from the ceiling, without calculations and business plans, this small cost of a license was taken. <br><br>  And we all implemented it and released <a href="http://cms.diafan.ru/">diafan.CMS</a> in the boxed version. <br><br>  And now the third year, the number of fans of diafan.CMS is growing, and we are trying to respond to all the wishes and requests of our users.  Our main principle is people first.  Business is a relationship between people, and only then money.  The main thing in business is not to get money from the buyer, but to leave it satisfied.  Only then will he become a user, remain a buyer, and his kind energy will bring many more new buyers. <br><br>  And how can I be with a laptop, I do not know yet.  Perhaps I will not buy anything, but I will wait.  Maybe in the near future someone will launch a compact netbook on the market, where there will be a battery, a screen and a 3G modem ... :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/134410/">https://habr.com/ru/post/134410/</a></p>
