On Primorskaya metro met the organizers and pointed the way to the free bus. <br>  2. Registration is fast, handouts are useful (notepad, pen, full program and exhibition center plan). <br>  3. At the exhibition stands there are enough professional staff who could give answers to the most "technical" questions. <br>  4. Reports are conducted by qualified specialists, including many foreigners who are employees of Oracle and Sun.

      Negative: <br><br>  1. James Gosling could not attend the conference - the mood of the guys immediately fell. <br>  2. Even after the end of the official registration, people obviously distant from the entire computer world in general (grandmothers, grandfathers, soldiers, and generally strange personalities) were leaking. <br>  3. The reason for their (strangers) appearance was free food, as a result of which the amount of the latter was sharply reduced by the time of the lunch break (the grandmothers and many children were stocking up for the future). <br>  4. In the main hall, people whiled away the time as they could: they slept, played cards, kissed on the last rows. <br>  5. 1700 questionnaires were handed out at registration, upon returning the completed questionnaire, a gift was given (laptop bag or backpack).  However, the people did not understand that there would be enough gifts for everyone - as a result, for <br>  45 minutes before the distribution of gifts formed a queue of 1000+ people.  At the time of delivery of souvenirs began a terrible crush with shouts and forced intervention of the guards.  At the time, conference rooms <br>  almost empty. <br>  6. After receiving souvenirs, most of the audience went home safely. <br><br>  Neutral: <br><br>  1. A party is expected in the evening, free beer is possible - we are waiting for what this will lead to. <br><br>  04/08/2010 18:42 <br>  It just so happened that the minuses are more pluses in quantity, but I assure you not in quality. <br>  Photos and continuation tomorrow ... <br><br>  UPD: The post is written from the terminal on Open Solaris, and there is only a browser on the latter. <br><br>  <b>UPD2: As a result, the end of the evening smoothed everything (or almost all of them): the extra ones went home, the waiters breathed a sigh of relief, the garbage was tidied up, the gifts found their owners.</b>  <b>The people got their ration of drinks (kvass or beer) and food; they rolled a concert with cheerful music.</b>  <b>The atmosphere became extremely friendly and the day ended on a cheerful note.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/90414/">https://habr.com/ru/post/90414/</a></p>
