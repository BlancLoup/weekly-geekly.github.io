And, it seems, to live on and on and continue to carry the world sweet, kind, eternal - cheap calls through the Internet for everyone, but time is inexorably moving forward and, as of now, the project team has clearly caught the first signs that the model I installed a softphone-tuned-for 2 rubles to Beijing "slowly but surely entering into a recession.  Social networks and instant messengers quietly and imperceptibly do their dirty work, the client becomes whimsical and spoiled, give the client new free services and features so that this same client continues to use your service, and not vibers-facebook-vkontakty.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat is called to bring to mind the popular FMC technology, which for several years has been successfully promoted by all Russian mobile operators, has been successfully implemented as a feature in our cloud IP-PBX AltegroCloud and now is the time to offer to indulge in innovations not only to real estate agencies , but also to the most common users who do not need a virtual PBX, voice menus and call recording, who just need to call and call inexpensively. <br><br>  We reinvent the bicycle on steel, cut off all corporate functionality from SIM cards and left only pure calls, for ‚Äúcall‚Äù and no more. <br><br>  <b>It turned out "vulture with legs" in a mobile phone</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aa3/993/132/aa3993132bd54eb88344627d1632b74c.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Our former corporate SIM card, which honestly worked for realtors and couriers, is now in the service of ordinary people.  There is no virtual PBX, there are no voice menus, there are no workstations in the virtual office, SIP + GSM turned out to be in its primeval beauty: the SIM through the GSM network is tied to an account in our a-phone like a regular device and looks like a device in terms of service softphone or IP-phone, but it connects to the platform not via the Internet, but through a regular GSM network, i.e., the Internet for calls on sip-tariffs is no longer needed: you insert a SIM card into the most common mobile phone and you can call and receive incoming calls to the virtual SIP number. <br><br>  The idea lay on the surface, and its implementation did not take much time, since all switching and redirections, tsisk and avayi were set up a year ago.  Simply add a button to the user's personal account - ‚ÄúBuy a SIM card‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>In short, you can already use</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b17/54f/7e7/b1754f7e7b484f969a5c7285705004c3.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The next idea, which was simply asking for production with all its might, is the idea to give the client an option to show a non-phone number of an unnamed piece of information located in the data center in an outgoing call from our SIM card (and this number is often shown when making calls over the Internet ), and your own, dear and widely known friends and relatives, personal mobile number.  Internet telephony is becoming more and more like a regular mobile connection.  Internet for calls under the SIP tariffs is not needed, and now we show the real customer number.  The digital future embracing the Terminator has already pressed the videophone button with the number of your apartment. <br><br>  <b>We draw the right buttons in the right place.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/856/568/192/856568192bc749d0a1ba787c2bf1e13e.png" alt="image"><br><br>  We go into your personal account, click "Confirm", enter your mobile number, receive SMS, enter the code from the SMS.  Voila, now the SIM card is starting to look more and more like the most ordinary SIM card purchased in the communication salon nearby, but with interesting tariffs for calls and features for geeks. <br><br>  <b>In the dry residue we get:</b> <br><br>  - SIM card works like a regular SIM card in the phone, the Internet is not needed <br>  - when dialing a number on a SIM card, the call is transmitted via the GSM network and goes to the switch a-von <br>  - artful software redirects a call from a GSM network to a VoIP network and terminates a call through Internet telephony channels <br>  - during an outgoing call, the real mobile number of the subscriber is determined, and not the mysterious SIP gateway number <br>  - the phone with our SIM card becomes a portable sip phone, the application for calls is not necessary (and who said that applications are always good) <br><br>  It is clear that the friendship of Internet telephony and mobile communication is a topic almost inexhaustible and innovative.  We definitely do not plan to stop there and be limited to outgoing calls only.  Sip telephony now is not only cheap calls abroad, more precisely, sip telephony now is not only cheap calls abroad for a long time, it is a whole set of technologies that turns a phone call into the art of switching, services and amenities, and all this simply must be wrapped in near-mobile technology - smartphones or tablets.  In the very near future (and this can already be seen in your account in test mode) - launching the service to receive incoming calls to our SIM card: fasten the incoming virtual number to the clever FMC technology and gradually convert FMC into a real convergent product, where the mobile communication and Internet telephony cannot imagine their existence without each other. <br><br>  To be continued‚Ä¶ <br><br><cut></cut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/264239/">https://habr.com/ru/post/264239/</a></p>
