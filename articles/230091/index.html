The initial market saturation with these devices has passed, users either already possess a tablet, or are looking for models that would suit them not only in terms of performance, but also in price.  As some vendors say, low-cost tablets are now a success, inferior in performance to top-rated and often overvalued solutions from such giants as Samsung or Apple.  Various companies are represented in this segment, some of which explicitly supply cheap Chinese crafts with low build quality and a weak element base.  In this variety of models is very difficult to navigate, so tell about one inexpensive tablet company Wexler - WEXLER.TAB 8q. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f30/122/542/f30122542c995191904af7e4540acff0.png"><a name="habracut"></a>  Wexler products are well known to the Russian user, because in our market it has been present for more than 6 years.  If Wexler originally produced servers and home PCs, now its main focus is on e-books, smartphones and tablets.  Until recently, among the Wexler tablets there were no models with a non-standard screen diagonal, but demand, as we know, generates supply, and the new model WEXLER.TAB 8q has occupied a niche between 7 and 10 inches.  Why produce a non-standard model?  The fact is that modern smartphones each time more and more add to the size of the screen, so in order to compete with them, tablet manufacturers gradually began to switch to the release of 8-inch models.  In turn, WEXLER.TAB 8q is probably one of the first signs of a new segment of these devices, which may be gaining popularity in the near future. <h5>  Appearance </h5><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/43e/c5b/29f/43ec5b29fa6d755051ca08624b3ca8a7.jpg">  The box with the tablet WEXLER.TAB 8q is made in a well-recognized corporate Wexler style. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6db/80c/35f/6db80c35f908b73923830abfa18b55a2.jpg">  White background, the image of the device itself, the name of the model and the company logo - minimalism in its purest form. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1e3/a77/198/1e3a771984402e9a25737d946e8d1250.jpg"><br>  The back side of the box is also not replete with information, a brief description in three languages, certificate logos and plain background.  It should be noted that the inscriptions 3G and 8 GB highlighted in color most likely mean that other models will appear in the future, but for now the WEXLER.TAB 8q comes only with a 3G module and an internal memory of 8 GB. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bca/586/d2b/bca586d2b30a9a6d4362da4c09e45909.jpg"><br>  The side of the box contains another piece of information that the average user is unlikely to need - the MAC address, IMEI, barcode, serial number and model code name. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e7b/624/240/e7b6242408eb5288412f40c1069ce99e.jpg">  Compared with the packaging of other manufacturers who are full of abundance of information, Wexler has everything concisely and simply, so you should not be surprised at the package.  The tablet itself is neatly packed in a transparent plastic liner and fixed in a box with a small thin polyurethane insert. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fd9/f51/e54/fd9f51e546e55ed024a20bfacbf05848.jpg"><br>  In the box with the device, the user will find all the most necessary, namely: a tablet, a microUSB-USB cable, a charger, a warranty card, combined with brief instructions.  All accessories are placed under the tablet in a separate compartment. <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/563/142/8e2/5631428e2bbafa6407850a6eb15907de.jpg"></div><br>  For WEXLER.TAB 8q comes a separate charging adapter with a standard USB connector and a capacity of 2A, which allows you to use it to charge other devices - smartphones, navigators, etc. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4b7/cd8/a54/4b7cd8a5417e4568c6c2d24c44f1cea0.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3de/229/a18/3de229a1870601fc642763dbb7632d86.jpg"><br>  As a small digression, we note that Wexler supplies special cases to its tablets.  If for some 10-inch models the case is already in the kit, then it will have to be purchased separately for the WEXLER.TAB 8q.  The Wexler.SHELL 8q / 8qL case comes in a small plastic box. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f6b/b31/493/f6bb31493da06701c4c2d98eacf73df2.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f23/838/2ab/f238382ab7bc9d6c7b7cb3bed9c3c94d.jpg"><br>  The case itself is made in the corporate style - a completely gray case, a sturdy plastic back wall and a folding front part with the company logo at the bottom.  The tablet is securely held inside the case and can be removed with considerable force. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/91b/2fe/612/91b2fe612d66acbd432ca133781d57b9.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/178/839/c49/178839c49d555b18e773a3b122a0446b.jpg"><br>  The front cover can be folded in several positions to create the required angle of inclination when watching movies or working with the tablet.  It should be said that the case has a pleasant to the touch velvety non-marking surface and is comfortable to hold.  However, this is a subjective assessment, but most likely, finding a suitable case for a third-party manufacturer will be difficult, so this is the case when you should use a proprietary model.  But we digress from the topic, let's see what WEXLER.TAB 8q looks like. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b4e/da7/718/b4eda7718e5d324f3a97b73062db552c.jpg"><br>  So, on the front of the WEXLER.TAB 8q there is a small information sticker on which all the most important functions from the manufacturer‚Äôs point of view are marked.  It is easily removed and under it you can see another sticker that protects the glass tablet.  It should be noted that from the fact that the primary sticker pulls the second one after itself, small air bubbles can form on the glass.  It does not look very nice and can interfere with normal work with the tablet. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dd0/2d9/205/dd02d92053f27fd6f5567cace61b679f.jpg"><br>  The tablet, in contrast to the 10-inch counterparts, involves vertical use, since the three lower function buttons are located just under this position when working.  Of course, there is also an auto-rotate screen, then the function buttons will shift, because they are part of the touch panel.  Tablet dimensions are 202 √ó 137.6 √ó 9 mm, while it weighs only 318 g <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7fb/ff0/947/7fbff0947d297ed8e8b4fa3555f4f46d.jpg">  The lens of the main rear camera, combined with a small LED flash, is located at the top of the back of the tablet.  At the same time, it is maximally shifted to the left upper edge. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/902/779/7e8/9027797e8172fff1056a3c6998e6d327.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/14b/f57/d1c/14bf57d1c82f01667df82c7e23f4e4b5.jpg"><br>  The location of the power button and volume rocker in this model is quite standard - the left side contains the power button, and on the right is the volume control. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f54/ae1/514/f54ae1514f1b2b7c153164378226f648.jpg"><br>  On the upper edge of the device is a standard connector for headphones and headsets, as well as a special slot for opening the lid, which hides all the main slots. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/237/245/56d/23724556df8fb579e95aff202edca1bd.jpg"><br>  The lid opens with great difficulty, since the latches sit very tightly.  Even after several openings and closings of this cover, the user can be sure that this part will not fly away from the wrong movement of the hand.  Under the cover is a microSD expansion slot, SIM-card slots - one of a standard format, and the other for a Micro-SIM and a system reset / restart button recessed into the case. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/192/079/3b4/1920793b4d0f38ff8752c724957b26ee.jpg"><br>  On the bottom of the WEXLER.TAB 8q are a microUSB connector and a Mini-HDMI video output.  There are also special slots for the speaker. In general, it is impossible not to note the build quality of the tablet.  All its parts fit snugly together, no gaps or gaps.  The texture of the back cover is very interesting, it is pleasant to the touch and at the same time due to the small, almost invisible mesh, it allows you to securely hold the model in your hand, protecting it from slipping. <h5>  Hardware platform </h5><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ed6/6f8/981/ed66f8981179b4505785cce6cfcd9d5a.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e30/e23/bd2/e30e23bd2f058920596b9f2463b498db.png"><br>  But this is all the lyrics, now let's talk about the technical characteristics of this model.  It is based on the SoC Mediatek MTK8382, four cores (Cortex A7) of which operate at a maximum effective frequency of 1.3 GHz.  This is a relatively new platform introduced last year, and some of the tablets and phones on it can be found on sale from the new year.  The processor cores can be disabled to reduce power consumption, and their frequency varies depending on the load.  In general, the new SoC MTK8382 has good energy efficiency and at the same time allows to achieve very good performance in applications. As a graphics card, this tablet uses the Soi-integrated 2-core Mali 400MP2 chip, which has long proven itself as a reliable and proven solution.  The tablet's RAM is 1 GB DDR3.  This is not very much by modern standards, but on the other hand it is enough for most applications and games represented in the Play Market.  As the drive uses a chip of 8 GB.  Part of the system memory is occupied by the operating system and installed applications, so the user can use a little more than 5 GB, which are allocated in a separate area.  Increasing the amount of memory is made by installing a microSD memory card in the appropriate slot.  The built-in card reader supports SDHC microSD cards with a maximum capacity of 32 GB.  It is impossible to ignore the capacitive screen used in this model.  Compared to other 8-inch tablets, this model has a more flattened screen, so it seems a bit square, but at the same time more compact.  The display is made using tempered glass, and its diagonal is 7.85 ". It is based on a contrast IPS-matrix with a resolution of 1024x768. The matrix has good viewing angles and bright backlighting, which guarantees reading the text on a bright sunny day. Of course, the resolution is todays the standards are not so impressive, but in this case we can talk about the balance of the video adapter-processor-screen solution. Like all tablets, the WEXLER.TAB 8q supports connecting to wireless networks and clients via Wi-Fi (802.11 b / g / n 2.4 GHz) and Bluetooth 4.0. In addition, this  The model can install up to two active SIM-cards and work in modern 3G networks.It should be noted that in addition to surfing the Internet itself, it can also be used as a regular phone, but due to its size this type of use seems unlikely. It has a built-in GPS module with support for A-GPS, which allows it to be used as a navigator with the update of current information about traffic jams. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d6d/735/aa7/d6d735aa7f04255423aff997b75d4d96.jpg">  The rear and front cameras of this tablet have a resolution of 5 and 0.3 MP, respectively.  If the front camera is more suitable for video conferencing, then the rear camera can be used to create good shots due to the additional LED flash and functions like autofocus and HDR.  However, in order to achieve a good result, you need to adjust the settings a bit, as the auto mode does not always correctly determine the type of external lighting. WEXLER.TAB 8q has a 4000 mAh non-removable lithium polymer battery, which occupies most of the inside of the tablet.  The manufacturer does not provide information about the autonomous operating time, but apparently, it is about 7 hours in the mode of average load (watching video, Internet-reading books). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fac/2b2/970/fac2b2970b534e7bddea1b37b96383ea.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/632/4ff/488/6324ff48855c973907b983d8b030caf9.png"><br>  The tablet WEXLER.TAB 8q is running Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean with the ability to update using the Wexler proprietary installer (current version 1.04).  Wexler uses stock firmware, complementing it with several popular third-party programs ‚Äî the Kingsoft Office office suite, Navitel navigator, Evernote, and ivi.ru services.  Yandex.Disk and Opera.mini browser. (Insert image Wexler.Play.png) In addition, the tablet has branded Wexler Play applications.  This small utility, accessible from the main menu, is a catalog of popular Android applications with the ability to quickly navigate to the desired application page on Google Play and its subsequent installation.  As can be seen from the picture presented, those applications that are already installed on the phone are displayed in Wexpler.Play with a colored icon.  Everything looks quite concise, but at the same time beautiful and comfortable.  It is worth noting that this interface, compared with the newfangled own developments of other manufacturers, works very quickly and responsively. <h5>  Test results </h5><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/50d/23e/d0c/50d23ed0c83f4a7ca17e085e8fe8e791.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d39/d9b/065/d39d9b06557436c365655d06630d5111.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3ea/8b8/245/3ea8b824545f22bb1feb93292ad27f57.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/565/6d3/19d/5656d319d39493f047e8217ba420797d.png"><br>  As for tests, we launched the already standard AnTuTu Benchmark test and the 3Dmark graphic test.  As you can see, the hardware platform of this model can hardly be called high-performance, but on the other hand, the choice of components is quite balanced.  According to the test AnTuTu Benchmark, WEXLER.TAB 8q CPU bypasses most smartphones, but in 3D-graphics inferior to many market players.  Among the advantages of the tablet, we note a built-in display with good color reproduction and a convenient aspect ratio.  If the 8-inch screen is not enough, you can connect the tablet to a TV or other playback equipment via the HDMI output.  It is impossible not to draw attention to the thoughtful design and thoroughness of the assembly.  The rounded corners of the case, the comfortable profile of the sidewalls, the pleasant to the touch and the non-marking surface of the rear panel - all this is pleasing to the eye and ensures the comfort of the user.  You also can not ignore the corporate case for this model, which provides reliable protection of the tablet during transport.  Among the main drawbacks of WEXLER.TAB 8q, it is worth noting the not very high resolution of the main camera and the very mediocre graphics core performance.  This model will perfectly cope with the role of home access to the Internet and a universal portable media player, as well as e-book readers.  Due to the integrated 3G and GPS modules, this model can be used as a navigator, since an 8-inch screen is best suited for this work, and the choice of the operator will save money when traveling long distances. </div>
