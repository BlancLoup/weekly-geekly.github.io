Obviously, to consider a set of objects that do not interact within the network, even if they have access to it, does not make much sense.  Therefore, it is the process of communication between objects that is important.  But such a process is possible only in conditions where things ‚Äúunderstand‚Äù each other, and this means that things must be located in a single technological network. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b60/e42/fed/b60e42fed2304f75a80ea95b37282a9f.png">

      We continue to deal with the benefits of the Internet of Things for Business.  Now consider what things are involved in Internet communication, what roles they have been assigned and what abilities things should show on the network.  At the same time, we do not forget about the correctly set goal for the Internet of Things project. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <i>Internet of things for business objects - all parts:</i> <br><ul><li>  <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/25334/">Part 1.

Business objects: new technologies - Advantages.</a>  <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/25594/">Perspectives.</a> </li></ul><br><br><h1>  THE INTERNET OF THINGS: NEW OPPORTUNITIES </h1><br><h2>  3 things </h2><br>  The Internet of Things involves the following types of objects in transactions: <br><ul><li>  <b>a physical object</b> is a physically separated <i>thing</i> , which is identified and participates in the interaction as a separate integral unit, representing a separate material object; </li><li>  <b>virtual object</b> - a logically-isolated <i>thing</i> , which is identified and participates in the interaction as a separate integral unit, representing a certain selected part of a material object or a combination of several material objects (their parts); </li><li>  <b>the control object</b> is a functionally isolated <i>thing</i> that is identified and participates in the interaction as a separate unit representing an ordered target changing set of functions of one or several physical or virtual objects (their parts). </li></ul><br>  In addition, each thing on the Internet implements in relation to another (considers the behavior of another thing as realizing) one of the following roles: <br><ul><li>  A user of an item ( <b>active contact</b> ) is a physical user or some thing that gives a direct indication of performing operations with information or performing other specific actions. </li><li>  The thing of direct interaction ( <b>direct contact</b> ) is the thing with which interaction is established within the framework of a direct separate communication (physical or virtual communication line). </li><li>  A thing that provides access to other things of the network ( <b>access provider</b> ) is a thing with which interaction has been established within the framework of a separate connection and which should provide indirect interaction with other things within the network. </li><li>  The thing of mediated interaction ( <b>network contact</b> ) is the thing with which interaction is established through some intermediary, which can be direct contact, access provider or other network contact). </li><li>  A thing outside the target interaction area ( <b>out-of-contact</b> ) is a thing that enters the network within which the interaction takes place, but does not participate in the interaction.  It is not in the user's field of view, but it is present on the network. </li></ul><br>  Depending on the role that implements things in a particular executable communication scenario, mutual communication with established levels of regulation, control and trust should be appropriately provided.  In addition, the implementation of a particular role may determine the dependence on the standards, protocols and regulations for the exchange of transactions used. <br><br>  The interaction of things within the Internet is possible provided that things <b>are able</b> (capable) ...: <br><ol><li>  ... are able to <b>participate in the interaction</b> , and therefore are able to: <br><ul><li>  To be identified </li><li>  Store (accumulate) own state (attributes) </li><li>  Monitor the state of the environment </li></ul><br></li><li>  ... are able <b>to perform the assigned tasks</b> , and therefore are able to: <br><ul><li>  Ensure the integrity of their own and their behavior </li><li>  Monitor target settings </li><li>  Organize your own actions (build algorithms) </li></ul><br></li><li>  ... know how to <b>function</b> , which means they can: <br><ul><li>  Accept requests (input information) </li><li>  Understand and process requests (internal information) </li><li>  Generate requests and responses (output) </li></ul><br></li></ol><br>  An ability should be understood as the ability to correctly and predictably, in accordance with accepted standards, regulations or protocols to store and process information, as well as to perform certain intended actions. <br>  A skill, in this case, is the ability with which a thing is endowed or which it was able to learn. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/76e/07a/d59/76e07ad5991a47c3b6e3bda917eda57c.png"><br><br>  In order for things to be able to do on the Internet, the above are necessary: <br><ol><li>  <b>Standards (regulations, protocols, formats) interactions</b> <br><ul><li>  <b>Interaction format</b> - determines the method of transmission, type and medium </li><li>  <b>Interaction logic</b> - defines the principles of structural construction of transmitted information </li><li>  <b>Interaction algorithm</b> - determines the behavior of interacting objects, depending on the transmitted information </li></ul><br></li><li>  <b>Interaction goals</b> <br><ul><li>  <b>The formulation and description of the goals and objectives of the interaction</b> - determines and correctly describes the goals and objectives to be obtained from the results of the interaction </li><li>  <b>Monitoring and adjustment of goals</b> - determines the ways and possibilities to monitor the achievement of goals and objectives, as well as to correct them (make changes) if necessary </li><li>  <b>Linking the goals of interaction</b> - defines the mutual coordination of goals and objectives of the interacting object in the total population, as well as in accordance with the declared goals and objectives of other objects </li></ul><br></li><li>  <b>Interaction management</b> <br><ul><li>  <b>Interaction regulation</b> - defines a joint orderly implementation of the functionality of objects in the network in a competitive environment for resources </li><li>  <b>Ensuring security of interaction</b> - defines ways of securely interdependent implementation of functionality for objects in the network and the network itself </li><li>  <b>Interaction control</b> - defines the rules and procedures for internal and external control of the correctness and integrity of the interaction of objects in the network </li></ul><br></li></ol><br>  Standards are of particular importance for the smooth operation of the network as a whole and for the objects to correctly perform their functions within network communications. <br><br><h2>  4. Purpose </h2><br>  From a practical point of view, it‚Äôs worth considering the Internet of Things project only when the goal of its construction and functional existence is defined. <br><br>  The Internet of Things owes its rise and development to the quantitative and qualitative diversity of information flows and permanently connected or temporarily connecting devices to the network.  But on the other hand, it is this mass character that sharply necessitates the adequate implementation of the target factor when managing things on the network.  Without a clear understanding of the strategic goal and the tactical objectives that reveal it, it is impossible to design, organize and execute meaningful interaction of things on the infinitely branched and connected Internet. <br><br>  The formulation and implementation of a specific goal in relation to a limited number of things that should develop and maintain active interaction for some time is the basis for obtaining the desired result.  The purpose of the IoT project is to determine: <br><ol><li>  The circle involved in the interaction of things network </li><li>  Applicable to things and their interaction standards, protocols, regulators, security levels, etc. </li><li>  Duration and sustainability of communication things </li><li>  The target zone, which will be virtually or virtually isolated in the network </li><li>  The quality and quantity of the result obtained from communication of things (including information) </li><li>  Used technical and technological tools, techniques and tools </li><li>  Ways to Organize the Internet of Things Project Management </li></ol><br>  Correctly set goal allows to organize the project of the Internet of Things in a relevant and objective way and get qualitative results on it in a timely manner. <br><br>  <i><a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/25514/">(continuation - Part 3.
