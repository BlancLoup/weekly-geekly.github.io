      Now let's look at each type and illustrate it with a series of famous examples. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Serial entrepreneurs </h3><br><br>  Serial entrepreneurs know how to earn money, select the best people and promote their company to the acquisition of another company or the initial placement of shares on the stock market.  Investors simply adore them, and are ready to give them money, because they are sure that he, or her, will succeed again.  Note that most serial entrepreneurs are also investors at the same time. <br><br>  <strong>Niklas Zennstrom and Janus Friis</strong> <br><br>  Kazaa, Skype and now Joost.  Having destroyed companies that have been developing for decades, and having changed how we use our computers through P2P technology, the North European stars have not calmed down.  Their latest venture, Joost, a television Internet service, received funding of $ 45 million from serious venture capital firms like Sequoia Capital. <br><br>  <strong>Marc andreesen</strong> <br><br>  He founded Netscape, and now travels in the same webdvane sled along with Ning - a social networking network.  Follow his exciting blog <a href="http://blog.pmarca.com/">http://blog.pmarca.com</a> . <br><br>  <strong>Joe kraus</strong> <br><br>  Does anyone say anything?  JotSpot became his second venture, subsequently bought by Google for an unknown amount.  So Joe is now a googler.  But I suspect that a new idea may soon spark a thirst for a new startup in it. <br><br>  <strong>Mark fletcher</strong> <br><br>  His first successful ONEList business became part of Yahoo in 1999, but this was not enough for him - he then organized Bloglines, bought by Ask. <br><br>  <strong>Reid hoffman</strong> <br><br>  Former member of the board of directors of Paypal, but now he is preparing for, must be, the largest public offering in the era of Web 2.0 (unless, of course, Facebook does not speak either) with its professional network LinkedIn. <br><br>  <strong>Pierre chappaz</strong> <br><br>  The founder of the engine for comparing store prices <a href="http://www.kelkoo.com/">Kelkoo</a> , which has become the largest hit in Europe, after it was bought by Yahoo.  He currently runs <a href="http://www.wikio.com/">Wikio</a> , a mix of Digg and a search engine aimed at the European public. <br><br><h3>  The dreamers </h3><br><br>  Dreamers are very well versed in this business, but pursue other dreams and are exposed to other risks.  As a rule, they leave the Internet business and begin to engage in research projects.  As for financing, they are not so lucky here as their fellow entrepreneurs are serial entrepreneurs - they usually need government grants, since the possibility of returning funds is much lower here. <br><br>  <strong>Elon musk</strong> <br><br>  From the Internet to space.  His new goal is to conquer space with his new company, <a href="http://spacex.com/">SpaceX</a> , which recently <a href="http://crunchgear.com/2007/03/20/spacex-successfully-launches-falcon-1-rocket/">launched a successful rocket launch into space</a> . <br><br>  <strong>Martin roscheisen</strong> <br><br>  One of the founders of eGroups.  Now he works in the field of "green" energy in his solar energy company <a href="http://nanosolar.com/">NanoSolar</a> . <br><br>  <strong>Marc cuban</strong> <br><br>  Started with broadcast.com (purchased by Yahoo for several billions), and now leads the NBA team Dallas Mavericks.  Well, this does not apply to science, but it is definitely a dream come true! <br><br>  <strong>Carl Page</strong> <br><br>  Older brother of one of the founders of Google Larry Page (Larry Page).  Karl not only helped his brother build Google, he was also among the founders of eGroups, bought by Yahoo.  He now holds the position of Chief Technical Officer at <a href="http://www.hheld.com/">HandHeld Entertainment</a> , a company operating in the portable entertainment gadget industry. <br><br>  <strong>Trevor blackwell</strong> <br><br>  He launched a company called <a href="http://anybots.com/">AnyBots</a> , engaged in humanoid robots in his quiet office in Mountain View.  He also co-founded Viaweb, also sold to Yahoo. <br><br>  <strong>Mark Shuttleworth</strong> <br><br>  His new goal is Bill Gates and Microsoft.  South African, the founder of SSL certification company Thawte (now Verisign), is currently leading the <a href="http://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> project, the first Linux-based operating system included with Dell computers. <br><br>  <strong>Michael Robertson</strong> <br><br>  Like Mark Shuttleworth, he also handles operating systems.  Founder of mp3.com (purchased by French Vivendi Universal).  He is currently leading a controversial Linux company that has caused much controversy, <a href="http://linspire.com/">Linspire</a> . <br><br>  <strong>Sabeer bhatia</strong> <br><br>  Founder of Hotmail (acquired by Microsoft for $ 400 million).  Today he is trying to restore Silicon Valley in India called <a href="http://www.nanocity.in/">Nano City</a> . <br><br><h3>  Assistants </h3><br><br>  Perhaps this is the longest list, because almost every venture company in its staff has one or several successful entrepreneurs.  However, we limit ourselves to just a few examples.  These people, instead of focusing on one company and one idea, share their experience and money with new entrepreneurs, receiving shares in return. <br><br>  <strong>Peter thiel</strong> <br><br>  Together with Ken Howery and Luke Nosek, founders of Paypal, now heads the venture capital firm <a href="http://www.thefoundersfund.com/">Founders' Fund</a> , which has already invested in <a href="http://facebook.com/">Facebook</a> , <a href="http://geni.com/">Geni</a> , <a href="http://powerset.com/">Powerset</a> and <a href="http://slide.com/">Slide</a> . <br><br>  <strong>Paul Graham</strong> <br><br>  Helps young entrepreneurs participating in his Y Combinator program.  His successful investments include <a href="http://iminlikewithyou.com/">iminlikewithyou</a> , <a href="http://reddit.com/">reddit</a> , <a href="http://scribd.com/">Scribd</a> and <a href="http://justin.tv/">Justin.TV</a> . <br><br>  <strong>Josh kopelman</strong> <br><br>  He founded half.com and sold it to eBay.  Now manages <a href="http://www.firstround.com/">First Round Capital</a> - an investment company that invests in projects at their initial stage, already has a decent portfolio, including Wikia, OpenAds, Powerset and Riya. <br><br><h3>  Permanent </h3><br><br>  Permanent, as a rule, are those who have achieved success and brought their company to the initial public offering.  For example, Jeff Bezos founded Amazon.com, and today runs the company.  Like him, Pierre Omidyar is the founder and chairman of eBay‚Äôs board of directors.  But, interestingly, they also fuel their passion for new technologies by investing young companies.  For example, Bezos invested in <a href="http://37signals.com/">37Signals</a> , and Omidyar‚Äôs firm in <a href="http://socialtext.com/">SocialText</a> . <br><br>  It rarely happens that the founder of the purchased company remains in it.  Scott Shambarger, who worked for eGroups, is still working with Yahoo.  Sometimes, as in the case of MySpace, the founders of a purchased company may <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2007/06/27/myspace-unveils-youtube-equivalent-founders-demand-more/">require</a> substantial compensation in order to stay in their new company. <br><br><h3>  Conclusion </h3><br><br>  For none of these entrepreneurs, money is not the only motivation.  In the end, there are safer and more profitable ways to make money.  It seems to me that one can only explain their ongoing investments and entrepreneurship by a desire for new technologies and creation. <br>  All these people are engaged in what they think they are good at and what can make our life better.  Perhaps this is the main condition for a successful business.  If your motivation is based on a vacation in the Caribbean, then you have chosen the wrong path.  It seems that the passion for technology makes our heroes come back again and again. <br><br>  In <a href="http://www.diggreader.ru/">my blog</a> with photos. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/31154/">https://habr.com/ru/post/31154/</a></p>
