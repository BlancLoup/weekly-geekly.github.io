The participants had the task to write the code during the day and create a project that was presentable to the public from the original idea. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/538/01b/a2f/53801ba2fdcf2bb1706bd3070e6e5434.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It all started with an idea.  The participants of the ‚Äúhackathon‚Äù were invited to express their ideas on creating a program that is useful or just interesting for the general public.  As it turned out, the crowd accumulated a lot of ideas that they sought to bring to life.  The press center was attended by those who have been working on their own projects for a long time, and those who have only certain achievements.  For example, the project, called ‚ÄúGive a colleague a lift‚Äù to the workers, suggests that users install the application and help co-workers reach the home or office.  A project offering the creation of interactive children's books for the iPad was presented at the ‚Äúhackathon‚Äù.  There were enough ideas in the hall that were born to those who came in just a few minutes.  Enthusiasts offered to create an application that could simplify the maintenance of their own tape of interesting events, develop a program that would make any control panel universal and much more.  After the projects were selected, a team was assembled for each of them and the work began to boil.

The programmers gathered in the IT park exchanged experiences, argued, joked, ate pizza and, of course, wrote the code.  During the night of intensive work, we managed to bring to mind about six projects, which were presented on Sunday morning.  Of course, one cannot say that the participants of the ‚Äúhackathon‚Äù turned out to be ready for the immediate launch of the application, but the guys showed their talent and professionalism.  The participants discussed each project, expressed their opinions, suggested ways for its development in the future.  Moreover, the event became the platform on which the formation of the Kazan IT community continues.  Communities of young and talented programmers who are ready to work on the most complex and ambitious projects and promote the high-tech industry.  The ‚Äúhackathon‚Äù days turned out to be productive, and each of the participants left Kazan IT Park with something new - with a new friend, experience, idea.  As international experience shows, programming marathons can last more than one day, reaching up to a week.  In the future, Kazan programmers expect new interesting tasks within the hackathons of the IT park. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/191340/">https://habr.com/ru/post/191340/</a></p>
