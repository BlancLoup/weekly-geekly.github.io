It would be very interesting to see how our community will respond to this news. <br>  Sources <a href="http://www.cybersecurity.ru/news/62132.html">www.cybersecurity.ru</a> and <a href="http://www.newsland.ru/News/Detail/id/330294/cat/65/">www.newsland.ru</a> <br>  I believe that all copyrights and rules I kept. <br>  The article itself: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c5a/cdd/8b8/c5acdd8b8c0c97e5b7bb2e68a448907d.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Russian-speaking users of Firefox expect innovation: future versions of the browser with Russian localization will refuse Google search as a standard solution for processing requests and will use only Yandex.  For users of all versions of Firefox, previously, the default search engine, starting with version 2.0, was Google. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  According to Harvey Anderson, Mozilla Corp. General Legal Counsel, starting with version 3.1 of Firefox, the Russian localization of the browser will be transferred to Yandex.  ‚ÄúIt was decided that Yandex is the best solution in this case,‚Äù says Anderson. <br><br>  The release of the new version of Firefox 3.1 is scheduled for February 2009, although it was originally planned to release it at the end of 2008.  Firefox 3.1 will include new features such as XMLHttpRequest (XHR) support, API functions for JavaScript and some other scripting languages ‚Äã‚Äãfor transferring data in XML and other formats.

      ‚ÄúOver the past few months, we have listened to the comments of our localizers, talked with them.  In particular, we studied the development trends of the specialized build of Firefox Yandex and studied the user experience of the Yandex team.  All these actions led us to the conclusion that Russian users really want to get direct access to Yandex search services in the official build of Firefox RU, ‚ÄùAnderson said. <br><br>  Meanwhile, according to users of Firefox, polled by CyberSecurity.ru, Mozilla here is to a certain extent disingenuous.  Despite the fact that the quality of the search capabilities of Yandex and Google is by no means equivalent, the respondents say, unfortunately, it is often not the Russian search engine that produces better results, but its international competitor.  In part, these data confirm the statistical results.  According to comScore MediaMetrix, in November 2008, the share of Yandex accounted for 62.4% of the search queries of Runet, for the same period, the share of Google accounted for more than 35% of requests, however, in less than 2008, the share of Google grew by almost 8% while as Yandex for the same period of its position almost did not change. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe third beta version of Mozilla will be released on January 13, in a few weeks the final version of Firefox 3.1 will appear, where Yandex will become the standard search provider for Russian localization,‚Äù they say in Mozilla. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b61/c94/c38/b61c94c3819b00391379c588087b054f.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Nevertheless, users and third-party developers on the Mozilla Bug Tracker resource believe that Yandex simply became a kind of bargaining chip in the spoiled relationship of Mozilla and Google.  It is a well-known fact that up to 85% of the finances received to the Mozilla accounts for developing Firefox came from Google, however, after the latter released the Google Chrome browser, the relationship between Mozilla and Google was noticeably complicated. <br><br>  Mozilla Chief Executive John Lilly says that over the past few years his company's cooperation with Google has been ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù, but since the release of the Google Chrome browser, the relationship has become much more complex.  ‚ÄúWe had a good and solid relationship, but I would have lied if I said that recently they have not become more complicated,‚Äù he says. <br><br>  Lilly says that everything was clear and logical on the market until September 2008 ‚Äî Apple Safari, Opera, Internet Explorer and Firefox existed.  Each of these browsers had its own support.  Behind the open browser Firefox was largely Google.  However, with the release of Google Chrome, the situation got confused - Google was actually in a situation of supporting a competing solution, and Mozilla was in a situation where the company could lose its main sponsor. <br><br>  The company says that even if Google refuses to sponsor, the company will not turn off the development, it‚Äôs just likely that their speed will be reduced until new major sponsors express a desire to support the company. <br><br>  Regarding the upcoming 2009, John Lilly says that Moziila has two major goals - the release and development of Mozilla Firefox 3.1 and the release of the mobile version of Firefox for Linux and Windows Mobile.  "In any case, for the time being we will remain competitive, because this issue must be solved by users," the head of Mozilla said. <br><br>  Here is the actual article.  And what will be your opinion: will Mozilla, with no Google support, lag behind the main players in the browser market, including Chrome?  Will successful browser development continue?  Please speak out! <br><br>  Sources <a href="http://www.cybersecurity.ru/news/62132.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.newsland.ru/News/Detail/id/330294/cat/65/">here</a> <br>  I believe that all rights are respected. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/49485/">https://habr.com/ru/post/49485/</a></p>
