Theft. </h4><br>  It was in early July, I sit at the computer, the WM Keeper is running, I don‚Äôt touch anyone, suddenly the Windows shutdown screen appears and nothing happens ... I thought at first that the update downloaded and installed, didn‚Äôt touch.  As a result, I turned it off and only turned it back on in the evening and with horror I discovered that 250WMZ was missing, transferred to an unknown wallet with a note ‚Äúbudenovka‚Äù. <br><br>  As luck would have it, a couple of days before the license of my antivirus ran out.  The point is clear - they stole it with the help of a trojan.  What to do xs - I write in webmoney support, they say, stolen, a trojan, what to do.  At the same time, I found how to block an intruder‚Äôs wallet for a day (costs 5 bucks, then returns).  I get the answer on the next.  the day that they say, check the security settings, you probably had a trojan on your computer.  Great answer.  The blocking by this time has already ended.  I am writing again and I already know that you can file a lawsuit in arbitration.

    <h4>  Chapter Two  Certificate. </h4><br>  Filing a claim costs 10% of the stolen amount (ie, 25WMZ).  And it is not known whether the money will be returned or whether it is even more from the attacker.  The trial begins, both WMIDs block (only for outgoing operations), the defendant does not appear.  I ask the arbitrators if it makes any sense to continue the lawsuit, maybe there is no money on that wallet.  To which I get the answer ‚ÄúThere are funds in the defendant‚Äôs wallet‚Äù.  I pay a lawsuit (you can don‚Äôt do it right away) and then the most fun begins - to continue the proceedings, I must have a personal certificate.)) <br><br>  To get a personal certificate, you need to specify in the WMID profile reliable data about yourself (including passport data), then pay the 10WMZ fee and send a notarized statement to Moscow with a copy of your passport.  After that, a certificate will be issued within 1-2 months. <br><br>  Here I was encouraged by a new surprise.  In my WMID data I indicated the left ones (I simply hammered the abracadabra during registration), and only the trace can be changed to correct them (more precisely, the first and the last names).  to register a new WMID with the correct data, get a personal passport for it, then write and send a notarized application for data change.)) And then the old WMID will be tied to the personal passport of the new WMID.  Both statements can be sent simultaneously. <br><br>  On the 20th of July I wrote both statements, assured them notarially on the second attempt (there were blots in the first one), after serving the queues and paying something around 400 rubles, and sent to the Moscow office of Webmoney. <br><br><h4>  Chapter three  Return. </h4><br>  I waited a couple of weeks, after I wrote just in case whether the documents were received - they say they were received, but there are no passport copies, then I sent scans by email and on August 12 they issued a certificate for a new WMID, and on August 17 they tied an old WMID to a certificate, I immediately notified the arbitration. <br>  The next response on the lawsuit appeared on September 25, but was closed for viewing (as it turned out later, there was a vote of the arbitrators on the lawsuit).  And before that, I wrote in arbitration, and created tickets in support, with a question of when at least some progress would be made, but no one answered me. <br>  On October 9, finally, a new message appeared " <i>A request was submitted to the certification center for the transfer of control over the defendant's WMID to the claimant</i> ."  and opened to view the previous message, such content: <br><br>  <i>Voting: Dear referees.</i>  <i>I propose to complete the trial of this lawsuit.</i>  <i>To recognize the defendant guilty and transfer control over the defendant's WMID to the plaintiff.</i>  <i>The defendant is denied service. Results: Pros: 2 Contra: 0</i> <br><br>  On this lawsuit closed. <br><br>  In the meantime, my WMID is still blocked, all this time it has received funds that I could not dispose of.  Posted in support - unblocked.)) <br><br>  On October 13, I received a letter from WM keeper light with a one-time (and it is written) link to restore access to an intruder‚Äôs wallet.  I opened this link in the opera, the registration process started, and in the end the system gave me - your browser is not supported.  I tried it in IE - it hangs at the ActiveX startup stage. <br><br>  I decided that the link was no longer working and wrote to send a new one ... within a week no one answered, then I wrote to arbitration and those.  support to send the link again.  Finally I phoned in support and found out that the link was working, but my browsers were simply not configured.  I set up, got access, my money is (250 bucks and some more pennies), I try to translate, I write an error: " <i>Error: Incorrect identifier of the correspondent</i> " <br><br>  I am writing to the support, after a few hours they answer that they were allowed to make a transfer from the respondent‚Äôs purse to the claimant‚Äôs purse.  Translation.)) <br><br>  That's the way I returned the stolen money. <br><br>  Expenses: <br>  $ 25 suit <br>  $ 10 certificate <br>  ~ 400r notary + print application + cost of sending a letter <br><br>  Total about 1500 rubles, a lot of nerves and 3.5 months of waiting. <br><br>  The moral is that honest users are very desirable to have a personal certificate, because  in case of any problems, this will help save a lot of time and nerves.  On the other hand, you cease to be anonymous and, as a result, you may have problems with the tax inspection, and even other state.  organs. <br><br>  <b>UPDATE</b> : If Webmoney was stolen from you, the first thing you need to do is file a claim to arbitration ( <a href="http://arbitrage.webmoney.ru/">arbitrage.webmoney.ru</a> ) on WMID where the money went, after that it will be possible to block the attacker's WMID for a day for a pledge of 5 WMZ (returned when the lock ends). <br>  Then you need to file a claim to arbitration with a description of the situation (while you don‚Äôt need to pay anything and the Persian certificate is also not needed yet) and ask them if ‚ÄúThere is money on the intruder‚Äôs wallets‚Äù, if there are no funds, then you‚Äôll hardly be able to return it - pay the claim (10% of the amount), get the pers.  certificate (if not yet) and wait. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/75533/">https://habr.com/ru/post/75533/</a></p>
