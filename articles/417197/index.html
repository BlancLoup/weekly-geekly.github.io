Less than a day later, as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.10196v1">they and their colleagues reported</a> the discovery of unprecedented substructures throughout the galaxy: ‚ÄúForms in the form of arches, snail shells and mountain ranges,‚Äù they wrote, each of which gives hints of the mysterious past of the Milky Way. <br><br>  The work of Anthoy is one of the whole work flow, which began after the long-awaited second data output from the Gaia satellite launched in 2013, and has since marked the location, brightness and colors of 1.7 billion stars of the Milky Way, as well as speeds of 1.3 billion from these stars.  (In September 2016, the satellite team released the first map, on which the location and brightness of only 1.1 billion stars were marked).  The astronomers, who previously had a catalog containing 2.5 million brightest stars in the galaxy, welcome the new era of precise astronomy.  And here are the most important discoveries made on the basis of new data. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Star streams </h2><br>  The French team applied the STREAMFINDER [Stream Search] pre-prepared algorithm to Gaia's data, and immediately found a rich network of ‚Äústar streams‚Äù moving together inside and around the Milky Way stars.  ‚ÄúThe idea is to track the movement of these flows back in time and study the past of the Galaxy and the history of its formation,‚Äù said Kiati Malkhan from the University of Strasbourg, the lead author of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.11339">work</a> describing these discoveries in the field of ‚Äúgalactic archeology‚Äù.

      The abundance of stellar streams ‚Äî which are considered consequences of gravitationally entrained small satellite galaxies and star clusters ‚Äî could potentially solve the ‚Äúproblem of missing satellites‚Äù, the question of why only about 50 satellite galaxies are observed around the Milky Way, despite the fact that simulations of galaxy formation are hundreds of them.  Another mystery is why the Milky Way satellites are in the same plane, although the simulations suggest that they should have been formed from all sides.  Malkhan and his colleagues hope to clarify or resolve this problem with the plane by ‚Äústatistical analysis of the structure and dynamics of a large set of flows‚Äù. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/17a/68b/293/17a68b2936aef1f75652b4824a4e689c.jpg"></a> <br>  <i>Star streams in the northern and southern hemisphere;</i>  <i>color denotes their flow rate.</i> <br><br>  Another group used data from Gaia for a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00425">detailed study of</a> the longest galactic flows.  Apparently, the motion of some stars was disturbed by shreds of invisible dark matter, which suggests that these streams can be used to construct a map of dark matter substructures throughout the galaxy. <br><br><h2>  Speed ‚Äã‚Äãdwarfs </h2><br>  For decades, astrophysicists have argued about the origin of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2585%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B0_Ia">type Ia supernovae</a> - explosions of stars that serve as "standard candles" for estimating space distances.  Using data from Gaia and subsequent observations from the telescope, Ken Scheen of the University of California at Berkeley and colleagues <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.11163">found convincing evidence of the</a> theory of dynamically developed double-degenerate double detonation (D6). <br><br>  Scenario D6 begins with two white dwarfs - the dense cores of dead stars, the size of a planet - located in close mutual orbit.  According to the theory, a more massive dwarf should begin to tear matter away from a less massive one, moreover so quickly and violently, that part of the helium in the transient matter explodes.  This explosion generates a carbon and oxygen explosion in a more massive dwarf, causing it to explode, generating supernova Ia.  The second white dwarf, since it is no longer holding, breaks down and flies into space with great speed. <br><br>  Among the data, Gaia Schoen and his colleagues found three "superfast white dwarfs" hurrying across the galaxy at speeds of more than 1000 km / s, which is enough to break out of its gravitational pull.  They claim that their discovery gives a ‚Äúpreliminary confirmation‚Äù of the D6 scenario.  In the letter, Sheen said that understanding the history of type Ia supernovae will reduce uncertainties in space measurements and chemical enrichment models of galaxies with supernova explosions. <br><br><h2>  Small galaxy, big black hole </h2><br>  British astronomers <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.10197.pdf">tracked the origin of</a> another superfast star, which, as it turned out, comes from the center of the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2588%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE_%25D0%259E%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE">Large Magellanic Cloud</a> , the largest satellite galaxy of the Milky Way.  And this can only mean one thing: the fact that the star was accelerated due to the sling effect, passing by the massive black hole in the center of the Large Magellanic Cloud.  In the centers of full-size galaxies, huge black holes almost always lurk, the origin of which remains a mystery.  Their presence in some small galaxies clarifies the riddle. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/29c/a34/68c/29ca3468cc2043598dc70e349e79b3f9.jpg"><br>  <i>Stars spinning clockwise around the center of the Large Magellanic Cloud, the largest galaxy of the Milky Way satellite</i> <br><br><h2>  Trouble with Hubble </h2><br>  In 1998, Adam Riesz and other astronomers, based on the distances to type Ia supernovae, suggested that the Universe expands with acceleration under the influence of "dark energy."  Interestingly, about the exact rate of expansion (known as the ‚Äú <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%258F%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25A5%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0">Hubble constant</a> ‚Äù) estimates based on supernovae differ by 8% from estimates based on light coming from the early Universe, even if we take into account the acceleration given by dark energy since then  This is one of the greatest mysteries of cosmology. <br><br>  Now Riess and colleagues used Gaia's data to more accurately measure distances to <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A6%25D0%25B5%25D1%2584%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4%25D1%258B">Cepheids</a> , which allow them to calibrate distances to type Ia supernovae.  This <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.10655">allowed them</a> to make the most accurate measurements of the Hubble constant using supernovae, which only increased the divergence of these estimates from observations of the early Universe. <br><br><h2>  Galactic revolution </h2><br>  While many researchers are studying the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.09378">diverse stellar population</a> and the dynamics of the Galaxy, Laura Watkins of the Space Research Institute using the space telescope and her colleagues have used the movements of star clusters moving in orbits in the Milky Way to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.11348">estimate the mass of the Galaxy</a> .  They say that, given the dark matter, it is about 1.5 trillion solar masses.  Joshua Simon of the Carnegie Institute of Science <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.10230">analyzed the</a> remote population of satellite galaxies, and found that all of them are now at close range in their orbits around the Milky Way.  This coincidence seems "strange", as Simon wrote in a letter.  "I do not think that we had enough time to figure out all the consequences of this result."  ‚ÄúWe know that data from Gaia will revolutionize,‚Äù added Simon.  And astronomers will reap their fruits in the next few years. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/417197/">https://habr.com/ru/post/417197/</a></p>
