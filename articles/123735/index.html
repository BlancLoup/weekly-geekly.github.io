  <section class="page js-page"><h1>HP P6000 EVA - New Virtual Disk Arrays</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/6ef6d953/f55eeb66/ba2cc617/77b83cef.jpg" align="left">  In June, new virtual disk arrays of HP P6000 EVA series were officially presented in Russia.  The presentation took place on an unexpected, but very popular venue in the premises of a nightclub on Bersenevskaya Embankment.  The speakers were Tim Pitcher from HP Storage EMEA and Vladislav Logvinenko, head of the Russian business group for the development of HP Storage.  They told a lot of interesting things about the system, crowning the ten-year work of developers to develop the EVA line. <br><br>  HP P6000 EVA, which became the subject of the presentation, is designed for small and medium-sized businesses that solve data storage and data management tasks, companies whose business requires efficient work with large amounts of data.  Previously, comparable in performance and other parameters from HP systems were affordable only for IT departments of large corporations with the corresponding budgets.  And with the advent of the HP P6000 EVA, HP's advanced storage technology is becoming available to a much wider range of companies.  When developing a product, a special focus was placed on taking into account consumer requirements and lowering the total cost of ownership.  These factors, coupled with extensive virtualization and easy administration, allow you to predict the popularity of HP P6000 EVA among HP customers around the world.  Especially considering the fact that the EVA series has tens of thousands of users. <br><br>  On the technical side, the HP P6000 EVA is a storage system represented by several modifications with capacities ranging from 240 to 480 TB.  The installation of SAS disks of the two most common form factors (2.5 and 3.5 inches) is supported, which gives users greater freedom in the choice of carriers. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Ten years of development of the EVA line have not been for the system for nothing.  The P6000 EVA embodies balanced technical and software solutions that form a productive platform with convenient and intuitive administration.  It takes approximately 30-50% less time to perform the same operations for system administrators working with HP P6000 EVA than using other manufacturers' storage systems.  Due to the use of standard components from ProLiant servers in the P6000, HP has the ability to sell new disk arrays cheaper than its competitors. <br><br>  The main interfaces supported are FibreChannel, 10 Gigabit Ethernet / FCoE and iSCSI.  The disks are connected via a 6-gigabit SAS interface, and you can use disks on 7200, 10000 and 15000 rpm in the form factors 2.5 and 3.5 inches.  HP P6000 customers are free to use the Thin Provisioning solution, which saves up to 30% of disk space.  In addition, the creation of "snapshots" (snapshots) and dynamic migration of logical drives (LUN). <br><br>  In the end, we get a system that is initially focused on transparent scaling, seamlessly integrates with HP network and server hardware and has all key HP technologies.  HP P6000 EVA comes with a wide range of software built according to the usual pattern for HP products.  Accordingly, administrators who are familiar with other HP tools should feel like a fish in water from the very first moments of working with the new system. <br><br>  Easy integration with HP server and communications products is one of the most important benefits of the HP P6000 EVA, not available to other storage manufacturers.  They just have to work in the blurry conditions to ensure compatibility with the mass of various devices, which inevitably leads to compromises.  In the case of the HP P6000 EVA, on the contrary, the scale effect is positive when the technologies effectively operating in the EVA line are used in the HP P6000 EVA.  It is the combination of all factors that makes it possible to call HP P6000 EVA an advanced industry solution in terms of mass parameters. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/123735/">https://habr.com/ru/post/123735/</a></p>
