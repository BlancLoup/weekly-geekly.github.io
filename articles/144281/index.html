  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A look into the future</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h5>  Computer Future Perspectives </h5><br><h6>  In five years </h6><br>  A man sits at a desk.  Before him is a laptop computer.  He has two mice in his hands.  Occasionally he gives abrupt concise commands with his voice: close, open, collapse, shutdown, browser. <br>  Everything is very simple.  Already, Google is introducing Internet technology to support two mice (and cursors). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/04a/c51/48a/04ac5148aea2842532ffc96f5cdf257e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Indeed, why not use two hands for surfing and working?  And faster and more useful.  As you know, the coordinated work of both hands includes the work of the two hemispheres, which leads to an increase in productivity.  Already there are voice recognition systems.  I think in the next five years, they will finally reach the masses (although I don‚Äôt understand why the computer still doesn‚Äôt talk to me ?!).  And the main commands (optional) can be performed with the help of voice.  Of course, in the conditions of office work or the noise of voice communication will have to give up. <br>  The system unit itself will continue to decrease in size, combining the functions of mobile devices and computers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h6>  After 10 years </h6><br>  A person wearing glasses (contact lenses) and with an earpiece (headset) sits in a home / office setting and occasionally speaks with someone in jerky commands.  Sometimes he knocks his fingers on a thin rug, resembling a mouse pad, which is easily folded and placed in a pencil case or pocket.  He has small clips in his nose.  There are no other visible devices nearby.

Already, some cars are installed windshields of cars, where computer information is projected ( <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%258C">augmented reality</a> ).  Soon there will be available glasses with similar glasses.  Outwardly, they will look like ordinary glasses with transparent or tinted glasses.  These glasses displace monitors.  The mice will be replaced by reading commands (moving the cursor) along the movement of the pupils.  (The current developments are currently available). <br>  For example, to open a browser it will be enough to say: ‚Äúopen browser‚Äù.  Then say the name of the site "habrakhabr."  Everything, the site is loaded.  Now the cursor follows the movement of the eyes, and when you hover over the link, it will be enough to say: ‚Äúopen‚Äù.  And the link will open in a new tab.  Or you can say the name of the link voice. <br>  However, the keyboard will still be present to enter large sized texts.  It will be a thin touch pad on which the keyboard will be displayed.  (Either the keyboard can replace the sticker stickers on the nails).  All this business will be connected among themselves by wireless channels.  Although the first time points, due to the large amount of information may be connected wired.  The system unit will be placed in the arms of glasses, or in a separate case, the size of a book.  It can be attached to the belt, or put next, hang on the neck.  In the very system will be small in terms of power elements (processor, memory, etc.).  The basis of this device will be a network card + modem, which gives access to a single Internet network, where the lion's share of information will already be stored, and <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259E%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D1%2587%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%25D1%2587%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">cloud computing</a> will be done. <br>  In addition, aroma synthesizers will be introduced on the Internet pages and media products, so that the user can finally "smell the Internet." <br>  The devices will be powered by solar panels built into the user's clothing.  In the course will be shirts, suits, jackets with solar batteries.  Either batteries that convert body heat energy into electrical energy.  Or a dynamo built into the sneakers and producing current when walking.  Since the current consumption will be minimal, and the efficiency of converters will be high, there will be enough energy for all portable devices. <br><br><h6>  After 25 years </h6><br>  The man sits, lies, goes, and on his head is a special rim. <br>  Everything is very simple.  Now, the computer will be a regular headset (from <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D1%2583%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">programmable matter</a> ) worn over the head.  The headset will be equipped with a wave receiver and an ultra-weak wave transmitter that will directly communicate with brain signals, as well as a wireless Internet modem that connects the user to the global network at high speeds.  Antenna will serve the entire human body.  In this case, no input devices will not be required, all management will be carried out at the level of thoughts. <br>  If you put this ‚Äúbezel‚Äù on your head, then you will see augmented reality: see virtual pictures superimposed on the real world, hear sounds (music) in your head, feel synthesized odors.  Human integration with the virtual world will reach its apogee.  By and large, you will be like a drug addict under a dose who sees hallucinations and can experience illusions.  However, these hallucinations will be controlled and managed.  Meaning. <br>  It is also worth noting that computers will be manufactured from biomaterials, based on living cells.  Thus, computers will actually be ‚Äúgrown in test tubes,‚Äù according to a given digital model, which means they will be safe for nature. <br><br><h5>  Computer as a bridge between realities </h5><br><img src="http://up.dvice.ru/5/1211119396.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Naturally, at this stage, a person can almost completely dive into virtual reality like a character from the film "Lawnmower".  Entire industries will emerge that will work on modeling virtual worlds.  For example, going to the cinema will be a collection of people in one place (cheaper - virtually).  Where will the film be transferred to their ‚Äúrims‚Äù (with all kinds of ‚ÄúD‚Äù - that is, with full immersion).  People get the opportunity to be present inside the film: to look at the characters from any point, through the eyes of the main characters, from the side of the auditorium.  In this case, the viewer will choose the position of the show based on their financial capabilities and desires. <br>  In the real world, the computer will become a ‚Äútransitional bridge‚Äù between two realities and civilizations: virtual and real.  Life in reality will be the lot of the elite.  And the average man in the street will live and work completely in the virtual world.  His body will be as if in a cocoon (as the film ‚ÄúThe Matrix‚Äù) save living space.  And he will go on vacation to the real world and rest.  It will be much more expensive in reality than in the world of illusions.  Yes, many people will not need it, because technology will reach such a level that it will be problematic to distinguish reality from the world of illusions. <br><br><h5>  Changes in the appearance of the real world </h5> <br>  I must say, reality itself will increasingly acquire the features of a virtual one.  Thanks to programmable matter, the outside world will become more pliable.  To some extent, all the creations of human hands in the real world will be a continuation of the virtual world.  For example, having changed the image of your car in the virtual world, you will see them on your real machine from programmable matter - the color and shape will change according to the changes in the computer model.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DnVFjJLU01GQ">Example.</a>  And you can, waking up in the morning and playing with a hologram of a virtual model of your car, find real changes in the appearance of your car (auto-flight), which is in the garage. <br>  Shops and retail space, and other buildings will go in 3D format online.  Imagine you are sitting at home on the couch, wearing a ‚Äúbezel‚Äù and, having connected over the network, and go to the 3D store, where, just like in a real store, go, choose products and put them in a basket.  Then your cart is delivered to you by the delivery service right home, or you pick it up yourself. <br>  This means hypermarkets and other food giants will play the role of entertainment centers.  And most of the goods will be delivered from the warehouse immediately to buyers home.  Therefore, trips to the hypermarket will be less.  Cars on the streets will be less.  Supermarkets, as well as other grocery stores will practically disappear from the streets of the city.  There will be only shops where you need to personally pick up the goods: try on clothes, choose gifts. <br>  The very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe workplace will change.  Real offices will replace virtual ones.  Those.  walk and ride to the real office need will disappear.  Now, wearing a ‚Äúbezel‚Äù, you can find yourself in the ‚Äúvirtual office‚Äù and work there with your colleagues: to see them and communicate with them as with real people through Internet communication.  This means that the construction of business centers will become redundant.  It will be cheaper to simulate a virtual office.  Already virtual business centers will be built.  This means the view of the cities will change.  Now all these office buildings and skyscrapers will disappear.  Cities by construction will be similar to Los Angeles (a large area and a one-story private sector).  This will lead to a more uniform distribution of population density. <br>  In addition, now outside the window of your virtual office, you can buy any landscape.  This week from the window it will be possible to observe the Pacific Ocean, and then the Eiffel Tower, the white snow of the Antarctic or the Martian landscape, and maybe Pandorsky. <br>  As for the real world, there will be, as before, branches of the economy related to the maintenance of the human body: heat, water, power supply networks, law enforcement agencies, transport, restaurants, cafes, health institutions, agriculture, etc. d.  I think that people who want to relax from the virtual world will tend to places where you can get closer to each other.  Something like coworking centers, combined with entertainment centers.  Where, leaving the "virtual" office, you can swim in the pool or stroll through the park. <br>  Since most of the life of a person will be arriving in the virtual world, people will care less about the appearance of their real bodies.  Preferring to ‚Äúpump over‚Äù virtual bodies - to buy virtual outfits, to change appearance, voice, even gender.  Naturally, you will have to pay professionals for this.  Actually a person in the virtual world can take any form.  Try on the bodies of animals, birds, change colors. <br>  In the wake of this change the understanding of the attractiveness and beauty of the human body.  The most attractive partners will be those who can afford to create the most beautiful and vibrant virtual body. <br><br>  The virtual world will lure their capabilities.  And people will become so accustomed to such a life that the ordinary world will seem to them gray and boring.  In reality, people will feel lonely and uncomfortable.  In that world, the long-cherished dream of mankind about disembodied existence is realized. <br><br>  I am attracted to the fact that the time will come when a person through the ‚Äúbezel‚Äù will be able to share his thoughts with other people over the network.  Then it will be possible to ‚Äúrecord thoughts on a dictaphone‚Äù, ‚Äúrob‚Äù your dreams and share them with others on the grid.  Telepathy will become possible over vast distances.  The need for languages ‚Äã‚Äãwill disappear, since communication will occur at the level of mental images, and not through decoded speech characters, people will communicate in a single language of thought.  People will be able to ‚Äúhear‚Äù the thoughts of others and therefore people will think very carefully, knowing that all their intentions become common property.  Hide nothing out.  And this means that the purity of thoughts will increase.  And that means the number of evil deeds will decrease. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/144281/">https://habr.com/ru/post/144281/</a></p>
