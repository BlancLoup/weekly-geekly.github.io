  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Overview of the smartphone OPPO Find 5: "non-pop" flagship</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> I admit, until April of this year I did not hear about OPPO at all.  For the first time, having learned about the location of the company (and its plant) in China, taking into account the "obscurity" even made an incorrect conclusion about the image of the manufacturer.  And then, on April 24, a press conference was held in Moscow, at which I radically changed my opinion about this brand of phones.  As far as I can see, the habrakhabrovchane so far only ‚Äúdisassembled‚Äù the model OPPO Finder X907 (out of production, they will release an updated version).  In general, I decided to rectify the situation and talk about the OPPO Find 5 flagship that came into my hands. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4e7/fe5/f0c/4e7fe5f0cd2c917e61156e7b9e625f01.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  But first, still a little about OPPO.  Not for nothing on the Moscow "press" presentation OPPO Find 5 seemed to me such a second-order action.  The first was a story about the company itself and the features of its work in Russia.  In order not to bother anyone, I will focus on specific indicators: the staff of engineers is 1,400 people (40% are software), 6,000 people are on assembly lines, $ 300 million for branding last year, last year's turnover of the plant is $ 1.8 billion. And 6% of the Chinese market smartphones at the beginning of 2013.  Last year, OPPO Finder X907 retained the title of the thinnest (6.65 mm) smartphone in the world.  This is a word about the technical level of the company.  Now, a couple of my photos from the April event, where, due to the ‚Äúclub‚Äù atmosphere with gloomy lighting, at that time I was unable to properly evaluate the screen and OPPO Find 5 camera. Yes, and Wi-Fi in the stand area was rather a fiction.  However, I was a little distracted.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c60/9f0/33a/c609f033accbd7ea756e451850a18f62.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/951/42f/66f/95142f66fcb0927b5aaecd1d9710b7a9.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Box and equipment</b> <br><br>  I just feel awkward, but I have to praise the OPPO Find 5 box.  Nonstandard "vault" with opens like a gate.  And the very ‚Äúgates‚Äù in the closed state are held on the magnet.  Plus OPPO notably mocked the manufacturers, who, including in the flagship smartphones, do not want to use metal.  Here is a metal plate right on the box.  Not a fact, of course, that of stainless steel (as in the phone model itself). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fde/158/9e4/fde1589e495eb4b50328840435ed32d2.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/247/384/605/24738460546a9ea08ffbd2371361f607.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fbd/cdb/58d/fbdcdb58d25b7bdca07f5efb8e0f4c4e.jpg"><br><br>  The package bundle turned out to be rather poor: warranty book, headset, microUSB cable and charging unit.  Judging by the fact that the "guarantee" was entirely in Chinese, and the flat plug of the charger did not want to fit into the socket, I didn‚Äôt get a completely commercial version of the device.  Nevertheless, regarding the services and technical support, the localization of the smartphone was evident.  NFC-tags, which are in the photo, are not included in the Russian package. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/55f/b3b/07c/55fb3b07c7882d84251a5768a96ca6ec.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Appearance</b> <br><br>  The common features of the case remind us of the ‚Äúpast generation‚Äù of Sony Xperia, but the similarity is manifested by and large only in strict right angles and a slightly curved back cover.  With a teenage ‚Äúscreaming‚Äù design delights, the smartphone is not trying to hit, it looks solid and appropriate to its level. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3d6/88b/c4b/3d688bc4bea5af1e8bc629140af7868d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/922/e6e/769/922e6e769742ac53b9010d96ba2c699c.jpg"><br><br>  Two color options are available: black case or white (frontal part with frame around the display remains black). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c10/b4f/597/c10b4f597b6059cda40152a582438fdc.jpg"><br><br>  I liked the second option, since the white surface turned out to be much less branded.  By the way, the plastic case is matte, if someone is tired of sliding glossy surfaces from Korea.  In fairness, I will say that OPPO Find 5 also glides nicely in the palm of your hand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b98/362/7f0/b983627f0b9f034328c49077a5f68024.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/326/acd/063/326acd063153747c362e195705aa6955.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1ee/d8e/702/1eed8e702e1a1857e5c599cfae650234.jpg"><br><br>  About materials.  Plastic, which occupies a large part of the body, looks strong and not at all flimsy.  OPPO has played on the demand of users to use metal in their flagship solutions.  But not entirely predictable.  Instead of a metal back cover, we got stainless steel on the front of the phone.  Note for lovers of interesting facts: the plate is machined for 4 hours from a single bar weighing 210 grams - to the final 6.3 grams. <br><br>  Connector for the memory card is not that "sad" can be viewed from several positions.  It is possible that the system already ‚Äúeats‚Äù decently of memory.  In my 32 GB version, a total of 27.2 GB was available.  Although I would not say that the model is "overwhelmed" with software chips like the hodgepodge of Samsung flagships.  In addition, Full HD screen has to store a video library of the appropriate resolution.  To present a different perspective on the question, I quote an interview with the head of OPPO Mobile Russia, Yevgeny Zemskov, which was distributed in a printed video at a press conference: ‚ÄúOPPO conducted a study in China, Thailand and the United States to find out how much users need to have memory card slots in smartphones.  According to the results, it turned out that most consumers are completely satisfied with the amount of internal memory of their smartphone.  [...] An example of the same iPhone once again confirms this. "  I do not condone OPPO, nevertheless I am glad that such decisions are not made at random. <br><br>  There are only two keys on the case - the power button on the left side and the dual volume control on the right.  In the photo it may seem that the ‚Äúsunken‚Äù buttons are an illusion due to the use of transparent material.  Plus - the buttons are located "under the fingers", which is not always found in 5-inch smartphones.  Minus - the keys are too low profile.  It looks beautiful, but it's not very convenient to press.  Headset jack on top, microUSB at the bottom, no wonder. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/145/458/95b/14545895b62fa5df88f55e9264a09189.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e21/aa5/68e/e21aa568eeaeef0b4431e65fed54f0f2.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/766/93a/bc1/76693abc1fcaffce79a2c7ad2ec34a3a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/85b/3be/972/85b3be972b9c366da8dd8a8d3d5859a3.jpg"><br><br>  The design of the SIM card slot (more precisely, the micro-SIM) has confused me.  In order to leave the card holder out of the slot, you need to insert a thin long object (for example, a unfolded clip) into the hole next to it.  If suddenly on the road there is a need to change the "SIM cards", and the pins are not at hand - I do not envy you.  Before, I met a similar approach only in Prestigio Ultimate 10.1 3G tablet, where the clip was attached.  Judging by the OPPO Find 5 review on the ‚Äútrunk‚Äù, in the commercial version of the delivery, a similar element is also attached. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/db8/e13/e63/db8e13e6362476e49f955f179ae4e770.jpg"><br><br>  Regarding the general usability, I can‚Äôt say anything bad.  The weight of 165 grams and the thickness of 8.86 mm are normally combined against the background of the dimensions of the phone.  For fragile girls, the model will seem a bit heavy.  In his hand, the smartphone does not cause any discomfort.  In conclusion, a pair of "strokes" - on the front side there is a LED-indicator, and the rear is decorated with a metal frame insert for the camera and flash. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6f4/f7a/c4f/6f4f7ac4f74995a00f4cfcd6e61cbb2e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/50e/3e9/6a8/50e3e96a8f38116d39c54e5928431659.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Screen</b> <br><br>  There is nothing to complain about - Full HD display, 5 inches, 441 PPI, Gorilla Glass 2 protection. You can argue about IPS (in OPPO Find 5) vs Super AMOLED, but I wouldn‚Äôt do that on acquaintance with the model.  Largely due to the lack of an air layer between the matrix and the sensor layer.  Therefore, at first it seems as if you are working in 3D glasses, the picture looks so ‚Äúalive‚Äù.  Of course, this is most noticeable in HD and Full HD clips / movies.  And, sometimes, in games - oddly enough, here I was particularly struck by the recently released Can Knockdown 3. <br><br>  Of course, there is no way to get away from the IPS flaws, but they are minimally expressed - the ‚Äúblue‚Äù bloom, as well as the ‚Äúcolor‚Äù shades on the black portions (from the ‚Äúangled‚Äù position) can only be seen in the case of poor lighting.  In daylight, black looks quite deep.  By the way, the display retains good readability in the sun. <br><br>  <b>Camera</b> <br><br>  The rear 13 megapixels (the f / 2.2 aperture and CMOS format 1 / 3-06 inches were indicated on the slide of the presentation and the front 2 megapixels were shown in adult mode.  In the survey application, I was most struck by the lack of detailed settings.  That is, removed ISO, exposure, etc.  I didn‚Äôt even believe it at first and clarified this point in OPPO technical support.  In principle, the loss is small - I doubt that most users will notice a ‚Äúflaw‚Äù at all.  Plus, the interface was deprived of cluttering dubious utility options such as sharpness.  All that we have is a panel with four buttons: camera change;  flash control;  tab with HDR-option;  and a set of "grid", geotagging, smile recognition, camera sound, timer, resolution. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/23b/482/f3c/23b482f3c45cad54dce1404b9b0027d6.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/23b/482/f3c/23b482f3c45cad54dce1404b9b0027d6.png"><br><br>  The camera instantly takes pictures, as the angle changes, autofocus is constantly working.  To do a separate physical button shooting did not, instead, "shutter" can be any of the two volume keys.  The quality of photos is predictably high, I attach a couple of examples of pictures.  Macro shooting can be carried out from a distance of up to 5 cm, although it is not always possible to ‚Äúcatch‚Äù the focus from the first time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b08/eb3/727/b08eb3727a96a1ef58f62ee62a6fbf5e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cc0/5b2/03a/cc05b203ac014e2143e740d9e107ab80.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1a2/d02/29e/1a2d0229ef44ff14302133df766ecba2.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f3c/7df/5b2/f3c7df5b219107be5f8aeec3b626672f.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Performance</b> <br><br>  The assets of the smartphone Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Pro APQ8064 (1.5 GHz), Adreno 320 and 2 GB of RAM.  This is, if anything, the normal level of the top smartphone of the first and second quarter of 2013.  By the way, Sony Xperia Z is working on the same bundle of processor and graphics accelerator. Frankly, writing something particularly interesting about the speed / stability of the system itself doesn‚Äôt have to happen - there were no obvious ‚Äúcrashes‚Äù, no deadlocks ‚Äútightly‚Äù or systematic microlags were noticed.  Of course, nowhere without benchmarks - the results you can see clearly in the screenshots. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0e6/d4c/7c7/0e6d4c7c7ff8fac30476a993292762ce.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c65/571/cc7/c65571cc737302f695e885b7ab42cd0d.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b44/564/157/b445641576282e321043aa24d8c074dc.png"><br><br>  As for the games, again, I can‚Äôt make any special claims.  Once again, using the example of Dead Trigger, I saw how much the performance might vary.  In the case of a mid-level smartphone, it seemed to you that you are playing ‚Äúfast‚Äù - and then with OPPO Find 5 you start to remember that there is such a really powerful smartphone and a beautiful resource-demanding game with high FPS.  In Real Racing 3, everything was a ‚Äúbundle‚Äù; without falling through the FPS, driving took place at the sight of ‚Äúbehind‚Äù with a highly detailed drawing of my car.  At the beginning of the camera‚Äôs passage, there were still ‚Äúmicroscopic‚Äù moments of thoughtfulness.  Here is my ill-fated Ainol Novo 9, if I was waiting for the download level, apart from the competition. <br><br>  <b>System</b> <br><br>  Fortunately, in this section there is something to talk about.  I‚Äôll say right away that I liked OPPO Find 5 in this aspect because, unlike [I won‚Äôt point a finger], the model is not overloaded with the ‚Äúcrowd‚Äù of innovations, ‚Äúinnovative‚Äù solutions and various features.  I could even be concerned that much more could have been done with the OPPO software engineers.  But they will not.  In my personal opinion, the model has a balance between the finalization of the system and the platform overload.  In the latter case, one does not have to sigh about the impossibility of removing one or another useless ‚Äúproprietary‚Äù feature.  Just in case, I‚Äôll emphasize - this is my personal IMHO, which may differ from the opinion of the lovers of Android global customization out of the box. <br><br>  Android 4.1.1 is installed in OPPO Find 5, Android 4.2 is officially scheduled to be released.  In the settings, the installation of periodic checks for updates is available.  It is worth believing that, with the help of this tool, OPPO provides ‚Äúintermediate‚Äù updates, if necessary. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d08/0f4/d94/d080f4d9400a381a18a01f690e914e65.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b3a/8e5/106/b3a8e5106271755347674e1be98ecc1d.png"><br><br>  Getting acquainted with the lock screen.  To access the desktop, we make a tangential gesture, as if unwinding a ‚Äúglass window‚Äù along the vertical axis. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/492/2b4/3df/4922b43df67735ca5ad86aded4a0acec.png"><br><br>  A total of six desktops are offered.  The bottom panel is customizable and can contain five shortcuts.  Creating a folder by transferring one icon to another also affects the open list of applications.  Actually, only two screens of the program list are explained by the use of folders - social networks, Yandex and Google services, as well as Utilities were grouped.  Hi Sony Xperia Z. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f57/fc8/120/f57fc8120a913b1ddaba803c70c9edfe.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/693/fe0/377/693fe0377749d52de417703d47a712c3.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/693/fe0/377/693fe0377749d52de417703d47a712c3.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3ff/04e/42c/3ff04e42c11494ffb6fe1fd34b949e15.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b36/5bc/6d4/b365bc6d4570302a69b8354e11b45dfa.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a74/8c3/9db/a748c39dba984193cf4832714896cfec.png"><br><br>  As you can see, with additional programs not overdo it.  Of the standard applications, many have undergone a redesign - a calendar, a clock, a gallery, etc.  I remember a few moments most of all.  The first is a feedback form.  I started the program, wrote about the problem - sent it - got an answer.  Simple and effective.  In general, it would be possible to write a separate article about OPPO technical support.  The utilities contain a ‚Äúbrief‚Äù instruction, which is actually quite voluminous.  The information collection is well-designed and will not be superfluous for reading at leisure to any owner of this model. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8b7/50a/26d/8b750a26d4829692ed1a1a549eb37d44.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f4f/cfa/630/f4fcfa630fddab5a461b5487e61a863d.png"><br><br>  A good impression was left by the file manager, with built-in FTP and DLNA functions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/45d/def/7ae/45ddef7aed970fcb6758052dd02434be.png"><br><br>  But strangely enough, the settings made an impression on me.  Here, the developers "came off", giving out almost 50 total points in four tabs.  Almost everything is subject to adjustment, including the operation of the LED indicator.  Perhaps, I was pleased not so much with the abundance of settings, as their visibility and ease of "orientation" <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0bc/6ed/163/0bc6ed16316e505398c09dae2ffa2b63.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0bc/6ed/163/0bc6ed16316e505398c09dae2ffa2b63.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0bc/6ed/163/0bc6ed16316e505398c09dae2ffa2b63.png"><br><br>  <b>Sound</b> <br><br>  Finally, we got to one of the most remarkable features of the model - Dirac HD Audio.  OPPO describes this as a technology with software and hardware sound processing, commonly used in hi-end audio and video systems: ‚Äú[...] immerse yourself in the sound that the artist originally laid into the song.‚Äù  The above quote seemed somewhat strange to me, since it‚Äôs rather a matter of sound that the sound producer is laying.  That is, in fact, we are pointed to the monitor sound, which music lovers do not favor too much for ‚Äúdryness‚Äù.  If anything, Dirac is responsible for the audio systems in Bentley and Rolls-Roys.  And in OPPO Find 5 :) <br><br>  Anyway, for me, the baseless listening was made by rootless ‚Äúplugs‚Äù for 20 euros from Amsterdam, as well as AKG K44 and AKG K272HD headphones.  I can not say that I was extremely impressed with what I heard, but the quality is really excellent.  Here it should be understood that the smartphone still implies listening to high-quality recording with high bitrate.  Otherwise, get ready to listen to the flaws of the pinched files.  Of course, the AKG K272HD did not succeed in ‚Äúshaking up‚Äù the smartphone, in other headphones the sound for ‚Äúnormal‚Äù audibility was set out with the remaining volume margin of about 30% of the maximum. <br><br>  Special attention deserves the headset.  I note that for some time now I haven‚Äôt been unpacking the bags with a headset at all - probably due to the dominance in testing models of the average price range.  So, after listening to the complete ‚Äúears‚Äù, I willingly believe that they were developed by OPPO with the direct participation of Dirac.  The sound is excellent, but one thing confuses - where are the foam pads ?!  It turns out that a person buys a smartphone for almost 20 thousand rubles - and is forced to look for ‚Äútips‚Äù?  However, the impression of the headset I remember more than the omission indicated OPPO. <br><br>  The multimedia speaker did not disappoint - it ‚Äúseems‚Äù loud, it does not choke.  In fact - almost a mobile column is obtained.  Of course, there is no bass as a class, but with the remaining frequencies there are no obvious simplifications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/865/0b9/bf4/8650b9bf4e5b74538b3db9a4d9a27405.jpg"><br><br>  The music player deserves no less attention than the sound system.  Playback menu is decorated attractively ascetic, we will not particularly dwell on it - we are interested in settings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7a4/6e6/a4e/7a46e6a4e1d1e675acd8d1f560a3a09e.png"><br><br>  Inquisitive music lovers will have to stay in the settings, building "their" sound - there are many options.  In the ‚ÄúHeadphone Mode‚Äù tab, I selected Dolby Mobile.  In practice, with the Dirac effect, the sound somehow became somewhat clamped, with a clear emphasis on high frequencies.  The problem could be solved by an equalizer, but for some strange reason, when you turn on the Dirac effect, other settings are disabled. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/136/8f3/14d/1368f314d100b1b4bf8ba051affb9817.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/17a/014/598/17a01459835ff31294c99c4097940e34.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1af/bf9/167/1afbf9167b88b7878dcc01f837554439.png"><br><br>  ‚ÄúSurround Sound‚Äù is a useful item.  with him the sound becomes a little livelier.  Four settings (off, normal, medium or strong) are provided separately for high and low frequencies.  Crowns a set of equalizer - with presets for styles (where is the repchik something? :)) plus a 7-band field for experiments of experienced users. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br><br>  In some points, I still did not highlight points like supported wireless standards or battery life.  In the first case, I can‚Äôt say anything special, but in the second, we are talking about one standard smartphone-day.  Although resource-intensive features should not be abused.  OPPO Find 5 is gluttonous, with the use of "to the fullest" user risks to look for a socket before the evening. <br><br>  In the minuses of the smartphone, I would write down the battery and the strange connector for the SIM card, in the remaining moments I don‚Äôt see any significant flaws (just correct it).  Otherwise, OPPO Find 5 doesn‚Äôt look like the ‚Äúblack sheep‚Äù for its tactical and technical characteristics, if you try to align it with the top Full HD smartphones from Sony, HTC or, I'm not afraid, Samsung.  The official price tag for the version with 16 GB of memory is 19,990 rubles, for 32 GB, 22,990 rubles is already being asked.  If we drop the "official", on average, the price tag of competitors starts with 25 thousand rubles.  In my opinion, OPPO Find 5 is worth its money.  Moreover, the model will be interesting to those who wish to stand out among the owners of the flagship pop producers. <br><br>  Finally, I note that OPPO promises to present in Russia until the end of the year every month on one new model.  As far as I can tell from the brand site, the OPPO Clover R815 model is on the way.  This dvuhsimochnik with a diagonal of 4.3 inches is interesting 4-core processor (although who will surprise with this?) And, more importantly, the presence of Dirac HD Audio.  Judging by the interview, the lowest possible price tag of OPPO models in Russia will fluctuate around 10 thousand rubles.  I will not draw premature conclusions - we will see if the novelty falls into my hands. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/184492/">https://habr.com/ru/post/184492/</a></p>
