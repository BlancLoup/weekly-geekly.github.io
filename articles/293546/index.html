  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Rush about Kabanchik: how it all began. Part 1</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We begin our blog with a story about who and why the Kabanchik.com.ua project was created - an online service ordering service that brings together on the one hand customers of services (from courier delivery to babysitter or overhaul) and performers (professionals looking for a part-time job or additional income). ). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/109/8c0/f7a/1098c0f7aebe776c8554c751e2dc3934.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Now the team Metni Kabanchik has 13 people already, but it took only two young entrepreneurs to start the project: Roman Kirigetov and Alexander Yuriev.  Roman had experience in managing and building an offline business from scratch.  Promotion of Internet projects was just his hobby, which he worked in his free time.  Even as a student, Alexander became interested in developing websites, independently learned several programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãand managed to work in outsourcing to the western market for a couple of years. <br><br>  As an idea for the project, the creators of Kabanchik used the experience of the American project TaskRabbit, which at that time was successfully developing in many US cities.  But simply copying the Taskbrabit model would be very inefficient, since  Western user market is very different from the market of post-Soviet countries.  It was necessary to adapt the model to our realities.

      The name of the project itself came to mind the founders.  Well, what phrase can better describe the essence of the service, rather than ‚Äúshoot the pig‚Äù?  This name could not please everyone, but certainly did not leave anyone indifferent.  And this is the main rule of good branding.  Plus, the domain kabanchik.com.ua was free - it was a sign. <br><br>  Immediately after the purchase of a domain friends set to work.  For a start, a prototype of the future project and the main logic were sketched.  Then they began to design and content filling.  All the work on the project was done independently in my free time and on weekends (both founders at that time had a permanent job), without attracting additional specialists.  This saved an impressive part of the funds that the founders planned to spend on marketing the product. <br><br>  After two months of work, the guys already had a working alpha version of the project.  A couple of weeks of testing, as well as satisfaction of a sense of makeovers and the project was ready for the presentation of the general public.  The launch was scheduled for September 17th, 2012. <br><br>  We will talk about how the first day of the project launch and the first marketing experiments took place in our next post in a week. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293546/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293546/</a></p>
