People may also be able to seize such advantages in the near future. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  When cells wear out, they don't always die.  Instead, they begin to secrete compounds that can harm the surrounding tissue.  This process is known as cellular aging. <br>  Our immune system itself gets rid of worn out cells, but it gets worse and worse with aging.

      It has already been observed that an increased number of these cells is associated with cardiac arrest, arthritis, Alzheimer's disease and cancer. <br>  By getting rid of these cells, we rid ourselves of these problems - show studies in mice, conducted by Darren Baker and his team. <br><br>  The team of scientists used a line of INC-ATTAC transgenic mice, the aged cells of which expressed not only their characteristic p16Ink4a protein, but also two additional ones associated with it.  This made these cells sensitive to the action of the synthetic agent AP20187, so that they were destroyed when the drug was introduced into the body. <br><br>  The drug they have developed has shown that in one application it is possible to get rid of 70% of these cells. <br>  The team used this drug to remove worn cells from a 12-month-old mouse (equivalent to 40 human years) 2 times a week for the rest of their lives. <br>  This age is not chosen by chance.  It is known that around this period, clumps of worn cells begin to bring problems. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThis may be a prevention strategy, because we do not allow these cells to accumulate,‚Äù says Baker <br><br><h3>  <font color="#1565c0">Live longer and be healthier</font> </h3><br>  Mice subjected to this drug, lived on average 25% - 35% longer than their counterparts in the control group. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThis is similar to extending human life from 80 to 100 years (25%),‚Äù says Baker <br><br>  In addition, the test subjects managed to avoid diseases associated with aging. <br>  After 6 months of therapy <br>  - their hearts were healthier <br>  - recovery from stress was faster <br>  - and the kidneys have less scarring (which usually appear with aging) <br><br>  In addition, they did not develop cataracts and cancer, until the very last "years" of life.  What can not be said about their comrades from the control group. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIf in 2011, you asked me whether it would be possible to achieve this, I would say that we are still very far from this,‚Äù Baker said, ‚ÄúBut we worked on it for a long time, and it turned out to be easier than we thought " <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe next main goal is to modify the drug and achieve complete removal of these cells in just one procedure in the human body.‚Äù <br><br>  Perhaps in the near future, Baker and his team, working with Unity Biotechnology (specifically aimed at fighting aging), will be able to repeat this success in humans.  In any case, there is reason to believe that this will be so, since the research is moving towards clinical trials, which is good news. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">A video in English in which the professor talks about this study.</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/w8UHzkXC4HQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjNxjOCNBbm39Vg-ui3ZOStSoevng" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Link to the article on the website of the clinic</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <a href="http://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-researchers-extend-lifespan-by-as-much-as-35-percent-in-mice-2/">Opens in the same tab</a> <br></div></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/367841/">https://habr.com/ru/post/367841/</a></p>
