  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Write your insurance agent: Ingosstrakh organizes hackathon</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Until December 4, the selection of teams for <a href="http://tech.ingos.ru/">INGOS TECH 7.0</a> continues - the largest hackathon, organized by one of the main insurers in Russia.  This is not the first such event of the company.  Prior to this, Ingosstrakh's IT department stretched its muscles on a more compact event - its announcement was published only on the website ingos.ru. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zn/ig/ji/znigji2tspnxsmygmax_sygtgbo.jpeg"><br><br>  However, several professional teams immediately came to him: there were startups in full force, and employees of established companies, who were ‚Äúassigned‚Äù to participate in the hackathon.  As it turned out, a lot of people were interested not only to show themselves, but also to offer the insurance giant some of their ideas, products or developments. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  However, the first run in the end was not very successful: as the IT-director of Ingosstrakh, Aleksey Klepikov, explained to me, it was not possible to work together with them because of differences in the market vision.  Many projects, even completely oriented in their idea to the insurance segment, did not include a single person with a professional insurance background.

      Therefore, one of the tasks of INGOS TECH 7.0 is the dialogue between professional insurers and professional IT professionals, which will create the opportunity to share with them an understanding of the tasks that are facing today in business. <br><br>  To do this, on the <a href="http://tech.ingos.ru/">hackathon,</a> teams will have to choose one of the areas of work: <br><br><ul><li>  Interfaces </li><li>  Chat bots; </li><li>  Business cases for the insurance company; </li><li>  Future insurance; </li><li>  Institutional rating models. </li></ul><br>  In some of them, the conditions of development are given, in others there is complete freedom of action.  An example is the creation of a chat bot for insurance, which will answer various customer questions.  So the hackathon will help the company understand which tools are best suited for creating, for example, chat bots.  This is done to free people from simple descriptions of insurance products, services and goods. <br><br>  This is not the first such initiative of Ingosstrakh.  In addition to the formation of the market, they are engaged in education in principle.  The <a href="http://dbmsu.ru/">Doing Business</a> tutorial program at Moscow State University, which is 100% sponsored by Ingosstrakh, has been operating for several years already.  This year, exactly 70 students were admitted to the school in honor of the 70th anniversary of the company. <br><br>  Ingosstrakh is looking for fresh ideas for going beyond the insurance business, subsequent partnership and cooperation with other projects.  The team is interested in how the insurance of the future can transform in order to be one of the first in this future.  Now, for example, some insurance companies are testing online on and off insurance.  Ingosstrakh goes further and is interested, for example, how the blockchain is suitable for exchanging data on insurance claims and loss of customers.  As it turned out, some insurers are not interested in providing the market with correct data about this, preferring to substitute competitors with ‚Äúbad‚Äù customers.  Could the blockchain solve this problem?  Or you can use smart contracts for insurance payments to customers directly?  Ingosstrakh is looking for answers to these and other questions with the help of the IT community. <br><br><h2>  Record on hakaton </h2><br>  In order to take part in the competition, you need to solve a <a href="http://demo.ccdr.tech/ingostech/%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5%2520%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5%2520%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BB%25D1%258F%2520INGOS%2520TECH%25207.0.pdf">test task</a> until December 4, submit your application and indicate in detail the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãyour project in the chosen nomination. <br><br>  Hackathon will be held in Moscow. <br><br>  Beginning: December 9, Saturday, 10:00. <br>  End of the event and award winners: December 10, Sunday, 20:00. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/343676/">https://habr.com/ru/post/343676/</a></p>
