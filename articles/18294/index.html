  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why I do not like the iPhone</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Being in Silicon Valley, I went to the <a href="http://www.apple.com/retail/paloalto/map/">Apple</a> store at University Ave - this is the store where Steve Jobs becomes a proxy when the company launches a new product.  I held the iPhone in my hands and got sick.  I was sick for 2 weeks, then I went to Cupertino to the company's headquarters and in the main store I bought two pipes - myself and my wife. <br>  I came to Kiev, they unblocked them very easily and quickly (I managed to get version 1.1.1) and I just sang songs for a week.  Why?  Here's why: <br>  - after absolutely wooden communicators on WM, the interface just pleased.  There can be no objection here.  Apple, as always, was not up to par, but just floated in the sky with a giant margin from competitors. <br>  - music.  everything is very compact.  The device ate 4G of my favorite songs and everything fell into place. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  - very pleased with the integrated YouTube <br>  - The virtual keyboard was not very comfortable, but nevertheless very competent.  in a week there were no problems <br>  - Safari.  I was not ready for this.  More convenient tool I have not seen on handhelds.  This is a full web. <br>  - multitouch screen.  I want to highlight this in a separate paragraph.  Stuck is really revolutionary. <br>  - traveling on a map from Google is really not just a necessary thing, but an irreplaceable one. <br>  - I had enough batteries for a working day (!!!), I haven‚Äôt had one yet. <br><br>  And a week later I began to feel sad.  I use the phone for work and I immediately had problems using the tools I was used to: <br>  - it turned out to be very painful without the ability to synchronize tasks with Outlook - not everything can be scored on the calendar in a convenient way <br>  - inability to synchronize mail in your inbox with a computer.  You can work only with the server. <br>  - the same applies to the notes that are used to. <br>  - the impossibility of comparing a certain number with the name from the address book (the operator gives the number without +, and in the phone all the numbers are in the international format). <br>  - Lack of search in the notebook.  When the phone 2000 contacts browse very difficult. <br>  - The base hundred for working with sms first killed a cool interactive interface, but then it came to an understanding of the inconvenience when you cannot delete a separate sms. <br>  - ICQ, Skype.  It was tough.  If the ICQ client was any (probably no), then with Skype it was sad. <br>  - no voice recorder. <br>  - it suddenly turned out that you cannot stick my favorite headphones into it. <br><br>  Some problems were solved with the help of third-party applications, but the key ones remained unsolved.

      My first thought was to return my <a href="http://market.mabila.ua/catalog/communicator/e-ten/m700/">Golden Fish</a> , but I could not.  WM turned out to be simply non-usable, the stylus seemed just a rudiment.  I could not. <br><br>  With all due respect to Jobs personally, to Apple and all the products it produces, the iPhone, as a business tool, turned out to be a very weak product. <br><br>  Two more problems that turned out to be - this is quality.  Of the two phones, two were defective.  I had a problem with one of the speakers (it just didn‚Äôt work), and my wife‚Äôs phone didn‚Äôt work well with a sensor that detects the phone near the ear and regularly switches to speakerphone when the cheek is touched. <br><br>  In fairness, I will say that just for the spouse the phone turned out to be very convenient, useful and she uses it with great pleasure. <br><br>  I will wait for the device with Android (maybe everything will be right there), although I do not have confidence that someone will be able to beat the iPhone in usability.  Rather, I have the confidence that they can not. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/18294/">https://habr.com/ru/post/18294/</a></p>
