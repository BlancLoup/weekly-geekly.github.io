      I found the best and most accurate illustration of this sensation in the novel ‚ÄúEndless Joke‚Äù by David Foster Wallace, for which our translators were afraid to take on more than 20 years.  This week the translation finally came out.  We publish the most ridiculous and creepy-prophetic passage about invisible madness due to our dependence on technology. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The passage parodies the IT article in Zhur and tells how the future of America (where even the chronology is credited) started a videophony.  People received a new technology, without which they had lived well before, and had complexes from their image on the screen.  Then the business came up with ideal masks for them, which, of course, did not get rid of the complexes, but turned them into a whole social and mental disorder. <br><br>  It's funny to know that all this is written before the advent of Skype, smart cameras with AI and filters for machine learning photos (even if Wallace, like most writers, did not foresee the rejection of analog media). <br><br>  I asked one of the translators of the book, Alexey Polyarinov, what he thinks about this problem.  Like Wallace, Alexey clearly noticed where the main evil lurks. <br><blockquote>  In the ninth edition of Warren Ellis's Transmetropolitan comic, the main character travels on reservations.  One of them is called ‚ÄúFarsight community‚Äù, it differs from the others in that nobody controls the technology in it.  They are fundamentally against control.  ‚ÄúFarsight‚Äù is a test techno-testing ground, any strange novelty is immediately put into action, everyone can turn themselves into cyborg, edit their DNA and increase their intelligence.  It sounds good, but in fact, utopia looks pretty creepy - the death rate is much higher than in the outside world, and people have long lost their human appearance. <br><br>  I like this release of Transmet.  He very clearly shows that the main problem of any technology is man.  We humans are pretty bad with a sense of proportion.  And when creating new technologies, problems arise precisely in these areas - we are strange and unpredictable. <br><br>  In the fragment of ‚ÄúInfinite jokes‚Äù about videophony, Wallace says something like this: a good idea seems to be bent and reached the point of absurdity when the human factor came into force. </blockquote><br><hr><br><h2>  An excerpt from the "Infinite Joke" about the death of videophony </h2><br>  <b>Why - despite the fact that in the early years of the teleputers connected to the single InterLace network, which worked on the same fiber-digital system as the telephone companies, the innovation of video calls (or ‚Äúvideophony‚Äù) was highly popular - users were delighted from the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcommunicating with both audio and video (the first generation of small videophone cameras were too primitive and narrow-aperture to suit anything other than close-ups of the face) on first-generation teleputers, which at the time</b>  <b>I was practically ordinary TVs, although, of course, with this mandatory icon of the tiny little man ‚ÄúArtificial Intelligence‚Äù, who appeared in the lower right corner during the air / cable broadcast and reported the time and temperature outside, or reminded that it was time to take pills for pressure , or warned that on some channel there, such as the 491st, extremely interesting entertainment will soon begin, or, of course, reported on the incoming video call, and then tap dancing with symbolic boaters and a reed under the option menu</b>  <b>s, how users liked these icons of people, but yes, why within 16 months, or five financial districts, the demand for videophony suddenly surged, like a house of cards, so much so that by the Year of Absorbent Lingerie for Adults ‚ÄúDepend‚Äù any video fiber data transmitters or related products and services were used with less than 10% of all private telephone communications, and the average American user of the phone still preferred the retrograde old low-tech voice telephone</b>  <b>the conspiracy, as in the Bell era, was a change in preferences, which cost a considerable number of videotelephone businessmen of the latest shirt, plus destabilized two extremely respected mutual funds relying on videophone technology, and also almost wiped out the Maryland pension fund from the face of the earth - the fund, the brother of the manager's mistress of which was an entrepreneur, was almost manically obsessed with videophone technology ... And, in general, why did consumers so sharply move to the good old voice telephony?</b> <br><br>  The answer, in three words, is: <br><br><ol><li>  emotional stress </li><li>  experiences because of the appearance, </li><li>  some strange self-destructive logic of microeconomics of household high-tech. </li></ol><br>  <b>1)</b> It turned out that visual telephone conversations for some reason caused terrible stress, which was not observed in voice conversations.  Users of the videophony suddenly seemed to realize that with conventional voice telephony, they lived in a deceptive, but generally wonderful, illusion.  Previously, they never even noticed it, the illusion ‚Äî it was sort of so emotionally complex that it became possible to discern it only in the context of loss. <br><br>  The good old traditional audio phones left room for assumptions that the person on the other end of the wire listens to you with undivided attention, while allowing not to pay any attention at all to it.  Traditional acoustic communication - through the telephone receiver, in the earpiece of which there were only 6 small holes, but in the microphone (not without reason, as it turned out later) - 62, or 36 small holes - allows you to enter into some kind of motorway-hypnotic fugue of half-awareness: during a conversation you can look around the room, draw, smarten up, pick a burr, write haiku in the phone book, stir in pans on the stove;  it is even possible to communicate separately with those present in the room in sign language and grimaces, while ostensibly listening carefully to the voice on the handset.  And yet - and this, retrospectively, is the most wonderful nuance - although you yourself paid attention to the telephone call and all kinds of idle fug trifles, you were never depressed by the suspicion that the interlocutor on the other end of the wire just did not pay all the attention only to you.  For example, during a traditional call, while, say, you perform a close tactile examination of the skin of the chin for defects, you are never taken to the idea that the interviewee may also pay a considerable percentage of attention to the tactile examination of the skin on the chin for defects.  It was an illusion, and an acoustic illusion, and it was acoustically supported: the voice from the other end of the wire was compact, squeezed and directed right into your ear, and left a place for delusion that the attention of the voice owner is similarly compressed and focused ... although attention - no, that's what's the matter. <br><br>  From an emotional point of view, this two-sided illusion of one-sided attention caused almost childish joy: the person believed that he had taken control of someone's undivided attention without having to respond to it in return.  If you look at the past objectively, the illusion seems aratial, almost literally fantastic: it‚Äôs like lying and trusting others at the same time. <br><br>  Video telephony ruined a similar fantasy.  Now the callers have found that they have to portray the same sincere, slightly imaginary expression of attention to the listener, as in personal communication.  Those subscribers who succumbed to the fuzzy habit of drawing or smoothing wrinkles on their pants, now looked impolite, scattered or childishly fixated on themselves.  Subscribers who, in even greater unconsciousness, examined the skin on their chin for defects or examined the nasal cavities, saw horror on the video faces on the other end of the wire.  All this led to videophone stress. <br><br>  Even worse, of course, there was an injury akin to exile from paradise, when you delineate your thumb on the page in the diary or put your hand in your pants, correcting the position of your good old Block, and then you look up and see how your videophony interlocutor with interest picks out the lace from the eglet , and suddenly you realize that the whole infantile fantasy, as if you own the attention of a partner, while you yourself are drawing and correcting the positions of the genitals in a state of a fugue, was an unfounded illusion, and that you own someone else‚Äôs attention no more than  It is its handle.  In general, all these problems with attention - continuous stress, users decided. <br><br>  <b>2)</b> And the videophone stress was even stronger if it was about any kind of vain people.  Those.  about those who care about how they look.  In the eyes of others.  But seriously, who does not care?  Good old acoustic telephone calls could be made without any makeup, wig, surgical prostheses, etc. Yes, even without any clothes, if you already have such cockroaches.  But those who care about appearance, of course, could have forgotten about the informal ‚Äúanswer-in-what-is‚Äù in the case of visual video calls, which began to seem to subscribers like not the good old phone call, but the doorbell when before you open it, you have to throw something on yourself, fasten dentures and smooth the hair in front of a mirror in the hallway. <br><br>  But the last nail in the coffin of the videophony was the look of the faces of the callers on the TP-screen during the calls.  Not the persons calling them, but their own, it was worth seeing them on video.  In the end, turn on the TP video recording function, record both signals in a two-way video call, play the call again and see how your face actually looked in the eyes of the interlocutor - it‚Äôs a matter of three buttons.  And to keep from such a check is as difficult as to look into a random mirror.  But the result was almost universally terrifying.  People were horrified at how their faces look on the TP-screen.  And it's not just the ‚Äúobesity announcer‚Äù - the well-known effect of excess weight on the person in the video.  No, worse.  Even in the advanced screens of high-definition TP, subscribers saw their phone faces as blurry and wet, they saw some brilliantly pale uncertainty, which seemed to them not just unsightly, but thieving, insidious, unreliable, unpleasant.  In an early and ominous InterLace / GTE focus group survey, the results of which in a fit of entrepreneurial NF-technical agiotage all closed their eyes, almost 60% of respondents who received visual access to their own faces during videophone calls, especially often to describe their appearances used the words "unreliable", "unpleasant" or "amateur", and the phenomenally sinister 71% of senior citizens specifically compared their video faces to Richard Nixon's face during the Nixon and Kennedy debates in 1960 BC.  with. <br><br>  A solution to the problem that the psychological consultants of the telecommunications industry have called videophysiognomic dysphoria (or VFD) has become, of course, the flourishing of High-Resolution Masks;  and, interestingly, it was precisely those businessmen who were engaged in videophone image processing in HD, and then frankly switched to the production of masks, came out of the short-term videophonic era with shirts, and in addition, with substantial additional profits. <br><br>  If we talk about masks, the initial option of Photographic Image Processing in HD - i.e.  take the most flattering elements from a variety of flattering photos of this telephone subscriber from different angles and - thanks to the imaging programs of those times already tested by pioneers from the cosmetic and law enforcement areas - to combine them into an extremely attractive, obscure, face-to-face collage with a sincere, slightly with a simulated expression of undivided attention, - the option, which is less expensive and saving bytes, quickly replaced (based on the same cosmetic and fbrovskiy software)  tlivat improved image of the face on the fitting polybutylene mask, and soon consumers found that the high cost of a permanent mask to wear thanks to the miraculous effect on stress and WFM paid off more than, well, convenient Velcro to attach the mask on the back of his head, and does cost a penny;  and a couple of fiscal quarters, telephone / cable companies strengthened customer self-confidence undermined VFD by agreeing to a deal in a horizontal integration format, thanks to which free collage services and masks came in one package with a videophony.  HD masks usually hung on a small hook on the side of the TP phone console, admittedly, with some kind of surreal and unnerving look: separated from the body, empty and wrinkled - and in places of collective access, that is, in large families or companies, and potentially embarrassing embarrassments due to the confusion of personalities in the hasty selection of the wrong hanging mask from a long row ‚Äî in general, the masks at first seemed to be a viable industry response to the problem of appearance, stress, and the Nixon effect. <br><br>  <b>(2 and, probably, 3 more)</b> But now add up the natural entrepreneurial instinct to fully satisfy the exaggerated demands of the client on the one hand with almost the same natural distortion with which people usually see themselves, and then the rate of full exit from the control of the HD video boom will be explained masks.  It is not only that it is unusually difficult to independently assess how you look, good or not so hot - for example, look in the mirror and try to determine where you are in the hierarchy of attractiveness, at least approximately with the same objective ease with which you distribute all the others, they look good or not so hot - but in addition it turned out that instinctively distorted consumer self-perception plus the stress connected with the appearance led to the fact that consumers began to prefer, and then openly demand  Deof masks, which really looked much better than themselves.  Manufacturers of HD-masks, gladly ready to provide not only credibility, but also aesthetic improvements - willed chins, smaller bags under the eyes, smeared scars and wrinkles - were soon beaten out of the niche of the market by manufacturers of original mimetic masks.  In an increasingly frank progression in just a couple of financial districts, most consumers now used masks with a videophone, so aesthetically superior to their real faces in physical conversation, broadcast to each other so horribly distorted and improved images of themselves that the giant psycho-social stress and a huge number of subscribers suddenly began to show in general, they stopped to leave home and communicate personally with people, because those, as they were afraid, were already accustomed to seeing by phone their much more beautiful beliefs  these and in person will experience (as their phobia dictated) the same aesthetic disappointment and collapse of illusions, such as, for example, women who always wear makeup, people who suddenly see them without makeup can cause. <br><br>  The social fears accompanying the phenomenon, named by psycho-consultants with optimistic non-representative disguise (or ONM), truly progressed against the background of how tiny rough first-generation videophone cameras improved and got an aperture wider, and now tiny advanced cameras could reflect and broadcast images more or less in full height.  Some psychologically unscrupulous entrepreneurs brought to the market growth polybutylene and polyurethane 2D tantamaresks - something like headless "strong man" or "beauty in the soul" for cheap photos on the beach, behind which you stand up and put your chin on a cardboard stand, only these growth videophone masks were much more advanced and reliable.  But it was worth adding various 2D wardrobes, options for eyes and hair, various aesthetic supplements, cuts, etc., as prices hit the ceiling of market opportunities, although it was then that social pressure forced you to buy the best possible 2D growth images so as not to feel relatively ugly on the phone.  At this point, anyone will tell how little time passes before a restless entrepreneurial drive to an ideal mousetrap is embodied in the form of a Broadcast Screensaver (or TK), which, in retrospect, seems to be a really sharp end of the nail in the coffin of videophony.  With TK in facial and growth masks, it was no longer necessary - they were replaced by a video-translated image, in fact, a retouched photo, with an incredibly fit, attractive, tastefully dressed person, resembling the caller only in such limited relationships as, for example, race or number of limbs , and the face in the photo was focused on the videophone camera from the depth of the magnificent - but not deliberately - furnished room, which best reflected the image that you wanted to broadcast, etc. <br><br>  The screensavers were simply ready-to-broadcast photos with high resolution of about diaram proportions, located on a plastic bracket above the pupil of a videophone camera, approximately like a lens cap.  Extremely beautiful, but not terribly successful celebrities from the online media - those who in past years would add to the social advertising casters - whether we are in the field of modeling for various advanced Videophone Screensavers. <br><br>  Since the Screensavers were a regular and always ready-to-broadcast photograph instead of computer processing and enhancements, they could be massively produced and priced commensurately, and, although not for long, the Screensavers helped to reduce the tension between the high cost of the improved growth mask and the monstrous aesthetic pressure of video on subscribers, not to mention the creation of many jobs for interior designers, photographers, retouchers and celebrities at the level of social networks, frightened by the decline of on-air television advertising. <br><br>  <b>3)</b> But from the graph of more than the short-term viability of innovation in domestic technologies, some lesson can be learned.  The path of videophony fits perfectly into the classic ring shape of this graphic: first, in everyday technologies, a magnificent, sci-fi innovation emerges - such as the transfer of calls from audio to video - which always, unfortunately, leads to unforeseen drawbacks for the consumer;  and but then the niches of the market created by these shortcomings - like the stressful rejection of people experiencing because of their appearance, because of their own videophone image - are ingeniously filled by businessmen with a lively imagination;  and yet it is precisely the advantages of these ingenious compensations of disadvantages that seem too often to undermine the original high-tech innovation, which leads to an outflow of consumers, closure of the schedule and mass loss of shirts of rash investors.  In this case, the evolution of compensation of stress and problems with appearance caused first the failure of video callers from their own faces, then from disguised and improved to the limit of physical similarities, and as a result, the closure of cameras and the transfer from one TP to another attractively stylized static Screen Savers.  And behind these diorama lens caps and screensavers broadcast, subscribers, of course, found that they were again invisible, stresslessly seamless, without wigs and with bags under their eyes, behind their dioramas with celebrities like a stone wall, and free again - because. invisible again - draw, look around for skin defects, do a manicure, smooth your pants - while the attractive celebrity‚Äôs attractive, attentively attentive face from the Screensaver on the other end of the wire was convinced from the screen that they were objects of concentration  Rowan attention, which, in turn, they are not required themselves. <br><br>  And, of course, all these advantages are nothing but the once lost and re-acquired advantages of the good old blind acoustic telephony of the Bell era, with its 6 and 62 holes.  The only difference was that a foolish unreal stylized Screen Saver flying in a pretty penny was transmitted via expensive fiber-optic lines between TPs.  After this awareness leaked into the minds of consumers and spread everywhere (most interestingly, mostly through the phone), then any microenometerist would have said how little time would pass to the inevitable oblivion of an advanced visual videophony, after which the return to good old telephony was not followed. only on the orders of common consumer sense, but even cultural approval in the form of some fashionable principles: not Luddism, but a kind of retrograde victory over SF-hi-tech for the sake of purity of soul, victory over labor  in front of the appearance and in the face of high-tech fashion ‚Äî slavery, which people find in each other so unattractive.  In other words, the return to acoustic telephony became at the end of the closed curve of the graph a certain status symbol of anti-vanity, so only subscribers with a lack of self-awareness continued to use videophony and Screen Savers, not to mention masks, and these tasteless facsimile lovers became ironic symbols of tasteless vain slavery before PR corporations and cutting-edge innovations - for the era of sponsorship, the tasteless equivalents of people in bright costumes, with pictures on black velvet, sweaters for poods  her electric zirconia bracelet, LingvaSkrebkami "NouKout" and so on.  Most of the subscribers of communications threw Screensavers-dioramas on the mezzanine and closed the cameras with standard black caps for the lens, and on the hangers for masks on telephone consoles they hung new trendy address and telephone notebooks with special rings on the bindings for convenient hanging on former hangers for masks.   , ,        ,   ,‚Äî ,        per se,                 ,      . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/433704/">https://habr.com/ru/post/433704/</a></p>
