      If you take a camera that writes on film cassettes (the cheapest version by the way), then you need to get a piece that will digitize everything you have captured.  Among the products of Pinnacle there are a lot of options, from low-cost PC boards embedded into PCs, to external simpatish pieces connected to the camera and PC / Mac. <br><br>  <i>Film cassettes are like that, because you have to buy a certain type of cassette and finally go with them, like girls with tampaks.</i> <br><br>  There is another option, when the camera writes directly to a CD / miniCD, everything is easier there, but ... for editing, you must first somehow grab everything on a PC / Mac.  And the process of "grabbing" does not improve the quality, I tell you.  But there is a plus of such cameras - everything that is captured will always be an archive waiting in the wings if the discs are not discarded and stored according to all the rules.  And the quality of the cameras is very much so in principle. <br><br>  <i>Disks and MDs - this is such an average option when you really need to save money, but you really don't need shit.</i>  <i>There are some peculiarities, but they say it's a matter of habit.</i>  <i>By the way, as in the case of cassettes, the cameras have a hole for the memory card, but only for still images (of what quality).</i>  <i>And by the way, such a naive delusion - like a video camera, this is cooler, because you can take snapshots from a video and take pictures.</i>  <i>Here in the version with these two cameras - not exactly, because it will still be creepy like that.</i> <br><br>  And the third option is HDD cameras.  Type write to the hard disk separate files.  Exactly in this version, you can really break off by buying a camera that‚Äôs 60 years old, and then, after filming, come home, connect the camera to a PC / Mac, rummage through the camera folders and don‚Äôt find any video files.  Cool?  Here I am about too. <br><br>  Some SONY cameras are in mpg format, some in mts (like mine), maybe there are more options.  I think other manufacturers could come up with some other formats.  Sellers of absolutely every camera in the supermarket will not be able to give you a clear answer, so I recommend ‚Äúgoogle tyrnet‚Äù on the topic ‚Äúin what format the camera I chose writes‚Äù before buying.  Although, in principle, in some shops, especially in MediaMarkt, you can easily pass the camera without any problems within 10 days, for any idiotic reason, a la "did not fit into the interior" (tried). <br><br>  <i>(If you are not working on a poppy then skip the next two paragraphs)</i> <br><br>  Therefore, having bought a camera that writes in mpg format, Mac users do the following: either they only watch the entire ~ VLC player, or buy (or search torrents) a paid addition to the QuickTime player, in order not only to watch, but also to mount mpg- files in the program iMovie / FinalCutStudio / other.  By the way, I install in iMovie'06, because iMovie'08 is generally more complicated, but the output is to get super quality oh how difficult ... <br><br>  Or they are preparing for dancing with a tambourine (as I do), having bought a camera that writes in the mts format.  Here you need to find the magic mts-recoder, buy it (or search for a broken one, which I didn‚Äôt manage at the time) and puzzle over why the sound in the video is faster than the video sequence itself.  There is an option - MPEG Stream recoder, but it will still require MPG support to buy it on the Apple website.  Gad ... In short hemorrhagic and only.  By the way, yes, for the format of MTS.  Do you know such a disc called ‚ÄúBlu ray‚Äù?  That's it in the MTS format video is written to these doroguschy drives.  How?  You do not need this? !!!  How I envy you ... -))) <br><br>  So gentlemen, really only two options for you.  Srednyachkovy - the camera writes on disks / minidiski.  In principle, such cameras are at the heap of people, and they live in a niche.  And the "cool" option - when the camera writes to the hard disk (HDD), and for more immodest grandmas writes you in the highest possible quality for today (ie, Ponte finally above the roof). <br><br>  So now you can split all video cameras into three categories and swim only in the right one.  In principle, the ‚Äúthe more expensive the better‚Äù logic works in the case of cameras, therefore when choosing a camera it is better to be guided not by the possible minimum, but by the maximum possible. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/30377/">https://habr.com/ru/post/30377/</a></p>
