In addition, there was a desire to go to warm countries.  The desire to arrange everything in the old manner was not, because  there was no time to stand in line all day. <br><br>  The state gave us a democratic opportunity to choose between the old generation of a passport and the new one.  The choice fell immediately on a <b>new</b> generation for the following reasons: <br><ul><li>  Once done and use 10 years. </li><li>  No need to be photographed separately and carry photos. </li><li>  The very fact that this is a new generation, not the old one. </li></ul><br>  This idea was liked by a friend, so they started to do everything in parallel. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the office of Rostelecom, a code was received for registration on the portal of public services.  Since the public services portal is not very popular yet, there were no queues for issuing a code and everything went in 2 minutes. <br><br>  Separately, I will say that getting the code and registration on the portal itself, went quickly and smoothly.

      The application was easy to fill out.  I chose the nearest office where I would like to get a passport. <br>  The only thing that embarrassed them was reverse questions, to which the answer was not so obvious. <br><br>  And so it came to filling the place of work over the past 10 years.  And it just so happened that the last half of the year at school just fell under this.  I decided not to specify the school.  I continued filling out the application.  The main inconvenience caused, that it was impossible to go to any point of the application at once, in order to see what needs to be written there.  And having reached the photo, I realized that it would be impossible to continue just like that.  Closed the statement, since it is saved. <br><br>  Not much time has passed, a photo scan appeared that met the criteria.  Decided to continue filling. <br><br>  And faced with such inconveniences: <br><ul><li>  I had to re-thumb through all the pages. </li><li>  The floor field was not saved; in the future it was necessary to choose it every time, while continuing to fill out the application. </li></ul><br><br>  February 6, 2012 successfully sent the application, it passed the automatic check, but the check by the employee of the FMS (07.02.2012) did not pass with the wording: <br><blockquote>  In the column ‚Äúinformation about labor activity‚Äù of your application, you must indicate the labor activity for the last 10 years, i.e.  from 07.2001 to the present!  (including study, work or military service).  The interval between the date of dismissal and the date of the next admission to work, school or military service should not exceed one to two months. <br></blockquote><br><br>  From where date 07.2001 undertook - it is not known (it obviously did not get in the last 10 years).  A friend had the same thing, only the date was not 07.2001, but some other one.  Although the performer was the same. <br><br>  The application was quickly redone, but this time the date ranges did not pass the test (implemented through JavaScript).  After much torment, the removal of all the fields and the new filling, I finally managed to continue filling out the application. <br><br>  On February 7, 2012 the application was submitted again, it passed the automatic check, but the check by the FMS employee (08.02.2012) did not pass with the same wording. <br><br>  When I tried to find a mistake and resubmit the application, it turned out that half of the fields in the column ‚Äúinformation about labor activity‚Äù were corrupted.  Rather, some were missing, and some were duplicated. <br><br>  This column was filled out anew, but as practice has shown, it is necessary to indicate ‚Äúdid not work‚Äù if it did not work for more than 1 month, although it was written about 2 months.  Otherwise, the test did not pass. <br><br>  After all the corrections, the application went off successfully, and all the checks passed.  A friend had problems with the correct name of the place of work. <br><br>  In general, on one and the same date (January 10, 2012), both my and my friend‚Äôs application is being tested by an employee of the FMS with the wording: <br><blockquote>  Your application for an international passport has been accepted for review.  You will be informed additionally about the readiness of the documents or about the refusal to issue a passport, within the statutory period, which is one month from the day the application is accepted for consideration. <br></blockquote><br><br>  It takes exactly 3 weeks and a letter arrives in the mail (a friend receives the same thing), which says: <br><blockquote>  ... <br>  To obtain a passport of the <b>old</b> type, you need to arrive ... 07.03.2012 ... <br></blockquote><br><br>  <b>Old</b> sample?  Although I remember exactly what I filled for the new sample.  In this case, the address where to come is necessary - not the one that I chose, but the one that stood in the statement in the first paragraph.  If for the place I chose - 10 minutes to get to, then the place indicated in the letter is at the opposite end of the city.  It is not known what was the point of giving the choice of the place of receiving the service. <br><br>  We are at a loss.  I call the performer (her phone number is specified in the letter). <br>  The conversation goes next: <br><blockquote>  She: Hello.  // I thought the number was wrong, because  the girl did not introduce herself and did not name the department where I got. <br>  Me: Hello, I applied for the issuance of a new type of passport through the portal of public services, but in response I received a letter in which it was said about obtaining an old passport.  Although I accurately filled out for the new sample. <br>  She: What is the last name? <br>  I: // called the name, she began to check something <br>  She: You filed an application 3 times, there were 2 returns, the third was accepted.  All 3 times the application was on an old-style passport. <br>  I: I remember exactly what I filled for the new sample. <br>  She: You must be mistaken.  You probably applied through public services version 2.0? <br>  I: Yes, through them. <br>  She: Many people have such a mistake, who made it through version 2.0.  But this is your mistake, because you haven't figured it out.  We received statements all the time only for the old sample. <br>  I: But I need a new sample. <br>  She: If you want a new sample, then cancel this application, then create anew. <br></blockquote><br><br>  Apparently you will have to do the old passport, because  wait a month again (at best) until they consider the application, somehow I don‚Äôt really want to. <br><br>  Findings: <br><ul><li>  There is e-government, but there is little sense from it if it is not able to adequately perform one of the most sought-after services.  Besides, why keep all versions?  It would be better to bring one to mind. </li><li>  The portal is made quite crooked and requires more long fixes. </li><li>  Assistance in filling out an application is minimal.  Without an additional call or response from the staff - to fill in correctly is quite problematic. </li><li>  Not nearly saves time.  If the application is submitted, it will be executed within the period prescribed by law, not earlier, not later. </li></ul><br><br>  In general, if there is a desire to get a passport without problems and in a timely manner, it is easier to personally come and submit an application to the FMS.  Once it‚Äôs better to wait in line, it‚Äôs better than 10 times to rewrite applications and each time wait for verification and response. <br><br>  PS We have just been informed of the "joyful" news that on March 7, 2012, the FMS is open from 10:00 to 13:00 (ie, 3 hours), which by itself implies a queue, since  all people will come in the morning. <br><br>  PPS Since a friend tied his cell number, they called him and said that they worked until 13 o'clock.  Then about the conversation went like this: <br><blockquote>  Friend: Why did I choose one place and go to another? <br>  She: The old passport is issued only with us. <br>  Friend: Why is an old sample passport I actually filled out for a new one? <br>  She: We received a statement for the old sample. <br></blockquote><br><br>  UPD: Getting a passport went very quickly.  There are no queues, for those who through the Internet made out - in general a separate window that deals only with these things.  In general, it took 40 minutes.  Of which <br>  10 minutes waiting for the window to open (they already had the turmoil on March 8), 10 minutes any signatures and formalities, 20 minutes of waiting when the passport is printed. <br><br>  But I ran into an interesting feature filling in the questionnaire.  For questions: <br>  1) Are you called up for military service or are you sent to alternative civilian service? <br>  2) Are you convicted of committing a crime or brought as an accused? <br>  3) Do you evade the obligations imposed by the court? <br>  You must answer NO, not YES. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/139267/">https://habr.com/ru/post/139267/</a></p>
