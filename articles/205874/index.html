But the main reason is that there are enough computers on the market for x86-compatible processors, the size of which is <b><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/search/%3Fq%3D%5Braspberry%2Bpi%5D%26target_type%3Dposts">Raspberry Pi</a></b> and costing only $ 5- $ 35 more expensive, and this makes porting not only impossible, but also useless.  So that readers would not say that a $ 40 x86-compatible computer is a ‚Äúspherical horse in a vacuum,‚Äù I decided to write a review cycle of 3 articles on several such computers.  Immediately, I‚Äôll make a reservation that the articles aren‚Äôt being sponsored - I bought all this iron with my own money, and I‚Äôm testing Hummingbirds for parts of it almost every week - has it become, by chance, <i><b>too slow</b></i> ?  Who cares - I ask under the cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ad3/a1d/e10/ad3a1de1007305102c63cf6c45db1b77.png" align="right">  Those who thought that the Taiwanese manufacturer of x86-compatible processors are called <b><a href="http://www.via.com.tw/">VIA</a></b> , I will reveal a terrible secret: it turns out, in addition to <b>Intel</b> , <b>AMD</b> and <b>VIA</b> , now there are other manufacturers who hold insignificant market shares of x86 CPU (less than 1%).  One of these manufacturers is <a href="http://www.dmp.com.tw/"><b>DMP Electronics</b></a> , and it is about her that will be discussed in my articles. <br><br>  For transparency purposes, I note that Intel also has <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/202894/">at least one card (Arduino Galileo) the size of Raspberry Pi</a> , which sells <a href="http://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Intel/GALILEO/%3Fqs%3D%252Fha2pyFaduiDmTPuRVOJoC4FOrrIL%25252b1yTKtPT4H7gObokptm8E4G%252FQ%253D%253D">for $ 69 (not including shipping)</a> .  If the size is not so important, and the <b>Mini-ITX</b> form factor also suits you, then you can buy the <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/motherboards/desktop-motherboards/desktop-board-D2500HN.html">Intel Desktop Board D2500HN</a> for about $ 60 (not including RAM, + $ 10).  But Intel will be able to talk about its motherboards better than me, since they have their own corporate blog on Habr√© <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/comment_images/695/2d8/8b9/6952d88b9d31a7a636afc5fe977b3ca7.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>DM &amp; P Group was</b> established in 1989, and consists of several divisions: <br><ul><li>  Actually <b>DMP Electronics</b> itself, which produces x86-compatible <a href="http://www.vortex86dx.com/"><b>Vortex86</b></a> processors </li><li>  The division of <b><a href="http://www.icop.com.tw/">ICOP Technology</a></b> , which produces embedded (embedded) boards based on these processors </li><li>  <b><a href="http://www.compactpc.com.tw/">CompactPC</a></b> division, which produces industrial <b>eBox</b> computers <b>based</b> on the above mentioned boards </li><li>  <s>Not quite an independent</s> unit of <b><a href="http://www.toypc.tw/">ToyPC</a></b> , which <b><a href="http://www.toypc.tw/">removes</a></b> <s>all the stuffing from the aluminum case of eBox computers, and inserts it into the</s> plastic <b>Edubook</b> and <b>KeyboardPC</b> case </li><li>  The <b><a href="http://www.roboard.com/">Roboard</a></b> division, which produces boards and controllers for robots, naturally, using their own processors. </li></ul><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Hidden text</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Why do these Taiwanese have a separate website for each unit, with different designs and conflicting information, I can‚Äôt understand - in my opinion, this only creates confusion and makes it difficult to quickly find the right product, and in the absence of cross-references between different sites, it can also to suggest that they are different manufacturers, although in reality they are the same manufacturer.  <s>But not my moped - I write as it is.</s> </div></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/70d/9b5/405/70d9b5405028d85533e524edc53e1085.png"></div><br>  DMP Electronics began its journey with the release of an i386-compatible processor licensed by <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_Laboratories_Incorporated">ALi</a></b> .  The <b>ALi M6117C processor</b> included the core, which is a copy of the Intel 386SX and runs at 25-40 MHz, and the built-in <b>ALi M1217B</b> chipset.  DMP slightly refined the processor to fit your needs, and called it <b>ALi M6117D</b> .  The processor was produced in the form of the 208-pin <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/QFP">PQFP Package</a> , and had the following characteristics ( <i>copy as it is from the DMP website</i> ): <br><ol><li>  Intel <sup>TM</sup> 386SX core (5V - 25-40MHz Operation) </li><li>  Supports EDO DRAM controller including FP mode (4 Bank) </li><li>  Coprocessor interface </li><li>  ISA interface </li><li>  Peripheral Interface (includes two cascaded 8237 DMA controllers, a 74612 memory mapper, 2 cascaded 8259 interrupt controller, and a 8254 programmer counter) </li><li>  Built-in RTC </li><li>  Programmable 2 channels chip select </li><li>  Built-in PS2 Keyboard Controller and Mouse </li><li>  Built-in WATCHDOG timer </li><li>  16-bits GPI / O via SD bus and 16-bits independent GPIO </li><li>  IDE interface </li></ol><br>  Based on the M6117D processor, the ICOP division produced embedded boards and even <a href="http://www.dmp.com.tw/rsip/">ready-made devices</a> .  The M6117D was produced before 2007, when the <a href="http://www.vortex86sx.com/%3Fpage_id%3D83">Vortex86SX / DX</a> was replaced.  Full specifications and a block diagram of the processor were posted on the DMP website, but about a year ago they were removed from there, due to the loss of use.  For those who wish, the page <a href="http://www.dmp.com.tw/tech/m6117d/">is accessible via the Web Archive</a> .  From the point of view of KolibriOS, this processor is not interesting, since KolibriOS requires a minimum i586-compatible processor to work with (I only told about it for the sake of completeness).

SiS is better known as a manufacturer of video cards and chipsets for motherboards, but 10 years ago it also released its own processors for embedded systems.  The line of processors was called <a href="http://www.cpushack.com/SC55x.html"><b>SiS 55x</b></a> , and was, in turn, based on the processor <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rise_mP6"><b>Rise mP6</b></a> , the rights to which, together with the production technology, SiS bought in 1999 from <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rise_Technology">Rise Technology</a></b> .  DMP licensed the SiS550 processor, modified it a bit to fit your needs, and released it under the name <b>Vortex86 (M6127D)</b> .  <font color="blue"><i>I‚Äôll say right away that this name caused a lot of confusion, since one of its variants, M6127D, differed only in one number from M6117D, which I mentioned above, but at the same time had nothing to do with it (except for the manufacturer).</i></font>  <font color="blue"><i>The other variant of the name, Vortex86, was confused by many in the future with the Vortex86SX released several years later, with which it also had nothing to do.</i></font> <br><br>  Vortex86 is a <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25BA%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5">system</a> -on- <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25BA%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5">chip</a> (System-on-a-Chip, SoC): the chip in the 686-pin <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/BGA">BGA package</a> was manufactured using 180nm process technology and included, in addition to a Pentium-compatible processor with support for FPU and MMX instructions operating at a frequency of 200MHz, also built-in north bridge, graphics card and south bridge: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ba8/a5d/158/ba8a5d15848a9b8af46b702311c08d4e.gif"><br>  Full processor information <a href="http://www.vortex86.com/index2.html">is available on the DMP website</a> .

The eBox-2300 computer on its base was still being sold for some time (obviously, from the old stocks from the warehouse), but already in 2010 almost in all the stores selling them hung the ‚ÄúOut of stock‚Äù sign.  No information about why this was done, I could not find on the Internet;  on the website of the company it is also absent.  Probably, the disclaimer published at the very bottom of the page on the site <a href="http://www.dmp.com.tw/">www.dmp.com.tw</a> will serve as a <a href="http://www.dmp.com.tw/">tip</a> : <br><blockquote>  <font color="blue">Notice: MMP Technology by TPL Group:</font> <font color="blue"><br></font>  <font color="blue">DMP has a Microprocessor Patent (MMP) Portfolio from the TPL Group on <b>Sep.</b></font>  <font color="blue"><b>7 2007</b> .</font>  <font color="blue">MMP technology (ie ‚ÄúImplementations‚Äù).</font>  <font color="blue">There is no need for a TPL.</font>  <font color="blue">You may be required to use the TPL.</font>  <font color="blue">Contact: mmp-licensing@tplgroup.net</font> </blockquote>  This disclaimer may well be directly related to what happened, since the second processor of the Vortex86 series ( <b>Vortex86SX</b> ) was released in 2007. <br><br>  To release the second processor of the Vortex86 line (and the third one from the DMP company), she again did what she did the last 2 times: she bought a license to manufacture (and refine) the processor from another company.  This time, <a href="http://www.rdc.com.tw/en/index.php"><b>RDC Semiconductor</b></a> (another Taiwanese manufacturer of x86-compatible processors, even less well-known than DMP Electronics itself) acted as the seller. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/004/da8/a48/004da8a485996675e2cbd0a44cee4eb2.jpg" align="left"><br>  Today, the Vortex86 processor line includes 7 processors (except for the original Vortex86, made under the SiS license, all other processors were based on the RDC <b><a href="http://www.rdc.com.tw/en/product/iad.php">IAD 100xx</a></b> family of processors).  However, unlike the M6117D and Vortex86, which are almost a complete copy of their ‚Äúancestors‚Äù, there is more diversity in the new processors: some technologies were taken from the same SiS, and DMP Electronics introduced some of the design.  For example, the RDC design consists of 2 chips (the first is CPU + North Bridge, the second is South Bridge), while the DMP design is still SoC (1 chip including CPU, North Bridge and South Bridge).  I could not find any information about what part of the processor the RDC Semiconductor technologies are now (and what technology is DMP Electronics and / or SiS), and it is also missing on the company's website.  According to datasheets we can talk about about 70-80% similarity. <br><br>  Anyway, the result of this turn was an interesting curiosity: the second processor of the Vortex86 line (based on most RDC Semiconductor technologies) was <b><u>worse</u></b> in performance and performance than the first processor (made using SiS technologies).  The third ( <b>Vortex86DX</b> ) caught up with the first, and only starting from the fourth, did the processors become better than the first.  But about this - in the next part. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/205874/">https://habr.com/ru/post/205874/</a></p>
