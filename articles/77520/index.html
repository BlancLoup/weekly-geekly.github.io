I work in the IT-company Nanosoft ( <a href="http://www.nanocad.ru/">www.nanocad.ru</a> ), the development team of which has released a free basic CAD platform.  For those who are in the know, I think it will be interesting to read this article.  For those who don‚Äôt, read anyway, find out in which direction modern Russian software is developing for engineers.  To begin, a little explain the terms.  CAD - computer-aided design.  Simply put, a system that allows you to create projects on a computer without using a pencil and drawing board.  It, <br>  Of course, a very superficial interpretation.  Besides the fact that it is convenient to do the drawing itself, it allows you to automate operations, especially standard ones.  For example, it gives you the opportunity to make your own settings for the thickness of the lines, or to prompt ‚Äúhere you need to put another pipe, the diameter of the current does not match‚Äù and much more.

      A bit of history. <a name="habracut"></a>  The beginning of the development of Western CAD systems was in the 60s, by the 80s those ‚Äúmonsters‚Äù had already formed that are still present on the market.  Basically, this is of course the western companies.  Russia was not lucky - the active development of CAD-systems coincided with the restructuring and it was not up to the software, later the pirates were brought up.  Nevertheless, some of our companies are still engaged in writing their own systems, as well as additional applications for Western products.  Despite the fact that Nanosoft is a young company, its foundation <br>  laid the people actively developing the domestic CAD in those years. <br><br>  Why do you have to make your own applications in Russia?  First of all, because of the notorious GOST.  De jure, they now act as recommendations, but de facto they are still valid and are constantly being refined.  That is why the Western system cannot be used without adaptation to Russian realities, we need plug-ins or additional programs. <br><br>  According to our estimates, in Russia, 75% of unlicensed CAD users.  Of the rest, 10 percent buy the platform, but use unlicensed applications, 15 percent completely switch to licensed software.  At the same time, half of the profits from sales, again, according to our estimates, somewhere around 6 billion rubles (before the crisis), goes abroad.  The price of Western CAD licenses is several thousand dollars.  The main share of payments - the cost of the platform, without which it is impossible to work in specialized applications.  Moreover, basically all sapra are sold by subscription, once missed - pay again. <br><br>  In the conditions of crisis, to facilitate the transition to licensed software for our Russian enterprises, we decided to make a Russian CAD platform.  And to make it free, because we believe that at this stage, paying for the platform is not relevant.  To this "basis" to release applications for little money and work on the subscription system, when the user extends his subscription for a year as needed.  Plus, the payment for software comes mainly through the site, which <br>  also new enough for our complex market. <br><br>  Launching your own CAD platform is a difficult and responsible business.  They created at a frantic pace and worked for wear and tear for about a year and a half, and now they made the first pre-release - nanoCAD 2.0.  Legally, it can be used without restrictions, everything is licensed, all according to the law.  Later we will open the API so that other developers can adapt their applications to our platform. <br><br>  Immediately I foresee the question - under which axis they have developed.  Under Windows.  Under Linux, they have not yet mastered it, but there is no urgent need at the moment - the users of the product overwhelmingly work under Win.  In the future, after polishing this version, it can be done under Linux.  First of all, we are faced with the task of polishing the first (!) Russian free CAD system and working out the final specification taking into account the opinions of users, because we are well aware that we need a product with which everyone will be comfortable to work.  Now we have already started receiving feedback.  Of course, there are also reviews like "garbage", although we need feedback like "here you have a bug, here is the log."  We make this product free for all Russian users, so the response is important. <br>  more than ever.  Therefore, I ask Habra Party to test the software, if there are people who understand, or tell your friends, those who work on such programs. <br><br>  That's all. <br><br>  PS: share an invitation with a girl?  And then I can not even answer the comments. <br><br>  PPS: we are looking for good programmers for bitrix on a constant (take this opportunity). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/77520/">https://habr.com/ru/post/77520/</a></p>
