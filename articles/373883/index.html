This year, a few days ago, <a href="http://comsol.com/c/66vd"><strong>COMSOL 5.3a</strong></a> was shown. </p><br><p>  Briefly about the most significant planned innovations: </p><br><ol><li>  In <strong>acoustic applications</strong> , incl.  with joint calculations of acoustic waves and vibrations in elastic bodies (acoustic-structure interactions), the possibility of using the boundary element method (BEM) for conducting <strong>hybrid FEM-BEM modeling has been</strong> added.  Recall that the current version 5.3 already supports BEM and FEM-BEM for problems of <a href="http://comsol.ru/c/66v3">corrosion</a> and <a href="http://comsol.ru/c/65v9">electrostatics</a> , as well as for setting arbitrary systems of equations. <br><blockquote>  The image above shows the result of calculation in the FEM-BEM formulation of the sound pressure level (SPL) around the speaker.  In this form, the model contains 125 thousand finite elements, 20 thousand boundary elements and about 250 thousand degrees of freedom (DoF).  Solving such a problem solely by the finite element method would require about half a billion finite elements to achieve comparable accuracy. <br></blockquote></li><li>  Expansion of <a href="http://comsol.ru/c/66vn">geometric acoustics</a> : added ability to calculate <strong>impulse responses</strong> . </li><li>  Supports hybrid <strong>FEM-BEM computing for magnetostatics</strong> . </li><li>  New material model for strength calculations: shape memory alloys. </li><li>  A new method for modeling <strong>plasma with capacitive coupling</strong> . </li><li>  Support for 3DConnexion¬Æ SpaceMouse¬Æ devices. </li><li>  <strong>Boundary condition</strong> for modeling flowing <strong>turbulent flows</strong> in solving CFD problems. </li><li>  Expansion of the library of materials: 150 new materials and 1300 new properties of materials, including  for <a href="http://comsol.ru/c/66w7">microwave calculations</a> (bundled with the Radio Frequency module) a database with the relevant properties of the substrates is added. </li></ol><br><p>  The release is scheduled for November-December this year. </p><br><h1>  Invited speakers announced on COMSOL day in Moscow </h1><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/db/77/59db77b644ef0706919519.png" alt="image"></p><br><p>  In the very near future, on October 26, Moscow will host the next Russian <a href="http://comsol.ru/c/65s7">day COMSOL</a> . </p><br><p>  The event program is designed for a full day and consists of live demonstrations, practical mini-courses, as well as consultations with COMSOL specialists.  Invited speakers will share practical experience of using the package in such areas as MEMS technology, optics and electrochemistry. </p><br><p>  Among the mini-courses, both general and specialized are planned.  For example, two sessions will be devoted to an overview of the main features of the software, including a digest of the latest innovations ( <a href="http://comsol.ru/c/66vx">version 5.3</a> and 5.3a) and a live demonstration of the package. </p><br><p>  The specialized mini-courses will be held: </p><br><ul><li>  Analysis of COMSOL Multiphysics <sup>¬Æ</sup> functional for modeling electromagnetic processes: low-frequency electrical engineering and electrician, microwave and optical calculations in various formulations (full-wave tasks and techniques of geometric optics) </li><li>  Overview of the construction and configuration of interdisciplinary integrated models </li><li>  Practical lesson post-processing of simulation results and the visualization and export of data from the computational model </li><li>  Demonstration of solving problems in geometric, parametric and topological optimization, as well as inverse problems using <a href="http://comsol.ru/c/66db">optimization</a> methods </li></ul><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/db/85/59db85aeb54f8547077175.jpeg" alt="image"></p><br><p>  One of the key objectives of the event is to provide a platform for communication and exchange of experience between various COMSOL users.  <a href="http://comsol.com/c/65rx">Here</a> and <a href="http://comsol.com/c/66dl">here</a> you can get acquainted with presentations on the topic of modeling electrical systems and arc discharge in electronics from last year's COMSOL day in Skolkovo. </p><br><p>  Among the invited speakers for this year: </p><br><p>  Sergey Popkov, Federal State Unitary Enterprise Federal Research-Industrial Center NIIIS  Yu.E.  Sedakova ", Nizhny Novgorod <br>  <b>Development of integrated membrane-based strain gauge transducers in COMSOL Multiphysics <sup>¬Æ</sup></b> </p><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Abstract of the report and information about the author</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><p>  The report is devoted to numerical engineering modeling of MEMS components.  The paper discusses a number of stages in designing a sensitive element (SE) or primary transducer of a microsensor pressure. <br>  Using COMSOL Multiphysics <sup>¬Æ</sup> , a finite-element calculation of the mechanical stresses caused by thermal expansion ‚Äî compression between the FE membrane and the reference crystal ‚Äî was carried out, and the effect of the resulting strains on the output characteristics of the FE was investigated.  The results of studies of mechanical stresses are considered - their distribution both in the JE membrane and in the system of the reference crystal - sensor body. </p><br><p>  Sergey Popkov is a senior researcher at the <a href="http://www.niiis.nnov.ru/">Federal State Unitary Enterprise Federal</a> Research and <a href="http://www.niiis.nnov.ru/">Production Institute NIIIS of them.</a>  <a href="http://www.niiis.nnov.ru/">Yu.E.</a>  <a href="http://www.niiis.nnov.ru/">Sedakova "</a> and in parallel is engaged in scientific activities at UNN.  N.I.  Lobachevsky. <br>  In 2014, he received the degree of Ph.D.  in the specialty "Physics of semiconductors".  Research interests include the study of shallow and deep donor centers in monoisotopic silicon, defects in bulk material and heterostructures, the development of sensitive elements of microsystem engineering devices (MCT). </p></div></div><br><p>  Alexander Shalin, ITMO University, St. Petersburg <br>  <b>Calculation of optical and plasmon forces in COMSOL Multiphysics <sup>¬Æ</sup></b> </p><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Abstract of the report and information about the author</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><p>  The main methods of implementing the calculation of optical forces in COMSOL Multiphysics <sup>¬Æ</sup> will be considered using both the built-in Maxwell stress tensor and using own equations.  Comparison with analytical calculation will be made, discrepancies are analyzed.  Next, we will consider a dipole nanoparticle located on a plasmon substrate, which is irradiated by a plane wave at an angle or a Gaussian beam.  It is shown that in this case it is possible to excite unidirectional plasmons that make a significant contribution to the optical power and lead to the emergence of new optomechanical effects, such as the attraction of a nanoparticle to a source, the amplification of an optical trap, the pushing of a nanoparticle from a beam, and optical sorting. </p><br><p>  Shalin Alexander Sergeevich, Doctor of Physics and Mathematics, head.  lab  <a href="http://optomech.ifmo.ru/ru/91555/">"Nano-optomechanics" ITMO University</a> .  Field of interest: optics, optomechanics, dielectric plasmonics, photonics, photovoltaics, meta-surfaces. </p><br><p>  The laboratory team leads <a href="https://vk.com/nano_optomechanics_lab">an excellent public in VK</a> , where it monitors current work in the field of optics and the use of COMSOL Multiphysics <sup>¬Æ</sup> in them. </p></div></div><br><p>  Oksana Limanovskaya, UrFU them.
