      ‚ÄúEmancipating human attention can be a moral and political battle defining our time,‚Äù writes James Williams, a 36-year-old technologist who became a philosopher and author of the recently published book <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/stand-out-of-our-light/3F8D7BA2C0FE3A7126A4D9B73A89415D">Stand Out of Our Light</a> . <br><br>  Who does not know about this, as not Williams.  During his ten-year tenure at Google, he was engaged in contextual advertising, helping to improve a powerful, data-based advertising model.  Gradually, he began to feel that his life, as he had known it before, began to collapse.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs as if the earth has started to leave from under the feet,‚Äù he writes. <br><br>  And, most likely, he would not be surprised by the increasing incidence of attention disorders, such as with Pablo Sandoval, who was the third baseman in the Red Sox, and in the middle of the game decided to check his Instagram (for which he was removed by the club).  Or the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/10/theater/hold-the-phone-its-patti-lupone.html">incident with Patty Lupon</a> , which also occurred in 2015, when the actress took the phone from the girl in the hall. <br><br>  Williams compares modern technology with the "whole army of aircraft and tanks" designed to catch and hold our attention.  And this army is winning.  We spend whole days chained to the screens, our thumb twitches in the subway and elevators or when we glance at the traffic lights. <br><br>  At first we are proud of it, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/20/technology/personaltech/surviving-and-thriving-in-a-one-monitor-world.html">then we regret</a> the habit of having the so-called second screen, when one monitor is no longer enough, and, for example, we watch the latest news in the phone while we watch TV. <br><br>  A study conducted by Nokia in 2013 found that we check our phones on average 150 times a day.  But we touch them 2617 times a day - according to a <a href="https://blog.dscout.com/mobile-touches">study in</a> 2016, which was organized by the company Dscout. <br><br>  Apple <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/18/11454976/apple-iphone-use-data-unlock-stats">confirms</a> that users remove the lock from their iPhones about 80 times a day.  Now screens have appeared where they have never been before: on the tables at McDonald's;  in the locker rooms where we are most vulnerable;  in the back of a taxi.  For only $ 12.99 you can buy an iPhone <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Emmzoe-Smartphone-Handlebar-Stroller-Shopping/dp/B01G7JWQDQ">case for a baby carriage</a> ... or two (shudders). <br><br>  These are us: glassy eyes, an open mouth, a crooked neck, caught in a dopamine loop and pulled into an information bubble.  Our attention is sold to advertisers, along with our data, and returned to us back tattered and shattered. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dk/u0/g7/dku0g7ke7sx9lsbspogs-dbnr_u.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>You get chaos</b> <br><br>  Williams speaks on Skype from his home in Moscow, where his wife, who works at the UN, was sent on a one-year business trip. <br><br>  By descent from Abilene (Texas), he began to work at Google in that period, which can still be called early, and when the company in its idealism resisted an existing advertising model.  Williams left Google in 2013 to conduct research for a doctoral degree at Oxford on the philosophy and ethics of persuading attention to design. <br><br>  Now Williams is worried about "interned" people losing the meaning of life. <br><br>  ‚ÄúYou pull out the phone to do something, and you are distracted, and after 30 minutes you find yourself doing a dozen other things, except for the one for which the phone was originally taken.  At this level, there is fragmentation and absent-mindedness, he says.  ‚ÄúBut it also seemed to me that at the long-term level there is something else that is difficult to keep in view: the perspective of what you are doing.‚Äù <br><br>  He knew that among his colleagues was not the only one who experienced this.  Speaking at a technology conference in Amsterdam last year, Williams asked about 250 developers in the room: ‚ÄúHow many of you want to live in the world you create?  In a world where technology competes for your attention? ‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúNot a single hand went up,‚Äù he says. <br><br>  Williams is far from the only example of how a former big-tech soldier (if you continue the army metaphor) is now trying to bring his danger to clear water. <br><br>  At the end of June, Tristan Harris, a former developer of Google, took the stage at the Aspen Ideas Festival to warn us that at least ‚Äúexistential threat‚Äù hangs from our own gadgets. <br><br>  Red and thin, 34-year-old Harris has been playing an informant since he left Google five years ago.  He opened the Human Technology Center in San Francisco and travels around the country, appearing in authoritative shows and podcasts, for example, in ‚Äú60 Minutes‚Äù and ‚ÄúAwakening‚Äù, as well as at glamorous conferences, as in Aspen, for stories about how technologies against which it is impossible to resist. <br><br>  He likes the chess analogy.  When Facebook or Google directs the attention of their ‚Äúsupercomputers‚Äù towards our consciousness, he says, ‚Äúthis is check and check.‚Äù <br><br>  In the innocent days of 2013, when Williams and Harris were still working at Google together, they met in conference rooms and outlined their thoughts on the lecture boards: the club of two concerned at the epicenter of the economy attention. <br><br>  Since then, the views of both have become larger and more topical.  The constant pressure of technology on human attention concerns not only the loss of time of our so-called ‚Äúreal lives‚Äù on online entertainment.  Now, they say, we risk completely losing our moral orientation. <br><br>  ‚ÄúTechnology is changing our ability to understand what is true, so we have less and less understanding of the shared truth, the shared point of view with which we all agree,‚Äù Harris says the day after her performance in Aspen.  ‚ÄúWhen there is no shared truth or shared facts, you get chaos ... And people can take control in their own hands." <br><br>  Of course, companies can also make a profit out of this - big and small.  Of course, there was a whole industry to combat the advent of technology.  The once free pleasures, for example, a short day nap, are now <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/29/nyregion/napping-in-a-new-york-minute.html">monetized</a> with hourly rates.  Those who used to relax with monthly magazines now download meditation applications with an instructor, for example, Headspace ($ 399.99 for a lifetime subscription). <br><br>  The <a href="https://habitlab.stanford.edu/">HabitLab app</a> , developed at Stanford, behaves aggressively every time you get to the red zone of Internet consumption - defined by you.  Reddit absorbs your daytime?  Choose between a ‚Äúminute killer‚Äù that will turn on a strict 60-second timer, and a ‚Äúfreeze of the screen‚Äù that creates an end in the endless list - and you will be thrown away when you press a button. <br><br>  Like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/11/technology/personaltech/apple-iphone-screen-time.html">Moment</a> , this app keeps track of your phone‚Äôs time and sends embarrassing notifications to you or your loved ones, telling you in detail how much time was spent today on Instagram.  To do your job, HabitLab knows your behavior quite well, which leads to confusion.  Obviously, now we need phones to save us from phones. <br><br>  Researchers have long <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24362813">been aware</a> that there is a difference between ‚Äúdownward‚Äù attention (volitional, effortless decisions that we make to pay attention to something of our choice) and ‚Äúupward‚Äù attention when it is involuntarily captured by what happens. around us: a rumble of thunder, the sound of a shot or an enticing sound signal that notifies you of another message on Twitter. <br><br>  But many of the most important questions remain unanswered.  In the first position on this list remains such a mystery as "the relationship between attention and our conscious perception of the world."  This is what Jesse Riesman, a neuroscientist, whose laboratory at the University of California at Los Angeles is studying, learns about attention and memory. <br><br>  The consequences for our tormented neurons from the time spent at the screen are also unclear. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe do not understand how modern technologies and cultural changes affect our ability to maintain focus on our goals,‚Äù says Dr. Rieszman. <br><br>  Britt Anderson, a neuroscientist from the University of Waterloo in Canada, came to the point that in 2011 he called his scientific work as "There is no such thing as attention." <br><br>  Dr. Anderson said that scientists used the word ‚Äúattention‚Äù to denote such different characteristics - attention span, attention deficit, selective attention, spatial attention - that in essence it became meaningless, and at that moment when the word itself is more appropriate than ever before. or. <br><br>  <b>Are the children ... okay?</b> <br><br>  Although attention probably does not exist, many of us mourn his demise.  For example, Mrs. Lupon and other people, including university professors, who are in charge of classrooms. <br><br>  Katherine Hales, an English teacher at the University of California, Los Angeles, wrote about the change she noticed in students: when ‚Äúdeep attention‚Äù, a state of purposeful concentration that can last several hours, changes to ‚Äúhyper-attention‚Äù that jumps from one goal to the other, and prefers to superficially get acquainted with a lot of things, rather than deeply exploring one thing. <br><br>  At Columbia University, where every student must complete a required course and read between 200 and 300 pages every week, teachers discuss how to deal with a marked change in students' ability to cope with assignments.  Lisa Hollibo, the dean of Colombia‚Äôs academic planning, says that the overall required course remains unchanged, but ‚Äúwe constantly think about how to teach when sustainability has changed in the last 50 years.‚Äù <br><br>  It was assumed that in the 90s, from 3 to 5% of American schoolchildren had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.  In 2013, this number reached 11% and continues to grow, according to data from a national study of children's health. <br><br>  Nick Siver, a 32-year-old professor of anthropology at Tufts University, has just completed his second year of teaching the subject, which he calls "How to Pay Attention."  But instead of giving clues about how to focus (which could be suggested), he tells students about attention as a cultural phenomenon.  Dr. Siver says they discuss ‚Äúhow people talk about attention,‚Äù and the course includes topics such as ‚Äúeconomics of attention‚Äù and ‚Äúattention and politics‚Äù. <br><br>  Part of the homework for the ‚Äúeconomic‚Äù week was an analysis of how an application or website ‚Äúgrabs attention‚Äù and benefits from it. <br><br>  Student Morgan Griffiths has chosen YouTube. <br><br>  ‚ÄúMany of the media I consume are about RuPaul's Drag Race,‚Äù says Griffiths.  - At the end of many videos, RuPol itself appears and says: ‚ÄúHey, friends, when the video ends, just open the following, this is called a telezapa, but go ahead, I advise you.‚Äù <br><br>  Her classmate, Jake Rochford, who chose the Tinder app, noticed a strong obsession with the new ‚Äúsuper-like‚Äù button. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWhen the super-like appeared, I noticed that all functions work as a way for me to keep the app open ‚Äî instead of helping me find love,‚Äù Rochford says. <br><br>  After Jake completed this task, he deleted his account. <br><br>  However, Professor Siver is not at all ludd. <br><br>  ‚ÄúExcess information always seems new, but in reality this phenomenon is very old,‚Äù he says.  - For example: "The yard is 16th century, and there are <i>so</i> many books."  Or: "We live in late antiquity, and there are <i>so many</i> scriptures." <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt can't be that there are too many things to pay attention to.  This is not logical, - says Siver.  ‚ÄúBut it may be that there are things that are actively trying to grab your attention." <br><br>  It is necessary to think not only about the attention that we spend, but also about the fact that we receive. <br><br>  Sherry Turkle, a sociologist and psychologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has been writing about our relationship with technology for several decades.  She claims that the devices that follow us everywhere have led to a new trend: children, instead of competing with their brothers and sisters for the attention of their parents, are now competing with iPhones and iPads, Siri and Alexa, Apple watches and computer screens. <br><br>  Every moment they spend with their parents, they also spend along with their parents' need to be constantly in touch.  Turkle in his latest book, Restore Conversation, describes in detail the first generation exposed to this impact.  Now this generation is from 14 to 21 years old. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThere was a generation that had a very unsatisfactory youth, and which in fact does not associate phones with any glamor, but rather with a sense of deprivation,‚Äù she says. <br><br>  At the same time, Turkle is cautiously optimistic: <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe are starting to notice that people are gradually moving in the direction of‚Äú having a good time. ‚Äù  Apple is slowly moving to plead guilty.  And culture itself is moving towards recognizing that this cannot continue. ‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/421099/">https://habr.com/ru/post/421099/</a></p>
