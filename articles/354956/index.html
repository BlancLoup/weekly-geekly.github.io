  <section class="page js-page"><h1>VPN for a beer?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  VPN is now becoming not just relevant, but often a vital service for users of the Internet.  Blocked LinkedIn, indiscriminate shooting of Roskomnadzor, possible blocking of Facebook, Viber and other daily applications, hundreds and thousands of already blocked sites on the network, inability to remain anonymous when using VC, OK, Mail.ru and other "controlled" resources, and many other reasons.  All this makes the Runet people think about their future in this segment of the global network. </p><br><p>  We all have grandmothers, grandfathers, parents, as well as familiar humanities scholars, musicians, housewives and other wonderful people, but forever distant from the "complex" Internet technologies.  Yes, of course, the Internet is full of tutorials and video clips explaining the "simple" process of installing a VPN client.  However, all this does not solve the main task - to make these people do unusual and frightening actions and get, finally, VPN protection. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  In addition, existing VPN services have a number of serious flaws that do not allow me personally to recommend them to my friends for use: </p><br><ol><li>  Free VPN services terrorize their users with endless advertising, and sometimes with a variety of malware.  Not to mention the hidden and unpleasant restrictions on connection speed and traffic volume. </li><li>  Paid VPN services, obviously, scare away their fee.  But this is not the most negative quality of popular and public VPN providers. </li><li>  The most unpleasant thing is, of course, the potential to log and monitor ALL user traffic without his knowledge.  Yes, of course, almost all VPN providers offer their services under the slogan "We do not keep any logs".  But this statement is true or not - it is authentically impossible to know. </li><li>  Large-scale blocking very often includes the IP addresses of all known VPN providers, since  all their servers are easily calculated and can be blacklisted relatively easily. </li></ol><br><p>  All of the above led me recently to an interesting idea, which I would like to share with the message: <strong>to enable technically savvy people (admins) to create a convenient VPN for their friends and acquaintances</strong> . </p><br><p>  The essence of the idea is as follows: </p><br><p>  A service is being created, for example, beervpn.com (VPN for beer :). </p><br><p>  The service offers our admin to quickly and easily <strong>install a VPN on any VPS-ke</strong> .  To do this, the service laid out detailed instructions and ready-made automated scripts for different OSes.  This will allow even novice admins to become a VPN service provider for their friends.  It is obvious that anyone, even a novice admin, will be able to find, buy and configure cheap VPS with enough traffic to serve several tens or even hundreds of people. </p><br><p>  After the VPN is running, we suggest the admin to create a <strong>private channel in the Telegraph</strong> , to which he will add his friends, acquaintances, relatives and others who need a VPN. </p><br><p>  In this channel, users will receive a link to a <strong>mobile app for Android or iOS</strong> , which they will have to install on their mobile device.  Appa will be unique for this admin and, accordingly, for this channel.  By running the app, the user will need to log in through Telegrams.  In the app itself there will be only one button: ON / OFF, which will allow the user to enable and disable VPN on his device.  VPN connection settings will be registered in the app itself.  In addition, the app will constantly check whether the user is a channel subscriber and, if not, will not allow him to use a VPN.  Thus, the admin will be able to manage their VPN users through a private telegram channel! </p><br><p>  In the future, it will be possible to give the administrator the ability to configure several VPN servers, for example, in different countries, and users will have the opportunity to choose the country of connection in the app. </p><br><p>  Obviously, the admin will receive the appu on our service, which will create it for a specific server / server with specific access settings.  And the admin will be able to manage the "creation" of the app, entering the parameters of their VPN servers in his personal account on our service. </p><br><p>  In addition to beauty, this solution has many advantages: </p><br><ol><li>  It is free for the user. </li><li>  It‚Äôs hard to come up with a simpler way to connect to a VPN.  Even for the humanitarian humanitarian itself, to install an app and press one button is quite a feasible task.  Moreover, the proposal to install the app will come from his friend / relative who can help them cope with this task. </li><li>  Block such a VPN is incredibly difficult, because  It is necessary to track the IP address of the VPS server (which is not specified ANYWHERE) and block it for <em>each</em> created app.  And if you make automatic tracking of these locks, you can almost instantly switch IP on the server and client after blocking. </li><li>  The anonymity of the traffic and the absence of logs is guaranteed by the admin himself, whom his friends and relatives decided to confide in. </li><li>  Admin receives regular thanks and beer in return. </li></ol><br><p>  Over time, it is possible to generate and desktop appy and introduce more complex administration of users and servers.  But, it seems to me that even in the described form - it can be an interesting and simple project to implement. </p><br><p>  I will be glad to hear your opinion and criticism. </p><br><p>  Well, all those who lit up the idea - write, let's do it together! </p><br><p>  PS I'm ready to put $ 1k on all development, pay for servers for the service and manage the project. <br>  PPS Who wants to help with the development, testing, project management, design, copyright, whatever, join the telegram group: <a href="https://t.me/beervpn">https://t.me/beervpn</a> </p></div>
