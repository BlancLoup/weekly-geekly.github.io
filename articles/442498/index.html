Eight hundred participants, a rather big hall, world-famous speakers.  A year has passed, but most reports have not lost their relevance.  However, it is not surprising - it is such reports that get into the top according to the participants. </p><br><p>  The format is: </p><br><ul><li>  Required video on YouTube </li><li>  Slides if there is </li><li>  Detailed description of the report in Russian </li><li>  Brief biography of the speaker </li></ul><br><p>  Plus you have Habr's comments to discuss what you see.

A new method has been added to the standard to select a local allocator for containers ( <code>std::pmr</code> ), global <code>tcmalloc</code> and <code>jemalloc</code> continue to evolve, as do the kernel interfaces on which they rely.  This report is devoted to the ‚Äúlower floor‚Äù of the structure: the features of <code>mmap</code> and <code>madvise</code> in the Linux kernel and the influence of these features on the performance of the allocators. </p><br><p>  <strong>About speaker</strong> </p><br><p><img width="200" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/af/tc/jo/aftcjoxcd7i-evyuqchtxepwcgs.jpeg">  Alexey Salmin graduated from the MMF of the NSU, was engaged in symbolic calculations and static analysis, worked at Intel in Novosibirsk.

The library has such standard things like atomics, threads, tasks, locks, condition variables.  The memory model guarantees multi-threaded use of these basic blocks. </p><br><p>  Seven years have passed, practices of safe use of multithreading and a memory model have appeared.  In this report, we will learn in detail about these practices: general rules of multithreading and special rules for both library primitives and the memory model.  The issues addressed cover topics broader than just the C ++ language. </p><br><p>  <strong>About speaker</strong> </p><br><p><img width="200" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bh/7d/ox/bh7dox26upueje-gqfd4ofadglo.jpeg">  Rainer Grimm worked as an architect, team leader and instructor for over 20 years.  In his free time, he enjoys writing articles about C ++, Python, and Haskell, and speaking at conferences.  He maintains the blog "Modern C ++".  Now he is a speaker on the topics of modern C ++ and Python.  O'Reilly and Leanpub publish several of his books: ‚ÄúC ++ 11 f√ºr Programmierer‚Äù, ‚ÄúC ++‚Äù, ‚ÄúC ++ - Standardbiliothek‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe C ++ Standard Library‚Äù. <br clear="all"></p><br><hr><br><h1 id="8-2020-a-void_t-odyssey">  8. 2020: A void_t odyssey </h1><br><p>  <em>Ivan ƒåukiƒá</em> </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dZyH01tyIsA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  <a href="https://2018.cppconf.ru/talks/day-2/track-a/2.pdf">Slides</a> </p><br><p>  In C ++, there has always been a powerful subset of the language for metaprogramming, allowing developers to perform magic tricks like static introspection to ensure polymorphic execution without inheritance.  The problem is that the syntax is very perverted and overly verbose - all this makes metaprogramming a rather daunting task. </p><br><p>  Recent improvements in the standard, combined with new features of C ++ 20, make metaprogramming more simple, and the metaprograms themselves are more readable and understandable. </p><br><p>  In this report, we look at modern metaprogramming techniques, focusing on the <code>void_t</code> magic metafunction. </p><br><p>  By the way, in C ++ Russia 2019 in Moscow, Ivan will give a talk on <a href="https://cppconf.ru/talks/11auqe0dbeawgemasoqws2/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D442498">‚ÄúMove-only C ++ design‚Äù</a> , and also conduct a training session on <a href="https://cppconf.ru/trainings/applied-functional-programming-in-c/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D442498">‚ÄúApplied functional programming in C ++‚Äù</a> : is STL far from functional programming, what are functional objects, std :: invoke and monads , monads, monads.

Modern C ++ has come a long way in simplifying the process of parallel programming by introducing both high-level and low-level abstractions.  C ++ 17 advanced even further and gave us new high-level parallel algorithms, and even more is expected from C ++ 20.  In this report, we will take part in a review of existing utilities for organizing parallelism and look into the future, where GPUs and heterogeneous systems will receive support from new features of the standard library, look at new standards like SYCL. </p><br><p>  <strong>About speaker</strong> </p><br><p><img width="200" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/df/d7/ge/dfd7gedc98ckz7nvemcxwsnmtrm.jpeg">  Simon is a GPGPU toolchain developer focusing on C ++.  Unhealthily loves patterned metaprogramming and the darkest side of the language.

Using them in building architecture, you can make it more expressive and reliable.  Sometimes - very significantly and effectively. </p><br><p>  Have you come to understand your algorithms? </p><br><p>  In this report you will see all 105 algorithms, including those added in 11 and 17 standards.  But this is not just an enumeration - the essence of the report is to show the presence in these algorithms of the system, groups and patterns into which they are organized, and how they relate to each other. </p><br><p>  This big picture is the best way to remember them all and to comprehend as a complete set of tools and ways to make the code more expressive and more reliable. </p><br><p>  <strong>About speaker</strong> </p><br><p><img width="200" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bq/gu/jm/bqgujmdda3wdxrdfnhag914coqa.jpeg">  Jonathan Boccara loves C ++, and especially the writing of clear, expressive code.  In particular, this is why he maintains the ‚ÄúFluent C ++‚Äù blog.  He also works as a senior developer at Murex, where he rolls huge C ++ code bases designed for use in finance.

In this report, we will try to dive deeper into the subject area: analyze what asynchrony is;  when it arises;  how does it affect the code we write and the programming language we use.  We will try to figure out what the futures &amp; promises are about, let's talk a little about the corutines and actors.  Let's touch on JavaScript and operating systems.  The purpose of the report is to make more obvious the trade-offs that arise with a particular approach to developing multi-threaded or distributed software. </p><br><p>  <strong>About speaker</strong> </p><br><p><img width="200" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/t0/ar/cc/t0arccvs0q4e-vo66f6uj1mss8q.jpeg">  Ivan began working in Yandex in 2009 in the department of linguistic technologies in the Search.

In this report, we will speculate a little about why engineers who want to write productive code choose C ++.  John will present a historical perspective on focusing on C ++, tell you how the C ++ community lives right now and where the language and its audience are going.  Recently, everyone has become interested in effective code, from mobile phone manufacturers to large data centers, so C ++ with its open source libraries has again become a hot topic.  This report clearly explains why most engineers choose C ++ for all of this.  There is a general sketch of C ++ in the scale of the story with explanations of the points of growth and falling popularity. </p><br><p>  <strong>About speaker</strong> </p><br><p><img width="200" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/r-/i7/zw/r-i7zwcioq1nvt-ed8bst0uvhvs.jpeg">  John has been working on C ++ for over 20 years.

Recently, this group also took up metaprogramming and made several important decisions about what the possible solution would look like.  In this report we will look into the past that brought us to such a life, and we will discuss the possibilities of native support of ‚Äúreflective metaprogramming‚Äù in the C ++ language. </p><br><p>  <strong>About speaker</strong> </p><br><p><img width="200" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yo/l6/ns/yol6nsli9pcu42zabirattqstqq.jpeg">  David is a Belgian scientist living next to Princeton in the United States.
