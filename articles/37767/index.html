  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Do not tell the customer a mobile phone number!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Usually I never give a mobile number to new customers if they are in another city or region.  And there are good reasons for this, which will be presented in this article. <br><br>  Usually, a mobile phone is used as a means of communication for solving urgent issues, or for setting up a business meeting.  If the client is new, then no urgent issues can be, force majeure does not count.  Discussion of TK is also not an urgent issue, here haste only hurts, and moreover - a telephone conversation can do more harm than good. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  First, the person thinks less when talking.  When you communicate with the customer by e-mail or ICQ, you both spend more effort to form answers and think more when you put questions or answer them.  You have at least a minute to think what to answer - in case of negotiations on ICQ.  And much more time if the communication is e-mail.  Practice shows that the discussion of projects in this way allows you to more clearly formulate the TOR, and during a telephone conversation the client can talk a lot and for a long time, but in fact does not say anything. <br><br>  Secondly, e-mail and correspondence on ICQ is easy to keep, and in the case of telephone conversations - you will have to either take notes or memorize.  So the inevitable loss of information. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>

      Thirdly, the client can call at an absolutely inappropriate moment when you are driving a car or at a party.  Your request to call back may cause a negative reaction, and the client will no longer contact you.  If you agree to talk in inappropriate conditions, then the productivity of such a conversation is very doubtful. <br><br>  Fourthly, ‚Äútalkative‚Äù customers come across, who will eat you an hour or two hours, they will want to talk ‚Äúabout life‚Äù and you will not refuse them!  Therefore, it will be better if you communicate with them productively by e-mail and save time.  They will be able to write ‚Äúabout life‚Äù in a letter, and you already decide - it‚Äôs interesting for you to read or go directly to the business part. <br><br>  Fifth, a mobile phone is a personal means of communication, and they should not be scattered.  A mobile phone number must be received by regular customers and those customers who may need to urgently find you.  But not all people who apply for your services.  Most issues are quietly solved by ICQ, especially since many freelancers are online 10-15 hours a day without holidays and weekends. <br><br>  Every freelancer should respect and appreciate their customers so that they are satisfied with the cooperation, and your work brings them real benefits.  But it should not be forgotten about the balance of interests of the client and the employee.  And to build their relationships with customers is necessary in terms of the effective use of their time and maximizing income from work. <br><br><h2>  How to politely refuse a customer in a telephone conversation? </h2><br><br>  Say that it is better to form TZ in correspondence so that the information is not lost, and if necessary it can be addressed again.  A good client will understand your argument and will agree to work, otherwise it‚Äôs pointless to start cooperation. <br><br>  Source: <a href="http://kadrof.ru/">www.kadrof.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/37767/">https://habr.com/ru/post/37767/</a></p>
