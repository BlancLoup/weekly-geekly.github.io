The net profit of Yandex in 2009 amounted to 2.476 billion rubles, while Odnoklassniki increased the profit by 9.4 times in the same year compared to 2008. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The profit of the largest Russian Internet search engine decreased over the year by 9.3%, sales income also decreased by 7.3%, reaching 3.221 billion rubles, and profit before tax by 14.7% to 3.105 billion.  At the same time, revenues increased by 13.7% - to 9.03 billion rubles, while the cost of goods and services sold by Yandex increased by 41.4% and amounted to 4.795 billion rubles. <br><br>  Yandex is the parent company of the same name group, owning one of the largest Russian Internet portals.  More than 61% of the company is owned by investment funds, 24% by managers and employees, 10% by private investors and former employees, and 5% by option holders.  The company has not previously published data on their income, announcing only turnover.  The share of Yandex accounts for more than 60% of all search queries in RuNet and is the seventh among the largest search engines in the world, as of the end of 2009.  In May 2010, the company launched the English version of its search engine and entered the international level. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/051/239/cdb/051239cdb3694c2776c9362fec1a780d.gif" alt="image"><br>  According to SPARK, the performance of another major player in the Russian Internet market has grown significantly.  Net profit of Odnoklassniki LLC in 2009 amounted to 366.415 million rubles, compared with 39.096 million a year earlier.  The company's revenue amounted to 1.541 billion rubles, which is 2.4 times more than in 2008.

      Profit from sales and before tax also increased from 154.725 million rubles to 719.242 million and from 66.672 million rubles to 465.382 million, respectively.  The cost of goods sold and services increased by 1.72 times and amounted to 724.75 million rubles. <br><br>  Some analysts are surprised by these results.  Market expectations were more than modest, and no one expected that in the difficult 2009 Odnoklassniki could more than double the revenues.  Nevertheless, the service management has done a lot of work: advertisers were actively involved, promotions were held, and the result was not long in coming. <br><br>  Others believe that the service earned due to the introduction of many paid services, since the growth of the advertising market in 2009 as a whole was only 4%.  There was a fee for registration, posting photos, buying virtual gifts, for which they were nicknamed ‚Äúgreedy-graders‚Äù on Runet.  A decrease in the growth rate of the number of network users ensured a growth in net profit due to a decrease in the costs of infrastructure development and personnel.  In addition, the service has paid off loans and following the results of 2009, Odnoklassniki has no financial debt. <br><br>  Unfortunately, there is no one to compare the financial figures of the company.  Other players in the Russian social networking market do not publish fresh financial indicators.  Although analysts believe that the performance of Odnoklassniki competitors in 2009 also increased. <br><br>  Recall that only 40% of one of the largest social networks Runet "Odnoklassniki.ru" belongs to its founders Albert Popkov and his wife.  The main owner of the service is the holding Forticom, controlled by the Digital Sky Technology fund, Yuri Milner, Grigory Finger and Alisher Usmanov. <br><br>  Odnoklassniki LLC expects further growth due to the introduction of new services, such as games, which the service began to promote quite recently. <br><br>  According to <a href="http://www.forbesrussia.ru/news/53271-chistaya-pribyl-ooo-yandeks-v-2009-godu-snizilas-na-93">Forbes</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/99728/">https://habr.com/ru/post/99728/</a></p>
