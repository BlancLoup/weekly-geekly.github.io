  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Contextual advertising for small online stores</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In RuNet a large number of different online stores.  For someone, this is the main business with millions of turns, and for someone - another sales channel for their small family business.  We will talk about these online stores today.  Usually, they do not have a serious budget for online advertising, and in such conditions you need to think about the effectiveness of every ruble invested in the promotion and even a penny.  Properly configured contextual advertising campaign can be a good solution to the problem. <br><br>  Let's see how to do this. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Count pennies </h4><br>  Now, in the contextual advertising market in RuNet there are three main players: Yandex.Direct, Google AdWords and Begun.  Each has its pros and cons.  However, now they interest us solely in terms of prices. <br>  A visitor who came through Direct would cost 30 kopecks, through AdWords - 27, and through Begun - only 10. Obviously, in conditions of austerity and total crisis, Begun seems more attractive in terms of price, because in fact it is 3 times the difference!  You say: ‚ÄúYes, that this Begun, it shows up in the garbage sites, and in the Rambler almost no one is looking!‚Äù, And you will be wrong.  First of all, those visitors who, in search of a product, get to the garbage sites can click on your ad with a much greater probability, because they will not find what they are looking for on such a website.  And Rambler, anyway, still has some share of the search.

    <h4>  Aimed fire </h4><br><br>  <i>Everything I say here is equally applicable to Direct, and to AdWords and Runner, so even if you choose an ad network more expensive, these tips can help you.</i> <br><br><ol><li>  <b>Use "grocery" requests</b> <br>  Naturally, you should not think that for 10 kopecks for your bookstore you will be able to buy an ad for high-frequency or mid-frequency queries: ‚Äúbooks‚Äù or ‚Äúonline bookstore‚Äù.  But, see for yourself, there are a lot of advertiser-free keywords that contain the name of the book, the author‚Äôs last name, etc.  For example, according to the words ‚Äúfirst say no‚Äù or ‚ÄúJim Camp‚Äù ( <i>Book by D. Camp</i> ), you will buy an ad for sure.  For an online store selling mp3 players, it can be words containing the full (or close to full) product name, for example, ‚Äúexplay m20‚Äù or ‚Äúexplay m20 4gb‚Äù. </li><li>  <b>Use stop words</b> <br>  For a bookstore (as well as music, video, software store), users will be looking for excess traffic in search of freebies.  So, it makes sense to add in the stop words the various options ‚Äúdownload‚Äù, ‚Äúfree‚Äù, ‚Äúfree then‚Äù. <br></li><li>  <b>Use targeting</b> <br>  If your store is small and you do not ship all over Russia (or the world), and really don‚Äôt want to pay for those who don‚Äôt buy it, turn on targeting your city or region.  So, you will not have to explain to a visitor from Vladivostok that your Moscow courier will arrive no earlier than in 7 days and the delivery will cost as a small publishing house. </li><li>  <b>Monitor ad performance</b> <br>  It would seem that this is such a simple and obvious thing.  But some online stores do not have a large staff and in the confusion of increased sales may forget to do it, or do not regularly enough.  In principle, checking indicators once a week will be enough.  Use your statistics system to understand from which <i>visitors</i> come, and from which <i>buyers</i> come. </li></ol><br><br><h4>  Perspectives </h4><br>  Over time, your store will grow, the number of products will increase, and it will become more difficult to keep track of ads.  Here can come to the aid API contextual advertising system, which is in all major players.  For example, you can make a plugin to your store script, which would automatically create or delete ads when updating the range. <br><br>  Above all, do not be afraid to experiment. <br>  And, yes, I will say it again: evaluate the effectiveness of the campaign <i>constantly</i> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/52445/">https://habr.com/ru/post/52445/</a></p>
