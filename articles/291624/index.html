Anyway, today on the market there are 4 types of feedback forms, represented by several players.  We will try, as far as possible, as objectively as possible to talk about their pros and cons. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b1f/e76/364/b1fe763645a54c0faeb6006e53200ccf.jpg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  Online call </h5><br>  <a href="http://zingaya.com/">Zingaya</a> is an online call service from a site where a customer calls not from his phone, but from his computer.  Clicking opens a window where it is enough to allow access to the microphone and the call goes to the phone managers.  Zingaya has long been on the market, at one time they wrote about them on TechCrunch and a number of international major publications.  The technology has proven itself long ago and is now on the site of such major e-commerce players as <a href="http://www.enter.ru/">Enter.ru</a> and <a href="http://www.wildberries.ru/">Wildberries.ru</a> .

Does not show whether the manager is online or not, there is no reverse call report.  If the computer does not have a microphone, then make a call will not work. <br><br><h5>  Online consultant </h5><br>  <a href="http://www.jivosite.ru/">JivoSite</a> , <a href="http://livetex.ru/">LiveTex</a> , <a href="http://redhelper.ru/">RedHelper</a> , <a href="http://redhelper.ru/">WebConsult</a> , <a href="https://www.smartsupp.com/ru/">SmartSupp</a> , <a href="https://webim.ru/">Webim</a> and a number of small and large players working on the same principle (pop-up window, where communication with the client takes place through text messages), but greatly differing from each other by additional functions.  In one of the JivoSite widgets, for example, it is indicated that applications will arrive in the mail, although it is not indicated how the client will respond and when.  LiveTex communicates immediately in the window that opens, but with an anonym: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a2f/b14/819/a2fb1481941a4b1e803cc8197843a1bd.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  Like Zingaya, online consultants have been on the market for more than a year and have managed to establish themselves on the positive side.  Regarding prices, there is a certain variation depending on the company's policy, but on average a fee is paid for each individual operator.  The price for one operator per month is from 800 to 2500 rubles. <br><br>  Pros: simple setup, control obtrusiveness, complete customization of the appearance, the possibility of additional functions, including personification. <br><br>  Cons: There is a link to the computer (to communicate with the client, the manager must be at the computer), the fee for each operator (if the operators are 5-6, the price can be up to 10,000 rubles per month). <br><br><h5>  Custom callback order forms and online chat rooms on Jabber </h5><br>  They are handwritten widgets, each of which looks different, and, accordingly, works the same way.  As a rule, such widgets are bundled with the site itself and makes as a bonus / for an additional fee / having previously discussed the same studio as the site.  On this basis, the form is branded.  The most common practice is to write such widgets on Jabber.  This also includes forms based on ready-made solutions, for example, <a href="http://www.livezilla.net/home/en/">LiveZilla</a> allows you to create a chat for your site or the same <a href="http://www.chat-focus.nl/">ChatFocus</a> . <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f64/d64/5f1/f64d645f14644ab69238998101e9bae0.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  Pros: Cheap and angry.  Branding for website design, the ability to make the form as the customer wishes - a call, text, or both.  No fees to third-party companies. <br><br>  Cons: Not very reliable and do not always work, often constitute a props. <br><br><h5>  Callback widgets </h5><br>  <a href="http://rocketcallback.com/">Rocket Callback</a> , <a href="http://callbackhunter.com/">Callback Hunter</a> and many others.  Thousands of them.  They are a pop-up window with 1 field for entering a phone number.  It differs from Zingaya in that the communication takes place over the phone, not via a computer, although the same VoIP is used.  Differ among themselves with additional features - in Perezvoni this is a multividget, in the Rocket Callback it is set to obtrusiveness, in RedConnect a shared browser and so on.  At the price of a strong variation, but the lowest price for the Rocket Callback (about 6 rubles per minute), the highest for Callback Hunter (about 60 rubles per minute). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a75/970/898/a75970898de64066b61d25adc39eea0c.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  Pros: There is no binding to the computer, the price does not depend on the number of operators, setting the obtrusiveness and appearance of the widget, instant communication (from 20 seconds). <br><br>  Cons: With aggressive settings can greatly interfere with visitors, annoying their appearance at the most inopportune moment. <br><br>  Each of the 4 types of feedback is both minus and plus.  The online call is good, but you can't talk without a microphone.  Online consultants are very convenient, but that's just the high price for a few operators.  The handwritten forms allow not paying anyone, but they require constant attention.  Callback widgets allow you to instantly contact, but they can be incredibly intrusive.  It is believed that each of the varieties can replace the other, but this is unlikely, since each has its own strengths and weaknesses.  The best solution would be to test all 4 and dwell on what gave the best result. <br><br>  Thank you for reading us! <br>  Subscribe to our <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/rocketcallback/">blog</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/291624/">https://habr.com/ru/post/291624/</a></p>
