      Let's start. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Lamp - for audioflov, and a lot of problems.  Transistor - for a long time to adjust, and it is necessary to select the element base precisely, for errors in parts sold in markets and in stores sometimes reach 10% <br>  As a result, the choice fell on the chip. <br>  Googling and reading the forums chose the chip TDA2050. <br><br>  Inclusion scheme: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2b9/776/810/2b9776810484de95aa1c310e5b79c38c.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  As you can see, the body kit is minimal. <br>  They also need radiators. <br><br>  He took 500 rubles.  and moved in the direction of radio markets and shops. <br><br>  The entire element base cost a little more than 100 rubles. <br><br>  Needed the same power source.  I will not go into details of nutrition.  Diode bridge + output Conder - about another 100 rubles. <br><br>  Radiators bought on the market from the old first stump 2 pieces of 20 rubles. <br><br>  + bought more stuff, which will be lower. <br><br>  Came back home.  It is necessary to make seals.  I decided not to bother for a long time.  He took out a piece of textolite from the bins, marked out the tracks, drew them by hand with a marker, which is on the photo below. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/868/68a/db7/86868adb78fe83a545ee6b1177d85414.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Corroded with ferric chloride (again, he took from old stock). <br><br>  Signet decided not to drill, but to solder parts on top of the track. <br><br>  To the power supply a little more responsible.  Here, the textolite is still drilled, because the conders are large and if you solder them from above, the mechanical load on the copper foil is large, it can peel off.  Well, + stabilizers on + -12 volts just in case, for the future I attached on ordinary zener diodes + a transistor with a resistor. <br><br>  About the transformer later. <br><br>  All canopy connected.  Connect the sound source and speakers.  Popper self-excitement.  Beeps and that's it.  Soldered straight to the feet of the food mikruh Conder film on 100n.  The excitement is gone.  Chased an hour - it works. <br><br>  Now the case. <br>  Old Vega 10U-120 was rolling around (from it there was a transformer). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a94/01c/87e/a9401c87e098d262d6234f637048c95e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Threw everything out of it except trance. <br><br>  He cleaned off the silverfish, put a plate on the front panel.  All painted (the usual paint from a matte spray left). <br><br>  Here's what happened (did 2 years ago, so already worn): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d23/d1d/d6d/d23d1dd6d2715145f1579e610e2d4008.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The power unit stuck in place of the 2 Conders who were there: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ba7/4ec/4cf/ba74ec4cfb414edb522d95fb527045d3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The volume control is a common variable for 2 kilo. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/28c/018/d6a/28c018d6a42fe633dbd291a6cabfc3be.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Usilki fastened to 1 bolt.  They are lightweight, so they hold tight: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d7e/373/acc/d7e373accf64db6a903885e53c7696d0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Knob regulator (variable) bought for 10 rubles sometime: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/511/871/cc5/511871cc5b3999d8e247795f46e77e11.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Wires for audio: I bought 2 meters of a microphone cable at 30 rubles a meter. <br><br>  Everything began to look like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6b0/621/70c/6b062170c6cda220a73f7fdd93bdc5c5.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/199/7fc/34b/1997fc34b53a1e5d0e82d7682032b47f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the back wall of the socket for the input signal and terminal output. <br>  Twisted.  Connect the computer and speakers.  Everything worked immediately and without complaints. <br><br>  I'm not a big fan of sound.  To my ears, it plays no worse than what is sold in a store for the price of 6-10 thousand rubles.  But it definitely became better than it was when there were native giblets in this amplifier case.  Skyscrapers appeared normal, the bass more or less cut through.  It was probably bad because of the dried up old Conder in the old giblets. <br>  In general, after all this was done, there are 30 rubles left from 30 rubles. All this taking into account the driveways from shops to shops. <br><br>  After some time, I took a Magnat Monitor Sub 200 A subwoofer (then it cost me 5000 rubles).  But this is a conversation about acoustics and another topic. <br><br>  Since then, I have never complained about the sound.  Everything works without complaints.  Enough for background music and for movies and for parties to listen to the neighbors. <br><br>  ps This story was long ago, so that some in the moments could lie a little. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/83119/">https://habr.com/ru/post/83119/</a></p>
