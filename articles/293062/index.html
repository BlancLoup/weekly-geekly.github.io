Part 2</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  After the <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/gdeparking/blog/17166/">first</a> part of the article, in which we looked at the basic elements that help to start doing something new (in our case, a startup), we will discuss today the factors that are subsidiary and try to determine the area where all this needs to be applied.  Let's get started! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/726/816/758/72681675804e49beaf73c9a87ca89dcf.png"><br><br>  So, let us remember the basic elements, each of which can lead to an ‚Äúaction‚Äù and which were described in the first article: <br><ol><li>  Internal need; </li><li>  Wednesday (environment); </li><li>  External circumstances; </li></ol><br>  Basic elements literally <u>force</u> us to do something.  And speaking of "catalysts", one can say that their role, on the contrary, is to facilitate this occupation.  What can be attributed to them? <a name="habracut"></a>

Having an idea</b> <br><br>  I felt from my own experience that having an idea that you like, and about the implementation of which you constantly think, is able to fundamentally influence how you perceive information.  A simple example, before the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãWhereParking, the articles on entrepreneurship, came to me as nothing more than entertainment content.  I had no relation to entrepreneurship and didn‚Äôt project them much on myself.  Just bookmarked with the thought "I will soon use this information," and of course this did not happen. <br><br>  But as soon as an idea captures all your thoughts, and you try to figure out how to implement it most effectively, everything starts to go: ‚ÄúFeatures of the distribution of content on instagram?‚Äù - ok, we are trying to cross-posting.  ‚ÄúIf a user leads other paying users, then you should not give him discounts, let him use the content for free while the others pay‚Äù - ok, let's apply on your product.  In general, any information that has not previously accumulated in the memory begins to be carefully analyzed and applied. <br>  But it should be understood that the vague desire to ‚Äúwant to do business‚Äù is not what I'm talking about.  Look for a specific idea, a specific niche that will become more and more clear in your head, thereby helping to act. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bf9/bd4/5cc/bf9bd45cc48f4f96b6c305f474b89099.jpg"></div><br>  <b>2. Ability to realize now (skills / money / communication / etc)</b> <br><br>  The opportunity to start realizing your idea right here and now is wonderful.  It is a drive, it is breathtaking, it is cool.  But such a scenario is the most ideal and comfortable scenario (after all, this is wonderful when you are an expert in this field, and there are no problems with finances either). <br><br>  A good example of such a scenario is the well-known (but real) story about Ferruccio Lamborghini, who, due to dissatisfaction with the quality of his Ferrari, decided to make his own sports car, with bulls and hinges.  After all, he had his own production of tractors, there were finances.  And precisely because of the opportunity to immediately begin to implement the plan, it helped to make it conceived before such feelings as resentment and irritation were not replaced by indifference. <br><br>  But at the same time, one should not consider such an ‚Äúideal‚Äù scenario as the ‚Äúonly true‚Äù way.  That is why the ability to realize the idea now is only a catalyst.  Because if you can do at least something for the project (find content, write a piece of code, organize people), this is enough to get things going.  You will be surprised how in the course of work those questions and problems that you were so afraid of at the idea stage will be solved.  Just keep doing the project and things will be done. <br><br>  When describing a ‚Äúnon-ideal‚Äù scenario, you should clearly understand that it may require serious decisions from you.  When a person says that he "does not have enough funding" for implementation, this is not quite the case.  There are almost always opportunities, they are simply not as perfect as we would like.  After all, you can take a loan or sell a car.  Yes, it is very risky, unpleasant, and can even be dangerous.  But sometimes this is what separates entrepreneurs from other people. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/467/2a3/593/4672a359398a4b05a23b7d96298d1d2b.png" width="650" height="320"></div><br>  But do not think that everything is so critical.  We, for example, have generally <a href="https://boomstarter.ru/projects/392431/gdeparking">launched</a> Whereparking on the crowdfunding platform in order to attract funding.  Unusual experience, new conditions, some of its own ‚Äúrules of the game‚Äù: for example, I am not a particularly public person, but here I had to record a personal appeal and start an Instagram. <br><br>  Why do I say this: yes, the ideal ‚Äúability to realize now‚Äù allows you to make a project like a steam locomotive: straight and steady.  But this does not mean that the limited capabilities at the start are something critical.  No, just the path will be a little longer, non-linear and it will take more effort.  And this is usually accompanied by new experiences and skills and connections, i.e.  what was lacking at the very beginning. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/805/3fc/23d/8053fc23d44a447bb94c5a5b913346b4.jpg" alt="image" width="580" height="280"></div><br>  <b>3. Time</b> <br><br>  Time can be seen in two ways.  Firstly, it relates to the project itself, or rather, how long it will take to implement it: if a month or two, then an insurmountable desire arises "forward and with a song", but the year when it is necessary to be in stealth mode for a year is something the sensations are completely different.  Secondly, it is related to you yourself - will you have the physical ability to give the project enough attention not only to track current changes within the team, but also to keep your nose to the wind? <br><br>  How to apply to yourself: The term of the project, you know, depends on many reasons.  If we are talking about our own time, then, as usual, it is always not enough.  So you need to sacrifice something.  But in the era of the Internet, if you try at least some of the time not to spend in social.  networks, it has the property of unexpected release :) <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/969/88e/5cc/96988e5cc10a4cea8a01bb9cdcb00271.jpg" width="600" height="450" alt="image"></div><br>  <b>Application area</b> <br><br>  We dismantled the basic elements and studied the catalysts.  But what to do with all this, where do all these factors go? <br><br>  To understand where to go, you need to understand where you are right now.  The state when you are sitting in the office and, despite the desire to start something new, you don‚Äôt really change anything, is called a ‚Äúcomfort zone‚Äù.  Salary is not the maximum, but normal.  The office is not the best, but quite bearable. <br><br>  Therefore, all the above elements should be directed to being in the current state, you are not comfortable, i.e.  so that all these factors become so strong as to literally knock you out of your comfort zone.  To make you feel more relaxed when doing a new business, and not sitting on the couch.  And it is precisely to this that the efforts of all previous factors should be directed.  After all, there is nothing more offensive than regretting that you have not done in life something that you have been thinking about so much for so long. <br><br>  Thanks for attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293062/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293062/</a></p>
