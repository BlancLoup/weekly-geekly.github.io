With the Eisenhower method, you will learn to separate concepts such as "important" and "urgent."  Any work divided into urgent and important tasks, and only then proceed to perform.  We often focus on ‚Äúimportant and urgent‚Äù matters, those that need to be done immediately.  Ask yourself: ‚ÄúWhen will I do important, but not urgent things?  When will I take on important tasks before they become urgent? ‚ÄùThis is an area for strategic, long-term solutions. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">How to be happy?</font> </h2><br>  Try a ‚Äústreaming‚Äù model. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fdc/bb5/5a6/fdcbb55a668e41f4a2f18331b7c50ed9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  More than 1,000 respondents took part in a survey conducted by iksentmhiyi.  He was interested in what brings people a <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/dva-slova-kotorye-privedut-vas-k-uspekhu-i-schastyu/">feeling of happiness</a> .  Summing up, he noted that in all the answers there were 5 similar points.  Happiness, or "state of flow," appears when we: <br><br><ul><li>  maximally focused on activities </li><li>  chosen by us which </li><li>  is neither too simple (boring) nor too complicated, and which has </li><li>  clear goal and which gives </li><li>  immediate feedback. </li></ul><br>  Cikszentmihaji discovered that people who are ‚Äúin the flow‚Äù not only have a deep sense of satisfaction, but also lose track of time, completely forgetting about themselves, because they are completely absorbed in their occupation.  Musicians, actors, athletes, artists and doctors say that they are <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/lyubite-to-chto-delaete-4-veshchi-kotorye-sdelayut-vas-schastlivee-na-rabote/">happiest</a> when they are completely absorbed in business (often - really exhausting).  This is fundamentally contrary to the widespread view that happiness, supposedly, is associated with relaxation. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">How to remember all that you have learned?</font> </h2><br>  Use the Supermemo model. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b90/0f6/edd/b900f6edd15d444295e30fb0b5ea1425.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Let's say you learn Chinese.  You've learned a new word and remembered it.  Without practice, after a while, it will be harder to remember.  You can even calculate how long you will forget it completely, and ideally you should be reminded of it just when the word is about to be erased from memory.  The more often you will be reminded of a word, the more likely you are to remember it for a long time. <br><br>  This training program is called SuperMemo, it was developed by the Polish researcher Peter Wozniak.  Having learned something, you need to remind yourself about it at the following time intervals: after 1 day, after 10 days, after a month and two months. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">How to deal with the dilemma?</font> </h2><br>  Use the "Rubber Band Model". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f39/f19/fc7/f39f19fc7750445eb0124ff2b18922ed.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Are you familiar with this situation?  A friend, colleague or client needs to make a decision that can permanently change his life: for example, a career change, moving to another city or early retirement.  Arguments "for" and "against" - an equal number.  How can you help a person with his dilemma? <br><br>  Ask him to answer such questions: <br><br><ul><li>  ‚ÄúWhat keeps me from this decision?‚Äù </li><li>  ‚ÄúWhat drives me to this decision?‚Äù </li></ul><br>  At first glance, the method seems to be a simple variation of the usual question of what the pros and cons here are.  The difference in the following: ‚ÄúWhat keeps me?‚Äù And ‚ÄúWhat pushes me?‚Äù - positive questions, considering the situation from two alternative and attractive sides. <br><br>  PS We recommend another article that will help you make effective decisions - <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/5-glavnykh-oshibok-ili-pochemu-vashi-ratsionalnye-resheniya-ne-rabotayut/">"5 major mistakes or why your rational decisions do not work?".</a> <br><br>  Translated by Vyacheslav Davidenko, founder of <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/">MBA Consult</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292850/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292850/</a></p>
