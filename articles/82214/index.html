  <section class="page js-page"><h1>I resent. Post of Russia</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Russian Post continues to amaze me with its bureaucratic manners.  Our organization (after letters began to come to us through one, and notices of registered correspondence were often not even three of them), decided to rent a mailbox at the post office.  It was six months ago.  All the boxes were busy. <br>  By luck, the mother of our employee turned out to be a friend of the department director.  And I immediately found a free box (I wonder if someone was taken away or how did a free one suddenly appear?).  But it is not about that now. <br>  Half a year has passed, the term of the contract for the lease of the box has expired.  If you work in an organization and deal with contracts, then you know for how long long-term contracts for minor services are usually concluded - until December 31, with automatic renewal. <br><br>  Russia Post has its own way. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The contract is valid only for 6 months.  And then you have to conclude a new one.  This means that you need to come to the post office, where they will be given copies to fill out (especially progressive departments post the form on the website).  It does not matter that the mail has all your data; you will still be given forms, which you must fill out manually.  As many as 3 copies (by the way, I was forgotten and given only two of three of them). <br>  Do not think that the contract is all.  You should write an official letter with the text ‚ÄúPlease extend the subscription box lease agreement ...‚Äù.  And why is it?  When really we do not prolong, and we conclude an agreement? <br>  The second letter is a request for redirection from such an address to a / i.  We also wrote it six months ago.  Further power of attorney for each employee who will come to pick up mail. <br>  When all papers are ready, you should go to the post office and pay for the rent.  Cash (and this, I recall, a service for commercial organizations).  Further, the payment receipt, the contract, powers of attorney and letters to deliver to the delivery department, where there will be a happy end to the adventures. <br>  Six months later, repeat.  How much time it takes such paper cutting.  We have a small company, the same operations in enterprises with larger numbers will take even more time.  All powers of attorney, the contract and the letter must be signed by the director (and before that, they will probably pass a circle of smaller managers), receive money for payment from the accounting department ... <br><br>  The funny thing is that renting a box for 6 months costs <b>271.94 rubles</b> !!!  That is, the mail does not exactly earn on this service.  Why one of the most sought-after services, which is provided mainly to commercial organizations, costs a penny, but a lot of inconvenience is delivered to receive it.  Why it is impossible to increase the cost of services by 5-7 times and not to renegotiate the contract every six months to me is completely incomprehensible.  About that, to increase the level of service at least 2 times, and I do not speak already. </div>
