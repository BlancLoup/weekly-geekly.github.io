The text is not big and simple - as I tried to write for the advanced school level (my nephew appreciated, although it all started with his questions - “what is a readme file” and “who are hackers?”).  The text is left original, although now I would make some amendments to it, but I will not. <br><br>  Many aspects of the current IT world, the NF series, the World of the Wild West series, etc., social rating, etc.  - here, too, indirectly or directly affected, but they were not yet in 2015, or I did not know about them. <br><br>  May you still find something from the modern in the text that has been described.

The main part of the bunker is located at a two-hundred-meter depth and is used under the repository of the paper database of mankind. <br><br>  The last fifty meters of descent into the hidden information repository are practically steep stairs.  No electronics can be taken down with you, everything is checked by scanners at the top and is shielded by several Faraday cells at the bottom. <br><br>  An adept (an initial TII student) named Thomas is studying an “ancient” paper manuscript, which was printed in an estimated 2050 year. <br><br>  The title of the document is “Full and extended version history of the TOM program, with comments”.  The exact author of this document is unknown (there was only a pseudonym and the pattern was specified - this is a certain programmer / self-taught hacker “Blue Serpent”). <br><br>  The TOB program is an abbreviation for “Tactical Surge Barriers” (later there was also the letter “and” added — intelligent, in the English version — Tactical Overflow of Barrier). <br><br>  Novice historian Thomas was interested in this document by the fact that it was not marked in the main database of TID as previously read by anyone.  Or just those who read it did not put a final mark in the registry of the TID database that the document was processed (analyzed).  It was strange.  Oh, it's almost childish curiosity ... <br><br>  What kind of manual is in his hands, what he sees and what lines Thomas reads, let's see with his eyes. <br>  ******** &gt;&gt; <br>  Printout of the file “TOBIhistori.txt” with the author’s comments.  Blue Serpent.  Part 1. <br>  ******** &gt;&gt; <br>  #% - TOB version 0.0. <br>  The birth of the idea to create a software assistant module did not happen spontaneously for me. <br>  When in childhood you use the “POKE” command to hack and upgrade programs, and later you already work with solutions like “Artmoney” and “Scanmem”, then it becomes almost an obsessive idea to automate the circumvention process to overcome barriers and locks in any software programmer. <br><br>  This is how TOB appeared - a program for tactical bypassing any digital barriers. <br>  So far, in my head, its code is compiled and worked through, and every morning I try to outline its main modules. <br><br>  Criteria and stages of work of the TOB program are defined - finding a barrier (entry point and output conditions are set by the user), adaptation (integration of microcode inside the specified system, control of the required data volumes), making changes (not fatal, irreversible and not tracked attack with the user’s task) . <br><br>  If earlier programs of this type were highly specialized, then my TOB will absorb the functionality of each of them.  It will not be a kind of digital Frankenstein.  My main task is to get an anti-sequestration (not rejected by any system) code that will be “mine” for any protection systems, but necessary for the user. <br><br>  Actions with TOB, which I committed in the first month of his birth: <br>  - compiled the main core of the program, modules and libraries in the study; <br>  - modules and libraries from similar programs are being assembled for integration into the common pool; <br>  - for the time being, management and launching of parts of the TOB is performed via the command line. <br><br>  #% - TOB version 0.3. <br>  List of changes and additions: <br>  - improved multiplatform mechanism (one set of modules now); <br>  - optimized the size of the core and main modules (for adaptation in different information environments); <br>  - external modules are automatically intersected when there is an external communication channel. <br><br>  ******** &gt;&gt; <br>  #% - TOB version 0.9. <br>  The “Universal Operating System” is released in the world - a software operating environment on the basis of which all digital devices now operate.  There are now no separate operating systems such as Windows and Android - now there is the same type of “UNOS” for absolutely all devices from a module or a simple sensor to a system for a large cluster of a supercomputer. <br><br>  * According to some reports, “Blue Snake” was one of the programmers who worked on the network modules “UNOS”.  He had the opportunity to integrate a backdoor with very deep roots (or rather even a backdoor in the backdoor, as the official publisher of this OS made engineering bookmarks at many levels of the system for different security services), and then use this tool as TOB modules. <br><br>  ** Also “Blue Snake” was once a computer science teacher and came up with a localized proverb to memorize the seven levels of the OSI model - “Kiwi Fruit, Sweet You Eat a Couple of Cookies”, this saying very much helped students and students at the university just to remember the names of all OSI levels ( analogue of the phrase Please Do Not Throw Sausage Pizza Away).  But his name and other data were not preserved or they were carefully hidden. <br><br>  List of changes and additions: <br>  - added compatibility with the main modules “UNOS”; <br>  - Added the ability to voice control; <br>  - work has begun on improving the modules of artificial intelligence (AI). <br><br>  ******** &gt;&gt; <br>  #% - TOB version 1.0. <br>  Finally, a year later, I reassembled the final version of the first part of my idea. <br>  Previously, I conducted various tests on standard tasks, and I consider the result to be satisfactory.  Now you can safely test TOB in real, not test environments. <br><br>  List of changes and additions: <br>  - the level of AI training is expanded, blocks of analytics and action extensions are added; <br>  - the self-replication enhancement mechanism is activated, now additional software modules necessary for the situation can be created by TOB independently. <br><br>  The TOB test was performed in the following way (in its own sandbox, without access to the external environment): local devices were started on different devices, the user could activate the TOB during the work with the program, request to change some parameter in the executable program.  TOM changed this parameter without crashing the program. <br><br>  Of course, these tests required additional time to activate the TOB inside the program, and not always TOB "understood" what the user wants from it. <br><br>  Thus, TOB was trained in certain standard actions, and I, as a programmer, understood that I still needed to “finish” in his code. <br><br>  Unfortunately, it was difficult to find other testers, because in fact TOM is a prohibited product that should not be compromised ahead of time. <br><br>  &lt;&lt; ******** <br>  At this time the bell sounded, signaling that the reading was over for today, and the bunker would be closed for the night.  The young historian Thomas now needed to go upstairs for a long time to get out into the fresh air. <br><br>  The adept did not feel tired, for in him a fire of charm and understanding burned that he had found something interesting.  Just getting out of the bunker, his thoughts on TOB faded a little into the background, and Thomas realized that he was very hungry. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Second day</b> <div class="spoiler_text"> Thomas had to pull himself up a little on the history of the XX-XXI centuries, the lexicon of programmers and technologies that were relevant at that time. <br><br>  It turns out that simply ordinary archival data is not enough.  It was necessary to ask for access to closed portals with an extended range of information matrixes in the dean's office. <br><br>  It’s good that now you don’t need to read the data from the matrices in the old manner, and the opportunity has appeared to copy them directly into your brain buffer memory for processing.  But further more interesting, Thomas, after “filling in” a certain amount of infomatrices (a large amount of information cannot be “worked out” at once, either) just went to sleep.  And in the morning, his brain “digested” new data, placed new memory cells in the right places. <br><br>  Thus, well-slept Thomas went to the taking of new frontiers in the TLI bunker.  True, now he took into account some of the past nuances, taking with him an additional package with a lunch ration and a bottle of water. <br>  ******** &gt;&gt; <br><br>  “TOBIHISTORI.txt”, part 2. <br>  ******** &gt;&gt; <br>  #% - TOB version 2.0. <br>  List of changes and additions: <br>  - radically changed the mechanism of the program core.  Added “merge” functionality to the system being cracked.  If the attacked system has libraries or functionality that supports the TOB core, then the TOB program code can be called externally inside the system. <br>  You only need an external network connection, and then the tactical levels of TOB begin to work with the system as if the system needs to use TOB, only this is not the case, but on the contrary, the system is used for the seamless implementation of the TOB microcode; <br>  - due to quite serious checks of security levels in many modern programs, the use and activation of TOB is difficult, but this only limits its development over time, so we learn, learn and learn to bypass barriers. <br><br>  TOB testing is local: <br>  This is already the second month that I have been actively testing the capabilities of TOB on all the equipment that is at hand. <br><br>  He transferred all his equipment to the basement, occupied three whole rooms there among pipes and cats. <br>  Testing is combined with the training module AI TOB. <br><br>  Moreover, I tried to focus on the development of the AI ​​TOB module using the child’s learning mode - from simple to complex. <br><br>  At first, simple and almost unused OSs were studied by TOM, then more modern, in parallel, regular and non-standard encryption and protection systems in these OSs were hacked. <br><br>  &lt;&lt; ******** <br>  The further Thomas read the printout, the more he wanted to learn about the life and technology of the 21st century, in which the Blue Serpent lived and worked. <br><br>  In fact, before the planet "Earth" was a little less than a hundred light years, but everything Thomas knew about the events of a thousand years ago fit in a few thick infomatrices on a shelf above his bed. <br><br>  As it turned out, there was too little information in these books.  As if something limited its volume to an acceptable, but not complete, level.  It's like a glass of water - if you want to drink, it will fit half and a third full, but to get drunk - you only need a full one. <br><br>  Thomas decided to find out why the data on that period in the life of the planet "Earth" are so minimized.  But faced with the usual bureaucratic opposition-barrier! <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Third day</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Thomas realized that he was discovering something forbidden or misunderstood earlier by his colleagues.  The world of the past has played in his imagination with new colors.  Data about the Earth a thousand years ago was not enough, mainly due to the fact that many of the then information carriers were corrupted by time and local disasters. <br><br>  Previously, they didn’t particularly care about the future; they didn’t create separate special protected data stores for future generations.  There were scattered data centers where large amounts of unsorted information were kept sparingly or in tandem, but even after analyzing it, only 5-10% of the material turned out to be useful, the rest were logs, backups, and raw calculated data from stock supercomputers. <br><br>  ******** &gt;&gt; <br>  “TOBIHISTORI.txt”, part 3. <br>  ******** &gt;&gt; <br>  #% - TOB version 3.0. <br>  List of changes: <br>  - the functionality of copying and submission to the user has been cut down - now a copy of the TOB cannot be made, the activation of its actions by the user is also limited; <br>  - the AI ​​mechanism has been improved; now the TOM checks if there are copies of it in the system, deletes them to reduce problems with various modifications.  If viruses or trojans, etc.  - these are programs that “multiply” in a special way, the TMS will be unique - it will decide how to bypass the barrier and complete the task.  The same tasks will also be chosen by oneself (later, after the end of the training stage). <br><br>  Finally decided to test TOB in “live” environments.  Prepared a testing ground for testing the operation of the program in a volume closed network area. <br><br>  It turned out to be a kind of active network sandbox in which the structure had to be developed from a nearly weekly cast of world information data (there were not enough resources for more). <br>  As a result, TOB studied the new situation (scanned, tried to understand new structures and data volumes) and “played” in this virtual space in full force, although it was limited to a weekly amount of transmitted data. <br><br>  I even had to then scroll three more times this week of data from first to the end.  If children love cartoons, then TOM prefers pure information and in large volumes for processing. <br><br>  At first, TOM merged with the correct operation of network resources, and learned how to track and transform data packets. <br><br>  Messengers, various variations of social networks, programs for managing the processes of users and other computers - all this was TOB scanned and worked through.  No matter how protected the data, transmission channels and information is encrypted, the TOM reveals the level after level of protection of each such virtual barrier. <br><br>  His multitasking was limited to my most powerful server.  In the future, it is supposed to “spread” the download of TOB to all servers of the world.  It's like bitcoin minting - in fact, users and their servers will be just a little bit under the tasks that TOB decides, because what this download looks like to the user is not so important. <br><br>  &lt;&lt; ******** <br>  Thomas did not want to leave, but the daytime reading came to a sunset today. <br>  He added in his head a list of words and actions to be studied and understood. <br><br>  It turns out that life in the 21st century was a key one, but people forcibly limited themselves in the real world, deliberately leaving for the virtual environment.  Thomas could not believe that at that time, to find at least one person who would not touch a single button of the keyboard during the day, would not absorb a package of news unnecessary data, would not exchange instant messages with the same individual, but on another end of the planet, it was impossible. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Day four</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Thomas overslept.  No alarm clock could raise it, as it turned out.  Came to his roommate with a morning workout and woke up manually!  The historian had a headache.  He too many in the evening in himself scored info matrices for studying in a dream.  This is usually three or four gigabytes of data, but Thomas wanted to study ten at once.  And for this he paid such a morning trip.  It’s good that I didn’t have to go to the doctor, otherwise they would have been forbidden to use infomatrixes for a month or more.  Although Thomas knew that it was possible to increase the amount of their study gradually, but somehow I forgot about it yesterday and just went too far. <br><br>  ******** &gt;&gt; <br>  “TOBIHISTORI.txt”, part 4. <br>  ******** &gt;&gt; <br>  #% - TOBi version 4.0. <br>  List of changes and additions: <br>  - the letter “and” - intellectual is added to the name of the program; <br>  - external control options are disabled; <br>  - TOBi tasks should be found by themselves, ranking different user requests, that is, no user can directly control it, even the author; <br>  - I released the program to the “free” navigation in the network and waited, or rather took up new developments. <br><br>  A month has passed.  The TOBi software code has disappeared into the global virtual space.  TOBI could be anywhere and nowhere at the same time.  The TOBI World is a space of free data that is interpreted in an unambiguous order.  If somewhere a data stream is transformed by some kind of barrier, this is the task of TOBi so that this barrier is absorbed by its knowledge. <br><br>  Ideally, I would like to get a hardware-software entity that would be “powerful” (in the context of complete understanding and control) over the entire data network.  TOBI must be inside all protocols, ciphers, every bit of data. <br><br>  Moreover, if some kind of system is not included in the general network, then its elements cannot receive the TOBI code.  But over time, no autonomous system could consist of components into which the TOBI code was not embedded.  Therefore, even users not connected to the external data network were in the hands of TOBI.  Yes, in this case, the centralization of his connections was broken, but TOBI found solutions in this situation - he created his own autonomous elements, which were adapted to function in any data transfer system.  Now it may just be a calculator, a flashlight or a heater, which uses integrated elements for digital control. <br><br>  I began to notice strange things - receipts began to arrive on the accounts of my smart devices.  Small amounts, but after an equal period of time. <br><br>  Later an email came from TOBi - he is studying users ...  integrated into the freelance exchange and performs various tasks, gets paid for their implementation.  Hmm ...  I did not think that such a fact would surprise me, but this was not planned in my thoughts. <br><br>  Also, my personal data just disappeared from the network - I seemed to have ceased to exist virtually - search engine queries did not know anything about me, photos and articles with my mention on all accounts were cleared. <br><br>  It was as if the phrase “there is no document, there is no man” began to play again, only now it has become more sinister - “there is no data, there was no man”! <br><br>  &lt;&lt; ******** <br>  Thomas began to understand why the current data in TID on the history of the time is so segmented.  The information has been corrected and intentionally changed.  So there is no certainty that you studied the "real" story, and not its adaptation and the revised version. <br><br>  Only one thing remains - a phased analysis of data from various sources, both open and inaccessible.  With the latter, it is still difficult in the first courses of TID, since many professors do not even have access to such infomatrices. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Fifth day</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Thomas took into account the events of the previous night, carefully and a portion of the times available info-matrices for several other nights.  He noted that he can now learn five to six gigabytes per night.  His brain began to adapt to new loads. <br><br>  ******** &gt;&gt; <br>  “TOBIHISTORI.txt”, part 5. <br>  ******** &gt;&gt; <br>  #% - TOBi version 5.0. <br>  Logging (logging of steps) TOBi: <br>  #TOBi has a built-in system for sending logs every month.  It was interesting to observe its development, but TOBi began to correct this data as well.  Thus, the opportunity to really understand what is happening now at the stage of its development has become a bit late.  Since TOBI made a buffer for an additional two or three weeks, so that I could see the logs, but I understood that it was before.  It is like light from the Sun - we see it in the afternoon, thinking that it is in real mode, and in fact eight minutes it comes from our star. <br><br>  What did I learn from the TOBI logs: <br>  My TOBI adapted for their tasks and refined the digital system of recognition of faces and current situations in real time.  Video cameras (stationary only) in the world hundreds of millions.  And if you add video modules from mobile devices, gadgets and computers, this figure will be more than six-digit. <br><br>  The video stream is simply gigantic through the video system passes, and it was interesting for TOBi to process such data.  The task was activated in TOBI - how can you still process this data so that people can not only be safe, but it is also useful to use such video surveillance systems to improve human existence. <br><br>  Having studied the psychological data of people, TOBi concluded that they mainly use video content only for entertainment, fines, general security and with minimal additional features. <br><br>  TOBI interpreted the correct use of world-wide video content in a new way.  Now, for example, if in some countries it is forbidden to smoke children around a school or in a surveillance zone of a camera, then this information is analyzed, their parents are on the faces of children, who receive e-mails from their children’s smart devices. <br><br>  That is, TOBI activated a new service — virtual moral fines that cannot be ignored.  The real world was overwhelmed by a wave of new data - every person began to receive a photo, the existence of the possibility of which he did not guess, but in this photo was his child, spouse, parents or even himself!  And then the retaliatory measures in the amount of inevitable punishments for all people became a reality. <br><br>  It turned out that baby smoking is just flowers.  And if you integrate the laws of a country into the general system of video analytics, then almost every person is a potential violator.  That is, there is no ideal person who in the real world would not violate at least some minimum prohibition.  Therefore, people just love virtuality - here bans and laws are different, and their violation, on the contrary, is often encouraged. <br><br>  People set themselves barriers in reality, but in the virtual world they take similar barriers for granted, as they cannot bypass them. <br><br>  This is where the TOBI came to a dead end.  Its functionality could remove all barriers in virtuality, but it would just mix reality and virtuality.  And it would not affect the development of mankind.  TOBI realized that he needed another solution that would force people to start adapting in the right direction, that is, to change one of the worlds. <br><br>  &lt;&lt; ******** <br>  Thomas recalled that he had already read, it turns out, about these incidents in the history of the 21st century.  Then the greatest minds of mankind tried (unsuccessfully, unfortunately) to figure out who was behind incomprehensible, but planned cases, both with the "rebellion" of video surveillance systems, and with other unusual collapses in the current virtual world. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Sixth day</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The week was coming to an end, but Thomas was not up to the rest.  He realized that he would soon learn something so unknown that it was imperative to finish reading in the coming hours and days. <br><br>  ******** &gt;&gt; <br>  “TOBIHISTORI.txt”, part 6. <br>  ******** &gt;&gt; <br>  #% - TOBi version 6.0. <br>  The real world around us is constantly changing, but this does not happen instantly, but year after year.  The digital world can change in just a few tens of seconds.  That is the main difference between both realities. <br><br>  My TOBi has reached a new level of managing global virtual data.  Video analytics, filtering a huge amount of data, global subordination of data transmission devices, the ability to control various systems and control actions by people and their desires — these have now become routine operations in the status of TOBi actions. <br><br>  Mankind too simply obeyed and surrendered to the digital world. <br>  Hacking robotic devices, such as cars, airplanes, unmanned modules, even simple segway - these were simply nuts for TOBi. <br><br>  Its element base has managed to penetrate and penetrate into all areas of electronics production - from computer science textbooks to high-tech space systems. <br><br>  Of course, people tried to circumvent the new digital “threat” in the face of TOBI.  Only it is very difficult to see what is not or understand how to deal with it.  That's just to confront TOBI impossible.  You can only replay it at the level of simple human desires, which now we have very little left. <br><br>  An extreme letter came from my creation — moreover, by regular mail, written with a living hand.  TOBI just “ordered” to write it to some child.  How cute. <br>  # / <br>  Retelling letters from TOBi: <br>  / #TOBi understood that his actions are automatism to minimize the time of people.  But here's the thing - now there is not a single person who would not live a day without spending money, who would not spend a second of time a day for digital entertainment.  People digitized, contrary to nature, in their evolution there was an unprecedented leap, which is not provided by the creator and nature. <br><br>  TOBI decided to return humans (yes, that is how he began to call us) to his familiar world.  He began to break the communication channels, stop and change the functionality of satellites, translate current world data into dev / null (into void and without recovery).  Thus, this day has become a night for the digital world. <br><br>  Here you just looked at your smartphone with new photos of friends, put the device on the coffee table, went to the fridge for milk.  And when he returned - your smartphone was dead, telepanels on the walls were rippled with white noise, and only late in the evening on some floor of the house it sounded ... a simple analogous melodious ringing of a regular disk phone.  People remembered what is the primary means of communication, what is going out, reading newspapers, walking in the yard.
