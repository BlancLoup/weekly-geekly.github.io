  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Internet of the future</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Yesterday, when I went to bed, I had a thought that caused half the night tossing and turning.  And today, all day thinking about it.  Because it is not possible to realize this in life itself, but maybe the very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa night nonsense, I want to share the idea with the Habra public. <br><br>  So, the next thought.  What will be the internet of the future?  What is this internet?  In connection with the development of a large number of Internet services in a multi-directional format: from instant messengers and social networks (such as contact and classmates), continuing with more serious communities - habr, lj, as well as a large number of smaller sites where we spend most of the time, I would like to note, in this short list of services - google docs (seemingly correctly called?), which replaces the usual Office (well, or Open Office), as well as a large number of different sites for time planning, expenses planning, various widgets  Comrade, again, Twitter, of course, classical (ie, e-mail) mail, search services, and so on - the list goes on and on. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Considering that I called only a part (albeit essential), but far from all the services that we use every day.  Also new services will appear every day.  Not for nothing on Habr√© there is a monthly announcement of the best startup projects.  And what does all this lead to?  And what global problems create? <br><br>  The global problem is that the volume is already huge.  And to control all this volume, even at the level of user control, is very difficult.  It will be even more difficult.  And what is the way out?  It was over this that I suffered half the night and today all day in my mind. 
      <br>

      And the next output.  The Internet of the future is a generator of user interests.  Perhaps this is exactly what web 3.0 is.  Generator, blogging to which, we can enter our data from all of our favorite services, and all this will be convenient and functional work.  Those.  this is a kind of portal that I create for myself, on this portal all my friends and acquaintances, all my favorite sites, everything is done in such a way that I only need to log in once, register once on the same platform, and I can add all your desired sites. <br><br>  Apparently this will be an aggregator that will actively work with open id, with social bookmarking services, with integrated popular messengers, or offer his own, with integrated search, which I like, or maybe a mixture of my favorite search engines that show search results in my portal, in my design, for example, by the first 3 results of 3 search engines, and if sites match in search engines, then this site is ranked higher.  Also this portal will actively work rss-translator.  Also in this portal I will be able to install various toolbars or their equivalent from each small site, from my favorite site, small and so homely.  And each site developer will be extremely easy to make almost any informant on his site for this portal. <br><br>  What it will be - the portal, i.e.  Internet site and new service - or it will be some kind of browser - one of the current ones, or every browser will become such, or maybe it will be some kind of special new program, or it will be a ‚Äúlive desktop‚Äù and manufacturers of operating rooms systems will be connected, or, alternatively, it will be a whole operating system ‚Äúopen-internet‚Äù - this is a question.  Generally it does not matter. <br><br>  In general, this is the idea that I visited and tormented all day :) Do you think - is the future of the Internet?  Or something else? <br><br>  I propose to discuss this my idea, to express all the pros and cons of it, and maybe to offer my ideas - what will be the Internet of the future? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/60537/">https://habr.com/ru/post/60537/</a></p>
