Since this topic is very close to me, I decided to share my thoughts. <br><br>  <i>He who wants is looking for opportunities, who does not want is looking for reasons.</i>  This thesis is applicable to many issues - lack of material and technical base at the university, stupid teachers, passivity of companies, etc.  These are, of course, important reasons why young people do not want to learn, but let's see. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Lack of material and technical base </h4><br>  Often I hear - in high school A there is a computing cluster, in B there is an innovation center, and we have only a few coffins running Windows 3.11.  I myself observe this in my own university.

      Often the young specialist justifies himself in such a way ‚Äúthey say, I am not guilty, there was no base - therefore I don‚Äôt know anything‚Äù  Following this logic, no graduate of the spherical Muhosran Technical University can, <i>by definition,</i> be smarter than a student at top universities.  In the same way, a Harvard graduate must be smarter than all graduates from all the universities in the world. <br><br>  But real life shows that a graduate of the spherical Muhosran Technical University and a graduate of a top university in the country may end up sitting next to him in some kind of Microsoft Research, Google or Oracle.  And all because different people <i>accepted the difficulties in their lives in different ways</i> .  Someone found in this the reason for their inaction, and someone - a call to action. <br><br><h4>  Stupid teachers </h4><br>  Here you can argue for a long time and the truth will be somewhere in the middle.  But according to the laws of normal distribution, there are always those 20% of intelligent teachers who can and should be dealt with.  But very often the student consciously chooses frankly weak teachers in order to quickly and cheekily do their work.  Or, knowing that the teacher is intelligent, but demanding, consciously choose the weaker and less demanding, so that there are fewer problems. <br><br>  And now a little personal.  I had a physics teacher - not that a bad physicist, but a bad teacher - that's for sure.  Bad because he had all these students, the lectures for the 40th year of teaching were for one person.  As a result, the toilet roll was more informative than the physics outline.  A volitional decision was made not to go in pairs in order <i>not to waste their precious time</i> .  But the session came and it was necessary to pass the subject.  What do you think 90% of students did?  They guessed it ‚Äî they made some money on the development of the department of physics and the material condition of the teachers of the department of physics.  As a result, no knowledge, no money ... <s>In 2.5 days I learned a book on physics and independently passed the exam.</s> <br><br>  As a young teacher, I can say that when you voluntarily tell and show C # instead of Pascal, MS SQL and MySQL instead of FoxPro, and when you end up taking three minutes from a trance after asking ‚Äúwhat is a query‚Äù, then continue to talk about data mining, I don‚Äôt feel like factor analysis and MVC ... <br><br><h4>  Passivity of companies </h4><br>  Everything is simple here - companies believe that universities should give them trained students, universities think that they should only give materiel.  As a result, we have a situation where the graduate remotely understands what the OOP is, and at the same time is lost in the phrase "Runge-Kutta method." <br><br>  Why all?  Companies consider it normal to throw away tons of money on advertising and PR, but they consider it inadmissible to invest this money in training.  What <i>can I</i> say: <i>I can not get 1-2 specialists from local companies</i> to speak <i>once a month at the user group and make more than tons of banners in the PR plan of their company!</i>  At the same time, at the university, everyone wants to try on the stars on his shoulders and nobody wants to let in ‚Äústrangers‚Äù ( <s>because they will look like you know it against the background of strangers</s> ). <br><br><h4>  And now we come to the most important thing. </h4><br>  We can hayat our education and bureaucracy for a long time (I do it myself, but this is not about that now), but as long as we do not have positive tendencies, we need to do something.  In Moscow, Kiev, Minsk there is a huge number of technical events, where you can get professional advice for $ 0.00.  There are many people (evangelicals, education managers, research program managers, MVP, MSP etc.) who will be happy to advise you on a course of action, sign up for programs, etc.  and so on (to skeptics - no need to say that these are adherents of ‚ÄúM $‚Äù or adherents of ‚ÄúG $‚Äù, because in the absolute majority they are professionals who do not allow themselves shouts in the style of ‚Äúsomething is there - r ** about"). <br><br>  Still a little bit of experience.  Very often I suggested that different people participate in the project ‚Äúfor knowledge‚Äù.  Those.  you write something to us (not a commercial code, not freelancing, but simply the realization of interesting ideas), <i>we teach you for free</i> .  Of about 20 people who went through me over the past year, only 2 (!) Gave a sane result.  The rest either disappeared or they were not interested. <br><br>  What is it talking about?  <i>The fact that people want everything at once, but do not want to do anything at the same time.</i> <br><br>  Even if your university is in the desert and all that you have is access to the network, this is <i>not a hopeless case</i> , and if there is still a computer class and a technical library, do not say that someone has prevented you from studying. <br><br>  So look for opportunities, not reasons. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/81766/">https://habr.com/ru/post/81766/</a></p>
