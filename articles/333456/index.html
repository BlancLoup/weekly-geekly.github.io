It remains to think about the delivery and launch of projects - and you can start selling.  Today we will just talk about a simple, but very important stage - the delivery of the project to the client. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Remember: the delivery of the project must be as fast as the sale.</b>  Otherwise, it runs the risk of delaying and the client will not receive their clients on time, and you will profit.  Do not over tighten.  But first get ready.

    <h3>  Request customer feedback </h3><br>  This is a very simple rule that should always be followed by everyone.  I put it in the first place.  From the very beginning of work on the site, the project manager should work on the client's feedback.  He should know that during the delivery of the project he will have to request a review from the client.  This should be spelled out in the regulations.  What is it done for?  First of all, reviews are the only thing that distinguishes you from young competitors who are working "in the negative", just to get customers.  Employees change, the portfolio becomes obsolete, and reviews remain.  This is a valuable asset to the company.  Secondly, a good review should affect the manager's premium more than other KPIs.  A good review - this means a sundress will work, the client will re-apply and take advantage of additional services. <br><br>  Our CRM is set up in such a way that when the project is switched to the ‚ÄúCompleted and Paid‚Äù status on behalf of the director, the client automatically receives a letter asking for feedback.  Even if the manager is ‚Äúnasty‚Äù and does not want to send a letter with a request for review, it will still be sent.  By the way, all 100% of reviews we have are real. <br><br><h3>  Conduct customer training </h3><br>  On the one hand, this is a rule of good tone (must have), on the other hand, it is a small trick, how to remove the flow of questions from the project manager from the client after the delivery of the project (he works on the flow and should lead new projects, not work with old ones) .  At the stage of putting the site manager offers a brief training on working with CMS.  He introduces the client to the support service, which conducts training and becomes the ‚Äúright hand‚Äù of the client‚Äôs representative in further work.  The project manager at the same time makes the transfer of the client to the technical support service completely and irrevocably. <br><br><h3>  Provide the customer with further steps. </h3><br>  Before launching the site, the client needs to be told where the first visitors will come from.  This is not a sale of advertising and promotion services.  This is a trivial educational program and ‚Äúrails‚Äù so that immediately after launching the site, the client does his job (receives calls and sells), and does not find fault with insignificant trifles that can be fixed infinitely. <br><br>  We do this in the form of email marketing.  Two steps before the site is completed (at the ‚ÄúDone‚Äù and ‚ÄúCompleted and Paid‚Äù stages) the client leaves the letters, where we tell what should happen to the site after hosting it.  Additionally, <a href="http://www.web-canape.ru/business/ecosystem_webcanape30_part1/%3Futm_source%3Darticle%26utm_medium%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_campaign%3Dpart6">we have prepared a small educational program for clients about Internet marketing</a> . <br><br>  But the task does not end there.  If you do not have your own advertising and promotion department, ‚Äústart your business relationship‚Äù with someone who can professionally set up advertising.  The client is already mentally ready to try the tools of Internet marketing, and after putting the site you should already have a proposal (preferably commercial) in hand what to do next.  You start advertising, you start promotion, the site works - the client is satisfied. <br><br><h3>  Knock the indicators of the project </h3><br>  Remember in the article " <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/twins/blog/310568/">Selection of the web studio team and the distribution of roles</a> " I asked to create a label with the project managers?  Here it is time to enter the data on the project in this tablet.  Specify the type of project submitted, the amount, set the hours spent on the project, count the number of days: how much the project actually was in operation (from the contractual terms we deduct the waiting time for a response from the client and receiving materials from it), count how much the project was in operation (all calendar days, including weekends, from the moment of payment until the moment of closing). <br><br>  In WebCanape, everything regarding deadlines is taken from CRM, where they are calculated automatically.  The hours spent by developers on the project, we take from the task manager (redmine) also automatically.  If you have a few projects, choose all these data by hand and make the plate is not difficult. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/3a2/9f1/bbd/3a29f1bbd4c14c58ba5a0683a5c92f60.png"><br>  <i>Fig.1.</i>  <i>Fragment of the project summary report at the end of the month</i> <br><br>  At the end of the month, the completed tablet for managers will tell us a lot of interesting things.  In more detail about indicators and their analysis I will write in the following material.  Now a few words for a general presentation.  Analyzing profitability by: <br><br><ul><li>  project amount and hours spent; </li><li>  on the norm days during which the project was in operation. </li></ul><br>  On calendar days we analyze the quality of the work of the manager as a manager.  On a review we make a conclusion about customer satisfaction.  All this ‚Äúmixture‚Äù of indicators will help us to build a balanced system of motivation, understandable for managers and managers, and will give information for the growth of managers on career steps. <br><br>  Of course, this is not all that you can do.  Each of you can add to this list.  We will be glad to hear suggestions and ideas.  On the way material about the monitoring of the production. <br>  Subscribe to <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/twins/">our blog on Habr√©</a> and join our party in a <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/AAAAAEBjZloMqYgTRq-4aw">telegram</a> . <br><br>  <a href="http://www.web-canape.ru/%3Futm_source%3Darticle%26utm_medium%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_campaign%3Dpart6">WebCanape</a> team </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/333456/">https://habr.com/ru/post/333456/</a></p>
