      Lies always and in different ways.  Due to the nature of his character, cultural add-ons and social restrictions.  To understand the category of "false" can only pre-understand the category of "truth." <br><br>  What is the "truth" in the modern world?  Very simple.  The truth today sounds like "Mine is mine, and yours is yours."  Right? <br><br>  Example.  Vasya was born in the capital, in a good time for the development of society (note, not according to his order and desire), in the family of high-ranking, polymorphic, developed, and with powerful promises for development, opportunities and connections for this.  Vasya - six-vector polymorph in high temperament.  In these circumstances, he managed with his mind and work to develop well, get a good education, work, and went straight up, reaching great heights and receiving a lot.  Everything is clear as day. <br><br>  His peer, Petya, was born in a village in a family of alcoholics, with a folder that left early and an early mother who died (note, also not according to your own order and desire, without choosing).  Single vector, without intellect bearing vectors.  Eight classes of high school is not finished.  He came to the outskirts of the capital, working at a construction site for meager wages. <br><br>  And now I, Vasya, already a famous banker, have a lot of money and am satisfied with life.  And he, Petya, although he certainly doesn‚Äôt need much, but he doesn‚Äôt even get his scanty salary for months and doesn‚Äôt even have this small amount he needs. <br><br>  And Vasya says to Petya (preferably through the TV, so it‚Äôs safer): <br><br>  - I'm Vasya!  All made myself!  His hard and hard work.  I!  He received a good education and made a career in manufacturing, and after that he organized a bank and became rich and happy.  And if you, Petya, were not a stupid, lazy, uneducated and non-initiating pig, but you would live and do everything as I did (with your work! Gentlemen, jurors, please note!), Then you would have everything (and the bank , and yacht, and beer, and a woman).  And so ... Blame only on yourself.  To each according to his work!  And I, Vasya, do not need someone else. <br><br>  That's all the great great truth of today.  ‚ÄúMine is mine!  Yours is yours! ‚Äù  Someone else is not necessary, but I will not give my own. <br><br>  But this is not so sad if it were not for one additional circumstance.  Today we do not even live in this category.  Pure animals, and even with increased egoism.  Today‚Äôs society, anyone, lives in LIE categories: ‚ÄúMine is mine!  And yours is <b>mine too</b> ! ‚Äù <br><br>  Roughly speaking, the same Vasya not only received the results of his work, but also robbed his bank, for example, for a thousand or two of this ‚Äúcattle‚Äù, ‚Äústupid pigs‚Äù, for the last of their crumbs.  And he considers this his own law, internally justifying his actions for himself. <br><br><h2>  Part two.  Theft, corruption and bribery. </h2><br>  Power, law, tradition - the main elements of the management of society in any state. <br><br>  For the Russian person, the power is felt as giving back to each according to lack.  The power of the merciful and just, in the deep unconscious of the whole nation, lays and creates, polishing for centuries, the unique mentality of the Russians.  Hoping for the Tsar-Batyushka, who will judge, the innocent will bestow, the bastards will chastise the dashing people to the joy of the people.  At the Tsar-Batyushka, who does good, and if there is no good from him, then the blasphemers cursed the bitter truth from the Tsar, keep him in ignorance, do not allow him to intercede for his people.  So come to him to bow and entrust the father-ruler, the god of the anointed, the bitter truth about the life of the people <br><br>  What could be the law over "divine authority"?  Yes, no - it is the law, one and indivisible.  Never deprive the Russians of their mentality, the mentality of justice and mercy. <br><br>  For this simple reason, the Law in the understanding of the Western community has never been created in Russia from Tsar Ivan to the present day.  Russian people have the deepest contempt for the law, for lawmaking as the work of human hands. <br><br>  The law is contrarian to the Russian mentality.  Based on which, the <a href="http://www.yburlan.ru/biblioteka/zvukovoi-vektor">Sound part of the</a> Russians is in the eternal search for analogues of the metaphysical disclosure of mercy and justice, spiritual altruism.  In the eternal spiritual search.  And here this spirit, this arrogance of egocentrism in <a href="http://www.yburlan.ru/biblioteka/zvukovoi-vektor">Sound</a> , this disregard of life in the body given by God, this courage of bestowal and will, the courage of the boundless steppe, not limited by the city‚Äôs fortifications, crazy happiness of being close to the metaphysical painful nature beats, leaving <a href="http://www.yburlan.ru/biblioteka/kozhniy-vektor">24% "Skin"</a> potential lawmakers beyond price and value ... <br><br>  Those who have never coped with the conduct of the divine control of hunger in the endless and cold Russia.  Eternal hunger, food shortages, a broken spear of a <a href="http://www.yburlan.ru/biblioteka/kozhniy-vektor">skin hunter</a> stuck in peat bogs, frozen in snow, lost in forests and not in alleyways of city suburbs, lost his artificial grades table for food intake and shamefully received his crust of bread from merciful power for free .  Archetypical <a href="http://www.yburlan.ru/biblioteka/kozhniy-vektor">skin measure</a> , undeveloped, predatory outside and thieves inside.  Totally stealing from below and totally corrupt from above.  Eternally inculcating in the robbery <a href="http://www.yburlan.ru/biblioteka/myshechnyi-vektor">muscle mass of the</a> population, dramatically soldering it today, undeveloped in hunting and in modern business (with a virtuoso caricature analogue of the merchants yesterday and today), unlimited by the walls of cities, having grown over the centuries not in the prohibition and restriction lawlessness and halyavshchyna ... <br><br>  At the exit we have a ‚Äúskin measure of the Russian bottling‚Äù - theft, corruption and bribery.  As it was 50 thousand years ago in a primitive flock, when theft was nothing more than a way to get food, so it remains to this day ... These conditional 24% of us, who are obliged to feed the remaining 76, have not learned how to get it any other way. grown to the requirements of a complex modern society, unable to restrict the primitive urges, neither their own nor others.  Social non-adapters ... children of a too caring parent ‚Äî a merciful <a href="http://www.yburlan.ru/biblioteka/zagadochnaya-russkaya-dusha">urethral mentality</a> ... <br><br>  The Russian people live on Justice, leaving no living place from the mechanism of the law.  Justice, which everyone applies in his own way ‚ÄúTrue False‚Äù, and while it will be so, learn to survive ‚Äúby notions‚Äù ... or disappear.  How not to enter into a deal with conscience and survive - in new releases.  Do not move away from the monitors! <br><br>  According to the materials of the training <a href="http://www.yburlan.ru/">system-vector psychology of Yuri Burlan</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/284140/">https://habr.com/ru/post/284140/</a></p>
