Obviously, the MJX company really tried to make the X800 so as to build trust in its products: good design and assembly, 6 screws, high-quality plastic and the coolest - the function of switching the console to the ‚ÄúGravity control‚Äù mode, when you control the inclinations with a stick , and the slopes of the console itself.  In this case, the function is not imposed, but complements the usual remote control, that is, you can be an ordinary pilot, but you can switch to the "magician and wizard" mode and control with one hand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4d3/465/e40/4d3465e40073437eb319dd87ba8134ee.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a>

      But let's order. <br><br><h2>  Appearance </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a9b/587/bd6/a9b587bd60b04e1587337d847c1aa032.jpg"><br>  So he looks in the box <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/029/ea0/a38/029ea0a381b84aae8d2e1c77a2f5c75f.jpg"><br>  So in the pre-flying state <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b09/ba0/714/b09ba071411e4241a6af5e1fd43d1119.jpg"><br><br>  And this is what its control panel looks like.  On the right, for comparison, is the console from my past favorite from the "small fry" - Syma X13, a review of which I have already <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/258968/">published</a> . <br><br><h2>  Specifications </h2><br>  <b>Flight time:</b> about 8 minutes <br>  <b>Charging time:</b> about 90 minutes <br>  <b>Size:</b> 21 x 21 x 5 cm <br>  <b>Battery:</b> 3.7V 750mAh (for comparison, for a larger Syma X5SW - only 500mAH) <br>  <b>Flight range:</b> About 150 meters <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/694/6f4/bc0/6946f4bc07e9406c8b7519ffc21f4bfa.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Functions </h2><br>  <b>Gravity control</b> <br>  The most interesting feature is the control by tilting the console.  Initially, the remote control and control is no different from ordinary quadcopters, but all you have to do is to move the right stick to the right, click on it and wait for the signal ‚Äî the tilt control intercepts the gyroscope. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0a4/838/afe/0a4838afeb504acf8f693be9dc20f830.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Backlight control</b> <br>  All controls on a single button under the right index finger.  Press - the backlight turns off, a second press turns it back on.  Most likely, the function is made to save battery during day flights, but I think when flying in the dark night, you can turn it off / on for fun or even piloting based on sound. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8e5/95b/2a9/8e595b2a91934437925e617b25896ff4.jpg"><br>  Two red lights tell us where the "ass". <br><br>  <b>Speed ‚Äã‚Äãcontrol</b> <br>  There are 3 flight modes: low, medium and high.  At the same time, the switching of modes is built in a very original way - on the button for turning on the control panel, where they belong.  Everything is signed: L, M, H - so it will be difficult to confuse.  In L (low) mode, I recommend mastering the control of the hexocopter, flying daily is better in M ‚Äã‚Äã(medium) mode, and in H (hight) mode, the X800 control becomes dangerous and mainly because pushing the stick to the stop means flip, that is, now in order to accelerate as much as possible it is necessary to incline the stick so as not to reach the extreme point of inclination, and if you catch up with it, the copter will immediately make a roll.  And it is very fun, but normally to fly in this mode with the habit is difficult. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/90c/2c9/350/90c2c9350a7b4b41ba6e6192762eaf47.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Flips</b> <br>  Flips can be done in any of the modes, I already told you about how they are obtained in the ‚ÄúH‚Äù mode, and in the L and M modes, the flips are caused artificially by pressing the button under the left index finger and the direction of the right stick in the right direction. <br><br>  <b>Stabilization</b> <br>  The six-axis stabilization system is able to pull it from any position if you are at least 3 meters from the ground.  But, I think, more importantly, the six propellers, working very smoothly, provide sufficient smoothness.  That is, if desired, and a certain skill, you can hang on the spot or just gently move in the right direction. <br><br><h2>  Equipment </h2><br>  Not to say that the equipment is very rich, but all the main things are there and particularly happy are 6 spare screws.  Some manufacturers forget about this stuff and the quadcopter can then lie around for a long time, waiting for the "spare wheel".  There is no such problem: charging, capacious battery, 6 screws, instructions, screwdriver and trick for safe removal of screws. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/352/8c5/825/3528c58251124a979bc10ab80bd022c0.jpg"><br><br><h2>  findings </h2><br>  I think we can say that MJX has entered the market with a successful product.  Hexocopter <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/ze">MJX X800</a> pleased with the quality and its capabilities.  Naturally, this is not the first model with tilt control, but it was the first to combine the functions of standard piloting and gyroscope-based control. <br><br>  Also very pleased with the range of flight - 150 meters.  I sincerely advise you not to fly that far, risking being left without a copter, but the fact that it is possible surprises and surprises pleasantly.  For comparison - competitors of similar size fly only 30-50 meters. <br><br>  The only thing that did not like is a strange battery replacement system, in order to replace which you have to unscrew a screw (!) With a screwdriver.  I suppose that the manufacturer considered that the majority would have enough of the standard 8 minutes of flight and they would not take a few spare batteries with them and would simply charge the copter without removing the batteries.  Well, maybe so, but I‚Äôll definitely take a screwdriver with me, or I‚Äôll just fly without a lid, which still only affects the appearance, not the strength of the installed battery. <br><br>  For those who are 8 minutes and the 1st battery is not enough - you can order another one for 750mAH for <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/h">$ 5.57</a> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Photos of how to get the battery</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ff9/ca7/f86/ff9ca7f864b04a26bf294ad97030b135.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b9f/6fc/2f0/b9f6fc2f06d44c84861eabebe70421ba.jpg"><br></div></div><br><br>  Summing up, I‚Äôll say that the MJX X800 is extremely versatile, so you can have fun at home and frolic in the street, but it‚Äôs especially nice that they all fit in <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/ze">at $ 30.40</a> .  MJX brought new interesting solutions to the market, both in usability and functionality, while managing to keep good quality within the limits of the stated price.  I am sure that many manufacturers will take these decisions on a note. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c51/02d/62b/c5102d62bb954b57ac681ef34f57e145.jpg"><br><br>  That's all, successful flight, you wish service on the choice of quadrocopters <a href="http://dronk.ru/">Dronk.Ru</a> <br>  Do not forget to subscribe to our <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/">blog</a> , there will be many more interesting things. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/366275/">https://habr.com/ru/post/366275/</a></p>
