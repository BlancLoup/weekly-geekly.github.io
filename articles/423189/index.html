  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Research: half the companies patch vulnerabilities during the month - why?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Researchers at Kollective, a company engaged in the development of software-defined content delivery networks, conducted a survey among two hundred American and British organizations.  They <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/08/22/patching_survey/">found</a> that almost half of the companies needed a month to close a known vulnerability.  Let us tell why this is happening, and what can be done about it. <br><br> <a href="https://habr.com/company/1cloud/blog/423189/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/00/u-/mg/00u-mgn_r8ohxuwx9lfxvyhlga8.jpeg"></a> <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>/ <a href="https://pxhere.com/en/photo/738370">Pxhere</a> / <a href="https://pxhere.com/en/photo/738370">pd</a></i></font> <br><br><h2>  Companies install patches too long </h2><br>  Kollective survey was conducted among the heads of IT-departments.  45% of respondents from large corporations (which have more than 100 thousand network terminals) answered that they need approximately 30 days to install a patch.  Another 27% said that sometimes it takes several months to install updates.

      In the face of a growing number of cyber threats, this approach seems unacceptable.  According to Symantec, last year the number of ransomware attacks <a href="https://www.symantec.com/security-center/threat-report">increased</a> by 36%.  At the same time, it is known that more than 230 thousand malware samples <a href="https://thebestvpn.com/cyber-security-statistics-2018/">appear</a> every day. <br><br>  In this regard, over the past two years, the time to install the patch, which the company has before the attackers take advantage of the vulnerability, <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow-assets/public/en-us/doc-type/resource-center/analyst-report/ponemon-state-of-vulnerability-response.pdf">has decreased</a> by 29%.  However, a simple security update is still one of the most effective ways to protect.  In many data hacks and mergers, hackers exploit vulnerabilities for which a patch has already been released. <br><br>  ServiceNow surveyed 3,000 security specialists from around the world and found out that 56% of companies could have avoided information dumping in the past if they had installed the update in time.  An example would be the <a href="https://habr.com/company/1cloud/blog/349116/">massive theft of personal data</a> from Equifax in the United States.  Then the PD leaked more than 140 million Americans. <br><br>  This incident could have been avoided if the experts of the credit bureaus set the patch in time.  Hackers exploited a vulnerability in the Apache Struts framework ( <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi%3Fname%3DCVE-2017-5638">CVE-2017-5638</a> ) related to an error handling exception.  A patch for this vulnerability was released <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2017/09/14/equifax-identity-theft-hackers-apache-struts/665100001/">two months</a> before the attack on Equifax. <br><br><h2>  Why delay updates </h2><br>  <b>1. Shortage of staff.</b>  Information security departments suffer from a lack of qualified specialists.  According <a href="http://paymentsjournal.com/payments-and-cybersecurity-why-automating-threat-breach-response-is-critical/">to the</a> non-profit organization ISACA, by 2019 there will be a shortage of information security personnel in the industry.  Shortage will be approximately 2 million people. <br><br>  This already directly affects the protection of organizations against cyber attacks.  In a 2016 McAfee <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/assets/reports/rp-hacking-skills-shortage.pdf">study</a> , a quarter of respondents said that the lack of information security experts at their company caused data leaks. <br><br>  <b>2. Inefficient patch management.</b>  However, the expansion of the staff of information security specialists in a company does not always lead to an increase in the reliability of the IT infrastructure.  In ServiceNow, it is noted that there is no need to wait for security enhancements until the patching business processes are modified. <br><br>  The speed of closing vulnerabilities is affected by a large number of manual processes.  There are companies that still use Excel to manage the patch.  One company from the Fortune 100 even formed a whole department of employees <a href="https://servicematters.servicenow.com/2018/04/05/survey-hiring-more-talent-alone-wont-solve-securitys-woes/">responsible for managing spreadsheets</a> with data about vulnerabilities - they write there, whether there is a patch, who installs it, etc. <br><br>  According <a href="https://blog.trendmicro.com/wannacry-reality-of-patching/">to</a> Mark Nunnikhoven, vice president of cloud research at Trend Micro, the lack of automation of IT systems update processes in companies has become one of the main reasons for the widespread use of WannaCry. <br><br>  <b>3. The difficulty of prioritizing updates.</b>  According to the publication of the CSO, another <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3025807/data-protection/why-patching-is-still-a-problem-and-how-to-fix-it.html">reason for the</a> slow updating of systems is too many patches.  Security professionals find it difficult to prioritize and decide which ones need to be set before others.  Even in the case of Specter and Meltdown, experts <a href="https://www.itworldcanada.com/article/patching-meltdown-spectre-take-your-time-or-get-to-it-fast/400448">expressed</a> opposite opinions: some experts suggested waiting, while others were in a hurry to install patches quickly. <br><br>  The situation is also complicated by the slow replenishment of databases with vulnerabilities.  By August of this year, more than 3,000 threats from those that were found from January to June 2018 <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/08/14/record_software_vulnerabilities/">did not hit</a> CVE and NVD databases. Almost half of them received the highest danger rating on CVSSv2. <br><br>  <b>4. The complexity of the installation.</b>  The company Barkly conducted a survey on the installation of updates Meltdown and Specter among security specialists.  80% of respondents <a href="https://blog.barkly.com/meltdown-and-spectre-patching-statistics">considered the</a> process of installing patches to close vulnerabilities in Intel chips "unclear". <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúWhen Meltdown and Specter appeared, there was no convenient test utility to detect these vulnerabilities.  Over time, utilities began to appear, but it was impossible to guarantee their reliability, - says Sergey Belkin, head of development at <a href="https://1cloud.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dcpm%26utm_campaign%3Dpatch%26utm_content%3Dblog">1cloud</a> .  - Later, Microsoft <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4073119/protect-against-speculative-execution-side-channel-vulnerabilities-in">offered a</a> method of verification, but it was also quite complicated.  But then there were solutions (in particular, <a href="https://www.maketecheasier.com/check-linux-meltdown-spectre-vulnerability/">for a number of Linux distributions</a> ), which allowed to find out whether Meltdown and Specter are affected or not, with a single command in the console. ‚Äù </blockquote><br><h2>  How to increase the speed of updates </h2><br>  <b>1. Automate the installation of patches.</b>  Automating the upgrade process simplifies the task for administrators and end users.  The system itself downloads patches from the Internet, and the system administrator remains to follow the installation process.  This is especially important for cloud providers, since they manage a huge number of "machines". <br><br>  There are tools (for example, HPE Server Automation) that centrally update the operating systems on the data center servers.  They allow you to select the necessary patches offered by the OS vendor.  Even with their help, you can customize the installation process itself, for example, to exclude updates that are not suitable for a particular environment. <br><br>  <b>2. Educate employees.</b>  People play an important role in ensuring data security.  Therefore, it is necessary to raise the awareness of IT specialists and ordinary employees of the company, to invest money and time, at least, in conducting basic cyberhygiene courses. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5m/kq/tn/5mkqtnc8q4iateek9b7e7l4ugi4.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>/ Flickr / <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/kellyhogaboom/7449144970">kelly</a> / <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">cc</a></i></font> <br><br>  In general, a variety of methods can be used to better assimilate knowledge about data security, such as gamification.  The Australian division of PricewaterhouseCoopers <a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/news/450301929/PwC-Australia-uses-gamification-to-teach-cyber-security-lessons">holds</a> Game of Threats among its customers when teams of ‚Äúhackers‚Äù and ‚Äúsystem defenders‚Äù compete in a special simulator. <br><br>  <b>3. Invest more in cybersecurity.</b>  According to Gartner, in 2018, cybersecurity costs of organizations <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2018-08-15-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-information-security-spending-to-exceed-124-billion-in-2019">will increase</a> by 12.4% compared with last year.  Firms will <a href="https://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3836563">spend</a> more money on automating processes and new data protection technologies so that information security professionals can work more efficiently. <br><br><h2>  What's next </h2><br>  Slow installation of security updates is a system problem.  And, probably, it will deliver "inconvenience" for quite a long time, especially in light of the discovery of new major vulnerabilities of processors, for example, <a href="https://www.computerworld.ru/articles/V-Intel-priznali-nalichie-v-protsessorah-esche-odnoy-dyry">Foreshadow</a> .  However, if more companies start to install patches quickly, this will have a positive effect on the entire ecosystem and significantly reduce the number of leaks of personal data.  Similar to the one that happened with Equifax. <br><br><h5>  A couple more posts from the corporate blog 1cloud: </h5><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://1cloud.ru/blog/bezopasnost-dannih-v-oblake%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dcpm%26utm_campaign%3Dpatch%26utm_content%3Dblog">How secure data is in the cloud</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://1cloud.ru/blog/virtualnyj-kompyuter-zapushchennyj-v-oblake-luchshe-schitat-zheleznym%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dcpm%26utm_campaign%3Dpatch%26utm_content%3Dblog">What is rented infrastructure better than the usual "iron"</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://1cloud.ru/blog/oblachnyj-server-dlja-praktiki-sysadmina%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dcpm%26utm_campaign%3Dpatch%26utm_content%3Dblog">The training stand for admins: how the cloud will help</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://1cloud.ru/blog/chto-takoe-net-core%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dcpm%26utm_campaign%3Dpatch%26utm_content%3Dblog">What opportunities does .NET Core give developers?</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/423189/">https://habr.com/ru/post/423189/</a></p>
