  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mentioner - how we chose the location for the headquarters deployment</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At first, a small joke: <br>  <i>‚ÄúHave you ordered a fight?‚Äù</i>  <i>- NOT!</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Late!</i>  <i>Paid! ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  The previous post caused a merry foray of "silent minus".  We can not leave them without favorite activities and offer new material for otkhabra.  Moreover, we, like the heroes of the anecdote, ‚Äúpaid off‚Äù for a corporate blog, for as much as 3 months (and then we'll see in return, but for now I like everything).  Therefore, minusation does not bother us and is even interesting as an indicator of compatibility with the audience specifically Habra.  :-) <br><br>  At first we wrote a huge 15 kilobyte text.  It was a point-by-point layout, why we chose an office not in Moscow, but took a shack 100 km from Samara, brought optics there and held a telephone without doing any repairs, being content for the first time with ‚ÄúEuropean-quality repair‚Äù out of 90 x and furniture from the 80s (but no, normal chairs, all the same bought in Ikea). 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      And then they realized that it was not interesting to anyone and made this short text about anything (sarcasm), which has only one goal - to once again light up the <a href="http://upominator.ru/">Reminder</a> . <a name="habracut"></a>  So: <br><br>  We are building the <b>Reminder</b> , which should eat as little money as possible (so that advertisers lose their balance when replenishing their balance, and the mentioners (our partners who place paid mentions) receive 75% of their earnings. The remaining 25% will go to pay our expenses.).  At the same time, we want to ensure a reasonable balance between the quality of service (try calling ‚ÄúBlogun‚Äù? But first find its phone number :-)) and its price.  Therefore, our programmer works at home in the suburbs, and we hired designers and designers (website, interface ‚Äúinternal‚Äù and logo) and we hire at part time (one designer from Moscow, the second from Kiev, our visual should not be on par with no rural bydlostayla in style "Hello from '96").  The office is located on the periphery, we hire people into it who do not claim 2-3 thousand dollars of salary and (oddly enough!) They still sometimes work.  Our support and billing will be not in India and not in Mariupol, but near Samara (Otradny, 50 thousand people on Wikipedia).  This is profitable and promising, as there are already 9 operating schools, a university representative office and a college in the town.  Therefore, we will have no problems with a more or less literate staff, since at the end of the educational institutions young people are quite ready (almost everyone is on social networks, have mailboxes and are quite self-oriented on the Web, and will be able to train them) support and billing (in the city WiMax appeared earlier than Yota in Moscow), so we will be the best employer after Rosneft (which you don‚Äôt fit in without relatives) and the flooring plant (keep silent hussars! :-)) which all the authorities of Moscow and local with VO work waters  loader trucks).  Nearby passes the railway (the night of the way to Moscow).  And also only 70 km.  to the international airport (Germany, Moscow-Peter every day, or through Kaliningrad to Europe - with a whistle).  To Moscow, 1.5 hours of flight, VNK, DMD, SVO to choose from (respectively, you can choose on what to get - on the "T-shke", "Airbus" or "Boeing" - prices are different, but not radically, plus there are flights with discounts) .  Also, about 100 km on a flat road to the nearest shopping center, which is not worse than the Moscow Atrium in terms of range and entertainment (by the way, it is preparing for the start of Mega and Ikea, and about Auchan, Ramstor and Perekrestok and say nothing - they already have.). <br><br>  According to the results: of course, we don‚Äôt have Silicon Valley, but we have the necessary infrastructure for living and working, as well as people.  We are raising the headquarters of the IT offices of the federal and CIS-shnogo level in such a way ... that the costs for the project office (from Internet to lunch, water transport and salaries) will be completely incomparable with similar costs for a similar set of features in Moscow or any another major city.  While the phone number will be local rural (+ 7846614XXXX - will be posted on the site), connecting directly to the office of the Moscow multichannel number via VoIP is in progress. <br><br>  What's next: Now we rent a room in the building of our kibbutz pension fund ( <a href="">our windows to the left of the entrance on the first floor</a> ), but we want to build something separate for the future (and it would be strange if we didn‚Äôt want).  Certainly not as global as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googleplex">Googleplex</a> or <a href="">Oracle</a> office, but more or less modern and convenient.  <a href="">For example, here it is</a> , or <a href="http://www.novate.ru/blogs/140609/12250/">here it is</a> .  Everything is real and not worth incredible thousands, builders with hands growing from the right places too, not all the same time to build a five-wall house to them :-).  The land acquisition (as well as the supply of communications) on the periphery is not as corrupt as in the center.  Moreover, oddly enough, not all brakes are at the mercy of power, and small cities sometimes find it very interesting to get new businesses, because this is at least money coming in the form of wages and young people remaining in the city. <br><br>  Photos of the room and in general about our forests and fields - will be in one of the following posts.  :-) <br><br>  PS <a href="http://upominator.ru/">Mentioner</a> - Internet advertising has never been like this! <br>  Start in February 2010. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/84087/">https://habr.com/ru/post/84087/</a></p>
