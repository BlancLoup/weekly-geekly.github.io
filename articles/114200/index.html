  <section class="page js-page"><h1>SEO - promotion of a client or website?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day everyone! <br>  To promote our <a href="http://hosting.tel.ru/">hosting.tel.ru</a> website, we decided to use the services of professional optimizers.  All had an impressive portfolio, experience in promoting requests of varying complexity, they were ready to provide examples of work performed, but no one agreed to give results (at least some).  We, of course, have heard a lot about the frequently changing algorithms of Yandex, Google, about sinister Platons and other problems, but we do not understand why these problems should become ours.  It seems to be logical that paying the money, we must expect to see the result ... We do not think that our customers would be delighted if we promised a rent of <i>10 or 20 servers</i> for a certain amount <i>depending on the geomagnetic situation</i> .  Today we decided to please Habr with only some examples of interaction with SEO-specialists. <br><br>  <b>Keyword selection</b> <br>  Despite the fact that everyone promises effective promotion for targeted inquiries, the suggested keywords speak more about efficient leaching of money from customers.  Is it really not possible to use the concept of <i>general queries</i> in textbooks on SEO?  Of course, everyone understands that for the promotion of the <i>hosting</i> request you can pull out more money.  But how much will this request be targeted for the promotion of data center services?  Yandex statistics stubbornly asserts that most of the requests that include the word ‚Äúhosting‚Äù can not be completely attributed to those that interest us: <i>free hosting, image hosting, file hosting, image hosting</i> ... <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/0957c93c/af3dc5bc/55ac089b/1d07accf.jpg"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Project's budget</b> <br>  The method of budgeting for promotion and its transparency is a separate issue.  Information about how the budget is distributed between, for example, the purchase of links and the work of copywriters is not provided.  Even more surprising is the formula: budget = costs for promotion in Yandex + costs for promotion in Google.  Of course, search engines have their own characteristics, but, to consider them as two independent components, at least, is somehow strange.  The site, displayed in the TOP-10 in Google, will remain in the issuance of Yandex in the same positions?

      <b>Traffic</b> <br>  Good attendance is fine, but not always.  After the magical actions of some promoters, our site had hundreds of transitions from such resources ... Not only is it useless, it‚Äôs also inconvenient - it becomes impossible to analyze statistics.  Do optimizers hope that customers do not look for sources of transitions ... <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/9b4ceae8/32a2e51e/d1a6e139/45c808ec.jpg"></div><br><br>  <b>Timing</b> <br>  The standard term for concluding a contract is three months.  <i>After that, you can judge any results ...</i> A very interesting point, if the results obtained are not satisfied.  The problem is that almost no one works with the exchanges of buying <b>eternal links</b> .  Most optimizers buy links with time-based payment in sape.ru and other similar services.  Accordingly, when the contract is terminated, the links are removed, and the site, after a while, ‚Äúrolls back‚Äù to its previous positions.  Money wasted.  You can, of course, continue to work, but where are the guarantees that the result will appear in another three months?  Sorry for the investment, but continue to continue throwing money down the drain does not make sense. <br><br>  <b>Budget allocation</b> <br>  <i>For a sharp and massive increase in links, the site risks falling under the sanctions of search engines, so the intensity of optimization work should be gradually increased</i> .  It is quite possible, but in this case, the budget should be at least in proportion to the costs.  If the links for the first month of work are bought many times less than for the rest, then why is the same price set for each of the periods? <br><br>  <b>Total</b> <br>  In the material we have listed only some of the controversial situations that have arisen, in our case when communicating with SEOs.  Of course, it is impossible to call all of the above, the usual ‚Äúdivorce‚Äù, because the clients themselves agree to such conditions.  But it is surprising that such conditions are offered to companies that are ‚Äúslightly in topic‚Äù because they are directly connected with Internet activities.  It is terrible to even imagine how things are going with ‚Äúplastic windows‚Äù, ‚Äúcargo transportation‚Äù and ‚Äúdental clinics‚Äù. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/114200/">https://habr.com/ru/post/114200/</a></p>
