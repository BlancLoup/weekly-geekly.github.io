She is familiar with modern technologies and is well-versed in the Internet (especially in LJ :)), but she didn‚Äôt need a smartphone.  It turned out that the old phone began to work poorly, and there was no camera in it.  In addition, the mother does not see very well, and the large on-screen buttons would be very useful to her.  ‚ÄúOnly the simplest!‚Äù She asked.  It is said - done, and in front of me was the Samsung Galaxy Pocket Neo. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/45b/317/ad1/45b317ad1d1115fa4885033c4b5d8d58.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/287/5bc/5ef/2875bc5ef5ea86fdb98625d3247c890e.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I purchased it from an operator with a contract for 4 months for 2,990 rubles. It turned out no more expensive than ‚Äúonly a smartphone‚Äù in other places, and a 4GB microSD card was presented as well.  And unlock it is simple: you need to enter the unlock code once when installing someone else's SIM card. <br>  It is really quite simple and inexpensive, but at the same time - modern, on Android 4.1. <br><br><h4>  How does it look </h4><br>  The smartphone is available in white, blue or gray case, I got the last one.  It is well assembled, the back cover can be removed quite easily, without sharp objects.  Connectors for connections were on top (headphones, not included) and below (microUSB, in the box are separate cables for charging and synchronization).

Everything is familiar. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/0fa/a49/fc9/0faa49fc9d2f1b00b07104f259e98d23.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/818/039/acb/818039acbfdc72f9f01b2e7e8a377e0e.jpg"><br>  Three-inch screen with a resolution of 240 x 320 pixels will seem small to many.  But personally, I have been walking with a simple smartphone for 3.2 inches for almost two years and, honestly, I do not feel inconvenient. <br>  The display is reminiscent of old phones, where so many inches was the limit.  Yes, and selected classic wallpaper, with flowers and leaves.  This is part of his charm.  Viewing angles are average, but the color reproduction is not bad. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/bb4/8b4/8b1/bb48b48b19f6fee68ff45cd6f55c8060.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/17f/b05/ec4/17fb05ec40722de7c700d1fc5d62b53c.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/87e/b1a/629/87eb1a62930f685e7e5c1dcfb228f8cd.jpg"><br><br><h4>  What can </h4><br>  The processor at 850 MHz and 512 MB of RAM is not enough for resource-intensive games, but office applications, performance tests and other not very demanding programs work fine.  In the smartphone 4 GB of memory, supported cards up to 32 GB. <br>  The performance test gives it a little more than 5 thousand points, and it overtakes not new, but more advanced smart phones, like its Sony Ericsson production. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/aac/227/1d4/aac2271d4923a7a073d977d04b404baa.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/d24/a9c/adc/d24a9cadc2cdc2fa7f372e36cc2b5943.jpg"><br><br>  A pleasant surprise was the presence of a GPS module and even GLONASS, and communication with satellites is stable. <br>  The telephone part looks quite standard. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/814/bdd/108/814bdd108326d91b88f2f390d8a3cd9f.jpg"><br>  Since my mother needed a camera, I checked the quality of the pictures before buying.  In the reviews about this model they write that the photos are very bad, but I did not think so.  By the way, there are no flashes from the camera, but there is autofocus.  At the same time, many much more advanced smartphones do not shoot better, while having not two, but five or even more megapixels.  I think you need to compare more models before buying, then it will be clear where it‚Äôs bad and where it‚Äôs not. <br>  For an example - photos without preparation and processing at artificial and natural lighting. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/6d9/db5/7d7/6d9db57d7a8ec4059bc66054e9be01fe.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/c8c/752/780/c8c752780024ba230d780f4864856aab.jpg"><br><br>  Due to the modest filling of the 1200 mAh battery, it lasts a day for 3-4, and this is exactly what matters to the older generation.  The micro-SIM slot is a little sad, but operators usually change SIM cards for free, and an adapter can be purchased for use in other phones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/a2d/f17/0f4/a2df170f4d17395d0b3a06eb38c7eab3.jpg"><br><br><h4>  What can not </h4><br>  Now about the reverse side of the coin.  It is clear that the eminent manufacturer has removed some functions for the sake of cheaper smartphone. <br>  Under the distribution got the proximity sensor.  When you hold the handset to your ear, the display simply turns off, and then to turn it on, you need to double tap. <br>  There is no front camera in the smartphone.  In my case, it does not matter - no one in the family uses video calls, but there are computers for Skype. <br>  You can‚Äôt take a screenshot from the screen with the standard ‚Äúpower + volume down‚Äù combination, but ‚Äúpower + Home‚Äù works like in some other Samsung smartphones.  But, to tell the truth, apart from the authors of the reviews, this is very few people need :) <br>  Perhaps most of all I was upset by the appearance of the Samsung on-screen keyboard on a display of this size.  In the Russian layout, the letters are quite small (even bigger in English), the buttons are narrow - try to get hit!  It is convenient to type or in the horizontal orientation, or on the old school keyboard 3x4. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/4ec/82f/e81/4ec82fe81a85de96d25cc1a3d5bfefdf.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/15e/860/d4b/15e860d4b603102ead0e1855db5158f2.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/7ec/bb9/e85/7ecbb9e8567d16d7f21e6c6fcdb109af.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Summary </h4><br>  Samsung Galaxy Pocket Neo has no competitors in its price gap, except for very little-known models.  If you add a thousand rubles, you can buy a much more advanced Highscreen Spark - with a front-facing camera, a 4-inch display, and even a dual-core processor, and for five thousand another pair of bonuses will be added.  But I was asked to buy the simplest dialer with a camera, so as not to run every day to the outlet, and the Pocket Neo handles these tasks perfectly.  By the way, my mother got rid of him in a couple of minutes and is happy. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/191698/">https://habr.com/ru/post/191698/</a></p>
