  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Russian Design Cup</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi, Habr.  I have always wondered why there are so many all-around contests for programmers, and so few contests for web designers and designers.  As you all know very well, many people still consider the result of the designer‚Äôs work with photo hats with clip art and icons with gradients.  In reality, in large complex projects, the tasks of a designer-designer are much broader and more interesting: they include the elaboration of human interaction with the interface, and work with restrictions, development of guidelines and decomposition of scenarios for quick release.  A designer cannot do without the skills of presenting his work, without the ability to handle criticism and quickly respond to changing priorities. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ebd/fb0/79e/ebdfb079e1761a630c522293b4f8a572.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Coming up with the <a href="http://russiandesigncup.ru/">Russian Design Cup</a> , we set ourselves several tasks: <a name="habracut"></a><br><ul><li>  show interesting examples of the challenges we face in our companies; </li><li>  to attract the attention of novice designers, to interest them in the specifics of work on our projects; </li><li>  enable designers from related industries to try their hand at UX-UI-design; </li><li>  just get experience in organizing such contests;  if the first pancake is not ‚Äúvery lumpy‚Äù and we see interest in the competition, we will definitely work on the mistakes and repeat it next year; </li><li>  and, anticipating some commentators, of course, steal all the brilliant ideas of designers, implement them overnight and do not pay anything to anyone. </li></ul><br>  All members of the jury are involved in writing the tasks.  The complexity of the tasks will increase from tour to tour.  Some of them will be serious and will require thoughtful analysis, some, on the contrary, will allow to approach the decision as creatively as possible.  The first round will go a whole month, the participants will have enough time to think out solutions. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      The format for presenting solutions is free - do it your way.  Footnotes, links, wireless frames, graphical user interface, text descriptions.  I am sure that the way the designer presents his work will influence the jury's assessment.  In assessing, we will not see whose decision is in front of us.  Voting will be closed - if you pass (or fail) in the next round, you will simply receive a letter about it. <br><br>  Since the project is an initiative of designers and practically an experiment - we were limited in resources, and we made only minimal functionality that will allow holding a competition.  Without profiles, passwords and Internet polls, each participant will have a unique link by which he will get access to tasks and results. <br><br>  We also have an idea - after the end of the competition, we post somewhere all the work, so that the participants and any other people can familiarize themselves with all the decisions, discuss and go about them, what do you say? <br><br>  That is the most important thing that I wanted to tell.  Details of the rules and organization can be found on the competition website.  Ask questions in the comments - I will, if possible, answer and update the post. <br><br><h4>  And for a snack text from our PR </h4><br>  We invite designers and designers to take part in the competition of Russian Design Cup.  Russian Design Cup is the first such open competition held in Russia and neighboring countries.  We want it to become a platform where talented designers and interface designers will be able to try their hand and demonstrate mastery.  RDC will allow designers from all over the country to express themselves and open up new perspectives for them.  In turn, the industry, thanks to the Russian Design Cup, learns about talented specialists.  Competitive tasks will be based on real tasks that designers encounter during the work process.  Choose the best work will be the heads of design departments of leading IT-companies - Mail.Ru Group, Rambler, Yandex. <br><br><h5>  The most honest jury: </h5><br><ul><li>  Yuri Vetrov, head of the interface design and design for the Mail.Ru Group </li><li>  Oleg Andrianov, designer Mail.Ru Group </li><li>  Dmitry Zimin, head of interface design for Rambler and Afish OK </li><li>  Konstantin Gorsky, Head of Web Interfaces Design, Yandex </li><li>  Alisher Yakupov, Head of Odnoklassniki Social Network Design, Mail.Ru Group Project </li></ul><br><br>  At the moment, the Russian Design Cup website is registering participants.  More than 500 applications have already been submitted for participation in the competition.  Apply and you. <br><br><h5>  When and where? </h5><br>  The competition will be held from July 1 to August 11 on the site <a href="http://russiandesigncup.ru/">russiandesigncup.ru</a> <br>  What do you need to take part? <br>  You can take part in the competition if you are 18 years old or more, you are not an employee or a close relative of the Mail.Ru Group employee. <br><br><h5>  What are the tests? </h5><br>  Participants have to overcome three stages - qualifying, qualifying and final round. <br>  During each of the stages, participants will be asked to solve from 1 to 3 problems in the field of interface design. <br><br><h5>  And, of course, prizes </h5><br>  Three finalists will be awarded Apple equipment in the maximum configuration.  The first place winner will receive a 27-inch Apple iMac, a 13-inch MacBook Air and an iPad, respectively, rely on second and third places. <br><br>  Follow the contest in the official twitter RDC <a href="https://twitter.com/RDesignCup">twitter.com/RDesignCup</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/146339/">https://habr.com/ru/post/146339/</a></p>
