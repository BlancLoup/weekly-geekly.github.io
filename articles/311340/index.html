    <h2>  What is neuromarketing? </h2><br>  Neuromarketing is a marketing research that uses brain science techniques and technologies.  Neuromarketing allows you to determine, for example, who the target audience of a brand is. <br><br><blockquote><p>  <em>‚ÄúThe most famous neuromarketing technology in the world, entitled‚Äú The method of extracting Zaltman‚Äôs metaphors, ‚Äùby Harvard University professor Jerry Zaltman, developed at the end of the last century.</em>  <em>It is based on the impact on the subconscious of a person through graphic images.</em>  <em>The scientist found out that the correctly chosen picture activates the hidden images-metaphors that are born unconsciously and cause positive emotions that induce a person to make a purchase.</em>  <em>Today, Procter &amp; Gamble, General Motors and other leading companies identify the images they need, after which they build the schedule of their commercials based on them. ‚Äù</em> </p></blockquote><br><h2>  What do advertisers want to know? </h2><br>  Neuromarketing is now most actively engaged in advertising testing.  The main question with which clients come to neuromarketing specialists is: ‚ÄúWhy doesn‚Äôt the target audience see and accept the concept that I came up with?‚Äù. <br><br>  State-owned companies evaluate the effectiveness of social advertising with the help of neuromarketing research: how the population relates to a particular topic, how to convey the meaning of the reform to a certain circle of people. <br><br>  Researchers offer companies technology that can help find the most perceived image, the one that will be the easiest to convey to consumers. <br><br><blockquote><p>  <em>‚ÄúWhen a person catches a glimpse of a brand‚Äôs logo, he doesn‚Äôt have the opportunity to analyze it, but the brain manages to process what he sees.</em>  <em>So, if a person encounters this image again, he will perceive it as something familiar, will have greater confidence in the company and, in the end, will give it preference when buying. ‚Äù</em> </p></blockquote><br><h2>  How are the studies? </h2><br>  The customer formulates the task - it could be, for example, brand promotion or strengthening of positions in the market.  After that, the neuromarketing company gives recruiting agencies a description of the target audience and selects people for research. <br><br>  At the next stage, people are invited to the laboratory for research using special equipment.  With the help of devices register human neurophysiological parameters. <br><br><ul><li>  Ai trackers (‚Äúeye tracking‚Äù) record eye movements and track gaze coordinates (exactly where you look).  They are used to study the attention and interest of respondents. </li><li>  A high-resolution camera helps analyze micromimics to identify emotions (surprise, fear, irritation, joy, and other emotions). </li><li>  A polygraph (‚Äúlie detector‚Äù) is used to record respiration, indicators of cardiovascular activity, and electrical resistance of the skin.  The polygraph is used to assess emotional involvement. </li><li>  Electroencephalograph records the bioelectric activity of the brain. </li></ul><br>  Usually, all instruments are used simultaneously in research.  People are shown a video of the company and take data: indicators of attention, interest, memory, engagement and cognitive load. <br><br>  The main tasks in neuromarketing are to correctly capture and interpret data.  After analyzing the data, the researchers provide the customer with a report with recommendations.  The whole procedure takes about five to seven days. <br><br><blockquote><p>  <em>‚ÄúResearch by the neuromarketing agency SalesBrain has shown that active smartphone users are influenced by advertising more than those who like to watch TV.</em>  <em>A person experiences more positive emotions when he sees an ad on the screen of a mobile device.</em>  <em>According to Google and Nielsen, 28% of people who search the Internet for an hour using a phone or tablet make a purchase, and 55% come to the store. ‚Äù</em> </p></blockquote><br><h2>  What Russian brands use neuromarketing? </h2><br>  Leading Russian mobile operators, Cherkizovo, Borjomi, Faberlic and others.  Neurotrend tested the movies Yolki 1914, both parts Bitter, Legend No. 17, The Crew. <br><br><h2>  How much does neuromarketing research cost? </h2><br>  The average cost of a full study - from 300 to 700 thousand rubles. <br><br><h2>  Is it ethical to conduct such research? </h2><br>  Neuromarketing is simply a new method of obtaining data in marketing.  Researchers can make an in-depth analysis of consumer behavior, but they do not affect it.  The law on advertising prohibits a hidden impact on a person. <br><br>  However, technologies will evolve and in the future it will be possible to simplify data acquisition and obtain information about consumers without putting on instruments on it.  This will entail a lot of ethical problems - a person may not know that he is participating in testing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/750/dc1/369/750dc1369ae65773d35bef95d5f4c823.gif" alt="giphy" width="470" height="470"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/311340/">https://habr.com/ru/post/311340/</a></p>
