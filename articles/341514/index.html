  <section class="page js-page"><h1>ITSM lived, ITSM alive, ITSM will live</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Do you live according to the principles of ITIL?  Maybe you keep a four-volume book of 2000 pages on the tables together, wear the cherished badge and use the best practices?  We are 99% sure that this is not about you.  But the fact that you constantly use the elements of ITSM in the administration of the IT infrastructure and in dealing with incidents is a fact, even if you yourself do not suspect it.  And this is done by hundreds of companies, from giants like Russian Railways to small firms.  And they also get together and share experiences, which eventually translate into hundreds of other companies and make life easier for system administrators.  For this there is the annual ITSMF conference - we were there, listened and discussed the reports, at the competitors' stands, we conducted <s>reconnaissance work</s> friendly dialogues, and at the same time we recorded a lot and took some pictures - especially for Habr.  Valuable insights, news and just funny moments - inside. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/alloy_software/blog/341514/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/576/8c7/a43/5768c7a43ad735893fe65d3219943891.png"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#20155e">ITIL is dead, long live ITIL</font> </h2><br>  The spirit of ITIL is hovering over the whole conference space, and this cannot be taken away - among the crowd you can meet people with a cherished green badge, ITIL founding fathers, gurus and experts of international class.  But this year was a little sad and optimistic at the same time. <br><br>  Of course, the best practices, designed in the four-volume, which is updated every 10 years, in the modern world of explosive IT development have no chance of being anything more than a fetish and a subject of study.  That is, the practical value is lost day by day.  And it was surprising and at the same time nice to hear from the legendary Roman Zhuravlev of AXELOS, not the words of endless praise and elevation of ITIL, but the honest admission that things are not going the way they should.  The novel outlined that we live in a seriously ill market with many problems, and the community faces a task that is familiar with the wording but is fresh in content: make ITIL great again.

      Indeed, ITIL is an imperfect product released on 2000 pages 10 years ago and in some ways it is hopelessly outdated.  And the format of the 4-volume book itself is inconvenient for perception.  Moreover, even the certification scheme is complex and confusing, which makes it a commercially inefficient product.  And the users themselves had a hand in ITIL disease: <br><br><ul><li>  nurtured a cargo cult: if nothing helps, urgently implement ITIL or DevOps - oh, and they did not help, a complete disappointment, discard them; <br></li><li>  help coaches, reading in the dungeons of corporations beautiful slides about DevOps and ITIL with the words ‚Äúdigital transformation‚Äù on each; <br></li><li>  top managers also have not lagged behind, refusing to methodologies in the gradual implementation and long-term development, as their goal is monetary bonuses for the year in the short term. <br></li></ul><br>  So, it was decided to <s>cut the hell to</s> change ITIL. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4b2/ab8/623/4b2ab86233e95423b85e414c0fb0483d.png"><br>  <font color="#999999"><i>Roman Zhuravlyov knows what ITIL should be.</i></font>  <font color="#999999"><i>And we believe - so be it!</i></font> <br><br>  The community has a need to change ITIL and make the accumulated experience demanded by modern specialists.  In particular, it is proposed to share tips and strict rules, translate the library of best practices into electronic format, optimize the certification scheme.  They promise that the first data on the changes will come to the community in early 2018.  The winter is coming. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#20155e">Trends, however</font> </h2><br>  <a href="http://www.alloysoftware.ru/">We</a> were divided in order to visit as many reports as possible, and sometimes even went from one audience to another during performances.  And it turned out to be effective - we exchanged observations, put together theses and trends, and in the end we got a lot of interesting observations. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>Speaker quote</i> <i><br></i>  <i><b>‚ÄúAccountants are sad women, they have to sit with numbers all day‚Äù</b> .</i> </blockquote><br><ul><li>  Several times on the stands and in reports, the idea was voiced that ITSM-software should be pursuing, first of all, not for beautiful interfaces, but for functional content.  The system administrator and the network engineer are interested in the last step as to how the ticket and the design of the program are designed.  It is much more important that the windows allow you to work quickly with the data and be informative. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/36e/a37/b5f/36ea37b5f564cf6fbd51c826d307e158.jpg"><br>  <font color="#999999"><i>White and fluffy tech support</i></font> <br></li><li>  There should be end-to-end integration of services that are used in the company.  Without end-to-end integration, it will not be possible to do full automation.  But the words that it should be automated everything that has been done at least three times, sounded by many speakers and insiders <br></li><li>  The result of automation should be the establishment of a process as an object of management - a representative of Raiffeisenbank told about this in DevOps and Agile reports.  The report turned out to be impressive: somehow you do not expect such an inert structure as a bank of such flexible and advanced methodologies.  The speaker was categorical: "Everything that we do more than once, we automate."  One of the components of the bank‚Äôs success in this difficult endeavor has been lifelong learning: a few monitoring specialists are being introduced into teams, trained and returned to their work.  Thus, teams receive valuable knowledge and do not overload specialists. <br></li><li> All units should be interested in ITSM-projects.  If this does not happen, the IT department should work out the interactions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/12f/a74/a41/12fa74a410f4c2918251834ba3a99722.png"><br>  <font color="#999999"><i>Slide about sore - how IT for accounting to visit guests</i></font> <br></li><li>  By the way, about training and qualifications were mentioned almost in every report.  First of all, it was about the fact that specialists should have expert experience in many areas at once in order to substitute colleagues or cover complex processes in such institutions as, for example, banks.  There should be a mixture of competences - the specialists of the new time are in demand, who are able to work at the intersection of organizational structure, processes and technologies. <br></li><li>  In addition to hardware and software assets, another type is clearly delineated: IT systems.  These are combinations of the first two types, plus documentation and processes related to hardware and software. <br></li><li>  Incidents are normal, you should not be afraid of them, but you need to be able to draw conclusions and find root causes.  On the way of working with incidents, specialists have exactly two assistants: good software and analytics, which are assembled in it.  We are looking at our new <a href="http://www.alloysoftware.ru/products/alloy-navigator/">Alloy Navigator 8.0</a> and fully agree with this thesis. <br></li></ul><br><blockquote>  <i>Speaker quote</i> <i><br></i>  <i><b>‚ÄúI‚Äôll break my legs today so that I don‚Äôt go anywhere tomorrow</b> . <b>‚Äù</b></i> </blockquote><br><h2>  Almost valuable report from Sberbank </h2><br>  In each of the reports we visited, there was a maximum of practice, a minimum of theory and advertising.  But the report of the head of IT infrastructure monitoring at Sberbank-Technology, Sergey Prutskikh, turned out to be the most practically valuable, concise and cool.  He spoke about seven taboos when building a system for monitoring the IT infrastructure in the company and called them "seven NOT."  Let us dwell on the report in more detail, we will comment on each principle, since this is indeed a ‚Äútake and do‚Äù story. <br><br>  <b>Do NOT engage in the implementation of a monitoring system</b> - the system itself does not solve anything, it decides the organization of processes.  If you put the most sophisticated system, and the processes are not debugged, the result will be negative. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/046/a3d/770/046a3d7705ff15477b3daaef2971c1cf.png"><br>  <font color="#999999"><i>Spy Slide Title Sponsor - An Uncomfortable Place In The Depth Of The Hall</i></font> <br><br>  <b>The integrator will NOT do all the work for you.</b>  Perhaps this is the most exciting point of the seven of us - the fact is that business representatives often believe in the magic pill (the system itself) and in the smart uncle (vendor), which together should solve all the problems.  However, no one knows better than you all the nuances and problems of your IT infrastructure, which means that the success of the monitoring system largely depends on you. <br><br>  <b>DO NOT confuse monitoring and administration of IT infrastructure.</b>  Indeed, monitoring is a set of processes for monitoring the state of the infrastructure, and administration is the work of designing, creating, developing, updating, maintaining, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6e2/315/c91/6e2315c91b8cc33cf06795491aeb7556.png"><br><br>  <b>DO NOT expect that your subordinates will use monitoring if you do not consume the results of its work.</b>  If management has implemented monitoring as a formality, then employees will not treat it as an important work tool.  Be sure to keep your interest in the implemented project and the results of its work, especially since a properly configured and controlled monitoring system helps to save on costs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/93b/c65/678/93bc65678b4798535a5e22534c1e090a.png"><br><br>  <b>DO NOT force employees to work with the monitoring system</b> - motivate them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e3f/3eb/3c3/e3f3eb3c3de6c9276e77ae98d3e66f47.png"><br><br>  During testing, do <b>NOT concentrate on checking the functionality</b> of the monitoring system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/39c/ec5/7f1/39cec57f1366ea04ab3077f1e871f2f2.png"><br><br>  <b>Monitoring will NOT begin to bring benefits</b> until you start working with it and adapt it to your needs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/233/417/421/2334174210b0935d16823ba8e3b91a7c.png"><br>  <font color="#999999"><i>And the second sponsor of spy slides is a monitor-canon conflict</i></font> <br><br><h2>  <font color="#20155e">Why are we there?</font> </h2><br>  ‚ÄúOur team often takes part in various conferences related to ITSM topics,‚Äù we would like to write in this paragraph.  But it often does not work out - because there are only two large conferences in Russia (in spring and autumn), and there are not very many around the world.  However, we are going and going, with or without a stand (like this time).  Firstly, we make the <s>best in the world</s> IT management systems <a href="http://www.alloysoftware.ru/products/alloy-navigator/">Alloy Navigator</a> and <a href="http://www.alloysoftware.ru/products/alloy-discovery/">Alloy Discovery</a> and we are interested in telling and learning from the participants.  And secondly, our team is impressed that at these conferences there is no hunting of the competitors, no desire to live up to the banquet, but there is a constant exchange of experience and, as they say, its own atmosphere. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/344/918/f84/344918f8478c9730fb0598f113263ca0.png"><br><br><ol><li>  Almost all participants are ‚Äúon topic‚Äù: they are representatives of vendors, system administrators, economists (and this is important - an indicator that companies are learning how to properly manage IT infrastructure costs), developers, technical directors, customers, etc. <br></li><li>  ITSMF reports consist of insights, insiders, practices and secrets of skill.  Advertising in them is the minimum - usually advertising is placed on stands or in the form of section sponsorship.  But, of course, there are exceptions - not particularly offensive. <br></li><li>  At the conference you can meet completely unexpected and very high-ranking people, make acquaintance with them, try to lobby business interests. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f33/d80/e66/f33d80e66dea47f2087dcc1278637447.jpg"><br>  <font color="#999999"><i>The founder of the library ITIL, absolutely stunning DR.</i></font>  <font color="#999999"><i>DON PAGE, ITSM Strategic Director</i></font> </li><li>  All competitors represented on the stands communicate with each other, ask about updates, collect materials, learn from experience and are not afraid of this process. <br></li><li>  At the stands, you can look at the software in the work, ask the experts exactly the questions (we have nothing against the long-legged beauties on the stands, but this is not the situation) and even agree on cooperation and special terms of software acquisition. <br></li></ol><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/029/13c/27e/02913c27ebf459f5196219941caa52ea.jpg"><br>  <font color="#999999"><i>And we are a small part <a href="http://www.alloysoftware.ru/">of the Alloy Software team</a> delegated to ITSMF</i></font> <br><br>  In general, the conference at first glance seems too serious and abstruse, very different from those to whom programmers are used to.  But after spending a day there, you realize that time is not wasted, the hook from St. Petersburg to Moscow is fully justified, and every minute of being in the ITSMF space is a business minute.  No games, puzzles, puzzles - only ITSM-hardcore. <br><br>  Make ITSM, not fail. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dcb/4c9/0d2/dcb4c90d20258135dbe65f639118406c.jpg"><br>  <font color="#999999"><i>Here's a direct proof that ITSM is a cake, and what else!</i></font> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/341514/">https://habr.com/ru/post/341514/</a></p>
