  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"Money" areas for startups - We choose in which area a startup should be created, if its goal of creation is to make a profit</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This short article is inspired by the topic ‚ÄúGolden mountains to a startup, or do not live for free, even if it was called 'free'‚Äù, where the author writes that, despite the fact that many people visit his site, the profitability of this site is ‚ÄúMINUS $ 5.22 in a day". <br>  I divide all startups into two types - ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù - that is, those related to the ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù human life (all kinds of online games, bookmarking sites, online meeting sites, chat rooms, etc.) and ‚Äúreal "- those that are needed by a person in his real life. <br>  Of course, both types of startups are really needed, otherwise they would not exist.  But, in my opinion, those startups that are directly related to the real life of people, make it possible for their creators to earn much more money.  Although not all startups created for real life can generate income.  To do this, startups must be created in the ‚Äúmoney‚Äù sphere. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  These are the areas where money is spinning, i.e.  deals are made. <br>  Significantly increase the level of satisfaction of people from using a startup can be due to the fact that the startup will give these people the opportunity to earn.  In this case, people are ready not only to watch ads, but even give their money for using such a startup. <br>  To find such areas, you just need to look at what people in real life earn (in the widest sense). <br>  On the sale and resale (this is even in the first place!) Things - here you are, please <br>  <a href="http://ebay.com/">Ebay</a> and <a href="http://molotok.ru/">Molotok</a> are highly successful projects that profit far from advertising. <br>  Even the forums where people discuss topics about how to make money on ebay - and they make paid. <br>  You can also earn money on receiving gifts, although this is somewhat contrary to moral standards (I wrote this article before the <a href="http://darudar.org/">Darudar</a> website was announced, and wanted to say that, in my opinion, such a project would certainly be successful). <br>  Many earn on renting apartments and other real estate (there are many such sites, but I believe that it would be nice to make an auction site where owners could rent apartments at the maximum price and make the most money - for that, they would certainly also be ready pay. Or is it already done?). <br>  Some (first of all, train conductors, etc.) make extra money on delivering packages with an opportunity - here you have <a href="http://birdymail.ru/">Birdymail</a> ‚Äî a rather interesting site that allows everyone to earn money on their trip (and not just the train conductor) or order delivery of goods, say, from - for the border with the subsequent potentially profitable resale. <br>  And, of course, all kinds of freelancing - here people also pay money to earn more and you can see for yourself how successful such projects are. <br>  But many opportunities are not yet open to startups. <br>  For example, my neighbor, a young woman, opened something like a dining room in her apartment; people from neighboring offices come to her for dinner, for which she charges a small fee from them.  What is not an idea for a startup?  Perhaps many people would be able to prepare food for others (including delivery to the office), earning on it. <br>  What drives people in this case?  Of course, money.  People, especially those who are far from the Internet, have little willing to pay for the use of services that will not give them profit.  Conversely, people are willing to pay money for the opportunity to earn more. <br>  I think so :) <br>  PS Who can name more "monetary" areas, write in the comments.  It is very interesting to consider similar options. </div>
