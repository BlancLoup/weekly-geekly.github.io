  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About self-realization</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello habrovchane.  The content of the latest topics on Habr√©, led me to certain thoughts that I want to share with you.  These thoughts concern for the most part quite complex aspects of our life, which can be philosophical for a long time.  Nevertheless, in this article I present to you my thoughts about self-realization of a person, about the choice of a profession, about a routine. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Oddly enough, but all sorts of hobbies accompany a person throughout his life.  Our essence is somehow connected with work, with activity, with progressive movement.  Well, we can not otherwise!  Even Onegin, and he was tired of the endless balls and social life.  Although of course, there are exceptions: the subjects are ready to go with the flow, and long resigned to their fate. <br><br>  So, the question of self-realization is quite high among all the other moral values ‚Äã‚Äãof modern society.  It is very significant that women who fought for equal rights also defended their right to self-realization, to climb the career ladder, etc.

      What is it?  Self-realization is one of the reasons that justifies our existence.  Self-realized completely - it means that there will be something to remember in old age and set a good example for children, no - well, everything was in your hands, there is nothing to be sorry for yourself.  Professional self-realization is inextricably linked with the profession and professional goals, as well as how well and efficiently you go to them. <br><br><h2>  Who to be? </h2><br>  The choice of a future profession, even more likely a field of activity, very often arises in front of young specialists.  They say that work is most effective when you do what you like.  Hmm, then it would seem there is nothing easier!  One has only to make a hobby his work. <br><br>  Do not rush, in fact, everything is not as clear as you think.  A hobby is an activity you like to do in your free time, and notice that you never recycle when you do your hobby.  As soon as you get bored, you give up until better times, when free time and desire reappear.  In any lesson, there is one not very pleasant thing - a routine that often cannot be avoided.  But we'll talk about routine a little later. <br><br>  Below, I want to present a list of theses that I think most accurately reflect my thoughts on this topic.  I came to all this judging from my own experience, therefore in these thoughts there is a fair share of subjectivism;) <br><br>  <b>Set goals for yourself.</b>  Yes, exactly, a person without a goal is a person with no future.  In choosing a profession (path), do not proceed from the desire to do any work, but set yourself the goals that you want to achieve, analyze, choose the ways of their implementation. <br><br>  Do you like cooking and do you want to open a cafe by the sea?  Well, to stand for 12 hours at the bar or stove up to 40 years would not be the best way. <br><br>  <b>Do not deny the opportunity to work for someone.</b>  Stories about Bill Gates, or Steve Jobs, who at the age of 24 became a millionaire, warm everyone‚Äôs soul, but I‚Äôm in a hurry to disappoint you.  Such people as they - units, and only darlings of destiny can jump on a step of the engine in time.  If you think that you are one of them - you are too presumptuous.  Throw out your book on motivation (I would say that all this literature is a <b>person</b> on <b>staff</b> motivation, rather than an individual), you don‚Äôt need it :) If you are going to create a start-up, you need to grow in the industry, make acquaintances, learn the process for example, turnkey development and software product support, examine possible errors. <br><br>  <b>Think before you do.</b>  Yes, if you do not like to typeset HTML, do not typeset it, you will become an excellent developer without this skill.  Be selective about your activities, do not get down to business if it could not interest you.  How does your motivation book say more?  So you still haven't thrown her out?  ]: -&gt; <br><br>  <b>Choosing a job / scope, do not focus on money.</b>  Remember, if you come into the profession only for money (and IT specialists pay us very well), then with a high degree of probability, you are doomed to failure :) No, of course you will earn, but how much will you have?  And your nerves?  Without fan, especially in IT, there is nothing to do in the profession.  Time and health are more precious than any money! <br><br>  <b>Do not be afraid to change your goals.</b>  Man develops, changes.  Together with him, his needs and desires change, and ultimately his goals.  If your goal is no longer interesting to you - it does not matter, do not be afraid to change it, or even your occupation.  With hunger you, if anything, will not die (parents or friends will help), and you will always have time to return to the past lesson. <br><br>  <b>Do not be afraid to make a mistake.</b>  The most important thing that you lose is time, the rest is not worth it, so as not to try yourself in any business.  After all, in the end it is better to try and regret, than not to try and regret. <br><br>  <b>Set priorities.</b>  Do you have a lot of hobbies, like me?  Well, then prioritize.  Being a universal, and being able to do everything at once at the same time is not possible, because everything takes time, and to develop skills and abilities, too. <br><br><h2>  Routine </h2><br>  Even doing the most necessary and favorite thing, there may be a period when you are ready to send everyone and everyone away.  Yes, it is likely you are mired in a routine ... <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Evil IE Displays All Wrong? <br>  ‚Ä¢ Is design sprawling? <br>  ‚Ä¢ Attempts to optimize the time to perform operations with the database did not lead to success? <br>  ‚Ä¢ Do you have half a year of bug fixing at work? <br>  ‚Ä¢ The customer did not like the design, and he asked you to redo everything, and in full bad taste? <br><br>  If this is familiar to you, do not rush to throw away your favorite book on database design / design / etc.  This is a completely ordinary routine, which, of course, poisons our life, but cannot escape from it.  So, if you still have a desire to quickly end the obsessive occupation / project / employer / goal / idea / startup / etc., Read on! <br><br>  <b>Do not hurry.</b>  Trite, but maybe you need a break for a certain time.  If the deadlines are not tight, try to do something else: fix an old nasty bug, document a couple of files, update the wiki, drink coffee, read Habr :) Then go back to your task.  Sometimes you need to take such breaks several times, sometimes you need a long break.  However, at the same time ... <br><br>  <b>Do not be fooled.</b>  If you read Habr, more than you work, the deadlines for TASK have long been expired, the Internet attracts more than work, then most likely you need a change of scenery.  If the idea has outlived itself - drop it, find a new one.  The project as two months has ceased to interest you - ask the heads to transfer you to another.  Your work is not interesting to you and simply the prospects do not seduce - think about finding a new one.  Your brilliant startup has become a burden - put it off until better times. <br><br>  <b>Before you leave your favorite business / job / idea / profession (o_O) ...</b> Remember what led you to this.  For example, in design.  Read your first book about design, perhaps enthusiasm will wake up in you, and you will understand that you will not part with this for a very long time. <br><br><h2>  findings </h2><br>  And the conclusion can be only one - all in your hands.  Do not torment yourself with doubts, you just need to take and analyze, then everything will be more or less clear.  Sometimes impulsive decisions can be better, even than the most scrupulous analysis.  Sometimes flair, but not all possess it. <br><br>  And remember: in your attempts to self-realize - do not overwork, you also need to rest, and do not forget about your personal life;) <br><br>  <b>UPD.</b>  <b>Gentlemen minus the article and karma: you speak, speak.</b>  <b>If you are so smart, then you certainly have something to tell the habrovans;)</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/39139/">https://habr.com/ru/post/39139/</a></p>
