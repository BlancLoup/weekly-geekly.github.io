  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How chat bots help build omnichanal experience</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Almost every person who has a smartphone today has ever used a chat bot.  From the user's side, bots look like simple programs in instant messengers that can solve elementary tasks with the help of text messages.  For example, they will help you find and order a flight ticket or pick up the desired bow in an online store.  But what does all this look like from the other side of the barricades, how does business introduce chatbots into their work and what real benefits can they bring to it?  Is everything so simple? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Total digitalization and omni channel </h2><br>  Business is increasingly becoming <a href="http://www.forbes.ru/tehnologii/345871-chto-budet-s-cifrovymi-kanalami-cherez-5-let">customer-centric</a> , and digital transformation modifies business processes and approaches to customer service ‚Äî the emergence of new technologies allows the consumer and his expectations to determine the development of a company or brand. <br><br>  Omnichannel is one of the main components of business digitalization.  Have <br>  This concept has many definitions, but most accurately expresses its essence as follows: the seamless interaction of the brand with customers, allowing you to make a continuous customer path using different platforms.  With omni-channel all channels are integrated around the user.  A customer, making a customer journey, can safely switch between channels, and at the same time receive personalized service.  The main goal of omnicanality is to create a positive customer experience. <br><br>  According <a href="http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3072017">to</a> Gartner, by 2018, half of the companies will try to change the business model in such a way as to improve their user experience.  And by 2020, the user experience will overtake in its importance to the consumer the price and the quality of the product itself ( <a href="https://www.walkerinfo.com/customers2020/">Walker</a> ).

      Omnichannelism is the key to first-class customer experience, and, consequently, increasing business profitability.  According <a href="https://www.forbes.com/forbesinsights/sitecore/">to</a> Forbes, today organizations use an average of 35 (!) Different systems for data collection, which are practically not integrated with each other.  It turns out that most companies do not know how to identify a client and do not understand the mechanics of its customer journey through various digital channels. <br><br>  Modern users, especially millennials and the Z generation, are important in communicating with brands: <br><br><ol><li>  instant and adequate feedback </li><li>  high-quality customer service online </li><li>  seamless interaction (omni channel) </li><li>  clear and user-friendly interface, the ability to order and pay for a product or service in a couple of clicks. </li></ol><br>  Companies face a number of important tasks: to be able to identify and track the client‚Äôs path, form a pool of data about him and respond very quickly to user requests in any digital channels. <br><br>  There are several main barriers along the way: <br><br>  - companies can not work independently with Big Data <br>  - do not know how to identify the client.  The results of the Dimension Data study worldwide show that only 36% of organizations can track transitions between several channels. <br>  - do not understand how to automate the work of customer service <br><br>  According to <a href="https://econsultancy.com/blog/61991-83-of-online-shoppers-need-support-to-complete-a-purchase-stats">eConsultancy,</a> consumers prefer to receive support primarily through the three main channels: telephone, email and chat on the site.  Moreover, 61% of them cannot easily switch between channels when communicating with customer support ( <a href="http://blogs.aspect.com/infographic-omni-channel-service-doesnt-measure-up-customers-are-tired-of-playing-games/">Aspect</a> ).  The problem of automating customer service and customer support when changing channels almost 100% can be closed by chat bots. <br><br><h3>  Chat bots and omnicanality </h3><br>  Seamless communication of the brand with customers is realized through a pool of various technologies.  The use of bots helps to improve the efficiency of customer service, primarily through the routing and personalization of incoming calls. <br><br>  According to BI Intelligence, November 2016 chat bots can save up to 30% of resources, proportionally increasing the overall profitability of a business. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d6a/db6/5c4/d6adb65c404087cc6519178f960375c5.png" alt="image"><br><br>  By themselves, technologies lose their value for online users, high-quality and fast customer service comes first.  A modern client wants to get an answer to their questions here and now, quickly solve a problem, get timely help or advice.  In this case, the user can go to the company's website with at least 3-5 devices, and from several accounts from different social networks.  However, he expects that the dialogue with him will continue from the point where he finished it.  The request of the support service operators to repeat their requests several times causes only irritation. <br><br>  In order to remain effective, the business enhances customer support: companies use the services of outsourced contact centers (CC) or try to create their in-house, but the old scheme of working only with voice calls does not allow CC to be effective. <br><br>  Large business uses corporate CC for informational customer support.  The working day of ordinary employees is limited, while the need for help from the client may appear at any time, whether it is late evening or weekend.  Chat bots can provide customer support 24/7.  Accordingly, the need for bots will only grow. <br><br>  According to the analytical company iKS-Consulting, the average annual growth of the market for outsourced contact centers until 2020 will remain at 5.5%. <br><br>  And the second point - high-quality customer service is impossible today without the processing of text channels.  Text channels increase the share in the total volume of communications, and this sets the task for the business to be able to work with them effectively.  90% of modern consumers prefer to use instant messengers (according <a href="https://investors.twilio.com/news/all-news/press-release-details/2016/Twilio-Study-Finds-That-9-out-of-10-Consumers-Globally-Want-to-Message-With-Brands/default.aspx">to</a> Twilio) to communicate with companies.  This is one of the key points that chat bots developers are counting on - automating the work of processing simple initial calls.  For example, the introduction of YouDrive into the support service of the car sharing bot helped to ‚Öî reduce the number of calls to the company. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.mindshareworld.com/sites/default/files/MINDSHARE_HUDDLE_HUMANITY_MACHINE_2016_0.pdf">Most</a> modern consumers are not against the first contact with the business using chat bots.  To quickly get answers to your questions, many are ready to interact with chat bots.  According <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/Article/Chatbots-Akin-Real-Life-Customer-Service/1015022">to</a> emarketer, a third of all active Internet users already prefer to ask questions to companies in online chat rooms and instant messengers. <br>  The web assistant of Nina, a large Swedish bank, Swedbank leads up to 30,000 conversations in the messenger per month and can handle more than 350 different customer requests.  This level of service is what many companies are striving for. <br><br>  There are <a href="https://blog.marketo.com/2007/11/improving-lead.html">figures</a> according to which improving the quality of processing customer requests by 10% can increase sales efficiency by almost 2 times.  Using chat bots, you can improve the quality of customer support, while not making additional costs for the expansion of sales staff. <br><br>  There is one more thing that many prefer not to mention out loud - pseudo-homosexuality.  Very often, IT solution providers or marketers talk about the omnichannel approach and the introduction of seamless interaction in business processes.  In fact, the company or brand simply learned to work with several different channels of communication.  The client, communicating with the company, does not gain any seamless experience: when the client contacts the company‚Äôs manager, he doesn‚Äôt see what his colleagues in another channel were talking about with the client. <br><br>  For the development of the omnichannel approach, it is necessary that the management of the company have a clear vision of digital transformation, as well as an established strategy for working in digital and text channels. <br><br>  The results of the study Dimension Data worldwide show that only 17% are able to identify problem points of interaction in the path of the client.  For most companies, making a client transition map between all channels and analyzing problem points of customer experience is an impossible task.  Namely, these places are growth points for proactive digital communication with customers.  Smart chat bots in conjunction with artificial intelligence and Big Data help to implement proactive user interaction scenarios. <br><br><h2>  Where and in what business bots will be useful? </h2><br>  According to businesswire.com <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170202005441/en/Global-Chatbot-Market-Grow-CAGR-37-2021">research,</a> today the most promising industries for the use of bots are related to customer service.  First of all, it is banking, insurance and e-commerce, as well as booking tickets and tours. <br><br>  Chat bots make customer service more efficient by automating the routine - this is one of their strengths.  The more ‚Äúintelligent‚Äù chat bots, the greater the proportion of standard repetitive processes they are ready to take on.  Here are a couple of inspiring examples. <br><br>  In the H &amp; M mobile app, the chat bot asks the customer questions about their preferred clothing style.  Having collected the full information, the bot gives recommendations on things that best suit the tastes of the buyer. <br><br>  The startup <a href="http://helloava.co/">HelloAva</a> bot works as an expert who gives customers personalized recommendations for skin care. <br><br>  But an example of successful application of an advanced bot is <a href="https://kyivstar.ua/en/mm/zoriana">Zoryan's</a> smart chat bot.  It was introduced into its work by the Ukrainian telecom operator Kyivstar.  In Zoryana base, there are 12,000 standardized answers to customer questions, and the bot helps to solve 70% of incoming questions.  He works on the company's website, in its social networks and instant messengers, and he helps the operator‚Äôs call center.  The link to Zoryan is in the standard voice menu, if desired, the user can ask his questions to the bot: 25% of callers go from IVR to Zoryan.  And only 10% of these 25% then call back again to the CC.  This suggests that the bot copes with the solution of simple client requests, relieves living operators and takes the main routine of communicating with customers on themselves. <br><br>  According to forecasts by Market Research Future, the global chat bots market will grow by 37% by 2023 and reach a turnover of $ 6 billion.  The use of bots for effective communication with customers in digital channels is only gaining momentum and in the near future will open up broad prospects for businesses. <br><br>  Despite the bright prospects from the introduction of bots, which have been heavily heated by the media lately, there are a number of serious limitations in their use: <br><br><ul><li>  Business does not understand how to implement bots.  It does not have an established strategy for working in digital channels or a roadmap for digital transformation. </li><li>  The development of bots is divorced from business processes, and many IT vendors tend to raise hyip to increase the flow of hits. </li><li>  In the public sector, bots still do not know how to recognize voice quality and translate it into text.  There are very advanced solutions on the market, but their cost is still very high. </li><li>  There are practically no solutions on the market that can be easily integrated with third-party platforms.  Therefore, it is difficult to implement chat bots in business processes.  One of the pioneers of such solutions is LiveTex, which recently launched a communication API to the market, with which you can not only build a bot into the omnichannel service, but also collect statistics on all calls from all text channels and calculate the effect of their implementation. </li></ul><br><h2>  What is the bottom line? </h2><br>  Today, business is just experimenting with chat bots.  He uses them to optimize customer support services and automate routine activities.  For businesses, chat bots are all about operational efficiency and cost savings, as well as managing customer interactions.  Chat bots can be a competitive advantage that helps save time and money and increases customer loyalty. <br><br>  The forecasts say that the chat bots market will grow, and the use of artificial intelligence will make them much smarter and will greatly expand the functionality.  However, the magic pill does not happen.  Businesses will need to do a lot of work on the digitalization of all their processes, external and internal communications. <br><br>  Digital customer support is a promise of speed, efficiency and, to a large extent, a sense of control.  Chat bots are a great tool for this, with which you can create a true omnichannel customer experience.  However, it is important to understand how you can intelligently adapt bots to business processes and company structure. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/338656/">https://habr.com/ru/post/338656/</a></p>
