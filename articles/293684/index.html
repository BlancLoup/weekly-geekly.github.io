I present to you a list of nine people who are among the most active and respected LinkedIn users in the technology industry. <br><br>  LinkedIn commissioned by <a href="http://www.cio.com/">CIO</a> recently combed its user base to identify the most active and influential users working in the IT industry.  Since it would be possible to make a list of the entire database that goes well beyond a thousand participants, it was decided to limit it to the regularity of posts, native English and the consent of the participant.  Thus the list was formed.  In general, all lists have their advantages, although many do not really like them.  For example, I often get lucky and I find in the lists various interesting characters that are just not to be found.  Well, let's get started. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/013/18e/b33/01318eb33232471b82e3755a8e2e22c1.png" alt="Naomi simson" align="left"><h4>  Naomi Simson (Naomi Simson) </h4><br>  Founder and Director, <a href="https://www.redballoon.com.au/">RedBalloon</a> <br>  877973 subscribers <br><br>  <a href="https://au.linkedin.com/in/naomisimson">Naomi Simson</a> ‚Äôs career began with marketing at the Australian branch of Apple Computer in the early 1990s.  Since 2001, she began to work for herself, having established the RedBalloon company in which she now holds a leading position.  She wrote three books, participated in the Australian version <i>of Shark Tank</i> , as one of the investors, and also published about 1000 posts over the past ten years.
