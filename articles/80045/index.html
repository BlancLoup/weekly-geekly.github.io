      The Lyceum presents two sides of freelancers <br>  - ‚ÄúTeachers‚Äù - those who publish their lessons <br>  - ‚ÄúStudents‚Äù - those who acquire them <br><br>  Instructors add lessons, and charge a price for them.  After all, really useful and unique information should have its price.  The most promising "teachers" will take a professional interview.  "Teachers" in our high school are respected and many privileges. <br>  Imagine that you, a freelancer, want to learn something concrete or fundamentally new.  And here you find a lesson, a wonderful, concrete, paid lesson.  And he is so good that you want to buy it.  After all, he will solve all your problems of finding something new and necessary according to your specialization and in the future will give you a significant advantage.  Or on the contrary, you are an excellent specialist in your field and want to share your experience - you have the opportunity to earn money this way! <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  This lyceum, lyceum freelance art, where you can find detailed unique lessons aimed at solving specific creative problems.  What is a lyceum?  This is an educational institution, the main task of which is specialized preparation for entering universities.  So it is with us!  Here you receive specialized assistance in the area in which you are acquiring a lesson.  And ‚Äúenter‚Äù to a higher level of your professional development. <br><br>  But do not forget that a thorough check is made on plagiarism lessons, and in such an unfortunate case, measures are taken against the ‚Äúhack‚Äù.  Too simple and theoretical lessons will also be difficult to post - because they do not solve specific problems.  In our high school all the lessons are focused exclusively on the result!  No water and nothing more!  The lessons are exactly what they should be - detailed and carrying maximum useful information.  You will not find such information anywhere for free! <br><br>  Our goal is to show what good lessons are, to cultivate the taste of beginning specialists and, of course, to raise the level of freelancers to the proper height. <br><br>  By putting your lessons up for sale, you raise the professional level of not only freelancers who acquire your knowledge, but also their level.  The level of professionalism, competence and, which is for sure, one of the most pleasant, the level of material wealth.  Teaching, it turns out, is beneficial! <br><br>  Surely many, going out on the ‚Äúfreelance path‚Äù, did not have much experience behind them, did not know many necessary and useful things.  And only then, over time, with stuffed cones, they gained experience, got cut, like gems, developed their own style, some of their own achievements.  Shoveled forums, directories, questionnaires, respondents in search of answers to questions, in search of more or less suitable solutions, techniques, techniques, tools.  And surely many would like them to have a wise and experienced teacher who would suggest that yes how, help avoid mistakes, improve skills, etc., etc. <br>  Actually, from these freelance realities, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Lyceum has grown - a service that allows you to share knowledge between freelancers.  Naturally, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãknowledge transfer is not new, however, each implementation of any idea may be interesting in its own way. <br>  What do we have in the Lyceum?  The meeting place of ‚Äúfierce youths‚Äù, eager for knowledge and experienced freelance ‚Äúbison‚Äù, who are already unable to find interesting tasks - because they have remade so much in their lives, they have written / drawn / impressed / advanced so much that now they would lie on the stove, yes youth lecture.  And so, please.  Want to learn?  Prepare a lesson, place, and receive money.  Experience is a valuable thing, so there are those who want to pay for useful lessons.  Want to study?  Welcome.  The system as in an RPG - got a loot - pumped up skills.  Or as in NFS - won the race, earned some money - pumped the car. <br>  Wait, some will argue, but who wants to share their knowledge, thereby strengthening their own competitors in the freelancing market?  Those I answer, who no longer want to work with pens.  Those who like to learn and share knowledge.  Those who, in fact, have something to share.  Of course, if a coder wants to carry his own method of implementing a stretching block with a png-shadow in ... well, anywhere is his decision.  But it would be much more useful for his wallet to offer this method to people for money.  In addition, I believe it is also useful to share knowledge because when you try to explain something to another person, you yourself better understand the essence of the matter.  It is for this reason that students are forced to prepare reports, etc., etc.  How students do this is a completely separate story. <br>  Wait, others will argue, but who will buy these lessons, and if so is the sea of ‚Äã‚Äãany information in the internet - and all for free.  And I will answer you - those who value their time.  Because the lessons at the Lyceum are checked: firstly, for plagiarism, secondly, for quality - so that there is no ‚Äúwater‚Äù, so that everything is essentially.  As for me, it is better to pay a small amount for the ‚Äúknowledge extract‚Äù than to shovel 10 forum threads of 20 pages each, in search of a single line of code that solves your problem in the next script.  I think there will be like-minded people on this issue. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/80045/">https://habr.com/ru/post/80045/</a></p>
