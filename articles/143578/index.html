      Let's see how we pleased this time. <br><br>  Plodding through the skillfully piled up heaps of third-rate figures and letters that are completely meaningless, let us summarize the statistics of the current situation into a short summary sign with a minimum of explanatory words. <br><br>  ============================================= <br><br>  <u>INVENTIONS</u> <br><br>  Applications submitted by the Russian Federation (2011% by 2010) <br>  - Russian applicants 26.495 <u>92%</u> <b>-8%</b> <br>  - foreign applicants 14.919 <u>108%</u> <b>+ 8%</b> <br>  (Russian-foreign gap: <u><b>-16%</b></u> ) <br><br>  Withdrawn applications (2011% by 2010) <br>  - to Russian applicants 5.161 <u>124%</u> <b>+ 24%</b> <br>  - to foreign applicants 3.526 <u>89.6%</u> <b>-10%</b> <br>  (Russian / foreign gap: <u><b>-34%</b></u> ) <br><br>  Issued patents of the Russian Federation (2011% by 2010) <br>  - to Russian applicants 20.339 <u>94%</u> <b>-6%</b> <br>  - to foreign applicants 9.660 <u>111%</u> <b>+ 11%</b> <br>  (Russian-foreign gap: <u><b>-17%</b></u> ) <br><br>  <u>INDUSTRIAL SAMPLES</u> <br><br>  Applications submitted by the Russian Federation (2011% by 2010) <br>  - from Russian applicants 1.913 <u>96.6%</u> <b>-3.4%</b> <br>  - from foreign applicants 2.284 <u>113.3%</u> <b>+ 13.3%</b> <br>  (Russian / foreign gap: <u><b>-16.7%</b></u> ) <br><br>  Issued patents of the Russian Federation (2011% by 2010) <br>  - to Russian applicants 1.622 <u>93%</u> <b>-7%</b> <br>  - to foreign applicants 1.867 <u>102%</u> <b>+ 2%</b> <br>  (Russian-foreign gap: <u><b>-9%</b></u> ) <br><br>  <u><b>- The number of valid patents of the Russian Federation</b></u> <br><br>  <u>INVENTIONS:</u> <br>  Effective 31.12.2010 181.904 <br>  Effective 31.12.2011 168.558 <br>  (2010/2011 change: <u><b>-7.3%</b></u> ) <br><br>  <u>INDUSTRIAL SAMPLES:</u> <br>  Effective 31.12.2010 22.946 <br>  Effective 31.12.2011 21.295 <br>  (2010/2011 change: <u><b>-7.2%</b></u> ) <br><br>  <u>UTILITY MODELS:</u> <br>  Effective 31.12.2010 54.848 <br>  Effective 31.12.2011 46.876 <br>  (2010/2011 change: <u><b>-14.5%</b></u> ) <br><br>  ============================================= <br><br>  This is not for all the <i>"damned 90s"</i> , but for only one, and not the worst year yet! <br>  Comments on this apparently unnecessary, but here are some sad and not politically correct thoughts from viewing appear. <br><br>  Any technology company is its development. <br>  This is all the more true for startups who have nothing else to do except development. <br>  And any technological developments are patents. <br>  No patents - no money, and if there is no money - there will be no company. <br>  The above statistics clearly shows that foreign companies understand this perfectly, and very quickly expand their share of the Russian patent ‚Äúpie‚Äù, not to mention the international pie, where there are practically no Russian developers and start-ups. <br>  In fact, the figure cited above is cunning, since foreign applicants from savings almost always <i>‚Äúpack‚Äù</i> in one application and, accordingly, a patent of the Russian Federation several original foreign ones, but the available figures must act soberly. <br><br>  Why are Russian developers and start-ups, in particular, working in the IT-industry, which is almost the only one still competitive in the foreign market, so scornfully treat such a serious issue as patent protection for developments? <br>  Moreover, it is doubly dismissive, given the enormous patent preferences they have over their counterparts from the United States, where such preferences and opportunities cannot be dreamed of. <br><br>  And here it is necessary to express some politically incorrect and unpopular considerations. <br><br>  One gets a steady impression that in the Russian Federation in general, and in the IT industry - especially, because of some misunderstanding that arose, and by an even greater misunderstanding, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äúshame‚Äù and ‚Äúindecency‚Äù of patents in general and IT-patents in particular is actively spread. <br>  In the USSR, "there was no" sex, and in the IT industry of the Russian Federation - "no" patents. <br>  And not just <i>‚Äúno‚Äù</i> , but <i>‚Äúno and not necessary!‚Äù</i> . <br>  It is enough to quickly run through Russian and wider, Russian-language online IT forums to form a strong opinion about the ‚Äúshame‚Äù and indecency of raising the issue itself, as if it were some kind of involuntary public defecation. <br><br>  In the overwhelming majority of Russian-language network IT forums, any appearing materials and even just messages on patent topics are immediately accompanied by comments about ‚Äúpatent trolling‚Äù, about ‚ÄúDown with patents‚Äù, etc., which immediately translates the question from be a serious and informative discussion, a shameful and indecent "joke". <br>  No one has even stuttered at the numerous start-ups lately. <br>  The question is quickly derived from the mass discussion and as a result of awareness. <br>  <i>‚ÄúThe topic is not interesting, forget it.‚Äù</i> <br>  The speed and efficiency of the ‚Äúcleansing‚Äù of the information space from this ‚Äúshameful‚Äù and ‚Äúuninteresting‚Äù topic is a matter of deserved respect, the master's hand is felt. <br>  At the same time, without any discussions and discussions, the patent field of the Russian Federation itself is being silently and quickly seized! <br>  The machine - works like a clock, around the clock, and without a glitch. <br><br>  Moreover, when a foreign guru visits a local community directly asking questions about the possibility of protecting start-up developments through patent mechanisms, the gurus roll their eyes coyly, blush with their pictures, showing that such questions are not asked in a decent society, and that the only way to protect a startup‚Äôs development is to <i>‚Äúdevelop faster than its competitors</i> . <i>‚Äù</i> <br>  But, first of all, this is frank nonsense; not a single startup can simply outrun large players already operating in the market, who are able to instantly throw people and resources on a new and promising topic that none of the startups have. <br>  And secondly, even from the few all the same, breaking through the dense information blockade of reports on patent battles of the largest world companies, one can guess that the matter is not quite clear, if you go through English-speaking forums, then guesses and suspicions will be replaced by a clear understanding of a sad reality. <br>  In the context of globalization of markets and businesses, patents are becoming the main and absolute weapon of technology companies to destroy or at least weaken competitors. <br>  However, in the Russian Federation all the talk about these weapons - cause only laughter. <br>  This is ridiculous and generally indecent - forget it. <br>  The invisible border of change of the sign of attitude to patents is quite simple to detect. <br>  Shame and indecency - extend exclusively to the development of Russian start-ups, but it is only for a Russian specialist to get a job in a foreign company, or even its Russian branch, and oh, a miracle! The shameful and indecent turns into right and needed. <br>  And not just claimed, but strictly obligatory, in all foreign companies jokes about the harmfulness of patenting new developments are treated quickly and very tough. <br>  The engineers of the Russian R &amp; D departments of Intels, Boeing, Microsoft and other Samsung lie - they won't let you. <br><br>  AFTERWARD <br><br>  The well-known A. Chubais said that in the modern world, high technologies do not sell, they are stolen and killed for them. <br>  In what, in what, and in it it is possible to believe in the head of RUSNANO. <br>  The players of the world technology market have never differed in excessive vegetarianism, and the growing competition due to the global crisis certainly leaves no such hope. <br>  <i>"Nothing personal just business"</i> <br>  And in these difficult conditions, the Russian IT industry has <i>‚Äúproblems‚Äù</i> . <br>  ... <br><br>  Ps.  Here, colleagues suggest that it seems that funny little people in funny caps - trampled and in the field of Russian pharma. <br>  Talk about patents there - also cause laughter and slogans <i>‚ÄúDown with farm patents!‚Äù</i> , <i>‚ÄúLet's not let us grow rich in our health!‚Äù</i> , <i>‚Äú</i> <i>Give</i> <i>everyone free medicines!‚Äù</i> . <br>  (It will be fun to see the reaction to these slogans not in the Russian Federation, but in the USA, Germany, Switzerland or Japan) <br>  But this is not our branch, let the farm itself get out and pours powder from cockroaches, rats and trolls. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143578/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143578/</a></p>
