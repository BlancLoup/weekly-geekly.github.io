  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Chinese in Russia, Russians in China</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Last time we told how we opened an office in Moscow.  Now we are sharing how Chinese employees work and work in Russia, and Russian workers in China.  How to settle down in the office, to find a common language in the negotiations and food in the store, what we think about each other - read about it in the article. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Working culture in china</b> <br>  In the life of Chinese and Russian specialists there is at least one common trait: they both stay up late at work.  There is a lot of work, leaving the office before the authorities are not accepted.  They don't spend the night in offices, as sometimes happens in neighboring Korea and Japan, but staying at work until 9 pm is common. <br><br>  Both in the office and in the country a leisurely rhythm of life - there is no Moscow rush and haste, this is noticeable from the first day of work in the Chinese office.  After lunch for an hour the whole office goes silent: the employees are sleeping.  And they do not just lean back in the chair, but place personal folding beds in the aisles.  The lights on the lunch break are turned off, sleep is comfortable.  At first it seems unusual, but then I remember the phrase ‚Äúhave eaten - you can both sleep‚Äù and stop paying attention to it. <br><br>  After the break, employees wake up with pleasant music or a company anthem.  It becomes noisy in the office again: the Chinese are talking quite loudly and it is difficult to find a quiet place.  Despite this, colleagues prefer to deal with urgent matters in a chat, even if they sit at adjacent tables.  Meetings discuss more serious issues.  It‚Äôs easier for us to come up and ask in person - this is where the differences in communication begin.

      <b>Differences in discussing problems</b> <br>  When discussing problems, Chinese colleagues need a special approach.  Our Russian straightforwardness here only hinders.  It seems to the Chinese that we are too persistent and impatient, but it seems to us that they do not listen to ideas or misunderstand them.  Therefore, it is widely believed that the Chinese tend to listen, and the Russians speak. <br><br><ul><li>  Maggie, Project Manager: The fact is that we are paying a lot of attention to the background of the problem - what was with it, what could be the reason.  Whereas in Russia people are fairly straightforward and immediately seek a solution. </li><li>  Sean, product manager: In China, we also argue when discussing ideas.  If we do not come to an agreement, we appoint repeated meetings, we make compromises - in any case, we take steps towards each other.  But it can be difficult to work with Russians: they don‚Äôt like to agree with the opinions of others and hardly make contact. </li><li>  Ekaterina, International Development Manager: When the discussion comes to a standstill, it always seems that that side does not listen and does not go forward.  It is important to understand the reasons.  For example, in China, the case may be in a rigid hierarchy: the word of the parent is law, and decisions are rarely disputed.  Also here they do not like to take risks and will rather go along the beaten track than experiment and come up with something new. </li><li>  Sean: When we can't agree, statistics come to the rescue.  Figures and facts are not wrong.  If there is a proposal, but we are not sure of its success - we conduct beta testing and evaluate the result.  The language of numbers is understood by all. </li></ul><br>  There is another reason that makes it difficult to get your ideas across - competition.  In Chinese companies, competition between employees is stronger than in Russia.  The population is large, many seek with large cities and large companies.  According to colleagues, from childhood they have to tacitly compete with each other.  There is a clear boundary between workers and personal relationships: you can be friends, but at work, every man for himself. <br><br>  Let's go to the Moscow office.  This is what Max, a developer from China, thinks about working in Russia: ‚ÄúThe IT environment is developing more intensively in Moscow.  You have a lot of good technical specialists, a lot of startups, events, conferences.  I like the fact that I have Russian expert friends: we discuss problems together and share experiences. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c53/144/d35/c53144d359814024a21182118e743bd9.jpg"><br><br>  Our office in Moscow has just opened, and apart from the time difference and the absence of an afternoon nap there are almost no differences in work.  All difficulties await Chinese colleagues outside the office. <br><br>  <b>Difficulties in life</b> <br>  The main problems of our colleagues in Russia and China are due to ignorance of the language.  In Moscow, residential areas of street names are written in Russian, passers-by in English almost do not speak.  Difficult to use urban transport. <br><br><ul><li>  Eva, business development manager: On a business trip in Moscow, we confused buses with trolley buses and trams: we only have buses that go.  Before leaving the house they always checked the route, but they were all the same wrong. </li><li>  Maggie: I once got lost on the street.  I still didn‚Äôt know how to use the subway, I forgot the address of the apartment.  She somehow remembered the place and in English asked passers-by how to get there.  People were responsive, but they spoke English poorly and I had to ask ten people before I got to the right place. </li></ul><br>  Even minor differences in familiar things can lead to serious problems.  So, in China, ATMs will first give out money, and then return the card.  In Russia, there are different ATMs.  Eve was not lucky - the ATM first issued a card.  Eva left, and 20 thousand rubles remained to lie in the ATM.  True, not for long. <br><br>  In addition to language, Russian employees in China found it difficult to get used to a different climate.  Guangzhou is located in the south of China.  In the summer it is hot and humid - things do not dry up, mold and cockroaches appear.  In winter, the rooms are colder than outside, as there is no central heating system.  The air is also different: an unknowing person will take a haze over buildings beyond the fog, which actually turns out to be smog.  The air here is dirtier than in Moscow - mostly more dust. <br><br>  Chinese and Russian cuisine are very different, and it is difficult to completely switch to local food.  Colleagues from China took with them sauces and spices, often prepared themselves.  Russian employees found familiar food in Russian and Arab shops.  Conveniently, both in Guangzhou and in Moscow there are restaurants of Chinese and European cuisine. <br><br><ul><li>  Diana, marketing manager: In the store, you often don‚Äôt know what to take - everything is in Chinese, and you have to choose packaging.  I developed a method: I take something that costs little on the shelf.  After all, there are few goods in two cases: either it is popular (and bought out), or not (and the layout is not replenished).  Usually the method works, and I come across a normal meal. </li><li>  Sean: I will say: I am not happy with some Russian food.  Soup with potatoes, potato patties, baked potatoes, mashed potatoes - one potato!  In Russia, there are delicious dishes - those where there are no potatoes. </li><li>  Maggie: Both Chinese and Russian cuisine have similar dishes.  In addition, loved ones can always cook yourself. </li></ul><br>  <b>Chinese and Russians about each other</b> <br>  For sweetness, we asked Chinese and Russian collaborators to share their impressions of the country and people. <br><br><ul><li>  Catherine: It seems to me that Russians in China are generally well treated.  Once I was in a taxi.  The driver realized that I was from Russia, and set me the song ‚ÄúMoscow Nights‚Äù - they remember it from Soviet times.  He even sang along there a little while we were driving. </li><li>  Diane: I used to walk fast, and when I first came to Guangzhou, I was confronted with the fact that people here are not in a hurry.  Relaxed walk through the streets, in shops and subways.  It was unusual to change the pace, but I liked it. </li><li>  Maggie: I liked Moscow.  A beautiful city with a long history.  Clean and deep metro.  Only the prices are quite high.  Russian people are brave and strong, kind and hospitable.  But stubborn and often interrupted. </li><li>  Sean: The first thing that comes to mind is everything you have.  Big country, large windows and rooms, spacious streets.  Still nature is beautiful.  Just do not understand where so much dust on the streets?  The cars are dirty, and there is slush on the roads. </li><li>  Eva: Some Russians seem cold.  No one will talk to you when you stand at the bus stop and wait for the bus.  But generally responsive: the questions will be answered, with what they need help.  I remember, I went to ride a snowboard.  I did not do well, but a few people approached me and showed me how to do it right.  Was cool. </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f81/fe8/31f/f81fe831f77846f29a2a2d75171f1b28.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/366641/">https://habr.com/ru/post/366641/</a></p>
