I myself am a Frontend, and I believe that everyone should do their own thing.  In all sorts of disputes, I cite the following argument: <br><br><blockquote>  If you have a toothache, you turn to a dentist or run to a neighbor with the request ‚ÄúVasya, and Vasya, there's a tooth, third from the left, knock it out with a chisel, please, or else it hurts a lot‚Äù? </blockquote><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  That's right, the answer is obvious.  So why in relation to a web development at people such nonobvious attitude develops?  Why does any kid who has sat for a couple of days behind Dreamweaver already consider himself a webmaster?  Why does Uncle Vasya from Muhosranska, who stings spoons, having listened to his son's hints, opens his ‚Äúwebsite‚Äù, and his neighbor from the third floor, Uncle Kohl, goes to the agency and pays a lot of money for developing a website with carpentry services?

      Many will say that it is good, they say give the person a tool, and he will generate content and write websites on his knee in half an hour.  Maybe this is good, but such ‚Äúcontent‚Äù is not moderated by anyone, for the most part is not read by anyone and in the bottom line is nothing. <br><br>  In fact, it is a blockage of the Web, in which there are already more than 170,000,000 sites (and maybe more), of which a third, if not a quarter, is useful. <br><br>  There are many reasons, I do not dare to go into deep analytics, but some of them are on the surface. <br><br>  <strong>Part of the blame lies with the web developers themselves.</strong>  Every day a service appears that allows you to ‚Äúcreate your website in 5 minutes‚Äù, tell ‚Äúabout all design secrets in 10 minutes‚Äù or something else will allow you to ‚Äútake‚Äù the design of any website you like and make it your website.  You just write, write.  And all will be well.  And who makes these sites? ... That's right. <br><br>  <strong>The Internet, for the most part, has not grown to be a serious tool.</strong>  Here you can argue for a long time, but the facts remain facts.  On par with the development of web services and applications that are good and useful, site and blog generators are growing and multiplying, which very rarely are filled with high-quality content.  There are not so many professional web journalists, and there are a lot of violent graphomania (like me :)). <br><br>  <strong>Social networks</strong> that are not united by any common feature, quickly turn into a landfill, in which to find something useful is very difficult.  Not for nothing for quite some time, more or less serious bloggers switched to stand-alone blogs. <br><br>  <strong>The feeling of permissiveness and the atmosphere of the game.</strong>  Almost everyone who gets to the Network for the first time feels this.  For some, this feeling passes, for some it remains.  The second ones simply do not have thoughts like ‚Äúis it necessary?‚Äù Or ‚Äúcan a knowledgeable person be asked?‚Äù Because ‚Äúthis is the Internet, everything is possible here‚Äù.  Accordingly, you can also rivet pages, you can write mura, you can ‚Äúdraw‚Äù a site in an online designer in half an hour. <br><br>  <strong>As a result, the dump.</strong>  Search engines enthusiastically dig in it, giving out the mountain found, most average users can not find what they need, so the optimizer profession appeared (no offense to anyone).  Therefore, many developers write non-valid code, they say, and so it will come down, the user shavaet, many designers create as they like, and not as much as users need. <br><br>  Someone is satisfied with this state of affairs, I do not.  I want to make the Web better, I want to see the Internet with something really good and make websites so that it is not a shame to show them to anyone. <br><br>  <strong>ZY</strong>  And of course, not everything is as bad as it may seem to you after reading this scribbling.  Just need to "respect the work of a cleaner" :) <br><br>  What is your opinion on this issue, habra people? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/13424/">https://habr.com/ru/post/13424/</a></p>
