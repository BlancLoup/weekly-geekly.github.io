      <b>This is his majesty content</b> .  Typically, text (you can and video, but he has two drawbacks - not indexed and difficult to view "diagonally" as text). <br><br>  I will not write a long guide to working with content, but I will give three tips.  They are short, but cost me a lot of nerves and lost time.  I hope that they will help someone to save at least some of these irreplaceable resources. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Do not believe</b> what the PR experts say.  Paradoxically. <br><blockquote>  The fact is that the experience of experts (in quotes and without) could well become outdated in our rapidly changing world.  It was obtained in other conditions, in companies of a different size and businesses of a different type. </blockquote><br>  For example, I was told: <br><ul><li>  <i>Writing texts independently is stupid, readers recognize a non-professional and the audience leaves.</i>  Alas, but many texts that for us were written by professionals looked stereotypical, flat, ‚Äúwithout a spark‚Äù.  They don't care.  They do not root for the product, they do their job.  And the result is important to me ... </li><li>  <i>Writing on Megamind is dangerous.</i>  <i>The audience will ‚Äúscore‚Äù you.</i>  At first, the truth was beaten.  But not as much as scared.  But over time, we with the audience of the blog (with you, friends) reached a certain understanding.  I openly wrote about the experience of the development of the company and the product, you criticized - but in the case. </li><li>  <i>PR is not equal to sale.</i>  <i>Do not wait for the flow of interest after the publication.</i>  Probably for some businesses it is.  But this is what happened with us in the market of monitoring systems.  Someone read the article, found out that, in principle, there is a system that can show what its employees are doing right now and what they were doing than back / yesterday.  People said - "we did not know that this happens."  And then there were sales ... </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Do not be afraid to</b> experiment.  The first 50 failures in no case should discourage the desire to create content and persistently promote it. <br>  You will not be read.  You will write bad reviews (it is better, at least read and give feedback).  Network media will render you in the publication. <br><blockquote>  Do not despair. <br>  Time after time your lyrics will get better, you will learn to feel the audience and its requests.  You will become more and more interesting to each other. </blockquote><br><br>  <b>Do not ask</b> each online publication to publish an article about your company.  Imagine yourself in the place of the readers of this media - if the heading of a different company were in your head, would you be interested to read this article? <br>  Each parent, his child seems the most beautiful in the world.  It seems to every company founder that the whole world is just waiting for the opportunity to read about what functionality it has added to the product. <br><blockquote>  Start with a blog on your company website.  Then start publishing articles on various second-tier online resources.  And analyze, analyze. <br>  When you see a positive dynamic - create a blog on megamind and keep writing. </blockquote><br><br>  And one day, the federal media will suddenly turn to you and ask for a comment :) <br><br>  In general, try, fill your bumps, find original steps, achieve success. <br>  Good luck to you! <br><br>  Andrey Ignatov </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298630/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298630/</a></p>
