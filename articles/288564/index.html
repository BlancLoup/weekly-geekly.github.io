Playblog</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <a href="http://crazyhamster.livejournal.com/191484.html">crazyhamster.livejournal.com/191484.html</a> <br><br>  <b>Now with strawberry flavor</b> <br><br>  Something I do not like the last review.  All in press releases, like a Christmas tree in toys, sparkles with lures and advertising slogans.  Here it is - popularity.  Blogs have ceased to be exotic even for our country.  And remember how skepticism and irony sounded like an indiscreet chorus on the forum of your favorite newspaper a year and a half ago?  Although, frankly, I miss those times.  It is much more pleasant to prove to skeptics on the forum that they are wrong than to insert a press release from another mega-portal that drew attention to blogs to the review.  And before the blogs got politicians.  In general, the story is trivially repeated once again in a circle - blogs are just another means of attracting the attention of population, the first enthusiastic altruists go into the shadows, and entrepreneurs are advancing in the vanguard.  On average, in a week I get three or four press releases about the opening of new services or blogs, as well as five or seven letters asking ‚ÄúHow can I get my blog to your review?‚Äù And I don‚Äôt know what to do with it a wonderful phenomenon of nature.  If we skip absolutely everything on the air, then at the output we will receive an informative, but absolutely dry text that will be completely identical to the news feeds of some morning.ru.  Blogs are crammed into a specific form, which is limited to RSS, AdSence and the number of comments.  Reading the new posts in your favorite blogs, you are already starting to feel physically how the author counted the number of comments and how many positions the blog will rise in the Yandex rating.  Do you understand, yes?  I again lead to the fact that money is evil.  Blogs are becoming a commercially viable enterprise and bloggers are striving so much that readers will not become less.  What is the result?  Do blogs spoil people?  Replacing new and fresh thoughts with stimuli for the pleasure center.  Podcasting, youtube and Flickr have done their dirty deed - placing media content has become an elementary matter, and now, for example, you can post funny FOREIGN video clips and readers to your blog every day.  The text and originality go into the background, giving way to "chewing gum for the eyes."  The slogan of the last time: ‚ÄúNot asil!  Too many books! ‚ÄùTherefore, it‚Äôs ridiculous to read cries about the domination of pop music on radio, TV series and bed reading on book raids.  You, yes, yes, it is you who create less and less, replacing the present with substitutes for the present.  Instead of your review, you copy someone else's;  instead of your photo, give a link to another author;  instead, even if it‚Äôs very simple, but you‚Äôve passed the ‚ÄúWho are you in the Futurama world?‚Äù test of your story about how you got nasty in the store. Imagine, the matrix has us again.  Once upon a time Alexey Kruchenykh composed a wonderful verse ‚ÄúAt midnight I noticed ...‚Äù, which ends with the lines: ‚Äú- Burned? - No, I shot myself ...‚Äù And so we, in the blogs, learned something better.  And now to the gray weekdays. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>27 naked women</strong>

      Again, back to the HF forum.  Oh, I remember that angry response from readers when last year‚Äôs review published a link to an entry in one of the blogs that featured a colorful story from office life.  The secretary did not know how to do blowjob (this word was first used on the pages of her favorite newspaper).  In an amicable way, of course, I must now give a link to that topic so that you can read both the note and the comments, but it‚Äôs not worth it.  Battle of Khaletsky vs.  hypocrisy cannot be won or lost by either side.  It's time to strike again.  This time I will write about anal sex.  Well, well, I‚Äôm still not going to, but Sveta <a href="http://azbukivedi.livejournal.com/147523.html">has already written</a> : " <em>A year ago, I conducted a whole study of sex through the Internet." In particular, I was interested in what men are looking for, why, why. I went dating sites (sex dating, we clarify), read profiles to ringing in the ears and glare in his eyes, with many many men corresponded and a lot of forums shoveled. And I tell you with the last bluntness - there is no other kind of sex where supply and demand spread</em> . "  I am deeply convinced that this text should be in the biology textbook for the eighth grade, and then also for the tenth, in order to be firmly stored in the memory.  But for some reason he is in the blog of some Sveta, and a link to it is given in the newspaper about computers.  Do not you think that all this is through the very place about which the note? <br><br>  I continue to carry the sexual revolution to the masses.  Wonderful text titled " <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/ru_antireligion/955000.html">Sex: Test for sanity</a> ."  I warn you beforehand that not only propaganda of unbridled and animal sex, but also manifestations of religious intolerance are not only linked.  "The <em>regular beatings that children are subjected to in the system of" traditional moral education "and street crimes of sexual maniacs (brutal rape, accompanied by the murder and dismemberment of the victim's corpse) are two sides of the same social phenomenon - the traditional (orthodox) attitude to the human body and to human sexuality. Sexuality in traditional moral systems is transformed into a pathological tendency to torture the human body. This should be remembered by all</em>  <em>Hotham-intellectuals who love to talk about "the moral force of traditional ideals" and "transformative impact of Christian morality."</em> " <br><br>  <b>‚ÄúI hate two things: racism and blacks‚Äù - anecdote</b> <br><br>  Although, in fact, it was possible not to make a new heading, but to continue under the previous one.  I will not tell you anything new.  Yes, people kill other people simply because they have different skin color, or they speak different languages, or believe in another god (and it does not matter that this god forbids killing).  But on this occasion, however, there are no indignant posts on the forum.  But oral sex is just the same world evil.  So, thirteen years ago, in Rwanda, over a hundred days, more than eight hundred thousand people were killed (800,000).  <a href="http://martintorp.livejournal.com/59297.html">The genocide in Rwanda in 1994</a> was the story of how Hutu people physically exterminated Tutsi people.  Rwanda once again reminds that if a person is free to allow him to overstep the bounds, he turns into an animal.  And that driving an entire country for the sake of some of its goals is not very difficult.  And the rest of the world will not do anything - it will be as we say. <br><br>  On February 4, the Quebec village of Herouxville adopted the Code of Conduct for the Residents of the Village.  Not a word about immigrants in the operative part of the Code is not.  But for some reason, all the newspapers, TV, parties and affinity groups call this program document the " <a href="http://tor-ont.livejournal.com/41255.html">Code of Conduct for Immigrants</a> ."  Moreover, almost immediately the village even had <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%25C3%25A9rouxville">its own page on Wikipedia</a> .  Residents of the Quebec village of Herouville are tired of political correctness and tolerance.  I remember that in one of the ‚ÄúSouth Park‚Äù series, the creators of the series, through Stan‚Äôs mouth, tried to convey to this planet a simple truth: ‚ÄúTolerance does not mean a dull silence.‚Äù  Although, of course, all these national issues are one big insoluble problem.  I believe that after about 869 years, all races will mix up and only one race will remain on the planet - a man.  But you probably won't live to see it. <br><br>  <strong>Porn actor Alexei Khaletsky</strong> &lt;/ lj-cut&gt; <br><br>  <a href="http://kv.by/index2007080601.htm">Published in "Computer News" (‚Ññ8, 2007)</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288564/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288564/</a></p>
