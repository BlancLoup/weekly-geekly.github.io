  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Russian program to create a global satellite Internet network may lose a single investor</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f38/7b1/c9d/f387b1c9dc1c7d6b92607c4bf6d66231.jpg"><br><br>  In May of this year on Habr√© was <a href="https://habr.com/post/412321/">published the</a> news about the domestic project of creating a global satellite Internet network.  The authors of the project believe that the global satellite network will provide a continuous communication channel for unmanned vehicles, the Internet of things and secure data transmission. <br><br>  The name of the project is ‚ÄúSphere‚Äù, and its approximate cost is 300 billion rubles, as previously reported by the Deputy Director General for Strategic Development and Innovations of the RKS company Yevgeny Nesterov.  This is one of the most ambitious projects of the national program "Digital Economy".  Recently it became known that the only major investor in the program, Vnesheconombank (VEB), decided to refuse to participate in the design and financing of the GISS. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  According to the initial plans, part of the funding for the project should be allocated from the budget, and some - provided by commercial organizations.  But since the project is very expensive and difficult to implement, at the moment there are practically no business people among those who want to participate in it.

      As for the VEB bank, it declared its intention to refuse to participate in the project quite officially - with the help of a letter drawn up by the bank's board member Alexey Ivanchenko.  The author proposes to exclude VEB as a co-performer of events that are related to the financing and design of GISS.  At the same time, the bank declares its readiness to take part in events of the national program that are associated with the development of digital start-ups, as <a href="https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/3752454">reported</a> by Kommersant. <br><br>  At the same time, representatives of Roskosmos say that they have not yet received notifications about the withdrawal of VEB from the project, therefore the state corporation continues to work on financing options for Sphere.  One option is private investment. <br><br>  VEB‚Äôs withdrawal from the project was discussed on September 5 at a meeting of the working group under the presidium of the Presidential Council for Strategic Development and National Projects.  As already reported, the board approved the passport of the national program at a meeting on September 17.  Then it was decided that the details of financing the project should be determined by 2020.  Roskosmos, RCS and responsible development institutions were appointed as responsible. <br><br>  Not only the implementation of the project, but even its design causes difficulties - the design period has already been postponed from 2021 to 2022.  It was originally planned that a consortium with the participation of VEB, Roscosmos and other organizations would work on creating a satellite network.  In addition, Rostelecom showed interest.  In May, the president of the company announced that he was actively discussing with the Roskosmos a project to provide the Internet with hard-to-reach and remote areas. <br><br>  The payback period of the project may take more than ten years, so its investment attractiveness is not too high.  As for the Russian space industry, so far this project has not been officially presented to it, the configuration of the project is still not very clear.  And for its realization it is necessary to attract ‚Äúcolossal investments‚Äù, which are not very easy to obtain due to the fact that the market itself is not so big.  In the Russian Federation, the satellite communications market is hundreds of millions of dollars, and the cost of the project is several billion. <br><br>  ‚ÄúFor the Russian market, this kind of grouping will be completely commercially ineffective.  The only task of the project is to come up with a new way of financing the space industry, ‚Äùsaid the CEO of Momentus startup Mikhail Kokorich. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/424561/">https://habr.com/ru/post/424561/</a></p>
