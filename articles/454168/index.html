How were updated "Luzhniki" before the World Cup</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The time has come to tell you how we prepared the Luzhniki Stadium for the World Cup.  The INSISTEMS and LANIT-Integration teams received low-current, fire-prevention, multimedia and IT systems.  In fact, it is still early to write memoirs.  But, I'm afraid, when the time comes for this, a new reconstruction will happen, and my material will become obsolete. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/619/e5a/951/619e5a9516a39e7137917ed7f3cb3533.jpg"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Reconstruction or new construction </h2><br>  I really love the story.  I freeze before the house of a century there.  Sacred delight covers when they say that there lived a name (well, you must, it was in this tank that the famous writer was throwing garbage).  But the question of where to live, most, I think, will choose a new home with modern communications and security.  That's because the standards of our life over the past 200 years have changed very much.  And even 20 years ago, a lot was different. <br><br>  Therefore, the reconstruction of old buildings and their adaptation to modern use is always more difficult than new construction.  In the old dimensions it is necessary to place modern engineering systems and comply with all building codes and regulations.  Sometimes such a task is impossible in principle.  Then let out special technical conditions.  That is, all the participants in the construction site throw out their hands: ‚ÄúThey could not ...‚Äù

      When Russia received the right to host the World Cup, no one had any questions as to which stadium would be the main one.  Of course, Luzhniki, where all the main sporting events of our country took place: the last match in the presence of 103 thousand spectators was played by the legendary Lev Yashin, there was the opening and closing of the Olympics-80 (and for the first time in the USSR they sold fanta and Coca-Cola hack for a bottle). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/42e/275/08a/42e27508aab7eed275ea5efcfbf875b3.png"></div><br>  In the "Luzhniki", who forgot, passed the Champions League final in 2008, and in 2013 - the World Championships in Athletics.  It seemed we would have to do almost nothing.  Yet ready and tested in practice. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/19a/377/8d2/19a3778d2492534241d3cc582548627c.png"></div><br>  A person far from sports will never understand why it was necessary to spend 24 billion rubles for reconstruction.  Only the Grand Sports Arena!  Apart from inspection pavilions, accreditation center, volunteer center, parking in the territory! <br><br>  And the answer is this: in sport in general (and in football in the first place) huge, simply unreal money came.  And changed industry standards in construction.  And the Ministry of Internal Affairs has new requirements for objects with a massive presence of people.  And in the FSO, and the FSB something appeared.  And the requirements of FIFA (International Football Federation, which was the organizer of the World Championship) were changing right before our eyes, during inspection visits. <br><br>  The numbers speak for themselves.  20 years ago, the most expensive player was worth 25 million euros.  It was the Brazilian Ronaldo - a super mega-star of those years.  And last year, the 22-year-old Sasha Golovin left for the famous, but provincial Monaco for 30 million. But the 20-year-old Frenchman Mbapp√© moved to PSG for 200 million. The most amazing thing is that these costs pay off. <br><br>  Through the sale of rights to television broadcasts.  The FIFA World Cup eventually watched 3.5 billion viewers.  In order for this to happen, a super-modern TV broadcasting system was needed. <br><br><ul><li>  At the expense of tickets (they showed me tickets for the World Cup final match, the nominal price of which was 800 thousand rubles). </li><li>  Due to the widespread sale of snacks, drinks, souvenirs.  Follow the logic: in order to sell a lot of goods in a limited area, a lot of rich buyers should gather in this place.  What should I do to get them there?  They should be interesting, fun, comfortable and safe. </li><li>  Due to the sale of ... prestige and exclusive.  The most "major" places in the stadium are in the sky boxes.  These are rooms located at the most convenient height around the ring stands.  Each is designed for 14 people.  There is a bathroom and a kitchen, 2 large TVs.  And access to your own beach.  Sorry - the podium.  Renting a sky-box for 7 matches of the World Cup cost $ 2.5 million.  Looking ahead, I say, they built 102, and it turned out to be small. </li></ul><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5cf/9a2/e87/5cf9a2e87ddd4b2af3bc758ec526e0b1.png"></div><br>  It was necessary just a month before the start of the World Cup to urgently re-equip the restaurant in another 15 temporary sky-boxes.  Have you multiplied?  Have you already compared the revenue from renting sky boxes to the cost of the entire renovation?  (The only pity is that almost all of this money went to FIFA.) <br><br>  So: nothing of this in the "Luzhniki" was not. <br><br>  And it was also hard to see from almost anywhere.  Because of the racetracks and the small slope of the stands everything was very, very far away. <br><br>  At the same time, the city authorities decided to preserve the historic facade of the Luzhniki Stadium.  And so began the "reconstruction."  When I first got to the arena, the dismantling was already over and the stadium was reminiscent of the scenery from the movie ‚ÄúShirley Myrli‚Äù.  Remember "Vnukovo Airport"? <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/14d/150/11c/14d15011c70d4831289aba60b30cb808.png"></div><br>  So everything, apart from the historical facade, was redone.  As it turned out, not in vain.  For example, when making a ‚Äúpie‚Äù of a field, they dug up a trolley (a surprise from the last reconstruction remained, such a ‚Äúmaster's signature‚Äù).  There was no waterproofing at all, but there was a direct communication of the stadium lawn with the Moscow River.  Probably to justify the name.  "Luzhniki" - it's from the flood meadows gone. <br><br><h2>  How it all began </h2><br>  The memory is arranged so that over time there are only pleasant memories.  And photos helpfully help to resurrect all the bright moments.  Here we are taking pictures in the center of the field (and photographs, by the way, the fire inspector who was allowed to walk around the field so that he would forget about the ‚Äújambs‚Äù that he had just observed during the tests), but for the first time they turned on the scoreboard (and the second one I didn‚Äôt want to work), here in the empty stadium bowl ‚ÄúVictory Day‚Äù is rattling (an hour before that I realized that everything was gone). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aef/261/a73/aef261a73ece481c09bf14247f98e9eb.png"></div><br>  I deleted photos of the dusty and at the same time wet hell that were shown to the curator of the construction by the Moscow government (according to the schedule we had to install and run IT equipment there). <br><br>  But even now I remember how difficult and ... scary it was. <br><br>  It is terrible that a lot of things have been done for the first time, on scales, on responsibility (everyone is free to decide before whom he bears her).  I do not know what the guys we worked with thought, but I felt like a Boris from the film ‚ÄúAndrei Rublev‚Äù by Tarkovsky.  He also pretended to be a specialist and ordered to cast a bell, but "the father - the dog - died, but he did not pass the secret."  So he did everything on a whim.  And did! <br><br>  But he was alone, and we have a team.  And everyone helped each other, supported, reassured.  Not everyone withstood the strain.  One morning, "lost" foreman.  Phone is not available.  The wife says: "I got into the car in the morning and drove to work."  Through the traffic police began to look for a car.  The last time the camera caught, as he and the Moscow Ring Road turned into the area (he had nothing to do there).  In general, 3 days no one knew, they thought the worst.  On the fourth day I found it.  In Rostov-on-Don.  They said that the guy had a nervous breakdown. <br><br>  And our GUI, a prudent and phlegmatic person in life, somehow snatched the phone from the interlocutor and threw it at the concrete wall.  Then the fight began, the police arrived, all were taken to the police station.  There they reconciled. <br><br><h2>  Add people </h2><br>  The management vertical, in which everyone wants to distinguish himself before the higher one, works like this.  The installer reports to the foreman that he laid 100 meters of cable before lunch.  The foreman understands that there is still half a day ahead and reports to the foreman that today we will pave 200 meters (the stadium is very large, the foreman did not know that his worker was left after lunch to move the warehouse).  The brigadier orders to speed up the work and reports to the section chief that by the end of the day we will press and lay 300 meters.  And then it is clear.  As streams flock to the river, so this embellished information goes higher and higher.  And reality becomes more and more beautiful. <br><br>  And now the Mayor is told that the stadium will be commissioned in 3 months, that is, six months ahead of time.  The mayor speaks on TV against the background of a green field and orders the start of complex tests of all systems.  To finish in just 3 months.  And leaves.  And we stay and listen to "Victory Day." <br><br>  And then we go to the meeting to discuss what to do now.  The head of the construction proposed a completely new and absolutely brilliant solution: ‚ÄúAdd people, organize the second shift‚Äù (that's probably what Stalin said to Zhukov when defending Moscow in 1941). <br><br>  I must say that the construction at this moment really came to an end.  And the closer to him, the more qualified people are required.  There are always a few.  The decision came by itself: and let the same people work in two shifts.  The first time I saw people a) come to work at 9:00, b) work until the next morning, c) show work to the inspector, d) until 17:00 eliminate comments and go home, e) ... come to work at 9 : 00 <br><br>  Well, that worked in this mode for long.  The general contractor one day just turned off the electricity for the night.  Not agreed to him the rate of the night duty. <br>  Or here's another story.  In order to assemble and launch fire alarms, it is necessary to mount fire detectors on the ceiling, tie them into a train like light bulbs in the Christmas garland and connect them to the central station (there are up to 256 devices in the train, and there are enough loops to protect all the rooms).  Here we go into the locker room teams, and the ceiling is not.  And the plan of complex tests is.  Think we ripped it off?  No matter how wrong!  A very funny picture came out: a large hall, and sensors hanging from the ceiling.  A bit like fishing hooks from a diver's point of view. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b58/b2e/48a/b58b2e48a066726714269033d617e49c.png"></div><br>
<h2>  Swan, 3 crayfish and 5 pikes </h2><br>  Today the industry standard has become BIM design.  This is not just a three-dimensional model, but also a specification of equipment and materials that is generated and adjusted automatically.  Of course, everything is more complicated in nature than on the computer screen: somewhere with height they made a mistake, somewhere a beam appeared, somewhere new demands were received from the customer, and installation was already done, etc. But in general, when all the designers work in a single information space, errors are an order of magnitude less. <br>  But both we and the designers of the subcontracting companies began designing the Luzhniki in 2014, when BIM models were still exotic. <br><br>  The peculiarity of the stadium is that with not the largest area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe sub-funeral premises (165 thousand square meters) there is nothing typical there.  This is not a high-rise tower, where 45 of the 50 floors are the same. <br><br>  Still, the stadium is very large and very saturated with engineering systems.  Therefore, there were many contractors.  And each has its own production culture, accuracy, and just human qualities.  Plus, during the construction had to make many changes to the projects.  The result is easy to guess. <br>  Here is one example.  The fire automatics system is complicated by the fact that 3 groups of people participate in its installation and commissioning (the picture does not change much even if they work in the same company): ventilators install valves (smoke removal, air overpressure, fire retardant) and their actuators , electricians supply the power supply to them, and low-voltage sources connect control cables.  Everyone does it according to their project.  In the Luzhniki Stadium, where there are about 4,000 such devices, three subcontractors in the projects had a different number of devices, and they were located in different places behind the suspended ceiling.  How do we solve this problem?  That's right: added people. <br><br><h2>  Sad and funny </h2><br>  Among other things, we had to mount turnstiles around the perimeter of the stadium.  It was a second security circuit (the first one was mounted at the entrance to the territory, they carried out personal searches and checked out a Fan ID).  And we first decided to put the usual turnstiles there.  But Luzhniki employees explained that there are people who jump even full-height turnstiles.  So at the entrance to the arena appeared designs, resembling anti-tank hedgehogs with peaks. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/87f/cb0/2fd/87fcb02fd4ad9f1f54b53886eae4985d.png"></div><br>  The turnstiles themselves were also mounted not without incident.  First, they chose installation sites for a long time, tried on them for a long time (to avoid getting to the already laid underground communications), waited a long time for us to cast the foundations, cut grooves for laying cables, installed hatches ... And then one morning we come and see that overnight stadium asphalted.  And under our fresh asphalt there were all our markings, shafts and hatches.  In general, the area has become as flat as ... (remember Zhvanetsky's ‚ÄúThe Demolition Man‚Äôs Tale‚Äù?) <br><br>  We sit, we think how to be.  But then the construction manager came and said: ‚ÄúYou have metal hatches.  You can try to find them with a mine detector. ‚Äù <br><br>  Or another such story.  The location of fire protection equipment (sensors, speakers, buttons, strobe lamps, pointers) is regulated by SNiPs.  Well, we assembled them and put them into operation.  But Luzhniki security experts explained that a crowd of drunken fans would root them out and press the buttons of all the manual detectors.  We had to carry out "anti-vandal activities" (this is what the project section is called): something was raised higher, something was taken to the bars, and something ... I will not say. <br><br>  And video surveillance is our special pride.  Probably nowhere in the world there is such a density of cameras per square meter.  At the stadium there are 2000 of them, not counting a special video surveillance system for spectators, with the help of which one can be guaranteed to recognize a person from the opposite tribune.  And they are all integrated into the Safe City system.  From the situational center of the stadium (also our work) you can see not only all the images from the arena cameras, but also the territory, and from special jobs - the whole city. <br><br>  A lot of trouble brought the TVs, which we assembled at the stadium more than 1000 pieces.  We put 3 of them in the VIP box, because the visor over it was covered by the display, and a duplicate ‚Äúpicture‚Äù was displayed on these TVs. <br><br>  It turns out that passions in the VIP-box boil no worse than on the fan stand!  For example, the king of Spain broke the television during the quarterfinal match with Russia.  They say, accidentally hurt ... Chair, I guess. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f05/584/c14/f05584c142bd13c99004b31ee0a0a60e.png"></div><br>  Like Tarkovsky in Andrei Rublev, everything ended well.  And Messi came to the opening match, and the Russian team won both their matches at Luzhniki, and the final was a success.  And at the very end there was that terrible downpour at the awards ceremony (directly ‚ÄúThe Master and Margarita‚Äù) and a lone umbrella over the VIP-platform. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c4f/54c/a86/c4f54ca86ea71e983ee6681bd7c43eac.png"></div><br><h2>  The best job in the world </h2><br>  Remember, several years ago in Australia they announced an international competition for the best job in the world?  You had to live on a tropical island, feed giant turtles and blog on the Internet.  And getting about 100 thousand dollars a year for this. <br><br>  But I think that the best in the world (in Moscow, for sure) is the work of those guys who mow the lawn at Luzhniki every morning. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/775/093/429/77509342962de7ad77ad940ef022f627.png"></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/454168/">https://habr.com/ru/post/454168/</a></p>
