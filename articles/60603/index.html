      Localization PC Boheme, Studio Fargus <br><br>  FALLOUT: THE POST-NUCLEAR ROLE PLAYING GAME <br>  or <br>  REVIVAL: POST NUCLEAR ROLE GAME <br><br>  First of all about the name: why exactly Revival, because Fallout is <br>  military term meaning precipitation of radioactive fallout or <br>  contaminated terrain.  And then, that the Renaissance, zvychit <br>  Much more beautiful than all the more accurate words that were given <br>  to think.  And what a difference, the terrible consequences of nuclear war <br>  or the revival of a new civilization, it already depends only on the player, <br>  that there will be in the end. <br><br>  Now about the plot.  As such, the linear plot is not here, because it <br>  RPG and not a quest of some kind.  After completing the first inevitable <br>  Water Chip mining tasks (if desired, you can complete <br>  almost srazy and not at war with anyone), almost complete freedom sets in <br>  action.  Get yourself on the map, stick the hero, talk <br>  with people yes pismatpivaysya to the new world.  With all the characters, <br>  gangs and organizations can quarrel or join the union, <br>  to carry out (not simply) their orders or to receive an order for <br>  eliminating them (also not for thanks).  The game will not end only from <br>  the fact that you have killed a good character or have agreed to cooperate <br>  with bad.  It is not bad to hire a copy of the book, and even a few. <br><br>  Determined only the general direction of the development of the plot.  Action <br>  purposefully, you can actually achieve what is suitable. <br>  Games for the present kpta.  After a short period of adaptation <br>  By the way, you start living in this world, glowing from <br>  Radiation and inhabited mostly by simple people with their <br>  problems and not at all global goals.  And only a lot <br>  Your posts change the political climate of the country and at the end <br>  the ends lead igpy to one of several logical connections. <br><br>  ATTENTION: The game contains 2.5 megabytes of pure text! <br>  This is an absolute record of all time and people. <br>  For example: Twinsen 2 - 200 k, <br>  Diablo - 100 k <br>  Monkey Island 3 - less than 200 k <br><br>  Here, about 500k - only names, names, <br>  descriptions, and messages. <br>  ALL the rest, more than 750 pages of A4 format <br>  - there is a meaningful conversational text! <br>  Which book did you see so much, eh? <br><br>  So yourself, please see how much the script was moved and what it cost. <br>  for poor localizers to adjust the friends to the friends for all these tons of conversations. <br><br>  The only product of this class released in the last few years is <br>  Daggerfall.  But daggerfall never showed up with full Russian translation <br>  (inscriptions on compacts) and is so replete with bugs that <br>  admirers have already stopped pumping out endless fixes. <br>  Further, once we started talking about bugs, smoothly switch to the Renaissance. <br>  Although the bugs here are just to the devil (!! native bugs, not translation !!), <br>  I‚Äôm glad that they didn‚Äôt fake a game, as it almost happened with daggerfall. <br>  Virtually all of them do not affect the course of the game, appear in trifles and <br>  a real player, sooner than 99% of them will not notice or refer to <br>  localization errors. <br>  So play this game!  Enjoy her!  spit on all the glitches and <br>  inconsistencies.  Finish bypassing what can be done better, better done; <br>  - for nothing less buggy and more thoughtful, in our time <br>  the domination of the hated Microsoft can't just come out.  After what <br>  This is not necessary for anyone, and the main thing is not profitable.  That's it. <br><br>  Now about the translation. <br><br>  We have changed everything in the game, and it seems they changed quite well.  But <br>  requires several comments. <br><br>  1. Do not forget that you are playing the RUSSIAN version, and <br>  not at all in the TRANSLATION of the English game, as some believe. <br>  If someone wants to be as close as possible to the original <br>  Translation - he himself does not know what he wants!  Pest ychit <br>  English or force text in Stylus. <br><br>  Speaking of Stylus.  Unlike some <br>  Russian version, here, no electronic tellers <br>  in the localization process is not used.  All texts are translated <br>  Real people, and if somewhere in the way of a creeping phrase, then <br>  it is an untracked brain wedge of a live interpreter, and not at all <br>  consequence of the reduction of the time costs. <br><br>  2. In the game there are two text modes, with census and <br>  without her.  By default censure is enabled.  But if you want <br>  to revive some dialogues and battle cries, then in the INSTALLATION menu <br>  censor can be turned off.  Then wherever it asks for and demands <br>  Situation characters begin to express quite 'naturally'. <br>  As such, the mat in the game is small, so the censor filter <br>  Neutralizyet including, some grybyh but not quite <br>  swear words. <br><br>  3. You can play both for 'him' and for 'her', in English <br>  language of case divisions is not.  Retrieve all messages and <br>  Dialogues were incredibly difficult, but doable.  However themselves <br>  the creators of the game were often mistaken, driving in the unreal <br>  The phrase is a text from the male of the genus, for example: 'Take him away!'. <br>  Psychology, what to do.  Everywhere where this was noticed <br>  we corrected, but if you meet, do not discredit. <br><br>  4. While watching a game, a question may arise - why <br>  voiced not all characters?  Everything is very simple, for technical <br>  For example, the Pypsky voice "weighs" about four times more <br>  Native sound.  Votes in the game is exactly as much as <br>  allows the size of the compact, no more, no less. <br><br>  5. So, it turned out that in the end the text was translated <br>  pretty big gryppa people.  In connection with which there was a problem <br>  coordination of all names and titles.  When it turned <br>  Attention in the game already lay about half of the entire text. <br>  Start the text, but to save nerves and time <br>  left the most 'popular' translation options. <br>  This is the question of why Boneyard is Bonypd, and <br>  Shady Sands are Shady Sands and not Dark Sands, for example. <br><br>  In general, when someone in a hurry translates a small, torn <br>  out of context breaks, very funny things are getting. <br>  How do you like this version of the translation, Boneyard - Bone Dvor, <br>  Micro-Fussion Cells are the Micropactors and the DeathClaw are the Great Fingers. <br>  When I read, I didn‚Äôt fall out of the chair ... <br>  Represent the picture: During the program on Kostinyom Dvopy <br>  you were viciously attacked by the Good Fingers, but were successfully rewarded from <br>  rifle micropactors. <br>  Or the phrase: 'Golden light, for the third back pass, please!' <br>  It means only to illuminate one of the corridors. <br><br>  Lazy Tips. <br><br>  How to pump a hero, you can offer your honest recipe: <br>  In Bonypda (on the coast, down from Khran. 13) there is a portion <br>  lands on which city-like chydovischesya roam - Ryki Dying, <br>  for each kill 1000 experience.  So, pump up <br>  Accuracy, go to the picture, kill all the monsters, then <br>  we leave, sytki are treated in the next picture, we go again <br>  (monsters have already been born ...) and so on at least until 20th level. <br>  At monsters, attention is not appealing, so <br>  if the hero is dead, then you can just run through the picture, <br>  and your companion will take care of everything. <br>  By the way, if the pictures with the monsters do not return to <br>  Go ahead, then there is the cheapest (and best) <br>  Shop of Skytala Runners. <br><br>  How to get for free the best weapons, ammunition, armor: <br>  With prides and nepravdam, we extract the faith, the kychy preparations from <br>  Radiation and go to the Glow (coast, right lower. The corner of the map) <br>  there we pump up to the loss of hairs with all sorts of anti-radians, <br>  we tie the rope to the beam and forward.  Down there is everything <br>  the coolest thing in the game, except the plasma gun and <br>  Broni with motor.  In the same place, on the first floor there is a cassette that <br>  eager to get Cabbot from the Brotherhood of Steel.  The game feels like <br>  some deficiency of dynamite, so, he is there too. <br>  Everything would be great, just to be very careful. <br>  calculate such operations.  Usually, you get out <br>  Already unviable body. <br><br>  Almost all the time the game comes to struggle with a certain <br>  the problem is that the hero can take too little with him. <br>  This disadvantage can be circumvented.  The truth is not investigated <br>  to the end is the probability that the solution is not always <br>  bydet work. <br>  Here is the recipe: Hire a toy (any other than a dog), then <br>  when you need to carry with you, for example, 20 trophy guns <br>  just feed them with it, and by arrival you will be in the right place. <br>  The mass lifted by the arms (and, in general, by any characters <br>  except for you) it seems not limited in any way, but when you try them <br>  do not be offended, their people are shorter. <br><br>  __________________________________________________ __________ <br><br>  An agreement on the bestial essence of the Anglo-Russian interpreter. <br>  *** only for inside reading *** <br><br>  The man took up the translation of 2.5 MB of game text within 3-4 weeks. <br>  The work is huge and he announced that he had agreed on a significant <br>  parts of the text with two more familiar teachers, promising them a share <br>  from salary.  I must say that this was not the first translation of his <br>  and he perfectly knew what he was fighting for. <br>  After three weeks of vigorous reports on the successful progress of work was <br>  A revision has been carried out, revealing the real volume of the work done, and <br>  it is less than 150k text (about 6% of the total).  Mildly weird <br>  for three people busy translating.  Clearly explain this fact <br>  the interpreter could not, but he assured that he realized his mistakes and the rest of the text <br>  already on the way. <br>  Within a few days, it became clear that the received text is all <br>  what has been translated, because  Translations yporodno povypali speed daily <br>  processing. <br>  At the time of the passage of the months of the month since the beginning of the transfer of the situation <br>  It was like this: the interpreter finally pulled the work and <br>  was limited by the fact that the incumbently sent the correct letters of the text <br>  translated by his acquaintances.  Total came running 600-650 kilobytes. <br>  No explanations, explanations and results of the outcome were given. <br>  Continuing to make sure that you sweat hard over the translation <br>  the person was engaged (presumably in the brief minutes of rest) compiling <br>  game collectors for some company, then, time to transfer <br>  it remained, of course, a little. <br>  For all the experience you want to say: <br><br>  THIS GOATS NAME YAROSLAV !!! <br><br>  One can only hope that our mutual friends will not <br>  to trust him with urgent work, and they will not try to test the same <br>  so much to me. <br><br>  The rest of the text is hastily trying to execute gpyppa <br>  self-serving people who have kindly agreed to lend <br>  help in this difficult time for us.  If not for them, the game would hardly <br>  I saw the light.  Great thanks to them, the heading did not have and does not have to <br>  him not the slightest relationship, as well as to all teachers <br>  which I do not know. <br><br>  PC Boheme // Boodwazer </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/60603/">https://habr.com/ru/post/60603/</a></p>
