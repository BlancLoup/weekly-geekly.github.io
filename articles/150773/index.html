    <h4>  What kind of task? </h4><br>  At the landfill, which is an open ‚Äúbox‚Äù like a yard hockey, the start / finish marks will be made and obstacles will be placed.  The task of the robot is to take off from the starting point, successfully pass an obstacle, reach the landing point and sit at any place on the marker.  Then take off, return to the take-off point, successfully passing an obstacle, and sit down. <br><br><h5>  Polygon layout </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d91/b8c/363/d91b8c363d8036ee10a531648790002e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  Polygon description </h5><br><ul><li>  It is being erected in the open air, it is an open ‚Äúbox‚Äù of the same type as a yard hockey rink. </li><li>  The size of the box is 50 by 25 meters, the height of the walls and partitions inside the perimeter is approximately 3 meters, and the partitions are radiotransparent. </li><li>  Polygon on top of the tightened mesh, preventing the flight of robots beyond.  It is divided into two parts with a partition with a passage of at least 3 meters wide. </li><li>  The starting and landing points are marked with crosses, have an inverted color (white cross on a black background and black cross on white), painted on a plastic / plywood circle, the diameter of a circle is 3 meters. </li><li>  The position of the landing point changes before each flight, moves to a random location within the designated area (shown in the diagram by a dotted line). </li><li>  Separately, the zone of the obstacle is highlighted, within which a partition is installed in a random place before each flight, blocking two thirds of the ‚Äúcorridor‚Äù width. </li></ul><br>  <b>An important fact is that stabilization by GPS is possible.</b> <br><br><h5>  The task </h5><br><ul><li>  Take off from the starting point and fly to the landing point, successfully passing an obstacle. </li><li>  Take off again, returning to the starting point, again passing an obstacle. </li></ul><br>  You can sit at the landing point at any place of the indicated circle (diameter - 3 meters).  The diagram with a dotted line indicates an approximate autonomous flight route. <br><br><h5>  Winner selection criteria </h5><br><ol><li>  Successful assignment: (the device is working!). </li><li>  Among the teams that successfully completed the task, the winner is determined by the minimum travel time (perfection of the navigation and control algorithms).  The best time among successful attempts is counted (that which qualifies as a successful attempt is the information below). </li></ol><br><br><h5>  Conditions </h5><br><ol><li>  A day before the flight, each team is given an accurate drawing of the polygon.  Accuracy - to the error of the laser rangefinder. </li><li>  Flying fully automatic. </li><li>  Telemetry reception is allowed, as well as the availability of remote automatic control from a ground computer.  In this case, any contact with the hands during the flight to the ground-based devices leads to a set-off attempt as unsuccessful. </li><li>  The partitions in the room are radiotransparent. </li><li>  In the flight zone during the execution of the mission can not be people. </li><li>  A judge should be provided with a means of remotely turning off drone engines.  For example, a remote control is transmitted to it, one of the switches of which is assigned to the function of switching off the engines.  The performance of this function is checked before performing the task.  The judge has the right (must) to turn off the engines in the event of inadequate, in his opinion, drone behavior, as well as if he creates a threat to any person who is for some reason in the flight zone. </li><li>  Neither the judge nor the organizer bear any responsibility for possible damage to the drone, including unplanned use of the remote shutdown function. </li><li>  Participants are given several attempts.  Teams perform flights in the order of the draw on one attempt in a circle.  The number of attempts made will be determined after the registration of participants is completed. </li><li>  Any successful attempt at which time is fixed counts. </li><li>  If within 15 minutes from the beginning of the attempt the drone did not take off for any reason, then the attempt is considered unsuccessful. </li><li>  After the drone is taken off the take-off point, any deviation from the flight plan (for example, an unplanned landing) results in the attempt being rejected as unsuccessful. </li><li>  Collision with the walls of the landfill, partitions, contact with the grid does not lead to failure to attempt, if the drone can continue the flight.  It is recommended to have at least some protection for the screws. </li><li>  The control logic of the UAV can be implemented both on the device itself and on the ground computer, which receives telemetry from the drone over the radio channel and carries out control actions over the radio channel. </li><li>  Task execution time is unlimited.  But the size of the room allows you to perform it in 3-5 minutes J. </li></ol><br><br><h5>  Additional terms </h5><br>  ‚ÄúTry your hand: independently or in a team of up to 10 people.  We only limit the age of participants (from 18 years), but do not limit your talents and ingenuity! ‚Äù <br>  The competition will be held in August 2013, applications for participation are accepted until November 15, 2012. <br><br>  Fully <a href="http://www.robots.croc.ru/conditions/">participation conditions</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/150773/">https://habr.com/ru/post/150773/</a></p>
