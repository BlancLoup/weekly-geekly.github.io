      Naturally, this is the current state of the market of TVs connected to the Network (connect TV).  However, the description can be equally attributed to the mobile world before the iPhone-era, when the problem in application development was in a depressing variety of platforms. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I spent several years building a business that functioned in the mobile space before and after the iPhone, and recently tried to bring it to the web and to the connected TV.  I am constantly struck by the similarities of both media and I believe that the television industry should spend some time needed to study the evolution of mobile applications from smart phones to smartphones in order to avoid a few painful lessons. <br><br><h4>  TV world is separated from mobile applications </h4><br><br>  The very meaning of the word "application" may be slightly different for TVs.  In many cases, a TV application is an access point for specific content ‚Äî take YouTube, Netflix, or LoveFilm for example.  In other cases, the application refers to functionality, like Facebook or eBay applications. <br><br>  At some points of particular cynicism, I think to put an end to my company with TV applications, since no one can think of anything new.  ‚ÄúI worked for phones, let's try the same on TV!‚Äù  The correct application will be useful on TV, but at the same time it is important to understand that the TV experience is: <br><br><ul><li>  Often a joint experience.  Mobile phones are personal devices. </li><li>  TV is relaxing.  Multiple attempts to force the user to interact with the TV failed. </li><li>  Consumers hate complex remote controls. </li></ul><br><br>  Many developers, moving from web to TV development, do not understand these nuances.  And this leads, ultimately, to the fact that the application is not used.  Does anyone really want to show their personal information on a shared screen?  Are others watching TV really waiting for you to read your entire Facebook feed? <br><br><h4>  Three Ways to Develop TV Applications </h4><br><br>  There are a total of three separate approaches to the development of television applications: <br><br>  <b>1. TV applications only</b> <br><br>  An application for TV screens or set-top boxes is usually a continuation of favorite web services on the big screen.  In the examples here Spotify, Flickr and of course Twitter from Facebook.  The application needs to be changed to work with the remote control and limited text entry capabilities - which is easier said than done.  Some applications are more suited to switching to television than others.  CNet has <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-33199_7-57412464-221/from-amazon-to-hbo-go-to-youtube-app-availability-on-2012-tvs-compared-big-chart/">an extensive list of</a> music, video and communication applications that exist on TV. <br><br>  <b>2. Mobile apps only</b> <br><br>  These are mobile or tablet applications that complement the TV, but do not interact with it.  An example of this is Zeebox, Flip.tv, GetGlu and Miso.  These programs focus on working simultaneously with watching TV, allowing the user to interact with his personal device while watching.  In this category you can add applications that provide the user with a TV program, additional information and the like.  Studies show that tablets are a natural addition to TV - <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/devices/tablet-and-smartphone-use-tv.html">according to Forrester, 85% of tablet users in the US use their devices when watching TV</a> , according to Nielsen, 30% of the time spent with the tablet is spent simultaneously with watching TV. <br><br>  <b>3. Applications of close work</b> <br><br>  These applications close the gap between mobile and TV experience.  Here, applications use DLNA and AirPlay to select and manage content for a large screen.  The simplest example here is Apple AirPlay, which allows you to play movies from a MacBook on a TV using Apple TV.  Applications of close work allow, for example, to send content from the device to the TV.  It is more difficult to find applications that interact with TV broadcasting functions, rather than using it as a monitor.  Such as, for example, allow you to manage the recording of programs on a set-top box from a smartphone.  However, the detection of content or channels on one device and its subsequent use for broadcasting a signal to a TV is usually a more difficult task, since this already requires integration with a TV or set-top box.  Here innovations start to slip. <br><br><h4>  Nightmare tv fragmentation </h4><br><br>  Development for television or console platforms is difficult, whether you are developing a simple TV application or set-top box, trying to make a ‚Äúclose work‚Äù application or a separate application.  Why? <br><br>  There are 10+ target platforms.  Everyone promotes their ecosystem for a TV or set-top box.  Take Samsung, Panasonic, Sharp, LG, Sony, Yahoo, Google TV, Boxee, InView, WyPlay, YouView and HBBTV for an example - and this is not all listed.  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/articles/google/razrabotka-dlya-android.html">Android is just resting here</a> .  Some of these systems are closed, and some have developer support programs.  The full list is on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_TV">this</a> Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_TV">page</a> .  None of the developers can work immediately on all platforms, but how to choose the right one for success? <br><br>  How many connected TVs?  According to <a href="http://www.cea.org/">CEA</a> , about 260 million TVs were sold in 2011, and 27% of them are connected to the network.  The percentage of TVs that have an Internet connection by default is growing rapidly.  If we assume that all sold connectable televisions are connected to the Internet, the address market is still smaller than the mobile phone market.  In fact, the picture is much more complex. <br><br>  Many ‚ÄúConnected TV‚Äù are TVs that are ready to connect to the Net.  Just this fact does not mean that they will actually be connected to it and use the Internet at work. <br><br>  There are not enough such devices purchased for consumers to understand what is bad in their work.  Good products are developed on user reviews and there are just not enough devices on the market for their manufacturers to begin to understand the demands of consumers.  Moreover, there are no compelling reasons for feedback from consumers when they receive television content on existing systems, such as traditional set-top boxes or TV services on computers or tablets. <br><br><h4>  Will TV have its ‚ÄúiPhone moment‚Äù? </h4><br><br>  Having survived the intrusion of the iPhone into the mobile space, I can say with confidence that this has not happened on the TV market yet.  However, when such a moment comes, it will drastically change the dynamics of development.  This is important for startups working in TV space and the investors behind them. <br><br>  Consider the dynamics of application development in the pre-iPhone era.  Often I had to work with the operator or the phone manufacturer and pay a lot of attention to changes in the target platform.  Working with mobile phone manufacturers and operators is notoriously difficult and time consuming - and although it can make a developer a superstar with the right approach, in most cases it‚Äôs just a waste of time and precious resources. <br><br>  In the post-iPhone era, the way users reach and receive money from applications has radically changed.  There is no longer any need to connect with operators or phone manufacturers - you can simply aim at the obvious leader in this space and place your application in the store.  This ecosystem is not yet in televisions. <br><br>  There are candidates for the role of the iPhone in the television field. <br><br>  According to rumors, <b>Apple</b> is preparing its own television.  The existing Apple TV is a great device, but it‚Äôs not yet an open application platform. <br><br>  <b>Google TV is</b> slowly turning around, but constant progress is quite visible, and it may well be a candidate. <br><br>  <b>The Xbox is</b> also a dark horse, especially considering recent studies that show people are watching content on the Xbox more than playing games with it. <br><br>  And do not forget about the already <b>existing TV companies</b> that have been operating in the market for some time.  TiVo, Sky, YouView in Britain, HBB TV in Europe are all actively working on the development of TV platforms, and Roku is currently providing Over The Top (OTT) prefixes for several years. <br><br><h4>  On whom to bet? </h4><br><br>  Television is currently an intricate place to work, an industry that may pass the inflection point in the next few years.  It is very difficult to make the right bet when it comes to developing applications for television platforms.  However, if you want to see a list of goals that you can focus on, then I would list the following: <br><br>  <b>TV producers</b> : Samsung and Sony because of their sales volumes. <br><br>  Console <b>manufacturers</b> : Boxee, Roku and several other leaders. <br><br>  <b>Platforms</b> : Google TV is the most open platform and invests heavily in encouraging developers, including signing agreements with leading services like Hulu.  Sales volumes are low at the moment, so stay tuned for <a href="http://www.google.com/tv/">announcements</a> . <br><br>  And, of course, <b>Apple</b> .  The next important step could be the opening of the current Apple TV for application developers (the platform is currently closed).  Many are waiting for the announcement of this TV company. <br><br>  Television will have its own ‚ÄúiPhone moment,‚Äù but it may well be that it will not belong to Apple at all. <br><br><h4>  Smart TV in Russia </h4><br><br>  But the opinion of our partners, developers from iD EAST, engaged in the development of applications for smart TV in Russia: <br><br>  <a href="http://www.id-east.ru/">We</a> consider this area to be very promising and have signed an agreement to develop for the main TV platforms, currently applications are being developed.  We meet with all the manufacturer of TV platforms and agree on cooperation, the most interested are Samsung and LG, they are ready to co-finance and technically support developers, providing registration in the system and test TVs.  We expect a good profit from TV applications - at the level of mobile applications.  Our plans include not only the development of multimedia applications, but also shopping and the media and even banking, because users have demand for such information.  The future of Smart TV also depends on the manufacturers, namely, their support from developers and users who will have to re-vote for the applications they use on mobile devices. <br><br>  Another company that thinks the scale of the OS: <br><br>  We could develop applications if there were such orders.  But another is more interesting ... To enter this market with the new operating system ‚ÄúPhantom‚Äù - we created a proof of the concept, move on, but as long as there is no necessary scale of investment or a business partner, the creation of a new OS is not going as fast as we would like. <br><br>  And Ukrainian colleagues: <br><br>  Evaluated several projects have not reached the development.  Customers do not understand the market and ROI. <br><br>  <i><b>From the authors</b> : This is a translation of an <a href="http://www.visionmobile.com/blog/2012/04/developing-for-tv-crossing-the-chasm-between-screens/">article by</a> our partners from VisionMobile, who publish <a href="http://apps4all.ru/analytics/ekonomika-razrabotchikov-2011.html">annual mobile development reports</a> and market research.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>From our <a href="http://apps4all.ru/developers/">Russian developers</a> units for TV are engaged in units.</i>  <i>Both the global and the Russian TV application markets are in anticipation of growth, and access to it is due to the adoption of technology and market niche, rather than the hope of full profit.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/144862/">https://habr.com/ru/post/144862/</a></p>
