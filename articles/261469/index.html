I want to give you the opportunity to feel that there is a whole world that is diligently hidden from us - the world of mathematics.  This is a portal to an uncharted reality, the key to understanding the deep secrets of the Universe and ourselves.  Mathematics is not the only portal, there are others.  But in a sense he is the most obvious.  And that is why he is so camouflaged, as if a board with the inscription: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to come here.‚Äù  But actually it is necessary.  And when we enter it, we remember who we are: not the small cogs of a big machine, not the lonely souls, living on the outskirts of the Universe.  We are the Creators of this world, capable of giving each other beauty and love. ‚Äù  - Edward Frenkel. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Mathematical knowledge is like no other.  Our perception of the physical world can always be distorted, but the perception of mathematical truths does not allow distortion.  These are objective, eternal, unshakable truths.  A mathematical formula or theorem means the same thing for anyone, anywhere, regardless of gender, religion, or skin color.  It will carry the same meaning in a thousand years.  However, it is even more striking that all this belongs to us.  Nobody has the right to patent a mathematical formula - all these formulas are ours, common.  There is nothing in this world that, being so deep and refined, is at the same time equally accessible to all.  It is almost impossible to believe that such a reservoir of knowledge really exists.  This knowledge is too valuable to give it to only a few "chosen ones."  It belongs to each of us.

      One of the key functions of mathematics is the ordering of information.  This is what distinguishes Van Gogh's brush strokes from simple paint stains.  The appearance of three-dimensional printing will mark a radical transformation of the reality we are used to: from the sphere of physical objects, everything begins to flow into the sphere of information and data.  Thanks to 3D printers, soon we will be able to create matter from information as easy as today we convert PDF files into books, and MP3 files into music.  In this wondrous new world, mathematics will take an even more important, central place - as a way of organizing and organizing information and as a means of transforming information into physical reality. <br><br>  In this book I will talk about one of the greatest ideas that have arisen in mathematics over the past fifty years, the Langlands program, which many consider to be the theory of the Great Unification of Mathematics.  This fascinating theory weaves a web of deep connections between areas of mathematics, which, it would seem, should be at a distance of light years from each other: algebra, geometry, number theory, analysis, and quantum physics.  If we imagine these areas as the continents of the secret world of mathematics, then the Langlands program is like a teleportation device that can instantly transfer us from one continent to another and back. <br><br>  I want to tell you about all this, so that you see those aspects of mathematics that rarely draws attention to: inspiration, deep ideas, stunning revelations.  Mathematics is a way of escaping from the limits of our customary, unlimited flight of fantasy in search of truth.  George Cantor, the creator of the theory of infinity, wrote: "The essence of mathematics lies in its freedom."  Mathematics teaches us to analyze reality, investigate facts, follow them wherever they lead us.  It frees us from dogma and prejudice, feeds our innovative potential.  Thus, the fact that mathematics gives us goes far beyond the bounds of the subject itself. <br><br>  Mathematics is rigor plus intellectual honesty, coupled with reliance on facts.  In a world whose main driving force today is mathematics, we all should have free access to the mathematical knowledge we need in order to protect ourselves from arbitrary decisions made by a small handful of authorities.  Where there is no mathematics, there is no freedom. <br><br>  My book is an invitation to this rich, dazzling world.  I wrote it for people with no math education.  If you think that mathematics is too complicated and you will not understand anything, if mathematics scares you, but at the same time you are curious about whether there is anything in it that is really worth knowing, then this book is for you. <br><br><h5>  about the author </h5><br>  <a href="http://www.edwardfrenkel.com/">Edouard Frenkel</a> is an American mathematician who studies representation theory, algebraic geometry, and mathematical physics.  He currently works as a professor of mathematics at the University of California at Berkeley. <br>  Edward Frenkel was born in Kolomna, in the family of an engineer.  After he was not accepted at the Moscow State University mekhmat because of his Jewish origin, Frenkel entered the University of Oil and Gas.  During his studies, he attended the Israel Gelfand seminar, worked with Boris Feigin and Dmitry Fuchs.  After graduation, Edward was invited to teach at Harvard. <br><br>  More information about the book can be found on <a href="http://www.piter.com/product/lyubov-i-matematika-serdtse-skrytoy-realnosti">the publisher's website.</a> <br>  All books from the New Science series are <a href="http://www.piter.com/collection/new-science">here.</a> <br>  <a href="http://storage.piter.com/upload/contents/978549601121/978549601121_X.pdf">Table of contents</a> <br>  <a href="http://storage.piter.com/upload/contents/978549601121/978549601121_p.pdf">Excerpt</a> <br>  For Habrozhiteley a 25% discount on the coupon - <b>Frenkel</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/261469/">https://habr.com/ru/post/261469/</a></p>
