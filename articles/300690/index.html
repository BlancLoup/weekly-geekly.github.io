But every now and then you go to the Internet and someone comes up with and makes successful projects.  The main stumbling block in this case is the limited thinking.  Or the feeling of ‚Äúthat the world owes me so‚Äù.  By the way, the second reason is more often a hindrance.  With the limitations of the mind can be fought, for this there are millions of ways.  Self-development, self-improvement and similar fashionable things can make you a great thinker.  But these trainings are not able to change your sense of greatness.  We have received too much from life at once, so it seems to us that this should happen all the time.  We come to work and there should be glad that we have appeared.  Appearing in the store and there should happen a ritual of worship.  That's just nothing to worship, and you are a complete zero.

      I came up with a cool project, well, I thought so then.  Something similar to Product Hunt, slightly adding a pinch of Kickstarter and Indiegogo.  The essence of the project was to make weekly collections of the best projects of the same direction.  For example, we dedicate one week to organizers and make a selection of the best applications.  And so on.  Purpose: to help in the promotion of beginners.  True goal: to become an expert.  How?  To make huge samples, not some miserable Top-10, but immediately Top-100 or Top-200.  With so many selected options, a dozen others could shoot you in the queens.  ‚ÄúI noticed earlier, even before it became popular.‚Äù  I even came up with a cool name (true, cool): Catcher Of Tech.  It sounds epic and this is by the most modest estimates.  As a result, the name remained the most inspiring part of the project. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2ab/bf2/1cd/2abbf21cd8cc4b1daf8fc401ca9c55c5.jpeg"><br><br>  The next step was to search for the distribution model of my collections, website or e-mail newsletter?  Facebook group or Twitter profile?  Or all at once?  Of course, I could not donate to any available channel of dissemination of information and did everything.  The profile on Twitter, the group on Facebook (never saw the light of day), even registered on the mailing list website and made the website.  I thought if you do something, you need to do it thoroughly. <br><br>  But I did nothing.  More precisely, how - I made a small selection on ProductHunt, from where I was going to pull the data I needed.  And then it did not work out.  Is the name cool?  Yes.  Idea?  Yes.  Where is my audience?  Where is the critical mass of users, enthusiastic comments and a number of advertisers lined up?  All is not and is not.  Where are my publications?  Where the rest are.  This week I didn‚Äôt have enough free time, I didn‚Äôt have the next idea, then for some reason I was postponed to a distant box.  But the subconscious was waiting for success.  I thought as follows: if I spent a certain amount of time on some work, then I must receive a certain return in return - some gratitude from fate and the gods.  Three or two followers or at least views.  Now, it seems to me that I have spent little effort to achieve this goal.  But the world already owes me, right?  What did I do not as a practice? <br><br>  I read and re-read the collections ‚Äú10 practical tips blah blah blah‚Äù, and ‚Äú5 qualities of a successful entrepreneur‚Äù and bitter stories of failures (you need to learn from others' mistakes) and sweet stories of success.  I even tried the power of visualization.  I visualized how I enjoyed the success achieved - money flows like a river, I saw this money, I could smell it and feel it with my own hands.  And then he returned to reality and it seemed to me that my cat was more successful than me. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9a5/711/2ed/9a57112ed70c4a7da8f4c897d100ed40.jpeg"><br><br>  In general, what did I want to say?  My ‚Äúbrilliant‚Äù project and me were ruined by the feeling that success was guaranteed to me, although nothing was promised to me.  And it is clear that with such a site and such content, I would not have reached world heights, but I could have a parochial site and an average and stable income.  The starting point to failure is its beginning.  All the trouble initially lay in me, as in many other people who try and fail.  But what is it?  The problem of generation, the problem of worship or just someone created to change the world, and someone to change with him? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300690/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300690/</a></p>
