Over time, you will see many such extensions.  The team currently offers one such demo extension - <u>Background Info Extension (BGInfo).</u> </p><br><br><p> <u><a href=""><img title="clip_image001" alt="clip_image001" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/089/250/df1/089250df17c6e6948c4afe195202c499.jpg" width="640" height="171"></a></u> </p><br><br><p>  BGInfo is an extension for VM Agent that allows you to display useful information about a virtual machine on the desktop when connected to it via RDP.  This information allows you to quickly obtain information about the settings and configuration of the machine. </p><br><br><h3>  HDInsight service update (Hadoop clusters on request) </h3><br><p>  HDInsight - a cloud-based 100% -compatible implementation of the Windows Azure-based Hadoop ecosystem has received another update. </p><br><br><p>  Now users of Windows Azure HDInsight are available for deployment on demand clusters based on Hadoop 2.2.  The new version offers an order of magnitude increased responsiveness (up to 40x) for requests, data compression (up to 80%) to reduce storage requirements, support and all the <a href="http://hortonworks.com/labs/yarn/">benefits of YARN</a> . </p><br><br><p> To start working with HDInsight clusters, you can visit our portal <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/ru-ru/jj712656">AzureHub.ru</a> or official documentation at the <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/documentation/articles/hdinsight-get-started-30">following link</a> . </p><br><br><h3>  Upgrade Java Development Tools for Windows Azure </h3><br><p>  Microsoft Open Technologies <a href="http://msopentech.com/blog/2014/02/10/february-updates-windows-azure-toolkit-eclipse-ssl-support-plus-new-jdks-windows-azure-configurations/">announced the</a> release of the February update of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/hh694271.aspx">Windows Azure Toolkit for Eclipse</a> tools, which are a set of tools with integration into Eclipse for the development of Java applications to place them in the cloud environment of Windows Azure. </p><br><br><p>  This release introduces the following innovations and updates: support for SSL and SSL offloading, enhanced support for the latest versions of GlasFish and Azul Zulu OpenJDK, a new option for selecting instances of A5 roles, a choice of Windows Server 2012 R2, improvements in the menu and new options. </p><br><br><p>  Details can be found in <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/microsoft/blog/212209/">this article</a> on Habr√©. </p><br><br><h3>  New management and monitoring features </h3><br><p>  The administration, management and monitoring functions of Windows Azure are constantly evolving and improving.  In February, several useful innovations were made. </p><br><br><p>  <strong>Notifications of platform crashes on the portal</strong> .  Unfortunately, on the Windows Azure platform is rare, but some services fail.  To improve the understanding and timely inform customers of such situations, support for real-time crash notification was added to the Windows Azure portal. </p><br><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c70/5b5/1c4/c705b51c45aa43868ed21d8b35120ced.png"></p><br><br><p>  Now users will receive notifications about failures in the work of the services they use directly on the portal: </p><br><br><ul><li>  notification of degradation of quality and performance </li><li>  partial unavailability of services </li><li>  total performance degradation </li><li>  total unavailability of services </li><li>  notifications from the security control service </li></ul><br><p>  Along with the notification, users are provided with real-time detailed information about the incident: </p><br><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bbe/c43/ddc/bbec43ddc7337a257a2adac588fc39d9.png"></p><br><br><p>  <strong>Increase the limit on the number of co-administrators</strong> .  Previously, Windows Azure account administrators could create up to 10 co-administrators who were given the rights to manage cloud capacity as part of a subscription.  However, the restriction of only 10 co-administrators did not suit many users. </p><br><br><p>  With the February update, the limit on the number of co-administrators has been increased from 10 to 200 for each subscription.  This will allow more efficient work with the power of one subscription to large development teams. </p><br><br><p>  <strong>New PowerShell cmdlets</strong> .  Administration tools via the command line and Windows Azure PowerShell scripts are constantly updated with support for the latest platform features. </p><br><br><p>  The new version of Windows Azure PowerShell offers dozens of new cmdlets that will allow you to work with new platform features: </p><br><br><ul><li>  Web Sites cmdlets with styling support, WebJobs, and others; </li><li>  cmdlets for virtual machines with support for extensions and others; </li><li>  cloud service cmdlets with support for extensions, static IP installations and others; </li><li>  storage cmdlets with metrics and logging support and others; </li><li>  ExpressRoute cmdlets. </li></ul><br><p>  A detailed list and description can be found <a href="https://github.com/WindowsAzure/azure-sdk-tools/releases/tag/v0.7.3-February2014">on the GiHub page of</a> this open toolbox. </p><br><br><h3>  Windows Azure Active Directory innovations </h3><br><p>  <strong>Expansion of the SaaS Solutions Catalog</strong> .  The directory of cloud SaaS solutions that are supported in Windows Azure Active Directory has been extended to 600 applications to provide the Single Sign-On (SSO) feature.  Let me remind you that among them are such popular services as Box, Google Aps, Dynamics CRM, Office 365, Citrix services and many others. </p><br><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9cb/56c/975/9cb56c9758a3eef6eceedd5ef58bc8df.png"></p><br><br><p>  With Windows Azure Active Directory and the directory provided, you can easily integrate single sign-on with your Microsoft services and third-party services through a single account. </p><br><br><p>  <strong>Premium mode and reporting</strong> .  For large corporate clients, Windows Azure Active Directory provides a new <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/ad/archive/2013/11/21/app-access-enhancements-ga-azure-ad-premium-preview.aspx">Premium mode</a> .  In February, for users of the Premium mode, additional reporting functionality was introduced that helps to better understand the consumption of third-party services and access to them within the company. </p><br><br><p>  Reports for premium subscribers are available on the Reports tab. </p><br><br><p>  <strong>Group management</strong> .  In February, users of a premium subscription to Windows Azure Active Directory were offered new self-management functionality for user groups. </p><br><br><p> <a href=""><img title="image" alt="image" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2a2/2ec/841/2a22ec84171d3cb475a24b82f0cd7f5c.png" width="624" height="243"></a> </p><br><br><p>  With the help of the new portal, not only administrators, but also ordinary users of the company will be able to create groups, find them, join and exclude their participation from groups. </p><br><br><p>  About these and other announcements of Windows Azure Active Directory can be found in the <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/ad/">blog of the development team</a> . </p><br><br><h3>  New BizTalk Services Cloud Service </h3><br><p>  Cloud implementation of some BizTalk server features - Windows Azure BizTalk Services has been updated. </p><br><br><p>  <strong>EDIFACT protocol support</strong> .  The cloud service now natively supports the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDIFACT">EDIFACT</a> protocol (United States / Electronic Data Interchange For Administration, Commerce and Transport) - an international standard for messaging. </p><br><br><p>  <strong>Support message bus service bus</strong> .  BizTalk Services can now easily be integrated with the Windows Azure Service Bus cloud messaging service, queues and topics.
