  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why do work well? Quality Manifesto</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h5>  Dmitry Nekki, CEO of Nekki, shared his thoughts on why some people do a good job, even when no one sees it, while others act carelessly, regardless of remuneration. </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/623/a80/be1/623a80be1f40923bf5787e620178a24d.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  What I write here is hard enough to understand, and even harder to explain.  Nevertheless, I believe that we all subconsciously know what we are talking about, and over time the meaning of the above will be revealed more and more fully. <br><br>  Many of the concepts that I use are not uniquely defined and allow for different interpretations.  Do not cling to the words - just try to feel what stands behind them. <br><br>  So, let's begin.  What I am going to talk about is what I call Quality.  Quality is not synonymous with correctness.  This is something more.  Properly done work is not yet work done qualitatively.  This is just a job that satisfies someone's rules.  And what if there is no one whose rules need to be followed? 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      For those who do not understand the difference, the question always arises: why do something above the rules?  Why do better than they ask me?  Why do you do something qualitatively that no one will see or appreciate?  Why do something for which I do not pay? <br><br>  No one can give a convincing answer to this question.  A response that would put everything in its place and give everyone enough motivation for Quality.  And when it is impossible to convince, it remains only to believe and choose with whom along the way.  For those with me along the way, I decided to write a manifesto. <br><br>  But first, a little theory. <br><br>  The most related concept of quality at the moment I consider the ancient Greek Arete.  This word was called excellence in anything, be it military, sport, art or knowledge.  Arete was closely associated with personal effectiveness and maximizing human potential.  I would venture to suggest that for the ancient Greeks Arete was the meaning of life. <br><br>  Therefore, returning to the question of why to act qualitatively, if one does not ask for it, one can give an answer: to act differently contradicts the meaning of life.  To do otherwise is to neglect one‚Äôs own capabilities.  To neglect the potential given to man when he came to this world. <br><br>  But how to achieve quality? <br><br>  Perhaps this question can not give a logical answer.  We found out that it‚Äôs not enough to just do the work according to the rules.  The manifestation of Quality, which can be described in words, automatically turns into rules, and we return to where we started. <br><br>  So Quality has another manifestation.  In addition to the logical, rational, there is also the second - the spiritual, romantic manifestation of quality.  That inexplicable, which inspires reverence for those who come into contact with it. <br><br>  Teaching Quality is impossible, but you can ask yourself questions: Do I love what I do?  Am I not ashamed of it?  Can I get inspired by my work and inspire others?  Did I make at least a small feat, did I get any better? <br><br>  And you can ask yourself: if I knew that this act would be the last in my life, would I do it the same way? <br><br>  There is much more to be said about Quality, but Quality is also in brevity.  Therefore, I will try to declare the main principles in the form of a short manifesto: <br><br>  Quality Manifesto <br><br><ul><li>  To do the job right is not to do it qualitatively; </li><li>  Make work Qualitatively more important than getting a reward for it; </li><li>  Work can be delegated, but it does not relieve from responsibility for its Quality; </li><li>  Responsibility for Quality is the honesty of a person towards himself; </li><li>  Quality has three enemies: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to do this‚Äù, ‚ÄúThis is not my job‚Äù and ‚ÄúI did everything I could‚Äù; </li><li>  Quality has three friends: inner peace, concentration on goals and confidence in success; </li><li>  Quality is not in perfectionism, but in harmony and efficiency; </li><li>  Quality does not know what is work and what is not.  It is in all deeds and actions; </li><li>  Whoever has realized Quality once, will strive for it always and in everything. </li></ul><br>  This is only my first attempt to come closer to an understanding of Quality.  I believe that this topic can and should be explored.  I hope that there will be more people in the world who care. <br><br>  To finish this article, I want a quote from the wonderful biography of Steve Jobs, written by Walter Isaacson: <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúHalf a century has passed, and this fence in the backyard of a house in Mountain View is worth it.</i>  <i>Showing him to me, Jobs stroked the pillars and recalled the lesson his father had taught him.</i>  <i>You need to carefully trim the back of the cabinet and fence, Paul taught.</i>  <i>It doesn't matter that they are out of sight.</i>  <i>‚ÄúHe liked to do everything well.</i>  <i>Even the fact that no one will ever see. "</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/142459/">https://habr.com/ru/post/142459/</a></p>
