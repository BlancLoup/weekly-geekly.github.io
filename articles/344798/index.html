There were no ‚ÄúIT specialists‚Äù, ‚Äúdesigners‚Äù, ‚Äújs-nicks‚Äù, and even ‚Äúprogers‚Äù - you were either on ‚Äúyou‚Äù with hardware, all the software and programming, or not.  The time is gone, specialization has come, salaries have grown, then again, and then multiplied by two.  And now we <s>are</s> so specialized that ... <br><br>  The author is from the old school.  For different reasons.  I like doing ‚Äúeverything‚Äù, helping myself and the company, and I look forward to a return - not only, and not so much financial.  I am constantly learning.  But not only my ‚Äúmain‚Äù, narrow specialty (= programming), which is paid for, and I will explain below why ... <br><br>  Recently, I ran into a problem known as ‚Äúre-learning‚Äù.  This happens when you reshape the job "in breadth", and the company can not use it in any way.  Then you break into startups, trying to express yourself, looking for options, talking to management (here I was lucky), or just leaving.

      Then I will try to summarize personal and known to me experience on this issue. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Those who suddenly recognize me from this publication</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Please do not show that you read this, because experience can help us all, and I have no offense to you. </div></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In general, ‚Äúretraining‚Äù is a known problem.  Usually it is ‚Äúvertical‚Äù - several people can apply for one position, hierarchically higher.  And when someone of them is chosen, to the detriment of others, the ‚Äúsecond nominee‚Äù - immediately, or after a couple of months, leaves.  Neither we, nor ‚Äî all the more so ‚Äî in the West are usually considered to be ‚Äúhorizontal‚Äù as a problem.  Previously, this was done in Japan, changing the work of a person in the horizontal plane once every 3-5 years.  They say that "space is being consumed." <br><br><h2>  <b>The most important thing: frames decide everything.</b> </h2><br>  The extent to which your product is cool, how other people belong to your business who do not know you, is very much dependent on employees.  There is a whole business psychological theory that you don‚Äôt want to focus on, but you know that they take people with a beautiful relaxing voice for technical support? <br><br>  For a week I was on interviews in two banks.  After the first, I wanted to run home and wash-wash-wash.  I do not know why.  It seemed that people hate each other (and me), but they tolerate it.  I don‚Äôt know for money or hopelessness.  Tolerate.  Leaving when I stretched my hand, it was unusual for them as if I were from another class.  This is bad. <br><br>  In the second, the whole procedure - from meeting to leaving - took 45 minutes, and I was ready to talk with them at least half a day, at least to the Red Army.  The people were so pleasant that I would close <i>almost</i> (diversification!) All my accounts in other banks and go to them, even if they did not take me.  They do not work for a brand, do not do PR - they do their job and they will not prevent me from doing my own - with them.  It's good. <br><br><h2>  Looking for people or professionals </h2><br>  The general trend is to hire professionals, and it is desirable that he was at least a good person.  Companies that take good people with a low level of professionalism - from hiring to closing run at sprint speeds, competing not only with each other, but also with the level of inflation in Zimbabwe.  Because they take as faithful, and ask how to smart.  There is no miracle of balance; a person must be both a person with whom you want to work and a professional of the required level.  In economics, there is the concept of ratings of companies (all kinds of "triple-hey", "double-bi", "substandard", etc.), and here it would be good to have a similar rating of people for an HR specialist and manager of directions.  Because one shit with the psychology of relations at the level of a substandard is ready every day "for the cause" to spoil the mood of all "triple-hey."  And if his salary is higher, because he is a great professional, then be sure to follow two rules. <br><br>  <b>First:</b> ‚ÄúLebedev's Rule‚Äù - no one inside the company should know how much the other gets.  Does not comply with your deputy - dismiss;  does not comply with the professional - dismiss;  You yourself have mentioned - from this moment nobody will work for you, they will receive a salary, but they will not.  Will carry out the written, but literally understood.  If a professional gets a lot, that's good.  If others know about it, they investigate, and not whether he is like a shit.  And if shit is at the speed of splitting molecules and atoms when a nuclear bomb detonates, your employees are no longer yours.  Look for their resume on the dating site with a new employer and never condemn them for it - they themselves broke firewood. <br><br>  <b>Second:</b> do not let him manage the team.  Let a qualified project manager communicate with people on the case.  All of his conjectures and thoughts "about the best" in the field of a product a professional should not inform people directly, but the manager.  The latter should say this to the others.  Humanly.  Believe me, when we arrived at this - the main part of the conflict was dissolved as a hedgehog with a jar of jam.  Do not forget, this is the future of your company, pay attention to it. <br><br><h2>  Professional man </h2><br>  Is it possible to find a good person and professional at the same time?  Of course available.  And not only find, but also quickly grow (about this in another publication, if it goes).  First of all, you need the unity of goals and maximum coverage of the interests of your employees.  This is an idea for a billion, and when companies start to implement it en masse, you will no longer be interested in politics, geography, or economics ‚Äî we will live in socialism and democracy at the same time.  I will explain.  No matter what happens with the company, it‚Äôs bad or good, if people can and want to use their current and future knowledge and skills in it, and receive profit from this that is sufficient for their life goals, the company will always live.  This is not "from the ceiling", there are such companies.  And the employees of these companies, when they see the director on the horizon, run to him and greet him.  Out of respect, to shake hands and say "thank you." <br><br>  It is important to clarify.  Business goals, such as ‚Äúwe will do the most awesome search engine‚Äù or ‚Äúthis will be the perfect way to deliver food, and you participate in it‚Äù - this is left to Americanized advertisers.  First, you lie to your employees.  Secondly, it is irrelevant.  People can kill for money, but they won't die for money.  People can work on a business goal, but no one will save a business that does not have anything for them.  Therefore, a clear adequate reason to work in this company is necessary.  I‚Äôll say right away that most companies have one reason and ‚Äúshould be‚Äù - to earn money.  Do not be afraid to say it, but do not become because of this cynical asshole.  Everything is normal - business is a story about money, and your employees will help you to achieve turnover and sales, and customers.  Just be with them. <br><br>  The idea for a billion - and I managed to meet this in at least one hefty company (in Russia, which is especially nice) - is that the manager, managing director, oriented ‚Äúinside‚Äù of the company, has a plan for employees - how to make money on them needs, and partly on Wishlist.  Apartments, cars, houses, children in the kindergarten, fly to Australia and Antarctica once a year.  If the director does not have such a plan not only in his thoughts, but also in his dreams - say hello to him, he does not understand either in money, or in management, or in life.  ‚ÄúMost likely‚Äù - because I don‚Äôt want to offend anyone, and personally you or your director are not like that, and you have a plan. <br><br>  The goal within the team that will help people come together is to realize the maximum amount of their interests and knowledge ‚Äúwithout departing from the cash register‚Äù.  No, not for nothing - we are training in capitalism.  Try to understand the background.  A person will work ‚Äúfor you‚Äù if you work ‚Äúfor him‚Äù.  He is ready to invest in you and your business some of his knowledge, and it is not part of his official duties.  His motivation is to change his life for the better.  His possible ways: either to do ‚Äúhis own‚Äù (a startup, a classic business, and other nonsense), or to sell to someone.  In Russia, a good idea will not be sold.  Let it gather dust, indulge pride and eat a little from the inside, but they will not sell it.  First of all, because we have not taken the idea to buy.  Steal - please.  Listen and reject - please.  Condemn - in five cases out of three.  And buy - God forbid, mind you, mind you!  "We are a business, or where?"  "We have been developing this for half a year."  "And how do you see yourself in this scheme?". <br><br><h2>  What to do </h2><br>  So, an employee with a golden head and an empty wallet wants to ride a Lexus in 2002 and live in a two-seater half an hour by subway from the center.  He comes up with how to outrun direct and indirect competitors or to get into another business altogether, reduce costs and increase cash flow, and is ready to do it during off-hours.  Himself, for your own.  You only guarantee that you will not throw it.  If you are ready for this, take initiative, draw up a contract, give it a share of your total subsidiary business.  You will become the head of the holding, and the employee will please your wife.  After this, you will receive from your people (now ‚Äúyour people‚Äù) so many ideas and results that you hire a special person to test them.  80% will be eliminated, and enthusiasm will only grow. <br><br>  Lyrics and socialism, yeah.  But if you think so, then you absolutely do not understand anything about capitalism and all these crowdsourcing and psychologies.  Not you, of course, you personally - you understand everything. <br><br><h2>  Why did the company lose me </h2><br>  By this time, I realized that I had already generally expressed what I wanted, and the details were useless.  But I know for sure at what point I thought about changing jobs, and what became the point of no return. <br><br>  Thought after the manager stopped listening to my - very careful - opinion in professional matters, because we had a professional.  When he appeared, I tried to convey to the management and the rest of the team that he (or rather, she) had a great talent in his profession.  After that, as an employee, I disappeared in the eyes of managers. <br><br>  The point of no return is the director's words that he sees me only as a programmer.  It so happened that I have 2 full-fledged education (high schools serious, full-time education), 3 large refresher courses (leading universities), thesis and continued study (for my money, if this is important) and I wanted to expand the range of application of forces, in breadth. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">A little about the specifics in different countries</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  I don‚Äôt want to offend anyone here - these are cases from life, they have nothing to do with politics. <br>  As a small digression from the topic.  In Russia, you can not have one specialization.  Because the other parties for you to cover no one.  For example, "A" fitter.  This can allow to withstand tactical fights - to feed the family, to buy shoes for his son to school.  On strategic spending - car-apartment-cottage-sapoginazimu And already thinking with fear and trembling.  If a person is a businessman and not bad with money, he urgently needs to be a FSB and a politician - otherwise work harder. <br><br>  In Germany, otherwise.  You have no right to repair anything, even insignificant ones.  You have no right to teach your children beyond the curriculum - if he knows more, then a direct way to a "non-standard" school.  And there does not share the "genius" or "autistic" - the main thing, not the average. <br>  In England, if you write a scientific work not in your specialty, but, say, working in biology, you bring in some arguments from biophysics, this is considered a gross violation.  There, specialization is developed to hypertrophic. <br></div></div><br>  If someone needs this, and the presentation style is pleasant to you, I can still tell (this time with references to sources) the opinion: why programmers do not know how to understand during the interview who they are - a professional or a person who has read;  how you can quickly understand it and make everyone happy;  and also why the average service life of a programmer in one place is 1.5-2 years and what to do in order to increase this period (flashback and prospectus - discard the mention of office cookies from the job description). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/344798/">https://habr.com/ru/post/344798/</a></p>
