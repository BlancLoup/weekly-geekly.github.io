      In 1970, the United States launched the first orbital X-ray observatory (previous experiments on X-ray radiation from celestial sources were carried out exclusively on suborbital rockets).  This device allowed us to study X-rays, opened a new cosmic observation window for humanity. <br><br>  In 1993, academician Li Tibei (李 惕 碚) proposed a project to create a telescope Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (HXMT, 硬 X 射线 调制 望远镜) with the goal of studying X-rays in a wide range (1 ~ 250 keV), studying the properties of black holes, physical laws under extreme conditions, supermassive black holes and other sources of high-energy radiation, as well as studying the properties of background X-rays.  By observing black holes, neutron stars, active galaxies, etc.  analyze the light curvature, properties of energy spectra, study the dynamics of high-energy radiation processes occurring under the influence of a strong gravitational field of black holes and other high-density space bodies. <br><br>  The total mass of the HXMT is 2700 kg., It is planned to launch the Great Trip-4B into a circular orbit with a carrier rocket.  Inclination of the orbit 43 °, altitude 550 km.  The telescope is designed for a four-year service life, has a fixed point observation mode, as well as a patrol mode.  The payload includes: a high-energy X-ray (HE) telescope, an average energy (ME) and a low-energy X-ray telescope (LE), and a space environment monitoring system (SEM).  Parameters (HE): NaI (Tl) and CsI (Na) scintillators, 20 ~ 250 keV.  Parameters (ME) Si-PIN 952 cm, 5 ~ 30 keV.  Parameters (LE): SCD 384 cm, 1 ~ 15 keV. <br><br>  In 2013, the HXMT project entered the final phase of device development.  After launch, the telescope should <br>  to carry out observations of hard x-rays with high sensitivity and high resolution, to detect new space bodies and phenomena of high-energy radiation.  The current scheduled launch date is the end of 2015.

In the international sphere, strong developed countries and regions equally invest a lot of human and material resources, develop practical and theoretical studies of the theory of quantum data transmission, prepare to conduct quantum data transfer experiments between an object in orbit and on Earth. <br><br>  In the past few years, the team led by Chinese academician Pan Dzyanvey (潘建伟) has been working in the field of quantum entanglement, quantum data transmission and quantum teleportation in free space, and get excellent international results.  They created a solid foundation for experimental verification of the theory of quantum communication at large distances and quantum mechanics. <br><br>  The QUESS task is to provide a platform for quantum data experiments over long distances, for the first time in history to generate quantum keys and to transfer between satellite and Earth at space distance.  The study of the problems of quantum theory and the verification of non-locality, have important scientific and practical goals, are designed to obtain noticeable results on the international arena in the field of studying the fundamentals of quantum mechanics. <br><br>  The total mass of the satellite is 620 kg.  They are going to output with the aid of the Great March-2D, it is supposed to work in a sun-synchronous orbit with a height of 600 km, an inclination of 97.79 °.  The planned duration of the satellite is 2 years.

Currently, mankind has planned the launch of more than 10 satellites to explore the space between the Earth and the Sun.  Their task is to study the factors influencing the formation of space weather.  These include the Observatory of Observations of the Sun and the Heliosphere (SOHO), the “Cluster” / “Double Star” projects (“簇” 计划 / “双星”).  However, the Kua-Fu project is the first satellite conducting simultaneous monitoring of space weather at the L1 point of the Earth-Sun and in the Earth’s orbit. <br><br>  The project is aimed at continuous monitoring of the formation of space weather in the Sun-Earth system, to study the process of transfer of matter and energy and their interaction.  Improve the accuracy of space weather forecasting and accelerate the study of the physics of the interaction of the sun with the Earth. <br><br>  Kua-fu is an international project, China is responsible for the satellite at Lagrange point L1 - Kua-fu-A.  The mission of foreign partners are the satellites Kua-fu-B1 and Kua-fu-B2.  Due to factors affecting the international economic environment that cannot be predicted, foreign partners have not yet implemented their part of the Qua-fu project.  Currently, the project is temporarily postponed. <br><br><h2>  Secondary scientific space projects </h2><br>  The main task of the secondary projects is to select from the already realized missions the ideas of the greatest scientific importance, and on their basis to make the preparatory work for the projects of the next five-year plan. <br><br>  In 2011, the following minor projects were selected: the group of small satellites “interaction of the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere” (MIT), the satellite “measuring the change of gamma radiation and its polarization” (XTP), the VLBI array of cosmic millimeter waves (SVLBI) and the telescope project for taking pictures in solar polar orbit (SPORT). <br><br>  In 2013, the following projects were selected: the Earth Planet Search Project (STEP), the space-based advanced solar observatory (ASO-S), the Einstein probe (EP) and the satellite for observing the global water circulation (WCOM). <br><hr><br>  I did not begin to do the translation of the description of minor projects. <br>  References: <br>  <a href="https://yadi.sk/i/9gpeVO6UettJA">The article itself in pdf (Kit, 2.6 MB)</a> <br>  There are also two interesting Chinese magazines, you can watch only the first few pages for free and provided you put them in the browser plugin: <br>  <a href="http://wuxizazhi.cnki.net/Wxpr/TKTS201501.html">Magazine "International Space"</a> <br>  <a href="http://wuxizazhi.cnki.net/Magazine/GJTK201501.html">Journal "Space Research"</a> <br>  Links for those who missed the articles on China's space program at Geek Times: <br>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/242621/">Chinese space program: own rover, space station by the end of the next five-year plan + heavy launch vehicle</a> <br>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/223427/">History of Chinese Astronautics</a> <br>  This is my first translation from Chinese, about errors and inaccuracies, please write in a personal. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/376889/">https://habr.com/ru/post/376889/</a></p>
