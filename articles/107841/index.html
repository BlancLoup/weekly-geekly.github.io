(in quotes) - PART 1</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="http://valerie-miles.com/artur/i/habr/good-great.jpg" alt="image" align="right">  My last article, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/arbeit/107549/">"Nude Business" by Richard Branson (in quotes)</a> , seemed to be interesting to many.  Well, let's not stop? <br><br>  Today, a few words about the book Jim Collins "From Good to Great."  This is probably the best book on business, among all that I read.  She truly deserves the right to be a desktop.  To some extent, it is not only about business.  Not only about how to build a successful stable company, how to recruit staff or manage projects.  First of all, she opens her eyes.  Both on business, and on life. <br><br>  I read this book 2 times.  The second time (now, as always) - with a marker, highlighting quotes.  Glad to share them.  I am sure that it will be interesting and useful for those who are familiar with the book to read these thoughts again.  And those who have not read the book, most likely will be convinced that it is definitely worth doing.

      *** <br><br>  <i>We studied and sifted through companies that were on the Fortune 500 from 1965 to 1999.</i>  <i>And they identified companies that managed to make the transition from good to outstanding results and maintain these high results for at least 15 years.</i>  <i>Then we analyzed the factors that allowed it.</i> <i><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br></i>  <i>***</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Those companies that managed to go from the category of "good" to the category of "great", according to our classification, and which we included in this study, achieved exceptional results - the average return on the shares of these companies for 15 years after their conversion to 6.9 times higher than the market average.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>***</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>We have compiled all printed materials about 28 companies over the past 5 years or even more.</i>  <i>Then we interviewed most of the CEOs of the companies who achieved outstanding results, who led the companies during the transformation period.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>***</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>It turned out that there is a negative correlation between the invitation of well-known outside managers and the outstanding performance of the company.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>***</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Companies that achieved outstanding results did not, in principle, focus on what to do to become great, they focused on what not to do, and on what to stop doing immediately.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>***</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Companies that made the transition from good to great, paid little attention to change management, employee motivation, or discipline.</i>  <i>With other components of the problem of responsibility, discipline, motivation, fear of change were resolved by themselves.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>***</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The process of transformation can be represented in the form of accumulation of potential and the following rapid growth;</i>  <i>The three main components of this process are: disciplined people, disciplined thinking, and disciplined actions.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>***</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>First ‚Äúwho‚Äù ... then ‚Äúwhat‚Äù.</i>  <i>It turned out that the leaders of great companies first select the people they need to travel, get rid of unnecessary people, ensure that the right people occupy the right places, and only then, sometimes jointly, decide, and where, in fact, they go.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>***</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>For the implementation of the final breakthrough, it is necessary that the company possesses key values, and a meaning that goes beyond the pursuit of profit.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>***</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>George Caine did not have charisma that could entice employees of the company, but he had something more effective - he was obsessed with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhigh quality work, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe highest standards.</i>  <i>He did not tolerate mediocrity in any form and did not tolerate those who believed that good was good enough.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>***</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>His rule - if you do not have the abilities that would allow you to become the best in your post, then you are guaranteed to lose your source of income.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>***</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Level 5 executives look in the mirror.</i>  <i>When they talk about responsibility and never write off their problems for bad luck.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>***</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Level 5 executives are incurably ‚Äúill‚Äù with the desire to achieve outstanding results.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>***</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>In fact, they said, ‚ÄúListen, I really do not know where to swim.</i>  <i>And all I know is that if the right people are on the ship, and they are in the right places, and they are left on the shore, then we will somehow figure out where to swim to get to where we will be well.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>***</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The right people do not need direct guidance or incentives;</i>  <i>for them enough self-motivation, due to the internal desire to achieve exceptional results and participate in the creation of something great.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>***</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>If you have the wrong people on board, then it doesn't matter if you can choose the right direction.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>***</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>If the leaders are ‚Äúright‚Äù, they will do everything in their power to achieve excellent results, and they will do it not for the sake of what they get for it, but simply because they cannot do otherwise.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>***</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Nucor fired people who did not adhere to internal work ethic.</i>  <i>The turnover at these enterprises in the first year reached 50%, but then dropped sharply.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>***</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The reward system was built on high bonuses paid to business units.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>***</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The best professionals do not have to worry about maintaining their workplace.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>***</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The only way to help people who achieve exceptional results is not to burden them with people who are not capable of it.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>***</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The first principle: if in doubt, do not hire, keep looking.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>***</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The second principle: when you know that you need to change people, act without delay.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>***</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>If you feel that someone has an urgent need for your leadership, this means that you have made a mistake in hiring.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>***</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>To allow people whose abilities do not meet the requirements to remain in the company is not fair to talented employees.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>***</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>How do you know what you know?</i>  <i>2 questions will help.</i>  <i>First, if you again had to decide whether to hire this employee (and not decide whether this employee should leave), would you hire him again?</i>  <i>Second, if this employee came to you and said that he was leaving, would you hold him back or would you secretly feel relieved?</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>***</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The third principle: give the best people the opportunity to work where you have the greatest opportunities, not the greatest problems.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>***</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>You need leaders who will discuss and argue, sometimes argue fiercely, in search of the best solutions, and on the other hand, implementing the decisions, will come out as a single team, regardless of differences of opinion and constitutional interests.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>***</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>If we spend most of the time with people whom we love and respect, with people whom we want to see around us and who will never disappoint us, we will surely have a wonderful life, regardless of what we do.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>***</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Is the person suitable for you, the question is rather his character and abilities, and not his knowledge, experience or education.</i> <i><br></i> <br><br>  The end of the 1st part. <br><br>  The second part: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/arbeit/108053/">http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/arbeit/108053/</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/107841/">https://habr.com/ru/post/107841/</a></p>
