  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Combine opposites to solve one problem</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  To achieve this or that goal it is always required to solve one or another tasks that will always be present.  When we talk about a goal, the definition of a task does not look like the question ‚ÄúThere is a task or not‚Äù, but ‚ÄúHow many tasks are there‚Äù.  This rule is fundamental and does not require proof, as an axiom in mathematics.  Always the notion of a goal must be matched with the notion of a task: a task ‚Üí a goal.  I will give a few examples for the visual application of this rule. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To listen to music, you need a playback tool.  Roller skating requires good roads.  To walk around the city at night, you need safety on the streets. <br><br>  All cases of the final goal are subjective, that is, they belong to a specific subject: a person, a spontaneous group of persons, or an organizational group.  They can be massive, but not all people or groups of individuals want to do the same.  The tasks to achieve these goals (listen to music, ride roller skates, take a walk in the street) are much more extensive and may be relevant not only for the above categories. <br><br>  That is why the union of the rock music lover and the hip-hop music lover is possible: together they can develop, or simply discuss, which headphones are the best today;  roller skaters will find a common language with ordinary pedestrians, solving the issue of quality and clean asphalt in the city, and lovers of night walks will speak the same language with those who, according to their own schedule, late return from work to make the city safe.  This principle of uniting people occurs quite often, but often it arises spontaneously and thoughtlessly.  If we take this question for control, we can see why the company‚Äôs mission is needed, how to unite class professionals, whose ideological prejudices would never have brought them together under other circumstances, and answer many other questions.

      Why did I come to this conclusion?  Perhaps, based on the fact that we are all selfish and always pursue initially the satisfaction of our needs.  But not everything in the modern world is as simple as the chain of desire ‚Üí goal.  According to the formula above, the element of ‚Äútask‚Äù must be present here: <b>desire ‚Üí task ‚Üí goal</b> . <br><br>  And the most difficult thing to satisfy the desire is to make the solution of the tasks as flexible and universal as possible for the maximum possible number of subjects.  Yes, I like rollerblading.  But I understand that this desire is present in not the largest number of city dwellers.  However, in order to improve the condition of the roads, I need to agitate not only and not so much fans of roller skates as ordinary citizens with the slogan ‚ÄúYou give quality asphalt to the city‚Äù.  That is, in my chain of <b>desire ‚Üí tasks ‚Üí goal,</b> my <b>desire</b> is skating on roller skates, my <i>task</i> (one of) is to update the coverage of city streets, and my final <b>goal</b> will be a new and high-quality asphalt. <br><br>  It is impossible not to agree with the opinion that arises when reading this proposal that it is all rather cumbersome (to combine those who have different tastes and needs), but only in this case can the needs of the maximum possible number of subjects be met. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/289162/">https://habr.com/ru/post/289162/</a></p>
