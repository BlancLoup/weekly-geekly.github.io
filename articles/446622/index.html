  <section class="page js-page"><h1>News at 11</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> On the street it was pouring like a bucket.  On all channels only and talk about gathering superstorm forces.  It must go one hundred kilometers to the north.  We will have a normal storm with flooded streets, torn power lines and fallen trees. <br>  I did the usual things.  He worked in the morning, then all day he cut over the desert in a military drone.  Shot down an enemy drone and zasekinil five hours of military service. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Satisfied went out onto the balcony, giving the world his royal majesty.  No one, of course, had any business, but I really need at least some kind of reward.  Came back home.  I took paper towels in one hand and a TV remote control in the other: <br>  - Call Lee Love. <br>  Audio connected first. <br>  - Andrei, are you?  Hey.  Today is a full hour earlier. <br>  - You have time? <br>  - Just a minute.  I'm not at all dressed. <br>  - Good.  Just do not forget about the lens. <br>  She sighed: <br>  - From them eyes so hurt.  We agreed through once. <br>  - And the last time ... <br>  - I was in them.  Do you not remember at all? <br>  - Right.  I'm sorry. <br>  A minute later the video turned on.  Lee Love sat in bed, dressed in a translucent white dress.  Bright scarlet lipstick on thin lips, flawlessly straight black hair and slightly slanted Asian eyes of the same color. <br>  - How are you?  She asked coquettishly. <br>  - Today shot down the enemy drone. <br>  - Cool tell me how it was, I'm terribly interested. <br>  - And I wonder what's under your dress. <br>  She smiled: <br>  ‚ÄúEverything under my dress belongs to you.‚Äù <br>  She took several seductive poses, then deftly pulled off her pink panties, leaving them to hang on one leg.  Lee Love knows how to drive me.  She came close to the camera and lowered it slightly to get a silicone dildo in the frame.  I looked at her thin fingers, at the movements of the lips, but most of all I wanted to see her eyes. <br>  - Look at me.  Look at me. <br>  And she looked.  A minute, two, three ... It seemed to me that I was close, but it was not so.  Just a few minutes of unsuccessful effort.  Finally, I'm sick of: <br>  - Dress the damn lenses, please.  Just for a minute. <br>  - Good. <br>  She pulled a flat blue box out of the bedside table.  Moistened the lenses in the solution and sat opposite the mirror and carefully put them on.  After a moment, two blue eyes with catlike pupils looked at me. <br>  - Yes, finally.  Come here soon. <br>  Her eyes were hypnotized, penetrated the consciousness and forced to believe: what she does, she does only for you.  I felt her slender fingers, her lips, her tongue, and light teeth biting ... oh no, no, not just now ... oh, no!  Oh yeah! <br>  Lee Love kissed the camera.  On the glass left a trace of lipstick. <br>  - I hope you enjoyed it. <br>  - Yes thank you. <br>  Lee Love turned off, and I sat for a long time, imagining blue cat eyes.  From the trance brought the sound of a new message. <br><br>  "Dear friend, <br>  I have a suggestion for you.  Of course, you are not one of those ... well, if not.  Because I do not see anything criminal in what I do.  Unlike those hypocrites who look down on people like you and me.  But we show them that we are strong.  That we can achieve our goals despite their hatred.  This is a blue ocean. <br>  I asked many authoritative machine learning specialists, but they rejected my proposal.  OK, I don't care.  We live in a free world where people like you can work better than some arrogant idiots. <br>  We need to meet and talk about the business in person.  I'll tell you what.  I can‚Äôt offer a lot of money right now, but believe me, together we make millions.  This is a blue ocean, my friend.  Come to Glitch at 9 PM. ‚Äù <br><br>  Seemingly ordinary spam, I get such offers every day.  If not for one word: ‚ÄúGlitch‚Äù. <br>  ‚ÄúGlitch‚Äù is a strange place.  Any institution is trying to attract customers.  Competition.  The war for a passable place, promotion in social networks, tourist applications, search engines and in real life.  Push your elbows harder and you will be noticed.  ‚ÄúGlitch‚Äù, on the contrary, is constantly hiding.  No mention on the public Internet.  You can reach it only through the onion servers.  But here the curious are waiting for difficulties.  The spontaneous change of mirrors leads to the fact that link collectors produce outdated info.  Only a well-trained sniffer can catch the disappearing trail on the network.  The mirror contains information about the location of the IRL and the access code.  IRL also changes, but not so often.  Reality is slow. <br>  If the author of the letter knows how to find ‚ÄúGlitch‚Äù, then he is not just a spammer. <br>  ***** <br>  Yes, ‚ÄúGlitch‚Äù is an institution for its own.  Inside nostalgic vaporized sound.  Happy consumers are smiling from the posters.  Old TVs broadcast news: ‚ÄúDesert Storm‚Äù and a riot in Los Angeles, a burning white house in Moscow and September 11th, the Fukushima accident and the bombing of Syria.  An endless chain of disasters in an atmosphere of comfort and safety.  As if you were staring at pictures on TV in childhood, waiting for the next Pokemon series. <br>  There are three visitors.  A couple at the table.  Belle pointedly doesn't notice me.  She drags in ‚ÄúGlitch‚Äù a new boyfriend every week.  All of them can hardly keep up the conversation about the weather.  About real topics you can not even stutter.  Belle likes these.  ‚ÄúGlitch‚Äù is one of the first Darknet bars, so getting here is still a privilege, but Bel breaks the rules, and she doesn't care. <br>  ‚ÄúOnce you bring a monkey here and say that she herself has found her way,‚Äù Jos√©, the owner of the institution, complains. <br>  - They are so cute, disappearing species.  Like Neanderthals, Belle smiles. <br>  Belle and her boyfriend are too busy with each other to pay attention to me.  Yes, and I'm more interested in the third person sitting at a far table between a palm tree in a tub and a pink flamingo.  He wears heart-shaped glasses and a T-shirt with a cover of the News at 11 album. He has an idiotic tourist smile on his face.  Such white and even teeth are only in advertising.  In the legs of an old-fashioned black case. <br>  That is how I saw Mike, a cheerful guy, who soars in his crazy world.  He got out of the table and rushed to shake my hand: <br>  - I knew you will come.  I knew it.  They say, they care about their reputation.  Bullshit they just too afraid to act.  They always hesitate.  But you aren‚Äôt <br>  I shrugged, not really developing my position.  Let's see what he says. <br>  - What are you going to order?  - asked Jose, as soon as we sat down at the table.  He knew that I loved Blue Dream, so he turned to the guest. <br>  ‚ÄúJust bear,‚Äù said Mike casually. <br>  - Friend, are you sure you came to the address?  Maybe you still bring a burger? <br>  The guest laughed, his mouth wide open.  His innocent, infectious laughter had an effect on Jose, like a red rag on a bull.  He began to breathe heavily, picking up the most offensive expressions in his mind.  Jose hates tourists.  Can break in and throw out.  And go then complain about the unfair attitude. <br>  - Give him the same as me. <br>  You could not intervene for a stranger, see how Jose deal with him.  But the guy looked harmless. <br>  Jose looked at me with his stubborn eyes, turned around and walked to the bar. <br>  ‚ÄúYour mother, a week has not passed, but already a rod,‚Äù he said, not caring much whether they heard it or not. <br>  The tourist showed his thumb: <br>  - Perfect, man.  You need just a little promotion.  People would love this place. <br>  ‚ÄúFuck you,‚Äù said Jose, charging the bong, ‚Äúthe roof has completely slid off. <br>  ‚ÄúSo tell me your name and your story,‚Äù I said. <br>  ‚ÄúMike,‚Äù he said briefly.  - I want to go straight for the humanity. <br>  Kais was on the table.  Two clicks, and I opened its contents: a few cylindrical devices.  Plastic hrenoviny incomprehensible destination.  I took one, the one that was transparent.  Inside two loops with beads.  From the end of the silicone tube with a hole in the form of lips. <br>  - What is it?  - I asked, although I already realized that I was holding a toy from the sex shop. <br>  - Don't you see?  - smiled Mike. <br>  - I hope it's brand new? <br>  "I've tried them just a couple of times," he answered in his carefree tone and leaned back in his chair, "and you know what, we can do better than this." <br>  I had the dark doorways, lonely passers-by, to whom we pestered with the proposal to suck off the top ten, but of course Mike did not mean this. <br>  - Do you wanna make machine like this?  - I asked, putting the thing back in the case.  The other did not take.  Blew black hair off the table. <br>  - Better!  I wanna do better than this stupid electric device.  I need to be like that. <br>  I explained to Mike that I have nothing against his idea, but I myself would prefer to do something more interesting.  He nodded intently, listening to me, and then delivered his speech.  Summary: The world is full of people who for various reasons do not have a sexual partner: disability, lack of free time, banal constraint, in the end.  Many people use their hands and feel guilty because they satisfy themselves ... which can be a big sign of a loser in modern society.  They turn to technology for help, but what can we offer?  Clumsy mechanisms that make you even more worthless.  After all, you used stupid machine. <br>  You will say why not bring a live woman or a man to your house.  The oldest profession is nowhere to go.  This is where the financial argument comes into play.  I feel sorry for the girl, who for some reason agreed to do work, which not a damn thing can do.  She chokes on saliva, bites and chokes, and both of you dream that it will end soon.  Again, sheer disappointment, instead of pleasure.  To get quality service from a professional, you need to roll off at least a hundred ... at a time. <br>  ‚ÄúI have a dream,‚Äù Mike finished.  He was standing in the middle of the house, with a cylinder of case in each hand, - I‚Äôve taken a dream.  Find peace and peace. <br>  There was silence in Glitche.  And then the big man Belle had dragged pushed the chair back and stood up. <br>  - I do not understand, he wants to make a jerk?  Yes, I love you now ... <br>  Mike was pretty quick in the air.  His toys fell to the floor.  Drugan Bel trampled on their heel like huge bugs. <br>  ‚ÄúStop it,‚Äù Belle ordered him, but he was already off the coils.  In my head a short video with a derailed train was scrolling. <br>  - I'll get your teeth out now.  Himself you will suck, freak.  - the big guy typed Mike into the wall and raised his chopped rough fist over his head. <br>  He was stopped by the sound of a shotgun reload.  Jose stood behind the bar.  The barrel of the hard drive is directed to the head of Belle's boyfriend.  He responded and smiled and nodded toward Mike. <br>  - You shoot me, he'll hook him too. <br>  ‚ÄúI don't care,‚Äù Jose said calmly.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like you both.‚Äù <br>  Belle stepped between them. <br>  - Take the barrel.  And you put the man in place.  We are leaving. <br>  This time, the hulk listened. Bel came to me so close that I could smell her skin.  In the pants instantly became cramped.  I looked at the blue eyes with cat pupils: <br>  - Andrei, what do you want? <br>  - Nothing.  I have a meeting here. <br>  She sighed and followed her boyfriend Neanderthal. <br>  - Do you really want to experience this?  - asked Jose, hiding the weapon back under the rack. <br>  ‚ÄúThat's what I mean,‚Äù replied Mike, examining the wreckage of the cars, ‚Äúshit,‚Äú A-class ‚Äùwasn't that bad actually. <br>  But after a couple of seconds, he smiled again, as if nothing had happened. <br>  ***** <br>  I started preparing the data the next day.  Mike is a normal guy, albeit moved on his subject.  He said that he received refusals in a different form.  Some sought to leave quickly, worrying about their reputation.  Others laughed, others were offended, but no one took him seriously. <br>  Marking the lip movements in the next video, I was thinking about my reputation.  Of course, I'm just a freelancer and I can do the work anonymously.  But still, how would customers react, knowing what I'm doing now? <br>  Six hours of porn with a break for lunch and ... well ... all the same porn.  I could not resist.  By the way, after it became easier to abstract and the work went faster. <br>  I noticed a few patterns.  For example, male actors work in a completely different way than women.  I had to call Mike and ask if our product was designed for gay men. <br>  ‚ÄúWell, maybe later,‚Äù he answered, ‚Äúbut we start from the wider audience.‚Äù <br>  Frankly, gay porn disgusts me, so I gladly removed it from the sample. <br>  Then it turned out that each actress has its own set of standard movements, usually three or four, so it‚Äôs enough to watch two or three videos to create a complete markup.  I again called Mike to ask him on what basis he selected the videos that he sent to me and if I could change the sample. <br>  - Oh, it is just my personal collection.  Started from high school.  Feel free to change selection as you like. <br>  I have no preferences in porn, so I started searching through lists like: 100 oral pleasures of all times, 100 best blow jobs of the year, Banana reward nominees, Deep Throat reward and so on. <br>  At the top of all the lists stood one name: Jessica Bright. <br>  ‚ÄúThere are people who do the impossible.  Jessica is one of them. ‚Äù <br>  ‚ÄúI worked with her on Survival Sex.‚Äù  The first three times I missed half a minute no more. ‚Äù <br>  ‚ÄúShe can play with you, and can cruelly fuck.  In any case, she is gorgeous. " <br>  After reading the reviews, I snapped my fingers with an excitement and clicked on the image of the blonde angel.  At first I tried to count patterns, but she did something incredible.  I quickly lost count and only fascinated by watching her art. <br>  The pants became warm and wet.  The video continued, and I sat stupidly looking in front of me.  I am thirty two years old.  And I have seen enough porn to treat it as an entertainment for schoolchildren.  "It is impossible to surprise me," I thought.  All because I did not see Jessica. <br>  I got to the toilet, wiped away the traces of my first meeting with her and called Mike for the third time. <br>  ‚ÄúWe can't create anything like it,‚Äù I explained. <br>  - How many patterns you found?  Mike asked. <br>  - I don't know, man.  It's not about the patterns. <br>  - Looks like you just fell in love. <br>  - Bullshit!  She's just ... she's just ... the special one. <br>  - How many patterns? <br>  - Fuck you!  It's not about the patterns! <br>  I hung up, realizing that my work on Mike was over.  Whatever we create, this car will be a pitiful likeness of man.  For those who take advantage of it, it will not cause anything but disgust.  Now it is clear why so many people refused him.  Idiotic idea. <br>  The phone received a message from Mike: "Meet at Glitch, today 6 pm". <br>  **** <br>  Glitch has already moved.  Jose added a couple of ingenious algorithms.  I read about one of them a couple of weeks ago, and he came up with the second one, so I had to tinker.  Barely had time until six in the evening.  Mike sat inside, yawning.  A bong and three empty popcorn buckets stood next to it. <br>  ‚ÄúOh, it looks like I came too early,‚Äù he said, and laughed in a thick, smoky laugh. <br>  - Listen, I don‚Äôt think this is gonna work. <br>  Mike nodded and lowered his eyes.  I wanted to say a couple of encouraging words to him, but I just threw up my hands and turned around to leave.  The door did not open.  From behind came the drunken rasp of Jose. <br>  - You are certainly a regular customer, but if you come here to have fun, the institution will not stand the competition. <br>  - Sorry, Jos√©. <br>  I wanted to take a free table, but Mike waved his hand, inviting for his.  I did not refuse.  Mike is a great guy.  Maybe his crazy idea will work once, who knows. <br>  Mike laid out personal belongings on a popcorn bucket and went on the Internet.  He excitedly mumbled something under his breath and hurriedly wrote down the numbers on a piece of paper. <br>  - What are you doing? <br>  - Wait.  I need to calculate something. <br>  On each bucket, he wrote the results of his calculations and leaned back in his chair.  He looked absolutely happy. <br>  - Look at these numbers.  Their profits, that companies gained from their primitive devices. <br>  I looked at the numbers.  Millions of dollars. <br>  - You can check my calcs if youd like to.  People are buying those things and that's true.  One hundred percent true.  But they‚Äôre curious and excited.  I don‚Äôt really want to work. <br>  Puffs of smoke flowed around Mike like a triumphant statue of an ancient god. <br>  ***** <br>  I went back to work that evening.  Studied patterns of hundreds of the best porn actresses.  I did not set high goals for the first version.  The main thing is to run a prototype. <br>  For some, work is success, achievement, career.  For someone hard everyday need.  For someone the opportunity to feel their importance.  Surely there are many other reasons.  For me, work is meditation.  Endless focusing on a single point.  Labor, which cannot be seen and which cannot be quantified.  He is all conscious.  You can only see the result. <br>  I flew in this strange mathematical world, trying to grasp the answer, not for the sake of an answer, but for the sake of interest.  The real world faded into the background.  This happens with people who are passionate about the game.  The answer was hidden around the corner, then the next.  But I was getting closer closer every day and finally caught it.  All predictions came together, the likelihood surpassed.  Wow  That's what I did something!  I created a stable working algorithm that absorbed the life experience of many people. <br>  Looked around.  The pizza box tower was piled up on the table.  Coffee mugs surrounded my desk chair like mines.  A plant was hanging from the bookcase, the name of which I did not remember, but its pitiful look made it clear how seriously I fell out of reality.  Mike's stupid case in the corner.  Why did he give it to me? <br>  I cracked my joints as I got up from the chair.  He skillfully made his way between the circles, picking up one of them along the way.  He scooped up water and poured the dry ground of the plant.  He will not live for the first time.  On the table shortly strummed the phone.  I excavated it, incidentally bringing down a tower of cardboard boxes on the floor. <br>  Mike!  Just in time.  ‚ÄúMeet in Glitch at 6 pm‚Äù <br>  I even looked at the vent.  Did he spy on me?  As in that series of Jumble, where the pioneer taught the pioneer to smoke. <br>  Glitch by the time again changed the location.  I had to hunt him all day in the depths of Darknet.  I came at 6:15.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Being late in Glitche is not only a sign of bad taste, but also an indicator that you are not good enough. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Jos√© shook his head disapprovingly: </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúYou hand over the positions.‚Äù </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Mike was sitting at the table, surrounded by his toys. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Nearby was a pair of bongs.</font></font> How!<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How does he get here so early? </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Having noticed me, he again showed his white-toothed smile. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Come here. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I've got some good news. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He solemnly removed from the case a steel box with army engravings on the lid. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I stopped him, explained that I did not want to deal with public affairs. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Don't worry. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is kind of a vaporwave product.</font></font><br>    .        IRL  ,       .         .      : ‚Äú  ‚Äù.      .         .      , ,    , ,         -,  ,       .      . <br>             .       ,      ,       . <br> ‚Äî Are you sure, it would work for us? <br> ‚Äî Why not. You need to test it though. <br>    ,      .    ,     .    - ,   . ,         .       ,  ,     , ,    .        ,   - . <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- We are ready to allocate two million for business development if we provide a working prototype tomorrow morning. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In short, I ran home with a military development under my arm. I was worried, of course, although I knew exactly what would happen. Do not cling batteries to the first version. You can connect to the board with USB output. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The idea worked perfectly and soon the waves passed through the rings, squeezing and expanding them. I had to work all day to translate the work of the algorithms to the level of iron. I was urged to try the prototype, but when I finished, I was so tired that I just wanted to sleep. ‚ÄúDamn, you have to somehow force yourself,‚Äù I thought, and instantly fell asleep, dropping my head on the table.</font></font><br>  ***** <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Awakened by persistent meowing. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Wet cat poked at the balcony door on the other side. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On the street watered a particular rain. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The cat flew home, driven by a crash. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I glanced at my watch. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Half past nine in the evening. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On the phone message from Mike. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúMeet sponsors at 11 pm. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Plaza Hotel.</font></font><br>  Heck!<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I have an hour and a half to meet with sponsors at the opposite end of the city in the most expensive and pompous place. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Plaza Hotel, the exact opposite of ‚ÄúGlitch‚Äù. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Hundred-storey skyscraper in the sea, two kilometers from the coast. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It can be seen from anywhere in the city. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I jumped in a taxi, knowing that the decision would have to come up on the go. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There it is impossible to get there without an invitation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I could not even imagine what to do. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Who does he take me for?</font></font><br>    ‚Ä¶   -    ,     .        .

Well, yes, I will now present a jerking machine. It sounds not so cool, but they are not launching rockets into space? In short, I tried to cheer myself up as best I could. And yet I had a premonition that I would sound unconvincing ... </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- What are you selling? - I asked one of them. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Product. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Which one?</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Indulgence was replaced by tension. For them, I am an alien element, something like Belle's boyfriends in ‚ÄúGlitche‚Äù. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- We present ready-made solutions for business integration. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Just tell me what you sell? </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúAhhh,‚Äù he laughed nervously, ‚ÄúI understand.‚Äù You are interested in our product. We do not just sell, but also carry out a full cycle of support. Continuous feedback allows us to track customer satisfaction in a timely manner. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Just tell me, your mother, what are you selling? </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The guards were already hurrying to the meeting, but Mike suddenly appeared in front of them. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Don't worry, gentlemen, we just have some fun over here. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then, he friendly patted the businessman on the shoulder:</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- We are really interested in invest in your business. How about a dinner in Friday? </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The guy immediately relaxed. He and Mike were talking like that for the rest of the way, and I struggled with nausea. The ship was pretty rocky. A couple of times the floor went down so abruptly that my heart sank with fear. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Catamarans moored, we went to the tower of the Plaza Hotel. Mike said goodbye to the businessman as if they were best friends. High-speed elevator raised us to the presidential suite on the hundredth floor. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- How is it? Mike asked, intending to knock on the door. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then I remembered that I did not test the machine. It is a pity that it is too late to talk about it. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúAwesome,‚Äù I replied. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Mike nodded and knocked. The door was opened by an unshaven black man in a rapper outfit.</font></font><br> ‚Äî Finally. We waited for you my friend, ‚Äî     , ‚Äî You are our God of Fuck, fucking good god. Give me this thing. <br>       , ,    .        .   , , .  .          ,    .       ,       .       . <br> ‚Äî Who is this guy? ‚Äî   . <br> ‚Äî Dj, singer, music producer, something like this. He's trending on YouTube. Gained some fortune and wants to invest in technology. <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I didn‚Äôt really like to watch the work of my typewriter, so I took the unfinished bottle of champagne and went to the window. He winked at his reflection, then leaned against the glass to look at the storm raging over the city. Mike joined me. Lightning cut through the sky from horizon to horizon, snatching out of the dark swirling gloomy clouds. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The rising star of Youtube yelled, laughed and read the number with an animal roar. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- O my god! I came three times already! Can you believe it? This can be out of me. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I handed Mike a bottle. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Do you believe we really doing something important? Look around. This is just bullshit, nothing more. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Mike laughed at his ever-laid-back laugh. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- I don't know, man. Ask yourself, not me.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">From something I was not surprised at all. Only I was reflected in the window with the now empty bottle of champagne in my hand. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Oh, shit! Five times! Five times! Can you beat this, my dear subscribers? </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The man at the table closed the little book for the first time, and put it in his inner pocket. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúWe are ready to offer you a contract for five million instead of three,‚Äù he said, approaching me. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The lawyer was reflected in the window, but still did not want to talk to him. In the end, it's Mike's business, not mine. I nodded and approached the cold window again. The lights of the city went out one by one. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Something is wrong? The lawyer asked anxiously. - You looked ... hmm ... otherwise. Do you have any pain? </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúDo you think they will survive?‚Äù </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The lawyer approached the glass, put his palm with a visor:</font></font><br> ‚Äî  .      .      ?    .    ,    . <br>    . <br> ‚Äî    ? ‚Äî      ,           .     . <br>    : <br> ‚Äî      .     -. <br>      .            : <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Sure, we need to move. I want to fly straight to the moon. I really see huge perspective in our product. We expect great customer satisfaction. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On the threshold, I looked around and winked at myself: </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- I've talked with Jessica Bright lately. She begged me to arrange a meeting with you. She really likes techy guys. Come with us. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I grabbed the bottle off the table and ran it into Mike. She flew through it, hit the wall, but did not break, rolled on the floor, splashing out the contents. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- You're crazy? - the lawyer shouted, his eyes bulging ridiculously, - I offer you real money, moron.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He ran to the door. The second bottle shattered a waterfall of fragments. It seems enough to translate in vain expensive alcohol. I took the whiskey. He moved the chair closer to the window and sat down to watch the storm. How is Jose, how is Bel? That would be great to be in Glitzche. Listen to News at 11 and Jose's grumbling; admire belle's cat eyes. It is a pity that all this is in the past. Cracks ran across the thick impact-resistant glass. The time has come for me to become part of the news ... </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And suddenly I realized that I did not want to watch from the sidelines. Superstorm somehow will eat me. Why not have some fun at the end? </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I ran out of the presidential suite. ‚ÄúOut of service‚Äù was reported on all four elevators. He ran up the stairs to the roof, jumping over three steps.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The lawyer was halfway to the helicopter when I was on the roof. He covered his hands from the rain gushing in his face. When he noticed me, I was so close that he managed only to scream shortly. After receiving a blow to the jaw, the lawyer fell to his knees. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The helicopter has not yet unscrewed the screws. The pilot sat with his legs dangling from the edge of the platform and watched me move closer. Cigarette smoke escaped from under the closed palm </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Just don't touch me, okay? - He shouted through the wind and shot the bull into the howling darkness. The light instantly disappeared from view. - Where are you going? </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- There! - I pointed towards the city, plunged into darkness. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Moron. There is an epicenter. Fly there yourself. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- That's what I want. Stay here or fly with me. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The pilot pulled off his helmet and thrust it into my hands.</font></font><br> ‚Äî    .      . <br>         ,       .      .     ‚Ä¶       .             . ! <br>    ,       ,     .             . <br>               .    ,      .      ,     . <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Fifteen minutes I circled over the block in search of a place to land. Finally, he sat right in the middle of the street, breaking off the screws and knocking the car on its side. I managed to wonder why the street is completely empty. Do people still go home, waiting for the news? But there was no time to think. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I burst into the "Glitch", breathing heavily. Clothes got wet through, heart pounding from crazy doses of adrenaline. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Belle sat in a chair opposite the window, wrapped in a blanket. Near by on the table the flame of a candle trembled. She raised her lovely blue eyes with cat pupils on me. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Where is Jose? - I asked in such a tone as if I came here by chance. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">She shrugged and smiled. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúHe said he wanted to be alone.‚Äù</font></font> And you? <br>      ,  .      .       ,   . ,         . <br> ‚Äî        ,     .   -  ,       ,     ‚Ä¶ ,      . <br>    : <br> ‚Äî  ?   ? <br>  : <br> ‚Äî ,    . <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúNot the best lesson before the End of the World,‚Äù she put down the book, threw off the rug and stood up. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">She was out of clothes and her cat eyes glittered exactly as I had imagined countless times. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">She threw her arms and legs around me, pressed her whole body to me. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We will meet this End of the World ...</font></font></div>
