  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Wish conveyor</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  What do you think, if now everyone started a little amnesia and the MMM commercials would come out again, would the people go after Lenya Golubkov?  Everything is just as simple and unsophisticated - today you bring 100, in a week you take 200. Gold rush, the flow of trustful future deceived investors, total euphoria from freebies. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  But Leon Golubkov returned, but in a different guise.  How often do you see a gaming machine? .. No, not so - How often do you see a slot machine that is <b>not busy</b> ? <br><br>  What is the point?  In super profitable business?  No, because their money was carried in MMM far from businessmen.  Maybe it's in the original dream of Russian Emelya to lie on the stove while ‚Äúthe money is dripping‚Äù?  This is more like the truth, but why are people so easily influenced by fairy tales? <br><br>  Sporce any adult. Does he believe in the pike desire performer and the self-propelled stove?  Does not believe!  But someone carried the money to Golubkov-Mavrodi, and there was no idle time in slot machines.  What makes adults living the lives of people overnight children who believe in a miracle?

      <b>Tale is better than life.</b> <br><br>  That's how you live, you live, you don't see the light of white - during the day at work, in the evening at the TV, there is not enough money, the wife is sawing, and tomorrow will be the same. <br><br>  And here they appear.  You quickly realize that you are very clever, that money must spin, and there is a peasant yesterday, won - won 20 thousand at the machine.  And he spent something just a thousand.  But you're smart - you have a system! <br><br>  ... So how much did you win today?  200 rubles.  Good.  And lost?  1000. But what adrenaline!  Tomorrow you will get lucky - you know that. <br><br>  <b>Fairy Tale Merchants</b> <br><br>  <i>Yes, with such a machine you will be respected.</i>  <i>Here you will come up, lower the glass with a button, make a short pause, letting them look at you and envy, and with a baritone: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just waiting for a moment, the ambassador is waiting for me.‚Äù</i>  <i>Needless to say, with such a machine, you have a suit with a tint and without a single fold.</i>  <i>You are confident, calm and indulgent - they are small people, they can never make money on such a machine.</i>  <i>Of course, they have to forgive imperfections and not demand too much from them ... Oh, and here she is, who threw her top model career because of you, she knows that only you are a real man, reliable as a dam, with instant solutions to all her problems ... Jump on baby we hurry ....</i> <br><br>  brrr ... what was that?  Ads?  Wow, what quality advertising.  Hmm ... And what was advertised there?  Mercedes S600?  And how much does it cost?  Wow!  And in the minimum configuration?  Hmm ... work something to change? <br><br>  But the truth is, how much is your self-confidence?  Such condescension, majesty, quiet envy of others ... 60 thousand cu?  80?  And after all this price someone will pay.  The one who was successful, hardworking and hardworking.  Who counted the money, multiplied them and came up with clever schemes.  He worked so hard for years, it‚Äôs time to get everything from life.  And here they are with their tales.  Now his first goal - the very two tons of iron, glass and rubber.  In the same line will be a suit with a low tide, and a luxurious house and a young top model ... <br><br>  And advertisers drank champagne for the success of the action and went to write new concepts based on a new unsatisfied thirst.  Well, ka, who has not yet filled out a list of important purchases? <br><br>  Poor student?  You express yourself through a cool mobile phone with a camera and a player.  How not to 400 bucks?  Nothing you find. <br><br>  A housewife?  Your happiness - this kitchen set of 140 eternal knives (regular customers discount). <br><br>  A young couple?  How have you not bought an apartment?  We go to you ... <br><br>  This Advertising is something more complicated than an offer to sell.  This is first of all a new emotional world, which is more pleasant than reality.  There is no such reality that can not be overshadowed by advertising.  Advertising takes a long time for the living pleasure and comfort, greatness (of the viewer of course) and respect.  They will dig out your fears and sell you a remedy for them, find your complexes and fix the best way to cover them.  Do you have problems with the opposite sex?  - in your wallet already looks with a dozen transnational corporations. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWhich dishes express your inner world more precisely?‚Äù (C) Chuck Palahniuk </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/5108/">https://habr.com/ru/post/5108/</a></p>
