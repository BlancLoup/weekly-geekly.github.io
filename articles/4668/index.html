  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Gates with us</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The official goal of the recent visit of the head of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> to the capital was announced the presentation of the new version of the Windows operating system.  Gates' other goals manifested themselves during his meetings.  Thus, having finished his presentation at the seminar ‚ÄúInnovations and Information Technologies: Global Challenges, Opportunities and Success of Development‚Äù, Gates talked to First Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and the Minister of Information Technologies and Communications Leonid Reiman - without representatives of the press. <br><br>  According to <a href="http://www.rg.ru/2006/11/07/geits-anons.html">"Rossiyskaya Gazeta"</a> , they discussed the project of creating the Higher Technological School - this institution is called upon to become an international technological university.  ‚ÄúIt is very important for us that this university allow us to transfer the experience of the best Russian programmers in the world,‚Äù said Reiman.  According to him, there are no problems with project financing in the country - it is more important to be able to ensure the world level of teaching and management at the School.  The head of Microsoft replied that he was familiar with examples of successful implementation of such undertakings - in particular, on the basis of strategic partnership with leading American universities.  For his part, he ‚Äúpromised strategic development assistance‚Äù. <br><br>  At a meeting with Education Minister Andrei Fursenko, scholars and students, Bill Gates commended the national project ‚ÄúEducation‚Äù, namely, he found the positive intention to connect 52,000 schools to the Internet.  ‚ÄúTo connect all schools to the web is very good, very good,‚Äù he said.  ‚ÄúMicrosoft will do everything to make the software available to all of these schools.‚Äù

      According to <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/newspaper/article.shtml%3F2006/11/08/115419">Vedomosti</a> , young Russian scientists have shown Gates and Fursenko original software products in the field of education.  They asked Gates if he was leaving the business, to which he replied in the affirmative - he would do this to focus on educational projects.  The richest man on the planet is distressed by the fact that funding for scientific research is declining everywhere - commercial structures do not increase spending on science, and governments cut them altogether, since they spend less on defense.  ‚ÄúThis is one of the reasons that Gates is going to retire from Microsoft‚Äôs management in 2008 and take on the activities of his foundation,‚Äù confirms Felix Muchnick, chairman of the board of the Association of Independent Software Developers, who attended the meeting. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.html%3Fpath%3D/daily/2006/208/12798132.htm">Kommersant</a> reports that the head of Microsoft is worried about the state of things in the Russian software market.  Last year, Microsoft Rus earned $ 258 million in our country, and could have tripled more if the level of piracy on operating systems and utilities of a corporation fell from the current 80% to at least 50%.  According to Kommersant insiders, Gates proposed a specific anti-piracy method ‚Äî introducing the Digital Rights Menagement (DRM) technology as the national standard for protecting digital content, with which DRM fully controls the manipulation.  With the introduction of DRM, online stores will have to be equipped with systems that "encrypt" Microsoft-sold files.  In addition, all data on the circulation of these files will be transmitted to the single identification center of the company.  The systems themselves cost about $ 1 million each.  Another DRM component included in the new Windows Vista operating system will block reproduction of files that are not licensed by Microsoft on computers.  As a result, the newspaper reports, the user will have to pay for all media files and downloaded software. <br><br>  Gates talked about the future of mobile devices, saying that in the next 5-10 years, Microsoft will cross a PC, a music player, a mobile phone and a camera in one device.  Experiments in this area are already underway. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4668/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4668/</a></p>
