    <h3>  <font color="#0071c5">General Electric CEO, Jeff Immelt</font> </h3><br>  Every day, Jeff gets up at 5:30 am (for cardio training), then he meets the press and watches CNBC, as he told Fortune magazine.  According to him, for 24 years he has been working 100 hours a week. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Xerox Chief Executive Officer, Ursula Burns</font> </h3><br>  Yahoo Finance Ursula talked about her use of the early morning hours to get up to speed by looking through e-mail messages.  Getting up at 5:15, she sometimes works until midnight. <br><br>  Ursula also uses this time to stay in shape, leaving an hour of sports in her schedule (at 6 am twice a week - classes).  This is evidenced by Laura Vanderkam, the author of the article ‚ÄúWhat do the most successful people do before breakfast‚Äù. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">CEO of Chrysler and Fiat, Sergio Marchionne</font> </h3><br>  Marchionne distributes his time between Turin in Italy and Auburn Hills, Michigan. <br><br>  While in the US, he has to get up at 3:30 am to interact with European colleagues and, in addition, to leave time for everything else, he said in the TV show ‚Äú60 minutes‚Äù. <br><br>  ‚ÄúYou and I live today among workaholics.  I have never seen anyone like Sergio, ‚Äùsaid‚Äú car king ‚ÄùSteve Rattner.  When the weekend in Italy, Sergio comes to work in America.  And for the American weekend - going to work in Italy.  Saturdays and Sundays for him and for his whole team are just working days.  And anyone who went to work for Sergio signed up to participate in the program. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Co-founder of the investment company PIMCO, Bill Gross</font> </h3><br>  Managing the world's largest bond investment fund in California virtually guarantees early upsurges.  According to the Fortune edition, Gross wakes up at 4:30 to check the markets and gets to the office by 6. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Chief Executive Officer Square, Jack Dorsey</font> </h3><br>  Dorsey described his schedule to the magazine New York Magazine, announcing that at 5:30 he wakes up for meditation and jogging about 10 kilometers. <br><br>  He supported such a regime during the period when he moved between Square and Twitter, spending about 8 hours a day in each company. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Richard Branson, Founder and Chairman, Virgin Group</font> </h3><br>  Giving an interview to the author of the Business Insider online publication Ali Weisman, Branson discovered that his morning comes around 5:45, even when he is on his private island, forgetting to shut the windows so the sun wakes him up (about how Branson and others successful people spend their free time - <a href="https://megamozg.ru/company/testutor/blog/23928/">here</a> ). <br><br>  He tries hard to use these early hours to practice before an early breakfast and get to work. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">PepsiCo Chief Executive Officer, Indra Nuyi</font> </h3><br>  Getting up at Nooyi at 4 am, as she tells Fortune magazine: "They say that sleep is a gift that God gives you ... this is the only gift I have never received." <br><br>  In a series of speeches, she said that she came to work every day no later than 7 hours. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">GM CEO, Dan Akerson</font> </h3><br>  The Associated Press learned that Akerson "usually cannot sleep after 4:30 - 5," he wakes up to have the opportunity to talk with General Motors in Asia before evening arrives.  He believes that his work is the best of all: "It is complex, interesting, and exciting." <br><br>  But stress gets to him, leading to "many nights without sleep." <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Chief Executive Officer of Virgin America, David Kush</font> </h3><br>  Described by David for the Associated Press: getting up at 4:15, sending emails, talking on the phone with partners from the East Coast, and this is all before listening to Dallas sport radio, reading the press and exercising on the exercise bike. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Apple CEO Tim Cook</font> </h3><br>  Everyone knows Tim's ups and corporate e-mails at 4:30 in the morning (according to Ryan Tate, a Gawker correspondent).  At 5 he is already training in the gym.  And he works late, proud that he comes to the office first, and leaves last. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Disney Chief Executive Officer, Bob Iger</font> </h3><br>  Iger told the New York Times that he was getting up at 4:30.  Every morning.  It takes him a quiet time to do a number of things: read newspapers, do exercises, listen to music, study e-mail and watch TV ‚Äî all at once.  And although this is a fairly quiet time, he ‚Äúhas already entered multitasking mode of operation.‚Äù <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Chief Executive Officer Hain Celestial Group, Irwin Simon</font> </h3><br>  Simon gets up at 5 o'clock in the morning and immediately gets to work, looking at e-mail or making calls to Europe and Asia.  In addition, he prays, walks with the dog and does exercises before his children wake up, often planning to meet at breakfast before arriving at his office on Long Island by 9 am. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI have always been a morning person.  As you can see, I do a lot in four hours and now I feel ready for the rest of the day, ‚ÄùSimon told the National Post, adding that he works 75 to 100 hours a week, managing companies under brands like Rice Dreams and Celestial Seasonings. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Former CEO of Peugeot, Jean-Martin Volz</font> </h3><br>  It was said that the former head of Peugeot, who now heads the board of satellite communications operator Eutelsat Communications, could catch a train at 4 am from Dijon to Paris and finish viewing reference documents a few minutes before arriving at his office at 7 o'clock.  According to The Guardian, Foltz also converted his Renault Espace into an office to work while traveling. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Starbucks CEO, Howard Schultz</font> </h3><br>  ‚ÄúI get up at 4:30 every morning to walk my three dogs and warm up.  Around 5:45, I make coffee for myself and my wife, using a Bodum french press for 8 cups, ‚Äùsaid Schulz at Bloomberg Businessweek. <br>  According to Portfolio.com., The coffee magnate gets to the office by 6 am. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Executive Director Brooklyn Nets, Brett Jormark</font> </h3><br>  The youngest NBA CEO told SellingPower that he got up at 3:30 in the morning to get to the office by 4:30.  There he designs and sends motivational emails to his team. <br>  On weekends, he is not so zealous, arriving at the office by 7 in the morning. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Former CEO of the Oxygen Channel, Jerry Layborn</font> </h3><br>  The founder of the Oxygen channel at 6 am is already on his feet, and after half an hour he leaves the house.  If you get up early enough, she may even take you under her wing, she says Yahoo!  Finance: <br><br>  ‚ÄúOnce or twice a week I go for a walk to Central Park with a young boy or girl who needs my advice.  This is my way to contribute to the development of the next generation.  And if someone gets up early in the morning, then they are serious about life.  I can‚Äôt take time in the office for this, but such meetings in the morning allow me to play sports and at the same time stay in touch with young people. ‚Äù <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Cedar Fair Entertainment CEO Matt Uymet</font> </h3><br>  Uymet loves to come to the office early, getting up at 5:30, so that by 6 in the morning he leaves the house. <br>  ‚ÄúI was always worried about the arrival time at work: this is working time,‚Äù he told Yahoo Finance. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Cisco Technical Director, Padmashri Warrior</font> </h3><br>  After getting up at 4:30 in the morning, Warrior spends an hour on email, reads news, plays sports, and prepares his son for school. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Procter &amp; Gamble CEO, Alan Lafley</font> </h3><br>  The head of Proctor &amp; Gamble, who after the break again took up work, told Fortune that he was in the habit of getting up between 5 and 5:30 am  This is done to be at the desk by 6:30 or 7. <br>  He also takes care of a good breakfast: ‚ÄúBefore, I almost did not eat anything for breakfast.  Now I have V-8 juice for breakfast, half a bagel and a cup of yogurt.  And I eat five or six times a day.  This is the question of managing your glycemic index.  You do not want him jumps? " <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Unilever CEO, Paul Polman</font> </h3><br>  Dutch by birth, Polman gets up at 6 am to work on a treadmill in his office.  It also gives him time to ‚Äúreflect on the upcoming working day,‚Äù which is probably quite restless in a multinational company, among which brands are food, cosmetic and hygiene products. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">AOL CEO Tim Armstrong</font> </h3><br>  ‚ÄúI usually get up at 5 or 5:15 am,‚Äù Armstrong told The Guardian.  ‚ÄúEarlier, I preferred to start sending email when I woke up.  But not everyone lives with me in the same schedule, so I tried to wait until 7 in the morning.  Before working with e-mail I train, read and use our products.  By 7 am I usually have questions or feedback on AOL.  I am not a great sleep and I have never been.  Life is too exciting to sleep. ‚Äù <br><br>  He says that he is trying to get six hours of night sleep, but often wakes up earlier.  "This is not perfect," he admitted. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">CEO Newton Investment, Helena Morrissey</font> </h3><br>  Morrissey told The Guardian that she gets up "at 5 am, sometimes even earlier," and immediately starts sending out e-mail before her children get up.  And at 7:30 pm, Helena has a family dinner, but after that she works again, sometimes for at least two hours, preparing for the meetings scheduled for the next day. <br><br>  She admits that she feels a little lack of sleep.  But this is a job, especially when you have nine children in addition to managing a global investment company ... <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">General Motors CEO, Mary Barra</font> </h3><br>  Barra, who replaced CEO Dan Akerson, spent her whole life working for GM and became the first woman manager of a large automotive company. <br><br>  She is already in the office when many people are still just waking up, as a rule, by 6 am (according to the New York Times). <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Starwood Hotels CEO, Fritz Van Paaschen</font> </h3><br>  Former CEO Coors is on the list of habits for jogging or cycling at 5:50 in the morning and ready for the upcoming day at 6.30.  According to the Associated Press, he is probably America‚Äôs most athletic CEO (completed his first Ironman triathlon in 2013 in 12 hours and 44 minutes). <br><br>  This is the achievement that helped him succeed.  One of the three life lessons he shared with Bloomberg Businessweek is that ‚Äúeffort is more important than talent.‚Äù  Another great lesson is: ‚ÄúEveryone who believes that he is a man who has made himself has a very selective memory.‚Äù <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Former PepsiCo CEO Stephen Rinemund</font> </h3><br>  When he ran PepsiCo, this marine veteran ran 6.5 kilometers every morning at 5 o'clock (according to CEO.com).  It was the only way to make time for jogging, without getting bogged down in corporate affairs.  He also got into the habit of reading The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Financial Times and The Dallas Morning News before going to work. <br><br>  As dean of the Wake Forest University business school, Rheinemund invited students and teachers to join him in his morning jogging called Dawn with the Dean (according to the Business Journal). <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Vogue editor in chief, Anna Wintour</font> </h3><br>  An unusually obstinate icon of the ‚Äúglossy‚Äù fashion wakes up every morning at 5:45 to play tennis an hour (according to The Guardian).  After that, at 6:45, she begins her daily work with hair in order to preserve her famous hairstyle. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Former Presidents, George W. Bush and George W. Bush</font> </h3><br>  The first Bush got up at 4 am, went for a run, was in the office by 6 o'clock and went to bed at 2 am.  ‚ÄúIt was terrifying,‚Äù said a former White House nurse who should have tried to support him. <br><br>  The second Bush retained a similar schedule, coming to the office by 6:45 and often holding meetings at the same hour (according to The New York Times). <br><br>  So did the Bush administration.  Colin Powell joined in the "absolutely terrifying" hours, arriving at the office at 6 am and not leaving until 7 pm.  Condoleezza Rice got up every day at 4:30 in the morning to get to the gym before starting work. <br><br>  PS We recommend another useful article on the work on yourself - <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/vosem-poleznyx-utrennix-privychek-kotorye-povysyat-vashu-produktivnost/">EIGHT USEFUL MORNING HABITS THAT WILL ENHANCE YOUR PRODUCTIVITY</a> . <br><br>  PPS In accordance with the thoughts voiced in the comments to this article, we have published <a href="https://megamozg.ru/company/testutor/blog/25606/">material about the "owls"</a> . <br><br>  The author of the translation is Vyacheslav Davidenko, the founder of the <a href="http://testutor.ru/">TESTutor</a> company. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299376/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299376/</a></p>
