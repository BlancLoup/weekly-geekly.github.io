  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Administration without a tie.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In system administration, there are at least two opposing approaches, I call them ‚ÄúFrom shit and sticks‚Äù (di_halt), which is also the approach of ‚Äúleft-handed‚Äù and ‚Äúdude‚Äù.  Each of them, judging by the abundance of holivars on the Internet, has enough adherents.  Each administrator chooses one of the approaches based on internal beliefs and realities of being.  Most often he has to make various compromises with his conscience and with the budget for IT. <br><br>  Of course, there is also a third approach - ‚Äúrazdolbaysky‚Äù, but somehow I don‚Äôt really want to talk about him.  If the administrator wants to put things in order, he will.  If you do not want, then big money and modern equipment will not help.  There are a lot of examples in the current work of such an approach. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Each of the listed styles of administrator's percent behavior depends on him 70% on himself and only on the remaining 30% of the work environment.  Someone damn interesting to squeeze the incredible from the absolute rubbish, someone give a white floor and automated tape library.  The first one shakes the forums looking for the motherboard and power supply for its new super-server on Gentoo, the second will be picky about exploring the RHEL advanced technical support contract for the cluster on Sun Fire X. One will consider the other as a choreographer, while the second one will play as a child.  However, characteristically, both will be right. <br><br>  How to find out what type you belong to?  Simple enough.  I have to answer myself (honestly) the next few questions.

      1) The first and most important question.  In the supermarket, you, in your home, always transfer shopping in the basket in the most optimal way, you know from the power grid more wiring workers, you are ‚Äúrushing‚Äù from dozens and hundreds of live, working and performing computers computers in your hands, you have no holidays and it does not scare, they can call your phone at any time of the day or night?  Not?  Do not read further, you are not an admin at all.  Take care of management, become a user or, at worst, you can always start cleaning floors or windows.  The world is big. <br><br>  2) Are you interested in collecting a car that will work the fastest of all, and at the same time, money is zero-whole-FIG-tenths and 100 rubles from your pocket?  Search through all forums, find the most optimal hardware, compile software with tricky keys, optimize tcp / ip stack, so what‚Äôs there, rewrite!  Achieve the inclusion of their patches in the official SVN and for a long time, hands correct?  Good.  And again?  And 2 more times?  And 2 more times 2 times?  And 10 times 10?  If the answer is still yes, then you are a real "lefty."  GPL's grateful people will erect a monument during their lifetime.  With this approach, Google began, and quite well finished. <br><br>  3) You do not consider it shameful to forget the password to the server (after all, it is still written somewhere in the technical documentation volume) and even you allow yourself not to remember what rack it is in, the main goal is to touch the car as little as possible, make it do it yourself absolutely everything from software updates to the ban of guilty users;  You are dreaming about uptime in 10 years, but damn it, the last failure was only 3 years ago because of the bastards of electricians who turned off at the same time (who could imagine!) And the main feeder and the line going from the diesel engine in the yard?  Even if this diesel is located only in sweet dreams, you still managed to convince the authorities to buy Cisco routers and switches instead of D-Link for the whole company by some incredible miracle and at the cost of a pair of gray hair?  You are "dude."  You can easily manage both with a dozen and with hundreds of other machines, you have perfect order in the server room and after your death even a cleaning woman can change the backup tapes for a long time according to the left instructions.  Data center RAO UES for you, as well as the MSC RAS. <br><br>  <i>Any resemblance to real characters is completely random.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>When writing this opus, unfortunately, not a single hamster suffered.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Outside the window -10¬∫;</i>  <i>Bill Gates is still rich.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/52544/">https://habr.com/ru/post/52544/</a></p>
