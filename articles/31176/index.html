  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The most promising IT skills and professions</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> <i>Continuing the topic of <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/blog/translations/12719.html">endangered IT professions</a> , the journalist Mary Brandel based on the results of a conversation with recruitment agencies made another list - these are the most popular skills and IT specialties in the American labor market.</i> <br><br>  ‚ÄúWhat I see in Silicon Valley is completely contrary to the view that the American programmer‚Äôs profession is becoming extinct due to offshore programming,‚Äù said Kevin Scott, Google‚Äôs senior engineering manager, as well as the founder and participant of several professional and educational Computer Engineering Association (ACM) Commissions.  ‚ÄúFrom large corporations to start-ups, all companies recruit employees as aggressively as possible.‚Äù <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Many recruiters admit that there are more open positions on the market now than they can fill.  According to Kate Keizer, an associate professor at the IT department at Marquette University in Milwaukee, students sign up for a job before they graduate.  In January, Keizer interviewed 34 last-year students in the system analysis and design group where she teaches, and it turned out that 24 of them had already accepted job offers (as the preliminary work contract proposal in America is) from employers.  This is despite the fact that almost six months remained until the end of studies.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure that the remaining ten, who didn‚Äôt have contracts at the time, probably already got a job by today,‚Äù says Kate. <br><br>  The market for IT specialists is very ‚Äúhot‚Äù, but only for those with the right skills.  If you want to catch the wave, listen to what the eight most promising professions and skills of the future say, including recruiters, programming teachers, computer science professors and other experts.

      <b>1. Machine learning</b> <br>  As more and more companies are developing programs for social filtering, spam filtering and fraud recognition in large amounts of data, some experts see a rapid increase in demand for machine learning specialists who can develop algorithms and techniques to improve the efficiency of computers. <br><br>  Kevin Scott says: ‚ÄúThis is not only the case of Google.  There are many applications that work with large, large, large amounts of data, which creates a fundamental problem: how to organize this data and present it to users. ‚Äù <br><br>  The demand for such applications requires data mining skills, statistical modeling and data structuring, among others.  "You can't just take it off and fend off some of these problems," explains Scott, "because the data structures or algorithms you choose determine whether you get a sensible solution to the problem or not." <br><br>  You can learn machine learning either from work experience or through specialized higher education.  It doesn't matter where you have mastered the profession - companies snapping up such specialists as quickly as they can. <br><br>  <b>2. Application mobilization</b> <br>  The race to ensure mobile access to content is reminiscent of the wild time of the Internet boom of the 90s.  As devices like BlackBerry and Treo are increasingly used as business tools, companies will need specialists to port existing business applications, such as ERP, procurement systems, and cost management systems, to the PDA. <br><br>  <b>3. Wireless networks</b> <br>  Standards WiFi, WiMax and Bluetooth are gaining real popularity, so many companies are looking for intelligent security professionals.  Since a whole bunch of wireless technologies are currently being used, you need to fit them together and make sure that this hybrid solution is secure, because the risks are much higher here than in the case of wired networks. <br><br>  However, no one will hire an employee exclusively as a ‚Äúwireless technician‚Äù.  Companies need network administrators of the appropriate specialization. <br><br>  <b>4. Man-machine interfaces</b> <br>  Another area that will experience a boost in the near future is the design of interfaces and human-computer interaction systems for the web and desktop PCs.  Over time, the industry realized that using crappy interfaces is not normal, and thanks to companies like Apple, users are becoming more accustomed to well-thought-out, high-quality interfaces, so they demand the same quality from other software products. <br><br>  <b>5. Project Management</b> <br>  Project managers have always been in great demand, but with an increase in budget requirements and project success, managers are very necessary to know what they are doing.  The descriptions of vacancies begin to meet the phrase ‚Äúa <i>real</i> project manager is required,‚Äù and not just a person with such nominal status. <br><br>  This is a big difference even in comparison with last year, when anyone could easily take the position of a project manager.  Now the process of interviewing such candidates has become much stricter. <br><br>  When interviewing, some recruiters carefully check candidates, studying their experience in solving various situations, including the distribution of responsibilities of conflicting units or problem solving.  It is the real experience of conflict management that interests us, not the theory of conflict resolution derived from textbooks. <br><br>  <b>6. General network administration skills</b> <br>  No matter what position you are in the field of IT, you will no longer avoid working with networks, which is why this skill has become crucial for non-network professionals, including programmers.  They must understand the basics of network technologies, at least the necessary minimum, that is, TCP / IP, Ethernet and fiber, as well as have experience in distributed and network computing. <br><br>  There is an acute shortage of specialists capable of writing applications for data centers.  They need to know how to effectively parallelize processes and create software design adapted to the network structure.  People who understand the basic principles of distributed systems are very much appreciated. <br><br>  <b>7. Network Convergence Techniques</b> <br>  As many companies deploy VoIP systems, there is a growing need for network administrators who understand all types of networks: LAN, WAN, voice, and the Internet ‚Äî and how they can be combined together. <br><br>  In the case when you need to solve a specific problem, companies do not want to hear from the network administrator the phrase ‚Äúoh, this is the problem of telephone lines‚Äù, and from the telephone technician ‚Äúcall the network administrator‚Äù.  There is a huge demand for specialists from the world of telecoms, who also understand what a computer network is, or for those who administered computer networks, but at the same time understand voice networks and know how to implement convergence. <br><br>  <b>8. Programming open source</b> <br>  Employers are increasingly willing to hire a free software developer.  Although some may think that the time of open source programmers has already passed, but in reality it is returning even on a large scale in various programming areas: at the operating system level, and in application development.  Employees with experience with Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP, collectively called LAMP, are in high demand. <br><br>  According to some experts, the cause of this phenomenon is the dissatisfaction of users with the level of proprietary software and security problems with it, especially at the level of OS and DBMS. <br><br>  <b>9. Business Intelligence Systems</b> <br>  Business intelligence systems (business intelligence) are also experiencing some momentum in their development, which is why there is a demand for professionals who know how to work with technologies such as Cognos, Business Objects and Hyperion. <br><br>  Companies make substantial investments in business analytics, but they do not need the usual techniques that write scripts and queries.  To become an advanced data mining expert, you need a thorough functional knowledge of the business that you will be analyzing.  People who are specialists in both industries (both business and technology) are by far the most sought-after specialists in the United States. <br><br>  <b>10. Embedded Security Systems</b> <br>  Security professionals have been in demand for the past few years, but today relevant skills and certificates are required in many professions, not only in security.  In almost every job that has been encountered lately, the word ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù is found.  Employers need to create a secure environment in any case - whether a person administers a mail server or develops a new software application.  This becomes part of the standard employee requirements. <br><br>  The trend is the end-to-end integration of security systems into the company's daily operations.  Of course, security specialists are still needed, but now their role is gradually being distributed among all employees of the company. <br><br>  <b>11. Integrating Digital Home Technologies</b> <br>  The house of the average American is increasingly turning into a digital paradise, in the adjacent markets of digital audio and video equipment is a real boom, as well as in the markets of home security systems and automated lighting systems.  But who installs all these systems and repairs them in the event of a breakdown? <br><br>  To answer this question, the CompTIA American Computer Association initiated certification of specialists in a new specialty: Digital Home Technology Integrator.  This is one of the fastest growing markets in recent years. <br><br>  <b>12. .Net, C #, C ++ in Java environment</b> <br>  Recruiters and course instructors talk about the arrival of a mass of orders for programmers in a wide range of programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãand environments, including ASP.Net, VB.net, XML, PHP, Java, C # and C ++, but employers need more than just a coder who works independently.  They need someone who knows Java, but who is able to work as a lead programmer or project coordinator. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/31176/">https://habr.com/ru/post/31176/</a></p>
