  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Dumb ways to die, or why data centers ‚Äúfall‚Äù</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/130/ce3/4af/130ce34af9e84a2c960ea6032e6dda9f.png"><br><br>  The operation of the data center, the server is a bit like driving on a highway.  When the road is empty, you can take a risk and ride against the rules, and nothing terrible will happen.  But as soon as there are a lot of cars on the road, any wrong maneuver, an overlooked pit or pothole can lead to an accident.  A similar situation with data centers and server: the greater the workload, the higher the cost of the error. </p><br><p>  Today I‚Äôll tell you about errors in design, construction and operation, which may cause an accident in the data center. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Errors at the design and construction stage </h2><br><p>  I had a separate <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/dataline/blog/311826/">article</a> on errors in design.  There are mainly listed points that will make the operation of the data center inconvenient, but now I‚Äôll tell you about what will really hurt. </p><br><p>  <b>The project does not provide for the whole system.</b>  Some believe that the data center can do without a system of guaranteed power.  i.e. DSU.  Once, one of the customers for whom I did an audit of the data center project asked what the level of fault tolerance would be for <a href="http://www.gpxglobal.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/TIERSTANDARD_Topology_120801.pdf">Uptime</a> without DGU.  I have not found anything better than to call Tier 0. </p><br><p>  Many perceive DGU as a reserve, which can be neglected, if necessary, - spare the same.  In fact, it is treated as the main one, because only this type of energy supply can we fully control. </p><br><p>  <b>Single point of failure.</b>  Here are possible options: </p><br><ul><li>  there is no reservation at all.  Then a breakdown or scheduled maintenance will mean a complete loss of an element of the system. </li><li>  selective reservation.  This option can be very tentatively called reliable, since the level of redundancy of the system will still be considered for the minimum reserved element.  For example, you have duplicated power supply beams, diesel generator sets, switchboards, PDUs in the rack, and UPSs are not.  If this UPS fails, then everything that was in the chain after it will not save. </li></ul><br><p>  <b>Error in the calculations.</b>  Here are the top most sensitive mistakes in the power distribution system: </p><br><ul><li>  wrong selectivity.  Selectivity protects against overloads and short circuits.  To maintain selectivity, the nominal value of automata from the power source to the consumer must be reduced.  If the compressor is closed in the air conditioner, the machine will turn off inside the air conditioner, and not the one in the switchboard. <br>  If selectivity is not observed, then the machine will not perform its protective functions, and the fault will go higher in the chain.  So due to overload or short circuit with improper selectivity in the engine room, you can lose a whole power beam. </li><li>  mismatch of cable section and power of the machine.  If the nominal of the machine does not correspond to the cable section, then when the load is exceeded, the machine will not knock out, but the cable will overheat or - worse - melt.  Choose automatons and cables according to the table for calculating cable cross-section, current and power. </li><li>  no power reserve.  Vnatyag design is a bad practice.  The equipment began to consume more than you expected on the project, you needed to connect additional equipment, the losses on the power line due to the length of the tracks - all this can be overcome if you add 30% of the reserve to the design capacity. </li><li>  starting currents are not taken into account.  Equipment that has electric motors, pumps or compressors on board, during start-up, places a greater load on the network than during operation.  If you do not provide for this in the project, then you will not be able to simultaneously run several air conditioners or chillers.  The system will not cope with the load, and the machines will shut down. </li><li>  The battery charge currents are not taken into account.  The UPS gives about 10% of its capacity to charge the battery.  If you do not take into account this additional load, the UPS will not be able to switch from battery power to the ‚Äúcity‚Äù: every time the UPS returns to the city power supply and starts charging the battery, the machines will knock out the machines. </li><li>  improper cabling in the sleeves between rooms.  Not exactly about the calculations, but also to the construction.  There are two points: <br>  1. All phases (l1, l2, l3) must be laid in the same sleeve with a neutral, otherwise the cables begin to overheat. <br>  2. When several single-core cables are used (several cables are used for one phase), make sure that the cables on the trays lie in the correct sequence (see the relevant section in the Rules for Electrical Installations).  No need to twist them, braid in braids for beauty, if you do not want it all overheated. </li></ul><br><p>  Now for cold supply: </p><br><ul><li>  incorrect assessment of outdoor temperature conditions.  When designing, they often take as a basis statistics on the average temperature in a particular city - without taking into account the specific features of a particular building and from unverified sources.  If the roof of the building is very hot in the sun, then the real temperature will be several degrees higher. </li><li>  poor air circulation between outdoor units.  Due to the tight location and problems with the free passage of air, the external blocks of air conditioners begin to suck in each other's spent hot air.  It may not be so hot outside, but the temperature at the entrance to the outdoor unit will be high.  The same result will be obtained if external units are placed near the exhaust pipe of a diesel generator set or above the diesel generator set, next to transformers.  Consider if there are additional heat sources near the outdoor units. </li><li>  incorrectly calculated real power conditioners and cooling capacity.  The power consumption of air conditioners on the passport is not always true.  The manufacturer shows beautiful numbers?  Do not be lazy to read the documents yourself and find out under what conditions such indicators will be.  And what will be the consumption at maximum load?  If air conditioners start consuming more than the project's peak load, then there is a risk of being left without air conditioning.  Leave a reserve. </li><li>  Similarly, with cooling capacity: depending on the length of the tracks, outdoor temperature and operating parameters, it can vary. </li></ul><br><h2>  Errors in operation </h2><br><p>  A data center built on an exemplary project can be spoiled by improper operation.  Below we consider what mistakes in the management of engineering infrastructure can lead to accidents. </p><br><p>  <b>Unbalanced phase and ray load.</b>  The power of cable and automatons is used effectively if the load on the phases is evenly distributed.  When one or two phases are overloaded, and one or two are underloaded, the so-called ‚Äúimbalance‚Äù of phases occurs.  Because of it, the available power is used inefficiently.  In the worst case, this will lead to the disconnection of the machine and overheating of the cable. </p><br><p>  With rays, the story is as follows: in a data center with a power reserve of 2N, when one of the power supply is disconnected, the second takes on the load that has failed.  In order for the remaining beam to withstand a double load, each of them must be loaded only half the rated power, taking into account the starting currents.  Otherwise, the reserve on the second beam will not save. </p><br><p>  Both conditions must be respected at the same time.  Monitoring the load distribution from transformers to PDU will help monitor the system in the maximum number of points.  How to arrange it, told in this <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/dataline/blog/324610/">article</a> . </p><br><p>  <b>The settings on the machines.</b>  To maintain selectivity, the nominal power of the automata is artificially reduced with the help of settings.  During operation, when it is necessary to connect an additional load, the settings are forgotten and are guided by the nominal value of the machine.  Accordingly, if the connected load is greater than the setpoint, the machine will shut down. </p><br><p>  <b>Instructions and regulations service operation.</b>  In the server or data center, a pre-emergency condition, and the engineer has little understanding of what to do and who to call.  Even worse, when the person on duty decides to do nothing.  Regulations and instructions can save you from confusion and loss of time during an emergency. </p><br><p>  But the rules of procedure are different: if it is written for a tick, it has never been updated and no one has tested it during the exercises, then we can assume that there are no rules. </p><br><p>  Even if all the schemes have been worked out, the regulations and instructions should always be at hand (in paper and electronic form) so that in case of an accident you do not have to waste time searching for them.  Hang posters with brief instructions on the workplace of the engineer, from which the operation to rescue the data center in case of an accident begins.  Instructions for working with the equipment, place it directly on the equipment case.  You can add checklists to the instructions, in which the engineer will mark each of his actions.  So it will be less likely to skip items instructions. </p><br><p>  Quickly locate the problem in the data center will help the location of the equipment, which must also be relevant in the reach of engineers. </p><br><p>  <b>Marking</b>  It would seem, what does marking have to do with accidents?  The most direct.  For example, turn on the machine turned off - the question a couple of minutes.  But if there are no schemes and markings, then this turns into a real quest with good prospects for a long simple.  Or another situation: for repair, you need to turn off some equipment.  Open the shield, and there all the machines are the same from the face and without labeling.  How high is the probability to turn off not what you need, consider yourself. </p><br><p>  <b>Monitoring</b>  In small server-based monitoring, the engineering infrastructure may be absent as a class or not all systems are being monitored.  Then we have to deal with the following situations: on Sunday evening the air conditioner turns off, but the engineer only finds out about it on Monday morning, when there is a bath in the server room.  Or there was a breakdown with city food, and the diesel engine did not start.  The situation was noticed only when we sent alerts about problems with one of the server power beams.  In either case, a large-scale accident could have been prevented if minimal monitoring had been set up with SMS or email alerts. </p><br><p>  The monitoring of data centers has its own nuances: it needs to be properly configured.  For example, set valid thresholds.  If the monitor is permanently red from critical errors, then monitoring is configured incorrectly.  For an engineer, such monitoring will quickly become uninformative, false alarms will occur, and real accidents will go unnoticed among routine alerts. </p><br><h2>  What else could cause an accident? </h2><br><p>  Let's see what can go wrong in the work of air conditioning, power supply (power distribution system, uninterruptible power system, diesel generator set) and fire extinguishing system. </p><br><p>  <b>Cooling.</b>  For the cold supply system, everything can start with the breakdown of several air conditioners, for example, due to the fact that the outdoor units are clogged with poplar fluff.  If the hall is well loaded and the cold ceases to be enough, then local overheating occurs.  Freon air conditioners are very sensitive to inlet temperature, so when it rises, other air conditioners start to stop by mistake.  As a result of this ‚Äúdomino effect,‚Äù the hall will remain without cooling. </p><br><p>  For chiller systems, the worst is the loss of pressure in the circuit, for example, due to leaks.  In this case, the whole system rises, not a separate air conditioner.  In order to track this situation in time, monitor the pressure, install more leakage sensors, consider the possibility of feeding the system with the help of storage tanks, additional pumps. </p><br><p>  <b>Uninterrupted power supply.</b>  In addition to the failure of the UPS, which can be prevented by maintenance and timely repair, there is such an interesting thing as the mismatch of the real time of battery life of the UPS and the assessment on the UPS display.  I, of course, the case when the display shows more than it actually is.  For example, during maintenance of the boards between the DGU and the UPS, when the battery holds the entire load, the operation service counts for one time, but in reality it gets a couple of minutes less. </p><br><p>  It is possible to avoid such embarrassment by periodically conducting a ‚Äúcontrolled‚Äù discharge of the battery with the construction of the corresponding graphs.  Based on this graph, the battery life is calculated and the readings on the UPS screen are calibrated.  For reinsurance, the resulting time is better to round down.  It‚Äôs like a clock: it‚Äôs better to be in a hurry and you will come to the meeting sooner than you‚Äôll be late. </p><br><p>  <b>Guaranteed power supply.</b>  Failures can occur at any stage of the DSU: </p><br><ul><li>  when the main power was turned off, the signal to start the diesel generator set did not go; </li><li>  DGU did not start; </li><li>  wound up, but did not take the load; </li><li>  DGU worked and disconnected; </li><li>  falsely triggered fire extinguishing system for the container sensor; </li><li>  fuel run out or was substandard. </li><li> To DGU worked without surprises, regularly conduct <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/dataline/blog/319926/">test launches under load</a> . </li></ul><br><p>  <b>Firefighting:</b> </p><br><ul><li>  False alarm system.  You can protect against this by moving the system to semi-automatic mode.  That is, before releasing the gas, a specially trained person checks if there really is a problem where the sensor has tripped.  And then you never know: someone unsuccessfully touched the sensor under the raised floor, and the alarm went off. </li><li>  the system did not work when needed.  Treated by tests. </li><li>  errors in directions: the sensor worked in one place, and the gas went in another room.  The output is the same - testing. </li></ul><br><p>  I‚Äôll stop on this, although, of course, these are not all the reasons for which the data center can ‚Äúlie down‚Äù.  Share your stories in the comments.  If an accident has occurred, and the reason has not been able to figure out, write here or at <a href="">b&gt; consulting@dtln.ru &lt;/ b</a> .
