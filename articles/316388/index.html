  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Never take a counter offer</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I guess we all went through a job change at least once.  There may be various reasons to change jobs: new opportunities, higher wages, problems with colleagues, etc. <br>  I call them the <b>‚Äútrigger‚Äù of the transition</b> .  When it works, it is difficult to stop, and then there are two possible scenarios: <br><br><ul><li>  <i>You start looking for a new job.</i> </li><li>  <i>New job starts looking for you</i> </li></ul><br>  Sooner or later the moment comes when you get a proposal so attractive that you have to be crazy (or <strike>stupid</strike> ) to refuse it.  Accepting the offer, you suddenly remember such a thing, which is called "interview at the dismissal."  You remember your good relationship with your current employer and start writing a letter of resignation late in the evening. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Sometimes, if you are a valuable shot for a company where you work, you can be countered.  This can happen right at the interview.  Of course, you will be given time to think, and you will respond with gratitude and a promise to respond as soon as possible. <br><br>  <b>In general, you should always be prepared for this situation.</b>  I think counterproposing is a rather <b>dangerous</b> thing.  Saying that you should be ready for it, I meant that you <b>should never take it</b> . <br><blockquote>  <i>‚ÄúYou will earn twice as much, get a promotion, a ticket for public transport, FREE POWER!‚Äù</i> </blockquote><br>  Consider an example.  Let some <i>problem A</i> serve as a trigger for your desire to change jobs.  Since you are a good employee, you have already tried to solve this problem (for example, you asked for salary increases or tried to change the process), but you did not succeed.  Now, suddenly, <i>problem A</i> is solved in some 10 minutes.  Why it could not be solved before?  How much time will pass before any <i>problem B</i> appears?  When <i>Problem B</i> arises, it will be more difficult.  The overall situation will not change.

      What about the script when there are no reasons and / or problems at all?  When all you feel is a strong desire for change.  We are all human and not all of our actions are rational, so even a feeling that we cannot explain to ourselves can give rise to such a desire.  The reality is much harsher in such cases.  People do not expect from someone whose merits it is difficult for them to appreciate that he will come one day and say: <i>"Guys, I leave you because I have a strange feeling</i> . <i>"</i>  When all that is is only a feeling, then the situation is unlikely to change even with a great counter-offer, because the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcontinuing to stay at the same job due to the appearance of a free ticket for public transport will not cause you any positive emotions.  This feeling will be with you all the time, it will complicate your relationship with your employer, and there will be no winning side. <br><br>  I saw <a href="http://thevetrecruiter.com/news/a-perfect-case-study-for-not-accepting-a-counter-offer/">polls</a> showing that the majority of employees who accepted a counter offer, nevertheless, leave the company then, on average, after 15 months.  There are always exceptions;  moreover, there are cases when making a counter offer is the right decision (your cat dies and you need a lot of money to save it). <br><br>  But if your situation is not exceptional, then here is the answer to the counteroffer that you have to give: <b>‚ÄúNo, thank you.‚Äù</b> <br><br><h4>  UPDATE </h4><br>  After the publication of the original post, a lot of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item%3Fid%3D12624112">comments</a> appeared, because of which the author decided to clarify his position. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>I am not a recruiter.</b>  I have no relation to recruitment agencies, nor to independent recruiters.  What you read is my personal opinion. </li><li>  <b>My opinion is not based on the sources mentioned</b> ;  I referred to them as additional support for my position.  To get more information about these polls "from the inside", you can see the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item%3Fid%3D12624364">discussion</a> . </li><li>  Many commentators have written that if you are satisfied with your current job and the counter offer contains a pay rise, you should accept it and stay at that job, but with a higher salary.  I think that if you are, in general, satisfied with your current work and the salary has become the only embarrassing circumstance, then you should not immediately start looking for a new job.  <b>You should talk to the manager and ask for a raise.</b>  But if you did so and the situation did not change, and something moved only when you threatened to leave, then I think when you have other problems, they will not be understood until you go through the entire recruitment process in another companies and do not prepare to leave. </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/316388/">https://habr.com/ru/post/316388/</a></p>
