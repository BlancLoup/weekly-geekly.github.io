In the latest press release, Google announced its latest project, the Android Wear operating system. <br><br>  Android Wear is not just another version of smart watches.  This OS is designed to be the driving force of a number of devices (devices) worn on or with themselves. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a86/cf3/bab/a86cf3bab9622b9718938590f3268850.jpg">

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Competitive smart watches, such as Samsung's Galaxy Gear and Apple's soon released iWatch, will provide the public with a wider choice of wearable devices than Android Wear, however, here are five reasons why Android Wear will be the market leader, see video: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/0xQ3y902DEQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhibCfUikCe_6rx-7Wf1AHHMTD-WwA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Reason # 1: Early entry into the market.</b> <br><br>  Google goes to the market of wearable devices before anyone else.  By the time the first competitive products appear, Google devices will have filled the market.  Depending on the number of features offered by Android Wear, Apple and other companies may have to make the latest technical modifications before launch, giving their products a more attractive look to the consumer. <br><br>  When 1World‚Äôs audience was asked if they wanted to add a ‚Äúsmart watch‚Äù to their phones, 71% expressed interest.  At the same time, the fact that only 3% of respondents already have a ‚Äúsmart watch‚Äù indicates that Google‚Äôs early entry into the wearable device market has great potential ( <a href="https://1worldonline.com/">link to the survey</a> ). <br><br>  <b>Reason # 2: Consumer Electronics</b> <br><br>  The first Android Wear devices will be available this year, and Motorola, Samsung, HTC, Intel, LG and many others have already offered their services for the development of consumer electronics.  Since Android Wear is an OS, individual manufacturers will be able to develop designs for smart watches without worrying about their own operating systems.  This means that manufacturers will be able to pay more attention to the aesthetics of devices, rather than software. <br><br>  Since 54% of people polled by 1 World prefer the appearance rather than the functionality of wearable devices ( <a href="https://1worldonline.com/">link to the survey</a> ), developers who want to use the Android Wear OS will have clear advantages.  1World's CMO, Brad Keyton, after visiting the CES-2014 (Consumer Electronics Show) exhibition, says that ‚Äúthe most important thing that will attract consumers and enthusiasts of these new technologies is the‚Äú form ‚Äùor appearance.  Perhaps the first enthusiasts will be wearing on their hands, almost mini-computers, the rest 95% of consumers will not do this. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Reason number 3: Connecting to other devices of the Internet of Things (Internet of Things)</b> <br><br>  One of the advantages of Android Wear is that it combines the control of all home devices, and not only connects to a smartphone.  The recent acquisition of Google by Nest will enable the new product, Android Wear, to become a powerful tool for managing many other home appliances on the Internet.  How about smart garage doors, a thermostat, or windows?  You can control your home simply by using your voice. <br>  Despite the fact that smart homes have not yet become mainstream, 39% of respondents want to control appliances using their smartphones ( <a href="https://1worldonline.com/">link to the survey</a> ) <br><br>  <b>Reason # 4: Voice control</b> <br><br>  Google made the right decision by adding a voice feature to your device.  It is known that Google is recognized as one of the best on the market for voice recognition, and SmartWatch have a limited area for displaying information: their touch screens and keyboards are particularly difficult to interact due to the size of the screen.  And here a technological voice recognition solution came in handy. <br><br>  <b>Reason # 5: Wearable device: all-in-one</b> <br><br>  Android Wear has placed several functions in one device: it can be text messages, receiving calls, training data, and much more.  Jawbone Up and Nike's Fuelband + may be the best devices for tracking fitness workouts, but that‚Äôs all they can do.  As long as wearable techs grow, we will continue to expect more from each device, and if the devices do not have a very specific application (for example: for medical control), consumers will not want to control multiple devices and will prefer to multiple - one universal. <br><br>  What do you think about Android Wear OS from Google? <br> <a href="https://1worldonline.com/external/test/widget.html"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/105/42a/90b/10542a90b2338c539fdb7105ff01470a.png"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/217553/">https://habr.com/ru/post/217553/</a></p>
