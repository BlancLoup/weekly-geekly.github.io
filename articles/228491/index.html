This is a unified adaptive approach to interfaces across the entire range of devices and devices - web, mobile, tablets, wearable devices, TV, cars.  By ‚Äúmaterial‚Äù design, they understand in part a reference to skeomorphism - they are not afraid to use shadows, emphasize the materiality of objects, and enhance the role of animation.  Its <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/6/27/5849272/material-world-how-google-discovered-what-software-is-made-of">essence is well revealed by Mathias Duarte</a> , now the vice-president of the design company, who previously made a breakthrough webOS. <br><br>  It can be said that visually it is the development of the current Android style with an emphasis on the color cap (along with the status bar tint) and the round default icon of the main action.  The latter is very cool played on different screens, for example, <a href="">being at the junction of the caps and content horizontally and continuing the line of icons vertically</a> .  The active use of cards as the basis of ideology continues, it becomes more tiles a la metro.  Sidebar remained in place, despite the fact that the recent update of Google+ pointedly refused it.  Well, the corporate font Roboto has been updated, which apparently should be the basis for web services ( <a href="http://www.polymer-project.org/apps/topeka/">the Quiz App concept</a> shows how it can be). <br><br>  There are many parallels with iOS8: the notification mechanism with quick actions that are immediately visible on the screen when it appears;  a bunch of smartphone and Chromebook;  Google Fit wearable device data collection hub.  The stacks of the windows are used more actively, the dialogs are changing in the spirit of Google Now cards, and the selection / copy / paste mode has finally become clear.  It's funny that navigation / back / home / running navigation icons that are common to the entire interface become similar to the four PlayStation branded symbols.  A large <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/6/25/5842098/google-material-design-photos">collection of screens</a> . <br><br>  <a href="http://www.android.com/tv/">The updated Android TV</a> also uses a unified design.  He is visible in the car platform, clearly visible in the clock (by the way, the round button of the main action as one of the main elements of visual identification <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/3032407/google-creates-a-real-life-easy-button-that-can-do-anything-with-a-tap">seems to come from there</a> ).  Based on the ideology of Material Design, a new version of the key OS - <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/6/25/5842218/google-android-l-photos">Android L</a> will be released.  Moreover, thanks to the initiative of <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/6/25/5841976/android-one-hardware-reference-program">Android One with the reference device</a> , the number of phones with default interface will increase.  And the design of TV, cars and watches by third-party manufacturers will not be able to change at all.  So after the seizure of the Google market, he was engaged in solving design problems.  And he showed one of the strongest concepts, working on such a huge scale.

From the interface point of view, this is an evolution of last year‚Äôs radical redesign with the addition of some new patterns - circular menus a la Path, working with widgets in the notification center, open popups leaving the previous window in the background, enhanced interaction between applications through the menu of sharing, icons in the dialog menus, limited use of cards (Health), development of icon style, double-sided svayp along the Mailbox line a-la and other small details.  It is also interesting how this style has fallen on the new MacOS - an excellent example of a single visual language throughout the ecosystem (with normal settings and Safari icons! And <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/3031354/apple-changes-os-xs-main-font-for-the-first-time-ever">yet, Lucida Grande</a> ). <br><br>  One of the most spectacular is the possibility of cross-channel interaction between devices, wired at the OS level.  Scenarios of transition between devices will become even smoother (if, of course, all this works as in a demonstration).  Well, now iOS is a hub for interacting with auto, smart home, wearable devices (if all this, of course, will be supported by manufacturers).  <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/6/2/5765048/apple-wwdc-2014-os-x-yosemite-ios-8-and-all-the-news-you-need-to-know">List of all announced</a> . <br><br>  But the coolest is the new <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/">Swift programming language</a> , the next step to visual programming.  IOS guidelines are so minimalistic that a developer doesn't need a designer.  And the development environment is simple enough so that the designer himself can create final solutions.  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/swift-programming-language/id881256329%3Fmt%3D11">Guide to it</a> .  As it turned out, Bret Victor, one of the main evangelists of visual programming, had a hand in it (UPD: as it turned out later, <a href="http://www.quora.com/Did-Bret-Victor-work-with-Apple-on-the-design-of-Swift-Playground">not a fact</a> or a <a href="http://worrydream.com/Apple/">fact</a> ).
