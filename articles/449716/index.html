  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Acronis opens API for developers for the first time.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Beginning April 25, 2019, partners have the opportunity to get Early Access to the <b>Acronis Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãPlatform platform.</b>  This is the first stage of the program to form a new ecosystem of solutions, within which companies around the world will be able to use the Acronis platform to integrate cyber defense services into their products and solutions, and also have the opportunity to offer their own services to the world community through our future marketplace.  How it works?  Read in our post. <br><br> <a href="https://www.acronis.com/en-us/partners/cyber-platform/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fj/tg/vq/fjtgvqf6vud8ttsode-dgtsryns.png"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Acronis has been developing data protection products for 16 years.  Now Acronis from a product-oriented company is turning into a platform company.  What does this mean in practice?  Acronis Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãPlatform platform becomes the basis for the provision of any of our services. <br><br>  All Acronis products - from backup services to protection systems - work today on the basis of a single Acronis Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãPlatform platform.  And this means that in the conditions of the continuing growth of data volumes, the shift of computation towards Edge and the development of smart devices (IoT), important information can be protected directly on the device itself or within the application.  To do this, it will be enough to use ready-made tools that Acronis will offer developers in the fall of 2019.  In the meantime, you can get early access to the platform for a more "intimate familiarity" with its architecture, <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6i/j7/la/6ij7lad2ha-gketwspsc4tvwlge.png"><br>  The platform approach continues to gain momentum all over the world, and the platforms created earlier allow today to get additional opportunities (and profits) both to their creators and partners.  So, one of the most popular platforms is SalesForce.com.  Established in 2005, today it offers one of the largest AppExchange marketplace, with over 3,000 applications registered for the beginning of 2019.  But most importantly, more than 50% of the profits of the company and its partners are due to the work of the marketplace and joint solutions based on open APIs.

    <h2>  How deep should the integration be? </h2><br>  We believe that integration can at different levels bring different results, but even a small movement towards the interaction between products allows you to create new solutions and simplifies the life of end users.  We at Acronis use five levels of integration of our own product lines.  For example, at the level of marketing and sales it is possible to create sets of products and offer them to customers on more favorable terms. <br><br>  The following is the level of integration of user interfaces, when a client is able to manage several products through the same window, without setting up uniform parameters. <br><br>  After that we proceed to the unification of management.  Ideally, you need to create a single management console for all products.  By the way, this is what we plan to do for the entire set of Acronis solutions within the Acronis Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãPlatform. <br><br>  The fourth level is the integration of products, when individual solutions are given the opportunity to exchange information among themselves.  For example, it‚Äôs good when the backup system can ‚Äúcommunicate‚Äù with Ransomware protection tools and prevent attackers from encrypting backups. <br><br>  The deepest level is technological integration, when different solutions work on the same platform and can offer the user the most complete service.  Turning to the same libraries, we have the opportunity to create an ecosystem of solutions that will complement each other and will be fully compatible for solving end-user tasks. <br><br><h2>  Acronis Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãPlatform becomes open </h2><br>  Announcing Early Access to the Acronis Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãPlatform platform, we give partners the opportunity to get acquainted with our services, so that after the official presentation of the platform they will be easier to integrate with their own developments.  By the way, in this direction we have long been working with major partners, such as Microsoft, Google or ConnectWise. <br><br>  Already today, you can apply and get early access to the Acronis Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãPlatform to evaluate the possibility of sharing your Acronis services and developments <a href="https://www.acronis.com/en-us/partners/cyber-platform/">right here.</a> <br><br>  To interact with the platform, a whole set of new open <acronym>API</acronym> libraries and SDK development kits were developed to help build Acronis solutions into ready-made products of other companies, as well as to offer their own developments to the entire Acronis user community (and this is nothing less than 5,000,000 clients , more than 500,000 <nobr>business customers</nobr> and over 50,000 partners). <br><br><ul><li>  <b>The Management <acronym>API</acronym></b> is the main library that allows you to automate the services, as well as establish billing for using Acronis services in partner solutions. </li><li>  <b>Services <acronym>API</acronym></b> - allows you to use or integrate Acronis Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãPlatform services into third-party applications. </li><li>  <b>Data Sources SDK</b> - helps developers protect more data sources.  The toolkit will feature tools for working with cloud storage, SaaS applications, IoT devices, and so on. </li><li>  <b>Data Destination SDK</b> is a special set of tools that will allow independent developers to expand the range of data storage options for applications on our platform.  You can, for example, write data to Acronis Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãCloud, private clouds, public clouds, local or <nobr>software-defined</nobr> storage, as well as on special arrays and devices. </li><li>  <b>Data Management SDK</b> was designed to work with data and their analysis within the framework of the platform.  The tools contained in the toolkit will allow you to transform data, search and compress, scan archives and perform many other actions. </li><li>  <b>Integration SDK</b> is a set of tools that will help integrate third-party development into Acronis Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãCloud. </li></ul><br><h2>  Who benefits? </h2><br>  In addition to the fact that having an open platform for (obviously) beneficial Acronis company itself, open interfaces and ready-made SDKs will help partners earn additional profits and increase the value of their products by integrating Acronis services. <br><br>  One of the illustrative examples of partnership with Acronis is ConnectWise, which gained access to advanced integration capabilities.  As a result, ConnectWise partners work with Acronis products every quarter brings more than $ 200,000 through access to more than 26,000 partners to backup and other Acronis services. <br><br>  New APIs and SDKs, which are currently in the final formation stage, will allow integrating with the platform at the technological level, ensuring the provision of services on demand.  These initiatives are aimed at ISVs, service providers and integrator partners who are interested in offering their customers the highest level of service at the lowest possible cost. <br><br>  For example, features such as scanning for malware or vulnerabilities in a backup copy, checking the integrity of copied data, automatically creating a restore point before installing patches, and automatic protection based on threat intelligence technologies can be provided directly inside the software product.  That is, by purchasing a CRM service or a ready <nobr>-</nobr> made <nobr>ERP system</nobr> , the user can apply already built-in protection tools based on Acronis technologies - simply, conveniently and without leaving the application. <br><br>  Another level of integration is provided for popular services that could be useful to the entire ecosystem of Acronis users.  For example, Acronis portfolio does not have its own VPN, and therefore it can be assumed that such services will appear in the marketplace after the official launch of the platform.  In general, any development that will be in demand by a wide audience can be integrated with the Acronis Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãPlatform and will be provided to end users and partners in the form of ready-made services. <br><br><h2>  We are waiting for autumn </h2><br>  The official presentation of the Acronis Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãPlatform will be held at the Acronis <a href="https://acronis.events/summit2019/">Global <nobr>Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãSummit</nobr> from October 13 to 16, 2019 in Miami,</a> Florida, as well as at regional summits in Singapore and <nobr>Abu Dhabi</nobr> in September and December.  Training and certification to work with the new platform will be held at such events.  However, developers interested in using Acronis services can start working with the platform today by requesting test access and support here <a href="https://www.acronis.com/en-us/partners/cyber-platform/">https://www.acronis.com/en-us/partners/cyber-platform/</a> <br><br>  In the meantime, we will prepare a detailed story about the new API and SDK, as well as about the methods and principles of working with them. <br><br><h2>  Poll: </h2></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/449716/">https://habr.com/ru/post/449716/</a></p>
