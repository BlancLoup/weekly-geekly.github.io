  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Crimson Marketing</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Marketing played a cruel joke with Raspberry Pi. <br>  I will set out my view on this board, because I have repeatedly come across the fact that people do not understand its purpose, try to misuse it and switch to other ARM boards in disappointment. <br>  Meanwhile, the Raspberry Pi is a very important step that no one has managed to do before. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d52/10c/e97/d5210ce97180ba96c79994564b6f25cc.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A couple of prehistory proposals.  Since I learned how to program, I have always dreamed of being able to control objects in the real world.  The problem was that the computer was large, the periphery of his cat wept and the whole was designed to enter information into it and output it in the form of sounds, pictures, texts on the screen and paper. <br>  But I wanted to finally realize the dream and build a robot that can interact with the real world. <br><br><h4>  Divided Worlds </h4><br>  What did we have?  Microcontrollers are great, working with real objects is quite simple - there are legs, I recorded them in a variable number and they had voltage, I set up peripherals and you can control motors, servo drives, measure voltage, communicate with sensors and do a lot of interesting things. <br>  The trouble is that the memory and computing power of the MK is small.  So small that the vast majority of robots crawl along a white or black line into a blank, trying to stumble on the wall and that's it.  Not just a robot combines at least a few of these possibilities, and if it can, it costs so much money that only a very enthusiastic person who does not regret spending the cost of a good car for such experiments can repeat this at home.  But this is very exciting!  I want to make a really interesting robot that can do a lot both autonomously and on the instructions from a large PC, can interact with other robots and store some data.  But at MK, these capabilities are strongly limited by the available memory and computing power.  Yes, and WiFi to communicate over the network to fasten to the MC is often quite difficult.  At least on accessible and simple MK is a non-trivial task. <br><br>  Okay, the PC has computing power, you can contact the MC via radio or by wire and combine the power of a universal processor with powerful programming languages, the ability to process audio and video with interaction with the real world.  Wretched, but possible.  Yes, you will not go far from the computer, you can put a laptop on the platform, but such a robot will not be small, the autonomy is modest, fragile and clumsy.

    <h5>  And then came the Raspberry Pi </h5><br>  She combined the work with all standard tires of the microcontroller world - SPI, I2C, she has a UART, all this is available directly from her, and her modest appetites allow her to feed from a single 18650 element through a coin-sized booster!  Hooray, you can make a robot from a toy tank, a model car, from anything, you can directly work with accelerometers, barometers, GPS, gyroscopes, control servos.  And all this in one case.  And there is enough CPU power to stream a video stream from a USB camera over WiFi.  You can communicate with this robot over the network from another robot, PC or via the Internet.  It combines both low-level interfaces and the power of a universal processor and a real operating system, which can have the tasks of artificial intelligence, control of servo drives, motors, and anything you want. <br>  RPi is a computer and a microcontroller in one small board.  No wires, no radio interfaces for communication between logic and hardware, everything inside the tiny board, it fits on my little tracked robot and all it needs is a motor control module with which it can work directly.  Servos and LEDs - this is also possible. <br><br><h5>  Credit card sized computer </h5><br>  However, RPi was promoted as a laptop the size of a credit card, a video was shown on it, they played kvaka, in general they showed in every possible way that this was a good basis for the media center.  A sort of super cheap PC for everyone, plug in the TV, mouse and keyboard and you have a PC. <br><br><h5>  What really? </h5><br>  In fact, the RPi media core is really powerful, but as a general-purpose processor, it is barely a PII-300.  Wait for the launch of the epiphany browser - the whole event, programming on the raspberry itself in the graphic IDE is not the most pleasant thing.  She is leisurely by modern standards.  She does not have SATA, Ethernet one and that through USB bridge.  Everyone turned around disappointedly and began to consider alternatives. <br><br><h5>  But none of this is necessary! </h5><br>  For its application in the study of electronics, programming, building robots, it has everything you need, and the power is quite enough for a huge number of tasks.  In addition, it has audio output and video output, which allows you to connect not only a digital monitor, but also a small 4-7 "TV to display some information. You can connect a cheap Atmega168 microcontroller via the I2C or SPI bus for example and not occupy its only UART , which can be used to work with GPS or APC220 radio module. It is always good to have a choice. You can build a flexible and complex system. This is interesting. <br>  It would seem - an ideal board for robot builders and those interested in electronics, but the world of consumers looked at it as an ordinary low-powered computer, and in this role the raspberry is really homely. <br>  But you only think - before, any ARM board on which you could install Linux or Windows CE cost hundreds of dollars was inconvenient, there was little documentation, for example Gumstix.  They are difficult to buy, they are fragile, inconvenient for embedding.  Yes, for developers in large companies, these are pennies, but for the home, for the hobby, they are unsuitable. <br>  And now we have all this, at an affordable price - only about $ 55 with home delivery.  And nothing more is needed! <br><br>  Here is a simple example of how to quickly and easily get to the GPIO on Raspberry: <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/BILURH9XGTs%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhggAzp-_9kzvVeMcFZjYPPcEVxqNg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Sorry, for the quality of the video, it is dark in the evening, I did not manage to cover the aperture. <br><br>  So, any analogs only seem to be compact, most often this is only the basis, they need power supplies, radiators, expansion boards, it all costs often more than twice as much, poorly documented, unsuitable for robots and working with electronics directly. <br>  RPi is also not perfect, but it has practically no analogues in this area. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/161819/">https://habr.com/ru/post/161819/</a></p>
