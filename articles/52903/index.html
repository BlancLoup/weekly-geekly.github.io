  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Test services for creating short links</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <strong>Why was the topic written?</strong> <br><br>  Having once again experienced the need to use <a href="http://tinyurl.com/">TinyUrl</a> , I came across a threatening message that either the site is on the <a href="http://tinyurl.com/">blacklist</a> or my IP is banned.  Having tried to enter another address and having achieved the result, I came to the disappointing conclusion that such garbage is given by reference to the file on the Yandex hosting service.  A couple of minutes of search - and here the link is already safely cropped in <a href="http://moourl.com/">MooURL</a> .  Where did I get the MooURL?  But at random chose.  In his blog, in a <a href="http://promoinweb.ru/%3Fp%3D218">recording</a> of June 29, 2008, Artyom Belyaykin published a list of 68 services that he proposed to reduce the size of long links.  True, with an emphasis on masking affiliate links, and I rest against the user :) <br><br>  Since choosing at random is a way, after all, a little bit is not ours, it was decided to look through all the links and make a first impression about them in the form of an express review.  Along the way, it also became clear that half a year is already Term for the Network, and some of these sites no longer work.

      <strong>Why is this for a habrasoobshchestvu?</strong> <br><br>  For good.  And so as not to delve into it when needed.  It can be used for various reasons, for example: it is more convenient to write down such an address on a piece of paper;  by SMS it is more convenient to throw off;  it is more convenient to publish in social networks (when there is a ban on publishing addresses).  This is if you do not take into account the use for redirection and other options. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>What was done?</strong> <br><br>  Work has been done.  Not little.  By testing all links.  To test the possibilities, the site address ‚Äú <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/">http://habrahabr.ru/</a> ‚Äù was used.  In reality, of course, it is convenient in and of itself, but our goal is not to boast how long the addresses are shortened, but to immediately show how much better these short names are if they look bad / remembered / etc.  Although this does not apply to Habr :) Where you can set "preferences" (yes, it sounds awful), that is, links that include a user-defined combination of characters, used the preference "habr" or similar.  All ratings are subjective and based on my overall perception or non-perception of the site.  The main interface of the links is English (although German, French, Portuguese, etc. are found). <br><br>  I hope this review will help someone choose their resource necessary functionality.  So let's go. <br><br><br><h2>  Work after registration </h2><br>  <a href="http://www.digbig.com/">Digbig</a> <br>  The address is digbig.com/3bbd.  There are bookmarklets, statistics. <br>  <a href="http://lnk.in/">lnk.in</a> <br>  As it is written in the description, the site allows you to create links in the usual way, with the given combinations, in batch mode (when all valid links on the pages are replaced), as well as to place your own address translation button.  There are statistics and password protection links. <br>  <a href="http://nanoref.com/">NanoRef</a> <br>  Minimalistic interface, positioned as address substitutes for letters and chat.  It is possible to set preferences when creating an address of the form abcdef.nanoref.com. <br>  <a href="http://shurl.net/">Shurl</a> <br>  They say only about the availability of statistics and tracking links. <br>  <a href="http://www.sitelutions.com/">Sitelutions</a> <br>  The whole system for working with domains. <br><br><br><h2>  Work after registration (after choosing a domain) </h2><br>  <a href="http://ne1.net/">Ne1</a> <br>  The site works in an unusual pattern.  First, you choose one of the three domains, request its availability, then fill in your personal data - name, e-mail, password, website address and even its category.  For Habr, the address habr.r8.org could have been created if everything was not so dreary.  4/10. <br>  <a href="http://www.shim.net/index.phtml">Shim</a> <br>  The mechanism of work - like the Ne1.  A choice of seven domains.  Large registration form.  For Habr something would turn out like habr.2cd.net.  4/10. <br>  <a href="http://www.ulimit.com/en/">Ulimit</a> <br>  The mechanism of work - like the Ne1.  A selection of 26 domains.  Also a large registration form.  For Habr something would turn out like habr.it.st.  5/10. <br><br><br><h2>  Work </h2><br>  <a href="http://beam.to/start.asp">Beam.to</a> <br>  For the conversion, there is a button ‚ÄúAdd New URL‚Äù, then you must specify the combination-preference, the site and the mailbox.  For Habr, it would be something like "beam.to/habr" (did not convert).  Account system  Position yourself as a service to improve the appearance of your site's name "looking bad."  3/10. <br>  <a href="http://www.canurl.com/">CanURL</a> <br>  For Habr - canurl.com/ab5ys.  Cute  They are said to be optimized for mobile devices.  7/10. <br>  <a href="http://www.dwarfurl.com/">Dwarfurl</a> <br>  For Habr - dwarfurl.com/d2a70.  Allows you to optionally set a password to view the number of clicks on your link, has the option "can the link be publicly displayed."  Immediately generates the HTML code to insert the link.  8/10. <br>  <a href="http://get-shorty.com/">Get shorty</a> <br>  For Habr - get-shorty.com/shorty/habrahabr.  A site that claims to be stylish, but does not create the most convenient links.  Here, by the way, we are also offered something to download for offline work.  The keyword is set unless to further configure the address.  4/10. <br>  <a href="http://is.gd/">Is.gd</a> <br>  For Habr - is.gd/dCW.  Shows off how shortened the address.  If flash is enabled, the address is automatically copied to the buffer.  The instructions page has links to the corresponding bookmarklet, a plugin for Firefox and a widget for Mac OS X. Adding a hyphen address to the end (is.gd/dCW-) sends it to the link information page.  6/10. <br>  <a href="http://nutshellurl.com/">Nutshell URL</a> <br>  For Habr - nutshellurl.com/3t1.  The Google Custom Search field has been added to the main page.  Everything is simple and clear.  By entering the nutshell address in a special field, you can find out where it leads.  There is a kind of mascot - a crowd of walnuts :) 7/10. <br>  <a href="http://redirx.com/">Redirx</a> <br>  For Habr - redirx.com/?sg3o.  Sample slightly embellished minimalism.  On the main page there are a couple of words and a field for entering an address.  A link to the FAQ is found under the logo.  6/10. <br>  <a href="http://rubyurl.com/">RubyURL</a> <br>  For Habr - rubyurl.com/N8Yu.  The newly created link of choice can be immediately copied to the clipboard.  There is a bookmarklet and API (with examples).  8/10. <br>  <a href="http://shorl.com/">Shorl</a> <br>  For Habr - shorl.com/brygynihyfove.  After pressing the button, it produces an eerily-looking ‚Äúshort‚Äù address (‚Äúshorl‚Äù) and an awesome password to it (for using statistics).  There is a bookmarklet.  4/10. <br>  <a href="http://shorterlink.com/">Shoter link</a> <br>  Minimalism wisely: for Habr, he immediately honestly admitted that he would not do less address.  An example is shorterlink.com/?ABC123.  5/10. <br>  <a href="http://www.shorturl.com/">ShortURL</a> <br>  For Habr - alturl.com/53o.  Everything is motley, the abundance of parts is confusing.  Account system  There is a bookmarklet.  The task of combinations (and a couple of useful features) seems to be there, too, but it is very messy.  5/10. <br>  <a href="http://url.lotpatrol.com/">Short URL</a> <br>  For Habr - url.lotpatrol.com/?x=1855.  They say that by converting email addresses into their addresses they protect against web-spiders.  5/10. <br>  <a href="http://simurl.com/">Simurl</a> <br>  For Habr - simurl.com/matruw.  You can track statistics after registration.  After creating the link, it immediately tries to load the specified site into its frame.  6/10. <br>  <a href="http://smallr.com/">Smallr</a> <br>  For Habr - smallr.com/921.  Cute and minimalistic.  There is a bookmarklet and API.  8/10. <br>  <a href="http://tighturl.com/">Tight url</a> <br>  The unsightly interface is a mess of text.  For Habr did not give anything, apologizing.  Most likely, like Shoter Link, he simply concludes that the address will not do less.  But the details from the user hides.  There is a bookmarklet.  4/10. <br>  <a href="http://url.co.uk/">URL.co.uk</a> <br>  For Habr - url.co.uk/vrsdn.  Immediately, the HTML code and the insertion code are given on the forums.  Nice minimalistic interface.  8/10. <br>  <a href="http://url.ie/">URl.ie</a> <br>  For the link, a code is generated for the forums, a QR Code and the possible actions with a link are shown (forwarding, adding to bookmarks / social networks).  Easy interface, soft colors, a clover leaf in the background and interesting functionality.  What else does?  Bookmarklet?  He is.  9/10. <br>  <a href="http://wapurl.co.uk/">Wapurl</a> <br>  For Habr - wapurl.co.uk/?M0FC3EJ.  Address statistics, bookmarklets (FF, IE), API.  Soon promise to enter registration.  5/10. <br>  <a href="http://www.x.se/">X.se</a> <br>  For Habr - www.  x.se/dxf9 (just like that, with ‚Äúwww‚Äù, otherwise it gives out ‚ÄúNo DNS records‚Äù).  Site in Swedish, in which I am not strong, and therefore could miss something.  It works smartly and gives you a new address without rebooting.  It is also proposed to register a .se- or .asia-domain.  Everything.  5/10. <br>  <a href="http://yatuc.com/">YATUC</a> <br>  For Habr - yatuc.com/uub.  YATUC - "Yet Another Tiny Url Creator".  Statistics, link protection, password setting.  Redirect based on added levels.  Slightly driving interface in English and German.  6/10. <br>  <a href="http://piurl.com/">Pi URL</a> <br>  For Habr - piurl.com/1FiL.  Preview address, redirect with regard to level, API, bookmarklet.  Keywords in the address to describe it (added by the user when publishing links).  6/10. <br>  <a href="http://urlvi.be/">URLvi</a> <br>  For Habr - urlvi.be/mrshj.  Statistics are kept at the address, the password for it is set by the system, shown immediately on the conversion page, it is important not to view it.  There is a bookmarklet.  5/10. <br><br><br><h2>  Work with the given combinations </h2><br>  <a href="http://decenturl.com/">Decent URL</a> <br>  For Habr with preference - habrahabr.decenturl.com/habr.  Without preference - habrahabr.decenturl.com/half-decent-el3q.  Thus, for the second level domain name, the level of the site is set to DecentUrl, and after the slash the preference-combination (if specified) or arbitrary is placed.  The solution is not the best for simply shortening the address, but for a bad website address or for memorizing (rather than writing down meaningless combinations) the site can be convenient.  6/10. <br>  <a href="http://doiop.com/">Doiop</a> <br>  For Habr, with preference - doiop.com/habr, without preference - doiop.com/g39ct8.  6/10. <br>  <a href="http://easyurl.net/">EasyURL</a> <br>  For Habr with preference - atu.ca/habr.  Without preference, two options were issued - ecc.atu.ca and atu.ca/ecc.  It allows you to specify one of five domains on the basis of which the link will be created (the shortest one is atu.ca).  The site also has a bookmark service, registration by OpenID.  8/10. <br>  <a href="http://www.ezurl.eu/index.php">Ezurl</a> <br>  For Habr, with preference, ezurl.eu/habr, without preference, I did not work anymore.  A password is set to remove or edit the link in the future.  5/10. <br>  <a href="http://fhurl.com/">Fhurl</a> <br>  For Habr - fhurl.com/c3598.  Everything is ascetic and understandable.  In the top menu there was an inconspicuous link ‚ÄúCustom Url‚Äù (setting preferences), according to it - options for downloading the specified ‚ÄúRedirect‚Äù site (normal redirect; fhurl.com/habr) and ‚ÄúIframe‚Äù (frame, you can set Description and Keywords; fhurl. com / habr2).  6/10. <br>  <a href="http://www.fly2.ws/">Fly2</a> <br>  For Habr, with preference - fly2.ws/habr, without preference - fly2.ws/m887dbl.  AJAX interface without full page reload.  At hand - button to copy the resulting link to the clipboard.  Google Toolbar integration.  Account system  Looks pretty.  Have your mascot - bee.  They say about themselves that five times faster than TinyURL.  9/10. <br>  <a href="http://metamark.net/">Metamark</a> <br>  For Habr, with a preference (called Nickname here) - xrl.us/habrahabr (‚Äúhabr‚Äù was already taken).  Big minus - if the site has already been added to the database, you will only be offered already existing links (which may not be the most successful).  There is a dubious opportunity to add a ‚Äúsecret‚Äù to the urla (some kind of its own additional combination of characters).  There is a bookmarklet.  3/10. <br>  <a href="http://minilien.com/">Minilien</a> <br>  The French version of Tiny Link (similar description). <br>  <a href="http://moourl.com/">MooURL</a> <br>  For Habr - moourl.com/oh8j1.  The resulting link is immediately copied to the clipboard.  After creating a short link, the option ‚ÄúGive your moourl a personal touch‚Äù appears, under which the familiar task of preferences is hidden (for Habr a pleasant moourl.com/habr was created), after which both links work.  Looks pretty.  Have your own mascot - cow.  There is a bookmarklet.  In addition to the English, there is a Portuguese version of the site.  8/10. <br>  <a href="http://myurl.in/">MyURL</a> <br>  For Habr, with preference - myurl.in/habr, without preference - myurl.in/gdMVT.  There is a bookmarklet.  There is a batch rename mode, when you can specify several addresses at once, one per line.  Create a short address, anonymize and protect the address.  The site has the ability to create a mailbox in one click (in fact - in two) of the type abcdef@myurl.in for 24 hours.  9/10. <br>  <a href="http://notlong.com/">Not long</a> <br>  When specifying a mandatory combination of preferences, it seems that an address of the form abcdef.notlong.com is created (alas, three attempts for Habr failed).  It has its own statistics, bookmarklet and the ability to use API in Perl.  5/10. <br>  <a href="http://snipurl.com/">Snipurl</a> <br>  For Habr - snipurl.com/habra ("Habr" was already busy).  Have your bookmarklet, API, batch mode, account system.  Everything is nice and comfortable.  9/10. <br>  <a href="http://www.starturl.com/index.php">StartURL</a> For Habr issued - starturl.com/ooznk, scoring on a given alias.  There are statistics of the last five addresses and "Top 5 URLs".  4/10. <br>  <a href="http://www.tinylink.com/">Tiny link</a> <br>  For Habr - tinylink.com/?HvvDw2ko6O.  Minimalistic interface (like ya.ru), everything is just the most necessary.  After conversion, it allows you to quickly fill in the form for sending an address to 6 email addresses in the same window (specify your name, mailing address and comment only if you wish).  6/10. <br>  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/">Tinyll</a> <br>  For Habr - tinyurl.com/hhabr (‚ÄúHabr‚Äù was already busy), without preference (or if alias is busy), something like tinyurl.com/5wg2fs is offered.  One of the most famous resources of this kind.  I think it makes no sense to paint that there is a standard work with redirection, setting alias, previews, a button on the toolbar.  There is a black list on the circle of addresses to convert.  8/10. <br>  <a href="http://traceurl.com/">Traceurl</a> <br>  For Habr - traceurl.com/go/2/habr, without preference, the link looks similar.  There is a registration system with statistics, but for quick use it costs the use of the ‚ÄúDemo‚Äù account with the password ‚Äúdemo‚Äù (do not try to change it, it will not work).  Not the worst AJAX interface.  6/10. <br>  <a href="http://urlcut.com/">URLcut</a> <br>  For Habr urlcut.com/habr would turn out (there was no desire to deal with the slipped advertisement that prevented page loading).  There is password protection of the formed addresses.  3/10. <br>  <a href="http://urlhawk.com/">URLHawk</a> <br>  For Habr - urlhawk.com/habr, without preference - urlhawk.com/anf.  There is also a task password, hiding the destination address, tracking statistics.  6/10. <br>  <a href="http://6url.com/">6URL</a> <br>  For Habr immediately issued 6url.com/habr and habr.6url.com.  He attempted to create a short address without preference and answered that there already exists 66.135.52.151/habr.  Supports batch conversion (up to 6 addresses from the input field or from a given page).  There is a gadget for the homepage :) 6/10. <br>  <a href="http://www.urlpire.com/">URLPie</a> <br>  For Habr, urlpire.com/?habra (for preference, the ‚Äúidentifier‚Äù is given from 5 to 255 characters), remembers the previously added sites (gives the previously generated short addresses to the request).  Simple conversion.  5/10. <br><br><br><h2>  No longer work </h2><br>  <a href="http://301url.com/">301URL</a> .  Redirect on PRWeb.com, which reports that it is "is down for critical maintenance".

After clicking the button in Windows, it carefully asks if we really want to create a link.  And then drops out in Runtime Error (Server Error in '/' Application).  It's a shame. <br>  <a href="http://shrinkr.com/">Shrinkr</a> .  Server Failure: The name server was unable to process this query. <br>  <a href="http://shrinkurl.us/">ShrinkURL</a> .  The page cannot be found. <br>  <a href="http://www.shredurl.com/">ShredURL</a> .  The ‚ÄúShred This URL‚Äù button in my test browsers did not work.  At leisure, let's see why.

They didn‚Äôt want to let go, saying ‚ÄúMoviehole is currently having a lot of traffic.  We're working on it, and a solution for the future. ‚Äù <br>  <a href="http://xil.in/">Xil</a> .  At my workplace (from where I am writing now) I get ‚ÄúAccess denied‚Äù, but at home it does not enter at all. <br>  <a href="http://yep.it/">Yep it</a> .  Redirect to noipl.com (shows client IP and browser). <br><br><br><h2>  According to your requests :) </h2><br>  <a href="http://b23.ru/">B23</a> <br>  For Habr - b23.ru/uc.  Without setting preferences.  There is a bookmarklet and API.  An archive of your own (optional registration) and general link statistics (new, popular) are maintained.  OpenID access is possible.  Convenient, cute, fast.

There is a bookmarklet.  <a href="http://mindiver.habrahabr.ru/blog/52903/">SEO-friendly</a> .  8/10.  // thanks <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/matolch/" class="user_link">Matolch</a> <br><br><br><h2>  Results </h2><br>  So, we throw 17 non-working addresses out of this list, and we still have 51 resources (+ yours) in order to shred our long and not so much links.  Of course, such short texts of reviews are not suitable for the immediate selection of "their" resource.  Therefore, I will take the liberty to recommend something from this list. <br><br>  If you need a heavyweight system with a bunch of bells and whistles, then you should pay attention to <a href="http://easyurl.net/">EasyURL</a> , <a href="http://www.fly2.ws/">Fly2</a> , <a href="http://moourl.com/">MooURL</a> , <a href="http://myurl.in/">MyURL</a> , <a href="http://snipurl.com/">SnipURL</a> , <a href="http://tinyurl.com/">TinyURL</a> , <a href="http://zi.ma/">Zi.ma.</a> <br>  If you like the click-received interface, try <a href="http://b23.ru/">B23</a> , <a href="http://clck.ru/">Clck</a> (both in Russian!), <a href="http://www.dwarfurl.com/">Dwarfurl</a> , <a href="http://is.gd/">Is.gd</a> , <a href="http://nutshellurl.com/">Nutshell URL</a> , <a href="http://rubyurl.com/">RubyURL</a> , <a href="http://smallr.com/">Smallr</a> , <a href="http://url.co.uk/">URL.co.uk</a> , <a href="http://urlvi.be/">URLvi</a> . <br>  For some other purposes (for example, you want to have a bookmarklet or keep track of statistics) - see the description. <br><br>  PS Searching on Habr√©, I also <a href="http://dypa.habrahabr.ru/blog/42751/">found</a> <a href="http://tr.im/">Tr.im</a> , a pretty resource with a set of preferences for the address and a tie to Twitter. <br>  PPS I would be happy if you tell in the comments which resource or whose bookmarklet you are using and why, and also indicate the shortcomings of the descriptions - for example, sometimes the functions were hidden very far away and were not obvious.  By the way, I apologize for the bunch-a bunch of text and the lack of screenshots.  I say goodbye to this, good luck to everyone :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/52903/">https://habr.com/ru/post/52903/</a></p>
