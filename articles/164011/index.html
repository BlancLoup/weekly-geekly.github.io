Acer Aspire S7 Ultrabook Review</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It seems that it is not the first time when I feel that I am holding in my hands what should be the most indispensable gadget in everyday life.  Tablets, smartphones, laptops - well, that is what I can use every day not only for entertainment or work, but for entertainment and work.  The main problem of all the gadgets that I had had until now, I found that they were ideally suited only for one thing: either for use for business needs, or for entertainment.  Usually, the border, if not immediately noticed, then appeared on the second or third day of use.  Tablets in work are not convenient.  And laptops on the couch - bolshevat. <br>  And now, finally, I found something that was convenient for me to use always and everywhere. <br>  This is an ultrabook.  Touch Ultrabook Acer Aspire S7.  Down with compromises and separation of spheres.  All in one!  Hooray! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/286/817/ae3/286817ae3cac51dbe583f41849cc9ae5.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Main characteristics </h4><br>  Chipset: Intel HM77 <br>  Processor: Intel Core i5-3317U, 1.7 GHz <br>  Memory: 4 GB, DDR3 1600 MHz <br>  Disk: 128 GB SSD (RAID0) <br>  Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 4000 <br>  DVD drive: no <br>  Ports: 2xUSB 3.0, microHDMI, adapter for RJ-45 <br>  Wireless technologies: Wi-Fi (b / g / n), Bluetooth 4.0 <br>  Screen: 13.3 inches, 1920 x 1080, matrix Active Matrix TFT Color LCD, LED-backlit, glossy <br>  Battery: 4680 mAh, 4-cell <br>  Weight: 1.24 kg <br>  Dimensions: 322 x 224 x 12.3 mm <br>  Price: from 49 990 rubles <br><br><h4>  Equipment </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a67/021/3eb/a670213ebab11d247b8e330e4f419673.jpg"><br>  At that moment when I opened the Aspire S7 box - I understood - everything is already grown-up. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/efa/3bc/390/efa3bc390707bc63d675529c41230756.jpg"><br>  Everything in the box is laid neatly and everything is in place. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/09b/7bc/868/09b7bc8686b1fbd68d87ca97fc59c144.jpg"><br>  Even the case is included.  By the way, the case is very high quality, not leather, not suede.  Gray with velcro fastener. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/089/502/eff/089502effc5b0dc2588d943f18a8a75d.jpg"><br>  Ultrabook climbs there perfectly, even the possibility remains to carry in a case a couple of contracts or forms.  Convenient - no need to carry extra bags. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/afa/319/909/afa3199099d3fff9dfa8d1f86a36d7a5.jpg"><br>  Do not forget the same thing about such an important thing for a laptop as a mouse.  Not everyone loves touchpads - for such a fastidious white beautiful mouse.  The advantage of the mouse is that it works using bluetooth technology (the usb port will not be busy), as well as the laser sensor (apart from high accuracy there is no red light from the bottom of the mouse). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e92/128/5a1/e921285a15f1f1ee42585d62270c984e.jpg"><br>  The charger is small, white, with a narrow connection pin.  There are Velcro for coiling the wire. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/91e/ad3/f83/91ead3f8319d126d1d456f7f72379111.jpg"><br>  Also, in the box I found the adapter USB-Lan and micro-HDMI-D-Sub.  Both are stylish, white, beautiful. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b58/bb6/e7c/b58bb6e7c6b87fd1948d4d878ca3acbb.jpg">

    <h4>  Closer to the point </h4><br>  And so, we come to the most important thing - the ultrabook Aspire S7. <br>  In a nutshell: it's beautiful.  I‚Äôve got used to Apple dictates fashion long ago.  In smartphones it is an iPhone, in laptops (and ultrabooks) it is a MacBook.  So I expected to see something metallic, gray and dull (uh, no, nothing personal, just pall already).  So: this did not happen.  Opening the section of the box where the ultrabook was lying - I was stunned. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2f4/63e/60f/2f463e60fefb62dcf62b98686e893d07.jpg"><br>  Glass white top cover panel, white plastic case, aluminum hinges ... <br>  Opening the ultrabook, I also saw aluminum and glass.  The keys of the keyboard are plastic, but yes it does not matter.  It is important that all this looks very lively and original.  Body materials are very good.  The assembly is beautiful, no squeaks, no bends. <br>  I took the ultrabook in hand and realized that it was very thin (it turned out to be thinner than a macbook air) - 12.3 mm!  It is very cool!  The weight of 1.24 kg for the 13 inch is a feather.  Despite the materials, the engineers managed to keep the ultrabook light!  The device dimensions are as follows: 322 * 224 mm.  Get plenty of A4 paper, well, so this is 13 inch!  In addition, the glass that is used in the design turned Gorilla Glass 2!  And this means that it is not just beautiful, it is very durable!  This adds to the laptop on the item "strength" immediately a hundred points!  And on the item "style" - a thousand! <br>  The glowing logo constantly reminded me of something, but I still did not understand what ... <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ef1/0ad/dbd/ef10addbde8a45425fb52e6cdfe610ca.jpg"><br>  If you walk along the thin ultrabook, then you can find: on the left side of the connector for the charger, micro-HDMI port, headphone jack and the power button. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ad7/2d0/92c/ad72d092c4fa5c3cb70f2f8202a4dba9.jpg"><br>  The right side has two USB 3.0 ports, as well as an SD-MMC card reader. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fb8/6e3/927/fb86e392724df2871becad94f853bd35.jpg"><br>  There are ventilation grilles on the back and that's it. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/99a/1fc/899/99a1fc8998384d38ab428e1b3b3c7e29.jpg"><br>  At the bottom of the laptop, in addition to the rubber feet, there are two speakers, an air intake grille, as well as cap screws. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5e8/b87/a86/5e8b87a86ed3260e83162cdbef5f21f0.jpg"><br>  In addition, I found two interesting fasteners (threaded connections).  Googling a bit, I learned that there is one interesting accessory for an ultrabook - an extra battery.  It attaches to the bottom and performs four functions at once: the first actually increases the operating time, the second makes the tilt of the ultrabook more steep, makes it easier to print, the third makes it easier to take the ultrabook, and the fourth makes it easier for the air to enter the ventilation system and not clog up dust. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1b5/8a7/ba4/1b58a7ba42af963f20ce0eabd96060a2.jpg"><br>  The keyboard here is also unusual.  That is, as - the usual keys (16 * 16 mm), gray.  There is a key illumination (for some reason green), with automatic adjustment. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dac/2be/a75/dac2bea757d122f5d25d3de74452fb3c.jpg"><br>  The unusual thing is that the keyboard lacks a number of F-buttons.  Their functions are transferred to ordinary numeric keys. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5cf/303/e7a/5cf303e7a54f92306113d982bdd94e53.jpg"><br>  In addition, the Caps Lock button is truncated;  due to its decrease, the ‚Äú~ (E)‚Äù button was placed next to it.  A strange decision, but in my life it did not stop me.  I have long been used to the long Enter and slash over it, as well as to small arrows. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8e7/c43/47e/8e7c4347e28d4aad58b107fa1c644fe6.jpg"><br>  But the touchpad is what you need - 60 * 116 mm, glass, multi-touch, everything is just like people! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ab4/1a4/c52/ab41a4c5265f31597a17338eceede10b.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Trumps </h4><br>  Well, okay, what are we all around?  The main advantage of the ultrabook is not in all this!  And in the touch FullHD display! <br>  Yes, you were not mistaken: the display is finally FullHD.  The resolution for 13 inches is more than enough (let the apple lovers remain silent for now).  In some places I even had to suffer: increase the font in the browser and in the system.  Too small.  But this is more of a plus - more is possible - less is impossible. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c54/b9d/ec3/c54b9dec30e2b3be57d02a37bc94cf95.png"><br>  Secondly, as you already understood, the matrix of the display of the Active Matrix TFT Color LCD - this means excellent viewing angles (178 degrees), brightness, chromaticity and contrast.  My screen is not that startled.  But the screen quality is very good.  At least the terrible TN 1366 * 768 I forgot as a nightmare.  The display has a very small frame (Frameless), as well as it is very thin (that is, there is no layer between the glass and the display), everything looks more vivid and feels nice. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/645/097/d0b/645097d0b9a51ed09fd6cd3a54308cd8.jpg"><br>  Thirdly, yes!  Touch screen!  10-finger multitouch.  That's cool!  Cool by the fact that, coupled with Windows 8, it gives you almost perfect work in any way you use an ultrabook.  After all, as we already learned with you, if you do not like touchpads and touch screens, then there is a mouse for you. <br><br>  Also, so that you can fully experience the capabilities and benefits of the touchscreen, the laptop lid opens on ... somewhere 190 degrees (more than full). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/78c/81c/64e/78c81c64ec367b2d3b8782ba22c5e6cf.jpg"><br><br>  Above the screen is a camera and a light sensor (adjusts the keyboard backlight). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/42e/575/530/42e575530b7d619b18f6811f61fdf4e6.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Formative force </h4><br>  Stuffing in ultrabook - appropriate.  Here you and the latest processor from Intel - core i5 3317U, and the fastest SSD.  Everything so that Windows showed the maximum rating ... which, unfortunately, it could not do. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/094/ca6/ddd/094ca6ddd0ceb494bc764291e1be4908.png"><br>  Well, never mind.  In my opinion, these indicators are quite good for themselves.  5.4 - and that, only because of the graphics (it is built-in Intel HD4000). <br>  If you turn synthetics, then PCMark gave out about 4,700 parrots, and 3dMark - 616 marks.  Is it a lot or a little?  I do not know.  But for my tasks it is good. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/57a/8fe/3e9/57a8fe3e9c6509e27350606a501d1d53.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/33d/17c/23d/33d17c23ddfa2ee05a1c182279dcefa5.png"><br>  The read and write speed of SSD reached 907 and 363 MB respectively.  But in reality, this meant a reboot in seconds and a half seconds out of sleep. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/222/284/e0d/222284e0db0a318f0c1cdf43c0c86450.png"><br>  Of course, seeing the thickness, weight and filling involuntarily ask yourself: how long will it last?  The answer will be as follows: I did not receive 11 hours certified by the manufacturer, but when I worked on the Internet I received 5.5 hours.  And with a load (the benchmark was spinning without stopping at maximum brightness), the ultrabook hung for 1.5 hours!  This is not that good - it is very good in my opinion! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7e9/9b7/74d/7e99b774d680abf6a566a9fcf5fc25b5.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/18e/b39/ce1/18eb39ce129cf5d4043d6911ba816193.png"><br><br>  Unfortunately, with the load, I found a lack of such a good device.  The processor heats up, the cooler turns on ... and buzzes.  Humming loud enough.  The film, of course, does not drown out, but when working in silence you can hear it very much.  But, fortunately, he quickly copes with the task and becomes silent.  The system, albeit loud, but very effective. <br><br>  The operating system is Windows 8. I think that readers have long been acquainted with it.  I‚Äôll tell you that Acer, as usual, didn‚Äôt stuff the system with all kinds of nastiness, but put only an antivirus and a couple of its proprietary utilities. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f1c/ae8/b52/f1cae8b5229f0ee0ec152c80c8db5c29.png"><br>  Office, unfortunately, is not installed.  Only link to the trial.  Well, yes, I myself can! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/82d/be7/e6b/82dbe7e6bf3a480255f5a194e12981bd.png"><br>  For the sake of interest, I downloaded some benchmark from the Windows store and drove it away.  What do these numbers mean - I do not know yet. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/418/f5d/784/418f5d78496eb023ba1e53fa3060bb92.png"><br><br><h4>  Results </h4><br>  In general, I was very pleased with the ultrabook.  Is that from the side of the cooler noise a bit annoying, well, I caught a small software glitch: on the home network (TP-Link router) Wi-Fi sometimes disappears for a minute.  He himself appears.  At work, this did not notice.  Yes, and the ugly keyboard - of course in the minus unit. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/193/731/cc5/193731cc51ed51ec8e113e4348b925cd.jpg"><br>  As usual - about the price at the last moment.  <a href="">From 50 thousand rubles</a> - in my opinion, an ultrabook costs this money, but for this price there are more than enough competitors (and each will have its own advantages and disadvantages). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/164011/">https://habr.com/ru/post/164011/</a></p>
