  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The most interesting startups in runet - spring 2008</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  By the nature of my work, I regularly monitor interesting Web 2.0 startups in runet.  This time, I decided to share my vision with habrau users and tell you about the brightest startups launched in spring 2008.  For each of the startups, we will touch on possible monetization channels and discuss investment rumors. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  When choosing startups, which can be attributed to the spring of 2008, I was guided by the presence of references to the startup on specialized resources during this period, as well as functional readiness. <br><table><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/a16/9f2/d6a/a169f2d6a6ecb398879aca3c0dd2001c.png" width="145" height="53" alt="BestPersons.ru" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br></td><td><h2>  BestPersons.ru </h2><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  The computer allows you to solve problems that before the invention of the computer did not exist.  Similarly, the BestPersons service allows you to solve a problem that did not exist before the invention of social networks - combining dozens of accounts on other social networks.  About two years ago we would have said that the problem was sucked from the finger.  Now in my password manager there is a special daddy - ‚ÄúSocial Networks‚Äù, which contains dozens of elements.  Yes, it turns into a nightmare: if friends, then immediately everywhere, if you post, then immediately in LiveJournal, in Liveinternet, and in Blogspot, and in a separate blog.  The idea to make a universal business card in the network, where everyone could post information about themselves was vital for a long time, but BestPersons.ru chose the most correct and relevant approach - the aggregation of already existing information. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/860/d59/f8b/860d59f8b1efb46c1384156dd731db3a.jpg" width="450" height="341" alt="BestPersons.ru" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  <strong>Investment Information:</strong> according to rumors&gt; 500 thousand USD <br>  <strong>Possible startup problems: it is</strong> likely that the portal will be used as a means of searching for information about users, and registered users will rarely visit the portal, which will lead to a lack of a regular audience and an increase in the budget for promotion. <br>  <strong>Ways to solve problems: the</strong> introduction of a large number of own social services <br>  <strong>Probable monetization model:</strong> advertising, due to the add.  services.  Successful monetization will require attracting a large number of participants.

      <strong>Project website:</strong> <a href="http://www.bestpersons.ru/">www.BestPersons.ru</a> <br><table><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/604/ef0/11d/604ef011dd40b25daa29784ec89786b3.jpg" width="265" height="255" alt="NashOfis.ru" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br></td><td><h2>  NashOfis.ru </h2><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  The idea to create a social network for office employees has long been on the surface.  And if business social networks, such as MoiKrug and Webby, have long occupied their niches, there are still no entertainment networks, but a typical office plankton spends more than 50% of its time not at work, but at eternal gatherings on the Internet .  What, by the way, and says a sharp surge in attendance Runet on weekdays. <br><br>  At the end of April, the first startup on this topic, <a href="http://www.shefa-net.ru/">www.shefa-net.ru</a> , <a href="http://www.shefa-net.ru/">appeared</a> , and the developers of Our Office apparently decided not to wait for the development of a competitor and launched an early beta, NashOfis.ru, which was still ‚Äúraw‚Äù, but very functional. <br><br>  The service is designed to find colleagues, to post and discuss corporate photo albums.  There is a huge number of ‚Äúmonitor panels‚Äù informing you about the change of jobs of your friends and colleagues.  In ‚ÄúOur office‚Äù a lot of attention is paid to communication within companies: employees can communicate both using the private messaging system and in the meeting rooms. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/8c1/90d/2b3/8c190d2b3c4a69af1ef4b9ad449ed5c5.jpg" width="450" height="472" alt="NashOfis.ru" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  <strong>Investment information:</strong> according to rumors about 120 thousand euros were spent on development. <br>  <strong>Possible startup problems: it is</strong> likely that users who are interested in communicating via social networks have long been communicating on ‚Äúclassmates‚Äù or ‚ÄúVKontakte‚Äù and the new service will not be of interest to them. <br>  <strong>Solutions to problems: the</strong> introduction of a large number of unique "office" services. <br>  <strong>Probable monetization model:</strong> advertising, due to the add.  services.  The advertising model seems the most likely and successful, because  office employees are the most active consumers of goods and services. <br><br>  <strong>Project website:</strong> <a href="http://www.nashofis.ru/%3Fus7043">www.NashOfis.ru/?us7043</a> <br><table><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/0cf/6f9/697/0cf6f9697608ba368acf853ec84731ed.jpg" width="269" height="56" alt="Tripster.ru" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br></td><td><h2>  Tripster.ru </h2><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  WikiMapia laurels do not give rest to anyone, and this is an extra push to the development of services ‚Äúon the map‚Äù.  Tipster is a travel service that actively uses Google Maps and Flickr in its work.  The idea is very simple: you mark on the world map those places where you visited your tourist trips and make your own individual travel map.  Each locality or country has its own page on the project, where travelers can ask questions and answer them.  On the pages of localities, photos from flickr are automatically uploaded, which is very convenient.  And also available brief information about other travelers. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/ce1/7a5/eea/ce17a5eea5387d660f9d0084e0ed666c.jpg" width="450" height="333" alt="Tripster.ru" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  <strong>Information about investments:</strong> according to the creators, a lot of money was not invested in the project, and it is developed without an investor.  According to my assumptions, the project budget is &lt;10,000 USD. <br>  <strong>Possible problems of a startup:</strong> tourist trips are usually planned 1-2-3 times a year, and after a trip people often ‚Äúleave‚Äù tourism for 2-3 months.  This can lead to the fact that the core of visitors to the site will be extremely small, and a large amount of investment will be required to attract new users. <br>  <strong>Solutions to problems:</strong> integration with other travel services. <br>  <strong>Probable monetization model:</strong> advertising (offer tours). <br><br>  <strong>Project website:</strong> <a href="http://www.tripster.ru/">www.tripster.ru</a> <br><br>  Separately, I would like to note the actively developing project Mooteam.ru, which would definitely get into this review, if it were launched a little earlier, as well as promenyal.ru - a service that allows you to get rid of unnecessary things, exchanging them for something more necessary :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/25927/">https://habr.com/ru/post/25927/</a></p>
