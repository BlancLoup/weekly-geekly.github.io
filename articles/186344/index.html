Today July 11th is World Chocolate Day. <br>  I wanted to please the audience reading this post with some kind of electronic devices enclosed in just_for_fun chocolate case. <a name="habracut"></a>  Quite real, if you keep such a device at a low temperature and not gnaw it.  However, it was not possible to find the people who committed such an author of this article (either I was searching this way or the madmen were ending).  Therefore, I offer your review completely chocolate "devices", the contemplation of which should cause you joy, a possible nostalgia, but most importantly the desire to go buy a chocolate bar and stimulate your brain by eating it (about the miraculous properties of chocolate to stimulate the brain at the end of the article). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/473/547/d4d/473547d4dee69cce0e79d551d4a407be.jpg" alt="image"><br>  And what would you have eaten the button first, if you had such a chocolate keyboard? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/97a/fe8/9ac/97afe89ac81a8eab02bb10be5cd23489.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Nintendo joystick.  Many here probably wanted to break it in a fit of passion, and some probably did.  The author of this work boasts that he ate the joystick.  And you did not become jealous? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/87c/4e1/ebc/87c4e1ebcf989a0b9b73e47b51991eaf.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ace/285/572/ace2855725fa6dcae980b1d765bd8d56.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a54/cfc/a88/a54cfca887c4fb61e47e551d7b663b04.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Such cute candy makes Parisian confectionary firm Chocographics.  Have you ever had an iPhone?  Order this option for only $ 15-20 and eat with pleasure (ps sweets with four different fillings).

Those who screw nuts also love chocolate. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/339/c02/540/339c025400f889e9c5207d991c92cafe.jpg" alt="image"><br>  For only $ 2, we are offered to buy and chew a calculator.  You are already looking for him, yes? <br><br>  While wandering around the Internet you can also find chocolate: shoes (and other types of clothing), nails, vinyl records, a model of formula 1, the human brain, and much more.  Fantasy chocolate confectioners inexhaustible.  And you did not want to blind any of this sweet thick dark (or maybe light) mass? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/52d/f9e/02e/52df9e02e7fbb377578659c3ffb3d176.jpg" alt="image"><br>  For simplicity, you have a 3D Imagine 3D printer from Essential Dynamics. <br>  Imagine 3D is not an ordinary printer, because its cartridges can be filled with chocolate (as well as cheese, silicone, epoxy and concrete). <br><br>  In continuation of the theme of real electronic devices it is impossible to ignore the chocolate-like body of various gadgets. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/061/c60/d8e/061c60d8e9901ae2b29e81180313f66c.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Perhaps your appetite is designed to awaken a new product from Century: users are offered to disguise an external 2.5-inch HDD under a chocolate bar. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a8d/412/54a/a8d41254a8273720633f885cf66a6bad.jpg" alt="image"><br>  In fact, this "tile" is a silicone case for the hard drive with external dimensions of 73 x 15 x 110 mm.  How nice to carry with you a huge chocolate bar, but look not to chip off the tile! <br><br>  Sharp Q-Pod: Chocolate Smartphone. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/be3/d35/460/be3d354604950858b9132fc9e824c550.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Some numbers: the phone‚Äôs stuffing is a Snapdragon gigahertz processor, 512 MB RAM, 8 megapixel camera.  The 3.7-inch screen has a resolution of 960 x 540. I wonder if the Sharp Q-Pod operating system version is Android Gingerbread (‚Äúgingerbread‚Äù) ... Most likely, this wonderful smartphone did not get to us: it is released among only 3000 instances.  But maybe on Habr√© there is an owner of this device?  In comments please! <br><br>  You can continue the chocolate theme for a long time, gentlemen (which I hope to see in the comments), but do not forget that chocolate is not only beautiful and tasty, but also useful. <br>  It was like this: 9-00 am, convulsive crush in front of the audience, in which the next exam will be held, and in the hands of a pen, a bottle of water and ... chocolate. <br><br>  Does chocolate take a part in your daily diet?  After all, how many articles have already been written by British scientists about its indispensable utility.  However, in reality, the presence of flavanols in bitter chocolate stimulates blood flow to the brain.  Chocolate, as a natural nootrop (these are agents that have a direct activating effect on learning, improve memory and mental activity, Wicky), stimulates blood flow to areas of the brain that are responsible for memory and responsiveness.  This study was conducted by Mars inc.  Like other sweet foods, chocolate stimulates the release of endorphins, natural hormones that give us a feeling of happiness and well-being. <br>  All happiness, joy and fun on this not a significant holiday - Chocolate Day! <br>  ps And of course all chocolate. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/186344/">https://habr.com/ru/post/186344/</a></p>
