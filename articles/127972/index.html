Initially, it was created as a tool for musicians, but in its more than twenty years of history it turned into a universal tool that allows to solve any tasks related to sound, image and interaction with a person or equipment.  Most often it is used to create interactive installations, algorithmic music and visuals, although, thanks to the open API and the ability to write your own objects, it can be used for any purpose that requires working in real-time.  Here, for example, is an installation built on one of the buildings in the Italian city of Cagliari.  The color of LED displays varies with car noise and is controlled by a bunch of <i>Max / MSP</i> and <i>Arduino</i> . <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/14085912&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiszOZKz_Mxu0XBrTg69plfe9xT4w" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="Tlight" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  A bit of history </h4><br>  The first version of Max, the direct descendant of which is described in this article, was written by <i>Miller Puckett</i> in the late 80s when he worked at <i>IRCAM (Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique / Musique, Institute for Research and Coordination of Acoustics and Music)</i> .  At that time there were collected the best minds of the world engaged in research in the field of computer music, among which, in particular, was <i>Max Matthews</i> , the pioneer of electronic music, the man who created the first music program <i>MUSIC I.</i>

      The name <i>Max</i> was given in his honor, however it was done not for his services, but because he developed the <i>‚Äúreal-time scheduling‚Äù</i> algorithm <i>RTSKED</i> , which was the basis of <i>Miller‚Äôs</i> program.  Its essence is as follows: the calculations take place in several parallel elements that perform something for a while, then inform the system about the completion, after which they remain idle until a trigger signal is received.  This is the fundamental idea of <i>max</i> (program). <br><br>  But Max did not always know how to work with audio due to the low computing power of old processors.  Initially, such an opportunity appeared in the <i>PureData</i> program, which <i>Miller</i> wrote after leaving <i>IRCAM</i> and based on ideas that he had laid down earlier.  It was in her first opportunity to synthesize sound in real time ( <i>Max / FTS</i> does not count, because it used a special DSP card for the synthesis).  Shortly after the creation of <i>Pd, David Zicarelli</i> , the founder of <i>Cycling'74</i> , decides to add audio to the original max, which is what made <i>Max / MSP</i> appear.  For the synthesis, it uses the <i>PureData</i> infrastructure, to which features taken from <i>Max / FTS</i> but not implemented in <i>Pd</i> were added. <br><br>  A bit later, <i>Cycling'74</i> created <i>Jitter</i> , a set of objects that allow real-time work with video, 3D and OpenGL, based, if I'm not mistaken, on <i>GridFlow</i> , a similar development for <i>jMax</i> , the direct heir to <i>Max / FTS</i> . <br><br>  Let's sum up.  <i>Max</i> is a visual programming environment, the foundation of everything;  <i>MSP</i> is an extension that makes it possible to work with audio, and <i>Jitter</i> is an extension for working with video.  Hence the name - <i>Max / MSP / Jitter</i> . <br><br>  Max has a very long history, for whom it is interesting, it is better to read Miller's <a href="http://www-crca.ucsd.edu/~msp/Publications/dartmouth-reprint.dir/">article</a> - who, if not the creator, will describe ee better?  We need to take the first steps ... <br><br><h4>  Getting Started </h4><br>  First, we analyze some of the basics.  The program in max is called a <i>patch</i> .  To create a <i>patch,</i> it is necessary to connect various modules using virtual wires (they are usually called <i>objects</i> ), as a rule, performing simple functions such as arithmetic, sorting, MIDI processing, wave synthesis, and so on.  Each <i>object</i> has entrances and exits, which we will further call <i>inlets</i> and <i>outlets</i> .  I will tell you more about everything in one of the following articles, and I‚Äôll limit myself to just step-by-step instructions for creating a small random sequencer that controls a simple synthesizer. <br><br>  So, in order to get started, you need to install the program by downloading the latest demo version from the official site <a href="http://cycling74.com/">cycling74.com</a> .  After a successful launch, the <i>Max window</i> will appear on the screen - the <i>Max</i> service window, where errors and other system messages are displayed. <br><br><img src="http://pattr.ru/img/maxmsp_review/max_window.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Now you can create an empty <i>patcher</i> - a window in which you will collect your first <i>patch</i> .  This is done from the menu <i>File&gt; New Patcher (Ctrl N)</i> . <br><br>  An empty <i>patcher</i> opened before us.  <i>Max</i> tells us to double click on an empty spot.  This action will open the <i>object palette</i> - a small menu from which you can select <i>an object</i> .  Personally, I find it inconvenient, since it is much faster to add an object using the keyboard.  To do this, press the <i>‚Äún‚Äù</i> button to create an empty object <i>(object box)</i> , in which you must enter the name of the object and press <i>enter</i> .  In this way, we will create three objects: <b>toggle</b> , <b>button</b> and <b>[metro 300]</b> and connect them, as shown in the figure. <br><br><img src="http://pattr.ru/img/maxmsp_review/step_1.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The <b>toggle</b> and <b>button</b> objects miraculously turned into cute buttons.  Their difference is that the first is a switch, and the second plays the role of a trigger.  Now we leave the edit mode by clicking on the lock in the lower left corner of the screen, and click on the <b>toggle</b> object.  As a result, the <b>button</b> should flash.  What is going on?  When turned on, the <b>toggle</b> object sends the unit to the left inlet of the object [metro 300], which turns on and starts generating a special <i>bang</i> trigger message every <i>300</i> milliseconds and transmitting it to the <b>button</b> , causing the latter to blink.  By the way, the <b>[metro 300]</b> object is a <b>metro</b> object with one <i>argument of 300</i> .  <i>Arguments</i> specify the initial parameters of the objects. <br><br>  Now turn off the <b>toggle</b> and go back to edit mode.  Add three objects: <b>[random 24]</b> , <b>[+ 48]</b> and <b>number</b> and connect, as shown in the figure: <br><br><img src="http://pattr.ru/img/maxmsp_review/step_2.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Now turn on the <b>toggle</b> again and see what happens.  As mentioned earlier, the <b>[metro 300]</b> object generates a <i>bang</i> every <i>300</i> milliseconds.  This <i>bang</i> enters the object <b>[random 24]</b> , forcing which to generate a random number in the range <i>0 ... 23</i> .  Then, using the object <b>[+ 48], we</b> add to the output of the random <i>48</i> , thereby obtaining at the output a range of <i>48 ... 71</i> .  The generated numbers are displayed in the <b>number</b> object (called the <i>number box</i> ), which displays integer values. <br><br>  Moving on, now we will generate sound.  To do this, we need to add four more objects: <b>mtof</b> , <b>cycle ~</b> , <b>gain ~</b> and <b>ezdac ~</b> .  I want to note that in all cases in the names of objects the tilde mark is obligatory - this agreement, adopted in <i>max</i> , allows to distinguish <i>MSP</i> objects (which work with audio) from ordinary ones.  Yes, by the way, initially the object <b>gain ~</b> had a vertical view, in this <i>patch</i> I changed it by simply hovering the cursor on the lower right corner of the object and stretching it to the desired size, as is done with the windows of my favorite OS.  Pay attention to the new striped wires - this is how the wires through which the <i>MSP</i> signal is transmitted look like. <br><br><img src="http://pattr.ru/img/maxmsp_review/step_3.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Once again, exit edit mode (for those who have already forgotten, this is done using the lock icon in the lower left corner), turn on <b>toggle</b> , drag the <b>gain ~</b> slider to the right and click on <b>ezdac ~</b> .  A sound should appear.  If this does not happen, go to Settings <i>&gt; DSP Status ...</i> and select the desired audio driver and audio interface.  For our example, the <i>ad_mme</i> driver is quite appropriate, since <i>asio is</i> not needed for such simple work.  When I select zvukovuhi max hieroglyphs, so here you may have to experiment, but practice shows that the very first device in the list is usually suitable.  After all the manipulations, you must again click on <b>ezdac ~</b> to enable <i>MSP</i> . <br><br><img src="http://pattr.ru/img/maxmsp_review/dsp_status.png" alt="image"><br><br>  So, we deviated a little, we still have to explain how everything works.  In the previous <i>patch,</i> we stopped at generating random numbers in the range of <i>48 ... 71</i> .  We feed these numbers into the <b>mtof</b> object, it understands the numbers <i>0 ... 127</i> as MIDI notes and transforms them into the appropriate frequency.  For example, note number <i>60</i> has a frequency of <i>261 Hz</i> , note <i>70</i> - <i>466 Hz,</i> and so on.  This value enters the <b>cycle ~</b> object and sets it to the frequency of the generated sine wave.  Then the signal enters the object <b>gain ~</b> , which allows you to change the amplitude, and then goes to the speakers through the <b>ezdac ~</b> object (short for <i>easy digital audio converter</i> ), which does two things: it actually outputs audio to the speakers and turns <i>MSP</i> on / off. <br><br>  Go ahead.  Now add an <i>ADSR</i> -bending for amplitude.  To do this we need the following objects: <b>[trigger f 1]</b> , <b>adsr ~</b> , <b>* ~</b> (multiplication of signals), three <b>number</b> and one <b>flonum</b> .  Now connect all together: <br><br><img src="http://pattr.ru/img/maxmsp_review/step_4.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The structure has slightly changed, we will analyze everything here.  The output from <b>mtof</b> now goes to the <b>[trigger f 1]</b> object, which, when a message arrives at it, first outputs the unit from the right outlet, thereby forcing <b>adsr ~ to</b> generate a new envelope, and then output the number entered into it through the left outlet.  From the arguments everything should be clear: <i>f</i> - means <i>float</i> , and <i>1</i> - <i>one</i> .  Here one important feature of all <i>objects</i> is used - the display of messages starts from the <i>right outlet</i> and in turn to the <i>left</i> .  I will tell you more about this next time, as this is not included in the scope of the introductory article.  Let's go back to the patch.  As it has already become clear, <b>adsr ~</b> generates an envelope, the parameters of which are set using four namber boxes.  Important: the parameters <i>attack</i> , <i>decay</i> and <i>release</i> are specified in milliseconds, therefore for their cases the <b>number</b> objects were used.  For convenience, the range of these values ‚Äã‚Äãwas limited to <i>0 ... 1000</i> in the inspector, which is invoked by right-clicking on an object and invoking the Inspector menu. <br><br><img src="http://pattr.ru/img/maxmsp_review/inspector.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The <i>sustain</i> parameter sets the amplitude, therefore its range of values ‚Äã‚Äãconsists of real numbers <i>0 ... 1.0</i> .  That is why instead of <b>number the</b> object <b>flonum</b> is used - it is completely identical to <b>number</b> , it only allows you to work with real numbers.  By the way, the minimum and maximum of it are also limited through the inspector to <i>0</i> and <i>1,</i> respectively. <br>  Finally, the signal from <b>adsr ~</b> multiplies with the signal <b>cycle ~</b> and is output to the columns.  That's it, your first patch is ready!  Easy, isn't it? <br><br><h4>  What's next? </h4><br>  I did not intend this article to paint all the subtleties of working with max, since it is simply impossible to fit in ten A4 pages (this is exactly how much my article takes in a Word).  I wanted to give only a general idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis wonderful program, showing the principle of work in it, while trying not to slip into insanity and worthlessness (many thanks to everyone who helped me in this).  If there is interest, I can write a series of articles in which I will detail in detail the important things of Max (types of messages, sequence of events, etc.), and who do not have the patience to wait for this, I cite the main directions for self-study. <br><br>  Firstly, tutorials that come with max and are available from the <i>Help</i> menu are required to read.  They contain in detail and consistently all the fundamental things necessary for work.  Max has great documentation, to be honest, I haven't seen anything like it in other programs.  What are only interactive examples for each object. <br><br>  Secondly, on the official website of <a href="http://cycling74.com/">cycling74.com</a> there are a lot of small video lessons showing various "chips".  Also there is the world's largest forum dedicated to this program;  if there are difficulties, it is better to use the search on the forum: most likely this situation has already arisen in someone before. <br><br>  Although these two resources are plenty to explore, I was once helped by the book <i>Programming Electronic Music in Pd</i> by <i>Johannes Kreidler</i> , although it is dedicated to <i>PureData</i> (in fact, there are more similarities than differences between <i>Pd</i> and <i>Max</i> ).  The book is published in the public domain, the English translation can be read on the <a href="http://www.pd-tutorial.com/english/index.html">link</a> . <br><br>  And I would like to mention two Russian-speaking resources: <br>  1. <a href="http://maxmsp.ru/">http://maxmsp.ru</a> - site created by Dmitry Dubrov and Dmitry Letakhovsky, known by the project Fizzarum; <br>  2. <a href="http://pattr.ru/">http://pattr.ru</a> is a blog that we support with friends, created to, to some extent, compensate for the lack of Russian-language material on the Max / MSP and PureData programs. <br><br>  Also, it is worth scrolling tutorials on max made by comrade <a href="http://soundcloud.com/phoiod">Phoiod</a> , for convenience, I <a href="http://www.scribd.com/collections/3233997/Max-tutors-translated-by-phoiod">uploaded</a> them to <a href="http://www.scribd.com/collections/3233997/Max-tutors-translated-by-phoiod">scribd</a> .  They are on the fourth max, but for study it is quite suitable, especially if the English is tight. <br><br>  For now.  Happy Patching!  :) <br><br>  Archive with patches can be downloaded from the <a href="">link</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/127972/">https://habr.com/ru/post/127972/</a></p>
