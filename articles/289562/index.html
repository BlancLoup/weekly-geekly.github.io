The online chat market is outdated.  It would seem that most companies only recently started using them, and here they are saying - ‚Äú <i>everything is outdated and requires new solutions</i> .‚Äù  And it seems like you can't argue ... What exactly is outdated and what new solutions are necessary for effective communication with customers?  Let's get a look‚Ä¶ <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We analyzed the market of online consultants for sites and came to the conclusion that in many ways they simply repeat each other.  It is not surprising that more and more articles appear on the Internet about the inefficiency of chat.  This is not quite an objective opinion.  Rather, it is outdated exactly what services provide, their approach.  In the previous article we have already discussed the <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/carrotquest/blog/13960/">primary problems</a> .  Let's go further‚Ä¶ <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/155/48e/69a/15548e69a96302451b58897f87e98202.jpg" alt="image003" width="820" height="382"></a>

    <br>  Leaders have already felt the change in the market and are happy to use new solutions, running ahead.  Most companies, unfortunately, do not have time for them.  Many are forced to succumb to the most common proposals, because an article describing outdated solutions is very much. <br><br><h3>  <b>1. Criteria of the past</b> </h3><br>  The main criteria that today corresponds to the online chat market: <br><ul><li>  The ability to insert a photo operator </li><li>  Design customization </li><li>  Active invitations </li><li>  Statistics on visitors (where it came from, how long it was) </li><li>  Ability to transfer conversations between operators </li><li>  Operator status (online / offline) </li><li>  Saving history (available only from one device) </li></ul><br>  These commandments (criteria) of communication with customers were guided when selecting chat rooms several years ago, but that has changed.  The market needs new solutions to help guide the user through all stages of the sales funnel.  Build effective models of interaction for each stage. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/f8e/690/4cc/f8e6904cc5db67d275eeeb950e4450d4.png" alt="image005" width="748" height="439"></a> <br><br>  Chats in the classical sense no longer work and are receding into the past.  Many companies use this and publish relevant content, offering their own, supposedly correct solutions. <br><br>  Service-callers say - the best option is calls.  Email services - it's better to generate leads and heat them by mail, etc.  All this is far from objectivity and misinforming readers.  In essence, they are being urged to abandon the productive communication channel. <br><br>  We, supporters of a systematic approach, decided to consider the problem from all angles.  Below are our solutions that are needed today for effective interaction with visitors. <br><br><h3>  <b>2. "Ecosystem"</b> </h3><br>  We all know that our audience is completely different.  Even similar segments may <b>differ in a number of ways</b> .  For someone it is easier to call and agree on everything (incidentally, the case is infrequent), for someone to look for information on the website, blog.  Many used to write in the chat.  Employed constantly "run away from you", it is more convenient for them to continue communication by mail. <br><br>  So why not give <b>customers the</b> opportunity <b>to decide</b> what is more convenient for them? <br><br>  <a href="http://carrotquest.ru/chat%3Futm_source%3Dmegam%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_term%3Dsoldatov%26utm_content%3D2%26utm_campaign%3Dchat">Carrot Quest</a> allows you to use chat and email in one service.  This allows you to draw into the conversation the maximum number of your visitors and take them to the purchase.  We recently <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/carrotquest/blog/13960/">wrote about it</a> in detail <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/carrotquest/blog/13960/">.</a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/0e7/b7f/0c3/0e7b7f0c38ff19b76629246cfdfed335.png" alt="image007" width="692" height="321"></a> <br><br>  Use all methods of communication in one system and create a powerful synergy. <br><br>  The client is on your site - will write in the chat.  It is in a hurry or more convenient to communicate by mail - all correspondence is duplicated in the mail, there it can also answer. <br><br>  The most important thing is that the client will have access to the <b>history of correspondence on all devices and channels.</b>  Classic services do not know how.  They can show the history of correspondence, if only a visitor comes from the same device with which he was the 1st time. <br><br>  <a href="http://carrotquest.ru/chat%3Futm_source%3Dmegam%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_term%3Dsoldatov%26utm_content%3D2%26utm_campaign%3Dchat">With Carrot Quest</a> , the client can start communication from the computer, continue on the mobile, and complete via mail.  Or in any other order. <br><br>  <b>New commandments formulated in this paragraph:</b> <br><ol><li>  Unified channel management system (chat, mail, call) </li><li>  Advanced correspondence history, a visitor from different devices is recognized as the same person and can see the whole story. </li></ol><br><br><h3>  <b>3. "Mass personalization."</b> </h3><br>  Today, one of the main tools of internet marketing is personalization.  When we get to the maximum of the interests, motives and personal data of the user and we can individually refer to it, making our offer jewelery. <br><br>  The best assistant in this is <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/carrotquest/blog/237805/">event analytics</a> , which <a href="http://carrotquest.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegam%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_term%3Dsoldatov%26utm_content%3D2%26utm_campaign%3Dchat">Carrot Quest</a> provides.  The analysis is based on the actions performed by the user.  The entire history of the user's actions on the site is recorded in his individual card in the service. <br><br>  <a href="http://carrotquest.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegam%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_term%3Dsoldatov%26utm_content%3D2%26utm_campaign%3Dchat">Carrot Quest</a> allows you to isolate and segment customers <strong>by their actions</strong> : <br><ul><li>  viewed pages </li><li>  button clicks </li><li>  filled in input fields on the site (can fill in and not send) - left email-addresses, phone numbers, etc. </li><li>  by source </li><li>  by UTM tags </li><li>  on payments made by users </li><li>  by loyalty level </li><li>  and etc. </li></ul><br><br>  You see what actions the visitor has done, what exactly he needs.  If you take this into account when making proposals, your <b>help will be much more efficient</b> , and the conversion into a purchase will be higher. <br><br>  For example, your operator saw that the visitor entered in the search bar on the site, but this is enough to start a dialogue.  Clients are glad that they are understood at once.  When the offer is valid, the conversion is higher.  Imagine what you can do, knowing all the actions performed by the user. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/883/fb6/37f/883fb637f67fa34e92f23277acf7f684.png" alt="image009" width="811" height="582"></a> <br><br>  This model <b>can be effectively used at all stages of purchase (funnel)</b> .  For example, when working with a basket or user wish-lists, when a customer put an item in the basket, but did not complete the purchase.  Knowing his interests, you can contact by name and offer similar products and solutions.  Literally, help the user make a purchase. <br><br>  We have <a href="http://carrotquest.ru/blog/podskazki-po-obshheniyu-s-polzovatelyam-v-dialogax/%3Futm_source%3Dmegam%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_term%3Dsoldatov%26utm_content%3D2%26utm_campaign%3Dchat">detailed information</a> on how messages are sent. <br><br>  <b>New "commandments" of this item:</b> <br><ol><li>  Availability of data on all actions and user dialogues </li><li>  The possibility of segmentation according to different data </li></ol><br><br><h3>  <b>4. Automation of communication</b> </h3><br>  Manually you can‚Äôt do everything, especially if you have a huge number of visitors.  Actions can and should be automated in order to capture the user in time and concentrate his attention. <br><br>  <a href="http://carrotquest.ru/marketing%3Futm_source%3Dmegam%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_term%3Dsoldatov%26utm_content%3D2%26utm_campaign%3Dchat">Carrot Quest</a> allows you to automate the process of communication and set up trigger messages in chat, pop-up, mail.  Knowing the actions that the visitor took and at what stage of the purchase he is located, you can create a very fine-tuning. <br><br>  For example, your client added a book to the cart, but did not buy it.  On your next visit, in the chat you can show this product, which will be already at a discount.  Do you think it will increase the likelihood of purchase? <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/c27/f1a/182/c27f1a18215eea4d9368e74afea40003.png" alt="image011" width="742" height="502"></a> <br><br>  To know exactly, you need to collect all the statistics on automatic actions, test different options.  We all know this well, but for some reason not everyone else does it. <br><br>  <b>New commandments "from the paragraph:</b> <br><ol><li>  Setting up trigger messages for chat (for each stage of the funnel) </li><li>  Auto message reading statistics </li></ol><br><br><h3>  <b>5. Show the pop-up and continue chatting in it.</b> </h3><br>  <a href="http://carrotquest.ru/popup%3Futm_source%3Dmegam%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_term%3Dsoldatov%26utm_content%3D2%26utm_campaign%3Dchat">Carrot Quest</a> offers a very fine-tuning of pop-up windows, depending on the actions performed by the user and the stage of the purchase cycle. <br><br>  Imagine at the right moment a window appears with relevant information for your client.  No more annoying late windows. <br><br>  A window has appeared, your visitor has read the information and can now continue to communicate with the operator in <b>the same window</b> .  Without switching to other tabs.  <b>Chat is built into the POP-UP window.</b> <br><br>  For example, offer the customer a cool teapot that he was interested in the day before.  Show all the benefits of the acquisition.  Here he can ask to clarify all his points of interest: cost, delivery, operator's opinion about this kettle and much more. <br><br>  This is a great way to start chatting.  <strong>At this point, only one commandment:</strong> <br><ol><li>  Show a personal pop-up at the right time and continue chatting in it. </li></ol><br><br><h3>  <b>6. Operators and analytics.</b> </h3><br>  Operators must be fully staffed.  We need a whole system of motivation, operator evaluation, as well as an analysis of the effectiveness of the chat.  The above is an advantage, but there are <strong>still some chips</strong> : <br><ol><li>  Unlimited number of operators </li><li>  Mobile application for operators (time and place is not a problem) </li><li>  Analytics: how chat influenced sales and further actions of the user (both in total and for each operator) </li></ol><br>  As it turned out, neither the communication channel itself, but the old solutions died.  In our humble opinion, we presented 10 solutions that are key to building work with users in a chat. <br><br>  And what solutions do you see?  What criteria are key?  We will be interested to know your opinion. <br><br>  Reading articles is of course useful, but you better see and try for yourself.  By the way, our solutions are simply and clearly described on the <a href="http://carrotquest.ru/marketing%3Futm_source%3Dmegam%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_term%3Dsoldatov%26utm_content%3D2%26utm_campaign%3Dchat">site</a> .  Chat is only the top of our service. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/289562/">https://habr.com/ru/post/289562/</a></p>
