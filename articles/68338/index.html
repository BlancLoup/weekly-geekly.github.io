  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Airsoft: A little bit about everything</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Probably, many have already heard about such a game as airsoft (StrikeBall, AirSoft).  Especially in light of the latest events related to the release of the STALKER computer game, and the so-called Stalker Strikes conducted based on it.  So, for several topics I would like to talk a little about the history of airsoft, about its appearance in Russia, in the Urals, and, of course, about the Stalker Strike itself.  So, perhaps, we will begin a floor to an order. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  SHORT STORY </h4><br>  After the end of the Second World War, Japan, as a country of the vanquished, did not have the right to have its own armed forces and conduct military exercises with the use of real weapons.  In the late 80s, early 90s, the Japanese created complete copies of military weapons, the principle of which is based on pneumatic firing with plastic balls of 6 mm caliber.  Most of these weapons corresponded to their real prototypes both in size and in mass.  Moreover, the weapon is divided according to the principle of action into three categories: mechanical, gas-cylinder and electropneumatic. <br><br><h4>  STRIKEBALL AS HE IS </h4><br><img src="http://xmages.net/out.php/i460385_3.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Airsoft is a team game in which shooting is conducted from the weight and size analogues of a real weapon made of plastic or metal with plastic balls of 6 mm caliber. <br>  The game is an imitation of hostilities, as close as possible to reality.  The player is a real soldier, no more, no less, in full gear, except for weapons.  Games can take place perfectly in any setting: forest, mud, slush, rain or a city with dilapidated buildings, clean field, etc.  Usually, players form teams that travel together to field competitions, train, etc.  Some teams try to regain real-life combat units down to the smallest details: peak aces on helmets from the Vietnam War, etc. <br>  Naturally, in the games there are some rules.  Airsoft is no exception.  The set of rules can be read on any airsoft portal (I will cite the links at the end of the article).

    <h4>  EQUIPMENT </h4><br><img src="http://xmages.net/out.php/i460389_5.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The equipment of the player may be different, the benefit of the options is a wagon and a small truck.  Nobody forbids wearing body armor, helmets, night vision devices and other gadgets.  The main thing is that it does not interfere in the game itself.  This all looks, of course, impressive, but wearing is not always comfortable. <br>  If a player is in a team that is trying to regain certain troops, then he will have to find the appropriate equip for himself, for it will look rather ridiculous in the ranks of marines, a man in tarpaulin boots and a pea jacket, with AK74 at the ready.  So, a small but negative. <br><br>  But the most important elements of equipment are, first of all, goggles or "assault" mask, and of other elements of protection: elbow pads, knee pads, helmet, gloves.  Without them - nowhere.  I myself prefer to run light: a uniform, a balaclava, an ‚Äúassault‚Äù mask, a discharge vest, boots, elbow pieces.  Simple and tasteful. <br><br><h4>  ARMAMENT </h4><br>  All weapons in airsoft can be divided into 3 categories: mechanics, gas, electrical, except for grenades, various kinds of mortars and grenade launchers. <br><br><h6>  Mechanical weapon </h6><br><img src="http://xmages.net/out.php/t460411_6.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The most numerous category.  Includes a huge number of models of pistols, submachine guns and assault rifles.  The shot is made by descending from a platoon of a spring-loaded piston moving inside the pneumatic chamber.  Before each shot, the piston needs to be cocked with muscular strength by the shooter, distorting the shutter, or pushing the loading handle back (for automatic models).  The main material of the case is impact-resistant plastic.  Pneumatic chamber, piston, trigger mechanism - high-pressure polyethylene.  Brass barrel, polished bore.  The sighting range is 10 - 15 m for pistols and 20 -25 m for machine guns.  Rate of fire - 1 aimed shot per second. <br><br>  I think everyone once played or saw Chinese pistols and machine guns.  That is about it. <br><br><h6>  Gas balloon </h6><br><img src="http://xmages.net/out.php/i460414_7.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Copies are usually copied, which are driven by the energy of compressed gas pumped through the valve into the handle.  The principle of operation is similar to the work of a gas balloon for 4.5 mm steel balls.  When the slide frame is retracted, the feeder departs with it, and during the return stroke it sends the next ball to the chamber and holds it there, reliably locking the bore with a rubber gasket.  The rear section of the shutter cocks and the sear is held in this position.  When pulling the trigger, he briskly hits the valve of the gas-filled dosing unit, energetically opening it for a short time.  Expanding, the gas pushes the ball out of the chamber, which is twisted upward, thanks to a special rubber gasket of a special form, located at the beginning of the barrel channel.  This ball spinning system, which, by the way, is also equipped with some models of the ‚Äúmechanical‚Äù series, has received the untranslatable name ‚ÄúHop-up‚Äù.  It allows the ball to achieve a more stable path, while increasing the sighting range, which is already more than 20 meters.  Also, the shooting of gas weapons can occur and self-platoon, which significantly increases the rate of fire, however, at the expense of accuracy. <br><br><h6>  Electromechanical weapons </h6><br><img src="http://xmages.net/out.php/t460417_8.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The most interesting type of 6 mm airsoft weapon is the model of submachine guns and machine guns with electric drive to an air compressor.  This device allows you to conduct automatic fire at a speed of about 700 - 800 rounds per minute for a maximum distance of about 80 meters.  All machines in this category are equipped with an adjustable ‚ÄúHop-up‚Äù system, i.e.  according to their wishes, the shooter can change the force of the ball twisting, reaching the greatest range at the highest accuracy.  According to the performance of the ‚Äúelectric drive‚Äù, they were made much more interesting than the previous categories due to the maximum equipment with metal parts.  These machines are driven by high-precision electric motors with a voltage of 8.4V, powered by nickel-cadmium batteries with a capacity of 600 or 1300 milliamperes / hour.  One battery charge of 1300 ma / h is enough for about 3500 - 4000 shots, 600 ma / h is three times less. <br><br><h4>  ADVANTAGES OF STRIKEBALL IN COMPARISON WITH OTHER MILITARY GAMES </h4><br>  1. The reality of the weapon (meaning the almost complete conformity of airsoft weapons with real weapons). <br>  2. Minor traumatic impact on the player.  Unlike paintball, where the player must be protected by cumbersome armor that reduces mobility, vision and hearing, the player in airsoft can be limited to eye protectors, whether it be light plastic glasses or a mosquito net. <br>  3. Unlimited area for the game, which can be any forest, field, playgrounds or city conditions (buildings, construction sites). <br>  4. The relative cheapness and ease of ammunition (compared to paintball). <br>  5. The principle of operation of models allows to fire from any position of the weapon. <br>  6. Minimum impact on airsoft weapons of climatic conditions. <br><br><h4>  LINKS TO MATERIALS </h4><br>  1. Airsoft.  <a href="http://www.airsoftgun.ru/">www.airsoftgun.ru</a> <br>  2.

If the reader is interested, then I will definitely write =) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/68338/">https://habr.com/ru/post/68338/</a></p>
