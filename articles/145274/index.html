Five thousand of her colleagues had to deal with the zoo applications and software, which were beyond the control of IT services. <br><br>  First, the company made a guide on the applications that can be used and which should be avoided.  To reduce the temptation to use unsafe services (for example, file sharing services), IBM developed and began to train employees to their own counterparts.  For the most part, employees understood security requirements.  And the most annoying of them was the eight-digit alphanumeric password for unlocking devices. <br><br>  Today, about 120,000 users access the IBM network from mobile devices.  80,000 of them independently service and pay for communication, the remaining 40,000 use corporate smartphones.  The most popular gadgets are Google Android, Apple iPhone and iPad and Blackberry.  It should also be clarified that not all devices and platforms were allowed to work, as they did not meet the security requirements.  The company also made a guide on popular devices and their properties to help select the most appropriate models. <br><br>  The components of the BYOD program include the <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/lotus/products/notes/traveler.html">Lotus Notes Traveler</a> mobile application, which allows you to use corporate mail and a calendar.  As well as the <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/ru/tivoli/solutions/endpoint/">Tivoli Endpoint Manager</a> platform, for remote management of client equipment (as the name implies) and its monitoring in real time. <br><br>  IBM may erase information from the phone if it is lost, or if the employee leaves.  Therefore, when it became possible to delete only corporate data (for example, mail), without touching personal - the employees were extremely happy. <br><br>  <a href="http://fm.sap.com/byod/"><b>SAP</b></a> <br>  According to the company itself, SAP has become one of the pioneers in the use of tablets in its business - both developers and sales managers. <br><br>  Today, SAP uses 40,000 mobile devices worldwide, 18,000 of which are tablets.  Whether it is a corporate or personal device used in the work of SAP employees - it is under the complete control of the company's IT service.  Access to corporate information, including mail and mobile applications, can be blocked at any time.  For the safe management of user devices, the company uses the <a href="http://www.sybase.ru/products/mobileenterprise/afaria/components">Afaria</a> solution ‚Äî it backs up, updates, encrypts, remotely deletes data, and also optimizes it during transmission (which is important with a small bandwidth). <br><br>  <a href="http://www.cio.com/article/706274/VMware_Going_All_In_with_BYOD"><b>VMware</b></a> <br>  6000 employees were given 90 days to migrate from corporate devices to their own.  Such a bold and aggressive at first glance step is actually the result of a compromise.  On the one hand, the employees themselves complained about the obsolescence and / or limited choice of corporate technology.  On the other hand, the finance department was not satisfied with VMware's excessive IT costs.  According to Mark Egan's CIO, the option between corporate standards and personal equipment is a nightmare for the IT department.  Therefore, the VMware policy has become mandatory. <br><br>  Employees were faced with a choice: to keep the corporate mobile device, completely taking over his service, including  communication costs, or purchase a gadget that supports <a href="http://blackberrynet.ru/entser.php">BlackBerry Enterprise Server</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActiveSync">ActiveSync</a> .  In the future, VMware compensated spending on mobile communications in the range of $ 70 or $ 250 per month, depending on the position held.  Mark Egan himself noted that as a result of all these changes, he himself began to spend less by 30%. <br><br>  Not surprisingly, the transition was painful - at first it took to extinguish the ‚Äúpeople's anger‚Äù about wasting its own resources on what was previously in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility of the company.  By the way, corporate social network provided tangible assistance.  Employees and ‚Äústeam let out‚Äù, and were able to help each other with the same choice of tariff plans.  And IT did not have to answer typical questions again and again. <br><br>  In the next quarter, VMware plans to begin migrating to personal laptops.  Here the company will resort to using its own products for application virtualization, cloud storage, and the corporate App Store. <br><br>  <a href="http://security.networksasia.net/content/mastercard-tackles-byod-strict-conditions%3Fpage%3D0%252C0"><b>Mastercard</b></a> <br>  The MasterCard BYOD program started just over a year ago, and already 2,000 of the 6,700 employees took part in it.  Today, the program is designed for use by employees iPhone, iPad, as well as devices based on Android.  All stored and transmitted data is encrypted, and to log into the corporate network you need to pass authorization each time. <br>  In case of loss of the gadget, only corporate information is blocked and removed from the device - taking care of personal data is under the responsibility of the user. <br><br>  <a href="http://communities.intel.com/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadBody/19164-102-1-22410/Best_Practices_for_Enabling_Employee-owned_Smart_Phones_in_the_Enterprise_Public_version.pdf"><b>Intel</b></a> <br>  In the middle of 2011, two years after the start of the BYOD program, already 58% of Intel employees (30,000 people) used personal smartphones for business purposes. <br><br><div class="slideshow"><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/11977633&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiNK-u32FKNa_Jy53US9Ejt0yK_IA" width="425" height="355" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><br>  The implementation of BYOD in Intel went through several stages: <br><ul><li>  stakeholder discussion of the initiative - HR, legal department, engineers; </li><li>  open discussion among employees (covered over 8,000 people); </li><li>  developing security measures ‚Äî how to best protect corporate data by spending an adequate amount of resources; </li><li>  selection of supported platforms - the company has focused on 5 popular OS; </li><li>  formalization of the policy regarding BYOD and its reporting to employees; </li><li>  creation of an easy-to-use web portal within the service infrastructure for applications and consultations of employees </li><li>  the actual implementation of the program and the subsequent retention of a ‚Äúhand on the pulse‚Äù as new operating systems are updated and released - all software passes the certification procedure and receives a verdict on the possibility of its use. </li></ul><br>  The procedure of switching to your own device involves an online request to the IT service and receiving confirmation of the possibility of using the gadget and accepting the conditions and restrictions, after which the device configuration instructions are sent to the employee.  To determine which corporate data can be accessed from a personal mobile for a particular employee, the company has created an algorithm that takes into account five access levels, security tools provided by the phone itself, and ‚Äúprofiles of detractors‚Äù. <br><br>  Prior to the implementation of the program, 80% of Intel‚Äôs costs of maintaining mobile access were spent on paying monthly bills for communication services.  Within the framework of the BYOD program, the company transferred to the zone of responsibility of employees the choice of both the device and the tariff plan, which allowed optimizing the company's expenses.  Evolutionarily, Intel has come to 3 financing schemes - in 55% of cases an employee pays for everything, 35% - a company, 10% uses a hybrid scheme - an employee buys a smartphone from his own pocket, and the company makes monthly payments. <br><br>  According to employee reviews, Intel calculated that the ability to continuously communicate with colleagues and clients from home, or while on the road, on average saves each employee 47 minutes a day, which is 1.7 million hours per quarter per company.  At the same time, the company believes that corporate security has even improved - thanks to the control over what has happened before, but was not monitored.  This year, the company plans to allow laptops for work purposes. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/hardware/data_centers/224800069%3Fcid%3DRSSfeed_IWK_All"><b>Citrix systems</b></a> <br>  In 2008, Citrix Systems launched a three-year BYOD program, announcing its readiness to compensate $ 2,100 for employees to purchase computers that are convenient for them.  To pay extra from your own pocket for models more expensive was not forbidden, than many used, adding up to half the amount.  As a result of the first 18 months from the launch of the campaign, 1,400 people joined it. <br><br>  The head of the system engineers at the Moscow office of the company, Sergei Halyapin, in a recent interview with Open Systems <a href="http://www.osp.ru/os/2012/03/13015157/">added</a> that even if the employee already has a computer, the money allocated can be spent on anything. <br><br>  Solutions are based on proprietary technologies and services, including, for example, XenDesktop virtual desktops and XenClient client hypervisors.  Remote access to corporate resources is provided through the Citrix Receiver application.  Having received a blank check for working with any devices and operating systems, sales managers also had the opportunity to demonstrate the functionality of the products "without departing from the cash register." <br><br>  To ensure security in the company, a few simple rules apply: <br><ul><li>  use your own file-sharing counterparts - acquired by ShareFile and Podio. </li><li>  store data on the server or use file sharing tools </li><li>  connect to corporate resources through Citrix Access Gateway or Citrix NetScale ‚Äî after checking the credentials, the user may be limited in functionality. </li></ul><br>  The campaign‚Äôs financial goal was to reduce the cost of purchasing and maintaining user devices by 20%.  Judging by the information in various interviews - the goal is achieved.  The company‚Äôs savings amounted to about $ 500 per piece in three years, including scholarships. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.itpro.co.uk/640366/business-of-it-building-a-case-for-byod"><b>Colt</b></a> <br>  In the British telecom company Colt, the BYOD program ‚ÄúChoice‚Äù was tested on 200 employees, after which the possibility of abandoning corporate technology in favor of personal technology became available to the rest.  At first, 10% of the 5500 employees took advantage of the offer, but already today the option of using any devices for work purposes via a virtual desktop has already been tried out by 1,800 people. <br><br>  Colt does not subsidize the acquisition of computers for personal use, but as part of the migration program from corporate laptops, employees are paid 1,000 euros for three years to support and maintain personal computers.  Thus, the company managed to save money on the redistribution of the budget between the update of the operating system from corporate computers and the support of virtualization and the Choice program. <br><br>  <b>Well, our humble experience</b> <br>  The concept of BYOD does not even have a formal status, but has gradually become the norm in Gars Telecom. <br><br>  Laptops: <br><ul><li>  If an employee needs a new laptop, he writes his requirements and wishes to the IT department (for capacity, monitor diagonal, aesthetic requests, etc.) Within a certain budget (depending on employee status), the company selects several models to choose from.  There is also a co-financing scheme in which part of the cost of a laptop is reimbursed by the company. </li><li>  Gradually, some employees switched to Apple products, and the IT department had to integrate the devices into the corporate network. </li></ul><br>  Phones: <br><ul><li>  Since in our country there is no binding of the phone to the operator, the company easily assumes payment for the corporate communications of employees within the established limits (from 1000 rubles per month), depending on the nature of the work and the position of the employee. </li><li>  Back in 2006, they began to provide all technical specialists working at the exits with corporate smartphones based on Windows Mobile (with the function of remote content management). </li></ul><br>  <b>Summary</b> <br>  BYOD is an obvious trend, closing your eyes on that is unwise.  The key economic effect is still not in the mobile devices themselves, but in the ability of employees to work remotely, regardless of place and time.  And the main factor of a successful project is the ability of an organization to listen and hear its own employees. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/145274/">https://habr.com/ru/post/145274/</a></p>
