It turns out that we can learn all this from classic films. <br>  At <a title="Carbucks.com helps save money on buying a new car on credit" href="http://carbucks.ru/">Carbucks.com</a> we love movies.  The pictures are taken to entertain, at least - to inform, and sometimes they even teach us.  They can inspire or re-inspire faith in humanity, and sometimes films are directly tied to what influences many aspects in our life - on money.  Sometimes a movie is made that gives an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe real management of money and finances and gives worthwhile business advice (of course, as an addition to the main storyline).  I suggest you learn a lot of useful information from the 10 films listed below, which will tell you everything about money, even if it is not obvious at first glance. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br> <strong><img width="120" height="174" align="left" src="http://blog.carbucks.ru/files/Image/Wall_Street_film.jpg"></strong> <br>  <strong>1. Wall Street (1987)</strong> <br>  <em>The fact is, lady and gentlemen, that greed cannot be said otherwise, that is good.</em>  <em>Greed is right, greed is working.</em>  <em>Greed clarifies, sheds light and reflects the essence of the spirit of evolution.</em>  <em>Greed, in all its forms - greed for life, money, love, knowledge - helps mankind to improve, to go further.</em>  <em>And greed, mind you, will not only save Teldar Paper, but also another poorly functioning corporation, which is called the ‚ÄúUSA‚Äù.</em>  <em>Thanks to all!</em> <br>  <em>Gordon Gekko.</em> <br>  The film, which brought Oscar to Michael Douglas, is not just memorable, it is the quintessence of films about business in the era of the 80s.  Gordon Gekko‚Äôs famous monologue illustrates the atmosphere of greed and abuse of power in corporations of the time.  The name Gekko has become an international icon, a synonym for uncontrollable greed.  In addition, many say that the current economic situation is the result of actions taken by such here Gekko and their comrades. <br><br><img width="120" height="174" align="left" src="http://blog.carbucks.ru/files/Image/ShawshankRedemptionMoviePoster.jpg"><br>  <strong>2. Escape from the Shawshank (1994)</strong> <br>  <em>It all comes down to one thing: do life or death!</em> <br>  <em>Andy difrain</em> <br>  This critically acclaimed film about a mistakenly convicted New England banker is one of the most powerful in terms of fullness of important messages.  Dyfrein (Tim Robbins), in the end, escapes from prison thanks to a meticulous, choreographically verified escape plan and his own perseverance.  His dedication reminds us of the need for effective long-term planning for a successful financial future.  This is a movie about hoping for the best, but not forgetting the worst.  One must learn to accept everything ‚Äî good and bad ‚Äî and learn to adapt. <br><br><img width="120" height="178" align="left" src="http://blog.carbucks.ru/files/Image/Godfather_ver1.jpg"><br>  <strong>3. The Godfather (1972)</strong> <br>  <em>I will make him an offer he cannot refuse.</em> <br>  <em>Vito Corleone</em> <br>  It is considered that the Godfather film trilogy is a model of cinema art, and the above quote cannot be more than appropriate in our rating.  The film teaches you to make bold decisions, as well as to know the price of things that you will have to pay for someday.  And in general, frankly, money sometimes speaks for us.

    <br><br><img width="120" height="178" align="left" src="http://blog.carbucks.ru/files/Image/Jerry_Maguire_movie_poster.jpg"><br>  <strong>4. Jerry Maguire (1996)</strong> <br>  <em>Show me the money!</em> <br>  <em>Rod Tidwell</em> <br>  In this film, a successful sports agent Maguire learns to value people above money.  His highs and lows on the road to enlightenment teach him to respect himself and others, to appreciate proper business ethics.  A little out of our rating film with the basic idea that in life there is something more than money.  In addition, in the course of the film to the hero comes the realization of actions only with an understanding of their capabilities. <br><br><br><img width="117" height="175" align="left" src="http://blog.carbucks.ru/files/Image/Field_of_Dreams.jpg"><br>  <strong>5. The Field of Miracles (1989)</strong> <br>  <em>If you build it, it will come ...</em> <br>  <em>"Schuless" by Joe Jackson</em> <br>  For you businessmen: if you have a good idea that you believe in, follow the intended path!  Everyone weighs the risks and possible profits, but for the realization of big plans, you always have to go for big risks. <br><br><br><br><br><img width="120" height="179" align="left" src="http://blog.carbucks.ru/files/Image/BoilerRoom.jpg"><br>  <strong>6. Boiler room (2000)</strong> <br>  <em>Such garbage: a call without a sale does not happen.</em>  <em>With every call you sell.</em>  <em>It does not matter if you sold a product to a customer or he sold you a reason for not buying it.</em>  <em>In any case, the sale is made, the only question remains, which one of you won?</em>  <em>You or him</em>  <em>No need to think long, of course, me!</em> <br>  <em>Jim young</em> <br>  There are winners and losers in business.  Usually the victory of one is a big problem for others.  Even in spite of the fact that not everyone works in sales, new opportunities regularly knock on our doors.  And the one who takes the initiative is usually successful.  This rule applies equally well to personal finance and entertainment, and even, do not believe it, to working days. <br><br><img width="120" height="177" align="left" src="http://blog.carbucks.ru/files/Image/Biglebowskiposter.jpg"><br>  <strong>7. The Big Lebowski (1998)</strong> <br>  <em>Need a finger?</em>  <em>I can get it.</em>  <em>Believe me, there are ways!</em>  <em>You better not know.</em> <br>  <em>Walter Sobchak</em> <br>  The cult film about how absurd sometimes the actions of people in pursuit of money: what they do, how they behave and what they say.  Starting with those who have the keys to any cities to the unemployed bowling fans, the film‚Äôs heroes show us how important it is to be a creative person in order to achieve what you want.  The search for alternative solutions to problems is especially important in the current economic situation. <br><br><br><img width="120" height="185" align="left" src="http://blog.carbucks.ru/files/Image/Glengarrymovie.jpg"><br>  <strong>8. Americans (1992)</strong> <br>  <em>VP</em>  <em>B - always, P - sell.</em>  <em>Always sell, always sell.</em> <br>  <em>Blake.</em> <br>  This quote by Blake (Alec Baldwin) about the importance of steady sales ‚Äî hard and merciless sales ‚Äî in a collapsing economy.  His hero is invited to a group of businessmen with a dubious reputation in order to set their brains right.  His speech in the film is intended to inspire merchants to set the bar higher.  The point is that no one can achieve greater success without a high level of trust.  Therefore, sometimes you need to take radical measures, especially in order to get together and get out of a difficult financial situation. <br><br><img width="120" height="188" align="left" src="http://blog.carbucks.ru/files/Image/How_to_succeed_movie_poster.jpg"><br>  <strong>9. How to succeed in business without doing anything (1967)</strong> <br>  <em>If you have education, intelligence, and ability, much better.</em>  <em>But remember that thousands have already reached the top, not possessing any of these qualities.</em> <br>  <em>J. B. Wiggli.</em> <br>  The young man begins his career as a window washer and gradually rises to the top.  The quote from the film teaches us that there is always more than one opportunity to achieve success.  For those who can work hard, focus and creativity are key. <br><br><br><img width="120" height="185" align="left" src="http://blog.carbucks.ru/files/Image/Trading_Places.jpg"><br>  <strong>10. Swap places (1983)</strong> <br>  <em>Think about the main thing, think positively.</em>  <em>Never show weakness.</em>  <em>Always step on your throat.</em>  <em>Buy cheap, sell expensive.</em>  <em>Fear ... this is the problem of other guys.</em> <br>  <em>Louis Winthrop III</em> <br>  The classic comedy of the early 1980s about an influential businessman turned into a criminal, while a street thug turns into a law-abiding businessman.  Good start, right?  It is interesting to observe how two completely different personalities overcome the vicissitudes of fate (see Escape from the Shoushenk).  The following important lesson can be learned from this film: without thinking about the welfare of others, be on the lookout and always think first about your financial affairs.  The latter is especially true in today's situation! <br><br>  I hope that these films will not only deliver a lot of pleasant moments to haberdogs, but also give useful financial advice.  By the way, our project <a title="carbucks.ru - the easiest way to choose a car loan" href="http://carbucks.ru/">carbucks.ru is starting</a> soon, which we will definitely tell the habrasoobschestvu. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/67059/">https://habr.com/ru/post/67059/</a></p>
