  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Targeting advertising budget in Ya.Direct</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Advertising budget is a tricky business.  That he is, then it is no longer there.  And this can happen, not because your ad, in Yandex search, worked really well and many interested clients passed on it, but also because your competitors decided to spend some of their money so that you could lose yours. <br><br>  Is it legal?  Is it possible to?  Yes, but first things first. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>At the end of the article I will tell you why you should not engage in such activities and what this may entail for you.</b> <br><br><h2>  When you realize that the advertising budget has merged and gave a zero result </h2><br>  Recently, I began to notice that more and more robots began to move onto the site for advertising.  They sit on a page for 2 to 5 seconds, it happens that even 10. Refusals increase, money per click is written off, viewing depth decreases, behavioral drops.

        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      <br>
      I used to think that it was just a coincidence, nobody purposefully deals with this, who generally needs to bother.  But how was I was wrong. <br><br>  At one fine moment, the manager of the company, which deals with skipping the advertising budget in Ya.Direct, called me.  Moreover, according to them, for this purpose they developed a special robot that fully emulates user behavior and is not recognized by Yandex as a bot.  It scans the search, follows different links, but the main task is to follow exactly the first three links of the advertisement, under the search bar.  And if you are a client of this company, then the address of your site is entered in the white list and no one will follow your links. <br><br>  At first I decided that this is another razvodily.  Give us the money, we will remove the competitors and other noodles.  He began to be interested in this company on the forums and directly at Yandek himself. <br><br>  On the forums, of course there was a mass of incomprehensible reviews and comments.  Angry, laudatory and other, nothing worth attention.  But the answer to Yandex puzzled me. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/by/p8/ma/byp8mauvy9wy-d-hppwosbrtpmo.jpeg"><br><br>  It turns out, Yandex is well aware of these guys.  But nothing else, "We try, money is not written off for bots, let them exist for themselves," they do not want to undertake.  Yes, the price tag for these guys is quite substantial, on average, 45-50 thousand prepayment.  But then there are a lot of people who are willing to spend such a sum.  In some niches of business, such an amount is spent on advertising for a couple of weeks or even days. <br><br>  After a little more search in the forums, I found some interesting reviews and comments, sort of like an employee of Yandex. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ho/oi/d3/hooid3rp5gqzaknt9crdeoavj1c.jpeg"><br><br>  As it turned out the problem is relevant since 2015.  But it seems Yandex didn‚Äôt do anything significant.  The company exists to this day, and it seems successful. <br><br>  As for ordinary users, whose budgets may suffer.  Agree to the services of these guys or not, your business.  But you need to remember one truth: <br><br>  <b>Even if you have paid for competitor clicks, he can also pay for clicks on your ad.</b>  <b>No whitelists can help.</b>  <b>After all, if in the end everyone will cooperate, then whom should they link then?</b> <br><br><h2>  And how to deal with such sklikami? </h2><br>  It is necessary to immediately understand the important point: <br>  Nothing, 100% will not save you from fraud clicks, draining budgets and other things. <br><br><ol><li>  <b>The first thing that occurred to me was Webmaster Ya.Metriki</b> <br>  It‚Äôs not so difficult to track transitions and analyze behavior yourself, but it is time consuming, plus to this, you need to somehow prove to Yandex that it really was a bot, and not you want to return your budget yourself. </li><li>  You can analyze logs of visits, but this is for those who know at least a little of it.  Some even do not have access to the logs.  Not to mention to be able to analyze any visits there.  Again, try to prove that this is real data, not your cunning move. </li><li>  Do not order services from similar companies.  After all, to get into the so-called white list.  You must provide the addresses of sites to which the robot should not navigate.  And how to know that this white list tomorrow will not turn black. </li></ol><br><h2>  Still decided to order a competitor? </h2><br>  Then consider the following: <br><br><ul><li>  If the transitions are really carried out and are defined as real people, not bots, then you merge the budget to the competitor, there is no doubt.  But did you consider that the CTR of a competitor can grow in proportion to the number of clicks? </li><li>  As we know, the higher the CTR, the cheaper the clicks in the future.  You can spend your money trying to knock out a competitor's ad, drain its budget.  At first, you may even succeed, but when his CPC starts to fall, and your costs for bots grow, because you have to click more, then you will realize that you have spent both budget and time in vain. </li><li>  The amount spent on sklikivaniya, you could throw in your advertising campaign and get good customers.  But alas, you donated the money to someone, it is not clear why, and the competitor also began to spend less on advertising. </li><li>  Your data may have been saved in the system you used.  And it is possible that as soon as you stop paying, you will be asked to continue.  And perhaps, when you refuse, you yourself will become a victim of a click, but the bots will take you free and carry you out of the white to the black list. </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/344422/">https://habr.com/ru/post/344422/</a></p>
