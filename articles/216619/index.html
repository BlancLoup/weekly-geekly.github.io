  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Volvo makes sure you don't fall asleep</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Last Monday, the world-famous concern Volvo announced the development of a sensor system for the driver, which can determine if the driver is distracted too much from the road, or begins to fall asleep.  The idea is to create a security system that can take action in time and bring the car with the driver and passengers out of an emergency. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e43/dd9/ae2/e43dd9ae270913ad24cf8e73aa9bf21c.jpg" alt="image" width="350"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The system will be installed on the front dashboard of the car.  If the driver behaves inattentively on the road or begins to fall asleep, she (the system), taking data from the position and movement of the driver's eyes, will take measures, namely, whether the car is in front too close, or whether the car does not turn away from the road. <br><br>  <b>Peer Landworth,</b> Volvo Cars engineer and driver support project manager, said: <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúThis will allow the driver to be able to rely a little more on his car, and to know that he (the car) will help if necessary.‚Äù </blockquote>

      Volvo calls its system <b>Driver State Estimation</b> .  The core of the system is a sensor on the dashboard that monitors several things at the same time: <br><ol><li>  In which direction the driver looks; </li><li>  How open your eyes are; </li><li>  What is the position and angle of the head. </li></ol><br>  The small LEDs, which are controlled by the sensor, light up with infrared light.  They are invisible to the driver, since infrared light is beyond the wavelengths that are perceived by the human eye. <br><br>  This technology is part of the high-tech push of Volvo associated with safe traffic.  According to Volvo, Driver State Estimation, as well as analyzing the state of the driver, in which the sensors play an important role, is "The sowing field, which can become a support for independent driving in the future." <br><br>  The technology is already installed on test vehicles;  Volvo Cars is involved in data research with Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden and Volvo AB.  The results of the research will be methods that will be effective for detecting driver fatigue and detecting inattention. <br><br>  "The car must independently determine whether the driver is able to take control of the control, or not," says the company.  "It is the sensor that can assist in this." <br><br>  The technology is part of the Volvo Cars line of initiatives that are being made to achieve the main goal by 2020: ‚ÄúNo one should be killed or seriously injured in the new Volvo.‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c54/b59/0e0/c54b590e07fc960eb963e02c1d488318.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, not only falling asleep at the wheel is very dangerous, but drowsiness also has high risks.  With drowsiness, the driver becomes less attentive, the reaction time slows down, and decision-making ability suffers. <br><br>  All the popular methods of not falling asleep at the wheel (listening to music, opening the window, eating) are not really effective enough and have a great risk that the driver will fall asleep anyway.  This system will allow you to fully control the process of control when you fall asleep driver and will be able to prevent emergency and dangerous situations on the road. <br><br><h6>  Information taken from the official website of Volvo - <a href="https://www.media.volvocars.com/global/en-gb/media/pressreleases/140898/volvo-cars-conducts-research-into-driver-sensors-in-order-to-create-cars-that-get-to-know-their-driv">volvocars.com</a> and also from the information portal <a href="http://phys.org/news/2014-03-volvo-car-tech-sleepy.html">phys.org</a> <br>  Prepared by <a href="http://telebreeze.ru/">Telebreeze Team</a> <br></h6></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/216619/">https://habr.com/ru/post/216619/</a></p>
