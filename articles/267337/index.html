      The first news that in the upcoming version of iOS in the Safari browser will be able to block ads, has caused a serious stir.  Thematic editions predicted a quick demise of browser advertising and advertisers existing only at its expense.  The looming threat is even dubbed as Ad-mageddon (end of advertising).  There was an Apple presentation on which the topic was not much touched, an update was released, and the passion subsided a bit.  Let us try to figure out how ad blocking will actually work and to whom and by what it threatens. <br><br>  It is about the possibility of blocking ads in the browser, this does not apply to applications.  The blocker is a separate application that provides the browser with a list of rules for blocking elements of the loaded page.  The list is maintained and updated by the developer.  Extracting advertising content from the data significantly increases the download speed and reduces the power consumption of the device.  You can see in <a href="http://murphyapps.co/blog/2015/8/22/crystal-benchmarks">this article</a> how much loading is accelerated. <br><br>  Forecasts suggest that blocking will grow in popularity, which means that the revenues of services and sites that exist due to advertising will fall.  For them, such a scenario is offered, how to create your own application and fill it with advertising.  Nobody has forbidden it yet.  But how to be small services that are not able to master their own application, it is not clear.  For them, innovation and hit. <br><br>  Apparently, the real ‚ÄúAdmageddon‚Äù will come not soon.  The fact is that blockers are distributed for money, and the instruction on their activation is not so trivial for the average iPhone user.  Therefore, one should not expect that mobile ad blocking will become much more popular than its desktop counterpart (it is installed by no more than 5% of users, according to December data), at least in the near future. <br><br><br><h3>  <b>Google presentation set for September 29</b> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/473/754/e4d/473754e4d3ef46388bc12386b4fc6d56.jpg"><br><br>  Apple has reported on new products, but we are <a href="http://www.greenbot.com/article/2984828/android/google-plans-a-press-event-for-september-29th-hints-at-android-marshmallow-release.html">waiting for the</a> announcement of innovations from Google <a href="http://www.greenbot.com/article/2984828/android/google-plans-a-press-event-for-september-29th-hints-at-android-marshmallow-release.html">on September 29</a> . <br><br>  First of all, the company is waiting for the presentation of two new Nexus smartphones: one from Huawei and the other from LG.  Presumably, they will be called Huawei Nexus 6P and LG Nexus 5X.  Among the new hardware at the presentation, the company promised to show the second generation of the Chromecast media player. <br><br>  Immediately after the presentation is expected to release a new Android OS 6.0 Marshmallow. <br><br>  Unlike Apple, for Google the presentation is not a very familiar way to show a new product.  Apparently this time we will have something more interesting than what is stated in the announcement. <br><br><br><h3>  <b>7 deadly sins game designer</b> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/693/e8e/a47/693e8ea471334c9cb9ba851d15276fa5.jpg"><br><br>  An interesting interpretation of the seven sins in relation to game design was suggested by Konstantin Sakhnov, head of mobile projects at Mail.Ru Group.  It is a bit ironic, but overall very informative.  Undoubtedly, <a href="https://vc.ru/p/7-games-sin">it is worth reading to</a> all those interested in game development, and not just game designers.  Written very lucidly, I personally learned a couple of sins, I will go to fight with them. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/267337/">https://habr.com/ru/post/267337/</a></p>
