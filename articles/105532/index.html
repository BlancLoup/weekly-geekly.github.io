  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Start-up</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Ekaterina Lazhintseva has been involved in the Russification of Microsoft products since the days of Windows for Workgroups.  For some time, she published in her LJ interesting cases from past localizations, including the history of the <a href="http://katyal.livejournal.com/4116.html">memorable "application" in IE 4.0</a> . <br><blockquote>  And it is partly from inexperience, partly in the heat of the young enthusiasm, translated in a very unusual way.  We still returned a lot of things to a more familiar look, but the ‚Äúapplication launched‚Äù was noticed too late when the line had already left Ireland for Redmond to be included in the Java machine, and we were no longer able to fix it.  (from other interesting translations: Access denied "Denied claims.") </blockquote><br>  In the JVM settings, unusual translations are still found: <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bd4/181/a6d/bd4181a6d281bd80e11ff6ae7ab5efdd.png" alt="show warning pennants"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <a href="http://katyal.livejournal.com/533.html">Another blooper</a> - on the ‚ÄúWindows for Workgroups‚Äù box in several places, missed the word <i>groups</i> .  (I suspect that the phrase was not included in the length of the layout, and because of this, the last word was cut off when typing.) <br>  The resulting localization would be suitable for the country of victorious socialism: <i>Windows for workers</i> .  At the last moment, however, the words disappeared were noticed and corrected. <br><br>  Small typos, it happens, go unnoticed, despite all the readings.  Funny typos rarely come out, but, for example, in some of the versions of DirectX, instead of the <i>Video settings, we</i> <a href="http://katyal.livejournal.com/16733.html">have</a> <i>Video</i> <i>settings</i> . <br><br>  At first they wanted to call the <i>Start</i> button <i>Start</i> - the word was initially simple and clear, why invent something more sophisticated?  But just at the crucial moment Catherine was not at work, and behind her back the button was <a href="http://katyal.livejournal.com/17002.html">renamed</a> , giving a ‚Äúmore Russian‚Äù name. <br>  Basically, when it is possible, Russian names try to choose a consonant original (for example, the <i>profile</i> for the <i>profile</i> and the <i>domain</i> for the <i>domain</i> ), even when this consonant word seems meaningless in the new context.  A rarely chosen non-literal translation, expressing a general meaning, as a <i>shortcut label</i> .  Often, such a translation is too clumsy to gain a foothold in lively speech: remember the <i>browser</i> instead of the <i>browser</i> , the <i>account</i> instead of the <i>account</i> , or <i>the web site is found</i> instead of the <i>website found</i> . <br>  <i>Prikladyenitsa</i> was, of course, the exception - not tracing paper and not clericalism, but a living new word;  therefore, it clearly did not fit into Microsoft‚Äôs ‚Äúlanguage policy‚Äù.

      Interesting fate and the word <i>blog</i> .  Slovenian localizers <a href="http://katyal.livejournal.com/18164.html">have recognized as successful the</a> <i>spletnik tumor</i> , formed from a pair of words <i>splet</i> (web, web) and <i>dnevnik</i> .  Domestic same fluctuated between tracing the <i>blog</i> and clumsy turnover of the <i>network diary</i> / <i>network journal</i> .  I did not see the Russified Vista, so I don‚Äôt know which of the options I finally stopped at. <br>  Only in two other languages ‚Äã‚Äãthe <i>blog</i> was translated by a native word.  In Greek - the word <i>histology</i> , formed, as well as the long-existing word <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F"><i>histology</i></a> , from the roots of <i>histos</i> (tissue, web) and <i>logos</i> .  And in Arabic - the word <i>mudavvana</i> , from the root of the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD_%2528%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%2529"><i>sofa</i> (entry, magazine)</a> . <br><br>  Ekaterina managed to become famous <a href="http://katyal.livejournal.com/2320.html">not only for her translations</a> : <br><blockquote>  In general, Word (already 6.0) I will remember all my life: someone steal (sorry, stole) a set of diskettes, where, through carelessness during the installation, I hammered my name, and it was recorded in the file setup.inf on the 1st diskette.  This set was then widely replicated by pirates.  I still had a long shout: in one company, when I introduced myself, a man jumped out from behind a partition with joyful shouts ‚Äúis it you ?? !!!  I have your Word worth !!!  I thought you were a fictional person. "  (I wonder how I was not fired). </blockquote><br>  Finally, in her LiveJournal, she complains quite a lot about the Russian keyboard layout, which was created incomprehensibly by whom and incomprehensible how.  Most of all, she, <a href="http://www.artlebedev.ru/kovodstvo/sections/105/">like A. Lebedev</a> , is annoyed by the need to clamp Shift to enter a comma.  Ekaterina also notes that the Russian layout is the only one, except for the American one, that does not use the AltGr key;  and she <a href="http://katyal.livejournal.com/17604.html">proposed</a> to create a new standard Russian layout in which Latin letters and punctuation marks from the American layout would be entered when AltGr was held down. <br>  Unfortunately, in spite of considerable authority (for example, CP-1251 was <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets">officially registered with IANA</a> in the name of Katya Lazhintseva), it never came to update the standard layout. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/105532/">https://habr.com/ru/post/105532/</a></p>
