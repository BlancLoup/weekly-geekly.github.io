  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Aggregators of online trading and the "gray" market</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c71/5ae/1e1/c715ae1e11c9f13dc17793da0a4a2015.jpg"><br>  The Association of E-commerce Companies (ACIT) has proposed to block sites that advertise the "gray" product.  The list includes not only 20 thousand "gray" online stores, but also the largest aggregators - Yandex.Market and Mail.ru Products. <br><br>  The reasons for this discussion are quite simple and have long been known: <br><ul><li>  illegal business (tax recently became interested in the fight against such shops) </li><li>  "Gray" customs clearance (article about <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/madrobots/blog/214529/">iPhones suitcases</a> ) </li><li>  use of well-known trademarks for advertising fakes and counterfeit </li></ul><br>  From the point of view of the aggregator, it is necessary to take measures only if the court makes a decision about the store.  From the point of view of ACIT, which protects the interests of large retailers (the list of members is publicly available), the main thing is the loss of profit.  Yandex.Market is generally good and useful, but there is one nuance.  Let's look at one story about the business associated with online shopping. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Suppose you decided to do some things and sell, for example, mugs under the bark.  I ordered a batch at the factory or in the workshop according to my own drawings, opened the tray in Khimki, you sell it.  And after all, the people liked your circles, they were snapping up.  Then you order at the factory a whole container of mugs, already several models of different shapes and with drawings.  And at one fine moment you realize that in Khimki all these mugs were poured, but they don‚Äôt need more. <br><br>  Then you go to the kites (wholesale suppliers), and they say to you: ‚ÄúYour birch bark circles are marvelously good.  We would have bought ourselves at home, but we want to make a 120% margin from the air.  You either raise the retail, or drop us the purchase, or <s>go to the woods</s> to continue trading from the tray in your province. ‚ÄùWell, you tightened your belt, lowered your margin from 20 to 5%, raised the retail one and a half times, but agreed with the kites .  And you sit contentedly, you draw new drawings, and your circles on the shelves and in Murmart are in other non-videos.  In the market all the reviews are good, buyers and the rod.

      And everything would be fine, but on the neighboring shelves there are ordinary plastic mugs of Vanka Erokhin.  Only they are not the original design, but a bad Chinese OEM, and they stand the same way, simply because Vanka is a greedy and, in general, dishonest person.  Well, the people seem to understand what is happening, sales of Vanka are falling.  But Roly, he is not only dishonest, he is also dodgy.  He bought your mugs 5 pieces, and gave them to his friend, who keeps a stall in the village of Kruzhkino.  Said sell at half price.  The very stall in the market registered and posted the price tag. <br>  Here people are looking for circles on the Internet, they see a good price.  They go to the store and say: ‚ÄúI saw on the Internet, in the village of Kruzhkino the same circles are half as much.  You are vile deceivers and will not buy from you anymore! ‚ÄùThe store runs to the wholesalers kites, says what nonsense ?!  And the vultures to you, with the words: ‚ÄúYou are unfinished man, you wanted to throw us?  Take your mugs back from the stores, and go home with them. ‚ÄùAnd they took it to the release, and even with a delay. <br><br>  You sit at home, in the courtyard the dump truck of mugs from the shops is a mountain, and you only get money from the sold in a week, and even a little, for the ruble collapsed 4 times in that time.  And so, your business fell apart, you yourself sit without money, and the money in the yard rot in the form of unnecessary goods, which, perhaps, the stove is now drown.  And Vanka Erokhin, look, only rubs his hands and drives on the Lexus.  And you think that it was necessary to lower the money for women and other joys of life, and not to invest in clubs.  Now even for vodka and a magazine with naked women is not enough. <br><br>  I will answer frequent questions to this story in advance. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">The market has nothing to do with it, it's all Ivan Davidovich Erokhin is to blame</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  You understand this with your mind, but if Vanka Erokhin sends his brother a face-cut armature to you, then you will be offended only by the customer or will you offend his punitive tool?  After all, he wouldn‚Äôt have a brother with fittings - you wouldn‚Äôt get it in the face either, and so a good brother, with him you can drink vodka and drive non-Russians.  And then in the face.  So you want to ban fittings, well, and brothers at the same time.  I'm all for what, good instruments as long as people play by the rules. <br></div></div><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Well, here is your b2b.</b>  <b class="spoiler_title">From the point of view of the average person - he found out where he was, and went to buy the van of your production at Vanka at half price.</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The fact of the matter is that he didn‚Äôt buy - Vankin took a mug for himself, and doesn‚Äôt remove the price tag from the Internet, so even those who came to his Kruzhkino will not receive anything either and they will think that the manufacturer is to blame, and that‚Äôs all Roly in the market tweaked.  Just so you can not hang out the price tag, and so there is a piece of paper, won, they say, I had five of those mugs, and put such a price.  Here it is. <br></div></div><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Well, I would be on the site of the inhabitant, returning home, I would write there that they were cheating.</b>  <b class="spoiler_title">Although not everyone does, of course.</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  He will write.  It does not matter to him that this seller is a fraud, he will write that your company‚Äôs circles are solid lindens.  And will not understand.  And the seller will tell him, they say, they have ordered, we are waiting for a month of mugs, but the manufacturer yulit and does not bring it. <br></div></div><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Well, I do not even know ... There is a very clear separation and two different buttons review about the product and feedback about the store.</b>  <b class="spoiler_title">How can they be confused something.</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  You do not understand, the seller of the type and not in the business, the manufacturer is the culprit with his words, the delivery is delaying. <br></div></div><br><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/jadestern/" class="user_link">Jadestern</a> shared his <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/jadestern/" class="user_link">story</a> , so the answers may be a bit late. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/220725/">https://habr.com/ru/post/220725/</a></p>
