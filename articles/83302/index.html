  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Comparative review of Tweetie2 and TwitBird</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello everybody.  As part of this post, I want to conduct a comparative review of two twitter clients for iPhone / iTouch - <strong>Tweetie2</strong> and <strong>TwitBird</strong> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwriting is as follows.  In general, I always love to test software.  And after going through several twitter clients, I chose TwitBird.  Convenient, beautiful, even push notifications are there.  But at one point, I was pissed off by a crash when I received notifications about all the references to my followers ... At that moment, I turned my eyes back to the App Store in search of an alternative.  I didn‚Äôt have to think much for a long time, I confess, I have long been looking at Tweetie2, which, judging by the reviews, is very, very good-looking.  What was my surprise when I bought it ... But more about that below. <br><br>  Programs are visually simply copied one over the other.  I will not judge who stole from whom.  Everything in order, let's start with the accounts screen: <br><br> <a href=""><img title="Introductory screen (click to view)" src="http://i-generation.ru/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/IMG_0009.png" width="160" height="240"></a> <a href=""><img title="Introductory screen (click to view)" src="http://i-generation.ru/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/IMG_0433.png" width="160" height="240"></a> <br>  Of the differences - only a slightly different arrangement of buttons, the ease of use of which, in general, is a matter of habit.  But the information content is obviously better for TwitBird - here you immediately have the number of your readers, and, much more importantly, the number of unread messages.  According to this criterion, TwitBird gets a point <strong>0: 1</strong>

     <a href=""><img title="Main screen (click to view)" src="http://i-generation.ru/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/IMG_0011.png" width="160" height="240"></a> <a href=""><img title="Main screen (click to view)" src="http://i-generation.ru/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/IMG_0434.png" width="160" height="240"></a> <br>  The next screen differs more.  In Tweetie2, this is a friend tape right away, while in TwitBird it is an auxiliary menu, which, although it does not provide direct access to tweets, has gathered a lot of options for issuing it.  Here is a list - tape, replays, directs, push settings, drafts, search, coming tweets, trends, own profile, saved links, people search, global time tape.  I will not argue whether this version of the home screen is more successful or not, everything is also an amateur - someone likes instant access to the tape, someone has a functional menu.  Tweetie gets a point for quick access to the tape, TwitBird - for functionality.  <strong>Score 1: 2</strong> <br><br> <a href=""><img title="Ribbon (click to view)" src="http://i-generation.ru/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/IMG_0011.png" width="160" height="240"></a> <a href=""><img title="Ribbon (click to view)" src="http://i-generation.ru/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/IMG_0435.png" width="160" height="240"></a> <br>  Compare the screens of the common tape.  The functionality of this screen is also not significantly different.  The advantage of Tweetie2 is the built-in live-search string on the tape, which is not in TwitBird, but the need for this feature is doubtful whether the not-so-needed function needs to be carried to the screen of the tape ... In TwitBird, there is a button for filtering tweets tweet, which is extremely convenient if you have to be distracted from checking the time-tape for a considerable time.  At the same time, with a large number of unread tweets, Tweetie2 does a sidebar - to put it simply, it leaves the last couple of tens, replacing the rest with a clickable insert that holds the rest of the unread tweets.  In my opinion, scrolling does not take much time, but clicking on the sidebar with the expectation of loading is not instant.  For the convenience of TwitBird gets another point.  <strong>Score 1: 3</strong> <br><br> <a href=""><img title="Quick menu (click to view)" src="http://i-generation.ru/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/IMG_0012.png" width="160" height="240"></a> <a href=""><img title="Extended menu (click to view)" src="http://i-generation.ru/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/IMG_0013.png" width="160" height="240"></a> <a href=""><img title="Quick menu (click to view)" src="http://i-generation.ru/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/IMG_0437.png" width="160" height="240"></a> <br>  The quick tweet menu differs drastically; in Tweetie2, it is a slide that requires some skill (it is even more difficult to slide a tweet), which provides five functions: replay, attachment view, profile view, mark favorites, further menu (about it later).  In TwitBird, the menu is invoked by the usual long tap, which provides the three most necessary functions - replay, retweet (old school), to mark with favorites. <br>  Returning to the advanced context menu Tweetie2 - you can find a retweet (new style) in it, quoting a tweet (which, apparently, should have done an old-school retweet, but instead adds a strange mark ‚Äú/ via @twitter_user‚Äù, which, in my opinion, not used), post a link to a tweet (conveniently, I agree), send a tweet by e-mail, translate. <br>  At this point, TwitBird will get a point for conciseness and the removal of the most popular functions to the fore in a convenient form, but Tweetie2 alas will be left without a point.  It seems to be rich and functional, but it is so bushy and inconveniently implemented that ergonomics leaves much to be desired.  <strong>Score 1: 4</strong> <br><br> <a href=""><img title="Profile page (click to view)" src="http://i-generation.ru/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/proft2.png" width="160" height="240"></a> <a href=""><img title="Profile page (click to view)" src="http://i-generation.ru/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/proftb.png" width="160" height="240"></a> <br>  Considering the user profile page, for the first time you are happy for Tweetie2.  Although it is arranged slightly worse than TwitBird with the similarity of the main elements, the functionality is extensive and offers instant use of third-party support services, such as Tweet Blocker, Follow Cost, Favstar.fm, Overlapr ... <strong>Account 2: 4</strong> <br><br> <a href=""><img title="Attachments (click to view)" src="http://i-generation.ru/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/IMG_0016.png" width="160" height="240"></a> <a href=""><img title="Attachments (click to view)" src="http://i-generation.ru/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/IMG_0440.png" width="160" height="240"></a> <br>  Separately, I want to say about work with attachments.  An order of magnitude better, in my opinion, it is implemented in TwitBird, for which he will unconditionally get a point.  Well, tell me, why upload a full picture to display only a thumbnail of 1x1 cm ???  In TwitBird, after waiting <em>the same</em> time, you will see a picture inscribed on the screen.  Further behavior of the programs is completely the same - when you click on the reduced version, the picture is loaded completely.  <strong>Score 2: 5</strong> <br><br> <a href=""><img title="Direct (click to view)" src="http://i-generation.ru/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/IMG_0019.png" width="160" height="240"></a> <a href=""><img title="Direct (click to view)" src="http://i-generation.ru/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/IMG_04421.png" width="160" height="240"></a> <br>  Regarding writing posts / directors, everything is also not straightforward here.  On the one hand, I am absolutely unclear about the reason for directing 280 characters in TwitBird, while the direct limit is 140 characters, but somehow it works.  Secondly, the functionality of the message writing window seemed to me richer in TwitBird: Here you can change both your account and the recipient of the letter, and the auxiliary menu contains more popular functions, such as adding a voice note, the #nowplaying tag for the player currently playing songs or any iPod available.  Shrinker for URLs, geotag and hashtag from previously typed ones are in the list in the lower right corner.  TwitBird again deserves a point.  Finish line.  <strong>Score 2: 6</strong> <br><br> <a href=""><img title="Update (click to view)" src="http://i-generation.ru/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/IMG_00211.png" width="160" height="240"></a> <a href=""><img title="Update (click to view)" src="http://i-generation.ru/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/IMG_04431.png" width="160" height="240"></a> <br>  Finally, I want to say that the similarities in the interfaces of the programs suggest various ideas that either Atebits LLC or Nibiru Tech LTD borrowed the best practices of its competitors.  Well, how can it turn out that the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãupdating the tape by pulling it down (see screenshot) came absolutely at the same time into the heads of the designers of both studios ... <br><br>  However, it is time to sum up.  I used both programs for quite a long time, so I think that I can judge their usability with a fair degree of objectivity, and on this point, as well as on points (with a score of <strong>2: 6</strong> ), TwitBird 2.2.1 undoubtedly wins.  By the way, if you have already used Tweetie2, for comparison, you can download the ad-supported version of TwitBird Free for free, which differs from the paid versions only by the presence of ads and the restriction of 2 twitter accounts, and make your verdict.  Well, I personally got the impression that Tweetie is just a not so successful attempt to copy TwitBird.  Thank you all for your attention, your opinions and objective criticism will be glad to read in the comments. <br> <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/tweetie-2/id333903271%3Fmt%3D8"><img title="Tweetie2 on the App Store" src="http://i-generation.ru/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/tw.png" width="171" height="171"></a> <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/twitbird-pro/id317777108%3Fmt%3D8"><img title="TwitBird 2.2.1 Pro (choice of Idea_generator) on the App Store" src="http://i-generation.ru/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/tb.png" width="171" height="171"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/83302/">https://habr.com/ru/post/83302/</a></p>
