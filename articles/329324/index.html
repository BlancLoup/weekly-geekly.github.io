And each time, in the comments in the questionnaires, we were asked more stories about the projects of real customers, more practical work! <br><br>  And we invented and implemented <b>DevCon School: free for participants of the event with deep immersion</b> .  Despite its relatively short history, this name has become a brand and a kind of quality mark.  We are asked to conduct them again and again.  A special place is occupied by large DevCon School, which we conduct twice a year.  Unlike ordinary ones, there are several topics in them, and most importantly, it is possible to choose exactly how to get acquainted with these topics: intensive courses or master classes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/a28/3ab/e25/a283abe2592e49029a5b33066ff4c7ac.jpg">

      So, let's see what we are preparing for the 12 master classes available on June 1 at DevCon School: Future Technologies, which will be held in Digital October. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Master Classes </h3>  We have tried to prepare for you the most interesting and useful program of master classes.  A total of 12 workshops are planned, during the event, if you attend the entire master class, you can post only 3 workshops.  Below you will find a list of master classes with time, speakers and a brief description, which I hope will help you make the right choice. <br><br>  You can <a href="https://events.techdays.ru/Future-Technologies/2017-06/apply">register for any master class</a> and finally choose where you will go during the conference.  The master class rooms are filled according to the principle: ‚Äúthe first one came, the first one got to the master class‚Äù and closed as far as filling. <br><br><h4>  Slot 11:30 - 13:30 (2 hours) </h4>  <b>Azure Service Fabric - a platform for distributed projects in practice</b> , <i>Evgeny Agafonov</i> <br>  Service Fabric is a platform for distributed systems that is already used in a number of production projects inside and outside Microsoft.  At the master class, you will work with the platform in conjunction with the speaker, discuss its use for scalable and fault-tolerant projects and the various tasks arising in the development of cloud applications. <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://events.techdays.ru/Future-Technologies/2017-06/apply">Registration for the conference</a> <br><br>  <b>Postgres in the Azure Cloud</b> , <i>Ivan Panchenko</i> and <i>Alexey Shishkin</i> <br>  The master class will show you how to use Postgres DBMS in the Azure cloud, will demonstrate the basic operations for setting up the DBMS and working with it.  Together with the speaker, you will learn how it works on the example of Postgres Professional's own developments. <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://events.techdays.ru/Future-Technologies/2017-06/apply">Registration for the conference</a> <br><br>  <b>Inherited code refactoring: how to break dependencies?</b>  , <i>Dmitry Pavlov</i> <br>  What if the code was inherited without tests, but really want to refactor? <br>  Pray and go?  Or is there an engineering approach to preparing code for writing tests and safe refactoring? <br>  As part of the master class, you will find live-coding and analysis of the techniques for breaking dependencies. <br>  Sprout method \ class. <br>  Wrap method \ class. <br>  Extract &amp; Override. <br>  Parallel Design. <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://events.techdays.ru/Future-Technologies/2017-06/apply">Registration for the conference</a> <br><br>  <b>We program in the world of Minecraft with the Malmo framework from MS Research</b> , <i>Olga Telezhnaya</i> <br>  Minecraft has become disastrously popular among schoolchildren.  At the master class we will analyze whether it is good, and then we will see how to program in the familiar world, how to teach children, and also think about how to approach the solution of problems of artificial intelligence.  Together we will solve several problems (the language chosen is Python 2.7, if you don‚Äôt know it, that's okay, knowledge of any imperative language will be enough).  The open source framework Malmo was made for researchers who want to develop AI algorithms.  Minecraft license is not required. <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://events.techdays.ru/Future-Technologies/2017-06/apply">Registration for the conference</a> <br><br><h4>  Slot 14:30 - 16:30 (2 hours) </h4>  <b>Microsoft Visual Studio Team Services and Azure for Java developers</b> , <i>Emin Askerov</i> <br>  Listeners of this master class will familiarize themselves with the broad capabilities of the Microsoft Visual Studio Team Services platform to support the life cycle of developing Java applications, as well as Azure Web App Services cloud services for their deployment and management.
