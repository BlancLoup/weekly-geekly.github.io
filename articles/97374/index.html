      One was <a href="http://avrus.habrahabr.ru/blog/63502/">a question</a> . <br>  Another <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/81169/">with a review</a> . <br><br>  But that's not the point. <br>  Actually, I had known before that there were radio stations on the Internet, but somehow it wasn‚Äôt something like that.  And then a couple of free evenings stood out, and I remembered about "this topic." <br>  Google to help us -&gt; shoutcast.com - cheers Smooth Jazz. <br>  Cool and Ice - Nice!  Anything better than the nonsense that sounds in the FM broadcast. <br>  Yes, and I do not have this music in the collection.  Yes, and copyright, again, tired. <br>  And then the people of the type ‚Äúbroadcasts‚Äù - cool broadcasts, I think that practically everyone will be able to find there something to their own taste.  There are no speakers on your home computer.  There were once brazed-brazed ones, but the sonny finally got rid of them as soon as he learned to walk.  There are more anti-vandal "ears."  On the laptop there are no columns (normal). <br><br>  There was a reasonable question voiced in the first article. <br>  It was a long time to order something and take it from somewhere. <br>  In the locality (not Moscow), it is simply impossible to find something similar to that indicated in the comments to the first reference article.  Yes, and all this is unjustifiably expensive, I wanted something with a value of "0" right here and now. <br><br>  But!  I had a similar device in the car, literally: Ritmix FMT-A951 (important for the essence of the situation, not advertising).  Because  I smoke, and at the same time I often forget the cigarette lighter, then due to constant overflowing the power connector broke, and it was left to gather dust ‚Äújust in case‚Äù.  And now - its time has come! <br><br>  Devaysina was finally broken. <br>  I am not an electrician, but I quickly realized that a voltage converter was built into the cigarette lighter socket.  I understood it because there were a lot of ‚Äúresistances‚Äù (resistors?), Which I remembered well from the ‚Äúschool physics‚Äù, because  I received two balls for them.  It remained to understand which of the 12 machine Volts it was converted into.  I do not have a voltmeter, because  I am not at all connected with Electronics, and at first I ‚Äústumped‚Äù.  But!  Hooray - thoughts did not last long, because  On the device there is a USB and a connector for SD / MMC, it was logical to assume that out of 12 it is converted to 5 Volts. <br><br>  The cigarette lighter plug was no longer needed.  It is broken, there is no place to put it in at home, but to buy an adapter 220 -&gt; into the cigarette lighter "you need to go" and "generally broke," and "again deneh to spend."  Reflecting in the same vein, I realized that the voltage converter 12 =&gt; 5 Volt somehow will not be relevant here either.  There is nowhere to put it in without a nest, and it would be very much disgusting to wrap everything up with tape.  Having bitten the converter and left it "in the closet" "under lock and key" "just in case", I finally saw that there were not two, but three wires.  On the converter everything was rosin, and until I bit out the wiring it was not even clear that there was another wire there. <br><br>  It does not matter - still not sorry.  Experimentally, through a sequential rewinding of the wiring to the Molex connector (note that the yellow wire is 12 - and we don‚Äôt need it, it can burn everything) the necessary sequence was calculated.  From Molex, earth is needed - black, and 5 volts - red.  The desired pair of contacts was found very quickly: yellow to black Molex, red to red.  Yes, there were some VC BT GD letters on the shawl, but I didn‚Äôt find anything on the Internet (naturally, there was no concept of the device on the manufacturer‚Äôs website), and it was impossible to understand what these mysterious combinations of Latin capslocks to me, a neophyte.  Google and Yandex on the request "designations on printed circuit boards", but "alas and oh," tons of information on which to spend time was reluctant. <br><br>  Because  The device was supposed to be external in relation to the computer, I decided to ‚Äúpower up‚Äù the power from USB (5 Volt in the same place!).  The wires were ‚Äúshaft‚Äù, cutting off one of them and finding a color marking on the network, I finally connected the device!  Hooray!  EARNED! <br><br>  It remained for the small - to collect all this "more-mening" quality. <br><br>  ‚ÄúNative‚Äù wiring was completely transplanted and in their place very well soldered (with an ordinary and huge 40 watt) soldering iron USB shnye veins. It turned out quite ‚Äúfor myself‚Äù. <br><br>  "In the process of" soldering, I threw out the third posting, since  I was sure that if everything works without him, he would not answer for anything.  Turning on the device, I did not hear anything.  Throwing back all the ‚Äúlogical loops‚Äù, I realized that this posting is an antenna.  Of course, I had to disassemble, solder and assemble again.  Voila!  There is sound, in FM quality, of course, but for the whole house. <br><br>  Is it all?  Walking through the laptop in my few meters, I found that alas - not the whole.  Especially if the "zanykat" vundervaflyu devaysina in the far corner of the computer. <br><br>  The size of the antenna was increased by the usual twist on a torn guitar string (also, as you can see, it was useful), everything was ‚Äútightly‚Äù and ‚Äútightly‚Äù rewound with insulating tape.  The quality of the signal was enough for the whole apartment, the antenna became more than reliable, and there was no possibility of tearing it out, because  String attached and tied in three knots on what's left of the cigarette lighter bracket. <br><br>  Now I listen to the very Smooth (easy? In general - non-stressed) Jazz, which is persistently broadcast from a file-Internet, etc.  in the next room on the mafon that got accustomed in the kitchen, I myself sit here behind the laptop and write this article in this our editor. <br><br>  Unfortunately, not being a photographer, as a prooflink, I can only imagine what the camera of the phone was able to capture in insanely filthy quality and with a forced evening light, but proof! <br><br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/77/8d/778db9f2a66dff86a8e95f775206865e.jpg"></a> <br><br>  It remains to be done so that it does not need to include a computer <br>  By the way, no one will tell you, maybe you saw a review of some good media players, those that can watch videos, etc., preferably with Wi-Fi and inexpensive (although you can say they have Wi-Fi Whistle stick)?  Do they know how to stream audio (if I did not mess up, in general, I‚Äôm talking about the same Internet radio), it‚Äôs very interesting not to turn on the computer for this‚Ä¶ <br><br>  <b>UPD 1</b> : By the way, in these ‚Äútorments‚Äù the device almost did not lose in functionality, I didn‚Äôt burn anything, although during testing I closed the yellow wire of the Molex to the ground, it shortened to sparks.  The flash drive is playing, just tested SD / MMC too, it remains to buy an adapter from the cigarette lighter to USB and you can take the device again on the way! <br><br>  <b>UPD 2</b> : <br>  The public complained of ‚Äúlittle pictures‚Äù.  What is "fake" can be.  Unleash a bolt problem is not.  I'll live a minute without the "MUSIC". <br><br>  +1 Scarf with soldered veins.  The one on the left is the antenna, on the right the entry from USB. <br><br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/0d/7b/0d7b8399907795d3bdc88bc6be2f798c.jpg"></a> <br><br>  +2 The same "most reliable" and "isolated" twist of the antenna on the string, the same bracket, the same string (yes, nylon, Ernie Ball). <br><br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/28/b4/28b467611fb2a14f11c6ee087ed3bd1f.jpg"></a> <br><br>  <b>UPD 3</b> : Missed another important thing.  Yes, on the device there is a jack for connecting an external player, it is involved in the transfer of music from the computer.  That is, the jack under the usual linear output from the speakers or headphones.  BUT!  This is not important, it is important that in the device there is a 2.5 mm cross-section socket, special, such as on Nokia.  On computers, as we all, I hope, know perfectly well, there are no such nests, but there are 3.5.  Included with this transmitter was an adapter cord (reasonable Ritmix, well done here), I, of course, did NOT lose it.  And where is your string?  Yes, if ‚Äúthis trouble‚Äù happened, then in a computer store I saw somehow an ‚ÄúHansa‚Äù adapter from 2.5 ‚Äúfathers‚Äù to 3.5 ‚Äúmothers‚Äù for the same Nokii (99.99 RUB).  I think that it is quite possible to find a 3.5 "dad" -&gt; 3.5 "dad" extension cord.  In this simple way, you can get out of this difficult situation. <br><br>  In general - the owner of the note, dare, gentlemen! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/97374/">https://habr.com/ru/post/97374/</a></p>
