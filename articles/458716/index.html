  <section class="page js-page"><h1>First look at the Delta Amplon RT UPS</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  <em>In the family of Delta Amplon replenishment - the manufacturer introduced a new series of devices with a capacity of 5-20 kVA.</em> </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rr/yc/px/rrycpxcgwyyctlex9flnl04_gja.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  Uninterruptible power supplies Delta Amplon RT are characterized by high efficiency and compact size.  Previously, only relatively low-power models were offered in this family, but single-phase and three-phase devices with power up to 20 kVA appeared in the new RT series.  The manufacturer positions them for use in uninterruptible power supply systems of small computer rooms and server rooms, to protect medical and telecommunications equipment, as well as to further protect critical equipment in large data centers.  Amplon family devices are widely used in small and medium-sized enterprises, in medical institutions, in financial sector and telecommunications companies. </p><br><h2>  Lineup and Topology </h2><br><p>  In the new series, Delta has released three UPS models: there is also 1/2/3 kVA Amplon R / RT, which we do not consider in this review.  We are interested in single-phase Amplon RT for 5, 6, 8 or 10 kVA (200-240 V) and three-phase Amplon RT for 15 or 20 kVA (380‚Äì415 V).  Both models are built on the dual power conversion topology, and their output power factor is one.  Single-phase devices are available to customers in versions with standard and extended battery life, and three-phase devices are available in 3: 1 configurations (three-phase input, single-phase output) and 3: 3 (three-phase input, three-phase output), which are changed using jumper buses. </p><br><h2>  Design and configuration </h2><br><p>  All-in-one UPS Delta Amplon RT designed for floor mounting or mounting in a 19-inch rack.  Single-phase models with standard battery life are equipped with built-in batteries and occupy 4 (5/6 kVA) or 5 (8/10 kVA) units in a rack.  Also installed in them is the default power distribution unit (PDB) and maintenance bypass switch (MBB).  Configurations with extended battery life take up 2 units in height and require connecting an external battery cabinet (EBC) for 2 or 3 units, depending on the type of battery.  There is only one network input in all single phase models.  The efficiency of the device is 95.5% in normal mode (with double conversion enabled) and 99% in economical mode.  Three-phase models occupy 2 units in a cabinet or rack, battery cabinets for them - another 2, 3 or 6 units.  Users have access to configurations with one or two network inputs, and the device efficiency is 96.5% in normal mode and 99% in economy mode.  All UPSs are equipped with an LCD display, which in three-phase models allows you to customize the output configuration.  Devices are easily embedded in racks of popular sizes. </p><br><h2>  Batteries </h2><br><p>  In the RT series, standard external compact (2U) battery cabinets (EBC) with lithium-ion batteries appeared for the first time, which are available for both three-phase and single-phase models.  In addition, customers can purchase cabinets with lead-acid batteries (VRLA).  For unification, all Amplon RT models use the same EBC with a flexible configuration - this allows you to optimize the cost of purchasing the system, scale the battery life in a wide range and simplify inventory management.  Groups of VRLA batteries are mounted in the cabinet using plastic cases, which eliminates the possibility of electrolyte leakage.  Batteries can be replaced individually without replacing the entire group and without stopping the UPS, and plug-and-play is used to connect the EBC. </p><br><h2>  Parallel work </h2><br><p>  Up to four Delta Amplon RT UPSs can be connected in parallel to increase power and redundancy according to the N + 1 scheme (in the single-phase range, only models with extended battery life are supported in the combination).  With this connection, customers also have access to system configurations with common batteries, which can reduce the area occupied by equipment and reduce the load on building structures. </p><br><h2>  Security and Management </h2><br><p>  Delta Amplon RT allows you to customize the connection of loads based on priority and equally effectively feed both active and reactive loads.  They stepwise regulate the speed of the cooling fans, predict their service life and promptly give a signal to replace the faulty fan.  Thanks to intelligent charge-discharge algorithms, battery life is increased, and the built-in diagnostics and aging detection systems allow batteries to be replaced on time.  A graphical LCD display gives staff access to all management and monitoring functions.  USB and RS-232 ports are used to connect to a computer, and the devices also have an RS-485 port for exchanging data using the ModBus protocol or communicating with a cabinet using lithium-ion batteries.  MINI slot allows you to install expansion cards.  Included with the UPS is supplied proprietary software for management and monitoring, as well as devices that are easily integrated with third-party solutions for managing engineering infrastructure. </p><br><h2>  Results </h2><br><p>  Looking at new uninterruptible power supplies and having no real experience in their operation, it is difficult to draw any serious conclusions, but at first glance the update of the popular Delta Amplon family seems successful.  The manufacturer significantly increased the power of devices and made a purely single-phase model line three-phase, without sacrificing its main advantage - compact dimensions and high power density.  These are the youngest models among Delta rack solutions with double energy conversion, but in terms of scalability, they are not inferior to more expensive products and will certainly find their customers in Russia. </p></div>
