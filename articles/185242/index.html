  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Comparison of services for monitoring client sites or insurance for SEO paranoia</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A typical situation, you are promoting the site and instead of the planned positions in search results you get strange results.  But you did everything right?  In the process of analyzing the incident, go to the client's website and discover completely different content.  You cannot swear with a client, we love him, but you really want to be able to control what the client does on his website.  After all, it is you who are to blame for the poor optimization results.  Once again in such a situation, I decided to automate the monitoring of changes on sites and describe how I chose a tool for this. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Task </h4><br>  Find a program that can automate the monitoring of content changes on a third-party site.  The program should be easy to use, quickly and accurately identify changes and clearly show them. <br><br><h4>  Selection criteria </h4><br>  Only web services participate in the selection, because I want to have access to information wherever there is Internet.  Those services that do not possess any unique properties that simplify the solution of the problem are excluded from the selection.  To determine the winner, each service will be evaluated according to the number of points scored - zero (bad), one (normal), two (good). <br><br>  Indicators for which we will score points: <br><ul><li>  Easy to add site for monitoring. </li><li>  Convenience of working with data, if the site has a lot of changes. </li><li>  Clear notifications about changes on the site. </li><li>  The ability to collect additional and useful information that tells about the life and condition of the site. </li><li>  Restrictions on the number of monitored pages within one account. </li><li>  Cost (ideally, you want a free solution or for money, if the price is adequate). </li><li>  Support.  If an error is found, I want to be sure that my problem will be solved quickly. </li></ul><br><h4>  Selection </h4><br><h5>  Shangedetection.com </h5><br>  The most famous service for monitoring changes on web pages launched in 1999.  The project has survived a decade due to its amazing simplicity.  You specify the URL of the page for which you want to track and the e-mail address to which the reports will be sent.  If the service detects a change, a notification is sent to the mail.  In the service itself is available visualization of the changed parts of the page.  In your personal account it is possible within one account to specify multiple pages for monitoring at the same time.  Often the service is very strange reveals a change on the Russian-language sites, carefully look at the screenshot.

If you need to follow the company's website or even worse with an online store, then adding URL links to start monitoring is reminiscent of masochism and 7 circles of hell. </li></ul><br>  <a href="http://www.changedetection.com/">Site</a> <br><br><h5>  Followthatpage.com </h5><br>  Similar to Shandetection.com, but there are 2 key differences: <br>  1) Changes on the page are not shown in the interface, but come to email.  The implementation is controversial, since the visibility of such letters is low, but not if you live in an email client, you might like it. <br>  2) The service itself can offer URLs to be added to the monitoring based on the link you specified, but this is implemented very superficially, since Followthatpage simply pulls out all the addresses it receives from html. <br><br>  Pros: <br><ul><li>  Clear interface. </li><li>  Automatic suggestion of addresses based on the specified link. </li></ul><br>  Minuses: <br><ul><li>  Free of charge, you can follow only 20 pages on one account. </li><li>  Spammed e-mail if the site changes frequently or monitors multiple pages. </li><li>  Information about changes to the pages is not clear. </li></ul><br>  <a href="http://www.followthatpage.com/">Site</a> <br><br><h5>  SORGE.pro </h5><br>  After working with SORGE, a feeling of flying on a spacecraft is created.  Differences: <br>  1) The service monitors not only the changes in the content, but separately tracks changes in the site structure, meta tags, leads its direction finding and checks the status of the domain with WHOIS information. <br>  2) This is the only service that not only offers URLs for monitoring based on the link you specified as Followthatpage.com, but has its own robot to index the specified site.  It works very simply, you specify a link to the main page of the site and SORGE indexes it completely within 1-2 days, presenting the site in the form of a relevant structure.  Tracking changes in the structure of the site is carried out separately, which allows you to learn about the facts, if the client himself will demolish or add several pages.  At the same time, if the page is added, the service will not just find it, but will automatically begin to track further changes to the content on it.  The very same indexing is easily customizable. <br>  3) The changes in the content are not as visual as those of Shangetetection.com, however, it is also convenient to work with them.  It is worth noting that any changes on the site for all types of information collected are saved in the system, which makes it possible to view the history of these changes.  This is convenient when changes to the site were made not immediately, but in a long period of time. <br><br>  Pros: <br><ul><li>  Better automation and simplicity for monitoring the whole site, rather than individual pages. </li><li>  Own robot for indexing with the ability to customize. </li><li>  Convenient work with large amounts of data (sorting, displaying the history of changes). </li><li>  Collection of additional information (site structure, meta tags, direction finding, domain). </li><li>  Detailed documentation and support in Russian. </li></ul><br>  Minuses: <br><ul><li>  Fully paid.  There is a 14-day test period. </li><li>  It is better to start working with the service by reading the documentation, since there are a number of not obvious points in the interface. </li></ul><br>  <a href="http://www.sorge.pro/">Site</a> <br><br><h5>  Femtoo.com </h5><br>  Similar to Shangetetection.com, but remarkable for the possibility of conveniently tracking changes not on the whole page, but on a specific part of it (price, paragraph, table).  Similar functionality exists in SORGE, but the implementation of Femtoo.com is much more convenient.  Just as in SORGE, there is support for a change history, but it is available only on a paid account. <br><br>  Pros: <br><ul><li>  Simple tracking of a separate part of a web page. </li><li>  Users support. </li></ul><br>  Minuses: <br><ul><li>  The free version is very limited in functionality (up to 3 monitored pages). </li></ul><br>  <a href="http://www.femtoo.com/">Site</a> <br><br><h4>  Results </h4><br>  We summarize the results on the previously mentioned criteria and get the following table: <br><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>  Shangedetection.com </td><td>  Followthatpage.com </td><td>  SORGE.pro </td><td>  Femtoo.com </td></tr><tr><td>  Easy to add site </td><td>  0 </td><td>  one </td><td>  2 </td><td>  0 </td></tr><tr><td>  Convenience of work with data </td><td>  one </td><td>  0 </td><td>  2 </td><td>  one </td></tr><tr><td>  Restrictions on the number of pages per account </td><td>  2 </td><td>  one </td><td>  one </td><td>  one </td></tr><tr><td>  Understandable notifications </td><td>  one </td><td>  2 </td><td>  2 </td><td>  one </td></tr><tr><td>  Collect additional data </td><td>  0 </td><td>  0 </td><td>  2 </td><td>  one </td></tr><tr><td>  Cost of </td><td>  2 </td><td>  one </td><td>  0 </td><td>  one </td></tr><tr><td>  Support </td><td>  0 </td><td>  0 </td><td>  2 </td><td>  one </td></tr><tr><td>  <strong>Total:</strong> </td><td>  <strong>6</strong> </td><td>  <strong>five</strong> </td><td>  <strong>eleven</strong> </td><td>  <strong>6</strong> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  "And winner is .." - SORGE.  In terms of ease of monitoring sites, from what I tried, there is nothing better yet.  However, I use it only if the site has more than 30 pages.  In the case when it comes to small promotional sites, it is quite tolerant to work with free Chandetection.com.  But here everyone chooses his instrument to his taste. <br><br><h4>  By the way </h4><br>  I wanted to test the project called Trackedcontent.com, it was very well suited to the review, however, to get to the interface, the developers are asked to pay money. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dfc/977/61c/dfc97761c108020fb9bc1e1914112740.jpg"><br>  <i>No money, no access.</i> <br><br>  If someone ventured to pay $ 49 for a cat in a bag - describe your impressions. <br><br>  Guys, what programs do you solve a similar problem? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/185242/">https://habr.com/ru/post/185242/</a></p>
