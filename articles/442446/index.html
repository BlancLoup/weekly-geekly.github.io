Both for a few decades did not change significantly, at that time, as the market is already filled with new devices. <br><br><hr><br>  So, the first thing that needs to be changed is the operators on the Digital Platform, which can communicate in a human voice.  Many of us have already come across examples where a robot has a pitiful likeness of human speech and an even more pitiful understanding of what a person is responding to, trying to automate some processes.  But today there are solutions that allow you to organize communication with a person in such a way that the latter will not suspect that he is talking to a digital platform.  Here is an example of communication with the bank support service in English.  Watch it. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jlinOSCEY8g" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><hr><br>  Technically, it is quite simple to digitize the call to the Call Center on any topic: the essence of the appeal has a limited set of questions and variations of components.  For example, the Call Center of the Internet provider at the very beginning of the conversation contains 2 basic options: <br><br><ul><li>  - I am your client </li><li>  - I am thinking of becoming your client. </li></ul><br>  The number of conversation topics for the current client is also limited: <br><br><ol><li>  Internet does not work, </li><li>  something with payment </li><li>  change tariff </li></ol><br>  and a maximum of 5 options. <br><hr><br>  We digitize the options, connect to the database and get a modern Call Center, for which you don‚Äôt need to BE IN THE 16TH SESSION, BUT WAIT, YOUR CALL WELL IS VERY IMPORTANT ... <br><br>  Digital operators never get sick, always on the spot without delay and forever friendly.  Not to mention the cost of calls, which is several times lower. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3c4/d9d/abe/3c4d9dabe004d46b83755ccd85fa45fe.png" alt="image"><br><br>  I will write in more detail how the platform is technically arranged and how digital consciousness is formed and trained in one of the following articles.  And now let's move on to the second element, which is time to start changing. <br><br>  Currently, we are seeing more and more new versions of smartphones coming out every year that can protect information through facial features, fingerprints, have a clearer resolution each time, more powerful platforms and look forward to the release of a new version of flagships, BUT! !! <br><br>  we somehow do not take into account that the number of communication channels is also growing.  And some are so interesting that after using it once, then you sit down and no longer think about your life without them.  Here is an example of how conveniently it is at hand for a manager to keep a digital assistant who understands what a person is asking for, can read and write data in CRM systems and even call people on cell phones, and many at the same time.  At the same time, he can interrogate and give out the results of the survey: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2RaKUOKcFWI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  And here is an example of a digital assistant in the kitchen, who at any time can answer numerous useful everyday questions: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZABu6uSWU4w" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  And the same assistant can connect to the Call Center to solve practical problems of its owner.  Here is an example of communication with the support service of a mobile operator (in English): <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/azrDybm1z-Y" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  And what prevents to put such devices in hotel rooms, on tables in a restaurant?  Do you know the current audience of these devices? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f0e/fad/11b/f0efad11bf300f45d297fe56c3e9f825.png" alt="image"><br><br>  And this is a new communication channel, which is practically not occupied by anyone.  About how to start using it with minimal investment will be a separate article. <br><br>  Well, let's see what else you can communicate through: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/69e/f1f/6d1/69ef1f6d11daa9ab07a443f44f52283c.png" alt="image"><br><br>  And that's just what is now in sight.  Cars, coffee makers, refrigerators, washing machines are beginning to talk more and more often, and very soon everything will speak. <br><br><hr><br>  It's time to start thinking about how to transform your business, otherwise it will be like with dinosaurs. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/442446/">https://habr.com/ru/post/442446/</a></p>
