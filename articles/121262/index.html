But this is why no one has done this obvious and useful service. for a motorist?  Maybe I googled badly, but nothing like that could be found. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I do not know by what algorithm the periodic shuffling of road signs occurs, but I have already been in a situation twice when I provided financial assistance to a traffic police officer.  parked in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe prohibition sign.  It happened because of the habit: when you park in one place for several years in a row, you get used to it.  Of course, my inattention is primarily to blame, but I think it is not necessary to explain that the sign can be skipped not only because of this.  Signs often change and are supplemented, they tend to hide behind dense vegetation or crumble by vandals.  In addition, the signs have a zone of action which is determined by eye, which can also lead to a violation.

      To solve this problem, it is necessary to map the signs and then the navigator will know in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat sign the car is now.  As I see it: as soon as I drive through the "stop prohibited" sign, a corresponding sign appears on the navigator screen (for example, translucent in the center for prohibitive signs or in the corner of the screen for other signs).  If a pretty blonde waved her hand when I moved, I wouldn‚Äôt have to painfully remember what the last sign was, just look at the navigator.  You can make the program analyze the speed: at a full stop, if we are in an area where parking is prohibited - an audible alert is issued.  You drive up to the cross - and the sign "no left turn" is already blinking on the screen.  No need to fumble along the roadside, especially if you are in an unfamiliar place.  No, of course it does not hurt to fumble, suddenly a failure or information is outdated, but most of the problems would be solved.  Since the navigator knows what the next sign will be, it can also give recommendations: for example, display a reminder to slow down, because  ahead of the crosswalk. <br><br>  Where will such bases on signs come from?  The basis should be a map from the developers: it is enough to drive slowly along all the routes and make a description.  Further support of the relevance of information - by the motorists themselves.  I think for such a case, active users who expand the base will be enough.  After all, first of all it will be necessary for the users themselves.  If we lived in a normal state, it would be logical that the traffic police itself implemented such a project.  For obvious reasons, this will never happen.  The database format should be made open and alternative versions should be encouraged.  For example, so that motorists could discuss new versions of files on a city forum: how relevant it is, what information is unverified or erroneous. <br><br>  The only minus that I see is that such systems can discourage drivers from learning signs, teaching them to trust the navigator entirely.  In a sense, this is a problem, but the same can be said about the many achievements of progress.  Personally, I learned a lot about doing multiplication with the presence of a calculator in the phone :) As for the implementation, the program should be able to work in conjunction with the running navigation software.  Ideally, manufacturers of such software will make the appropriate extensions in their programs. <br><br>  Also, I even like this option more - the hardware version of the sensor: a small screen (with a diagonal of 1 inch) + a GPS module.  The cost of such a decision will be minimal, which will allow to make it a common practice.  And there, you see, once these machines will be equipped with all the sensors already at the factory.  Also, such a sensor can serve simultaneously as a GPS module for external devices via Bluetooth </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/121262/">https://habr.com/ru/post/121262/</a></p>
