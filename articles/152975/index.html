  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Raspberry Pi from Newark (USA)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/897/03b/862/89703b8628187cbf57d61e390502f22c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Hello to all. <br><br>  It has long been noticed that many people have a problem with ordering a Raspberry Pi from England (Farnell.com store).  Actually, the problem is not so much with the order and delivery, as with the presence of goods on sale (at the track code itself is already lying for the second month).  And on ebay, where prices are traditionally dictated by popularity and affordability, you risk paying double the cost.  Because to those who do not know, I report on the alternative: the Newark.com store in the USA.  Well, under the cut a couple of words about "how everything is there." <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Start and Aspects </h5><br>  After the wait for Raspberry Pi in Farnell was already simply unbearable, I visited the store of the second official distributor - Newark.  However, he, as well as Farnell, is a member of the element14 group.  And, of course, mentioned on the website of the Raspberry Pi team. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Along the way, it turned out 3 points: <br><br><ol><li>  Such a bad rush, as in Farnell, is not there.  Of course, it is not always available, but you can completely go in yourself without any extra gestures (number plates, queues, etc.) and buy when the game came.  At the time of my spontaneous visit there were about 100 pieces. </li><li>  The date of the next receipt is specified more accurately than in Farnell (at the time of writing it is October 28, 2012).  This is much better than "about 2 weeks."  Do I adhere to the deadlines in the store - I find it difficult to say.  But according to the experience of trading with Americans - should b. </li><li>  It turns out cheaper.  On taxes.  Even taking into account the fact that I made a mistake when choosing a postal service, it turned out cheaper. </li></ol><br><br>  True, there is one subjective plus in Farnell before Newark: in Newark there are not so pleasant sales people, and not such a pleasant sales process as in Farnell.  I love it when they sell me professionally and beautifully.  Farnell compared to Newark in this - the gods.  But this is subjective. <br><br><h5>  Checkout </h5><br>  The process, in general, is the most common.  Registration, choice of position and quantity, discarding from related products and special offers, choice of delivery service, payment from the card. <br><br>  There may be problems with the delivery service.  The selection list is a drop list for 40+ positions.  With that 99% of the names I have not heard at all.  That's probably why I made a mistake: instead of Economy Int'l Shipping (either not at all, or missed, or just stuck something in my head) I chose USPS Priority Mail.  At prices the difference is: <br><br><ul><li>  Economy for Small Pack to Ukraine is about $ 6-8; </li><li>  Priority - about $ 40 ($ 39.55 to be exact. I learned this amount much later than the payment from the store manager, and then read it on the arrived box). </li></ul><br><br>  If you can not figure it out and do not want to drive yourself on the cost of another device - feel free to consult the store specialists.  GoogleTranslate, I think they will fully understand. <br><br><h5>  Cash moments </h5><br>  After placing the order does not show the final cost including shipping.  This is mega-uncomfortable.  Payment for 2 Raspberry Pi (model B) blocked the amount of $ 90.30 on the card.  Not the most difficult mathematics says that: <br><br>  $ 90.30 - $ 39.55 = $ 50.75 / 2 = ~ $ 26 <br><br>  Savings, I suspect, arises from tax exemptions (VAT, maybe some more).  In Russia, it may somehow turn out differently, but in Ukraine it turned out like this. <br><br><h5>  Estimated delivery time </h5><br>  Until the moment of receipt at the post office in Kiev, exactly 10 days passed from the moment of payment. <br><br><h5>  Package and Contents </h5><br>  Here in this form, everything fell into my hands: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2da/790/589/2da790589945a9da014368efee49b1a8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7f2/ad9/d97/7f2ad9d9716f862f7233a40a736b2615.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/72e/3bf/20f/72e3bf20f374862c2af4c12c52c42455.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2dc/402/c8a/2dc402c8a3a2705316d8249dbca5a006.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4cb/b9d/8c9/4cbb9d8c9dc3682705209e2f58496bc6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  Cash Moments - 2 </h5><br>  With the calculations there is a small misunderstanding.  Initially, the card was blocked, as I already wrote, $ 90.30.  This amount is still in blocking and not written off permanently. <br>  Somewhere through the week after placing the order, they tried to write off another $ 109.55.  Those.  35 + 35 + 39.55.  It was not possible to write off (the card was blocked for international payments). <br>  I wrote to them, they say so and so.  I was told that, say, you do not worry, we have written off 109 from you, and those 90 will return back after a while.  How much I did not try to explain that they did not write off the second 109, and the first 90 were not added, they stubbornly refused to understand me. <br>  In the end, I got sick of it, and I just asked the seller: ‚ÄúDo I still owe you some money?‚Äù  He replied: "No, the entire amount has been paid in full."  So now I‚Äôll still watch for a couple of months, so what happens with a blocked amount of $ 90, the plot gets some more development. <br><br><h5>  Instead of an epilogue </h5><br>  Use, dear.  Diversify, so skzat.  Quite a normal backup option.  They count money in Newark, of course, a little through one place, but, most importantly, in our favor. <br>  And I will answer the questions, of course, if any should arise. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/152975/">https://habr.com/ru/post/152975/</a></p>
