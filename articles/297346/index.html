  <section class="page js-page"><h1>We work 8 hours a day. Is it possible to start 24/5 production of an intellectual product?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The branding company was tasked with developing a competitive advantage.  During brainstorming, an interesting idea was voiced: set up round-the-clock production of the product.  About her and I want to tell in more detail. <br><br>  Work in several shifts is not a new idea.  In the IT world, work in 2-3 shifts goes to call-centers.  Often technical support is carried out in other time zones, the quality of which is often joked in TV shows.  News agencies also work on this principle. <br>  For example, the IT crowd makes fun of French support. <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/BqnFnWSYzaQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgnC4KyRsFEMnTEVR-qt35kXcJ1eA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  And South Park is mocking the support of Oculus Rift, supposedly located somewhere in India. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/LhFKzJNpLDQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgYi6mrlunZePk-wvgX-_slvHGNUA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Okay, news agencies and call centers are already working 24 hours a day.  But is it possible to apply such a model for other businesses where an intellectual product is produced?  A business operating on this model will be able to increase the speed of product creation up to three times. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  There was a presentation in which it is proposed to establish such a mode of operation in an advertising agency in Sweden.  In this case, all the shifts would be worked out in one at the office: <br><div class="slideshow"><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/2695384&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhq65yTGQhhOXOD2vgZjSdOEnNJOw" width="425" height="355" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><br>  In my opinion, for Sweden such a model is not the most successful due to high compensations for night shifts.  And what if the advertising company had offices in two other time zones?  It would be possible at the end of the shift to make a full brief to colleagues from another office, where work is just beginning? <br><br>  Many IT companies are already working with distributed teams, among them GitHub, Basecamp, WooThemes, Buffer.  Do they take advantage of the fact that there are 24 hours in a day?

      Suppose a programmer is working on a task, and in the last hour of work he connects a Skype colleague from another office to enter the context and a short pair of programming.  This solution will be costly, but the client, for whom speed is important, can appreciate this productivity. <br><br>  Here, of course, the question of communication costs arises.  Can an employee transfer a task to a colleague in another office quickly and without losing important information? <br><br>  In the course of writing a post, I received answers to some questions.  The book ‚ÄúStealing Time: Exploration in 24/7 Software Engineering Development‚Äù was found on the Internet, in which a 24/7 uninterrupted software development scheme was proposed.  The book describes the situation with three offices in different time zones.  Offices are located just in such a way that three shifts are consistently worked through in a day: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/513/1aa/c59/5131aac59fc845229d821b530925986e.png" alt="image"><br><br>  For project management in this proposed methodology Scrum.  In each location, a 1-day sprint takes place, and then synchronous transmission is carried out for another location.  The transfer is a daily meeting (daily scrum). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ac3/3ba/858/ac33ba858eeb41f79234cc9e0b87d8d7.png"><br><br>  The book says that three offices in different time zones is a great scheme.  If there is an urgent and terrible bug, then it can be fixed immediately. <br><br>  From myself I want to add a consideration that production is accelerated even more than three times.  If the project takes 7 working days and starts on Monday, taking into account the weekend, the project will take 9 calendar days.  And with three offices, such a project will be released in just three calendar days.  Well, 24/7 work is still too, 24/5 is enough. <br><br>  Judging by the book, intellectual products can be created around the clock in different time zones, thanks to globalization for that.  I have no experience of participating in such projects, so it is very interesting to hear the opinions of readers on this topic, especially PMs.  How many hours per day do your projects have? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297346/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297346/</a></p>
