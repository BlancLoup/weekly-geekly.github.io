      Let's fantasize how the Internet can become if we turn everything upside down. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Personal accounts </h2><br>  The office is called personal, private not just like that, but because it belongs to you personally.  Do you need a lot of these cabinets?  Is one type bum ass possible to sit on two chairs?  Personally, I need exactly one personal account.  My.  Private. <br><br>  I want to look at the world, being at my desk, which I myself, as it always happens with personal things, made the way I personally feel comfortable. <br><br>  One single login, one single password to one single personal space of mine, access to which only I have.  Mail, SMS, fresh press - all this should be delivered to my doorstep.  I do not have to run around dozens of different places, daily collecting crumbs of information and entertainment. <br><br>  Any, even the most confidential information about you can be stored in your personal account.  In case you forget something.  Or, for example, a complete medical history that you have access to (read-only), your primary care physician, and emergency services. <br>  And after all technologies for all this already exist, and for years! <br><br><h2>  Online stores </h2><br>  Now it‚Äôs not you who come to online stores, but they, with your permission, are subscribed to you (yes, just like in the social network) and when you want to buy a new computer, without leaving your personal space, create a query ‚ÄúI need a computer on fresh iron to work (a lot, a lot of memory and a smart percent) and play (the last generation of Moscow‚Äôs mistress). ‚Äù  And all the stores subscribed to you send you their suggestions.  You just have to choose, pay and wait for the courier. <br><br>  Or another example: you have provided access to your clothing store.  Now, even ordering clothes ‚Äúfrom a photograph‚Äù through the Network, you can be sure that you simply will not even be offered something that does not suit you personally.  But it can go even further - already today there are opportunities based on the knowledge about you to automatically create for you a stylish and trendy wardrobe for the coming season. <br><br>  I can give hundreds more such examples if not thousands. <br><br><h2>  News sites and content projects </h2><br>  The news itself automatically comes to you at the time of their publication due to the fact that you once subscribed to your favorite online media.  Moreover, they make it as simple, clear and convenient as e-mail and SMS do.  Directly to the same folder in your inbox.  Fresh articles of columnists and bloggers get the same way and there. <br><br>  Automatic and manually adjustable filters parse the entire flow of incoming information from blogs, media and social networks themselves filter information, consistent with your personal preferences, which are unknown to anyone except you. <br><br>  Spam is cut off even on approach, due to the fact that your personal account (and already, probably, not even the ‚Äúoffice‚Äù, but the ‚Äúassistant‚Äù) knows about you much more than any third-party service: all your recipients and friends, all your favorite sites and etc. <br><br>  Moreover, blogs and other content projects get a completely legitimate and amazing opportunity to offer you their materials, either for money or for viewing advertisements.  And you, and not they, choose exactly how you agree to pay for the work of the creators of what you are interested in. <br><br><h2>  Social networks </h2><br>  Finally, social networks are transformed into one truly Social, truly Network.  It will be a real-life network of ‚Äúpersonal accounts‚Äù, the connections between which will not be virtually stored on servers belonging to a particular company, which can do whatever it pleases with this ‚Äúgraph‚Äù. <br>  On the contrary, connections will become absolutely real and distributed throughout the Web.  They will begin to exist practically in the physical sense.  Shops are subscribed to your requests, you are subscribed to blogs and offices of your friends and acquaintances.  You are in several groups and read a dozen or two publics with funny pictures. <br><br>  And, most importantly: you and only you have control over those who give access to your personal information. <br><br>  Imagine: ‚Äúnever show these pictures to parents‚Äù;  ‚ÄúThis note is important for me, let everyone see it, and even with a special note,‚Äù ‚ÄúOnly my friends should know that I like this film,‚Äù and so on.  All information, from photos, to scientific articles, created by you belongs to you and only you. <br><br>  You can even run your own blogs with a paid subscription and share your invaluable and unique experience in them if you want it. <br><br>  And all this - without leaving the comfort and functionality of your personal space, your timeline, your office. <br><br><h2>  Applications and Services </h2><br>  Now the applications are not installed in an account on some of your social networks, but directly in your personal account.  In fact, this is the most important and main way of its expansion. <br><br>  YouTube video downloader and Instagram photos, tweeter client (although who will need it already?), Flowers-Against-Zombie-Part-Next and other games, both solo and online.  All this is controlled by you personally and this services receive permission to work with your data, and not you meekly follow the requirements of the services. <br><br><h2>  Search engines </h2><br>  The dream of all search engines will come true: to know you personally so well as to provide search results that are ideal for you.  Search engines will be able (with your permission, of course) to study your addictions, and only you can decide what to show and what not. <br><br>  Yes, SEOs will hardly be happy, because the very notion of ‚Äúgo to the top of the search‚Äù disappears.  It will only be possible to ‚Äúgo to the top of the search for the specific query you specifically for your specific language‚Äù. <br><br><h2>  Summary </h2><br>  Very similar to utopia, I agree.  But for some reason it seems to me that people should be enough for grass.  It's time for grass to start being for people.  A person, a person, his preferences and connections - that‚Äôs what the Internet, social networks and online stores wouldn‚Äôt be without. <br><br>  Once again.  It is completely real.  Almost all the necessary technologies already exist.  Interestingly, for the implementation of such a version of the web, the technologies buried by the Internet community are very well suited.  Try to warm up, guess what. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/193426/">https://habr.com/ru/post/193426/</a></p>
