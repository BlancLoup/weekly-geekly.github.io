It's no secret that Linkedin is one of the key resources for finding new customers.  And in conjunction with <a href="http://founderdating.com/">Founderdating, it</a> helps to attract a large number of leads in a relatively short period of time.  At the same time, this platform has become a place of frank failures for many companies from the CIS.  In an attempt to sell a product, promotion service, or development service, many managers put in their efforts with the same approach as on UpWork or Freelancer.  As a result, we get a situation in which Western counterparties have the impression that at least the next ‚Äúguys from India‚Äù are sitting on our side, at the most - just rude smarties who have nothing to do with.  Total: leads - 0.001%, conversion - in the same borders. <br><br>  What can be done in this situation? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I offer my own vision of solving this problem.  If you want to expand the list, you can write your suggestions below, in the comments or send me a personal message.  Your information will be placed at the end of the list with a link to the author.

    <h2>  7 rules for working with Linkedin </h2><br>  <b>1) Reading messages.</b>  All messages that we publish are pre-checked, preferably by several people.  It is a common situation when the offer of services or services makes typos, errors. <br><br>  <i>Note:</i> <br><br><ul><li>  Slang is not allowed.  Nobody, for example, in Sweden, will try to understand your joke or the idiom from the ‚ÄúRU segment‚Äù.  100% damage guaranteed. </li><li>  Pay attention to the name of the interlocutor.  Send a message to Mike, titled "Hi, Jane" - in most cases it will mean the end of communication.  The same applies to the confusion with the names of client projects. </li></ul><br>  <b>2) Compliance rules.</b>  Choose specific people from your area of ‚Äã‚Äãinterest.  No need to add to everyone in a row and send a template letter in the hope that 1-2 people out of 100 will answer you.  This of course will happen with a high probability and you will get your 1-2%, but your 3-5 applications out of 100, about what you are spamming, will also be.  And there - goodbye account for a week / month. <br><br>  <b>3) Write specifically</b> what you want. <br>  Here and so everything is clear. <br><br>  <b>4) The ideal scheme to start communication:</b> <br><br><ol><li>  We write the invitation letter.  Let it be short, but you know what you want from a person?  Well, justify it with one sentence.  If you can not - there is nothing to write and "love brains" to others.  And yes, 80% of people do not read them.  But the remaining 20% ‚Äã‚Äãnot only read, but also respond.  And let them not be interested, but they can remember you and recommend someone. <br><br></li><li>  We answer questions.  If you could not justify your invitation or simply were too lazy to write a custom invitation, and the potential leader began to ask what you need from him - we answer extremely concisely. <br><br></li><li>  Do not copy-paste 4-5 paragraphs of the text in the hope that they will be read.  It's easier to ban you. </li></ol><br>  <b>5) Planning to work seriously with LinkedIn?</b>  We buy Sales Navigator.  Only 50 euros (or 2.28 euros per day) and a lot of save hours of life you get into the bargain.  As well as a bonus - excellent filtering by countries, positions, positions, etc.  In fact, we remove the problem from point # 2 completely. <br><br>  As an option, if there was enough money only for alloy wheels for the head of Audi, but for promotion it is not at all, we have <a href="http://italabre.blogspot.com/2011/01/advanced-google-boolean-search.html">fun with Google operators</a> . <br><br>  <b>6) We keep records of sent messages.</b> <br>  Contact database should be shared.  Clients openly enraged when 3-5 company managers send them applications with the same templates for a couple of months. <br><br>  <b>7) Do not break insolently.</b>  Need to do research?  Want to get feedback, recommendation, be sure to ask the user.  ‚ÄúClassics of the genre‚Äù: some form of research is sent to a group of clients asking them to do something when no one asked you to.  And then another 3-4 letters in pursuit within a month with the question ‚ÄúWhat is not filled?‚Äù, In order to surely cause complete disgust in a person. <br><br>  If you are going to achieve the goal (Ex: <a href="http://blog.ubertesters.com/potential-advantages-of-ios-10-for-mobile-app-development-and-testing/">agree on a guest post, which we did in a week</a> ), be sure to arrange, at least for yourself, a sequence of letters and 3-4 options for putting the question in each. <br><br>  I hope that this list will help you achieve the goal.  Take care of your strength and nerves of others. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/313262/">https://habr.com/ru/post/313262/</a></p>
