  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Nokia or MeeGo tablet on the march</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I'll start from afar.  Nokia planned to break into the market of laptops, netbooks and other devices with its Maemo operating system, this solution was created for various devices, but they started with the N800 / N810 tablets and then expanded the functionality to the N900 phone.  At some point, the company realized that they could not develop this area independently and joined Intel in order to participate in the MeeGo project (based on Moblin), but the Nokia mobile interface (Maemo 6, to be precise) is retained for mobile phones.  As a general partner of MeeGo, the company wants to be at the head of this process.  Therefore, in mid-September in London, it will probably show not only the N9 (the first MeeGo phone), but also its tablet. <br><br>  In the hands of this toy is not yet held, but as soon as I get out of my resort, I will gladly twist it.  In the meantime, I will share what I know, heard, saw in the pictures, and at the same time those videos that have been posted online today. <br><br>  So let's get down to the tablet.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The Tablet UX interface is shown in the video; this is a pre-alpha version that can show you what the system is capable of. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/QqeeQd-YNL0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiXLSobzlh2zhsH6Z6nY1g7q99TCQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  But everyone knows that, there is no interesting information here.  Let's talk about what is known to few (interpret it as a category of rumors and fabrications, so that later there will be no disappointments, I share what I saw on paper). <br><br>  So, the first tablet from Nokia will be in the category of the enemy iPad.  This impression is made up of pictures, the design is somewhat reminiscent of an enlarged N8.  I do not know whether they did it on purpose or not, but the metal edging on the body, rather bright colors.  Complete opposite.  They say that about 100 prototypes have already been manufactured and the screen diagonal can be 7 or 9 inches.  About the model with a small screen diagonal, I do not know anything.  Only 9 inches.  Covered with glass.  Supported multitouch. <br><br>  What's inside.  the most interesting and intriguing question.  It should not be ARM, but Digitimes sources claim that ARM is inside.  We'll see.  Not spun, I can not argue.  But it is curious.  If ARM, then it will be a unique solution, unlike all other tablets on MeeGo. <br><br>  We go further.  There are USB connectors, indicating that you can connect peripherals.  Including a keyboard.  This, in my opinion, is a huge gain compared to the same iPad.  In terms of communication, this device looks like, all protocols are supported, you want to distribute the Internet, to your health. <br><br>  The shell will be similar to the standard with one difference (the same in the telephone version).  Integration of social services from Nokia (IM, Twitter, Facebook work through Nokia's intermediate server to be put together in one application).  In principle, it is possible to refuse this pleasure and use separate applications for these services (there will be no support for OVI then). <br><br>  Time to market.  1st quarter of 2011.  It is unlikely that he will appear earlier.  And then, it will be a limited number of markets and in order to reduce the cost of the model, it will be offered as an operator-subsidized solution.  Read, separately, this toy will be quite expensive (I think at the level of Booklet 3G minus 25 percent, if we talk about Russia).  But considering that the cost has not yet been discussed by anyone, it‚Äôs too early to make plans. <br><br>  In short, everything I remembered from what I saw.  The question of time and price, the main.  The device does not tolerate consciousness, does not offer something too interesting.  In my opinion, since I already have an iPad and it is being used quite hard by children as a learning device, plus games.  Sometimes I watch movies on the road, I write small texts.  Upon returning to my homeland, I will gladly get one of the prototypes and play with it.  In Russia, there should be quite a lot of them, as software is developed for this device with us. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/97056/">https://habr.com/ru/post/97056/</a></p>
