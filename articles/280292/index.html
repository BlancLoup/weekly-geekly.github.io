  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Linux for beginners or what can a girl teach?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Greetings, colleagues.  For a long time, the NetSkills project has been devoted exclusively to networking technologies - <b>Young Fighter Course, GNS Basics, UNetLab</b> .  However, the following question was increasingly heard from subscribers: <b>‚ÄúWhat else should a network engineer or a system administrator know?‚Äù</b> .  Here you can bring a large list of technologies / areas and finally conclude that knowing only the network is <b>not enough</b> !  It is clear that a successful career requires much more.  Therefore, it was decided to expand the project and to begin to launch the course ‚ÄúLinux for beginners‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c3d/0c5/cf9/c3d0c5cf9a6d473992a849df75b88afc.png" alt="image"><br><br>  An important detail, the teacher - a <b>girl</b> who recently joined the project <b>NetSkills</b> .  <b>What can a girl teach?</b>  If you are interested, welcome under the cat‚Ä¶ <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>The goal of the course</b> is to learn the basics of administering Linux operating systems.  The material is mostly practical and contains a minimal amount of theory.  The course is suitable for beginners as system administrators who are engaged in setting up the company's servers, and for network engineers, because  Most of the network equipment is running Linux (especially considering the trend of import substitution), so the skills to work with this system definitely will not hurt them.  Anyway, every self-respecting IT person is simply obliged to possess the basic skills of working with Linux systems.  The value of such an employee immediately grows.

In the basic course, we will look at the basic concepts, learn how to perform the initial server configuration, and also configure the Internet access gateway.  In the advanced course, we will look at how to deploy a Linux-based server infrastructure for a company. <br><br>  <b>The basic course includes the following topics:</b> <b><br></b>  <b>1. Objectives of studying the Linux operating system, its main advantages.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>2. Creation of virtual machines.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>3. Installing the CentOS operating system.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>4. The structure of the Linux file system.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>5. The main commands needed to work in the Linux console (cd, ls, man, grep, find, cp, mv, rm, etc.).</b> <b><br></b>  <b>6. Network configuration in CentOS.</b>  <b>Utilities Putty, WinSCP.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>7. Basics of security.</b>  <b>Establishment of new users in the system.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>8. Installing packages.</b>  <b>Batch manager</b>  <b>Repositories</b> <b><br></b>  <b>9.Mc file manager, nano text editor and network utilities (ifconfig, nslookup, arp, telnet).</b> <b><br></b>  <b>10. Setup of an Internet access gateway.</b>  <b>Iptables</b>  <b>NAT.</b>  <b>DHCP.</b> <br><br>  <b>So why learn Linux and what are its benefits?</b>  I think we should start with the definition. <br>  GNU / Linux is a family of unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel.  The operating systems from this family are usually distributed free of charge in the form of so-called distributions, which in addition to the operating system also contain a set of application software (that is, essentially an assembly).  There are a huge number of Linux distributions today, but almost all of them are descendants of the three main distributions: Debian, Slackware and Red Hat.  Learn more about GNU / Linux and distributions <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B1%25D1%2583%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2_Linux">here</a> and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B1%25D1%2583%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2_Linux">here</a> . <br><br>  Perhaps someone had a question: why is GNU / Linux, and not just Linux.  The thing is that Linux is just a kernel, while GNU / Linux is an operating system.  However, Linux can be called both the kernel and the OS - and so it will be right. <br><br>  Relatively speaking, the OS consists of two parts: <b>kernel space</b> and <b>user space</b> .  Kernel space is a kernel that directly interacts with devices in the system, maintains them and performs configuration.  In our case, this is the Linux kernel, the development of which began in 1991 by Linus Torvalds, who was a student at that time.  It supports multitasking, dynamic libraries, virtual memory, deferred loading, most network protocols, and a productive memory management system and is distributed under the GNU GPL license, i.e.  free.  You can learn more about the kernel itself and its ‚Äúfascinating‚Äù version numbering system <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AF%25D0%25B4%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE_Linux">here</a> .  Users work in the user space (application space), and this in turn files.  Generally speaking, everything in Linux is represented by files ‚Äî the settings, the applications themselves, even the processes.  This is very handy when setting up and when you are trying to figure out why everything is broken. <br><br>  Linux distributions are distributed mainly under the GNU General Public License - a license for free software.  The purpose of the GNU GPL is to give the user rights to copy, modify, and distribute (including on a commercial basis) programs, and to ensure that users of all derivative programs will receive the rights listed above. <br><br>  <b>In addition to the above indisputable advantages of this OS, it also has a number of features:</b> <b><br></b>  <b>1. Security</b> <b><br></b>  <b>2. Performance</b> <b><br></b>  <b>3. Reliability</b> <b><br></b>  <b>4. Scalability</b> <b><br></b>  <b>5. Hardware compatibility</b> <b><br></b>  <b>6.Not import substitution required.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>7. Linux administrators have a higher salary than regular administrators.</b> <br><br>  Due to the above listed features, Linux is widely used and is used in many areas: critical services (high-speed trains in Japan, CERN, air traffic control systems), social networks, search services, as well as mobile phones, tablets, PCs, ATMs and automotive electronics. <br><br>  Generally speaking, based on Linux, you can do a lot of things, but we will focus on more everyday things.  Suppose that in a company with a large number of users, you need to deploy the server infrastructure, i.e.  users need to give access to the Internet, prohibit sitting on social networks during business hours, organize corporate e-mail, file server, etc.  What can we do based on Linux?  In fact, very much. <br><br>  We can: <br>  <b>1. Set up a software router / Internet access gateway with firewall and DHCP server functions</b> <b><br></b>  <b>2. Limit user access to the Internet using a proxy server</b> <b><br></b>  <b>3.Organize the mail server for corporate mail</b> <b><br></b>  <b>4. Create a web server for a corporate site and internal web resources</b> <b><br></b>  <b>6. Set up primary and secondary DNS server</b> <b><br></b>  <b>7. Expand file server</b> <b><br></b>  <b>8. Collect backups from other servers</b> <b><br></b>  <b>9. Expand the logging server to collect events from other servers.</b> <br><br>  We will develop such a scheme in the framework of this course. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e00/f18/227/e00f182278ea4d019ab8beb37ee3b867.PNG" alt="image"><br><br>  I guess this is the first lesson you can finish. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/280292/">https://habr.com/ru/post/280292/</a></p>
