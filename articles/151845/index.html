Of course, the main indicator is profit.  There is also a number of customers, and brand awareness.  But there is one criterion about which I would like to talk specifically - the amount of data.  It is logical that the larger the company, the more information it has to work from day to day.  Every year, data volumes in organizations continue to grow.  Linear, exponentially or exponentially?  Here it is hardly advisable to give an average estimate.  But you yourself understand that in the era of general transition to the SED, the need for efficient data storage systems is obvious. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Of particular interest in terms of the ‚Äúbattlefield‚Äù is the SMB segment.  Today, it acts as a ‚Äúborder zone‚Äù, where the interests of both vendors, previously engaged exclusively in the corporate sector of the market, and manufacturers of the ‚Äúhome‚Äù level, who gained fame on PCs and routers and decided to rise to the industrial level, converge.  As usual, when there is an increased offer, the buyer wins.  As a result, he can get the best technology at a very "tasty" price.  Well, since this is a Dell corporate blog, we also have something to offer. <br><br>  This fall, Dell introduced its new network storage solutions in Russia - the PowerVault NX3300 and NX3200.  If you try to describe them in a nutshell, you get something like the following: these are high-capacity systems designed to optimize data storage and conveniently exchange files / data blocks, as well as to efficiently manage them.  And all this, as mentioned above, with an eye on small business companies.  Well, let's take a look in more detail.

      <b>The Dell PowerVault NX3300</b> is a comprehensive hardware and software solution for storing, managing, sharing and ensuring high availability of block and file data.  Consists of a fault-tolerant network storage device (NAS gateway) integrated with specialized software based on the Windows Storage Server 2008 R2 platform <s>(Nordic character, single)</s> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6d7/edd/057/6d7edd057e47420daa60c274b3d77567.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The platform itself is based on an optimized release of flexible and reliable Windows Server 2008 R2 file services, enhanced by a number of useful technologies, such as file duplication elimination and iSCSI Software Target software, helping to create unified file and data store repositories. <br><br>  Why iSCSI, but not, say, FC (fiber channel)?  There is no secret - because of the cost of the solution.  In fact, iSCSI technology only requires an Ethernet interface or any other TCP / IP compatible network.  In this case, there is no need to acquire expensive equipment and acquire special knowledge in the field of hardware, without which it is often impossible to operate FC storage networks.  But back to the NX3300. <br><br>  The device is made in a rack-mount 1U form factor and, depending on the needs of the company, supports building up the cluster configuration from two to sixteen devices.  SIS (Single Instant Storage) technology provides simple file-level deduplication, and the File Services Resource Manager (FSRM) File Services Resource Manager provides a single interface for managing and monitoring CIFS / SMB and NFS file services, which reports on how files are used.  In turn, the File Classification Infrastructure file classification infrastructure from Windows Server 2008 R2 allows administrators to automate the processes of classifying and implementing policies for the most efficient data management: set the classification validity periods, set up tasks and reports. <br><br>  The advantage of the PowerVault NX3300 is the lack of binding to a specific storage family, which means variations are possible.  For example, use a PowerVault NX3300 NAS gateway with an existing PowerVault MD, EqualLogic, or Compellent disk array.  Do not forget about the 12th generation Dell PowerEdge server clusters based on the Windows Storage Server 2008 R2 platform, which are able to work even at very high temperatures.  The trend of "green IT" (not to be confused with "green-eyed taxi", this is another technology), as you know, is gaining popularity all over the world.  In particular, the EU plans to raise the maximum temperature for data centers from 35¬∫ to 45¬∫. <br><br>  Fans of technical characteristics - as they say, I have them: <br><br><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td>  OS </td><td>  Microsoft Windows Storage Server 2008 R2 Enterprise Edition </td></tr><tr><td>  File Access Protocols </td><td>  CIFS, NFS, FTP </td></tr><tr><td>  Block Data Access Protocols </td><td>  Microsoft iSCSI Target </td></tr><tr><td>  Form factor </td><td>  1U rackmount </td></tr><tr><td>  Number of processors </td><td>  1-2 </td></tr><tr><td>  Processors </td><td>  - 1 x Intel Xeon E5-2609 with a frequency of 2.40 GHz, 10MB cache <br>  - 2 x Intel Xeon E5-2640 with a frequency of 2.50 GHz, 15 MB cache <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Internal drives </td><td>  Each platform in a cluster configuration - 2 hard disks for OS (RAID 1) or 4 hard disks for OS (RAID 5) </td></tr><tr><td>  Maximum number of internal drives </td><td>  Up to four 2.5 "SAS drives </td></tr><tr><td>  Supported Hard Drives </td><td>  300GB 10K SAS 6G, 2.5 ‚Äù, hot-swappable </td></tr><tr><td>  Connecting external drives </td><td>  PowerVault MD, EqualLogic or Compellent arrays can be connected to the PowerVault NX3300 </td></tr><tr><td>  RAID Type </td><td>  Optional RAID 1 or RAID 5 (PERCH310) Factory Installed Options </td></tr><tr><td>  Connectivity </td><td>  Options of the daughter network card 10GbE with an RJ45 NDC adapter, 4x1 Gb (Value configurations and 1Gb Performance) or 2x10 Gb (10Gb Performance configuration).

Therefore, we offer to meet with another newcomer - <b>Dell PowerVault NX3200</b> . <br><br>  This high density network system is designed to exchange both file and block-type data and supports internal storage systems up to 36 TB using 12 disks in a compact 2U package. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fad/69c/c2a/fad69cc2a914ecdd24ab544305d557d5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  If, for some reason, 36 TB is not enough (and we remember how much RAM is ‚Äúenough for everyone‚Äù), you can increase the capacity with the help of external arrays of Dell PowerVault MD1200 and MD1220. <br><br>  All file sharing resources are combined to allow users of different platforms to collaborate using the network file system NFS.  When NFS is used, storage reliability is replicated across the Distributed File System (DFS), using the Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) to create backup copies for them, and the File Services Resource Manager (FSRM) monitors and generates reports. <br><br>  Another advantage of the NX3200 is the ability to select 600 GB SAS drives or 3 TB Near-Line SAS drives.  As a matter of fact, Near-Line SAS is a SATA disk, in which all external electronics are made according to the SAS standard.  And this is not some kind of external snag that allows you to insert a regular SATA disk into the SAS system, but a full-fledged 2-port SAS electronics, which significantly increases the fault tolerance of the system disks in case of problems with one of the ports. <br><br>  In conclusion, we mention a couple of obvious things, which are meaningless to boast about, since any self-respecting manufacturer has long been obliged to take care of them.  It is about ease of use and speed of installation.  The PowerVault NX3200 package includes all the components that are needed to safely and efficiently exchange information without spending time, money and resources on deploying a file server from scratch (installation wizards, as well as an unlimited number of CAL licenses for additional customers).  In addition, the system can not only fully integrate into the Windows environment using the already deployed management and protection tools, but also store data of client computers using a different OS (Not Windows, ‚Äùsuggests a certain OO). <br><br>  As a "final chord" - technical characteristics: <br><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td>  OS </td><td>  Microsoft Windows Storage Server 2008 R2 Standard Edition </td></tr><tr><td>  File Access Protocols </td><td>  CIFS, NFS, FTP </td></tr><tr><td>  Block Data Access Protocols </td><td>  Microsoft iSCSI Target </td></tr><tr><td>  Form factor </td><td>  2U rackmount </td></tr><tr><td>  Number of processors </td><td>  1-2 </td></tr><tr><td>  Processors </td><td>  - 1 x Intel Xeon E5-2609 with a frequency of 2.40 GHz, 10 MB cache <br>  - 2 x Intel Xeon E5-2640 with a frequency of 2.50 GHz, 15 MB cache <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Internal drives </td><td>  2 hard drives, 2.5 ‚ÄùSAS for OS (RAID 1) and 12 hard drives </td></tr><tr><td>  Maximum number of internal drives </td><td>  Up to 12 drives - 3.5 "SAS drives, NL-SAS or SATA with a total capacity of 36 TB </td></tr><tr><td>  Supported Hard Drives </td><td>  3.5 ‚ÄùSAS drives, NL-SAS and SATA </td></tr><tr><td>  Connecting external drives </td><td>  Default is not supported.

The <b>Dell PowerVault NX3200</b> and <b>Dell PowerVault NX3300 solutions</b> are <b>designed</b> to securely centralize storage and data backup, thus avoiding additional costs in case of loss or inefficient data allocation and associated performance loss. <br><br>  <i>If you want to learn more about Dell PowerVault or you are interested in order conditions, you can write directly to Marat Rakayev at Dell: marat_rakaev@dell.com.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/151845/">https://habr.com/ru/post/151845/</a></p>
