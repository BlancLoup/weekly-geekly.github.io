Part 1</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  CorelCAD 2014 is an efficient, high-performance, and cost-effective CAD solution for everyday design work requiring precision and careful detailing. <br><br>  Businesses using CAD systems have always had a hard time choosing software.  Many applications, while meeting budget requirements, often lack the necessary tools or use formats that make collaboration and data sharing difficult.  CorelCAD 2014 makes it easy to choose: customers are offered a low-cost, full-featured application for two-dimensional computer-aided design with tools for modeling three-dimensional objects. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Working with CAD files is becoming commonplace for a wide range of graphic professionals - from technical illustrators to designers in marketing departments.  Thus, the ability of an application to open and reuse CAD materials such as .DWG files has become a necessity that saves the organization time and money. <br><br>  The native CorelCAD (.DWG) file format supports the latest AutoCAD DWG file format (R2013 .DWG used in AutoCAD 2013/2014), which guarantees full compliance with industry standards.  CorelCAD processes file attributes related to unsupported AutoCAD features, and retains all the functionality of the .DWG files, so there are no problems with file conversion and sharing.

      For those who are familiar with other popular CAD systems, the transition to CorelCAD 2014 will not cause difficulties.  CorelCAD includes a number of tools, commands, and interface elements present in other CAD software, so any CAD user will be able to get started quickly, without wasting time on training. <br><br>  Traditionally, the CAD system used the Windows operating system, but Mac also has its followers.  In light of this, CorelCAD is optimized for both platforms - and is offered at a significantly lower price than other CAD software for Mac. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e1f/22e/225/e1f22e22562a2d26a8abd71dfa201214.jpg"><br><br><h4>  User categories </h4><br><h5>  Architects, engineers and building service providers </h5><br>  In the field of architecture, design and construction, designers usually work with CAD in two-dimensional mode, but more attention is paid to three-dimensional design.  Designers work in small or medium-sized companies and create various images, including two-dimensional drawings, building plans, side projections, floor plans, and detailed diagrams.  Such projects with equal probability can be created from scratch or on the basis of existing components.  The ability to collaborate and share files with colleagues and customers plays a crucial role in the workflow of designers.  In addition, many architects prefer to use the Macintosh operating system or work in a mixed environment with Windows and Macintosh.  CorelCAD 2014 meets these needs, being an economical two-dimensional application that meets standards and supports modeling of three-dimensional objects.  The ability to work with the .DWG format, including AutoCAD 2014 .DWG files, eliminates the problem of converting formats when sharing files with colleagues or reusing existing files.  Collaboration is simplified and accelerated due to the support of voice notes and comments in editable drawings.  In addition, files can be exported to CorelDRAW (CDR) *, Corel DESIGNER (DES) * and PDF formats, which makes it easy to share information with other departments of the company, such as the documentation or marketing department.  In addition, CorelCAD 2014 is optimized for both Windows and Mac OS, so users can work on the platform they prefer. <br>  <i>* Only in Windows version.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/400/cf2/f8b/400cf2f8bb30c83058d7452d0011345f.gif"><br><br><h5>  Irregular users of two-dimensional CAD systems </h5><br><br>  There are two groups of irregular users of two-dimensional CAD systems, each with its own needs and workflows. <br>  First, they are designers working at large enterprises in the industrial sector. Although they mostly use three-dimensional CAD systems, they still need the support of a two-dimensional mode.  In particular, they are developing assembly diagrams and detail drawings, and many of the existing files that need to be saved are in 2D CAD format (.DWG).  A two-dimensional sketch often serves as the basis for a three-dimensional project, and designers need the ability to process three-dimensional files to add parts to two-dimensional drawings.  To transfer the results of their work to other departments, designers export CAD drawings to various formats. Secondly, they are graphic designers who need a tool for editing CAD files that supports all .DWG drawing elements, such as model spaces and mockups. Designers work in marketing and technical documentation departments, and the ability to work with two-dimensional CAD files allows them to reuse project materials in user guides, marketing materials and presentations  iyah. <br><br>  CorelCAD meets these needs, being an inexpensive two-dimensional application that meets standards and serves as an addition to three-dimensional CAD systems.  The ability to import drawings from CorelDRAW (CDR) and export CAD drawings to CorelDRAW and Corel DESIGNER * file formats makes it easy to use them for other purposes.  This means that users will be able to save and reuse existing materials. <br>  <i>* Only in Windows version.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/359/a6b/be9/359a6bbe9a7eaf1376044083a3771fd5.gif"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/206942/">https://habr.com/ru/post/206942/</a></p>
