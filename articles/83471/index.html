      In general, the very next day I was visited by an idea that turned out to be funny enough to share it with someone else ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So, if a kilogram of meat contains 50,000 liters.  water, is it possible to say that a unit of any product contains as much resources as is spent on its production? <br><br>  Let's take a look at your favorite vegetarian dish - Pic. <br><br>  Suppose one average Chinese grows 1 ton of rice per season.  During this time, it consumes 10 kg of rice and 300 liters of water.  Rice grows in a natural swamp and therefore we will not take into account the water in the swamp. <br><br>  Total for the production of 1 kg of rice you need to spend <b>10g of rice and 0.3 liters of water.</b> <br><br>  However, rice must also be taken to the city and sold.  A Chinese man does not want to do this himself and sells rice to dealers. <br><br>  Reseller in one day transports 1 ton of rice. <br><br>  During this day, the reseller eats 400 grams of rice, 200 grams of beef and 3 liters of water.  In addition, his car consumes 10 liters of gasoline for that day. <br><br>  Total for transportation of 1 kg of rice is necessary to spend <b>0.4 grams of rice, 0.2 grams of beef, 3 milliliters of water and 1 milliliter of gasoline.</b> <br><br>  Rice goes to the ‚ÄúCentral Rice Shop‚Äù, which sells for 100 kg per day.  The store seller, as a resident of the city, consumes a much larger ration of products per day: 200 grams of rice, 200 grams of beef, 3 liters of water, 200 grams of chicken, 2 eggs.  Also, once a week, the seller consumes alcohol in the amount of 2 bottles of beer and uses the services of a brothel. <br><br>  Total for the sale of 1 kg of rice you need to spend <b>2 grams of rice, 2 grams of beef, 3 milliliters of water, 2 grams of chicken, 0.02 eggs, 0.14 liters of beer, 0.14 sex.</b> <br><br>  To summarize?  1 kilogram of rice lying on the counter of the supermarket contains: <br><br>  <b>12.4 grams of rice / 2.2 grams of beef / 0.33 liters of water / 2 grams of chicken / 0.02 eggs / 0.14 liters of beer / 0.14 sex</b> <br><br>  In order for rice to get to our country, you need to feed logisticians, transport workers, state employees (hello taxes) and a lot of bribe takers and officials.  Feel free to increase the performance by 10 times. <br>  Now think: <br><br>  1) In 2008, 2828 thousand tons were imported to Russia from China.  rice.  In order to produce it all, China has spent resources: 55,290 cows / 2,073,720 liters of water / 2,090 hens / 125,680 eggs / 879,760 liters of fuel / 1,759,520 bottles of beer / (most interesting) 879,760 times sex. <br><br>  2) In order to feed the average vegetarian during the year, you need about 120 kg of rice.  And this is 2.64 kg of beef, 2.4 kg of chicken, 24 eggs, 168 times sex with a Chinese prostitute. <br><br>  3) This is only rice, but what is contained in products that are more difficult to manufacture? <br><br>  4) The average Russian office manager consumes more than it can produce. <br><br>  5) To feed one average family that consumes beef in the main diet, it is necessary to raise one cow per year. <br><br>  6) If you produce something, then everything that you consume in everyday life can be considered the resources necessary for the production of your product. <br><br>  7) The year of work of a programmer (such as I) costs the planet allegedly at ~ 30 kg of beef, ~ 8 hens, ~ 60 kg of rice. <br><br>  Bonus: <br><br>  It would be fun if in the near future some IT company declared its products to be environmentally friendly, stating that the programmers involved in their development consumed while writing code only environmentally friendly products grown without harm to tropical forests. <br><br>  For me, all these conclusions can serve as not bad food for the mind. <br><br>  PS: Some of the data was taken from open sources, the other half were thought out and invented, from which the essence was not lost. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/83471/">https://habr.com/ru/post/83471/</a></p>
