Arriving in Moscow, the triumph, all that jazz.  It takes only a couple of weeks as the licensing policy of the Ministry of Communications makes VimpelCom completely uncompetitive, it is a matter of time when it leaves the market.

      And by the will of fate.  It has been quite a while.  Somewhere in late summer, already in 1998, I break into the White House to First Deputy Prime Minister Boris Efimovich Nemtsov.  "To the first deputy prime minister," my knees tremble!  You come in ... very nicely talked, I remembered to him this little article - he actually blossomed.  I told him how the company ... well, unequal conditions in the market, help!  He said, ‚ÄúAh, and this one is here ...‚Äù It doesn't matter who.  And in the end, after some time, a decision signed by Nemtsov and Marder, Deputy Minister of Communications, comes to equate ... and then not completely, issue a license to VimpelCom.  Company saved!  If it were not for this, it would not exist. <br><br>  I have a book called ‚ÄúFrom 2 to 72‚Äù, that is, it is already 10 years old.  There are photos and words about this case: <br>  Friends!  Anyone who loves Beeline, VimpelCom, put a portrait of Nemtsov and Marder, pray for them.  If not for them, the company would not exist.  But then, however, it was not so simple. <br><br>  <a href="http://tvrain.ru/articles/zhanna_nemtsova_otets_nikogda_vserez_ne_schital_chto_ego_mogut_ubit_a_takzhe_boris_zimin_i_igor_svinarenko_o_borise_nemtsove-385299/">Interview with Dmitry Zimin TV channel "Rain"</a> . </blockquote><br>  In the same interview, Dmitry Borisovich expressed concern about what was happening: ‚ÄúWe all see that there are elements in our country, very obvious elements of savagery.  &lt;...&gt; Nemtsov‚Äôs bright image is not only the memory of Nemtsov.  This, if you will, is a struggle with the savagery that is going on in the country. ‚Äù <br><br>  Dmitry Borisovich described the situation in the late 1990s around Beeline in more detail in his book ‚ÄúFrom 2 to 72 or the Picture Book,‚Äù he also recalled Nemtsov and Marder.  The book was published in 2007. <br><br><img width="300" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9f9/1ec/d03/9f91ecd030a94e988b8deebf7cf8ebc8.png"><br>  <sup>‚ÄúI found a photograph of Boris Nemtsov in my archive among the documents devoted to Wednesdays Beeline.</sup>  <sup>This is how the top management of VimpelCom met with representatives of the Russian elite, which began to be held about a year after the events described, in the autumn of 1999. ‚Äù</sup> <br><br><blockquote> November 22, 1996.  A date that for two long years was circled in black on my calendar. <br> <a href="http://https:"><img width="300" align="right" src="//habrastorage.org/files/7d5/d72/fb4/7d5d72fb47bc48f7b854a0765769702c.jpg"></a> <br>  Rosico, which, like MTS, belongs to Sistema, received a license for DCS-1800 for five regions of Russia, including Moscow and St. Petersburg.  This is equivalent to giving VimpelCom a notice of his imminent demise.  Our competition with MTS + Rosiko becomes unpromising.  Without notification, the previously adopted concept of ‚Äúone standard - one operator‚Äù has been violated.  We and our shareholders are deceived.  But only just finished the stock market celebrations ... <br><br>  Continuing from despair to build a network of 1800, we begin the struggle for the GSM-900 license.  This becomes our only chance to save the company. <br><br>  I miss almost two years.  No strength to even remember. <br><br>  During these two years, Bulgak from the Minister of Communications turned into a vice-premier, even visited us as a guest in the GSM center (so far only GSM-1800) at Krasnoselskaya, and we are not given licenses. <br><br>  This is despite the long-standing decision of the Ministry of Communications that if in any region in the hands of one operator there is access to two GSM standard bands, then its competitor, operating only in GSM ‚Äì 1800, has the right to demand access to GSM ‚Äì 900.  If there are frequencies ... <br><br>  Together with the military we conduct large-scale studies of the state and prospects for using the frequency range.  We show the possibility of allocating frequencies for another operator ... And licenses are not given. <br><br>  Governments changed, Bulgak stopped supervising communication, Kiriyenko became prime minister, and the connection is now supervised by Nemtsov ... <br><br>  And here finally ... There is still a god in heaven and justice on earth ... <br><br>  In early August 1998, a decision was made to issue supplements to our licenses, which allow the provision of cellular services of the GSM-900/1800 dual-band network.  Not for nothing.  We are obliged to pay $ 30 million to the Russian Space Agency as a budget fee for the use of radio frequency assignments. <br><br>  Under the decision the signatures page is ‚Äúagreed‚Äù.  There are autographs of the leaders of the Ministry of Defense and the structures of the State Committee for Communication related to the regulation of the use of the frequency resource.  But decisive and decisive was the signature of the Deputy Chairman of the State Committee on Communications (the Ministry of Communications was then called) N.S.  Marder and the approving signature of the Deputy Chairman of the Government B.E.  Nemtsov. <br><br>  August 11, 1998 additions to licenses on beautiful secure forms in our hands.  By the way, as far as I know, nobody has ever paid such money for frequencies before us.  But now is not to petty calculations. <br><br>  Anyone who cares about VimpelCom! <br>  Get the portraits of Marder and Nemtsov and offer them prayers of praise.  If not for them, VimpelCom would not exist.  And in general, if the ‚ÄúBee Line‚Äù temple is ever created, I will tell you from whose parsuns you can form an iconostasis.  They will not be so little.  Well, and sins ... Who does not have them ... <br><br>  Dmitry Zimin.  ‚ÄúFrom 2 to 72 or a picture book‚Äù ( <a href="">PDF</a> / <a href="http://www.dynastyfdn.com/zimin/book">PDF by chapters</a> / <a href="http://www.mos-time.ru/zimin_add/book-zimin.html">online</a> ), 2007. </blockquote><br><br> <a href="http://tvrain.ru/articles/fotoreportazh_minuta_nemolchanija_v_moskve-385269/"><img width="450" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8ef/a36/9e7/8efa369e737d4a8ab669a0da916c9498.jpg"></a> <br>  <sub>Bolshoy Moskvoretsky Bridge, April 7, 2015.</sub> <br><br>  Bright memory.  It is still impossible to believe. <br><br>  UPD: <br>  It would be great if the staff of Beeline on Habrahabr and GT again after some time tell (more from a technological point of view, for example, why the usual GSM-900/1800 for everyone was first strictly separated and how it was in other countries) about this important chapter in the history of the development of mobile communications in Russia in addition to the information that is available to us thanks to the book of D.Zimin.  I think that it would be interesting to readers. <br><br>  <sub>* Please inform by letter about possible errors in decoding the interview.</sub> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/366753/">https://habr.com/ru/post/366753/</a></p>
