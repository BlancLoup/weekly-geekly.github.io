  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Review Yota Many</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In early June, the company Yota introduced two new devices to work in their network, <b>Yota One</b> and <b>Yota Many</b> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/yota/blog/120954/">read more</a> about which you can on our website.  For today I prepared the review of the "senior" novelty - welcome under kat. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7b6/743/9dd/7b67439dd251ae1a3f45b132a783d511.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In fact, Yota Many is just a mobile access point that distributes the Internet via Wi-Fi.  Almost exactly the same as it did Yota Egg, which I already <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/72002/">wrote about</a> .  But this is where all her charm lies - turned it on, put it in a backpack, and you have fast internet wherever you go or go.  But there is a novelty and a difference - so significant that I switched to it without the slightest hesitation.

If during the time of Yota Egg I had to remove the device in the glove box of the car (and in it I often need an Internet), now the device can be fixed anywhere - for example, on a torpedo (for better reception).  Similarly, in the office, the device can be stuck on the window - this is all, of course, ridiculous, but often this life hack gives a significant increase in connection speed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2a2/54b/e7d/2a254be7d88a210696bd85f3d00303c5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The device is as simple as possible, but despite this, it received a rather unique design - at least I don‚Äôt know with what it could be confused.  Or compare.  A smaller pack of cigarettes and less phone ... but at the same time thicker than a credit card.  However, what's the difference - the main thing is that less than it was before.  Perceptibly smaller and lighter. <br><br>  Compared to HTC Sensation: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6d2/8cd/072/6d28cd0720c819d5353fab04ad7e8465.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/58f/976/0aa/58f9760aa17564a12a5140d29e78d9ff.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Yota Many is made entirely of matte plastic in the color of ‚Äúwet asphalt‚Äù - there are no complaints about the assembly (by the way, there is only one solid body).  From above - the company logo in the form of an inverted man (by the way, his name is <b>Nuf</b> - from the "inverted" word <b>Fun</b> ). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d4c/663/f4f/d4c663f4f76c9cee661e411db84d5257.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  From one end is the power button and switch to share the network. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3f7/70f/fca/3f770ffca85beac72398f2b592176ee8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the other hand - the microUSB connector (for connecting via wire). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e8e/af0/5e3/e8eaf05e3d7cf2b3d5297fa9f110bbf2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  With a flick of the wrist, the same connector turns into ... turns into ... rotate ... into an elegant USB connector! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bc5/70e/3de/bc570e3deffe314cd26d99327aa17cd1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Under the USB-connector is a sticker with useful information - the serial number of the device and the MAC-address. <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  The device is fully developed in Russia by Yota specialists and assembled in China by the Quanta Group.  Suppliers of the main components: Wi-Fi chip - Atheros, WiMAX chip - GCT.  Inside there is an antenna (2-3 dBi) and an amplifier (23 dBm). </td></tr></tbody></table>  Nowhere does the company name appear anywhere - I respect when manufacturers do not abuse it. <br><br><h2>  <font color="00aeef">Turn on and work</font> </h2><br>  If the device is located in the Yota network zone, then Fun will light up with an unobtrusive blue light.  It is a pity that this glow can not be turned off.  At the same time, white ‚Äúdots‚Äù appear on one of the sides, signaling the battery charge level - extremely convenient and much more informative than in the Yota Egg (where the tri-color LED was just - before leaving for the conference it could be green, and after 5 minutes - orange. So I was left without a couple of times, considering that the battery life of the ‚Äúegg‚Äù is only 5-6 hours) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/14a/0f8/c14/14a0f8c141d90485b403183a6474f37d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As I said above, under the USB-connector is a sticker with the MAC address of the device.  The last three characters of this address are part of the network name that the Many device creates around itself (that is, if the mac address ends with " <b>F73</b> ", then the personal network will be called " <b>Yota F73</b> "). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/af9/68f/685/af968f685742b0619a66572e6866875d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Moreover, this address is a password for connecting to the network - another plus, since the password is complex and unique.  For comparison - in addition, the ‚Äúeggs‚Äù could easily enter the admin area if the admin login and password were not changed;  <s>here there is simply no</s> admin there - read below) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6de/1c1/227/6de1c12274b8397a51a81d120f9955a6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  What is the chip switch located on the end of the device?  If earlier (in the case of Yota Egg), you had to protect your network with a password (and, accordingly, tell this password to your friends), now everything has become easier.  If ‚Äúoff‚Äù - only you use the Internet, if enabled (the smile will be visible), another ‚Äú <b>Yota Share</b> ‚Äù network will appear, to which up to 8 more people can connect.  And without a password.  Conveniently! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/eea/d28/370/eead283706c8891cfa0a371f54b2ad9f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And friendly :) <br><br>  I didn‚Äôt spend accurate measurements of battery life, but this time is definitely longer than a working day.  If you believe the manufacturer, then in the mode of distribution Wi-Fi device works up to 24 hours, and in the mode of intensive data transfer - about 10 hours.  Anyway great.  Full charge time - 2.5 hours, and if you charge from the USB-port and at the same time use the device, then 4 hours. <br><br>  I like the speed - living in the center and in the South-Eastern Administrative Okrug, easily it turns out to watch streaming video, listen to music from the network, receive-send mail, use twitter and other instagrams. <br><br><h2>  <font color="00aeef">Yota Many vs.</font>  <font color="00aeef">Yota egg</font> </h2><br>  At the moment, Yota Egg has no advantages as such - almost everything in it is multiplied in Yota Many.  But one significant difference is still there - at Egg, at 192.168.1.1, there is an admin panel in which you can set the network name, password, and do port forwarding.  In Many, you will have to be content with the network name that the manufacturer will supply you with, the password will also have to be remembered.  On the other hand, you only need to know the password in Many, since the network shared by pressing a button is open. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0c5/43f/329/0c543f3290bfbf17e6d7538133c7538e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Well, in detail.  Yota Egg has more dimensions and weight, only 5-6 hours of battery life, a not very informative indicator of battery charge and a non-standard power connector.  In Many - comfortable for everyday use dimensions, a day of battery life, the ability to use a finger to treat your friends with the Internet, as well as the ability to work directly from USB.  Moreover, the device can be plugged into the USB-connector of the same laptop, and connected via a wire with microUSB. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cc5/586/570/cc558657055ba8f2e7da57204a07dbde.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  If you disassemble the Egg, then it turns out that <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/WiMAX/118321/">there are</a> several connectors for connecting external antennas <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/WiMAX/118321/">inside</a> - perhaps something similar is provided for in Many, but I don‚Äôt want to poke around in it, since everything initially works without complaints.  Yes, and the body, apparently non-separable. <br><br><h2><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/af2/94a/228/af294a2281f2c106ec7aac2f877a8602.png" alt="image">  <font color="00aeef">Advantages and disadvantages</font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Compact housing made of quality material <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  The possibility of mounting the device on the suction cup <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  3 connection options (USB, microUSB, Wi-Fi) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Long battery life (up to 24 hours) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Informative battery charge indicator <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  The ability to "share" the connection with a single click <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Cross-platform - no need to install any software <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  The glowing logo can not be turned off, and he eats too <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  Expensive <br><br>  4900 rubles are written on the official price tag of the device.

I liked the battery life most of all - if I use the device for several hours every day (on the way to and from work), I have only one charge for a week.  If, however, to use more actively, the time is an "honest" day, that is, 4-5 times more than what Yota Egg was capable of.  And all this despite the fact that the novelty turned out to be much more compact. <br><br>  Another question is the price of the Internet itself from the provider, as well as the coverage area (do not forget about the ‚Äú <a href="http://www.yota.ru/ru/actions/try/week/">Week to try</a> ‚Äù action that applies to this device).  This is a topic for a separate article, now I don‚Äôt want to argue on this point, but for myself I decided a long time ago :) <br><br><h2>  <font color="000000">*</font> <font color="cc0000">UPD</font> <font color="000000">:</font> </h2><br>  I repent - I did not read the manual) It turns out that the device still has an ‚Äúadmin‚Äù - you need to go to <a href="http://status.yota.ru/">status.yota.ru</a> - you can change the password in the same place, redirect ports. <br><br>  uPnP is.  WPA TKIP and AES supported.  You can connect from multiple devices to a secure network.  USB is needed to charge the device and connect to Yota without using WiFi - so yes, this is a killer feature Many - supports Category 4 WiMAX - up to 20Mbit, Egg - Category 3 (12 Mbit). <br><br><h2>  <font color="000000">*</font> <font color="cc0000">UPD2</font> <font color="000000">:</font> </h2><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/WiMAX/123055/">Device Setup</a> (admin) |  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/WiMAX/122768/">We disassemble the device</a> , we put external antennas <br><br>  <b>Successes!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/122614/">https://habr.com/ru/post/122614/</a></p>
