That very night, when one French football player very much wanted his team to go to South Africa.  It was a deal with the devil.  But it's not about that ... <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0d4/d38/1a7/0d4d381a751a795623fc9660553a78f6.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The world community fubel regularly and with enviable periodicity insists on the use of video replay system during a football match.  But not everyone understands how much the game itself can change from the way in which these same video replays will finally be introduced.  And in no case should not adopt this high-tech experience from other sports.  Rugby?  Schmegby?  Anything?!  STOP, Lord!  This is football.  This is the king of sport.  And with the king - only royally. <br><br>  Imagine for a moment the year 2020.  Imagine Football 2020. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  FIFA was honored to introduce a video replay system, but did everything so that this step did not turn the game of millions into a Klondike to earn advertising money.  FIFA has done everything to preserve the entertainment of this sport.  To preserve the intrigue of every second of those most conservative "two forty-five."  Football referee - is still the main on the field.  And his highly professional decisions are <b>not</b> dictated by high-tech assistants.  However, there are video replays.  But this is not at all what we ‚Äúdreamed‚Äù of at zero ... <br><br>  So let's go.  The technical side of the question: Imagine an iPhone sample of 2020.  Such an outrageously thin and dumb-witted smart device - a crown of engineering thought.  By happy coincidence (!), Which exactly repeats the geometry (d √ó h √ó w) of the present red and yellow cards, but combines a multisensory digital panel and a computer.

      And now, a football match.  Game, gross violation of the rules, whistle;  the judge runs to the scene of the event and pulls out a familiar card from his pocket, only she is semi-transparent.  From touching the fingers of the referee's hand, this thing is activated and the approximate task bar (menu) appears before the judge: - Yellow card (warning) - Red card (deletion) - Scoring (Goal) - Player replacement - Video replay - ... - Profit <br><br>  In our case, the judge confidently pointed to the point and the card shone red for the offender.  But the captain of the offending team asked the judge to view the episode in violation.  Delov something!  A couple of clicks into the device and now the referee chooses a convenient angle of view and frame depth on a small screen.  No need to run to the curb, stop the match - everything happens on the fly.  And the sheep are safe and wolves, as they say ... <br><br>  Probably the gadget itself includes the following components and third-party nodes: - multi-touch display of the light-conducting material - 100% of the surface;  a processor (third-party device at the stadium) of instant construction and processing of a 3D terrain model within a radius of 200 meters (approximately the stadium);  memory, battery (something else there), wireless communication with devices (for example, with a whistle, a ball or a clock referee);  the similarity of a gyroscope - to accurately determine this card in space relative to the field, the players, the judge - so as he didn‚Äôt take this card and turn it, display activity was facing him. <br>  ... <br>  Let's go back to our beloved 2010. <br>  The situation in football is controversial, ambiguous.  However, modern technologies are already able to change the game of millions.  And change it for the better.  Only approach these changes need to head.  With a sober look and a cold mind.  And, most importantly, these changes should occur gradually.  Step by step if you want.  Football would not be the most popular game in the world, if the rules of the game changed like gloves. <br><br>  In short, you need to think ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/97647/">https://habr.com/ru/post/97647/</a></p>
