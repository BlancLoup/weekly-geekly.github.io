  <section class="page js-page"><h1>QIWI Plastic for you - on special conditions</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Dear residents of Habr, thank you for visiting our blog for the details of a <a href="http://ad.adriver.ru/cgi-bin/click.cgi%3Fsid%3D1%26ad%3D409589%26bt%3D21%26bid%3D2714969%26bn%3D2714969%26rnd%3D99660211">special promotion</a> .  We designed it for you, because we want to present you our QIWI Plastic card (since July it is being distributed in a new black design).  You can issue a card for free.  To do this, go to the promotions page (link above) and get a promo code there. <br><br>  And now we want to tell you on simple life examples where and how QIWI Plastic can be useful to you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ac8/4eb/cc0/ac84ebcc0b13ae372c92ba8a1264e56f.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>The first example is QIWI Plastic for freelancing.</b>  Conveniently, because you can get a fee for your projects for it, and this method will suit any customer.  Even to the one who never used electronic money. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      <br>
      Freelancers will understand me: the situation often happens completely stupid.  You discuss with the customer the method of settlement, but the customer‚Äôs inexperience in electronic payments becomes a stumbling block.  In this case, QIWI Plastic will make life easier for both parties.  To transfer you money, it is enough to know your mobile number.  Neither the account number, nor the card number is needed - not a single long number in which you can get confused or mistaken. <br><br>  Money is transferred instantly and without commission.  Agree, it is nice to immediately receive your fee as soon as the customer has sent it, and not to wait a few days.  Yes, and you will not have to decide with the customer an unpleasant question, on which side the commission costs will remain. <br><br>  <b>The second example is travel.</b>  What does QIWI Plastic do with it?  Very simple.  If you need additional funds, your friends and family can transfer money directly to the card instantly and without commission using any QIWI Terminal, mobile app or <a href="http://visa.qiwi.com/">on the Visa QIWI Wallet website</a> . <br><br>  <b>The third example is a family card.</b>  This case appeared due to the fact that you can tie not 1 but 2, 3 or more cards to one QIWI Wallet.  Then everything is simple: one card is with you, and the second is with the child.  Both are tied to your QIWI Wallet.  In the "Reports" section you can see all the operations performed on both cards.  As a result, your child has pocket money, and you - confidence in the proper spending of funds.  You can get a separate card for any family member in case of unforeseen expenses. <br>  You will instantly receive information on all purchases made on any of the cards linked to your QIWI Wallet: free SMS notification and information in the ‚ÄúReports‚Äù section.  Any card you can instantly block. <br><br>  <b>And in conclusion, we want to draw your attention to the security of payments.</b>  Why do we recommend QIWI Plastic for daily payments? <br><br>  On the QIWI Plastic card, the account of which is combined with the QIWI Wallet, it is convenient to keep a small amount for current and online purchases.  Such a card can be paid off in any places and on any sites: your risks are strictly limited to the amount of money in your QIWI Wallet, and the card itself in case of force majeure can be blocked and re-issued with new details.  The main thing is that you do not jeopardize your main accounts. <br><br>  About each payment you receive a free SMS notification.  Information about all purchases on the card is reflected in your QIWI Wallet in the ‚ÄúReports‚Äù section.  You can block a card instantly using the SMS command ‚ÄúQVP STOP‚Äù to the number 7494 or in the QIWI Wallet in the ‚ÄúMy Cards‚Äù section.  With the help of SMS, you block at once all the cards attached to your QIWI Wallet.  And on the website <a href="http://visa.qiwi.com/">visa.qiwi.com</a> you can block cards separately. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/185022/">https://habr.com/ru/post/185022/</a></p>
