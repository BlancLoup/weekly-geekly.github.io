A new direction for the company allowed it to diversify its business and start offering complete integrated IT solutions.  This is also facilitated by an OEM agreement with EMC for the production of storage systems.  And the 2014 IBM x86 server business transaction completed was an important milestone in its history.  This agreement covers System X servers, BladeCenter blades and Flex System switches, as well as x86 integrated systems Flex, NeXtScale servers and iDataPlex related software.  This line has added Lenovo's own servers.  Now they are integrated into the ThinkServer line, where single- and dual-processor systems of the primary and secondary levels are presented so far. <br><br> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/lenovo/blog/255405/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cb2/5c9/2d8/cb25c92d83884c67a3bd5e6ba61fab66.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The Lenovo Thinker Server line, updated last fall, is positioned by the vendor as simple, easy-to-use and reliable systems on Intel Xeon E5-2600 V3 processors that are easily integrated into the multi-vendor IT infrastructure and represent an interesting alternative to the server platforms of the main competitors - HP, Dell and Fujitsu, for example new Dell PowerEdge R730 servers or HP Gen9 servers, including the ProLiant DL360 and DL380.  They do not use any proprietary protocols and are based on open interfaces and the latest components, which allows them to be used with solutions from other vendors. <br><br>  Features of new models - higher performance per watt, support for low-voltage components, integrated remote control, improved remote diagnostics and control, improved control module, multi-level storage (hybrid configuration ‚Äî 2.5 and 3.5-inch drive bays), modular design, increased number of PCIe Gen3 slots, rich I / O, high energy efficiency, support for internal SSD drives of the M.2 form factor.

      It must be admitted that the company pays close attention to the design of its servers, tries to optimize it, listening to the wishes of users.  Lenovo systems are characterized by practical design and ease of use.  And this concerns not only the servers inherited from IBM.  For example, owners of Lenovo monoblocks know how much better and sleeker these desktop PCs have become in the last five years - inside and out. <br><br>  But back to the servers.  New items include three models: <br><br>  <b><a href="http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/servers/thinkserver/racks/rd550/">Lenovo ThinkServer RD550</a></b> is a 1U rack server with a configuration of up to 12 disk drives with a total capacity of up to 26 TB, up to 8 ports of 10GbE and, optionally, four ports of 10GbE and two Fiber Channel ports of 16 Gbps. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/servers/thinkserver/racks/rd650/">Lenovo ThinkServer RD650</a></b> is a 2U rack server that holds up to 26 drives with a total capacity of up to 74 TB.  Both servers contain up to 768 GB of DDR4 RAM. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/servers/thinkserver/towers/td350/">Lenovo ThinkServer TD350</a></b> is a scalable server in an outdoor package.  He has on board - up to two new Intel processors, up to 512 GB of DDR4 memory and a storage subsystem with an impressive capacity of up to 90 TB. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Equipment</font> </h2><br>  The Lenovo ThinkServer RD650 server in its original packaging is three cardboard boxes: the server itself, rack rails, and power cables. <br><br>  The servers are assembled in Hungary and are supplied from stock with standard software and hardware options, or they are completed to order in Hungary.  Hardware options involve the choice of model and number of processors (up to two), RAM capacity, a combination of HDD and SSD, network cards, RAID controllers and HBA, mini-SAS cables for connecting additional disk shelves (DAS). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f4e/ad4/2c9/f4ead42c97dc4603b01c64954baa880f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6b1/4fc/ac2/6b14fcac2ff3489e9d8527fd983232df.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/85e/954/c46/85e954c4655541459e9cee80f3fc1628.jpg"><br><br>  And here is the RD650 itself, extracted from the box.  The designers did a good job on the design of this solution: both external and internal (as we will see later), it turned out to be very succinct, no frills. <br><br>  To access the main components of the server does not require any tools.  They do not need to mount the server in the rack: the case fixes a rack lock. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6eb/7c0/9da/6eb7c09dac224d7e9470462f40226924.jpg"><br><br>  All servers are equipped with guides for rack installation.  Optionally in a set there can be a bar for fastening of cables.  It allows you to push the server out of the rack without disrupting communication and power.  And of course, the manufacturer attaches instructions for assembling this farm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/25b/b19/a12/25bb19a12bc343d3b6dc3f2659e41109.jpg"><br><br>  Installing and pulling the server out of the rack must be done carefully.  It weighs 16 kg.  And with a full stuffing of the case with 2U discs, the weight load will noticeably increase: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f8f/4ab/7f5/f8f4ab7f5db6415cb9be913e141479ab.jpg"><br><br>  Documentation is traditionally supplied on a CD.  The document in the box contains information about ThinkServer System Manager Premium (described below for this component), as well as service and support.  Power cable is nothing out of the ordinary.  Withstand 1600 W - the maximum nominal value of a single power supply. <br><br>  Components that can be replaced in hot mode are highlighted in color so as to unknowingly not to cut down the server during operation.  On the case it is written that the assembly is really Hungarian: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/832/f79/360/832f79360c8d4db9ac8108ac6de43442.jpg"><br><br>  This standard mechanism allows you to remove the housing cover: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c93/ac3/7a5/c93ac37a5414454eb3d3730392c9148a.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Appearance</font> </h2><br>  Let's take a closer look at what a Lenovo ThinkServer RD650 server is, what its stuffing is, and what the design features are.  RD650 - rack servers that allow compact enough to place components inside the case.  The devices are equipped with Intel Xeon E5-2600 v3 processors with 18 cores in each and support up to 768 GB of DDR4 RAM, provide up to 50% increase in throughput and up to 50% energy efficiency compared to the previous version of DDR3 memory. <br><br>  Lenovo ThinkServer RD650 server stands out among its competitors: it has an individual architecture that provides high performance on the cost of ownership, which makes it quite competitive in solutions for the corporate sector in its segment.  The RD650 is a server for tasks requiring serious performance.  The server can be used as a platform for virtualization and databases, business applications, to build computing clusters and analytics systems from them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c87/314/c1d/c87314c1d77c40dc93c32eca8ffde5c0.jpg"><br><br>  The internal design of the server solution Lenovo ThinkServer RD650 is designed to maximize cooling during operation.  This architecture allows the use of the ‚Äúhottest‚Äù versions of Intel Xeon E5-2600 v3. <br><br>  An important difference of the RD650 from the previous model and competitors' servers, which gives it additional flexibility, is <b>Lenovo AnyFabric</b> , <b>AnyBay</b> and <b>AnyRAID technologies</b> .  The AnyRAID architecture makes it possible to expand the system by adding RAID controllers without taking up PCIe slots;  AnyFabric provides I / O scaling without the use of PCIe slots, and AnyBay supports various SATA / SAS and PCIe interfaces. <br><br>  The Lenovo AnyBay architecture (this is the four bays on the right) allows you to install different types of drives in one drive bay - SATA / SAS HDD, SATA / SAS SSD or PCIe SSD.  The flat front panel does not obstruct the view, the ventilation grilles provide free air flow into the case. <br><br>  At the top of the case, to the left of the ThinkServer inscription, we see the status panel, the power button, the ID button, a removable information card with the model number and the serial number: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1af/f71/d5d/1aff71d5dc80492ab24e7be3e3cae4b0.jpg"><br><br>  The modular design of the server allows you to select different configuration options - with 2.5 and / or 3.5 inch drives.  The RD650 server allows you to place nine 3.5-inch and six 2.5-inch disks in the front compartments, as well as two 2.5-inch disks in the rear compartments (optional).  This is a good option for multi-level data storage. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d5e/c7a/4b3/d5ec7a4b341b4d7e92ecf500cbcc3164.jpg"><br>  <i>This is how it looks alive.</i>  <i>Our option is at the top left.</i> <br><br>  The drive is easily removed from the case: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/166/853/fe0/166853fe0f6c43b99bc0c2a4a0e3361e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9ae/231/3a8/9ae2313a834444a99b21db3fb610b8c1.jpg"><br><br>  This is what the AnyBay reception part looks like in the case: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1f3/cbb/b3c/1f3cbbb3c67a4d03b608c5ee686e96eb.jpg"><br><br>  On the disk drive bays, the type and capacity of the HDD are indicated, and the LED indicator shows the operating status of the disk.  These drives are also easily removed - no tools needed.  Only skilled hands :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d70/32a/6b7/d7032a6b759d44fa9417b5cf4db3d178.jpg"><br><br>  In our server in these compartments are HDD SATA with a capacity of 2 TB: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9e4/c0e/ddc/9e4c0eddc0eb4594ace8c9b2164cf632.jpg"><br><br>  A red label indicates that the drive can be replaced hot. <br><br>  A special U-shaped punching profile and double walls of HDD compartments increase the strength and stability of the chassis.  HDD tray is equipped with inserts of high-temperature polyurethane to reduce vibration during operation or transportation. <br><br>  An important feature of the system is extensibility.  You can install various interface cards into the server without using PCIe system slots.  There is a large selection of options. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fc3/ab2/625/fc3ab262569a44dea2097f5e31b37551.jpg" align="left">  The possibilities of expanding the disk subsystem of the RD650 also attract attention - different options are also possible here.  When installing HDD with a capacity of 6 TB, the total capacity of the RD650 disk subsystem reaches 74 TB. <br><br>  In the server, you can install 12 3.5-inch disks at the front + two 2.5 "at the back or 24 disks at 2.5" at the front and two 2.5 "disks at the rear.  HDD and SSD are replaced in hot mode. <br><br>  The RD650 has 26 hard drive bays and 74 TB of internal storage ‚Äî more than enough to run storage-critical applications, such as database management systems, analytical tools, and streaming video playback tools. <br><br>  Additional disk shelves SA120 allow you to increase your own server disk space by 96 disks (with 8 shelves).  They connect to the server's RAID controller using the SAS protocol. <br><br>  The ThinkServer SA120 disk shelf on the front contains SAS hard disks - 12 HDD 3.5 inches, as well as additional compartments for 4 x 2.5 inches solid-state drives for data caching, supports up to two I / O controllers.  There are various scenarios for its connection - cascade, dual-channel or high availability.  For example, 4x4 for reservation or 8 shelves for maximum capacity.  In the shelves can be installed drives SATA SSD for data caching. <br><br>  The 2U case of the server itself also allows you to combine different types of disks - fast and slow, for ‚Äúhot‚Äù and ‚Äúcold‚Äù data.  That is, it is possible to organize a multi-level storage system inside the server with automatic movement of data blocks between media of different performance and cost depending on the frequency of access to this data (tiering). <br><br>  The view of the back side, as with other servers, is the same: there are power supply units, USB 3.0 and Enternet ports, a serial port and DisplayPort.  Four Ethernet ports are noteworthy here.  This is nothing more than AnyFabric.  Thanks to the AnyFabric architecture, network cards, CNA and HBA adapters do not occupy PCIe slots.  The RD650 has up to four 10GbE ports.  They also do not occupy PCIe slots. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/121/d49/121/121d491216f44ec7bc60560f7f42809c.jpg"><br><br>  And here is the gigabit Ethernet port for server management.  To his left is the system indicator.  On the right is the bay for two optional disk drives.  Here he just closed the lid. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d92/c55/e8e/d92c55e8e0854ceca7d2b49f4c24fee7.jpg"><br><br>  Lenovo RD640 is equipped with two power supplies with redundancy (1 + 1) and hot swap.  Server power units (main and backup) have the following possible power options: <br><br>  - 550 W / 750 W / 1100 W / 1600 W (80 PLUS Platinum), 110 V - 240 V AC <br>  - 750 W (80 PLUS Titanium), 200 V - 240 V AC <br>  - 1600 W (80 PLUS Platinum), 200 V - 240 V AC <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/030/65e/2d4/03065e2d475144d7b1fb9ea7cae34cde.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b4c/540/fae/b4c540faea654cd8b35376c39d1d9ab1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9ae/737/976/9ae737976d9244729c5272149de07dd0.jpg"><br><br>  The back side of the server cover contains a lot of useful information.  Directory is not required: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8e7/f0d/615/8e7f0d615ec1497b9efe24fede7821a0.jpg"><br><br>  Under the lid - the most interesting. <br><br>  Fan unit.  They provide reliable operation of the server in difficult temperature conditions.  Each is easy to replace in case of failure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0c2/f38/f6c/0c2f38f6cd864d808ef5b6392dbcd9ee.jpg"><br><br>  A key feature of the new Lenovo servers is high energy efficiency.  The cooling system meets the high requirements, which undoubtedly makes it possible to place servers with high density, and not to be afraid for overheating.  All elements of the server, as well as the active cooling unit (fans) are available for installation without additional tools, which makes it possible to quickly replace (supported replacement in working condition).  The processors and RAM in the server are distributed in one line, immediately behind the cooling unit. <br><br>  Due to their design, servers can operate continuously at a temperature of 45 degrees Celsius and relative humidity up to 90% (ASHRAE A4 standard), which means a significant reduction in operating costs due to a decrease in the energy required for cooling.  The cost of cooling the data center may exceed the cost of powering the IT equipment itself.  One way to reduce cooling costs is to operate the data center at higher temperatures. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/94e/f76/5ea/94ef765eae9a4aa29e59b722d7563f9c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7f0/059/7ad/7f00597adbc04e8cb8a2bfbf84f0711d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/936/d9b/d70/936d9bd704044374be8a3edbc062666a.jpg"><br><br>  Fans, like many other components of the server, can be replaced in a hot mode, and their design performs the important task of absorbing vibration - just like the disk bays, the fan blocks are equipped with polyurethane gaskets.  Through the holes you can see the LED indicator of the fan.  Lights green - means the fan is healthy. <br><br>  AnyFabric adapter outside and inside.  It allows you to select a network factory and supports 4xGbE / 2x10GbE, 4x8GbE, or FC / 2x16 Gbit / s or AnyRAID. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6d0/9f2/f9d/6d09f2f9df6a413ebe12923c05630a9b.jpg"><br><br>  And this is AnyRAID: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bf0/c8e/b4a/bf0c8eb4a8de4386b6949b275ada05fc.jpg"><br><br>  The new design of Lenovo AnyFabric and AnyRAID provides for the presence of four 10 Gigabit Ethernet ports and a RAID adapter to choose from, without having to use a PCIe slot.  That is, Lenovo AnyFabric and AnyRAID means that the RD650 can be equipped with four 10GbE ports and a RAID adapter without using PCIe slots.  RAID controllers on LSI chips can be equipped with offline cache protection with a capacity of up to 4 GB.  The servers can use the controllers RAID 500 levels 0/1/10, RAID 700 0/1/5/10/6/50/60, RAID 710 0/1/5/10/6/50/60. <br><br>  All in full view.  Processor radiators and memory modules of the first and second processor: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bcb/5a6/c4a/bcb5a6c4a7674b2cbbd9e44078249fe5.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9c7/569/32f/9c756932f9d047e8a5b026e653c30120.jpg"><br><br>  According to the specification, the RD650 model contains up to two Intel Xeon E5-2600 V3 processors, 24xDIMM DDR4 RDIMM / LRDIMM (768 GB), 12x2.5 "or 4x3.5" + 2x2.5 "SATA / SAS / PCI HDD / SSD hot plug , AnyRAID, 2xPCIe (3.5 ") or 3xPCIe (2.5"), gigabit port for control, 2/1 AnyFabric (2.5 / 3.2 "), power supplies 2x550 / 750/1000/1600 W Platinum / Titanium hot plug.  Eight PCIe slots provide high bandwidth for scaling I / O operations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bfe/912/19d/bfe91219d60046dea8c56dbcc43c37ab.jpg"><br><br>  Processor radiators and memory strips are closed with a cooling jacket: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5a2/b0f/2a2/5a2b0f2a273b417aba1fb46878acd81c.jpg"><br><br>  The new servers use low-voltage DDR4 memory with a frequency of up to 2133 MHz and a voltage of 1.2 V instead of 1.5 V in DDR3.  DDR4 memory allowed a 50% increase in system bandwidth and energy efficiency compared to previous models (Lenovo data). <br><br>  Server reliability is enhanced through the use of ECC memory, hot-swappable hard drives, redundant power supplies and cooling. <br><br>  The RD650 is distinguished from the previous RD640 model by a next-generation processor, a large RAM capacity (DDR4) and internal storage, greater I / O performance and flexibility, and more power options. <br><br>  PCIe slots provide an opportunity to expand the system configuration: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dbf/e72/917/dbfe72917f7f4584a88d710e9d668895.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/651/a22/0c4/651a220c49044897af7e5f5e0d101023.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8df/cfd/22a/8dfcfd22a5594d32935e7993cc6e241c.jpg"><br><br>  New Lenovo servers provide another useful option - the M.2 connector for connecting M.2 solid-state drives (SSD) and SD-cards for secure loading or loading of the hypervisor.  Support for an internal M.2 flash drive and SD card reduces system boot time.  Previously, for example, a USB interface was used to boot VMware ESXi.  You can now connect two M.2 devices to the system board as a replacement for USB, which are actually consumer devices, or you can still use USB. <br><br>  M.2 SSD drives improve MTBF.  90% of server failures are problems with HDD or power supplies.  SSDs solve one of these problems.  And in any case, the power supply units are reserved and replaced in the hot mode - there are two of them in the case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/14b/175/e2e/14b175e2e85d4fc3bf6690940bb62838.jpg"><br><br>  So, thanks to the latest Intel Xeon processors, large memory and hard drives, a variety of chassis types, a wide selection of RAID controllers and I / O options, you can easily choose the RD650 configuration for mission-critical business applications. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Soft</font> </h2><br>  A detailed description of the software component of the server is a separate topic of more than one post, so we only briefly mention software solutions. <br><br>  Among the software options - MS Windows Server 2012 and VMware vSphere 5. This software can be supplied already pre-installed or as a distribution.  The tools supplied with the server allow you to manage power consumption and plan power usage.  Each server offers Lenovo software: Rack Planner (power and cooling), EasyStartup and EasyUpdate initial configuration and upgrade applications, EasyManage and SmartGrid server infrastructure management client applications.  An integrated control controller provides remote control via a command line or GUI interface.  Servers support open standards and protocols IPMI 2.o, DCMI 1, o, SMASH-CLP, WS-MAN, IPMI Traps, SNMP Traps, CIM, IPMI System Event Log (SEL), etc. <br><br>  A set of new convenient management tools allows you to use the full potential of ThinkServer systems throughout their life cycle.  The tools have been completely redesigned for new generation ThinkServer systems, which increases productivity, reduces operating costs and total cost of ownership.  Tools include configuration, deployment, power management, and energy planning.
