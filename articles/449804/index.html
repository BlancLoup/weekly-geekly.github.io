  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Overview of anti-aging therapy for biohackers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  Anti-aging medicine is about 20 years old and the fathers of the founders of this new approach to medicine are all alive and well.  They are based mainly in the USA, and the first of them is Robert Goldman (MD, a specialist in sports medicine, is the founder of the National Commission of Sports Medicine of the USA, co-founder of the American Academy of Anti-Aging, endocrinologist, professor, has a degree in surgery, has written 40 books on sports and anti-aging medicine) said that with modern knowledge in the field of endocrinology it is possible to separate the biological age and the calendar age safely.  The second is the famous founder of growth hormone therapy, Ronald Kants.  An interesting fact: the growth hormone was first introduced to the child in 1958 (MORIS BABY).  Growth hormone was obtained for a long time, up to 1996, from the pituitary glands of corpses, about 1,000 corpses were used per injection.  Then, over time, a characteristic picture began to develop in some patients - KREYNFALDA-JACOB disease (dementia, muscular weakness. It was believed that this is due to an infectious factor).  But we‚Äôll go back to the growth hormone ... I also cannot but mention the outstanding gynecologist and endocrinologist Susie Valli, who developed the famous Protocols Valli - sex hormone replacement therapy for patients after removal of the uterus and ovaries, as well as for endometriosis and other complex female pathologies, and not only for the purpose of rejuvenation.  She uses in her works only percutaneous hormonal preparations with high variability of dosages. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  In Europe, there are also founders of anti-aging medicine.  The European anti-aging school, which is headed by the hereditary doctor of medicine, endocrinologist Thierry Ertog, we owe him the free distribution of melatonin throughout the world and the availability of this epiphysis hormone in all pharmacies (we sell it as melaxen). </p><br><p>  The concept of anti-aging medicine includes not only hormone replacement therapy, but also dietetics, nutraceutical, pronounced and proper physical activity. </p><br><p>  In the history of mankind, aging is a natural biological process and only in recent years has part of the medical community begun to consider aging as a pathological process that can and should be influenced in order to preserve the quality of life.  The concept and definition of age has become deeply individual and the biological age has separated from the chronological. </p><br><p>  Aging has become "tributable diziz", that is, regarded as a treatable disease.  A number of syndromes are distinguished in aging, in particular: mitochondrial fatigue, leaky bowel syndrome, and so on. </p><br><p>  On the theories of aging, we‚Äôll dwell briefly on the achievements that we have today. Nowadays, everyone has a telomerase theory of aging with Elizabeth Parish, which compensates for the age-related lack of telomerase.  There is also an active study of genes and it is impossible not to note the famous experience with nematode worms, which in 1996 managed to rearrange part of the genes that disable aging - the worms lived twice as long.  It can be argued that the biological age is set and there is the limit of the Hyflick (i.e. the cell divides a certain number of times and dies) And I refer you again to the nematodes, in other words, it is possible to overcome the Hyflick limit.  Aging is now being studied at the intracellular level (Grace Wong, Department of Molecular Oncology in Gensnich), by the way, they synthesized recombinant growth hormone for the first time.  So, aging is largely associated with the breakdown of proteins within the cell, as well as with the destruction of DNA AND RNA with the help of which proteins are formed.  Skin, hair and bones are made up of proteins, when proteins degrade, it also happens with the structures of which they are composed (the skin becomes wrinkled, the hair falls out, the bones lose density).  What makes proteins degrade?  Free radicals that exist in all cells that use oxygen to generate energy.  Free radicals activate proteases that spoil the protein in the cell.  When a significant amount of protein is damaged, the cell dies, after which DNA fragmentation occurs.  Antioxidants, such as vitamins D and C, can remove free radicals, preventing proteases from being activated, and, well, growth hormone, this huge molecule consisting of 191 amino acids, is a direct protease inhibitor.  So the pituitary-endocrine gland axis, developed by Vladimir Dilman, can also be affected. </p><br><h4 id="ostanovimsya-bolshe-na-gormonalnoy-zamestitelnoy-terapii-i-neyroendokrinologii">  Let's stop more on hormone replacement therapy and neuroendocrinology </h4><br><p>  The basic paradigm of neuroendocrinology goes like this: "We‚Äôre enduring our hormones decline, our hormones decline."  This is the main meaning of all ACTIONS, analyzes and therapy.  Anti-endocrinology introduces not only such a thing as ‚Äúnormal hormone levels‚Äù, the spread and range of which is extensive, but also ‚Äúideal hormone levels‚Äù.  The optimal range of hormone levels is also an incorrect concept for anti-aging medicine.  For example, the level of the hormone estrogen in a 75-year-old woman should be equal to -0- and this is normal for her age, but this level of estrogen leads to a pronounced brain churn, cardiovascular dysfunction, severe osteoporosis, and so on. </p><br><p>  Hormones, as we know, are general regulators of the body's activity.  They act on chromosomes and activate certain chunks, sections (call it conveniently) of chromosomes and thus regulate the activity of cells.  There are catabolic hormones - corticosteroids, adrenaline;  and anabolic - somatotropin, testosterone, DNEA.  Hormones are also divided into central and peripheral (autocrine and paracrine) - these include neurotransmitters (seratonin, dopamine).  Hormones can also be divided into the hormones of youth - somatotropin, testosterone and hormones that contribute to aging - cortisol, insulin.  But the same hormone can play a very different role depending on whether it is in the female or male body, and in what quantity it is there: for example, estrogen in excess in the male body is an aging hormone. </p><br><p>  To reduce the effect of hormones only to narrowly specific ones is impossible.  For example, testosterone is the main male sex hormone, it is also anabolic and it is also paracrine, as it has a powerful effect on both the male and the female psyche.  What we know about the synthesis and transportation of hormones concerns mainly thyroid hormones and much is still unknown.  For example, the half-life of oxytocin is 7 seconds; nevertheless, in such a short time, it has a powerful effect on the central nervous system, causes good mood, friendliness, enhances love for relatives and is used as a nasal spray for treating age-related depression. </p><br><p> It is very important to use bioidentical hormones in anti-aging therapy, and not just synthetic ones.  What's the Difference?  In bioidentical hormones, the rotation of amino acids is left-handed and right-twisted coincides with a natural hormone;  in other words, we need the right spatial spatial orientation of the hormone molecule, only in this case it will be bioidentical.  Steroids, for example, sex hormones have the form of a ring, but in space they have the form of a chair or a boat (these are natural or bioidentical hormones).  A synthetic hormone is just a collection of acids with no characteristics.  In anti-aging medicine, the ways of hormone delivery are important, and transdermal (transdermal) access for sex hormones is preferable.  When taking hormones per pus - protein fractions are formed in the liver, which increase blood clotting.  Hormones have a powerful effect on the immune system, protect against chronic inflammation, stimulate the production of stem cells in the body: for example, progesterone stimulates the production of stem cells in the brain, testosterone stimulates the satillite cells in the muscles. </p><br><p>  Optimizing hormone levels leads to the first step in stimulating your own stem cells. </p><br><p>  We all are well aware of the fact that there are diseases directly associated with aging: in the United States at the age of 65 years, mortality from heart disease is one third of the total number of deaths, cancer is 20-25%;  cerebrovascular diseases - 10%, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases - 5%, pneumonia - 4%, diabetes - 6%, and others. About 15% more. </p><br><p>  Hormones, when used properly, protect against cancer and chronic inflammation, prevent the development of hypertension, and other vascular pathologies.  The notion that hormones cause cancer is outdated, like the jurassic lizards!  For example, the use of estrodiol without the use of progesterone is unacceptable, because  This adversely affects the endometrium.  And the wider use of melatonin with age as an antitumor hormone is important. </p><br><p>  Another thing is that the use of hormones must be reasonable and individual.  It is possible to apply HRT only on the examined and prepared organism. </p><br><p>  Anti-aging medicine is a complex of measures consisting of the use of hormones, nutrients, diet and physical activity. </p><br><p>  Starting an anti-aging program begins with a diet.  Danelle Radmen believes that starting from the age of 35, the human body turns from green and young into soft and liquid in the face of reduced hormones, fat mass increases by 50 percent, while the lean mass that develops from the mass of muscles, bones and organs reduced by 30 percent.  Correction of insulin peaks in the blood, the rejection of sweets, harmful fast carbohydrates, nutritional adjustment of insulin levels will already lead to improved health and add strength.  It also saves most healthy people from insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia.  Removing type A from cozein will reduce chronic inflammation and allergization, and removing gluten from food will also relieve the body.  improve intestinal function </p><br><p>  Physical activity is not excessive, but regular is our everything. Only physical activity and short non-stressful hunger strikes can stimulate our own growth hormone. </p><br><p>  Nutrients - a class of elements that are normally present in our body and decrease with age, or their number changes.  For example.  the young body is able to synthesize sucrose in the liver, but with age this ability fades away.  Also, nutrients include vitamins, micro- and macronutrients, non-replaceable amino acids, unsaturated fatty acids, etc.  Proper replenishment of these elements is part of anti-aging therapy.  The determination of the level of vitamins in the blood is a good help: we only have vitamin D, B12, folic acid, and it is also possible to determine homocysteine ‚Äã‚Äãas a vascular factor of aging and accumulation of errors during DNA deletion.  I will not dwell on this in more detail, since this is the topic of a separate article. </p><br><p>  Let's go back to hormones and age. According to Professor Hamoshinoy, the average birth rate among Russians overtook 35 years, moreover, 35 years old give birth more often than 20 years, and every 12th abortions were performed in women over 45 years old in 2012.  In the US, these numbers are even greater.  The average age of laboring women is approaching the age of 40.  In addition, in the United States, women over 60 years of age with a pronounced substitution effect (in particular, the Valli protocols are used) have resorted to hormone replacement therapy.  Well, some more numbers - people over 60 are getting bigger, the growth of older people was 8.1 percent in 1950 and 10 percent in 2000, by 250 this figure will be 22.1 percent.  Conclusion: you need a quality of life. </p><br><p>  A decrease in the level of sex hormones begins at about 35 years of age.  Now these numbers are even lower due to malnutrition.  Reducing, in particular, omega-3 in food to catastrophically low indicators. </p><br><p>  Does hormone replacement therapy always start with sex hormone replacement? </p><br><p>  No not always.  We know that hormones have multiple effects and synergism, in some cases antagonism.  In assignments, we rely on the patient‚Äôs analysis, research, history, and complaints.  Earlier treatment at 40 years of age, for example, allows you to lead a patient for a long time without using sex hormones (I'm talking about healthy people), all chronic inflammation at the time of applying for anti-aging therapy should be compensated.  Often, therapy starts with the use of growth hormone or testosterone in women.  Mandatory compensation of thyroid hormones and also diet and physical activity.  If necessary, the level of vitamins and other nutrients is adjusted. </p><br><h4 id="do-nachala-lyuboy-antieydzhingovoy-programmy-nuzhno-obsledovanie">  Before the start of any anti-aging program you need a survey! </h4><br><p>  The possibility of genetic analysis is very good, since there are well-established patterns of susceptibility to a particular type of oncology, and indicators for which, for example, Angelina Jolie, has removed both mammary glands.  So this is a great help ... Do not forget that our HRT affects genes.  If everything is good here, then a hormonal profile and a number of biochemical parameters are examined.  Also important are the wishes of the patient, a thorough study of complaints and psychological status (for this, in addition to the examination and collection of anamnesis, use questionnaires), the age of the patient is also important.  The earlier the treatment (i.e. I mean after 40 years), the better and easier it is to preserve youth.  Treatment in menopause and the postmenopausal period leads to a more rapid appointment of direct sex hormones, early treatment makes it possible to lead a patient for a long time without direct sex hormones.  Patient management schemes for somatotropin with regular physical exertion and short fasting are very popular in the USA, which allows maintaining muscle mass and the level of your own sex hormones for a long time.  Adjustment of insulin levels is mandatory and early.  Ideally, of course, when a person eats all his life.  Getting rid of insulin peaks leads to the preservation of proper body weight, prevents obesity, and in general age-related weight gain.  On average, the mass of women with unchanged diet increases by 3.5 kg per year with age after 40. </p><br><p>  With age, all hormone levels decrease, sometimes smoothly, but more often in leaps and bounds.  Some of the hormones with age may increase or change sensitivity to them.  Compensate and balance hormones - the task of anti-aging medicine.  With aging, it is possible to increase individual hormones, which usually indicates the development of pathology (this is against the background of a general decrease in hormones);  if we see a discrepancy and an increased level of estrogen (most often it is associated with female pathology, such as endometriosis), then a gynecologist-endocrinologist, such as Susie Valli, and individually selected therapy and correction are needed.  Quite often, prolactin in men is elevated with age, especially with undiagnosed pathology, hyperprolactinemia is most often associated with chronic fatigue syndrome ‚Äî then passive rest is introduced into therapy, yoga, it shows itself perfectly in therapy with oxytocin, melatonin, and so on.  With age, estrogen is very and very often increased in men, i.e.  we are faced with a picture of normal or decreased testosterone and elevated estradiol in men.  Of course, with age this occurs against the background of testosterone aroma in the liver, in other words, such a man will have less and less active good dehydrotestosterone and more and more estradiol.  In this case, prescribe drugs that inhibit the process of aromatization, for example, using the American drug miomin.  Also, such a man just needs to adjust liver function, normal nutrition, sports, a categorical rejection of beer.  Men with elevated estradiol can be seen in their behavior - more emotional.  I like the example of table tennis, when men accompany the delivery of the ball with screams.  Such men are more conflicted, verbose.  Also, in addition to changes in behavior and emotionality, we know that estradiol in the male body leads to the growth of prostate cells and leads to adenoma.  In such cases, the correction is simply necessary, along with maintaining a urologist. </p><br><p>  In women with aging, in addition to sex hormones, cortisol can be increased as a stress indicator.  Women are generally more prone to a shortage of neurotransmitters (from 35 to 55 years old, the level of neurotransmitters in women is generally lower than that of men), but with what it is not yet clear.  It is believed that with greater social responsibility in women (USA, Europe), therefore, women in age are more likely to increase cortisol.  Also, women are more likely to have hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, the regulation of nutrition in this case is simply necessary.  The remaining hormones are reduced, and women are prone to a more rapid decrease in thyroid hormones. </p><br><p>  In conclusion, I want to say that anti-aging therapy can also be initiated in deep postmenopause.  In these cases, preference is given to DNEA as the base hormone: it improves the quality of life of the elderly.  Anti-edging medicine is also applicable to neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and oncology patients, life can also be improved. </p></div>
