      Recall that February 11th Yahoo Inc.  officially refused to offer to sell for $ 44.6 billion, received a week earlier from Microsoft.  This decision was made by the board of directors of the company.  However, <a href="http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx%3FDocsID%3D851524">analysts believed</a> that the struggle for the purchase of Yahoo would not end there, and Microsoft would increase the amount of the offer. <br><br>  After that, the big three quarreled: Microsoft said that Google controls 75% of the global Internet search, and strong competitors are needed to grow the quality of service, and those can appear only after the merger of M and Y. Google was offended and quite reasonably noticed that Yahoo's takeover Gates company will dictate its conditions not only in the market of operating systems, but also on the Web, and this will lead to a catastrophe.  After that, Google offered support to the guys from Y. The latter decided that they were completely independent and finally refused the offer, although according <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/ousiv/idUSN0362915520080203">to Reuters, they had</a> a rather good discussion of a possible alliance with Google. <br><br>  What happened next could not have been foreseen by anyone: the <a href="http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/articlenews.aspx%3Ftype%3DinternetNews%26storyid%3D2008-02-27T230357Z_01_N27479621_RTRIDST_0_OUKIN-UK-YAHOO-LAWSUIT.XML">retirees rebelled</a> .  The fact is that a significant part of Yahoo shares was in the hands of a number of pension funds, which would be arranged by selling the company's shares for more than twice the market value.  The old people were so divided that they had already filed seven lawsuits against the administration of the largest portal for the refusal of management to sell the company. <br><br>  Microsoft decided to play on this by starting a power of attorney fight.  This is a legal process during which a separate group of shareholders is seeking the right to vote with its number of shares (it should be significant) for the personal list of the board of directors.  Lawyers of the company contacted representatives of offended old foots with the aim of pushing the company's employees loyally to small-scale employees to the board of directors. <br><br>  According <a href="http://www.cnews.ru/news/top/index.shtml%3F2008/02/20/288913">to experts</a> , the struggle for powers of attorney will cost Microsoft from $ 20 million to $ 30 million. ‚ÄúMicrosoft is doing very well,‚Äù said Toan Tran, an analyst at research company Morningstar.  ‚ÄúAt first, they made an offer to buy Yahoo for $ 44.6 billion, and now they will try to get the board of directors to accept it under the threat of bias.‚Äù  Solid savings, because the increase in the value of the shares at least 1% would cost Microsoft at least a half billion evergreen bills. <br><br>  Finally, Yahoo realized that they were being taken seriously: it was rumored on the Web that the company representatives met with people from AOL, then bowed to Rupert Murdoch.  And if the symbiosis of Yahoo with the first looks strange, then you should think about the possible help from News Corp.  First, the offer from Murdoch has already been received by the company, although it rejected it.  Secondly, Yahoo could be significantly strengthened if the social network MySpace was included as Yahoo Mash, in fact, died after birth, its popularity is extremely low.  Thirdly, according to the same rumors, Murdoch is offered 20% for financial assistance, and given the growth of the online advertising market, this is very tempting.  The fact is that advertising from Yahoo <a href="http://www.webplanet.ru/news/business/2007/11/30/yahoo_pdfads.html">even snuck into PDF</a> , and this once again proves that the Internet giant is second in the market after Google.  In the end, it is worth considering that by 2009 the ad market will double, and therefore the billions invested will be back for Microsoft with a vengeance. <br><br>  Monopoly is here, monopoly is there, couples memory, couples memory.  It is possible that such a winner‚Äôs hymn will soon be sung by Steve Ballmer and Billy Gates, dancing on the bones of Jerry Yang. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/21196/">https://habr.com/ru/post/21196/</a></p>
