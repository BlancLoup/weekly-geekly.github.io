After 13 ‚Äùhe seemed too heavy and uncomfortable.  It was decided to sell it and take something small for replacement. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/2ee01aa9/a213f049/443d0f1f/171aa0a2.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Laptop sale </h4><br>  I wrote a few ads.  Including on Molotok.ru.  A few hours after putting the lot on the hammer, I received a message in the mail that the lot was won.  The buyer was registered on the day of purchase and did not identify himself in the comments to the purchase. <br>  In order to make sure that the person really wants to buy a laptop from me, I wrote him a congratulatory letter. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/71eb6883/97b4b101/6b14d9d9/9f98e5c5.png" alt="image"><br><br>  A day later I received a response from the buyer. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/da48a54a/d9ffa78e/d67ce3de/2a1ea485.png" alt="image">

      In short: a laptop was bought for his son on his birthday, who lives in Nigeria and deals with foreign languages.  The buyer asks to send the parcel via EMS and tell him the full amount with delivery.  Also, he needs my bank details. <br>  Judging by the country, it seemed that the scammers were working.  I replied to the buyer that I send overseas only after ‚ÄúClear Payment‚Äù via PayPal. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/0480e00a/a3ec762a/8f1fb718/59fed24a.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The buyer is not in a hurry with the answers.  Letters from him come on average 12-15 hours after mine.  New letter from the buyer: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/a930a0c3/837c59b9/f3b1639b/1e17acae.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The buyer agrees to this option.  He asks for the full price in $ or Euro along with delivery.  Well, we will inform: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/d1f14d72/7e01e052/f54cde40/5cbac14d.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Fraud scheme </h4><br>  And here begins the most interesting.  Somewhere in 12 hours a letter comes from Service@paypal.com with the following content: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/8eec23d7/904d3fe6/aa31b9c4/652ee837.png" alt="image"><br><br>  It seems that the money is transferred to your account, but confirmation of sending is required.  After that the transfer will be confirmed.  But the sender's address is strange, and the design style does not match the style of PayPal.  Do I have to say that there was no transfer in your PayPal account?  Also, the scammer sent another letter: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/2ef6d39d/87eedcd0/73ddc3da/9f299d38.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Here, in principle, the same is written.  Send us the tracking code and we will transfer you the money. <br>  At this, our communication has stopped, the scheme is simple and clear.  Not interesting anymore. <br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br><ul><li>  Carefully study the buyer.  Especially if he is from Nigeria.  And especially if the lot is expensive. </li><li>  In the morning, money-evening chairs.  Do not send anything until you are sure that the money is in your account and you can manage it. </li><li>  Carefully look at the letters from the payment system. </li><li>  Three times think about whether to send the lot abroad.  Maybe there is a buyer in your country? </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Morality </h4><br>  This divorce scheme is simple and straightforward.  It is very difficult to tell.  But if you are an inexperienced seller or you currently have a huge amount of lots, you may simply not notice the scammer. <br>  Be careful and successful sales! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/123600/">https://habr.com/ru/post/123600/</a></p>
