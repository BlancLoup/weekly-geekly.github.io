This tradition has been maintained for almost 8 years.  During this time, we changed quite a few places and formats of meetings, having stopped at the welcoming and comfortable office of Mail.Ru Group.  Our meetings are not ‚Äúa club for our own people‚Äù, we are open both for Moscow.pm veterans and for beginners.  We are going to exchange experience and knowledge, and at the same time communicate with those who share our interests.  For example, there was a case in which a 40-minute speech turned into a three-hour discussion in which all those present participated. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Our next meeting will be of interest not only to programmers, but also to specialists in e-commerce, as well as to all who, with the word "turn", involuntarily reach for the Mauser.  Interesting information from the report on code generation can also be gathered by programmers who are trying in every possible way to optimize their work and not do extra work.

Excel files are the most popular way to exchange data in e-commerce.  They are used by many companies both for internal document circulation and for providing information to clients.  Natalia's report will be devoted to the subtleties and nuances of working with similar files: how to write and read documents with a different structure, which can be difficult, including unobvious.  First of all, we will talk about the Excel 1997-2003 (XLS) format and the modules: Spreadsheet :: ParseExcel, Spreadsheet :: WriteExcel and Excel :: Template. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e76/901/03e/e7690103e5f944d9b026ad13de5eeb32.jpg" align="left">  Ivan Sokolov, teamlead REG.RU, will give a talk on ‚ÄúFastQueue - as we made our turn on Perl and Redis‚Äù.  He will talk about one of the most popular tools in programming - about the queue.  In particular, queues are used to process downloadable user media content, to work with payment systems, etc.  REG.RU has long had the need to find a suitable solution for working with queues.  Unfortunately, the vast majority of existing solutions could not be integrated into the company's business processes due to the specifics of its type of activity.  Therefore, they decided to do everything themselves.  In his report, Ivan will tell you about the architecture of the queue, its capabilities, and for what tasks it is used. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0bd/6ad/f11/0bd6adf11fe040d1911f3b7403ea303f.png" align="left">  And the third report in our meeting will be called "Plasticine code: how to stop coding and start living."  Its author is Elena Shishkina, lead programmer of the Money Mail.Ru project.  She will talk about how to deal with the need to write the same type and non-same type code, as well as about a variety of situations faced by programmers who do not want to do unnecessary or extra work.  Elena will tell you what are the exits and professional techniques in certain cases. <br><br>  <a href="http://corp.mail.ru/ru/press/events/48/">The meeting</a> will take place on February 5 at the Mail.Ru Group office at Leningradsky Avenue, 39, p. 79, do not forget to register!  Beginning at 19:30.  Be sure to bring your passport or driver's license! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/249255/">https://habr.com/ru/post/249255/</a></p>
