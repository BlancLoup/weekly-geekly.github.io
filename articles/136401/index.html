      You can buy expensive and not very massage seats or chairs on wheels, but all the same - the spine does not move freely even in such a chair.  Let it even made of crocodile skin is made and it costs a lot of money. <br><br>  Since I am not a small man, back pain periodically arose.  Perhaps this problem applies to low people, but we know it for sure. <br>  He began to think, analyze ... and tried to deal with it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At school, teachers often made comments to us: ‚ÄúDo not turn around!  Don't twist! ‚Äù <br>  But kids are zinger!  They continued their fidgety business. <br><br>  Getting up adults, many people have not lost this childhood habit - they love to wiggle on the chairs ... I want to, and that's that! <br>  Himself was so.  Chairs are loosened, broken, floor covering deteriorates. <br><br>  So that the lumbar spine can move easily while sitting, it is necessary ... that the harnesse should hang in the air!  That is a chair without legs! <br>  ... <br>  Turn the chair over, replace the legs with flexible ties and fasten it to the ceiling. <br>  Result: got a swing in the workplace. <br>  Note that a person at any age pulls on a swing! <br><br>  Then began the decision of various subtleties: <br>  - it is necessary to turn easily - used one point of suspension; <br>  - emphasis for the back - ‚Äútemporarily‚Äù made it from the same cable; <br>  - ventilation - seat is assembled from three boards with slots between them; <br>  - wear resistance - covered with semi-matte parquet lacquer in 6 layers - did not regret the varnish! <br><br>  Since this is not exactly a classic swing (a cross between a chair, a bench and a swing), we will add a new word to the lexicon: <br>  <b>Vertexazhnitsa</b> - device for torsion-twisting. <br>  By the way, the abbreviation of derivatives also gives a beautiful name - Aka's chair, but I like the spinner more - it reflects the essence of the process. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/comment_images/b7a/5db/638/b7a5db6389c53af43d22826e1497a94b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  She was born on Saturday, March 12, 2011. <br>  Soon will be the first birthday!  And there is no desire to stop the experiment. <br><br>  During the operation of the chopper, a number of additional advantages of such a ‚Äúlifestyle‚Äù were revealed: <br>  - at work I‚Äôm spinning all day; <br>  - a sedentary lifestyle has become mobile; <br>  - the back is in motion; <br>  - the vestibular apparatus is trained; <br>  - lightness in the body after sitting; <br>  - the floor covering from the legs of the chair or the wheels of the chair does not wear out; <br>  - simultaneously with the work, you can perform many different exercises (spine, arms, legs, abdominals); <br>  - the distance to the monitor changes and the eyesight is trained.  Variants: back and forth, or like a Ka-50 helicopter spinning around a target in a famous old movie. <br><br>  The advantage is also a convenient movement: everything that is within a radius of two meters is easily accessible in one swing, and moreover, very quickly, compared to an armchair on castors. <br><br>  Unlike any chair or chair, the design was very strong - there is nothing to break! <br><br>  The construction of the garterbare was especially noted by the cleaning lady - she doesn‚Äôt need to be moved like the chairs of other employees, legs are not.  In extreme cases - you can throw on the table. <br>  In other people, the attitude is not unambiguous, but in any case - it makes you smile, which also pleases! <br>  Shock is the most appropriate word, describing the emotion of seeing the hacksmith in the workplace.  I agree - not everyone dares to use such a device. <br>  Well, I achieved what I wanted - my back does not hurt. <br><br>  <b>Directions of modernization.</b> <br>  - make an emphasis for the back of a strip of dense matter; <br>  - replace the clips with something more aesthetic or abandon them; <br>  - the upper part of the hanger can be covered with a soft material or even an anatomical shape (I prefer the Spartan version); <br>  - make the height of the ‚Äúflight‚Äù more convenient and operational; <br>  - the blue duct tape has already been partially replaced with black and plastic clamps, but we still need to think. <br><br>  Photos with different details and changes for the past period are in the electronic <a href="http://foto.mail.ru/mail/radikn/1181">photo album</a> . <br><br>  <b>Materials</b> <br>  1. Seated - lime boards 750x90x27 mm - 3 pcs. <br>  2. The hook hook for mounting to the ceiling - diameter 8 mm, length 170 mm.  It is necessary to carefully approach the search for the drilling point; for me, it was successfully between the floor slabs.  You also need to find a convenient distance to the tabletop. <br>  3. Cable - solid, synthetic, diameter 8 mm, length also 8, but meters (depending on the ceiling height).  The distance between the verticals is 72 cm, so as not to interfere with the elbows. <br>  4. Tow - to reduce cable wear when passing through the ceiling hook and ease of dismantling. <br>  5. Polypropylene tubes for the passage of the cable.  Diameter 20 mm - 2 pcs.  x 200 mm and 1 pc.  x 30 mm. <br>  6. U-shaped profile with punching - mounting boards and a guide for the cable. <br>  7. Clips - fixing the cable, 2 pcs. <br>  8. The strut is horizontal - to ensure the verticality of the cable and adjust the height of the cushion.  Made of wooden bar 820x30x20 mm. <br>  9. A few screws. <br>  10. Blue insulating tape - how can it be without it? <br><br>  Now I looked for a similar on the Internet.  Something similar is produced for children - with a harnesse in the form of a hammock. <br>  About the application of the design directly at the workplace did not find anything. <br><br>  Our flight takes place at a height of 45 cm. Unbutton your thoughts and take a comfortable position! <br><br>  <b>Habrohronika.</b> <br>  1. <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/DIY/135806/">Lamp time.</a> <br>  2. <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/136051/">Flying capacitor.</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/136401/">https://habr.com/ru/post/136401/</a></p>
