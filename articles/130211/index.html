And if such situations are not familiar to you, then please, let us leave the disputes - they will be long and useless. <br>  Since the task of this article is not to choose the most suitable guillotine or the strongest rope to execute.

      <br>
      So let's get started.  We will go gradually to dive into thoughts of what is happening. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  The first.  Start </h4><br>  Imagine you are going to a friend for a birthday.  You walk along the avenue, and then there is a sudden fog, but such that you can see no further than 5 meters.  What's happening?  The first feeling is the loss of reality.  But, gathering with you (it may take a second), you start searching for a solution.  Similarly, with this happens in life, you are engaged in some task, and suddenly fog comes.  Something is changing dramatically.  For example, suddenly someone introduced ‚Äúa very important, but for some reason, small detail, which was forgotten to be mentioned.‚Äù <br>  Nothing super-original is required, we simply strain the necessary skills and begin to look for a solution, relying on the nearest signs and knowledge of the final goal.  In a simple way - "pulled the straps and forward." <br><br><h4>  The second.  amount </h4><br>  Let's now imagine that there are more such tasks than one.  Suppose they are 3-4.  As an exit, you pull the straps even higher and go with the fight.  And now let's say they are 10-20.  As an option - delegation.  Good.  And what if there are even more, and there are not enough resources?  Simple and clear way is not so good.  But you can make an effort and find a way out for tasks. <br><br><h4>  Third.  Final goal </h4><br>  Until now, we meant that each situation has its own purpose, i.e.  final destination.  And what will happen if we do not know the final destination.  Those.  there are assumptions, but you can‚Äôt imagine and touch them.  Not only is fog, but there is also no understanding of the ultimate goal.  The simplest example - you are looking for a lady of the heart.  On this difficult path your ideas are constantly changing. <br>  And as the most suitable method is an iterative one.  When stage by stage you go to your goal. <br><br><h4>  Fourth.  Mirages </h4><br>  Imagine that you were invited to a "fashionable place."  They described it to you as unforgettable and fantastic.  You start to go.  And suddenly there is fog.  In fact, it turns out that the place is a "dilapidated house."  And after going all this way, you begin to scratch your head hard.  As an example, you are offered to do business that will bring billions!  Yes, such things happen.  But, the site on the museum of local history of school number 5 is unlikely to pull.  It is a little reduced to the absolute, but, nevertheless, I think is familiar.  You can capture the emotions of the thought of a billion.  And you can rush into a business that is not only unrealizable by the 1st person, but also requires large investments.  And the saddest thing that the output will not have any benefits. <br>  You can go through iterations, and sooner or later realize this.  But time will be lost a lot.  The logical option is to check at the first stages not the implementation, but the necessity.  There is nothing new in this. <br><br><h4>  The fifth.  Random occurrence and random obstacles </h4><br>  Only you have decided on the questions ‚Äúhow?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhere?‚Äù, Etc.  As a new task arises, requiring urgent solutions, and again representing something vague.  And what if not one and at the most inappropriate moments?  The logical option is to prioritize and incorporate time into your plans.  And if there are several?  Here the problem especially has weight, if the overriding priority is tied to someone's opinion.  Or, for example, on the standards ‚Äúthis is Uncle Vasya's requirement‚Äù (did not specifically cite other examples, so that there would be no conflicts due to misunderstanding). <br>  It is also necessary to take into account that random obstacles may arise.  Remember, you are in the fog, so you may not see that after 800 meters everything has been dug up due to a pipe burst.  Or you feel bad (pah-pah-pah).  And yet it is a reality.  Again, the logical option is to prioritize and incorporate time into your plans.  But, unfortunately, this does not always go with a bang. <br><br><h4>  The sixth.  Falsity </h4><br>  When your path initially has completely different goals and objectives.  And you as a performer will be the last informed about it.  The point is that you go to a goal that can and is achievable, maybe understandable, but you will not reach it.  Here, by the way, the favorite female reception (forgive me for this secret).  You will be stopped exactly at the moment when another person achieves his goal.  Or simply he will leave you to continue, as it is lazy to invent an obstacle or a way out if it is not a more ‚Äúimportant‚Äù goal.  A simple example, let's say you are going to move from one job to another.  It happened.  And as a conscientious worker, you finish current affairs.  But, the employer is not very interested in your care.  And it‚Äôs impossible to lure you with candy.  One option is to give you a job that you really can‚Äôt manage to finish before leaving.  Better even two.  Mist fog.  Give importance.  After a short period of time casually suggest sweets.  Outline the bright prospects.  Depending on whether you are only going to look for a job, as well as how much you can play with your conscience, then you can be held with an appropriate probability, while simply changing the ‚Äúcurtains‚Äù.  The true goal is to keep you, not the importance of these tasks or their very presence. <br>  It is important not to be confused with the "mirage".  As a simple example of difference, exaggeration is going on in the mirage, but in the ‚Äúfalsity‚Äù just the goal itself is different. <br>  It‚Äôs not easy to deal with such things.  But as a logical option - to watch the dynamics of events. <br><br>  I think enough points. <br><br><h4>  Picture </h4><br>  Total  There are a lot of nebulous tasks where there are not always final goals.  Tasks arise here and there.  Obstacles grow simply from nothing to do.  Scheduled plans fail.  Even absolute events break down "by chance."  And among the tasks there are false and embellished. <br>  What is it called?  Correct, Chaos. <br>  You can blame yourself for it.  Look for the guilty.  To lament.  Beat your head against the wall.  Fall into deep depression and for a long time (I sincerely wish you never to experience this).  Search for cheap axes.  But all this will not help you.  It is necessary to postpone the search for the guilty and the reasons for everything at once.  We must get out of this situation. <br>  As you get out of the situation, you will understand the true causes.  And to draw the appropriate conclusions.  Moreover, these findings can surprise you very much. <br><br><h4>  What to do? </h4><br>  If you expect any secret methods, then grieve you.  Everything consists of simple and understandable actions.  But!  No matter how simple they are, they can sometimes be a long way to go.  And you can not reach.  Look at the statistics of alcoholics.  They could not find the strength to cope with what is happening.  Not all, of course.  But the good part could not cope with the problems hanging over them.  And they found a way out for themselves.  Right or wrong.  Necessary or not needed is not for us to decide. <br>  (This does not mean that this article will help 100%) <br><br><h4>  Let's get down to business. </h4><br>  Let's remember what is at stake.  About Chaos, filled with fog and all sorts of charms. <br>  The first thing to remember.  In these cases, standard planning methods simply do not work.  Hard schedule "tomorrow at 14 to Vasya, from 11 to 15 I will unload" - is likely to be doomed to failure.  You have not forgotten that random obstacles and tasks arise? <br>  Despite all the fantastic statements, but Chaos has its own order.  It is simply different, so standard methods cannot be used.  Have you ever noticed that experienced drivers drive through traffic jams faster (and without using trimming, pacing on the sidewalk, going to the oncoming lane)?  They just feel this Chaos, or rather the order of this Chaos.  They assess a huge number of factors, and, based on them, make a decision.  Factors can be from the road surface down to the minute scratch on the bumper of the car through the row.  But, while the situation is always different, therefore, the actions are different.  Something I digress. <br><br>  If you do not abandon the standard planning methods, then there is a high probability that such tasks will simply overwhelm you, you will spend time on redevelopment, solve unnecessary tasks.  Give all tasks a huge amount of attention.  And when you start to get tired, they will start overwhelming you. <br><br><h4>  Ok, we abandoned the standard methods.  What to do now? </h4><br><h5>  The most important thing to keep in mind the following thoughts: </h5><br><ul><li>  - It's Chaos </li><li>  - The fog has both minuses and pros </li><li>  - Absolutely all knowledge can be used (yes, Uncle Angol is drinking) </li></ul><br><br><h5>  We continue with the formulation of real problems: </h5><br><ul><li>  - Stop wasting time and energy on false tasks and ‚Äúmirages‚Äù tasks (for simplicity, let's call them unnecessary) </li><li>  - Cut unnecessary tasks at the very first stages, preferably immediately </li><li>  - Track the causes of unnecessary tasks and develop methods to counter their occurrence as such </li><li>  - Track the causes of foggy tasks </li><li>  - Develop and successfully use the method / s to counter the occurrence of nebulous tasks </li><li>  - To control the situation at a sufficient level for a calm and comfortable activity </li><li>  - Use the nebula for its own purposes </li><li>  - Solve problems </li></ul><br><br>  It seems that this, too, is a standard task-setting method.  But these tasks are also foggy tasks.  Why add more tasks you ask?  Yes, because, having solved these problems, you will significantly simplify the situation.  Why foggy?  Yes, because the path to them is not known, everyone will have their own decisions, and they will approach only him. <br><br>  Are you waiting for an algorithm or method?  So you forgot the first thought - "This is Chaos." <br>  The only thing that can be offered is a set of actions.  When you are trying to find a way in the fog, do not act according to a clearly defined algorithm, either compose it on the go, or once made up on the go. <br><br><h5>  Go: </h5><br><ul><li>  - Take time for yourself when you do only what you like.  Yes, yes, at this moment just forget about everything around, you are only engaged in yourself </li><li>  - Periodically assess what happened exactly from your point of view.  Not what they say to you, but what you think.  But do not make quick conclusions </li><li>  - Catch with whom exactly the found unnecessary tasks were connected (by the way, a person can only be a transmission link) </li><li>  - Feel that now a wave of fatigue will roll, rest, but in moderation.  Better to move than to spoil </li><li>  - Starting the task, remember the people with whom this task is connected.  Their desires, their habits, their priorities </li><li>  - Feel that the task changes directions too often - a bell </li><li>  - Feel that you are too actively customized (without real arguments) - bell </li><li>  - Feel that everything is described too beautifully - bell </li><li>  - Being engaged in a task, pay attention to what you remember along with this task. </li><li>  - Reduce time monitoring and control of the task, you can not give tasks all the time.  Forget about minor losses, and return to the task either when you need a new action, or a non-standard event (for example, walk 500 meters straight, hammer on something that sometimes hurt people, and return to the task only if you see a big object, or reached the end of the road, or ran out 500 meters) </li><li>  - Mentally or on paper, put checkouts </li><li>  - Remember that fog is also your friend (you can always fulfill the dream of ‚Äúdancing in the main square, with a lot of people‚Äù) </li><li>  - Do not bring down your problems on other people (you have a lot of them, the person on the contrary will not survive).  Better suggestive questions, may the person know the answer to any of your questions. </li><li>  - Evaluate the in / out pair.  Remember not the whole task, but only its features. </li><li>  - When a new task arrives, do not make hasty conclusions or decisions.  Wait until you have the time and situation to think so that no one advises you.  Try to think how you would set the task, what you would do ‚Äúin / out‚Äù, how real it is, how important the task is, what you know about the person, what experience with this person (in the case of a negative, it can be just an accident) </li><li>  - When you receive a new task, do not make drastic changes in anything, everything should be as usual (if you are imposed an unnecessary task, then circumstances may immediately change your disturbances) </li><li>  - If you doubt something, try to assess in concrete terms what will happen if you do not do it, and what will happen if you do.  At least 2-3 steps forward.  And look how much the last step will be utopian. </li><li>  - If the task is unnecessary, then you do not act according to the method ‚Äúso much is done, the last spurt left‚Äù (but if you don‚Äôt know how to turn the ending in your direction) </li><li>  - When you are alone or with trusted representatives (this is important), then laugh and make fun of the situation. </li><li>  - Bring humor to your daily life. </li><li>  - Let yourself fool around sometimes </li><li>  - It would not be regrettable, but always keep in your mind the option that you alone will do this, that there will be no help.  By the way, in this version, you can stop the task at all. </li><li>  - Starting the task, think about the reality in the actions </li><li>  - Do not deny yourself new information </li><li>  - Remember ‚Äúflexibility‚Äù and ‚Äúdetachment‚Äù - your friends </li></ul><br><br>  Probably enough.  See for yourself the rest. <br>  Select suitable items.  And gradually solving your problems, you will find answers to the added tasks.  And you will stop all that you do not need. <br><br><h4>  Why foggy planning, but not foggy tasks? </h4><br>  It's simple.  In any case, you are planning, albeit in a somewhat strange way. <br><br>  PS By the way, if you have 1-2 such cases, the results will not reach those that would be if you ‚Äúpulled the straps‚Äù. <br>  PPS I do not pretend to be new.  Perhaps there are techniques, or I describe some method known to you.  The essence of this post is to help people who are faced with these problems, and are looking for a way out of the situation. <br>  PPPS By the way, a number of points I think, and so everyone does, though not necessarily consciously;) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/130211/">https://habr.com/ru/post/130211/</a></p>
