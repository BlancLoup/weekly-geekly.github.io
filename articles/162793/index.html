Because after three years of hard work on the development of the notorious ‚Äúeducation 2.0‚Äù, I have to conclude that too few leaders of our high school understand the overall strategy of the global academic environment.

      I tried to put together a basic squeeze in this post so that anyone could link to it and say ‚Äúlook, where everything moves.‚Äù  And maybe it will run to the administration of some good university. <br><br>  So, first a little pathos. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Over the past few years, the market for educational services in the world began to change significantly.  The most serious players began to launch ambitious educational projects that are built on completely different principles.  We need to study their experience, to be ready for new realities.  To understand the overall picture, first a small historical digression: <br><br><h5>  OCW history </h5><br>  MIT OpenCourseWare (MIT OCW) is a project of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the purpose of which is to publish in the public domain the materials of its entire educational program.  From lecture notes and videos to homework and slides. <br><br>  This project is one of the first in the world to set an example for many other universities. <br>  From the start in 2002 to 2009, MIT tried to monetize this project in different ways.  We consistently tried all the options: from distance education and advertising to selling full-time special courses.  But it did not give results.  And then the organizers of OCW decided to declare the project non-commercial and attracted investment funds. <br><br>  A few years later, it turned out that, besides increasing the authority of MIT, the project brings direct benefits by attracting the best students.  About 35% of students enrolled at MIT say that OCW influenced their choice.  In addition, OCW improves the quality of teaching within the school itself, as professors are more responsible in preparing materials that will be published for a wide audience. <br><br>  Unexpected was the composition of the audience.  Initially it was assumed that the resource will be used by MIT students, MIT graduates or teachers from other universities.  But the result of the study in 2009 showed that more than half of the audience are people engaged in self-education. <br><br>  In 2005, OCW Concorcium was created to share experiences and content with other universities, MIT partners. <br><br>  <b>OCW numbers:</b> <br>  10-15 thousand. $ The cost of preparing one course (10-15 lectures) <br>  5-6 hours the teacher spends on the preparation of one course, everything else is done by a special team <br>  80% of the educational program published (2000 courses) <br>  Total budget over $ 150 million (for more than 10 years) <br><br>  <b>Aggregators:</b> <br>  Various services began to accumulate lectures created for similar OCW programs.  Examples: Youtube.com/edu, Academic Earth. <br>  References: <br>  OCW MIT <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/">ocw.mit.edu</a> <br>  OCW Concorcium <a href="http://www.ocwconsortium.org/">www.ocwconsortium.org</a> <br><br><h5>  Distance education, new players </h5><br>  Apparently, the period of initial accumulation of content and the development of technology has already been completed.  In 2011-2012, several large projects were launched, which, on the one hand, use technology and content accumulated during the launch of OCW (and similar initiatives) as the base, and on the other hand, represent a full-fledged distance education. <br>  In fact, there is now a seizure of the educational market in the part where full-time presence and feedback are not priority or are easily formalized.  For example, computer science, where the result of homework is the correct code. <br><br>  In addition, there is a forum around each course, wikis, groups of students organize themselves in FB, Skype, etc., enthusiasts create subtitles.  And that means creating your own renewable audience.  Which just can not buy. <br><br>  What will happen next?  After the market is captured, commercialization will begin, and full-time education will only rise in price.  Weak players will begin to be forced out if they cannot change their orientation or profile.  And most importantly, they will begin to lose promising students. <br>  I am sure that this is a question of 5-10 years. <br><br>  <b>Features of running projects:</b> <br>  1. All courses must be recorded in advance.  You cannot connect to a course that is already being read. <br>  2. All course material is divided into small, easy to learn, complete fragments. <br>  For example, a video lecture - no more than 15 minutes. <br>  3. Courses are interspersed with tests and tasks that need to be taken in a certain period. <br>  4. The final exam is offered.  Successful delivery of it gives an electronic certificate, which currently has no legal force, but nonetheless very valuable. <br>  5. At this stage, all courses are free. <br><br>  <b>References:</b> <br>  Coursera (Stanford University + 13 universities) <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">www.coursera.org</a> <br>  Edx (MIT with Berkley and Harvard) <a href="https://www.edx.org/">www.edx.org</a> <br>  Udacity (Stanford University) <a href="http://www.udacity.com/">www.udacity.com</a> <br><br>  <b>Monetization:</b> <br>  Details of monetization are not disclosed, but apparently - this is the passing of full-time exams.  Given that a single course listens to a huge number of students, the cost of the exam can be quite small, about $ 5.  At the same time, in some interviews the amount of $ 150 for undergraduate is announced. <br><br>  <b>Statistics and figures:</b> <br>  1. More than 50,000 people enroll in popular courses.  Following the link is a variety of statistics on the course Gamification (63 000 students) <br>  <a href="http://wharton.qualtrics.com/CP/Report.php%3FRP%3DRP_bdNmp41YUtu8naZ">wharton.qualtrics.com/CP/Report.php?RP=RP_bdNmp41YUtu8naZ</a> <br>  2. 15-20 thousand dollars is the preparation of one course. <br><br><h5>  And what about Russia? </h5><br>  At the moment in Russia there are only a few educational institutions that purposefully generate educational content (for example, the Siberian Federal University).  At the same time there is no one who would actually join ocw consorcium, that is, he sought to publish his entire educational program.  At the same time, such monsters as St. Petersburg State University and Moscow State University occupy a wait-and-see position, generally not launching distance education. <br><br>  In addition, there are several resources that either try to aggregate the content published on the network ( <a href="http://univertv.ru/">Univertv.ru</a> ), or create their own online university ( <a href="http://intuit.ru/">Intuit.ru</a> ).  But for high-quality aggregation a very painstaking classification of content, its post-processing is required. <br>  And to create your own online university, you need to completely rework the lecture material.  Both are very laborious and expensive.  In fact, universities are not yet interested in such projects, and the business is ready to finance only that part of the area where there is a direct advertising of their own products.  For example, Microsoft courses to configure servers. <br><br>  All projects that tried to work with students and enthusiasts who generate and classify content themselves ( <a href="http://skillopedia.ru/">Skillopedia.ru</a> ) have shown their inconsistency.  The only project that is successfully developing precisely in the academic direction, including due to the fact that initially it worked only with universities, this is the lectorium. <br><br>  Do not think for PR.  I would love to write about someone else, but I don‚Äôt know anyone else.  If I'm wrong, correct it. <br><br><h5>  Lectorium </h5><br>  Our project <a href="http://www.lektorium.tv/">Lectorium</a> ( <a href="http://www.lektorium.tv/">www.lektorium.tv</a> ) has been developing OCW ideas in Russia since 2009 and has achieved quite good results. <br>  As a rule, the initiators of the partnership are not the university administration, but specific professors who are enthusiasts who break through bureaucratic barriers.  And although they attract financial resources and sometimes equipment, due to the lack of a clear university strategy in this matter, we have to be content with chronicle lecture notes.  Additional materials are practically absent, lecture material is not prepared separately.  And also, surprisingly, the resulting content is practically not used in any way to promote the university brand. <br><br>  <b>What exactly are we doing:</b> <br>  1. We advise and help organize the entire publication process. <br>  2. We provide hosting and publishing platform <br>  3. We carry out video shooting and installation on paid and free of charge (in case we have capacities) basis.  In particular, over the past year <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/136558/">we have recorded over 1000 academic lectures</a> in St. Petersburg.  Mostly Computer Science. <br>  4. Preparing content for publication <br>  5. We advise on legal issues. <br><br>  <b>Unique experience:</b> <br>  1. We have created more content than any university in Russia <br>  2. We are able to work very effectively, as the project was initially financed with our own funds. <br>  3. Our resource is well-known in the field of mathematics and computer science, since initially we asked a high level of our content. <br>  4. We have a large and most importantly, a constant audience: 116,000 visits in the last month. <br><br><h5>  Summary: </h5><br>  I believe that large Russian universities urgently need to catch up on the lost and start generating educational content.  And it's best to use the concept of OCW.  Otherwise, we will lose promising students who prefer Western education. <br>  In addition, the most ambitious universities should launch their own projects like the Coursera and work out the technologies of mass distance education, the era of which will come in a few years.  First of all it is necessary to concentrate on applied courses.  For example, Computer Science <br>  Let me remind you that our potential audience is 400 million Russian-speaking population. <br>  The project Lectorium is ready to help at any stage of these undertakings. <br><br><h5>  Summary 2 (actually, a memo) </h5><br>  1. Create an open library at the university.  If the content is good, then it promotes the university brand and attracts the best students.  In any case, it improves the quality of teaching. <br>  2. It is possible to start projects on distance education only after the creation of the media library, since it is necessary to first work out the technologies and overcome the resistance of the teaching staff. <br>  3. It is almost impossible to create content for distance education from the content of the library. <br>  4. Find ambitious nuggets in the teaching environment and process the educational program with them, sharpening it immediately for remote delivery. <br>  5. Share content.  It is almost impossible to protect it, therefore it is necessary to place it independently on the most different platforms. <br>  6. You can not earn a media library.  No  You cannot sell access.  You cannot sell advertisements. You cannot sell lectures on DVD. <br><br>  <b>Approximate figures:</b> <br>  Pilot launch of OCW (8-10 courses) from 2 million rubles / year <br>  Pilot launch of distance education from 10 million rubles / year. <br><br>  <b>UPD 1.</b> <br><br>  In addition, within 2 weeks I plan to publish the following notes: <br><br>  1. About the features of video lectures <br>  2. Necessary equipment for recording lectures <br>  3. As we again recorded 1000 lectures and agreed with several new universities. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/162793/">https://habr.com/ru/post/162793/</a></p>
