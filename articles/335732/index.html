They do not always come true, because people participate in them, which breaks any guarantees.  Nothing ever goes according to plan.  Better improvisation. <br>  Elchin Safarli.  ("You were promised to me") </blockquote><br>  A social organism, like any other organism, requires resources for its maintenance and development.  Therefore, it is not enough just to create such a community, it is necessary to look after it with zealous constancy.  First, for his well-being and the first uncertain steps, then for the fact that it itself did not offend anyone and you were not ashamed of him, after that no one would take him away from you, beckoning with ephemeral feelings.  Ideally, I would just like to contemplate how it itself takes care of you, supporting and not giving offense.  Therefore, the more the architect laid in the Social Organism, self-regulation mechanisms, which were discussed in the previous chapter, the more time he can devote himself, and not to nurse with his brainchild. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  1. Selection of participants necessary for the Social Organization </h3><br>  The main asset of the Social Organism is undoubtedly people.  After all, they are to a greater extent determine the fate of the community, ensuring the implementation of all functions of its life.  So, in the Social Organization there should be a sufficient number of participants capable of supporting these activities.  And here it is important to take into account two points: first, it is necessary not only to support the functions, but to do it qualitatively, and secondly, it is very important that the duties and responsibilities of the participants should not be theirs, because we declared the goal: to provide the inhabitants of the community comfortable stay in it.  And therefore, it is advisable to take care that the performer of each function in the Social Organization in its parameters as best as possible is suitable for the respective type of activity. <br><br>  What are the criteria for this selection?

      Various classifications of roles in the community can be found in S. Kratochvil, R. Schindler, M. Belbin.  Some rely on the leadership qualities and attitudes of the participants, others are repelled by group processes.  I, on the basis of the functions that were formulated in the previous chapter, singled out these most important roles (and determined their useful qualities): <br><br><ol><li>  <b>Zhivchik</b> (Initiator) - has leadership qualities, organizes joint activities of community members in finding and working out solutions to problems; </li><li>  <b>Idea Generator</b> (Designer) - has the creativity expressed in finding solutions to problems in various situations; </li><li>  <b>Own person</b> (Communicator) - possesses communicative abilities, expressed in building horizontal communication links between community members. </li><li>  <b>Auditor</b> (Controller) - has administrative skills, expressed in monitoring the correctness of the functions and compliance with the norms of community behavior on the part of the participants. </li><li>  <b>Authority</b> (Moral Benchmark) - has authority that influences the choice of criteria for standards of conduct that should be followed by community members; </li><li>  <b>Quartermaster</b> (Providing conditions) - has entrepreneurial abilities aimed at creating comfortable conditions for the successful functioning of the community; </li><li>  <b>The driver</b> (Stimulator) - implements methods of encouragement and punishment in relation to the community members, as well as in creating a favorable psychological atmosphere in the team; </li><li>  <b>The horn box</b> (Information Agent) has communicative skills expressed in collecting and comparing different opinions of other members of the community on emerging issues.  Forms an opinion about the ‚Äúaverage temperature in the hospital‚Äù; </li><li>  <b>Performer</b> - carries out activities in the context of generally accepted community decisions, meanings and values, adhering to the behavior adopted in the team; </li></ol><br>  Most often, participants perform several roles in the Social Organization at the same time. <br><br>  The next step is to allocate these roles logically to the functions we considered earlier: <br><br>  Table 1. Distribution of functions by roles <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/28d/7c9/1f7/28d7c91f71444eb99a32e43c0f445d66.jpg"><br><br>  Accordingly, if a function in a social organism is important enough for its vital activity, the community architect should take care of attracting a participant to the team who is capable of implementing it qualitatively. <br><br>  The Creator of the Social Body can either select the participants himself or implement one more function in it ‚Äú9.  Attracting community members to realize their vital functions ‚Äù, which also helps the Social Body to self-regulate.  The fact that there is a need in the community for people to perform certain duties and solve a certain range of tasks, we began to discuss in detail, even when considering the section ‚Äú2.  Reducing the stress of a Social Organism when a participant leaves. ‚Äù <br><br>  In the selection of people with the necessary qualities can help the personnel service of the organization, when submitting to it the appropriate application with specific requirements for the applicant.  In this case, the function of the Social Organism will be supported by the administrative and management functions of the Organization. <br><br>  I deliberately did not immediately include this function in the original list, because: <br><br><ul><li>  I would like to illustrate with an example that the requirements for new functions may arise already in the process of community activity; </li><li>  for a clear understanding of the principles of selection of community members, it was first necessary to describe all the basic functions of his life. </li></ul><br><h3>  2. Increasing the value of a social organism </h3><br>  As shown in the example in the previous section, during the life of the Social organism, it may be necessary to introduce new functions that contribute to its development.  These needs should be comprehensively analyzed, their importance should be evaluated and, if possible, a plan of measures for their implementation will be developed. <br><br>  Each implemented function must be really useful and bear clear benefits from its use.  I, for example, recently discovered that my head shampoo, the use of which, judging by the label, should protect hair color.  I washed my head, looked in the mirror, really part of the hair remained gray, some remained dark, as they were before using shampoos - the promised function was completed, the hair color was preserved and there seemed to be no complaints, but I subconsciously feel some kind of trick. <br><br>  Each successful introduction of a new function should increase the efficiency of community activity.  Thus, purposeful improvement and development of the Social organism enhances its value within the Organization in which it functions, and as a result, the value of the Organization itself as a whole.  The trick of the Social organism is precisely that the ratio of its price (value) and value (utility) is incommensurable, in favor of value, of course. <br><br><h2>  V conclusion </h2><br><blockquote>  I'm trying to free your mind.  But I can only point the door. <br>  You yourself must go free <br>  Morphius (Film "The Matrix") </blockquote><br>  In this article, I set out my point of view on how to design a tool to raise the production potential of a team of like-minded people to a qualitatively new level, as well as ensure its stable functioning and development.  Then I gave an example, a plan of measures for the materialization of this tool in life.  In this work, using the techniques of system analysis, I collected, systematized and laid out "on the shelves" of the information that is available on the Internet to everyone.  But unlike most of the primary sources that I used, in this study I followed the path of initial identification of needs (problems), and already, in the light of their analysis and analysis, I selected the appropriate solution. <br><br>  In the article I just focused on the important aspects of the aforementioned tool, without detailing the causes and nature of their existence.  For the most inquisitive, the text has references to literature in which more detailed information can be found about it. <br><br>  In this way, you can design not only the community aimed at supporting the production enterprise, but also for example: a charitable foundation, political force, a startup, a student team, a society promoting a certain product, etc. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/335732/">https://habr.com/ru/post/335732/</a></p>
