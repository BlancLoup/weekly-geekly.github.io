If you have a head on your shoulders, you can achieve a lot.  There is also enough work, even now, when there is a crisis in the yard.  The main thing is to strive, and everything will work out! <br><habracut><br><h4>  How to start </h4><br>  First you need money.  You need to live somewhere, eat something, it all costs money, which you should have at least for a couple of months while you are looking for work and get your first salary. <br><br><h4>  Housing </h4><br>  Inexpensive one-bedroom apartment on the outskirts of Moscow costs about 20,000 rubles.  It can be cheaper, but the conditions will be bad and a great chance that you will be thrown.  In order to rent an apartment, you need to prepare at least 2.5 apartment costs (20x2.5 = 50.000 rubles) - the landlord will take for 1 month and for the last (to insure), plus the agent who will find you an apartment, will need to pay another 0.5-1 cost of the apartment.  You can bargain with the agent (usually all require 1 cost, but can be reduced to 0.5), as with the apartment owner (knock out the best conditions - for example, buying a washing machine, microwave, reduce the cost by 1-2 tr.).

    <h4>  Nutrition </h4><br>  Food in Moscow is more expensive than in other cities - this is due to the level of wages (here it is also higher), but there is one trick.  The most expensive are small private stores, followed by supermarkets (Ramstore, etc.), and the cheapest (and at the same time high-quality) hypermarkets (Auchan, Ikea, etc.).  It is in the latter that I advise buying - save from 30 to 200% on products.  It is enough to go there once a month and buy everything you need (milk, eggs, meat, fish, cereals / pasta, canned goods, etc.), and in supermarkets to buy perishable foods - bread, dairy products, etc. <br>  In order to estimate how much to put on food, calculate how much you eat on average per month, calculate the cost, for example, in the <a href="http://utkonos.ru/">"Platypus"</a> and multiply by 2 months. <br><br><h4>  Job </h4><br>  There is a lot of work in Moscow, the main thing is to know where to look.  First of all, you need to search on the Internet - register on popular workSites (www.job.ru, <a href="http://www.jobster.ru/">www.jobster.ru</a> , <a href="http://www.rabota.ru/">www.rabota.ru</a> , etc.), pay special attention to the summary - it should clearly and clearly reflect your professionalism.  You don‚Äôt have to write any ‚ÄúI love computer games‚Äù, write as a matter of fact, do not forget to describe your professional experience.  After the publication of the resume do not expect that you will be filled up with vacancies - under a still stone water does not flow.  Start looking for employers on these sites, and when sending your resume, modify your resume for each employer.  For example, it is indicated that a C # developer with experience in database administration is needed - it means in our resume we focus on these skills. <br><br>  <b>When choosing a job, consider the following:</b> <br>  1. Contract.  It is necessary to draw up an employment contract - this is a guarantee that you will not be "thrown".  It must contain your salary, your work duties and working conditions.  If the employment contract is not executed - write it yourself in two copies (examples in Google), print, sign and leave 1 copy at home. <br>  2. Clearance by TK, white salary.  I strongly recommend choosing companies in which white salary and clearance in TC, even if they offer a little less (-13%) of money.  Because  A white salary is a guarantee that you WILL RECEIVE MONEY.  You also need to ask about compulsory medical insurance (without this, no white stone clinic will not accept you for free), paid vacation (according to the law should be 4 weeks a year) and paid sick days. <br>  3. When applying for a job, look closely at your future supervisor and his relationship with subordinates - he will treat you as well. <br>  4. Working conditions.  How ‚Äúfresh‚Äù the equipment is, whether the room is spacious enough, whether the tables and chairs are comfortable, the presence of air conditioning.  You should also pay attention to food: whether the dining room or a place for eating (equipped with a refrigerator, microwave, electric kettle). <br>  5. Ask about what you will do, see the projects. <br>  6. Specify the possibility of career growth, increase in salary and possible bonuses / bonuses / 13 salary / vacation. <br><br><h4>  Relaxation </h4><br>  In Moscow there are a lot of places where you can relax.  You can simply stroll through one of the many parks or reserves, go to some exhibition (for example, a computer :)) or a museum.  Of the more earthly entertainment there is a cinema (ticket 150-350 p. On average), theaters and clubs.  You can show your imagination and take a ride on a river boat (prices are fairly affordable) or remove a smaller boat in Gorky Park.  In general, there is a place to relax :). <br><br><h4>  Girls </h4><br>  I will not reveal the secret if I say that in Moscow there are a lot of beautiful girls.  The main clusters are observed in places of mass recreation and large shopping centers (Evropeisky, Manezhka, almost the entire center). <br><br><h4>  Transport </h4><br>  You can get to your favorite job or home from a nightclub by ground (buses, minibuses, trolley buses, trams), underground (subway) and expensive (taxi, bus) transport.  The metro is open from 5:30 am to 1 am.  Ground transportation is also about.  In order to save money, it is recommended to buy tickets :). <br>  If possible, it is better to rent an apartment closer to work - so less time and money is spent on the road.  If you work in the center - then it makes no sense to shoot in the work area, it is better to take it away from the center (cheaper, better atmosphere, you can get to the center in 30-60 minutes). </habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/60779/">https://habr.com/ru/post/60779/</a></p>
