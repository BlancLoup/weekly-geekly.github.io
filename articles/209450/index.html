  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The future of IT within companies: less, better, cheaper</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> The reason for writing this article was a few recent and unrelated events in my life.  First, an optical fiber was laid in my house and I was able to connect to the Internet at speeds up to 350 Mb / s.  After that, I thought about how much hard disk I need in order to store home content ‚Äî documents, travel photos, movies, and music.  This thought, wandering through the nooks of consciousness, resulted in the question - should I buy a hard drive home if I have a high-quality, stable and high-speed Internet connection?  And all my devices, mobile and not quite, have the ability to connect to the Internet at any time.  It may be easier to use the service of cloud storage, of which nowadays divorced for every taste and budget? <br><br>  I never chose the cloud storage service, but my thought, continuing to stray, sowed seeds of curiosity on its way that sprouted curiosity ‚Äî how many companies ask themselves the same question? <a name="habracut"></a>  Why should they buy servers, storage, routers, search and equip a special room for all of this, pay for electricity, buy and pay for support of system and application software, hire a staff of IT specialists to support and maintain all of this, budget funds for permanent expansion and updating aging equipment, etc.  etc?  Instead of all this costly fuss, you can simply connect all workplaces to the Internet and use the services of cloud service providers that offer the most diverse range of services, ranging from using the infrastructure of a cloud provider to using a full-fledged ERP system.  After researching this issue, I received some facts and figures that I wanted to share with you to further discuss the prospects for using cloud services to reduce IT costs. <br><br>  To consider the advantages and disadvantages of using the services of cloud providers in an integrated way, you must first understand the role of information technology in modern companies.  For me it seems strange approach, which is used by some people working in the field of information technology.  They pose the question as follows - What business can give information technology?  - and after receiving the answers, they begin to adjust all business processes to one or another model of using information technologies.  Correctly this question should sound like this - What information technology can give a business?  I think that no one will argue with the fact that information technologies have taken the position for which they were originally created - business support, or rather, automation of business operations + collection and storage of information about business operations.  Despite the complexity and seeming scientific nature of modern information technologies, they perform a completely ordinary, utilitarian function.  From this point of view, they are considered by the business - information technology is not a tool for profit, but a way to reduce costs in one way or another.  Considering the information technology in this paradigm, we soon come to the realization that IT cannot provide a competitive advantage to modern companies.  Very simple: using IT we will not be able to increase production and sales so much that it will allow us to overtake competitors.  <i>A small footnote: in addition to a couple of areas, for example, robotics and data analysis, where IT still occupies an applied role.</i>  The dotcom crisis clearly showed us this.  But we can reduce costs, and therefore the final price, relatively simply.  It is absolutely clear that almost any modern business needs information technologies, without them it will not be able to achieve a sufficiently high level of organization and will be mired in chaos and confusion.  This is a matter of course, which is taken into account in the conduct of any business, however, just as they take into account rental of premises, electricity, water, etc.  A small explanation: business is still understood as the real sector, and not financial speculation on the stock exchange, Farm Frenzy, facebook and other parasitic tinsel.

      More and more owners of small and medium businesses are looking at information technology as a public service, and not as a necessary part of the business.  This is especially true of the newly opened business, as well as small and medium businesses, where there is a need for basic infrastructure and / or standard office programs that ensure the implementation of simple business processes.  By 2016, more than 75% of all new IT costs will be associated with cloud services, more than 70% of CIOs will consider the transition to a cloud-based solution a strategic task No. 1, and more than 80% of IT decisions will be made together with business leaders - these are prospects for the development of the cloud services market (data from SAP in December 2013).  Indeed, every business owner experiences sharp signs of choking when looking at the bill for the content of servers / server and bearded sweaters.  Even greater sadness overtakes him when he realizes that all this falls on capital expenditures, you have to pay for support, the equipment becomes obsolete with time and fails.  Therefore, when he faces a choice between one person in a suit, who at the end of each month comes to him with a bottle of French brandy and an invoice for IT services or an entire department with incomprehensible people who need to be registered in the state, pay wages, provide jobs plus a dedicated server room with air conditioning, racks, servers that consume electricity at the speed of a huge iron that never turns off, then he, of course, is inclined to choose a pleasant young man in a suit.  At the moment, this is not the dominant situation in the IT market, it cannot be called mass either, but the trend clearly shows that the infrastructure part of IT will move to the clouds.  The long-standing forecasts of cloud technology apologists who predict the mass migration of companies to the clouds are beginning to look not so fantastic and divorced from reality as they seemed to me until very recently. <br><br>  Parallels published in November 2013 the second annual survey of the cloud services market in demand among small and medium business (SMB) companies in Russia.  According to the company, for the year the total volume of cloud applications and infrastructure consumed grew by 32% and amounted to 20.5 billion rubles.  ($ 633 million).  The most popular services were IaaS (7.8 billion rubles), SaaS (7.4 billion rubles) and solutions for web presence and web applications (4.2 billion rubles).  Decisions on the organization of collaboration and communications (1.1 billion rubles) are noticeably lagging behind in popularity, but at the same time they have the greatest growth potential among all cloud services.  By 2016, the market size will increase almost 2.2 times and reach 55.6 billion rubles.  ($ 1.7 billion). <br><br>  I will stay a little predictor and suppose that in 10-15 years from now almost all SMB companies will not have dedicated IT departments and departments, but will use public clouds.  The SaaS model that they will use is not as advanced at present as all cloud service users from the SMB sector would like, but after a few years, this cloud service model is adapted to the vast majority of businesses, taking into account the specifics of each specific business area.  The infrastructure in the SMB companies will be completely absent, and the widespread Internet connection will help realize the long-standing dream of mankind - not to go to work (here you mean work from home and BYOD).  After 5 years, the use of public cloud services will become a massive, surprising phenomenon, an indisputable fact, expressed in dry statistical figures.  The role of the CIO in the companies of the SMB sector will lose clear boundaries of power and responsibility, will become blurred and turn into a consultant.  Yes, and this consultant will not be needed everywhere, and will remain only in those companies that will use an extensive list of public cloud services from various providers.  In this case, the chief of IT for cymbals in SMB companies will be responsible for the integration of these services among themselves and interaction with various suppliers, i.e.  become an IT manager, generally without subordinates and a budget.  And what happens to the other people working in the field of IT? <br><br>  All infrastructure specialists, and these are system administrators and network salespeople, migrate massively from warm, small and cozy offices to huge data centers.  There they will settle in warm control centers, go through ITIL's Tao and learn Zen ITSM.  Iron is enlarged and transformed into standard cubes (as an example of a trend - IBM PureX System), protocols and interfaces are becoming more standardized, virtualization becomes the norm and the law, mega-clusters appear, fault tolerance becomes comprehensive and mandatory.  The unification of public services cannot be absolute, and in any case will require some kind of customization and perhaps the development of specific functionality for individual clients.  This means that all the variety of roles involved in the development of client software, and this business intelligence, system analysts, application and system architects, technical writers, developers, testers, project managers, etc.  will also move to the offices of cloud service providers.  That is why all the largest integrators are now building data centers that plan to use as a platform for providing cloud services and thus cease to be integrators, instead become a service provider, i.e.  become a service organization.  The difference here is fundamental - instead of selling equipment, software and implementation services, these companies will sell connection services to cloud services.  It will be in their interest to interest potential customers to connect and, most importantly, to continue using cloud services.  This, of course, greatly scares many integrators, because before that the sales model for them was based on the principle - they sold, considered the margin and forgot.  Thus, a full-fledged arrival of the cloud model will almost completely reformat the IT integration market in the world, only those who are able to offer a stable level of quality, which are free from prejudices of the previous generation and with good karma, will survive. <br><br>  Cnews has prepared a <a href="">map</a> where all these reserves and information technology oases will be located. <br><br>  At present, there is a tendency to the enlargement of data centers - the area, the number of racks and the input power increases.  Analysts rightly associate this with the growing role of the cloud model of providing IT services.  A huge amount of iron, which is now in the companies under the table, in the server and mini-TSODIKs will flow into the quality of giant, well-ventilated, robotic mega-TSOD halls that will act as locomotives for the transition from the industrial model of society to the information one.  Prospects are stunning in their horizons. <br><br>  Development in companies whose business does not relate to IT will remain in minimal quantities only in cases where it will really be necessary for objective reasons (for example, you need specific functionality that none of the public SaaS providers have).  Nevertheless, such companies will still remove their infrastructural burdens, preferring to pay the cloud service provider for using the resources of the PaaS model.  However, the number of such companies will be vanishingly small.  Everything that I described above applies to small and medium businesses.  But if you look at large companies, corporations and holdings, then we will see a very different situation. <br><br>  Large companies, as a rule, are companies with a history.  The composition of this story includes a huge number of a wide variety of information systems developed and developed at the present time.  Some of these companies are so large that no cloud service provider can provide for a reasonable amount of money that quality of service, which is implied by the nature of the activities of any corporation.  Despite this, large companies are also not alien to new trends and want to use cloud technologies in their business.  Immediately we must make a reservation that the main model for the provision of cloud services in large companies will be IaaS.  This is due to the fact that the provision of cloud services on the SaaS model implies the provision of a ready or semi-ready solution.  It is almost impossible to organize a full-fledged process of large-scale development / improvement of the information system in the form of a service, since  The customer for the development of new information systems and the revision of old ones is a business, and it is also often a business analyst.  The flow of these orders is constant, which makes it necessary to constantly make changes to the IS and maintain continuous dialogue with business users to check the compliance of the product being developed to the requirements of the customer.  At the same time, as part of the service, a limited amount of input and output information is implied, which is often not enough to implement the required functionality.  Based on this, it makes sense to consider the use of large cloud services by the IaaS model.  To understand why it is necessary for large companies it is necessary to understand that there are two types of IT activities in such companies.  First, it is operational activities to maintain the existing infrastructure - all cloudiness here consists in virtualization and optimization of the use of the existing infrastructure.  In fact, no service is needed here, but you just need to ensure that the requirements for performance and reliability are met.  The second type of activity is project activity, i.e.  the creation and development of new information systems for the automation of new business processes and business operations, as well as the refinement of existing information systems to meet new business requirements.  And here large companies have problems - for development purposes, it is necessary to quickly deploy several environments (development, various test environments, etc.) as a separate set of system and / or application software with specified computing resources.  It is not always possible quickly, upon request, to provide these environments to developers, as a rule, this is preceded by a long formal process with clarification of all the details.  On the one hand, a large number of projects and the relationship between them make them synchronize by release, but does not synchronize them by the time frame for using the infrastructure.  Since the duration of development is different for everyone and the development process itself is not always possible to determine by time, the infrastructure risks begin to have a big impact on the final release date of a complex information system with large internal and external relationships.  On the other hand, desynchronization by start and end dates of development and testing for different projects leads to the fact that the infrastructure is used inefficiently, the possibility of sharing infrastructure is not taken into account, the need for the required infrastructure is always higher and not true.  This situation provokes a constant postponement of releases due to the inability to take into account the needs of all projects at the same time and unreasonable infrastructure costs due to the inability to optimize infrastructure requirements.  The downside is that after the development and testing process is complete, the infrastructure resources are not always correctly released, and sometimes they forget to release them, which leads to inefficient use of the existing infrastructure.  This is a source of deaf business irritation regarding the infrastructure - they want to see a service that could quickly and cost-effectively, at their request, provide infrastructure facilities and, if necessary, quickly mobilize them for the most necessary needs.  The IaaS service model is the best fit for the business in this case. <br><br>  Moreover, there are all the prerequisites for the implementation of this model in large companies - all large organizations are trying to centralize their own infrastructure.  The reasons for this is that all companies are trying to get rid of an excessive number of disparate information systems, architecturally and platform integrating them by purpose and significance, centralizing in one place for manageability and monitoring, bringing the system and application software stack to uniform standards, unifying the exchange between information systems using a service bus.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This entails centralization of data centers, enlargement and reduction of their number by an order of magnitude, unification of infrastructure and total virtualization. These data centers will be privately owned by the company, which, however, will not in the least prevent the infrastructure units in large companies from separating themselves into a separate unit and will logically unite around the provision of the IaaS service. Simplified, this process will look like this - upon request of the projects all the necessary infrastructure will be ready within 2-3 days. Thus, IaaS sets the standard for the rapid provision of development and testing environments. The organizational infrastructure units will move further away from the business and lose the ability to establish the dependence of business and infrastructure needs, since these two parameters will be decoupled from each other.The subject of the dialogue for them will be the amount of necessary computing resources, a set of system and application software, requirements for the availability of information systems and data.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Numerous administration departments (network, system, databases, application servers, backup systems, PBX, etc.) will form an organic symbiosis with the data center, will be located around and at the same time over it, forming a kind of hemisphere, in the center of which there will be a data center. Project activities in large organizations will be a separate division where development will be carried out, mostly on their own, with the involvement of integrators only if the company has no own experience in this area - nothing will change here.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the Russian personnel market, the number of vacancies related to cloud computing in the period from 2012 to 2015 will increase by 158% to 162.4 thousand people. This is stated in a joint study of IDC and Microsoft, which gives similar estimates for other world countries. This does not mean the emergence of new jobs, rather the transformation of existing jobs and their assignment to the field of cloud computing. You should not deceive yourself that cloud technologies will ignite personnel shortage in the IT market - in fact, nothing new appears, transformation and consolidation of old, unchanged processes occur. You should not count on salary increase for specialists working in this field, since only a small part of the technologies related to the provision of cloud services are truly new.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A pleasant surprise for me was the fact that our state began to pay attention to new technologies and decided to think about using them. In general, our state has become more modern and enlightened, especially with regard to information technology. For only one program "Information Society (2011-2020)" can say a big thank you. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As I understand it, the state has far-reaching plans to build its own data centers and centralize all state information systems in them. This is indicated by the fact that the Ministry of Communications and Mass Communications on April 29, 2013 published a technical assignment for the implementation of research on the topic ‚ÄúRegulatory and legal support for the use of cloud technologies by state authorities and local governments‚Äù.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The document notes the growing popularity of cloud computing technologies and its advantages, and the department calls the transfer of government agencies and local governments to clouds promising. Inadequate regulation of the use of cloud technologies in the Ministry of Communications is called the main deterrent to their use in government agencies.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Ministry of Communications sums up that in general there is no regulatory legal act establishing the basic rules for the use of clouds, including requirements for service level agreements, etc. In this regard, the Office sees the need to prepare proposals and legal acts on the use of clouds in government agencies. To solve it, the research officer will have to analyze the benefits of using cloud technologies in government operations, including budget savings by reducing equipment costs and increasing the efficiency of using computational resources of the organization, a comparative analysis of existing cloud service models - SaaS, IaaS and PaaS and cloud deployment models. private and public, taking into account the strengths and weaknesses of each of them.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As a summary, I would not like to use banal phrases about the growing interest and maturation of the cloud services market. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In fact, I would like to believe that the format and capabilities of cloud services will really allow the whole society to be informational. </font></font><br><br> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It should be noted that all of the above applies to the subjects of the Russian Federation, where the culture of using IT is quite developed. </font></font></i> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The full Parallels SMB Cloud Insights study is available on the </font></font><a href="http://www.parallels.com/products/hosting-cloud-enablement/smb-report/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Parallels</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> website </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Gartner </font></font><a href="http://www.gartner.com/technology/reprints.do%3Fid%3D1-1IMDMZ5%26ct%3D130819%26st%3Dsb"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">IaaS 2013</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Report </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. </font></font><br><br> <a href="http://minsvyaz.ru/common/upload/proekt_TZ_po_oblachnym_tekhnologiyam_16_04_2013_zam.pdf"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Terms of Reference</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> for the implementation of research on the topic "Regulatory and legal support for the use of cloud technologies by state authorities and local governments."</font></font></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/209450/">https://habr.com/ru/post/209450/</a></p>
