In addition, we need to be aware of the problems that may arise within the framework of new trends (such as <b>social media</b> ) and the extent to which they affect the security of our corporate networks.

      All this leads to serious stress in enterprises when it comes to monitoring and managing information security. <br><br>  <b>What are managed security services?</b> <br><br>  Currently on the market there are new series <a name="habracut"></a>  products that position themselves as Managed Security Services.  They offer typical services such as antivirus, firewalls, intrusion detection, updates, content filters and security audits, as well as other services designed to meet new needs that businesses may have.  Such solutions are based on services operated by third-party companies that take responsibility for their operation and monitoring at any time. <br><br>  A study conducted last year in the United States, Britain, Canada and Germany showed that 74% of enterprises still used self-managed security systems, but 82% of IT professionals worked in companies (or thought about working in such companies) that provided security management services. <br><br>  <b>Advantages of managed security systems:</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Providers of such systems help mitigate the risks that are associated with <b>managing security</b> in an enterprise, so if you prefer their services, you can take advantage of a wide range of benefits.  The first, and most obvious, is the relative cost: managed security services, as a rule, are cheaper than investing in the appropriate personnel, software, and hardware. <br>  ‚Ä¢ The second advantage relates to attracting and retaining talented employees.  Currently, there is a shortage of personnel that specialize in cyber security, and this leads to an additional burden on <b>IT departments</b> , who are forced to retain trained and competent employees by all means.  And even armed with specialized personnel, solving some of these tasks can be a difficult process for some enterprises, but much simpler for providers of managed security services.  By highlighting such outsourcing tasks, a company can focus on more critical aspects of its business. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Such services also allow for round-the-clock monitoring, which not all enterprises can provide, since  limited by working time. <br>  ‚Ä¢ We can also see benefits in terms of the performance of security service providers: it is often difficult for enterprises to keep track of the emergence of all new threats and potential vulnerabilities, as well as be aware of all safety standards and tools.  On all these issues, security service providers are in constant contact with international experts, which has a positive effect on their know-how and response capabilities.  Moreover, since many of them have the opportunity to work closely with law enforcement agencies, this means that they have additional advantages when it comes to performing an expert analysis in the case of a court. <br><br>  <b>Adaptive Defense as a managed security service</b> <br><br>  Bearing in mind everything mentioned above, <b>Panda Security</b> decided to offer its self-managed security solution <a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/ukraine/enterprise/solutions/advanced-threat-protection/">Adaptive Defense</a> .  Thanks to the most advanced <b>cloud computing</b> technologies (based on machine learning techniques and Big Data) developed by Panda, <b>Adaptive Defense</b> is able to automatically classify all the running applications in the system without the need for any user intervention. <br><br>  <b>Adaptive Defense</b> is also a solution that has <b>zero impact</b> on enterprise infrastructure, since  is a centrally managed service via a web console that allows you to ensure the security of Windows workstations, servers, mobile phones and remote offices. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/268749/">https://habr.com/ru/post/268749/</a></p>
