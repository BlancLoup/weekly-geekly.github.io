  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Vspisok.ru - shopping list on your mobile</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  About a time in two weeks I raid the supermarket.  For products.  It so happened that during the last trip I forgot the list, carefully written by my wife on an A4 sheet of paper in a neat little handwriting.  Realizing this embarrassment, I called my beloved, said, so they say and so - they went smsku.  Joked, so to speak.  Joked and she - sent!  Nabila manually this A4 and sent! <br><br>  As it turned out, using a mobile phone instead of a piece of paper is much more convenient.  That evening I could not fall asleep for a long time, estimating the interface of the future site and reflecting on the existence of services that provide services for sending SMS.  And a week later we had a <a href="http://vspisok.ru/">website</a> ... <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I do not know how new this idea is - I have not studied the question.  It was interesting for me to implement such a task without regard to existing services. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

      First, it was necessary to find out the possibility of sending SMS from my site - several companies provide such services, they differ in price and quality: only in one of the five I found the necessary combination - sending a newline character to SMS and sending long SMS in one message. <br><br>  Next, I took the interface.  I wanted to make it as convenient as possible to fill the lists, without reloading the pages, with an autocompleted list of previously entered and standard titles. <br><br>  I also wanted not to burden the user by saving the list, but to keep it in the process of drawing up and give the opportunity to work without registering on the site. <br><br>  In addition to sending lists by SMS, a printout was naturally needed.  I had to break my head over the printout - everything on the sheet should have been compact enough to fit without breaking the sections of the list. <br><br>  The first users immediately submitted the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãaccessing the list from a mobile phone directly via the Internet.  A mini version was made for Opera Mini users and iPhone owners.  It is enough to log in from your mobile and you can see your latest list and archive of the previous ones.  In this case, the list items can be ticked. <br><br>  Actually, that's what's done: <br>  - convenient filling and editing of lists without reloading pages, with auto-complete lists (the main range of hypermarkets) <br>  - memorization of previously entered items and the ability to select them also from the list (that is, you can even enter the spare parts on the machine) <br>  - Sending a ready list by SMS (you need to replenish the balance with a paid SMS message) <br>  - sending to email (cheap and angry if the mobile phone accepts mail) <br>  - sending to print <br>  - access to lists from a mobile browser. <br><br>  Plans to add a field for the price - it will be convenient to estimate the tail to the nose. <br><br>  Speaking of a startup, we mean income ... But I didn‚Äôt seriously think about possible benefits, although I had to pay for sending SMS and theoretically you could benefit, but in practice the cost of an SMS is quite high - a 500 SMS package cost me $ 1.90  But these are standard SMS messages, in which only 67 unicode characters fit!  The minimum price from the selected provider is 0.75r when purchasing 10,000 SMS.  It turns out that a normal list with a size of 10 SMS (this is not so much as it seems - experiment on the site, where live calculation works) will cost 7.50 rubles.  And the ability to replenish the balance must be made the easiest way - sending a paid SMS.  At a cost of 25p, I get only 12p.  and accordingly only 12p.  I can write to the balance of the user.  And these are about two lists of 600-700 characters.  Little.  And if you write off the percentage of yourself - it will turn out even less.  I would not like this service.  Therefore, I still sell SMS as if for 0.75 and I do not leave anything to myself (advertising campaign) and just want to look at the relevance of such a service.  At least one faithful user has it for sure - it's me! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/27398/">https://habr.com/ru/post/27398/</a></p>
