According to the World Health Organization, 8 to 12% of the human population has diabetes.  We will not talk about hundreds of millions of patients - it is too difficult to visualize. <br>  Let's just say easier.  If we are talking about 8% of the population, then it is almost every twelfth.  If about 12% - this is every eighth. <br><br>  Now imagine that you are sitting in a cinema hall.  A row before you;  people in your row, to your right and to your left;  the row is yours.  So - just stretch your hand: forward, backward, right, left.  And you will stumble upon a diabetic.  This is what the penetration of diabetes into the human population means. <br><br>  If diabetes is not treated - scrupulously, every day and hour, he will kill the patient with a probability of 100%.  It can happen in five or twenty years after the onset of the disease - it does not matter.  It is important that there are no exceptions to the rule. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Sad but true: diabetes cannot be cured today.  But you can - compensate.  And not to allow the disease to take away from the person those years of life that she will definitely take if he does not work on herself, each day achieving the necessary compensation, and let everything take its course and hope for the great Russian "maybe." <br>  Diabetes mellitus is roughly divided into insulin-dependent and insulin-independent, or type 1 and type 2 diabetes;  they also distinguish a special form, which today is called ‚Äúnot I and not II‚Äù.  However, regardless of the causes and characteristics of diabetes mellitus, its compensation requires at least: <br><ul><li>  daily measurement of blood sugar levels at least 6 times a day and constant patient monitoring of a self-monitoring diary, which not only indicates blood sugar levels at certain hours, but also what was eaten, what exercise was, what insulin doses were administered; </li><li>  regular injections of insulin in diabetics of type I and type "not I and not II"; </li><li>  specialized drug therapy in type II diabetics; </li><li>  specialized diet therapy for all diabetics without exception; </li><li>  constant regular (often daily) medical advice. </li></ul><br>  In actual conditions, the current state of Russian health care in sufficient quantities and quality of all components of the treatment process, and especially the one that we designated as number 5, unfortunately, is often not possible.  Endocrinologists have an exorbitant workload, and in many cases they are only enough to prescribe patients for free insulin and test strips for blood glucose meters. <br>  How to fix the situation?  Now the impossible has become possible.

      Now, diabetics have a very intelligent assistant in their daily care for their health.  It is called <b>NormaSahar</b> . <br><br>  <b>NormaSahar</b> is an automated online patient tracking system based on smartphones and web servers that allows not only monitoring blood glucose and semi-automatically recommending insulin doses needed to compensate for the disease, but also organizing remote medical consultations for patients through the Internet and phone. <br>  Our methodical approach allows diabetics to keep their condition under control, not to start the disease and avoid the development of severe complications of diabetes, leading to disability and death.  Speaking in human terms: we give the sick time to live a full life.  And we provide the real quality of this life, and so, as without NormaSahar can hardly be achieved. <br>  In order to start using the <b>NormaSahar</b> service and a mobile assistant, you should register on the main page of <a href="http://www.normasugar.ru/">www.NormaSugar.ru</a> or <a href="http://www.xn--80aaa9begoeg5b.xn--p1ai/">www.NorSahar.rf</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b07/183/c93/b07183c93dd6f8ac95777417a5ba2833.png"><br><br>  When registering on the site, the patient will be asked to fill out a detailed questionnaire, meticulously describing his disease - a peculiar case history. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d45/c48/d71/d45c48d71bf91bd57b8c63ea782681ec.png"><br><br>  But, having done this once, you no longer have to repeatedly talk about your disease, as it happens every time you go to a doctor‚Äôs clinic, and every time your doctor changes.  At any time when consultation is needed, you just need to contact a qualified medical consultant from your smartphone, and at any time of the day, and the problems that arise will immediately begin to be resolved.  You no longer need to spend time and energy on the story of all the details again, because all necessary information about the patient's health is immediately available to the doctor. <br><br>  The mobile version displays "Active Insulin", "Blood Sugar", "Food", "Exercise", "Bolyus" (jolt) and "Hypoglycemia". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2cc/3e8/f94/2cc3e8f94d41f53095a08dd712df75c4.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e71/00e/062/e7100e062c0ca6ba3004702f277c7b90.png"><br><br>  The ‚ÄúActive Insulin‚Äù displays the amount of insulin that remains in the body from previous insulin boluses (jokes), and which has a hypoglycemic effect.  Accounting for active insulin can reduce the likelihood of hypoglycemia.  All this is calculated automatically, depending on the set parameter ‚Äúactive insulin time‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/89f/b62/cb2/89fb62cb2ce2d315f638f789433ce352.png"><br><br>  In the "Blood Sugar" section, you need to enter the sugar level, which was measured with a glucometer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/762/59f/f96/76259ff968bf0e1f93c528a8a4d01f9b.png"><br><br>  In the ‚ÄúFood‚Äù you can manually enter the amount of carbohydrates grams or XE (bread units), as well as using the ‚Äúproduct search‚Äù and ‚Äúfood categories‚Äù to quickly choose what was eaten (or just supposed to eat), while the number of grams is automatically displayed , carbohydrates and calories. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/752/8e8/e7b/7528e8e7bdbd5fe3a6ce7b9e0342ee83.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ada/2a7/e2c/ada2a7e2cd49a178e159c9b46f615438.png"><br><br>  In "Physical Exercise" you can specify the type, intensity and duration of physical activity! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/805/530/fa4/805530fa441f6cd6fcc0d95a2f726b86.png"><br><br>  In the ‚ÄúHypoglycemia‚Äù section you can mark your condition not only during hypoglycemia, but also to keep additional information - for example, ketones in urine, temperature, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a75/b02/6ec/a75b026ec77a2845c61b2cb84d8c5702.png"><br><br>  And now the fun part.  In the ‚ÄúBolus‚Äù section, depending on the prescribed treatment regimen, food consumed, exercise, and target blood glucose levels, the individual insulin dose will be calculated for the current situation.  And with an accuracy of 0.1 IU! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/64c/c76/a70/64cc76a70d232e8a44066dc3bf22a983.png"><br><br>  On the site, our patients can view all records made through the mobile version, reports, treatment regimen, and also soon consult with a specialist.  In the beta version, this opportunity is missing for a very simple reason - right now we are busy obtaining a license for medical activity for the NormaSahar Clinic, and as soon as it is issued, the advisory treatment work will begin the next day. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/618/ce0/68a/618ce068aa03979e6ecf9e65de1ee47c.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cb6/40e/f9d/cb640ef9d07b9fb23853f4dc6bdbf027.png"><br><br>  The <b>NormaSahar</b> system <b>is</b> unique.  It has no analogues on the Russian market.  In order to start using the <b>NormaSakhar</b> system, you just need to register on the website <a href="http://www.normasugar.ru/">www.NormaSugar.ru</a> or <a href="http://www.xn--80aaa9begoeg5b.xn--p1ai/">www.NormSahar.rf</a> and upload the mobile version of the <b>NormaSakhar</b> client to your smartphone on the Google Android platform.  IPhone OS and Windows Phone platforms will also be available soon. <br><br>  The <b>NormaSakhar</b> system was recently awarded a grant of $ 50,000 from the seed fund of Microsoft Russia.  <b>NormaSahar</b> is also a member of the Microsoft Bizspark program, thanks to which it has preferential Windows-Server hosting, access to free Microsoft development tools and, moreover, free licenses for Windows 7 and Microsoft Office on the developers' computers. <br><br>  <b>NormaSahar is</b> constantly evolving and improving.  In the 6 weeks that have passed since the system was publicly launched, the thirteenth version of the NormaSahar beta now runs.  Stay tuned for new features and improvements! <br><br>  You can help us develop <b>NormaSahar</b> and influence the development of the <b>NormaSahar</b> system!  Write your feedback.  Tell us what features you lack, what we can add to the system for you personally.  Just email us at <a href="https://normasugar.zendesk.com/anonymous_requests/new">support@normasugar.ru</a> . <br>  Feedback we need you like air.  More precisely, as insulin :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/142168/">https://habr.com/ru/post/142168/</a></p>
