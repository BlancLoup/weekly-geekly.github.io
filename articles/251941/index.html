Two disks of this particular model on the file server in less than a year and a half failed almost simultaneously. <br><br>  <b>Why did this happen?</b> <br>  A specialist in repairing machinery at our enterprise got to the bottom of the truth and asked him to tell about it in order to give recommendations to the manufacturer for the exclusion of such cases and advice to owners of disks of this brand.  To whom the tips will no longer help, they can use the HDD to make a three-byte gramophone. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/UAnxQ6AuAWk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhh1bAZyJqUWsiuls3qfqw1t8iuxWg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  "Hero of the day.

This is what is left on the table after disassembling it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ce8/55e/ec7/ce855eec7a6b41a0ad3e5933357f286e.jpg"><br><br>  Accessories: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1f4/713/4cc/1f47134cc34442588f73317b67a358b9.jpg"><br><br>  All photos can be viewed in the album <a href="https://plus.google.com/photos/116668088451857322516/albums/6120518464919314449%3Fauthkey%3DCPzr67O6wYGOkQE">"Seagate Barracuda ST3000DM001"</a> .  From the many pictures you can easily understand the design of the hard disk.  The article used only a small number of photos. <br><br>  Desert Storm.  This is what the ‚Äúmirror‚Äù disks look like - the result of exposure to dust and ferromagnetic particles that have come off. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e44/ac1/009/e44ac10096df42c0b3bd7bffd52910a7.jpg"><br><br>  An internal filter that must pick up random particles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/270/63f/1c4/27063f1c4e9f41829ad6f95e099ded87.jpg"><br><br>  The reason for the failure of the hard drive was <b>the ingress of dust</b> .  When working, a small amount of dust particles penetrates into the clean zone, causing initial damage, and then everything happens like an avalanche.  The difficulty was in determining where the dust penetrated, but logic and attentiveness do wonders. <br><br>  A metal platform in the upper right corner is used to attach a flexible cable and connector to the electronics board. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4fa/227/73d/4fa22773df324aec951f45ac4e7c4477.jpg"><br><br>  Electronics fee.  Two adjacent holes in the bottom right of the board - for the screws that press the contact pads on the board to the connector. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c30/12a/ae4/c3012aae45814bdcbddad27547d708f2.jpg"><br><br>  Electronics board dismantled.  Connector in the lower right. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/99a/205/b52/99a205b525f64067990b9371fceba57a.jpg"><br><br>  Removed connector. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/234/3c5/af0/2343c5af0f3b4221a551ab2a71318e78.jpg"><br><br>  In the right part, the thickness of the pad is increased by a flexible printed circuit board and a conductive ring with a thick layer of solder.  When attaching a platform with a train, there is a bias due to different thickness. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/89c/5fb/c49/89c5fbc49a414eb6a551f4104c54b823.jpg"><br><br>  As a result, the rubber seal on the platform is in contact with the body not around the entire perimeter.  The place of non-contact is perfectly visible under the microscope.  It is through this place that dust penetrates inside the disk. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b38/cd8/669/b38cd8669b834091af31656eaf59a6ea.jpg"><br><br>  <b>The manufacturer of</b> this site needs to be improved.  This may be an increase in the height of the seal or a change in material, leveling the heights of the site in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãattachment or other techniques. <br>  Judging by the <a href="http://market.yandex.ru/product/7776547/reviews">reviews</a> and the article mentioned above, we are not the only owners of the failed model.  Maybe hard drive manufacturers have a HDD recall program - like car manufacturers? <br><br>  <b>How to be the one who has already purchased this model?</b> <br>  Before starting operation, it is necessary to seal the side of the electronics board by filling the hole around the connector with a sealant.  It is necessary to fill in carefully and to a small height so as not to disturb the flexibility of the moving contacts.  The guarantee in this case is likely to suffer, but the life of the disc will last. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4e8/cf1/bf7/4e8cf1bf75e54210bd9a824e8b4882d5.jpg"><br><br>  <b>How to be someone with a hard drive began to crumble?</b> <br>  It all depends on the degree of wear.  If it has just begun, you can try to make a seal.  If the seal does not help, then you can make a three-byte gramophone.  The idea to use the disc in this capacity is not new, but the implementation with a horn and such a large volume has not yet been encountered.  If someone does not understand, then a 10 ohm coil located above the magnet (the two extreme contacts on the connector) is connected to the speaker as a speaker, and then it‚Äôs a matter of physics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/428/505/fb7/428505fb776649a49ea320dbe76f42e9.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dd2/239/bdc/dd2239bdc1e44efb943685338723d248.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bd2/d80/1b9/bd2d801b97e84f1eba49ab0efea0e3bf.jpg"><br><br>  Particularly "lucky" users who have failed two hard drives - they can make a stereo.  And those who are able to make a quad-system can only sympathize, since the cost of these four "speakers" is a significant amount. <br><br>  <b>PS I</b> looked at the discussion of the article in various places on the Internet ... <br>  1. About the dust.  The article does not state that all the dust inside the disk is external dust.  Most of them are ferromagnetic dust from the coating of pancakes of a hard disk - almost all the scattered dust was collected from the table using a magnet. <br>  External dust penetrating through the leakiness of the seal serves only as an initiator of the initial destruction. <br>  2. Reasons for HDD failure.  In our case there were only two drives, so it is wrong to conclude that the detected leakiness is the cause of the failure of all drives in this series.  Seagate engineers can tell the statistics for reasons of failures, but they are silent as partisans. <br>  A large number of disks is available in Backblaze and they <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/best-hard-drive/">note</a> that this series is special in terms of the number of failures, they promised to write a separate article about it, we are waiting. <br><blockquote>  The Seagate Barracuda 7200.14 3 TB drives are another story.  We'll cover how we‚Äôve spent in their future blog post. </blockquote><br>  Who does not believe Backblaze, can read reviews on the search ST3000DM001 - an anomaly occurs. <br>  3. Seal the connector with sealant.  If, according to statistics of failure reasons, the compactness leakiness has a significant proportion, then it makes sense to fill the perimeter.  Sealant must be neutral.  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/mixan/" class="user_link">mixan</a> used KPT-8 paste.  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/skyggedans/" class="user_link">Skyggedans</a> , if I am not mistaken, made it easier - from a rubber tube with a diameter of 12 mm I cut a ring about 5 mm high and put it on the connector.  After installing the board, the ringlet was sandwiched between the board and the case ‚Äî an additional barrier for dust particles.  In this case, the warranty is not exactly broken. <br>  4. It is desirable to have some answer about the reasons for such a mass unreliability of this series from the manufacturer, but there is complete silence.  In the case of the fall of rockets, airplanes, etc., it is customary to report the causes of the accident.  In our case, there is a massive failure of this series and no reaction, which is extremely strange.  This is detrimental to the manufacturer, since the stain falls on the whole brand, although only one series can be bad. <br>  While there are no official recommendations for the further operation of this series - to pass, change, fill, seal? <br>  5. Gramophone.  I repeat that this principle of sound reproduction from a hard disk is not new, but many people do not understand how sound occurs if the disc is not spinning?  Added an explanation in the description of the video on YouTube.  In general, the sound will be even louder if you move the magnetic head away from the disc, but with discs everything looks more organic.  If you make a beautiful mouthpiece, bring the disk into rotation at a low speed and apply additional pulses to the rotating coil, you can arrange the movement of the magnetic head on the rotating disk, which will add beauty during playback.  A good toy from the BU HDD. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/251941/">https://habr.com/ru/post/251941/</a></p>
