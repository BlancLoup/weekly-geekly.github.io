  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Physical economics for kids, part 3</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ec8/4b7/6bc/ec84b76bceaa49bb80569c9b962e80f5.jpg"></div><br><p>  We continue the cycle of articles ( <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/280952/">part 1</a> , <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/281182/">part 2</a> ) about how the work made a monkey Monkey.  Last time, we found out how the appearance of the Tool once again qualitatively changed the needs of the monkey.  The process of satisfying the need for labor tools produced by the monkey (including with the help of other labor tools) will be called Production. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  Production has an interesting feature, it is able to create new and new needs, since the next product or tool, satisfying all existing needs, ensures non-decaying, and often growth of the Energy Flow.  And often the product or tool produced creates new needs due to the objective properties of the product produced. </p><br><p>  Production in general can be represented as a system of transformation of matter through the commission of work.  At the same time, the Technical Power of the Monkey is limited by the value of the Total Power of the body and the MIND of the monkey and by a certain efficiency of the tools.  Moreover, the higher the technical capacity of the subject, the less time is required to perform the necessary work.  In this part of the energy is lost, which leads us to the concept of usable power. </p><br><p>  An indispensable part of production is the need to reduce production time, reduce loss, increase technical and total capacity of the subject.  The production process itself becomes cyclical, the rule of non-decreasing (in this case, useful power) with time also acts for it.  The cost of energy and time for new tools already in the next production cycle should lead to a significant increase in net power. </p><br><h2 id="myshlenie">  Thinking </h2><br><p>  In addition to the capabilities of the body, the monkey‚Äôs full power is determined by the MIND abilities of its brain.  Since the possibilities of the body practically do not change in adulthood, the UM takes all the care to increase the capabilities of the Monkey itself.  There is a process of thinking, as the process of finding ways to enhance the capabilities of the body and tools, which together will give an increase in useful power. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8d7/35a/1aa/8d735a1aac444018954ab42de167f2e0.jpg" align="left" width="40%"><br><p>  At the same time, not every product of Mind leads to an immediate strengthening of the Monkey.  After all, the flow of energy is determined not only by the quantity, but also by the direction of the flow, as well as by the time that it is spent on transfer.  Moreover, in the process of understanding the nature of the Monkey comes the understanding that there are far more powerful sources of energy than their own body.  Wind, water, fire. </p><br><h2 id="tvorchestvo">  Creation </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3bb/a52/f19/3bba52f193ed45be917f59cd4d7ef06d.gif" align="right"><br><p>  At some point, the variety of possibilities that the totality of products of production gives becomes so great that the UM moves from the chaotic activity of combining artifacts to purposeful Creativity, that is, the process of searching for new Ideas, images of future tools and products.  These ideas are implemented in the production process, thereby ensuring the development of all areas of the monkey's activities, which are directly or indirectly related to the new product. </p><br><p>  There is the ability to apply tools not only to matter, but also to the very flow of energy, change its direction (for example, convert water energy into rope movement), save energy (in the form of strained ropes, suspended loads, in the form of livestock).  All this becomes another way to enhance the useful power of the monkey and at the same time objects for further development. </p><br><h2 id="rech">  Speech </h2><br><p>  At the time of the appearance of the first guns in the Apes communication media (in particular, sound media), a separation occurred.  The part of sounds that was not intended for the exchange of information about biological processes was distinguished.  The means of working with information about tools inevitably became more complex following the complication of tools, and an increasingly complex sound form was required for the production process. </p><br><p>  To describe the tools themselves and the material world, the first set of words arose: the names of the Object Properties.  Further development of this set led to the emergence of the second set of words: the names of the sets of properties, that is, generalizing names, or Names of Objects.  This transition to operating with sets can be called the decisive stage in the formation of the ability of the UM to operate with generalized concepts, that is, to abstract, tear information from immediate reality, save it and redirect it to the mind of other Monkeys.  The concept of Images of Objects arises. </p><br><p>  Speech acquires Meaningfulness, that is, in every incoming Name of the Item, the UM forms in Mind an Image that can participate in the formation of new Ideas in the process of Creativity.  Conversely, if the incoming Names do not form an image, the speech seems meaningless, not related to a known reality (for example, foreign speech in an unfamiliar language). </p><br><p>  In the future, there appears also the Over-Speech, as a set of Images and Names that can be understood by any person, regardless of their language.  One example of such an Over-Speech is a mathematical language, in particular, concepts of countability and measurability, which are understood by Monkeys from all the paradises. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a58/d2a/292/a58d2a292a96480d83213c68a9c9f13a.jpg"><br><h2 id="chelovek">  Person </h2><br><p>  We reached the final of the monkey story.  During this time, the monkey has developed into a completely new creature, which with the help of the UM realized the presence of Energy Flows from Palma, learned how to maintain and develop these flows through their own efforts, thinking and tools of labor.  The constancy of the growth of the Energy Flow has led to a combinatorial growth of development opportunities.  The creative approach allowed the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcomplete control to be realized not only over the Energy Flow, but also over information about these flows, which led to the emergence of the Language as a universal means of sharing and preserving information. </p><br><p>  Simply put, Monkey became Human.  A living being with an irresistible desire for greater control over nature.  Man became not just the dominant view on the planet, in terms of total power, he became a living geological force. </p><br><p>  Palm in our simplified model is a huge flow of energy that endlessly flows of heat and light to the surface of the Earth and lingers here due to the huge reserves of water with good heat capacity parameters, due to the ability of living matter to bind energy, and of course, thanks to advanced human skills. </p><br><p>  It's time to say goodbye to the Monkey, further arguments about the physical economy will require consideration of not just the monkey with the family.  Man and mankind will come to replace them. </p></div>
