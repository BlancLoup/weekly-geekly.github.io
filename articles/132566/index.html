  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Android - new Windows</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On the eve of the release of the fourth (if we consider only integer) versions of the mobile operating system from a good corporation, I finally got together and bought myself an androidphone.  He added to the zoo from iOS and Windows Mobile 6 (so I have something to compare with).  Immediately after the purchase (as before, in general, it began) the development of gingerbread features, the traditional reading of forums and faqs, and, along with knowledge about features, weaknesses and software, the sense of deja vu grew. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  1. Viruses </h5><br>  I will not go deep into details, especially about viruses and threats for the android platform already wrote a lot on Habr√©.  The fact is that these are not viruses from the old joke about Linux that need to be configured via the terminal and run through the superuser (although yes, there is some truth in every joke - half of these viruses work or simply feel more comfortable on rooted devices where they are given more right).  And the worst thing (for me and for many ordinary users) is that there are viruses in the applications located in the market.  So even if you do not install applications downloaded from third-party sources, you should still be careful, intelligibility and the rest, familiar to us the rules of "computer hygiene", and try to avoid the applications, which will be discussed in the next chapter. <br>  <b>The result: there are viruses, there are many of them, <s>and they are among us</s> .</b>  <b>So it is desirable to have an antivirus and do not forget about caution.</b>  <b>Familiar rules?</b> <br><br><h5>  2. Useless and unclear why the necessary applications </h5><br>  <i>(In the first edition of the article, there was a long text on the topic ‚Äú100 reasons why I hate the android market and why I like Apple Appstore even more, but the post is not about that, so now it's not here)</i> <i><br></i>  Experienced users and just pedants are not new to search and install on 5-10 applications to understand which one is more suitable, whether it really does what is stated in the description, and whether it can do what it is put for.  On the android situation is exactly the same.  And here comes the next problem. <br>  <b>Bottom line: you will rewrite the entire market in search of the program you need, it would be good free, or at least with a human trial, with a description in Russian, or at least in English, and not in translated translation from Chinese.</b>  <b>And all that you find will have to put on your device to understand what it does and how it works.</b> <br><br><h5>  3. What does this file do?  (based only on foreign and subjective experience) </h5><br>  So, we downloaded 3 (4,5,6, etc.) applications displaying photos with kittens on the desktop (displaying battery charge, file managers) yes, we liked one thing, and we decide to remove the rest.  Will they be completely removed?  Will the program take care of itself?  I have come across arguments and evidence that the answer to these questions is ‚Äúno‚Äù, and that after some time, the file system gathers a collection of files of unknown origin and purpose, not related to the programs that are currently installed on the device. <br>  <b>Bottom line: once a year (and perhaps more often), you will have to format the memory card, since it is on it that a hostel of orphan data is formed so that the device‚Äôs ‚Äúlife experience‚Äù does not interfere with it.</b>

    <h5>  4. Barsik Fu! </h5><br>  I don‚Äôt even know what to write about this, except that everyone already knows perfectly well: the android and its applications crawl into the Internet at the first opportunity without asking for updates. <br>  <b>Bottom line: Keep your pet on a firewall leash.</b>  <b>And better in a muzzle.</b> <br><br><h5>  5. Yes, your hands just do not grow from that place ... </h5><br>  Android is considered a system with very large possibilities for tuning and debugging, and it is considered that if something doesn‚Äôt work for you or it doesn‚Äôt suit you, ‚Äúyou just don‚Äôt know how to prepare them‚Äù.  Although there is another point of view, they say, out-of-the-box functionality is enough for a normal user, and there are always maniacs who definitely need to get the root, overclock the processor, and manually edit the system files, and they will always be unhappy.  I agree with both these points of view, but since I also have an annual experience of using iOS and I have something to compare with, I, like any average user, will say: ‚ÄúHey, I don‚Äôt give a damn about (points 1, 2, 3 , 4 of this text), this is not such a big problem!  This is not a ‚Äúboring wallpaper‚Äù to you! ‚Äù. <br>  <b>Bottom line: even if you are not a technomaniac, it would be nice to tweak something, so as not to worry about anything at all.</b> <br><br>  I am very pleased with my phone, and now, when I know what an Android beast is, I can say with confidence that I don‚Äôt regret my purchase.  The reason for the appearance of this post is that when I, still unsure if I want to get involved with this platform, as always came to Habr, gain wisdom, there was no such post, and he would have been useful to me then.  I hope he can be useful to someone else, and will make it clear to those doubters like me that if they decide to ‚Äúlink their fate‚Äù with this platform, then they should know that the problems we are used to in desktop windows , can often be found here. <br><br>  PS I was waiting for an invite, or a refusal in it, and already started to think that there was too much pessimism and paranoia in my post, the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù client of one well-known social network changed my password, and my account became an advertising platform, so I became even more confident in his statements. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/132566/">https://habr.com/ru/post/132566/</a></p>
