Thus, ICO is becoming an increasingly common way to attract funding for technology start-ups. <br><br>  We continue to study the upcoming sales of tokens of IT projects, and in today's topic there are 4 more interesting ICOs of September. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h2>  <a href="https://privatix.io/">Privatix</a> - decentralized P2P VPN network with a market of communication channels </h2><br>  As more and more people around the world are connected to the Internet, the risks of network users are growing, as well as the interest of the public on them.  Governments, large companies and cybercriminals seek to take possession of information users, while the speed of information transfer on the Internet, in general, decreases - the content becomes "heavier", and the cost of its delivery does not decrease. <br><br>  The creators of the Privatix project are developing a decentralized P2P VPN network that allows you to switch between millions of entry points at the highest available speed.  For the organization of communication using a modified VPN-connection, which can not be detected even with DPI. <br><br>  If a member of a P2P network does not use his entire Internet channel, he may sell a part of it and receive payment in cryptocurrency.  Traffic is bought by other users of the system - this can be done directly or through third-party applications. <br><br>  Here is the scheme of the project: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/ee3/4d0/8fb/ee34d08fb13c4b54909829283eacebcf.png"><br><br><blockquote>  Pre-ICO project will begin on September 14: <a href="https://privatix.io/ru/">www.privatix.io</a> </blockquote><br><h2>  <a href="https://www.archain.org/">Archain</a> - parallel internet based on blockchain structure </h2><br>  The creators of the Archain project approach to ensuring the freedom of information exchange on the other hand - they plan to create a parallel Internet based on the blockchain structure.  It works like this: with a simple browser extension, users can copy their favorite web pages to this parallel Internet. <br><br>  This leads to the creation of a distributed web archive, which no government or attackers can edit in accordance with their goals.  No documents or information can be deleted after publication.  According to the creators of the project, its goal is to preserve the opportunity for ordinary users and researchers to study and analyze how society has changed with the help of network history.  The system works on a new blockchain-like data structure called blockweave, which allows you to scale the archive to enormous size. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gMs37uTBoK0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><blockquote>  At the moment there is a pre-sale ICO project: <a href="https://www.archain.org/">www.archain.org</a> </blockquote><br><h2>  <a href="https://kin.kik.com/">KIN</a> - monetization platform from the creators of the KIK messenger </h2><br>  The developers of the popular messenger KIK have announced the launch of a new project - a content monetization platform called KIN.  According to them, in recent years, communication services have become a very important tool for disseminating information, so the fact that only a few companies control this market (some of them also absorb competitors, see the Facebook and WhatsApp deal) cannot be called positive. <br><br>  This is facilitated by the fact that so far on the Internet, the most common model of content monetization is advertising.  According to them, this moment is partially explained by the spirit of the early stage of the Internet development, when it was considered ‚Äúnot comme il faut‚Äù to take money for the content.  However, later "this inevitably led to the fact that these same companies began to sell the attention and data of their consumers to advertisers and marketers." <br><br>  To combat this, you should create a new distributed ecosystem of digital communications and content monetization.  This is the main goal of the Kin project, which at the initial stage will be integrated with the Kik messenger itself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/0ee/c18/5e3/0eec185e340746fab89a45461950fda3.png"><br><br>  <i>An example of monetizing the system: the bot and the user are talking about what kind of pizza the user wants.</i>  <i>After the choice is made, the bot charges the user 12 Kin</i> <br><br><blockquote>  The ICO project starts on September 12 to take part in it, investors must register before September 9: <a href="https://kin.kik.com/">www.kin.kik.com</a> </blockquote><br><h2>  <a href="https://fundrequest.io/">FundRequest</a> - rewards for open source developers </h2><br>  Anyone who has used open source software has encountered a problem, when there is an error in the software, its presence greatly interferes, but the developers can get their hands on fixing it very soon.  The FundRequest service team decided to change this situation and create a tool with which users of open-source projects will be able to offer their creators and other developers rewards for fixing bugs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/bec/ebf/5f8/becebf5f879b4eebbd0086a1668c46c8.png"><br><br>  <i>The work scheme is simple</i> <br><br>  It works like this: faced with an error, the user (or the whole company) can declare a reward for correcting it.  Both developers and third-party programmers can do this - the main thing is that the user will get what he needs. <br><br><blockquote>  ICO project is scheduled for September 6, you can receive an invitation to participate after registration: <a href="https://fundrequest.io/">fundrequest.io</a> </blockquote><br>  <i>And what interesting future ICO do you know?</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/337094/">https://habr.com/ru/post/337094/</a></p>
