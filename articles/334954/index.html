Need a higher salary and various bonuses?  The market for your specialization is highly competitive, and do you feel that you have little chance? <br><br>  Many people, having learned about a suitable job, submit resumes and a cover letter to the company, wait for a call back or e-mail, and receive silence in response, or a polite refusal.  Someone carries more, they pass for an interview, after which they can also be refused. <a name="habracut"></a>  Most of the recommendations below apply to a telephone or personal interview.  You need to prepare for them long before sending a resume to your favorite job. <br><br><h2>  Collect company information </h2><br>  In preparation for the interview, you are interested in the personality of future interviewers, technology, equipment, salary levels, the overall reliability of the company, the processes inside it and financial results.  In addition to receiving information directly from HR, working for insiders, and during the interview, there are other ways to gather the necessary information, almost <sup>[ <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/334954/">1</a> ]</sup> without going beyond the law.

      <br>
      Find and analyze: <br><br><ul><li>  Resumes and technical blogs of employees or former employees of your future company;  Especially valuable information can be gathered from LinkedIn, profile forums, public repositories of software source codes, sometimes from corporate social network accounts;  Try not to leave traces, use fake accounts to view (especially on LinkedIn). <br><br></li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/echelon/blog/321754/">Information from personal blogs of</a> employees, such as the class and brand of cars, the availability of real estate, leisure venues and holidays, family composition - this will give information about the income class of employees;  Of particular interest is similar information about future hiring managers, whose names are not difficult to obtain from HR, asking who will conduct the interviews. <br><br></li><li>  Local forums or large user groups may give feedback on the employer, but treat the information received there with a bit of skepticism. <br><br></li><li>  Interviews with employees and analysts of marketing and news agencies published in the press (eg RBC / CNews / Gartner). <br><br></li><li>  Scan networks and company addresses, examine the headers of e-mails received from HR;  if you are a web developer, then it may be useful for you to know the frameworks used on the company's web services;  if you are a network administrator, then you will be interested in BGP peering, whois, and WiFi details with a self-service portal in the lobby;  system administrators are interested in service headers of published services. <br><br></li><li>  Previously opened vacancies of this company (eg google: // site: hh.ru/vacancy/ ‚ÄúVacancy in the archive‚Äù company_name) is one of the most valuable sources of information about the technologies used and current projects. <br><br></li><li>  Examine the available tender documentation - it often contains detailed descriptions of projects in which the company was a customer, or performer. <br><br></li><li>  View patents and licenses obtained by the company, as well as information about partners. </li></ul><br>  All this will give you information about the equipment used, services and software. <br><br>  The documentation published for shareholders will tell about the general financial condition of the company, about the remuneration of top management, about the salary fund of employees and their number, and other important data.  Access to the bases of legal entities (SPARK, etc.) will provide information about other related companies in the holding.  Well, in fact, you do not want to work in the "office" with a share capital of 10,000 rubles., Which has signs of a one-day firm?  In the bases of enforcement proceedings, decisions of arbitration and courts of general jurisdiction, one can see problems in the quality of the company‚Äôs work and their problematic contractors. From the exotic, court decisions about reinstatement of illegally dismissed former employees. <br><br>  Do not forget about competitors, but do not spend on them a lot of time.  Having fluently studied their offers and products, you will get the opportunity to use this information as an advantage when selling yourself at an interview. <br><br><h2>  Interview </h2><br>  Try to secretly record audio for an interview.  Writing will help you understand your mistakes and weaknesses. <br><br>  Prepare in writing high-quality answers to standard interview questions: talk about current work and answers to typical behavioral questions.  Record and listen to your recording, responding from the sheet to these questions.  Change the text, mark it with additional pauses and interjections, so that you do not get the impression that you are reading.  Practice quickly navigate the text. <br><br>  Lie in the resume and on the interview.  Competently lie.  Use the collected information about the company and interviewers, creating the image of "your boyfriend."  Have you learned from social networks that HR is a cyclist?  - indicate in the resume in the hobby section that you run half marathons.  At the interview you will say that this is about 21 km, and in Luzhniki in August 2016, you ran them in 2 hours and 10 minutes.  Just do not overdo it.  The candidates who played the role of know-all and did not listen to me when I talked about the company and the position that came across to me at the interview were annoying.  We will not hire them, of course. <br><br>  White hacking is when you first find a problem in information security, and then you are offered a job.  Do not come for an interview with the results of white hacking, unless you are applying for a position as a <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/ua-hosting/blog/283022/">software tester</a> or information security engineer. <br><br>  Ask fellow friends to collect positional information at the interview.  Let them apply for the same vacancy with their own, or partially changed resume (someone else's name, changed last place of work, telephone, e-mail, etc.), and pass the interview, writing it down.  You will be able to get some information in advance that will help you better prepare for your interview: what and with whom you will have to work, what questions at the interview, what salary and bonuses are offered.  Act in concert, discuss the interviews in the circle of dummy candidates.  Encourage friends to show a high level of interest in a job interview, and remind them that they should show approximately your level of knowledge, not higher.  You can collectively prepare for the interview. <br><br>  It would be great if friends ask for a salary at or above the desired salary, and if they get a job offer, they will refuse with a reason indicating that the fork of the company's salary does not match the market (‚Äúreceived an offer with better conditions‚Äù), or neutral reason (‚Äúfor personal urgent circumstances‚Äù).  HR and a hiring manager may increase the budget for the position, or become more likely to accept your requests.  This technique has repeatedly led to a job offer with a salary much higher than the market. <br><br>  An alternative to helping friends can be independent reconnaissance, again under an assumed name and with a modified resume.  Buy a couple of good accounts in social networks is not a big problem.  Use also a separate SIM card with a separate number, and redirect to the virtual number of the SIP softphone or Skype to accept the call to the computer.  This will give you the opportunity to use voice change and call recording software (in combination with a virtual sound card).  Refer to a stuffy nose or swollen throat if the interviewer has any questions, but still try to pick up normal audio filters.  With fake accounts, you can contact the employees of the company and ask them to answer a few questions.  Infrequently, but some people are easy to contact, and give positive feedback.  Do not be fooled.  You can get more negative or more balanced reviews from former employees if you start a conversation with the phrase ‚ÄúI understand, there could have changed a lot, but would you tell me about ... &lt;past work experience&gt; ...‚Äù. <br><br><h2>  Work with failures </h2><br>  Waivers are written in universal formulations, following the principle ‚Äúif only a loser candidate is behind‚Äù.  Various hiring management software in the standard delivery comes with universal failure patterns that do not assist you in finding your mistakes.  You have HR's e-mail address.  Write to him a couple of lines asking why you didn‚Äôt pass, and ask for development recommendations from the hiring manager interviewing you.  Not often, but sometimes I get really valuable information. <br><br>  Sent in the letter with the refusal of the promise of HR to write to you, as soon as they have a position suitable for you - this is a lie.  Subscribe yourself to the newsletter of vacancies of the company you like, and do not be lazy to go, reminding about yourself.  Constant tracking of all published vacancies will give you a picture of the development of various activities of the company.  Who knows, maybe luck will smile at you another time. <br><br><h2>  After receiving the offer </h2><br>  Share your results with former colleagues and other interested parties.  Be sure to disclose the level of the proposed salary and other terms of the contract - this helps other potential employees to request and receive high wages.  In addition, it motivates them to look for a new job, and get a new experience. <br><br>  Do not forget that the trial period is not only for you, but also for the employer.  Notify the manager and HR in writing of all the shortcomings of the work, and even more so about attempts by the employer to default on the commitments made, whether they are enshrined in the contract, or have only been expressed at interviews.  When you write a letter of resignation from probation, you will have written evidence confirming the reasons for your action.  A company that has spent significant resources on the process of selecting candidates, hiring and adapting to the workplace can back down and will agree to fulfill these promises regarding working conditions. <br><br>  Do not stop searching for a new job.  Passing interviews to different positions, even if not quite close to your current one, you train the skill of interviewing, broaden your horizons, learn more about the labor market.  In addition, you warm up the market, raising the proposed level of remuneration, from which all employees in this field benefit. <br><br>  [one <a name="1"></a>  ] - in some countries, for example in the EU, you are obliged to inform that the conversation will be recorded;  in Russia there is no such requirement </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/334954/">https://habr.com/ru/post/334954/</a></p>
