I want to talk to you about the organization of the work network.  If you administer &lt;50 PCs and do not consider yourself an active administrator - you can safely pass by and miss what I will tell you.  Today we will not consider the issues of raising SQUIDs and other evil spirits.  Today we will talk about how important the expanded network administration tools are in life. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Once upon a time, in a galaxy far far away, I collided with such an outlandish beast of soft building as IBM Director.  Despite this terrible name, this software is free for all users of IBM servers and is a centralized server for managing servers (the most striking is any server if its agent is installed on them).  About this program, you can write very much, and if this topic is interesting to a respected community, and someone is not too lazy to unsubscribe in the comments to this article or even write me a mail - I will do a more detailed review, since I have enough experience with it is rich.

      In those days, I was not yet a system administrator, but I was an ordinary engineer, but the dark side of power already attracted me and I slowly collected information that could be useful to me in the future.  And I was struck in this software by the abundance of modules for managing not only servers, but also ordinary PCs borrowed from the older brother of their IBM Tivoli.  So I began to plunge deeper and deeper into the depths ... <br><br>  In the process of exploring this strange beast, I learned a lot of new and interesting.  It makes no sense to bring everything, I think you know it yourself, and if you don‚Äôt know, again I just need an excuse to write you what rules to my incorruptible opinion are most important when building a local network for small and medium businesses. <br><br>  IBM also offers us such business solutions as (I will leave comments on each decision along the text. They will be <i>in italics</i> ) <br><br>  Tivoli Identity Manager Express <br>  A tool to help manage passwords, user accounts, and access permissions. <br><br>  <i># I was immediately alerted by this statement.</i>  <i>I think it‚Äôs no secret to anyone that most local networks are built on a win basis.</i>  <i>And the meaning of this application after setting up AD and domain correctly is not very clear to me, but maybe there were special reasons for this?</i> <br><br>  Tivoli Monitoring Express <br>  Management and monitoring solution that is easy to install and implement and convenient to use. <br><br>  <i># In this sentence I was struck by a paragraph on the <a href="http://www-142.ibm.com/software/dre/ecatalog/detail.wss%3Flocale%3Dru_RU%26synkey%3DU668784M63112N16">page describing this application</a> :</i> <br><br>  Fast return on investment thanks to an interface that is easy to install and implement and is convenient to use;  This interface will help develop information technology to meet the needs of your enterprise. <br>  <i># How, I thought, is it really possible to save thanks to the interface?</i>  <i>This is what a coup =) This is how much money is ..</i> <br><br>  In general, a lot of nonsense is written there, and I will not take your time, rewriting it into the pages of Habr.  It is better to immediately draw your attention to the products that interested me.  So they became * drumming *: <br><br>  Tivoli Configuration Manager <br>  Integrated solution for the implementation of distributed software and control the configuration of hardware and software. <br><br>  Tivoli Provisioning Manager Express for Inventory <br>  Provides inventory management;  collects and stores information about hardware and software and resources, and manages this information. <br><br>  Tivoli Provisioning Manager Express for Software Distribution <br>  Distributes software applications and patches, ensuring the safety and security of personal computers. <br><br>  <i># It seems to be quite an important and relevant thing.</i>  <i>At once I want to note that these actions can be performed without this software, but the cenralization is good.</i>  <i>But I was a little embarrassed by the fact that all this is available in the free IBM Director.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Vopsche as something curious goes: we offer to buy what can be done and so and in general - get for free.</i> <br><br>  I looked at it all and thought: I don‚Äôt want to buy anything ... If I have a Windows domain with AD, if I have a centralized antivirus, if I have an IBM Director, I can‚Äôt even think what I need more ... But if you,% username%, know something that I don‚Äôt know, tell me about it, and I will be grateful to you =) <br><br>  By the way, I almost forgot: 42 <br><br>  <b>Upd.</b>  Dear, is it worth it to add pictures comparing the interface of similar functions in IBM Director and Tivoli? <br>  <b>Upd.2</b> Pictures - to be.  If you wait some time and go back to this page - you may already see that this comparison is =) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/46607/">https://habr.com/ru/post/46607/</a></p>
