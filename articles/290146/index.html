  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Moral aspect in venture investments</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Venture investments at first, and very unprofessional, are a lot of risky, young investors.  For them, traditional finances are boring and do not cause anything but neglect.  In fact, the venture attracts a lot of different characters, ranging from the hardened money bags, and ending with the young fledgling gentlemen. <br><br>  Here on the mega brain, we often write about the venture in general and in particular, but I am afraid that the topic of morality has never been touched upon to the extent it deserves.  And in vain.  In this regard, I would like to give a clear example of a rather unsightly venture.  I must say that I did not find this interesting exhibit, but Yevgeny Valentinovich. <a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a71/bae/783/a71bae78311743298c426f48cb1cb78d.png" alt="Kaspersky" align="left">  In his article <a href="http://eugene.kaspersky.ru/2015/04/27/venchurnyj-gop-stop/">‚ÄúVenture's gop-stop‚Äù,</a> Evgeny Valentinovich notes the special approach of these venture capitalists. <br><br>  These wonderful people came up with the option of investing in "patent trolls", with which Kaspersky recently often seized in hot trials.  The fund he recently discovered, Bentham IMF, finances various entertaining people in the hope of making a profit from winning low-risk patent cases against wealthy victims.  Each of these cases can bring at least $ 10 million in payments.

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

      <br>
      The fund invests from $ 1 to $ 10 million. Considering that, according to US law, ‚Äúpatent trolls‚Äù pay nothing in case of loss, and the average percentage of winning or settled cases with the defendant paying some compensation makes up 99%, this is practically a guaranteed venture capital scheme!  Here is such a beautiful scheme with an almost one-hundred-percent opportunity to earn money.  Such a system discredits the US patent system at the root.  And many interested parties have long been trying to draw the attention of those in power and legislators to this. <br><br>  Similar, dishonest, businessmen even try to substantiate the ideological background of their business.  Here, as official justification for such extortion, they sign support for the law, justice, and punishment for vile violators. <br><br>  Evgeny Valentinovich can understand.  The rage on permanent attempts to squeeze a little denezhek from his rather successful company in the West is not groundless.  Moreover, the time and money spent even in the event of a victory over the trolls are not returned, and could work on upgrading and improving the product.  And in the end, the user is still the most extreme, the costs of legal costs are still included in the price of the product.  Meanwhile, comrade-hungry comrades invent patent aggregators, and today even the venture has come into this sphere. <blockquote>  Yevgeny Valentinovich is surprised: ‚ÄúYou are not interested at all what will happen to real innovative and technological companies?  After all, every dollar spent on protection against pseudo-patents is a minus dollar in the development of industry and society as a whole!  And this is tens of billions of dollars a year.  Maybe it's better to fly to the moon?  And the good is more :) " </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b7b/6b8/c12/b7b6b8c12b474a3bab6a1025ca3e08ad.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290146/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290146/</a></p>
