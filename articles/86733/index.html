  <section class="page js-page"><h1>RiAA says: music pirates steal money from the Haiti charity foundation</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Initially, the single ‚ÄúWe Are The World‚Äù was released in 1985 and was recorded by many famous musicians with the aim of raising money to help Africa.  It was the first single in the history of the music industry, reaching the title of multi-platinum (more than two million sales);  with his help, millions of dollars of charitable aid were collected. <br><br>  Now a new group of musicians decided to repeat this success today and recorded ‚ÄúWe Are the World 25 for Haiti‚Äù;  the goal was to raise money for victims of the devastating earthquake in Haiti. <br><br>  Although most people understand that donating money directly to the Red Cross organization more efficiently and reliably, there are still enough people who buy charity CDs.  However, according to RiAA, there is a category of people who treacherously steal money directly from charitable foundations.  These are musical pirates. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      In a recent post on his blog, RiAA states with utmost tragedy that ‚Äúthe album is available for download on all major resources, incl.  torrent trackers: The Pirate Bay, Torrentz, etc.  This fact emphasizes how terrible p2p piracy is. ‚Äù <br><br>  RiAA‚Äôs position is simple: pirates <b>deliberately steal money from poor Haitians</b> .  But is it? <br><br>  In response to this statement, <a href="http://www.musically.com/cgi-bin/content.cgi%3Fpage%3Dindex">Music Ally</a> (a company specializing in research in the music business) compared the downloads of this release with other well-known singles, and it turned out that ‚ÄúWe Are The World‚Äù downloads are much less.  But it doesn‚Äôt even matter, the question is, how many of those who downloaded would actually buy a charity CD if it were not available for download in bittorrent?  And who knows, maybe they have already donated money in a more adequate way (read, directly)? <br><br>  Another research group, <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/">Techdirt</a> , recalled that sites like <a href="http://www.torrentz.com/">Torrentz</a> do not even store .torrent files, but are just a search engine, in this respect they are no different from, for example, Google, through which you can also find links to torrent files . <br><br>  But the most important thing, why the RIAA blog post seems extremely hypocritical is that charity releases like "We Are The World" bring a huge amount of money to the music and related industries.  Why not consider this as robbing the affected Haitians? <br><br>  Columbia Records received a lot of money for the release of the first ‚ÄúWe Are The World‚Äù, so far, the ‚Äúcopyright holders‚Äù receive a small denyuzhku from this release.  I must also say that some of the songs in the charity collection (for example, ‚ÄúDo They Know It's Christmas?‚Äù) Were generally released on dozens of different compilations, about which neither RiAA nor the Red Cross have ever heard in their lives. <br><br>  It is not yet known how long the income from the single will actually go to the fund to help Haiti.  For example, iTunes after several months of sales of a single, get it at full disposal (and accordingly, receive 100% of the income from it). <br><br>  So, RiAA again made an absolutely ridiculous attempt to denigrate the already black name of pirates, using, as always, absolutely ridiculous and illogical arguments, and again the negative reaction to this statement turned out to be much stronger than a positive one. <br>  So, when will we see the beginning of the end of the RIAA? <br><br>  via TorrentFreak </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/86733/">https://habr.com/ru/post/86733/</a></p>
