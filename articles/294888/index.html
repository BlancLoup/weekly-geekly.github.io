For this purpose, ordinary business centers are assigned the status of a technopark.  Who benefits?  What should be the "right" technopark?  Does the number of technology parks affect the investment attractiveness of the Russian economy? <br><br>  <a href="http://motek.ru/">Motek-C</a> , a company specializing in industrial refrigeration equipment, bought an abandoned industrial area in the north-east of Moscow 15 years ago and built the Otradny business center there. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  ‚ÄúFor our company, the creation of a technopark is a spontaneous story.  We focused on our needs, but it turned out that such a symbiosis of services: a warehouse, service and good engineering solutions are needed not only for us, ‚Äùsays the head of Motek-C, Alexander Rubin.  Later "Motek-C" together with the company <a href="http://www.ltcompany.com/">"Light Technologies"</a> began to build a new line of technopark.

      ‚ÄúFor the best IT companies, we need offices that exceed <a href="http://grand-mo.ru/klass_office">class A</a> standards.  Specialists of such structures are worth their weight in gold, and they work practically around the clock - we need beautiful rooms, high-quality ventilation, sports halls, showers, rooms and babysitters for children, ‚Äùexplains Rubin. <br><br>  Over ten years, 1.3 billion rubles have been invested in the creation of a business center.  In June of this year, ‚ÄúOtradny‚Äù received the status of a technopark.  Resident companies received benefits on renting and paying income tax (13.5%).  In the next ten years, the Moscow authorities will invest in the project 370 million rubles in the form of tax incentives. <br><br>  In addition to Otradny, several private business centers received similar status this summer: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DpEz-ZiGbL1I">Photonics</a> on Schelkovskoye Highway, <a href="http://dnpp.mos.ru/directions-of-activity-/investment-climate/general-information/technopark-temp.php">Temp</a> radio factory in the Southern District and <a href="http://www.arendator.ru/objects/10133-tehnopark_elma/">Elma</a> in Zelenograd, and in the territory of New Moscow - <a href="http://technospark.ru/">Tehnospark</a> in Troitsk.  Together with <a href="http://technopark.sk.ru/">Skolkovo</a> and Moscow (the territory of the Moskvich plant), there are now 17 technology parks in the capital.  Technoparks need at least five dozen to become a truly innovative capital, city officials believe. <br><br>  ‚ÄúNo one had absolutely no understanding of what a technopark is, why it is needed and what place it occupies in the commercialization system - no one answered such questions at the state level,‚Äù recalls Andrey Shpilenko, director of the Association of Clusters and Technoparks. <br><br>  By world standards, a technopark is a developed and heterogeneous infrastructure, thanks to which a science-intensive start-up company can get all the necessary services and facilities for starting a business, including tax breaks, professional expertise and so on.  As a rule, business incubators, collective use centers, and laboratories operate at such sites. <br><br>  Russian ‚Äúorganizations that call themselves technoparks,‚Äù as Andrei Shpilenko emphasizes, only in 10% of cases ‚Äúprovide all necessary services: business acceleration, mentoring support, raising money,‚Äù and only 5% provide the necessary infrastructure to their tenants.  According to the association, out of 178 of our technoparks, only six ( <a href="http://tpark.ict.nsc.ru/">Novosibirsk</a> , <a href="http://www.technopark-mordovia.ru/">Mordovia</a> , <a href="http://itechnopark.ru/">Sarov</a> , <a href="http://www.tp86.ru/">Technopark of high technologies</a> in Ugra, <a href="http://itpark-kazan.ru/">IT park</a> in Tatarstan and <a href="http://www.z-valley.com/">Zhiguli Valley</a> in Samara) fully fulfill their direct function and Were able to pass the appropriate accreditation.  The remaining organizations believe that the technopark is just a development project, within which modern office buildings for IT companies are being built. <br><br>  According to the Association of Clusters and Technoparks, there is not a single ‚Äúright‚Äù Technopark in Moscow.  Is that "Skolkovo", but he lives by his own rules (prescribed in the Law on the innovation center "Skolkovo").  ‚ÄúOtradnoe‚Äù is a quite successful private project, but you cannot call it a technopark: it is not designed for the innovative development of small enterprises and works only with large corporations, providing them with all the necessary infrastructure, Kommersant <a href="http://kommersant.ru/doc/2805703">reports</a> , citing the Money magazine. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAlthough GOSTs for technoparks were adopted this summer, but with a strong desire, the title can be assigned even to a public house - there is not a single law in the law prohibiting it,‚Äù admits Andrei Shpilenko.  Meanwhile, according to the association, since 2006, about 60 billion rubles of state funds have already been spent on the creation of technoparks.  The creation of a technology park in Kazan from the federal and regional budget took 2.9 billion rubles.  According to the Association of Clusters and Technoparks, the construction of a technopark of approximately the same amount should cost.  Kazan IT-park is one of the few technoparks that have passed accreditation.  Moreover, the project really became successful and in five years it became self-sufficient. <br><br>  Moscow authorities give the status of technoparks including private successful projects.  But in order to reach the stated figure of ‚Äú50‚Äù, the remaining private projects will not be enough, and the construction of new technology parks takes a lot of time. <br><br>  ‚ÄúOur economy is lame because there are a huge gap between its three very important components - school, science and industry - there is no conducting infrastructure.  Technoparks should become such an infrastructure.  But this does not mean that in order to increase investment attractiveness, we must invest exclusively in their construction.  There are many other unsolved problems that delay our innovative development, ‚Äùnotes Andrei Shpilenko. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294888/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294888/</a></p>
