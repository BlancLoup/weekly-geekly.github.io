I want to consider only the creation of promotional sites, that is, sites for promoting products or services.  The main problems of study are the issues of client and project management, issues of management of creative teams and processes.  As a result, I would like to develop in communication with the audience a common conceptual apparatus for working with similar projects in Russia.  Since the topic is complex and depends on many factors, I do not pretend to the exclusiveness of thoughts and ideas. <br><br><br><br><h1>  Request </h1><br><h3>  The first acquaintance and exchange of contact information </h3><br>  At the first stage, a simple phone call can be a first acquaintance.  The person receiving the call must obtain from the client information about the company, contact details and information about the issue of interest.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  Preliminary estimate of the minimum cost </h3><br>  This is an important point.  If a client is interested in value, then it is necessary to understand (at least try to add an idea from a telephone conversation) with whom you are communicating and decide for yourself with strategies and pricing policies. <br><br>  Options for discussion may be as follows: <br><ul><li>  in any case it is worth asking about the estimated budget </li><li>  You can call the minimum cost of the site (but remember, customers often perceive the minimum cost as final at the stage of talking on the phone) </li><li>  you can answer that you cannot calculate the cost of the site now (it‚Äôs necessary to explain why, because most companies will answer this question clearly to the client and incorrectly show their obstinacy without explaining the reasons, although of course this is a personal matter of everyone) </li><li>  if the task is not clearly clear, and there is interest in the project, then it is better to ask a number of additional questions (timelines, similar projects) and give an answer on the cost depending on them.  And maybe offer to answer additional questions in the mail and then generate the cost. </li></ul><br>  We are considering an option when the company understands what can make any project budget profitable for itself.  But at the same time he knows his minimum threshold of cost and labor. <br><br>  For example, we are approached by a client who needs a promotional site for the Kuzka Hills cottage community.  This is an understandable and analyzable project, because  There are already a <a href="http://yandex.ru/yandsearch%3Ftext%3D%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B6%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9%2B%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA">lot of</a> similar sites on the Internet. <br><br>  We understand that we can make a one-page promotional website and it will be conditionally worth two.  And we can make a promotional website with more complex navigation, using 3d and video, and in this case the product will cost the client a conditional ‚Äúone hundred and two‚Äù.  If we have such an idea during the conversation, then we need to either discuss it with the client (who may already have a vision of what project he needs by difficulty), or suggest evaluating the site after receiving the brief or additional information. <br><br>  In any case, they appealed to you with a clear task or not at all, try to be honest and open in communication.  The continuation of communication will depend on your interest and desire to help the client.  If you do not know the cost of the project or you do not have experience in similar work, then tell about it directly and suggest options for how you can help. <br><br>  As I continue to describe the scheme and correct it, I will have to lay out the material here as it is being compiled.  Interestingly, of course, would it be necessary for someone to know what I‚Äôm writing at all? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/45892/">https://habr.com/ru/post/45892/</a></p>
