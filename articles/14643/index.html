  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Operators dispose of "one" in direct numbers.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <strong>Russian operators intend to fulfill the requirements of the order of the Ministry of Information Technologies “On approval and introduction of the Russian system and new numbering” in time, according to which all direct telephone numbers beginning with “1” are removed from use from January 1, 2008. According to analysts, In this connection, it is not worthwhile to wait for migration of subscribers, but cellular companies will have to carry out serious explanatory work in order to retain maximum of such users.</strong> <br><br>  By January 1, 2008, Russian operators will have to release all telephone numbers beginning with “1”.  By this, they are bound by Order No. 142 of the Ministry of Information Technology and Communications of the Russian Federation No. 142 of “On Approval and Implementation of the Russian System and Numbering Plan”, signed by Leonid Reiman on November 17, 2006. From next year, access to emergency services will be carried out under a single number 112, therefore, in order to avoid erroneous routing, the regulator requires the release of all the corresponding numbering capacity. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  MGTS has long been transferring its subscribers from the first millionth capacity in the code "495".  Our interlocutor in the company said that the replacement scheme may involve the transfer of the subscriber to the code "499" or the replacement of the first digit.  In some cases, two or more digits are replaced.

      As Comstar reported, today they have about 90 thousand "direct" numbers, starting with "1".  Most of them are leased to mobile operators - MTS and Sky Link. <br><br>  The company "VimpelCom" in the Moscow region currently has about 19 thousand subscribers using additional (in the "495" code) telephone numbers in this capacity.  “We appreciate our regular customers, value their loyal attitude and understand that these changes may cause them inconvenience,” said Vladimir Ryabokon, vice president and regional director of the Moscow region of VimpelCom.  “In order to make the transition to new numbers as comfortable as possible, VimpelCom offers its subscribers a wide range of solutions to this issue.” <br><br>  The company offers a choice of three options to all subscribers of “direct” numbers, starting with “1”.  The first option ensures the preservation of the seven-digit number, but in the code "499" instead of "495".  Also, the subscriber remains his former federal number in the code "903".  The second option is a new number in the code "495", and the corresponding new federal number in the code "903".  When choosing one of these options, the subscriber needs to renew the contract with VimpelCom OJSC and the local telephone network operator providing the new additional phone number in any of the Beeline sales and service offices in the Moscow region.  As a third option, the subscriber is asked to choose from the federal number capacity number with a “beautiful” combination of numbers that do not match with its current number in the “903” code. <br><br>  The replacement of numbers in MTS will take place from October 12 to October 30, 2007. The number of subscribers with “direct” numbers to “1” is not reported.  The company will warn about changing the number of SMS-notifications.  In addition, the MTS contact center specialists will contact each of the subscribers who are affected by this issue, explain the essence of the changes and help you choose the best option.  "MTS subscribers will be able to continue to use the usual number, starting with" 1 "in the code" 985 "," explained the press service of the company.  - Previously, when calling a “direct” number, the subscriber number was always identified with the given code.  For those who wish to continue to use the direct seven-digit city number, the first two digits “10” will change to “22” or “92”.  Replacement of numbers will occur automatically, the subscriber will not need to come to the MTS office to renew the contract. ” <br><br>  If it is important for the subscriber to keep a “beautiful” number with repeated numbers, then MTS promises to pick up a similar “beautiful” number for it.  In addition, the operator will provide subscribers with the opportunity to send SMS for free within three months in order to inform relatives and friends about the number change. <br><br>  For MegaFon, the problem of replacing direct numbers starting with “1” does not exist, since it simply does not have such numbers.  But the representative of the operator assured of the readiness to accept users from competitors: MegaFon offers them to keep the same number for free, but with the new code “925”. <br><br>  The press service of Sky Link told CNews that in the Moscow region the company currently has about 13 thousand active subscribers with direct numbers starting with “107” and “109”.  “At first we were going to start replacing these numbers in October, but the beginning of the process is delayed, since so far Comstar, to which they belong, has not received number replacement capacity from the regulator,” said our interlocutor at Sky Link. <br><br>  Analysts believe that the mass outcome of cellular subscribers, which affects the process of changing numbers, should not be expected.  “But for a number of users, changing the number will certainly be the decisive reason for changing the operator,” said Maxim Savvatin, a senior analyst at iKS-Consulting.  “The aggressive policy of poaching subscribers, for example, from MegaFon, can also play a significant role here.” <br><br>  “Naturally, subscribers are unhappy with this process,” said Irina Astafyeva, a senior analyst at J'son &amp; Partners.  - The vast majority of them belong to the high-yield segment and use the services of one operator for quite a long period of time.  One of the reasons why these subscribers did not change the operator is the need to change the number.  If you need to change the number, a number of such subscribers may well change the operator - first of all, those users who have complaints about the quality of the services provided. ” <br><br>  According to experts, operators can only level out the consequences of the process of withdrawing direct numbers starting with a “unit” among those subscribers who carry out active loyalty programs.  “It is necessary not only to put the subscriber before the fact by SMS, but to convey to him correctly all the information, to show that the operator takes care of him and such changes are a forced measure on the part of the operator,” Ms. Astafyeva notes. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.cnews.ru/">CNews.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/14643/">https://habr.com/ru/post/14643/</a></p>
