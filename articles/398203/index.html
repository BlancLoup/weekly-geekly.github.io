And where is Kingston?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>Hi, Giktayms!</b>  As habrazhiteli already know, Kingston memory cards easily transfer <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/kingston_technology/blog/276076/">both heat and cold</a> , and can also solve the most incredible and complex tasks.  What is the most valuable thing about video production?  Reliability!  Not a frame by.  Under the cut a story about unusual people, whose work was seen by many of the readers of our blog.  So, <a href="http://www.cgfww.com/">CGF Visual Effects Studio</a> , and yes, they use Kingston memory cards! <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/kingston_technology/blog/281248/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dff/d1a/dd7/dffd1add7a694b628dd4586b5d8e4699.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Do you know how to make a movie?  Just running people with a camera for people in suits?  Of course not!  There is a huge army of directors, screenwriters, make-up artists, costume designers, but they were all good and relevant years ago.  Now not less, and often a big role, specialists in post processing play.  Tell me, is it funny that the real dragon appeared in The Hobbit?  No, he was drawn by great masters of computer graphics, but frankly, none of the living have seen the dragon, so we have to be content with the fantasies of the animator. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d4a/4c9/365/d4a4c93651b746b6b2e3d610754ea12c.jpg">

Will they not actually cast the actors off the plane or throw them under the train?  Need to beautifully draw special effects. <br><br>  Fans of computer games know that the realism of human faces in computer graphics has advanced far enough since the time of the first DOOM√°, but still, even Geralt from Rivia does not look very real.  In the movie so it is impossible, everything should be believable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d21/232/c2d/d21232c2d98b4901859a1ff9a6cff2af.jpg"><br><br>  For this purpose, three-dimensional models of actors are created, which are later controlled by editing specialists.  And who creates these models?  Gesture recognition systems, like Kinect, have been working successfully for a long time, but something more is needed.  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A4%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">Photogrammetry</a> comes to the rescue. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e0d/d32/edc/e0dd32edced446c4b026f9837f7ad6ad.jpg"><br><br>  I will work as a captain of Evidence and I will say that we need a completely cosmic detailing and just a couple of three webcams, of course, will not be enough.  Comes to the aid of a large number of cameras located around the object.  Pictures from a large number of angles can be combined and transferred to software and then stitched into a single image. <br><br>  For scanning a person using photogrammetry, the most important parameters are the overlap and offset between the pictures taken.  The optimal overlap of adjacent images is 40-50% in increments of 10-15 ¬∞.  Ideally, use full-size cameras, for example, Canon 5D Mark3, and 50mm mid-focal lenses.  The quality of the three-dimensional model made by such a technique will be very high, but at the same time the cost of the whole system will become transcendental. <br><br>  CGF uses Canon 1100D cameras with Canon 40mm lenses in an amount of 80 pieces.  When this is achieved 30-35% overlap in increments of 15 ¬∞.  This is not enough for obtaining human scans, which are necessary for further photorealistic quality, since blind zones are formed, small details are missing and there is a generally small geometric noise. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/26kZU-XCLlI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Now the company's specialists are working on a new system, already in 120 full-frame cameras, which will allow to make even more detailed models and textures. <br><br>  The graphics core is most actively involved in image processing, so in addition to the Intel Core i7 and 32/64 gigabytes of RAM, the NVIDIA Quadro M5000 and NVIDIA GTX TITAN are always used.  Data storage requires several terabytes of disk space, but for operational work with scans, of course, you need SSD drives. <br><br>  In photogrammetry, the synchronism of all cameras and the shared access to the controlling computer are important, and for this purpose a complex scheme has been created: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ The computer has 4 boards with USB controllers. <br>  ‚Ä¢ 3 USB hubs are connected to each controller. <br>  ‚Ä¢ 7 cameras are connected to each hub. <br><br>  The connection scheme is reliable enough, but it suffers from the speed of transferring photos to a computer.  It takes about 1.5 minutes to transfer one scan from 80 photos in RAW before you can start doing the next one.  This problem can be solved by distributing camera connections among several computers.  Thus, the transfer will be carried out in parallel, but still it will not be fast (30 seconds per scan), there are also problems with the synchronization of the material and the use of additional equipment. <br><br>  The solution is to install flash cards in each camera.  Time reduced to 3 seconds!  It is needed only for reloading flash.  In parallel, the material is transmitted and the end of the session is on the main computer. <br><br>  To control such a number of cameras and to obtain material from them, studio specialists developed their own software.  Typically, the processing of images and the construction of a three-dimensional model occurs in the programs Agisoft PhotoScan and RealityCapture. <br><br>  The scanning process itself takes about 1/100 of a second.  This is the time required for synchronous photographing of a person from different angles.  After that, you need an interval of three seconds to recharge the flashes and you can scan the next object or person.  But after that, the titanic work of the computer begins - even the rough processing of a three-dimensional model of a person takes from one to three hours.  In this case, the processing time traditionally depends on the configuration of the workstation, the detail settings, and the software used. <br><br>  Oh yeah, I mentioned that the work of the studio is known to almost everyone.  Among their works of this year are the hits ‚ÄúCrew‚Äù, ‚ÄúHardcore‚Äù and ‚ÄúBen-Hur‚Äù.  And the freshest work - the clip of the American singer The Weeknd <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CW5oGRx9CLM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Nice portfolio!  And ahead of us are waiting for "Viking", "Firs-5", "Major Thunder" and we are very pleased that our memory cards also contributed to these projects.  Who knows what the heights and achievements will come the film industry, but you can always count on years of experience and reliability of Kingston. <br><br>  Thank you for your attention and stay with <b>Kingston</b> on Hiktatimes!
