  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hidden Money in Freelance</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Often beginning freelancers, having executed the project, having successfully received payment <s>and having noted this business</s> , then receive less a lot of money.  Outwardly, they are doing everything right: they continue to actively look at projects, leave applications.  Work with new customers.  Things are going, money is ... but they could be more with less effort. <br><br>  If you do not know about this "hidden" source, then other performers will inevitably bypass you.  And you will wonder how they so often go on vacation, although you work on the same exchange?  (‚ÄúHidden‚Äù in quotes, because in fact everything is simple, and this is one of the pitfalls. People often neglect what lies on the surface and do not use these opportunities, even if they know about them.) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  What is the source? </h4><br>  I'm talking about repeat orders from old customers.  Because to receive an order from a person who has already collaborated with you earlier is much easier than from someone unknown.  Even from the point of view of psychology, if we bought something somewhere, or ordered some services and we liked it, then we are more likely to go to the same place and order there.  Because there we liked it, we know that <i>they will do well there</i> , but we don‚Äôt know about other places.  It may be that in another place is also good, maybe even better, but I do not want to check it, but I want to go and take advantage of a proven and guaranteed option.  Customers are the same people and they have the same psychology. <br><br><h4>  Remind yourself </h4><br>  From time to time remind the customer about yourself.  Remind you that you exist, and ask if they have any orders.  Thereby you will keep this contact up to date.  Do not lose it, but do so that the customer keeps in mind that you are, and if he has some kind of work, so that he immediately turns to you.

      For this you need to maintain a customer base.  All those with whom you somehow worked need to write or in a notebook, or get yourself a table in Google Docs, or in Evernote to get a notebook.  Write down contacts, phone numbers, in short the name and for what reason you have collaborated.  Thus, it will be very easy for you to remind of yourself just by taking the list of contacts, then these people call, write an email. <br><br><h5>  When and how? </h5><br>  You can remind yourself without any reason, you can create a schedule, so that once in 2-3 months this customer base will ring up, update it, and delete idle contacts.  Somewhere a person may say that he is no longer engaged in this (for the first time you can put a mark, for the second time you can exclude it from your database).  Somewhere people will remember about you, and if you call them regularly, they will not forget about you. <br><br>  In addition to the reminders on the schedule, you can still remind yourself on the occasion of the holidays.  For example, to congratulate customers on this or that holiday (Happy New Year, an accounting firm on the Day of the Accountant).  If you know the birthday of your customer, congratulations.  Here you are not selling your services or looking for a job, but simply showing attention to the person. <br><br><h4>  We add bonuses </h4><br>  It makes sense to make some special conditions for repeat orders.  And you report this when you have completed work on this order.  Notify: ‚Äúif you still have any such work, or work from the _____ area (and list the areas in which you specialize), then you personally will have a discount or bonus.‚Äù <br><br>  Think what specials.  conditions you can offer to your customers.  Will it be a discount, or some additional condition that is not difficult for you to do, but it will be pleasant for a person.  For example, a site and contextual advertising.  If you are a context setting specialist and can do a simple advertising campaign in a couple of hours, or you have some automated things (invitation to the VKontakte group, for example), you can provide these services as a bonus to the person who orders from you.  Think about what you can do for your customers and offer them as a bonus if they contact you again. <br><br>  If these tips were helpful to you, then you can find even more in my <a href="http://coding99.ru/tags/temy-zapisey/frilans">blog and book</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/170353/">https://habr.com/ru/post/170353/</a></p>
