  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Free promotion. Basic methods and their performance</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In this article we will look at free promotion methods that have helped us. <br>  The free promotion market is actually not as big as it may seem.  Numerous articles that unleash a resource on the Internet can be quickly, efficiently and for free - a myth.  The concept of ‚Äúfast, high quality and free‚Äù in relation to anything is a myth.  Years earlier, it was possible that there were also resources or methods that allow one to declare oneself for free, but not now.  All resources with open access have acquired anti-spam a long time ago, all the rest have a price tag, and prices, we state with confidence, are not frail.  It was decided to look for free and necessarily working ways to make themselves known. <br><br>  After a certain time, methods that, at least, looked quite viable, were found: <br><br>  - in the blog of a foreign developer, it was told about the site reddit.com, the developer claimed that the site brought him more than 300 in a few days. <br>  - As we have already told, many praised the press release. <br>  - In our opinion, the potential has instagram.

      So, more about each method. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Reddit</b> <br><br>  reddit is a social news site where registered users can post links to any information they like on the Internet.  Like other reddit supports voting system for your favorite posts.  This is what Wikipedia says.  In fact, the next two hours only this time is reference, in Russia this resource is not that not popular, there are suspicions that it is even unknown.  For the entire monitoring period, not a single Russian-speaking application or reference was found.  The results of this resource - the link was not viewed even once, possibly due to the fact that, indeed, the resource is not at all Russian-speaking, despite the fact that the interface has been translated.  Since our application is so far only in the Russian AppStore, it is difficult to talk about the work of this resource in English-speaking countries, but we can say with confidence that Reddit in Russia will most likely not work. <br><br>  <b>Press release</b> <br><br>  The press release is a very interesting thing, but of course the free placement of the wow effect is not available.  In spite of this, the press release was written and posted on resources; on one of them the number of views reached 800, with dignity, but how many of them downloaded the application are impossible to say.  The story of not a large edition, as well as more details about the press release, can be read in our <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/ridewithme/blog/20286/">article on the first marketing activity</a> , so as not to copy-paste, we will not focus on this now. <br><br>  <b>Instagram</b> <br><br>  Everyone knows what instagram is and what it is eaten with, many have raised their online stores and beauty salons there.  The Instagram market is not yet saturated with advertising, by the way, Zuckerberg decided to launch advertising on Instagram just recently.  To create an advertising campaign here you need only a little perseverance.  Hundreds of articles have been written on Instagram promotion, we will not delve into the methods, as we used only three: <br><br>  1) Massfalling - forgive us all. <br>  2) Content that interests the majority and top hashtags. <br>  3) Collaboration with popular user pages. <br><br>  It makes no sense to consider the first two points, we don‚Äôt want to be like hundreds of other sites and articles about promotion on this network, and nobody is interested in it anymore. <br><br>  But the third point is interesting.  Firstly, there are either no articles on how to come to terms with the promoted page / person on Instagram, or everything is written very blurry.  How to do it for free and say no.  So, sharing experience, so to speak. <br><br>  First of all, letters were sent out with offers of cooperation to well-known personalities: tele-stars, stars, stars on ice, stars of stars, other stars and others.  Naturally, 50% simply did not consider it necessary to answer, but oh well, creative people after all.  The other half in response sent only the price tag, we had to explain that we are not an online store, but a social-sports social project, and we have no money.  At this stage, 9 out of 10 were eliminated and the correspondence ended.  One person gave us a discount, and again everything had to be explained in a new way, however, as you already understood, this did not lead to anything. <br>  &lt;philosophically&gt; Well, is it really difficult to find a minute of time to help a young startup, especially since you, a creative person, do not need anything? &lt;/ philosophically&gt; <br>  Many will ask: ‚ÄúWhat were you waiting for, naive?‚Äù We were waiting for this, unfortunately, but hope dies last, isn‚Äôt it? <br><br>  Parable about three girls-athletes who helped us. <br>  We did not despair, and continued to send suggestions.  And with a periodicity of a couple of days, we were answered by three wonderful kind girls with a large number of subscribers (yes, it still happens).  Everyone agreed to work with us, we developed a special promotional post for them and the text to it.  The girls did not ask for any money, or shoes, or boots, or fur coats: nothing!  Moreover, they liked our idea.  Indeed, who else but they will know about situations where there is no one with whom to go to the gym. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Promo post</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fa6/d8a/15b/fa6d8a15b1a942ca9d80d9ab1f00eea8.jpg"><br></div></div><br>  The article came to an end.  To summarize, we want to appeal to the entire community of mega-brain.  We are a very young startup, you can help us if you download the application, and we will be very grateful for your help and support. <br>  <a href="">Link to the application.</a> <br>  If you have noticed a bug, crash, or you have an idea how to improve our product - write us at support@ridewithme.ru or in the comments here.  We try to answer everyone.  We value you and your opinion, because we make an application for people. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295452/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295452/</a></p>
