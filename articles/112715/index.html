But even changing Nokia to another device is a huge hemorrhoids.  Half a day already trying to pull my contacts from the phone, Ovi Suite address book and Ovi Contacts service.  So far, all I've managed is to get a folder with 200+ vcf cards. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  I did not think he wondered ... </h4><br>  And it‚Äôs true, well, I didn‚Äôt think that any company would allow itself to forbid me to do what I want with my contacts.  Yes, formally this is not a ban, they simply ‚Äúdo not provide such functionality,‚Äù but in fact it is akin to a ban.  Here they are, contact, on the screen.  If you want to - sit back and handle copy-paste, and if you want to - take a pen and copy it neatly from the screen to moleskine ... <br><br>  Nevertheless, <b>Ovi Suite does not allow you to export contacts</b> .  Usually we climb on the forums.  We are no longer surprised - the forums are full of groans, no one helps people, people are forced to help each other.  That's what I understand - working with the community!  Rows of homegrown experts are full. <br><br><h4>  He did not expect ... </h4><br>  In general, the most common advice is to make a backup of contacts in * .nbu, and then use third-party software, which will gut the backup and pull information from it, for example, this free solution: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/nbuexplorer/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/ nbuexplorer /</a> .

      So I got at my disposal a folder full of * .vcfs.  Thank you, at least something. <br><br>  Okay, dig further.  It seems that MS Outlook is able to export contacts, and it is getting better with each new version.  We go to Ovi Suite, enable synchronization with Outlook in the settings, click Sync contacts ... And we get a bummer, and one more, and again, and again.  And all times with a different not speaking nothing the error code.  Either Ovi Suite does not know how to work with Outlook 2010, or something else, but the point is that this way to the stars was blocked by impassable thorns. <br><br>  But the main thing in this is different - it is still good. I have the phone itself - I can at least make a backup and dump the cards into the folder.  And if there is no tube?  <b>If you have lost / drowned your Nokia, then there can be no question of any backups, nor of any synchronization.</b>  Actually, you have two paths - either go to the store for a new Nokia (and still pray that contacts will be pulled up there, because I‚Äôm never sure if this will happen), or collect new contacts, forever saying goodbye to those with whom there is no connection in any Facebook (yes, and with his grandmother from Orel, too). <br><br><h4>  This is the end ... </h4><br>  Should I write that my davyebanulistamchtoli account (oh, this one! I‚Äôll remember the history of its establishment, I‚Äôm starting to shake it) on ovi.com was also completely useless - I couldn‚Äôt pull out my contacts using my own means or Google Mail.  I think that the only remaining option is to import the pulled out * vcf-ki into Google one by one (halloween, google, make a batch import !!!!). <br><br>  In general, I don‚Äôt understand such an attitude to people from Nokia - if you couldn‚Äôt keep the user with the quality of the devices and services, inserting sticks into the wheels of the outgoing user is just meanness.  Goodbye Finnish guys, I <u>‚Äôm sure</u> that you and I will never cross again. <br><br>  PS In order to turn on the Silent mode (so that the phone does not squeak while I put Google on it), he asks me to insert a SIM card.  Well, of course, that ... <br><br>  PPS They threw the idea, almost ingenious in its simplicity, to copy contacts to SIM.  However, Nokia copies both the name and the Surname in the "Surname" field, which has a limit on the number of characters.  As a result, "Alexander Nikolina" turns into a man without a name with the name "Alexander N". <br><br>  PPPS Look at the number of comments and proposed solutions.  No proposed solution works if the phone is lost.  With my phone model (Nokia N86 8MP), no solution works either.  And they say to me in comments that "this is not meanness."  And what is this? <br><br>  PPPS Solution from <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/shadowalone/" class="user_link">shadowalone</a> : Batch vcf import to google: <br>  Just checked, everything is simple. <br>  Go to the contacts, select all (Mark all) <br>  Next, Create Backup -&gt; Phone to memory card <br>  Other / Contacts folder appears on the memory card <br>  Where there is a bunch of vcf files.  Merge these on the computer. <br>  Next, we merge all these files into one <br>  cd / dir_of_contacts / <br>  cat * .vcf&gt; ../ ALL.vcf <br>  And import the file into a google account <br>  for Windows <br>  cd / dir_of_contacts / <br>  copy * .vcf&gt; ../ ALL.vcf </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/112715/">https://habr.com/ru/post/112715/</a></p>
