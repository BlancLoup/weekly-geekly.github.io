Website indeed.com provides a very convenient tool for viewing various trends, in this case we asked him for the dynamics of demand for the most popular languages ‚Äã‚Äãfor the Web: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/430/fbb/4c2/430fbb4c288b37ee011c342ba5ab9de6.png" width="450" height="250" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      In general, the most popular American site for finding jobs in IT is Dice.com, but alas, it does not currently have similar functionality.  However, the current results on Dice are not far from these graphs, so the result can be considered relatively true.  What conclusions can be made? <br><br>  <strong>1. Java &amp; C # are the most popular languages ‚Äã‚Äãand share the main market share.</strong>  Their positions are very strong: <br><br>  .NET has good support from MS and is actively developing, delighting developers with successes in bleeding-edge areas (Silverlight) and a high-quality single set of development tools from the manufacturer (from the operating system to the database, the development environment, ria, etc.). <br><br>  Java, in turn, has support for a number of vendors (Sun, Oracle, IBM, SAP, Red Hat), large companies (Intel, Google, HP) and communities (Apache, Eclipse). <br><br>  <strong>2. JavaScript is actively growing and without a doubt it can be called the ‚Äúscripting language of the Internet‚Äù</strong> .  JS growth will continue further for the following reasons: <br><br>  JavaScript is a standard recognized by developers of all browsers.  As long as we live in the world of Web - JS will be successful.  It is also used in the Adobe Flex RIA development tool. <br><br>  In 2008, ECMAScript version 4 is coming out.  Besides the fact that JS will acquire the familiar class-based OO-model, it will become the only dynamic language with optional support for static types, which will actively increase its popularity on the server side. <br><br>  <strong>3. Dynamic languages ‚Äã‚Äãgrow about the same, but still slowly.</strong> <br><br>  The first version of Ruby on Rails came out 4 years ago, but in spite of the huge boom in the Ruby blogosphere, it never became much in demand in the market, although Python is quietly catching up with job openings.  PHP is the most popular language of this triple.  In general, as we see, the number of blog posts and the list of technologies on which the 20 most popular Web 2.0 sites are built have little to do with the real labor market in which the world lives. <br><br>  In version 6 of the JDK, developers could use javax.script ‚Äî the JavaScript implementation for JVM built into the SDK called Mozilla Rhino.  It has already found its use on Google‚Äôs servers.  Sun also actively sponsors the developers of JRuby &amp; Jython - it is quite possible that in OpenJDK 7, in addition to the promised improved support for dynamic languages, we will see javax.ruby &amp; javax.python.  Microsoft is also actively developing its own Iron technologies, so one of the options for the future is development in different languages ‚Äã‚Äãfor two main platforms: Java &amp; .NET. <br><br>  <strong>UPDATE.</strong>  <strong>Just a couple of words.</strong> <br><br>  As many have rightly noted, almost all languages ‚Äã‚Äãfrom the list are general-purpose languages ‚Äã‚Äãand it is difficult to select ‚ÄúWeb-only‚Äù vacancies.  For example, on Dice, the query ‚Äújava AND (web OR j2ee OR jsp OR struts)‚Äù gives 10 thousand out of 15 according to ‚Äújava‚Äù, but even here the presence of one of these words is not at all the guarantor of what the Web developer is looking for.  Many Web applications in our realities consist of completely different front-and-back-end, and the developer often does not even call the developer a web-developer. <br><br>  C ++ &amp; Perl was also not mentioned for quite clear reasons: the former is less commonly used on the Web, the latter has already been counted among the dying, although there are as many COBOL vacancies as Ruby / Python.  Technology is dying slowly, especially corporate applications. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/28971/">https://habr.com/ru/post/28971/</a></p>
