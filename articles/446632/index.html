    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ob/a0/tb/oba0tbvbmhnp8w7cgipehbvxox4.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Own business and specialty work </h3><br>  I studied in law school and in parallel - in the third year - in business school.  There was a lot of theory and practice in the creation and development of business.  At that time, I was also interested in the literature on personal effectiveness and psychology - books by Stephen Covey, Eric Bern, and read stories of famous billionaires: Richard Branson, Warren Buffett, Bill Gates.  Inspired by the books and what was told in the courses, I thought that I could take any task. <br><br>  I got excited about the idea to start my own business, I took academic leave at the university and opened a travel agency.  I was a director, but - since the company was very small, from one to three employees at different times - I was engaged in everything.  He sold tours himself, taught his subordinates to this, thought through marketing policy, prepared tax reports, resolved legal issues. <br><br>  At some point, I began to feel disappointed.  At the very beginning I thought that I would quickly fix the processes and would only come for the money.  It turned out that it does not work that way: it is often necessary to devote evenings and even weekends to your business.  The financial results were not as impressive as I had hoped.  The agency consistently made a profit, but I never knew what would happen in a month - what kind of disasters would happen in which country - and how successful the sales would be.  As a result, having received a good experience, having formed a client base, having grown several employees, I sold the agency and returned to the university. <br><br>  Jurisprudence is not very fascinating to me.  I performed the tasks successfully, but this did not ‚Äúlight up‚Äù me.  In addition, seeing on the websites with the salaries of lawyers, I thought that the prospects were not very good.  Therefore, I did not want to work in my specialty and after defending my diploma I began to look for a job that would suit me. <br><br>  I was immediately offered to become a specialist in the sale of credit products in a large bank, and they promised a good salary.  I knew that I love to talk, and if I really like something, I can talk about it with pleasure.  Therefore, I agreed.  Loans there were very profitable for customers, and I successfully sold them.  I liked this job.  Once I even took the third place in terms of sales among all employees of the Russian branches of the bank. <br><br>  After some time, the conditions changed, the loans went up, and I needed not just to present the product, but to manipulate people in order to buy it.  And I do not like it.  So I realized that this work is also not for me. <br><br>  I did not know what to do next, the state was depressed.  And suddenly a classmate, with whom we studied at the law school, offered to work in the specialty.  I had no idea where to go, and I decided to try it - suddenly I would like it.  For four years I was a lawyer.  During this time, he worked in different areas - in the management company, in advertising, real estate rental, construction. <br><br>  I may have come across unsuccessful companies, or maybe it‚Äôs my perception, but I realized that this work doesn‚Äôt work for me either.  Mostly we had to do contract work, almost always in a short time, and interesting court cases were rarely encountered.  Considering that the lawyers market is oversaturated and the salaries are small, I thought it was time to change the scope of activities. <br><br><h3>  As I turned to IT </h3><br>  Perhaps I would have become a programmer much earlier.  In the eighth grade, I chose a technical profile and went to a math class: I thought I was addicted to this.  I studied well, but the load was great and I was very tired.  Once we discussed this with our parents and came to the conclusion that engineers are not as popular as lawyers and economists.  So I moved to the humanitarian class, and then I entered the law school budget.  But I always liked mathematics and computer science. <br><br>  I have some programming friends.  One of my friends, without having a specialized education, learned how to program and became a successful developer - he creates complex distributed systems.  I was very inspired by his story.  I understood that this is real, and not in transcendental terms.  When I worked as a lawyer, my colleagues said that I am good at creating systems (for example, for the distribution of work among employees).  I thought it was not so far from development, and such work was given to me easily.  I had a thought: ‚ÄúWhy not learn to program too?‚Äù Then I was still working as a lawyer, but I felt it was time to change something. <br><br>  Work in IT seemed to me more comfortable.  Flexible schedule, no dress code - everyone walks in jeans and T-shirts, a lot of buns - in the literal and figurative sense, attractive salaries, and the demand for specialists is growing all the time. <br><br>  I began to dig, what kind of development is closer to me - backend or frontend.  At the friendly gatherings there was a lot of talk about programming, and I already understood a bit what was happening.  I understand that I want to write a backend.  I read which languages ‚Äã‚Äãare popular and decided to learn Java. <br><br><h3>  Programming from scratch </h3><br>  I began to look for courses on the Internet and came across JavaRush - there they are learning how to develop from scratch.  He began to take this course and worked in parallel. <br><br>  At the very beginning of the way it was difficult for me to think abstractions, to create a new logic.  It took a lot of time.  Sometimes I thought about the tasks that I had on the courses for several days. <br><br>  I started with elementary programs - one of the first that I wrote, I could communicate with the user.  She displayed the text, I chose what to answer, and the program built its work depending on my answer. <br><br>  I remember how I created the first multi-threaded application.  It was cool to understand that one logic is implemented in one thread, another - in another, they interact, and everything works. <br><br>  Half a year after the start of the courses, I realized that I wanted to work on the development purposefully, and quit my job.  I was worried: I was 28 years old, I gave up my career as a lawyer and did not know what was to come.  I wanted to quickly learn Java.  But when there is this internal pressure - you need to hurry, time is running out, - it becomes more difficult to learn, because stress takes a lot of energy. <br><br>  A programmer friend suggested reading the book ‚ÄúJava: The Complete Reference‚Äù.  It is written in accessible language and gives a good base.  I studied it too. <br><br>  Several of my development friends worked at EPAM, and from them I learned that the company was conducting training courses in programming.  There were good reviews about the company and the courses, and I wanted to get into them.  While I was waiting for a new set, I decided to take courses in Oracle and Java at Sbertech.  It was necessary to pass a decent selection: out of 130 people who wanted to take the course took 30 people.  My basic knowledge and little experience turned out to be enough to get into their number. <br><br>  Some time later, a recruitment course for Java development began at the EPAM training center.  I decided to go for it.  There, the dropout was also great, you had to pass two interviews - by phone and full-time.  The interviews assessed basic knowledge of Java, the ability to create simple logic on the go and checked the level of English.  As a result, they took me to the training center. <br><br>  I began to simultaneously take two courses - at Sbertech and at EPAM.  Together with me, mostly people with technical education studied.  There were those who have already worked in testing or development.  I was not sure of myself: not only did I come from a completely different area - I was older than most of the guys.  But I really wanted to finish the courses and get a job.  Therefore, all my time was spent on lectures and homework.  During the courses, we studied the basics of object-oriented programming, classes and methods in Java, familiarized ourselves with libraries and frameworks, and at the end created a client-server application on Spring and AngularJS. <br><br><h3>  Forward to the new </h3><br>  In the summer of 2016 - six months after the start of courses - I was offered a job in both IT companies.  I chose EPAM: I wanted to go there from the very beginning, my friends worked there, and they liked it. <br><br>  There was an interesting moment: when the courses at EPAM came to an end, our group was asked who wanted to work with Big Data.  They raised their hands all but me.  I knew little about this direction, I heard that working with big data is not easy.  Plus, I almost had no development experience.  I just wanted to program in Java, there was no big ambition. <br><br>  But after the interview at the end of the course I was called exactly on the Big Data direction.  I thought for a long time, weighed the pros and cons.  I thought so: on the one hand, when you are called to the company of your dream without work experience, it is unreasonable to refuse or present your demands.  On the other hand, I was frightened by the complexity of this trend.  But I knew that this area was promising.  In addition, before starting work on the Big Data-project, it was necessary to take another internal course at EPAM, which gave a sense of security.  And I decided. <br><br>  The two-month course turned out to be intense: we got acquainted with different technologies - Hadoop, Spark, Kafka, HBase, Elasticsearch, Ignite, Cassandra, Flink.  We learned to write data processing programs, learned about virtual machines, Docker containers and other things that Big Data developers need. <br><br>  Then for three months we participated in Flour data streaming-project, Flink - created a new functionality or corrected errors.  It was an interesting experience: you interact with people from other parts of the world and participate in the development of such a complex system. <br><br>  At the beginning of my work I had an impostor syndrome.  From school I used to be the best: I studied perfectly well, I was a headman at the university.  And here I felt worse, because there was little I could do.  But I always take the pressure - just come and do it, day after day.  At first I recorded conversations with colleagues when we communicated via Skype, so as not to ask again.  Over time, the need for records disappeared.  I began to quickly grasp, better cope with the tasks. <br><br>  Understand something new had to constantly.  Here I was helped by Google or the advice of colleagues.  Sometimes you had to read the documentation - good, you can easily find it.  Some things learned from the video. <br><br>  Depending on the project, Big Data-developer can write in Java, Python, Scala and a number of other languages.  It so happened that on my projects I mastered Scala and now I program mainly in this language. <br><br>  When I came to IT, I lacked communication.  In the gymnasium, at the law school, in previous works it was very much.  Here people are silent for a long time, more immersed in themselves.  But if you ask for help, they will help you. <br><br>  Now I‚Äôm a middle-level developer, and in my plans to grow to a project manager.  I think it will be close to me.  I was already engaged in some managerial tasks on projects, and it worked out pretty well. <br><br><h3>  If you want to become a programmer </h3><br>  I have a few recommendations for those who also want to change the scope of work and go into the development: <br><br><ul><li>  Basic advice: go not for money, but for what is interesting.  Listen to yourself - what do you want to do?  This applies to the choice of the company, and the choice of direction, and even the choice of the project - if it is.  If you do what you like, all efforts will pay off. </li><li>  Do not try to master everything alone.  Ask questions, discuss a new area for you with those who understand it or, like you, are just learning.  This will help to develop faster. </li><li>  Visualize your ideas.  It was very difficult for me to imagine how the program works, and to keep everything in my head.  It helps visualization - the whole logic or part of it.  I use the draw.io tool.  There you can write texts, create flowcharts, connect them together - very convenient. </li><li>  Rather obvious advice, but at the very start it can be useful: program using the development environment.  When, after a few weeks of training, I put IntelliJ IDEA, I was pleasantly surprised at how comfortable and pleasant it was to work. </li><li>  Learn not only what you need, but also what you want.  If you want to switch or more deeply understand some topic - do not pull yourself down.  Do not be afraid to take a step aside.  So you will learn the base with great pleasure, and if there are gaps, then fill them in.  I remembered words from a single video on YouTube: if you are flipping through a Java tutorial, scrolling is not where you want, but where it‚Äôs interesting. </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/446632/">https://habr.com/ru/post/446632/</a></p>
