The event was very rich and interesting, as always, but now it is a little about something else.  In addition to all the traditional attributes of conferences, there was an interactive whiteboard TeamBoard.  So I had a chance to poke my hands in the enemy miracle of technology myself ... <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  All the work of the system is described in one word - logical.  Everything is thought out from the point of view of logic, which sometimes conflicts with intuitiveness.  But even this does not spoil the impression of work. <br><br>  So, everything looks more than solid: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3c0/b8c/173/3c0b8c173b3a70d8dc9da1c282843d39.gif" alt="image"><br>  A large board, with a very bright short-focus projector (if you don‚Äôt know the details, not everyone understands where the picture comes from), with a set of buttons at the bottom of the screen and with the possibility of adjusting the board height (electrolift).  The projector is positioned so that it practically does not give shadows when a person works at the blackboard.  The screen taps are tracked using resistive technology.  Buttons allow you to choose the color of the marker.  Ta-dam!  When you select this tool, the following happens: the screen shot becomes the next slide in the program attached to this complex.  It is logical, but you have to get used to it.  First knocks.

      The first thing that almost all IT professionals did was checking what would happen if they used not one hand, but two.  The answer turned out to be logical, but not obvious - the system calculated the average position for the cursor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/096/cfd/d8c/096cfdd8c674a277f10b7a6cad31d2c2.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The signal comes from the podium speaker, which is a laptop and touch screen.  It is understood that the laptop is closed and everything is controlled through the board or screen with the same success.  The tribune is very comfortable, but it is much more pleasant to poke a finger into the board. <br><br>  If you use standard programs for the presentation of presentations, it is difficult to fully use the advantages of the board, it takes practice to understand which application is being used at a particular point in time.  If you use native software, you can enjoy all the possibilities of managing slides, drawing on them and other trifles. <br><br>  Seen cons: <br><ul><li>  The touch screen on the podium is not very sensitive. </li><li>  It is inconvenient to click off the slides in the presentation back, if you do not use special devices or laptop keyboard. </li><li>  In order to more fully use all the properties of the board, the presentation slides need to be overtaken into the program that comes with the board, respectively, the benefits of the presentation programs are lost. </li></ul><br><br>  Nevertheless, this device significantly adds life to the communication of the speaker with the audience.  When the board was used, there was a feeling of closer communication, the speaker seemed to become like one of the participants, it was easier for him to ask questions and it was easier to discuss. <br><br>  Probably it is for these feelings that people are ready to pay. <br>  If you know about such opportunities in advance, you can significantly diversify the presentation formats.  In general, I really liked it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/96282/">https://habr.com/ru/post/96282/</a></p>
