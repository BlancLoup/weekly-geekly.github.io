What is, what I would like and how to</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good all the time of day! <br>  For several months now I have been working at the forestry college in Ulan-Ude.  And although my position is still called ‚Äúelectronics engineer‚Äù, but I fulfill the functions, it seems to me, of a system administrator, enikei, ‚Äúspecialist‚Äù in cable laying, installation of sockets, another photographer, video operator, etc.  etc. <br><br>  At once I will make a reservation that this topic was written at the request of the user <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/muradin/" class="user_link">MuRADiN</a> , which he expressed in a comment on this <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/study/132498/">article</a> .  It will have more questions than answers, because  He thought first of all with an eye to the fact that knowledgeable people will prompt some solutions and point out mistakes.  Well, and I hope that for beginners "system administrators" of my level (especially working in education) as well as computer science teachers, something will be useful. <br><br>  Next, I will talk about what has been achieved, what I would like to receive, and ask questions that may be interesting for someone to answer.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  Initial data </h5><br>  When I arrived, the situation looked like this: <br>  <u>Number of PCs:</u> <i>About 120 (inventory was not conducted at the highest level, ‚Äúpaper-based‚Äù, so the exact number is still unknown)</i> <br>  <u>Network:</u> <i>Peer to Peer.</i>  <i>Not all are connected to the network, but 60%. Using both switches and WI-FI routers.</i> <br>  <u>Internet:</u> <i>ADSL, 4 Mbit / s</i> <br>  <u>Proxy server:</u> <i><a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid">Squid</a> + SquidGuard on FreeBSD</i> <i><br></i>  <u>DHCP server:</u> <i>no</i> <br>  <u>Users: The</u> <i>majority of workers are people of ‚Äúaverage‚Äù and ‚Äúabove-middle‚Äù age with a very low level of ‚Äúcomputer literacy‚Äù.</i>  <i>College students are, for the most part, children from dysfunctional families, dubious companies, poorly studied or did not complete their education at school, etc.</i> <br>  Naturally, there is no domain, licensed software is practically not used (partly due to the fact that many people don‚Äôt know whether it‚Äôs licensed or not, partly due to the lack or inefficient use of funds, and partly due to the large workload of teachers who In connection with the latest <s>idiotic</s> reforms in education, it is simply not up to this), there is no separate room for the ‚Äúelectronics engineers‚Äù (there are 2 of us), which could be disassembled, assembled, vacuumed or anything else.  We have to work in the back room of the informatics office, the owner of which is very upset when there is a different "trash" there.  There is a server 1C-school on a machine with Windows XP, on the same machine shared folders for the entire network (!).  Moreover, they come into these folders because of the limitations of XP on the principle of "who had time, that, and sneakers ...", and who did not have time, they curse the "programmers" and complain that the network does not work. <br>  ZP makes ~ 13 thousand rubles, the working day is from 8:00 to 17:00 <br><br><h5>  What is done </h5><br>  - A conversation was conducted using obscure words and pictures, during which they managed to convince the authorities of the need for a domain.  Ordered (and now already received 2 licenses for windows server 2008 r2 and licenses to connect to it).  Ordered, approved, but not yet (need to hold a tender) is not bought hardware for these servers. <br>  - It was proved the need for a separate room.  Though with difficulty, we were given the same room in the basement. <br>  - On the computers of common use in the library and self-training room of the hostel are installed OS Xbuntu linux and Lubuntu linux (computers are old), which made it possible to do at least some groundwork for introducing OSS in college. <br>  - Inside the network, an IT-department portal was organized, which hosted: The page of electronic applications to the department, news and announcements of the department, instructions for users.  After authorization, administrators on the same page have access to the links to the web interfaces of the mail server (on FreeBSD) and the intranet jabber server. <br>  By the way, this portal is implemented on <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drupal">Drupal for</a> <b>free by</b> my friend <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/qindman/" class="user_link">qindman</a> . <br>  Thank you very much, Andrew! <br>  <i><u>It looks like this:</u></i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/205649e1/ac06ab5b/5e0259bc/e00c4643.jpg"><br>  - The promotion of open source software and explanatory work with colleagues began, that if Windows is licensed (like any software) <br>  - Teachers were given application forms for software for educational classes in order to bring everything to a common denominator and avoid misunderstandings like ‚ÄúI asked for the program but you didn‚Äôt give it to me‚Äù.  In addition, this list is easy to analyze and identify software that can be replaced by free, for example. <br>  - In one of the classrooms it turned out to deal with MAC OS on MacMini and make timid attempts to push the teacher to use them in training (so far unsuccessful) <br><br>  It all goes tight, creaking, but it goes.  What and happy. <br><br><h5>  Future plans and questions: </h5><br>  - <u>Of course, I want a full-fledged domain with AD and roaming profiles (there is no practical experience in organizing a domain, but you have to start sometime ...)</u> <br>  Question: Should each student make a separate account?  Or is it enough to make several types (for example, ‚Äústudent_I-kurs‚Äù, ‚Äústudent_II-kurs‚Äù)? <br>  - <u>I would like to correctly determine which servers will be on physical PCs, and which ones will be on virtual ones.</u> <br>  In particular: <br>  1) Win server 2008 r2 (by the way, there are 2 of them, how best to use this fact?) <br>  2) 1C-school <br>  3) Clonezilla server with the ability to network boot through it <br>  4) Proxy <br>  5) Web server with portal <br>  6) Test Server "SM-test" (lightweight, can work just on the desktop) <br>  7) Something like <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeNAS">FreeNAS</a> (for backups and file storage, for example. Is it worth it?) <br>  8) mail server (postfix) <br>  - <u>Raise the DHCP server, make domain authorization for the proxy</u> <br>  - <u>Make free WI-FI for students on the campus with a shaper, to limit the speed</u> <br>  - <u>Translate college to libre / open office</u> <br>  If you succeed in doing this, then the majority of non-learning PCs can be transferred to linux almost painlessly for users (will it be necessary to give up, perhaps, some of the features of the wine server?) <br>  - <u>Gradually replace varezny software with licensed software, having formed in the minds of colleagues and students that it is not good to <s>steal the</s> use of pirated programs, as well as to notify about alternatives</u> <br>  There is a thought to organize something like a mug or courses for everyone, where you can talk about free analogues of the usual software, about using Linux at home, about some of the simplest ways to protect against viruses, etc. <br>  - <u>Implement software inventory method</u> <br>  I look while in the direction of <a href="http://www.spiceworks.com/">SpiceWorks</a> , but maybe there is something better? <br>  - <u>Fly to space</u> (joke :)) <br><br>  Maybe I forgot something or missed? <br>  Who cares about these thoughts, who went through this or just, like me, looks and gains experience, please speak in the comments. <br>  Thanks for attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/132857/">https://habr.com/ru/post/132857/</a></p>
