  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Symbian is dead, but 808 PureView is not yet!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, Nokia officially announced that it will no longer produce smartphones on the Symbian software platform, and the Nokia 808 PureView camcorder will be its latest device on this operating system.  Well, this is at least a decent code!  It is also possible that on February 25, the first day of the MWC 2013, Nokia will present an analogue of the 808 model, but on the basis of WP8.  In any case, such statements are likely to affect the price of 808 PureView and this unique device will become more accessible.  To those whom the Symbian platform can scare off on this smartphone, I‚Äôm addressing my full review of the 41-megapixel camera phone, which I‚Äôve been using for six months.  I am sure, thanks to this device, Symbian will live long enough! <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d84/88b/6d7/d8488b6d7d7d25a78b04eba3f1892603.jpg" alt="image">

      I admit, the Nokia 808 PureView is my first Symbian smartphone.  Simba, I preferred Maemo-MeeGo, I looked closely at the N8, but the lack of Full HD video stopped me.  Of course, I heard that Symbian is a bad, unpromising platform.  Although, the N8 was at my good friend, and she did not seem to complain.  On the other hand, she was interested in telephony and photo-video capabilities of this device, so her opinion could not be fully authoritative. <br><br>  When the Nokia 808 Pureview came to my test for the first time last summer, I, who was used to the MeeGo interface, were slightly surprised.  How can one and the same company make devices with such a different user interface?  But then, when the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/153161/">Nokia Belle FP2 update came in October</a> , the situation got better for the better.  But I still continued to use N9 as the main smartphone, and the Nokia 808 PureView used it as a camera with 3G, which you can always shoot something on and then post it on the social network. <br><br>  From social networks to Nokia Belle (aka Symbian), of course, there is no Instagram.  Like many people, I like Instagram, and it doesn‚Äôt scare me that my pictures posted on my account can be slyammed somewhere.  In such a quality, in which it converts photos of Instagram, there is no place to lampe them by and large.  If someone really likes a photo, he will most likely write to me asking him to buy an original photo from me.  Talk about what to say in Instagram not to see the quality of the PureView-camera is also not entirely true.  It‚Äôs all the same to see, on the one hand, and on the other, it may not necessarily be considered?  Strictly speaking, for PureView there is Flickr.com, which, by the way, is now undergoing the action of providing a free pro account for 3 months.  And on Flickr, photos are uploaded from the Nokia 808 PureView directly from the Gallery interface. <br><br>  So, going back to Instagram, I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DFHCAOnP9EDo">mastered the following method</a> : <br><br>  In general, to be honest, I believe that at the moment, the Nokia 808 PureView and Nexus 7 bundle is the perfect set of mobile devices.  If the Nexus 7 without a 3G module (and I have one), then you can distribute Wi-Fi from the Nokia 808 PureView using the built-in JoikuSpot program.  In all other cases, to find a smartphone as comfortable for games or browsing, as comfortable for this Nexus 7, is practically no chance.  Nexus 7 fits into any pocket.  In addition, if you need to call, you will not have to get some ‚Äúshovel‚Äù, and the Nokia 808 PureView is a very compact device.  There is one more important plus for this set: the capacity of the batteries of these two devices is more than enough for two days. <br><br>  Not all right, back to the Nokia 808 PureView.  I already wrote a lot about this device and about PureView technology in general, both on Habr√© and in <a href="http://www.gazeta.ru/techzone/2012/08/07_a_4715877.shtml">Gazeta.ru</a> , and <a href="http://revazrezo.wordpress.com/">in my blog</a> .  And I will probably write a lot more, since all sides and nuances of this device, both as a camera phone and as a smartphone, which 400 people have been doing for 5 years, could hardly be fully tested in six months. <br><br>  In the summer, testing the Nokia 808 PureView, I decided that the video review of this device should be divided into 3 parts: general characteristics, camera and smartphone component.  And recently, I finally wrote down the third part of this review.  I believe that these 3 parts describe the Nokia 808 PureView quite fully.  Therefore, I decided to post them, bringing together in one post. <br><br>  Part 1: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fannotation_id%3Dannotation_854130%26feature%3Div%26index%3D38%26list%3DPL27DE99764ACE7D96%26src_vid%3D6NalG_ZTHoc%26v%3DP6H4o1rn0_E">general characteristics</a> . <br><br>  Part 2: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fannotation_id%3Dannotation_127206%26feature%3Div%26index%3D9%26list%3DUUyv_KDdNdaZ0cn_85pcLXTw%26src_vid%3D6NalG_ZTHoc%26v%3DQdchaIMGun0">Camera</a> <br><br>  Part 3: the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D6NalG_ZTHoc">smartphone component</a> <br><br>  Let's see if Nokia will present an analogue of the Nokia 808 PureView on Windows Phone 8 on the MWC 2013, but even if it does, it will only make the 808 model price more affordable, which is good news because no one will be able to provide this quality mobile photo for a long time another smartphone. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/167945/">https://habr.com/ru/post/167945/</a></p>
