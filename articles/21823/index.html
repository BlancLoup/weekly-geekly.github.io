At least, this conclusion is reached by experts on the World Wide Web.  Overseas, MySpace and FaceBook records are breaking, the Russian project Odnoklassniki.ru, not alien to Ukrainian users, seems to have already crossed the 10 million mark of registered participants. <br><br>  However, the regulars of the Forum of the Internet newspaper " <a href="http://www.fraza.ua/">Phrase</a> " have their own, special opinion about the possible downside of such projects.  Im a word. <br><br>  pravdivets: ‚ÄúOfficially Odnoklassniki.ru is a site for alumni meetings, but in fact, the site‚Äôs purpose is deeper: according to the site‚Äôs data databases on the users are naively laid out about themselves.  Moreover, the users themselves and fill out a dossier on themselves.  In addition to general information, which is not so important in this project, users fill out information about their connections - this is precisely the information for which the FSB organized this project.

      After a series of messages on the Internet, about who is behind this project, the FSB agents broke into a real hysterical attempt to hide their intentions.  Everything is used: from dirty insults and hysterical screams to attempts to impart to this incident a tinge of absurdity and enlist the revelations in the "UFO" section.  Such behavior once again indicates that the FSB is behind the "classmates" project. <br><br>  It should be noted that the "classmates" is not the only project of this kind.  Another project launched by the FSB: Linked-In and My World (mail.ru site).  [...] It is worth noting that the FSB is not the inventor of this idea.  The idea was carried out long before them by the google.com search engine in its mail.google.com where new users could receive an email account only by receiving a link from an existing user (this approach builds a tree of dating and connections). ‚Äù <br><br>  Uninvited guest: ‚ÄúWe must pay tribute - not a single Law in this case is violated: voluntarily posted information by the users can be used by KEM from the beginning.  And the FSB, and the Security Service of Ukraine and the CIA, and, sorry, your mistress!  [...] This is you hysterical, my dear man.  And in general: do not place anything there and sleep peacefully!  It will be necessary, and so you will find, believe me!  And if you and nafig are not needed by anyone, then no one will ‚Äúcatch‚Äù.  Well, and finally!  A brave chuzh SBU-Schnick did not think of this?  Or, again, on the ball - use the product created by the Russian guys, and do not say thanks?  After all, they use the same !!! ‚Äù. <br><br>  Sandor: ‚ÄúOnly in a fevered imagination can one imagine such a thing.  For as originally conceived by FSB professionals, such a project is not suitable for analysis.  It is precisely the correct connections that are not established, but a bunch of false connections.  This search engine analysis will not work.  It will be rubbish.  From any point to any, a mass heap of false trajectories will be found.  In other words, dummies. <br><br>  And the final processing in any case should be carried out by people.  And they will drown in this sea of ‚Äã‚Äãfalse connections.  Why do I speak so confidently?  Because he himself once engaged in trace systems.  True to the chips ... And the second.  And what prevents the FSB to oblige all admins of .ru domains to merge full information about each client?  What prevents to oblige all mail administrators to hand over all customer correspondence to a certain ‚ÄúKGB archive‚Äù?  Eh?  [...] In general, PR campaign bullshit.  Plain black bullshit.  [...] Estimate that media should be used to store all this garbage?  With megatons of files, pictures, music, upgrades, and the use of completely useless network bullshit.  How is a similar archive organized? ‚Äù <br><br>  SIVERJANYN: ‚ÄúAnalogous practice —ñ in us zad—ñyana.  Secret services ... Do not blame? " <br><br>  john_lennin: ‚ÄúI also heard that this is all the work of the special services!  Guys, think for yourself, it is so convenient to control the people who registered there!  The names and addresses are in the same place, a decent database comes out ... you know how many people are sitting there! ‚Äù <br><br>  Nemetz: "Yes, calm down, gentlemen, why make a garden, if there are passport offices and tax numbers." <br><br>  New Russia: ‚ÄúBut I deliberately avoid learning more about the virtual interlocutor than he tells about himself.  It‚Äôs not because I‚Äôm uninteresting, rather, because I‚Äôve been consciously trying to build my own virtual world lately so that I can come into contact with the real as little as possible. ‚Äù <br><br>  SHENDEROVICH: ‚ÄúI registered here on the website of the classmates under the nickname Seva Mogilevich, and at once there were so many classmates!  And in all corners of the globe! ‚Äù <br><br>  <strong>It seems funny to me.</strong> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/21823/">https://habr.com/ru/post/21823/</a></p>
