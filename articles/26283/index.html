  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Windows Podcasts</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Yesterday a letter with such content fell into my mailbox: <br><blockquote>  <em>Hello (te), flipped through the podcast and read that it‚Äôs right to download podcasts automatically and by subscription, but I didn‚Äôt find any podcast clients (aytyuns is a Lexus for storing a Pepsi jar).</em>  <em>I rummaged through all the Internet and accidentally found out that the bourgeoisie‚Äôs sei software devices are called podcast aggregators and only after that did he find a doppler.</em>  <em>There is NO ONE review of podcast clients in runet.</em>  <em>After all, before you properly start podcast, you need to properly listen to podcasts.</em>  <em>Of course, we get a certain reversibility and randomness in the presentation of information, but better than nothing.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>With best wishes and intentions to read another great article, well-wisher :)</em> </blockquote><br>  First, thanks for the nice letter!  :) And secondly - the author of the letter of rights.  It makes sense to use iTunes if you are an iPod / iPhone owner, but if not, it is wise to choose something easier and more convenient.  In the article " <a href="http://www.podcastim.ru/2008/05/podkasting-v-linux">Podcasting in Linux</a> ", variants of podcast clients for the respective OSs were considered, but we have not yet spoken about Windows. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I did not know where to start, so I will start with the Doppler already mentioned in the letter.  <a href="http://www.dopplerradio.net/">Doppler</a> is a simple podcast aggregator for the Windows platform, there is also a version for Windows Mobile.  The program is very simple and lightweight (480 kb), uses the .NET Framework.  All Doppler does is download the podcasts you need and add the latest files to any media player.  The idea is good, but the implementation is not very.

      Problems begin already during installation.  After standard Next ... Next ... the program will ask you to specify the folder where to download podcasts and the player to which files should be added.  You can select Windows Media Player, iTunes or any other through the Browse button.  On my system, the installation crashes with an error, if you reap this same Browse, so after a couple of unsuccessful attempts, you had to agree to Windows Media, and then change the settings in the program itself. <br><img title="doppler_podcast_aggregator" src="http://www.podcastim.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/doppler_podcast_aggregator.jpg" width="500" height="368"><br>  There are not many settings, but everything you need is there, the interface is simple and quite comfortable, but bugs and flaws spoil the whole impression.  The doppler crashed again (but without error, simple and quiet) when I removed the tick from the Doppler Test Channel at the moment of downloading (in the screenshot above).  No, guys, this will not work ... <br>  <strong>...</strong> <br><img title="juice_logo" src="http://www.podcastim.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/juice_logo.gif" width="116" height="128">  Now let's try something more positive :) <a href="http://juicereceiver.sourceforge.net/"><strong>Juice</strong></a> developers chose lemon for their program and explain their choice very simply - with Juice you will always have the freshest content, as fresh as a bright yellow lemon.  Juice is functionally richer than the previous program, and much more popular too.  At the moment, the soft has 2.5 million downloads!  Mac users will be happy here too - there is a version for MacOS X, but the GNU / Linux version is still in development.  Anyway, Juice is a wonderful free cross-platform product written in Python.  This is an open source project, so anyone can join the development. <br><br>  What can the program do?  In addition, of course, download podcasts by RSS-subscription, Juice can do it on a schedule.  ‚ÄúLemon Juice‚Äù can work with BitTorrent - if, of course, the podcast is distributed in this way.  Downloaded files can be automatically played on the computer or uploaded to any player, including the Apple iPod. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c47/a6a/ac9/c47a6aac9128e68701bc89798ca80faa.gif" width="533" height="455"><br>  The default program has a small directory of English-language podcasts, but this list can be easily edited.  You can make a full catalog RPOD.ru on your computer! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c2f/d71/11f/c2fd7111f7d8bc604b43f9b95f468944.gif" width="535" height="450"><br>  In general, I personally advise you to try this particular positive program. <br>  <strong>...</strong> <br>  Go ahead.  <a href="http://www.jpodder.com/"><strong>jPodder</strong></a> is almost the same in capabilities as a client written in Java.  Version 1.1 is available for Windows, 1.0 for Linux.  Low weight program, can hide in the system tray, also has a built-in podcast directory, can read tags from iTunes. <br><br>  There is a scheduler - you can assign the date and time of download, flexible download settings.  Can work through a proxy. <br><img src="http://www.jpodder.com/jpodder/imaging/jpodder-intro.gif" width="300" height="237"><br>  Out of the box can use iTunes and Windows Media for playback, has plug-in support, so connecting to another popular player won't be a problem.  In general, everything seems to be there, the choice is a matter of personal taste. <br>  <strong>...</strong> <br>  <strong><a href="http://www.nimiq.nl/">NIMIQ</a></strong> is a pleasant development, but unfortunately for a long time there have been no new releases.  The last blog entry on the site dates back to January 2006 ... But, in principle, the program is working, you can even use it! <br><img src="http://www.pentdego.com/images/2004/12/07/nimiq09.jpg"><br>  Nothing unique or very remarkable, Nimiq does its job - it downloads podcasts by subscription.  The program is more like a rocking chair, rather than an RSS-aggregator. <br>  <strong>...</strong> <br>  Further down the list is a program with a geek interface :) Personally, it reminds me of <a href="http://www.foobar2000.org/">foobar</a> .  It is called <a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/lance/articles/PPR.aspx">Primetime Podcast Receiver</a> , it sounds solid, agree. <br> <a href=""><img title="ppr_index" src="http://www.podcastim.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/ppr_index.png" width="500" height="296"></a> <br>  The program works easily with Windows Media and iTunes, but it can also play audio and video files on its own.  Scheduler can download files at the appointed time, can delete old files.  There is a cool feature that I personally would need right now - you can mark any number of podcasts as already listened, so that the program does not shake them, and your eyes will not be sore.  PPR can automatically update the RSS address if it has been changed. <br><img title="ppr_main1" src="http://www.podcastim.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/ppr_main1.png" width="500" height="265"><br>  Very nice features, but the interface is scary :) If it doesn't scare you, go ahead, be sure to try.  Yes, I forgot to say, this program has also not been updated for a long time, for three years already ... But good programs are like beautiful women, over the years ... ahem ... (I realized that the crap began ...) <br>  <strong>...</strong> <br>  <a href="http://www.dorada.co.uk/">RSSRadio</a> is a cute program distributed in two versions - paid and free.  In my opinion, this is not a good solution, but somehow the free version has full functionality for 30 days, after which it refuses to work. <br><img title="rssradioscreen2" src="http://www.podcastim.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/rssradioscreen2.gif" width="500" height="327"><br>  What can RSSRadio?  All the same, that its free colleagues - recovery of downloading after failure, BitTorrent, integration with iTunes and WMP ... But there are rare functions, for example, support jRiver Media Center, playing or viewing podcasts online, without downloading, context menu in IE and Firefox. <br>  The program has such a model that any third-party developers can write plugins for it.  The authors, apparently, relied on widespread popularity, but did not receive it, but the program remains a good option. <br>  <strong>...</strong> <br>  <a href="http://www.ziepod.com/">ziePOD</a> has some nice features, such as listening to / viewing files online, a handy video panel, a podcast rating system, limiting download speeds, a kind of skin, task scheduler and iPod support.  Habrayuzer <a href="http://tven.habrahabr.ru/">tven</a> tells about one drawback - when you continue downloading after a pause, the file is re-streamed. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/099/35e/fde/09935efde8abdd37b7bf0a585a088d17.gif" width="464" height="142"><br>  <strong>...</strong> <br>  <a href="http://www.podcastready.com/download.php">Podcast Ready myPodder</a> - the program is very interesting.  The main feature - the program runs directly from the mp3-player!  You just need to connect the player to the computer, run myPodder from there and all the fresh podcasts are automatically downloaded to the device.  There is also a version without this function - a simple AutoPodder podcast aggregator (on the same page) <br>  <strong>...</strong> <br>  <a href="http://raphb.ch/c/synclosure">Console RSS-aggregator</a> .  No comments :) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fb7/dcb/094/fb7dcb094176b40ed8867475cf74ae04.gif" width="575" height="88"><br>  <strong>...</strong> <br>  Well, the last thing worth talking about is a small plugin for iTunes.  Many people do not use Apple iTunes because of its slowness, but some like it, but for podcasts it is convenient to use it only if you have a player of the same company - iPod (or iPhone).  <a href="http://www.badfruit.com/"><strong>Bad Apple</strong></a> plugin makes iTunes see any mp3 player! <br><img title="badapple" src="http://www.podcastim.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/badapple.jpg" width="500" height="296"><br>  <strong>...</strong> <br>  In this review, only the ‚Äúclean‚Äù podcast clients were presented.  There are many RSS-readers with the ability to read podcast-RSS-feeds, but this is a topic for a completely different conversation :) <br><br>  <a href="http://www.podcastim.ru/2008/05/podkast-klienty-dlya-windows/">Original on podkastim.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/26283/">https://habr.com/ru/post/26283/</a></p>
