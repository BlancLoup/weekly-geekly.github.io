      <b>The first artificial island of Dubai</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f12/dc5/0ca/f12dc50cac6525c0374dc2545d218779.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  You probably saw the Palm Jumeirah in photographs or with your own eyes while visiting Dubai.  Despite the controversial views on the man-made island, we have to agree that the construction of the island was an incredible achievement. <br><br>  It was assumed that the palm tree, which emerged from nowhere, will become a new attraction on the coast of a rich emirate.  Dubai‚Äôs view of the incredible residential complex was partly formed by Van Oord (Van Oord), a Dutch company specializing in dredging, construction and land reclamation of the maritime industry.  These skills enabled the company to become the ideal partner for such a daunting task. <br><br>  Over the past 10 years, Van Oord system integrator Koning &amp; Hartman (Koning and Hartman) has equipped KVM ships with devices.  And for this there are good reasons.  Spraying 94,000,000 cubic meters of soil and sand to the destination requires precise planning. <br><br>  Using state-of-the-art equipment, engineers monitor and control various processes on board a ship.  Accurate mixing of soil and sand, pump speed and the movement of robotic arms are just some of the aspects that play an important role in the development of the earth, and therefore must work flawlessly. <br><br>  In other words: great team responsibility, a large amount of equipment that needs to be managed and controlled, and a small space on the bridge.  Ideal KVM hardware requirements. <br><br>  <b>KVM equipment helped in the construction of the island of Palm Jumeirah</b> <br><br>  Through the use of KVM Guntermann &amp; Drunck extenders, computers can be moved from the bridge to a separate server room.  Despite the separation, computers in the server room are still available thanks to KVM extenders.  Extenders, equipped with a mouse, keyboard and monitor, allow the team on the bridge to control their computers remotely. <br><br>  Considering the size of the ships, there is a long distance between the server room and the bridge.  But this aspect should never be the cause of poor video quality.  To fulfill this requirement, KVM extenders connect the bridge and the server room, while the video quality of the image remains at a high level. <br><br>  <b>Marine and surface KVM installations:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/02d/977/512/02d977512bfe0ce7f2b77f1851f7a9c1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  1. KVM Matrix Switch <br><br>  2. KVM user station - KVM user station <br><br>  3. KVM extender: sender - KVM extension (transmitter) <br><br>  4. KVM extender: receiver - KVM extension (receiver) <br><br>  Bridge - Command Bridge <br><br>  Server room - server room <br><br>  Control room - operator <br><br>  CAT-x or fiber optics - CAT-x cables or optical fiber <br><br>  The KVM matrix switch allows the team to access multiple computers from their workstations.  Now they can easily control and manage their equipment. <br><br>  In addition, space is made available on the bridge, and computers no longer heat the room.  However, it is not only the team that benefits from moving computers from workstations.  In separate server rooms, computers work in accordance with the requirements: in a cool, dry room with a minimum amount of dust. <br><br>  The team still has access to computers in real time.  In the event of an emergency, everyone will be able to respond quickly.  Backup parts in devices provide even more security.  In the end, it is assumed that a failure in any of the devices will not result in stopping the workflow. <br><br>  <b>Palm tree, which grow palm trees!</b> <br><br>  After the construction of the island of Palm Jumeirah was fully completed, it looked pretty deserted.  Today, the island is decorated with hotels, villas and apartments.  In the gardens of the houses grow palm trees, which seem to thrive on the island in the form of palm trees. <br><br>  The once deserted island turned into a little paradise.  Therefore, it is not surprising that we are proud that our equipment played a small role in the construction of the island. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/242867/">https://habr.com/ru/post/242867/</a></p>
