Decent sound, crazy autonomy and proprietary application.  All this for reasonable money! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6e4/e59/8bd/6e4e598bde634241a639858b0660c686.JPG"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In my opinion, such a pathetic beginning is quite justified.  The headphones that I got were very worthy.  But I want to start with the least obvious - the application. <br><br>  Croise.R can be paired with a smartphone and in the traditional way - via Bluetooth.  However, the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.partron.headset">App for Android</a> is also written for these headphones.  On the one hand, you can‚Äôt be surprised with headphones for which there is software, but the vast majority of them are all in the Sport category: Jabra, Samsung IconX, Bragi and some others.

      Immediately application of a different kind.  Its main task is to optimize the reception of notifications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cc6/983/b23/cc6983b23cad40ff861964fb95cfcdf5.jpg"><br><br>  The function seemed useful to me, especially since I repeatedly encountered the fact that when walking the vibration in my pocket becomes imperceptible, and by ear, of course, listening to something in the headphones, extraneous sounds are perceived in any way. <br><br>  Here you can also connect some basic notifications, including those from popular instant messengers: Telegram, WatsApp, and some others.  Also, the vibration motor is integrated into the case, which also performs the function of alerting, including the ‚Äúout of sync‚Äù with the smartphone. <br><br>  The application also allows you to customize the display, the volume of the built-in alerts, when a girl warns about the inclusion / connection of the headset or the charge level.  Well, not without "chips."  Using the application, you can control the camera. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ae4/ba3/60f/ae4ba360f1434eb2a93d7d2d93a58a88.jpg"><br><br>  To do this, however, you need to download another application, which will redirect the link inside the Croise App.  If you use this function, then holding the "+" button performs the action of the shutter. <br><br>  Also in the application you can get information about the connection status and charge level. <br><br>  <b>Autonomy</b> <br><br>  At one time it began to seem to me that they would work forever.  Listening to music in the ‚Äúhome-to-work‚Äù mode, an average of 2-2.5 hours per day, I lived on one charge for about a week.  In the mode of watching movies I had enough of them for 8 films, the average duration was also about 2 hours. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a0e/bf8/78b/a0ebf878b62545fea6478c5b386e5d3e.JPG"><br><br>  Inside the Croise.R battery is 195 mAh, and the charging time is about an hour from the mains.  Charged via Micro USB. <br><br>  <b>Sound</b> <br><br>  For a start it is worth saying a few words about the microphone.  Or microphones - two of them.  They work on the basis of technology CVC, which now seems to be owned by Qualcomm.  For the listener, this gives good advantages: the interlocutor hears me really well even under deliberately experimental conditions: near the road where cars drive, during fast walking, with wind, etc. <br><br>  Noise reduction at a very competitive level! <br><br>  Croise.R supplied with the codec Apt-X, which promises "CD quality over the air."  However, paired with smartphones for which this feature is not available, the headset also sounds great and copes quite cleanly with a range of 20 - 20000. <br><br>  I am not an attentive and sensitive listener, and if I read online, not every connoisseur will blindly distinguish one codec from another.  I used this model in several typical scenarios: streaming from VK, Metallica, movies.  I am pleased. <br><br>  <b>Appearance</b> <br><br>  Headphones with a similar design have come across from Samsung, for example.  And this design does not seem to me to be somehow, let's say, requiring some explanation.  The arc that holds the shape hangs on the neck.  From it depart the wires at the end of which the "droplets". <br><br>  At the junction of the speakers and the wires there is an extra small silicone gasket that prevents wear. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2a6/058/710/2a60587107874ad2bb1984a6fbe139f9.JPG"><br><br>  So that the capsules do not dangle, a pair of magnets are provided at the end of the headband, which can hold the speakers, giving the design a laconic look. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c64/b16/2ec/c64b162eccf14f1f8f5b4ef060789c23.JPG"><br><br>  On the case, all the main controls.  All of them are standard on the right bow.  The only thing that has always bothered me personally: the "+" and "-" button, in my opinion, should be reversed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0b1/26d/b77/0b126db773374ed2b2f733927db3714e.JPG"><br><br>  In my opinion, now in terms of price and quality, this is an amazing synthesis and the perfect combination.  Excellent sound, work 12 - 13 hours, a decent microphone and application, just in case, where you can set up notifications. <br><br><ul><li>  Cost - <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/croise-r-pbh-200.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dcroise.r%26utm_campaign%3Dcroise.r">2 590 rubles</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/402481/">https://habr.com/ru/post/402481/</a></p>
