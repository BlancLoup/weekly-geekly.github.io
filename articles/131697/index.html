This informative event was attended by over 300 people.  And almost everyone was present in the hall from the very beginning to the end of the conference, which once again confirmed the relevance and importance of the reports that were heard in the hall.  And to listen was that: ‚ÄúCheck-list layout‚Äù, ‚ÄúEditing HTML in the browser‚Äù, ‚ÄúBEM.  The real experience of two companies: Mail.Ru Group and HeadHunter ‚Äù- and this is only a small part of what was talked about on Web Standards Days in Minsk. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Such a global event could not do without competitions with the award winners.  Valuable prizes from <a href="http://active.by/">Active Technologies</a> received three participants who best animated the Active Cloud logo using HTML, CSS and JS - each of them won a certificate for the Cloud Hosting service worth 1,000,000 Belarusian rubles.  At the close of "The Days of Web Standards", as promised, the winner of the <a href="http://webstandardsdays.ru/browser-war/">"Browser Wars"</a> was announced - a competition held in October by Mail.Ru Group.  Unfortunately, the best of the best could not come to Minsk, so the award (Apple iPad 2) was sent to his hometown, but for now all the other contestants who were present in the hall were awarded professional literature from the <a href="http://oz.by/">OZ online store. by ‚Äù</a> and companies <a href="http://lovata.com/">LOVATA Group</a> .  Also, books on IT topics from the OZ.by online store were awarded to the authors of the questions, which, in the opinion of the speakers themselves, turned out to be the most interesting and thoughtful.

      <b>Acknowledgments</b> <br><br>  I am glad that a significant event in the IT sphere, organized by the association <a href="http://web-standards.ru/">‚ÄúWeb Standards‚Äù</a> together with the LOVATA Group, attracted so many visitors who listened attentively and actively debated, showed genuine interest and scribbled comments on Twitter in online mode.  By the way, <a href="http://telecom.by/">Atlant-Telecom</a> provided reliable, fast and stable Internet access to all those present.  The organizers of the Web Standards Days thank everyone who helped create and host this event: in addition to the companies mentioned above, they are <a href="http://opera.com/">Opera Software</a> , <a href="http://it.tut.by/">IT.TUT.BY</a> and <a href="http://jobs.tut.by/">RABOTA.TUT.BY</a> , the <a href="http://www.avalon.ru/">Faculty of Retraining SPbSPU specialists</a> . <br><br>  It is even more pleasant to hear sincere ‚ÄúThank you!‚Äù From those who were at the event, who received new knowledge and found a solution to long-standing issues of developing web applications.  As it turned out, this is not the only thing for which the organizers were thanked: during the conference, on the official hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/">#wstdays</a> , live event participants were <a href="https://twitter.com/">chatting</a> on Twitter, discussing reports, and finding work / employees and ... even acquaintances! <br><br>  <b>Apologies</b> <br><br>  Due to the impressive number of participants, there were some overlaps: some semblance of the queue for registration and an overdue online broadcast, which we managed to launch only after dinner (who could not watch the video broadcast, do not worry: the recording of all reports was conducted from the very beginning and will be available on the official event channel video service <a href="http://vimeo.com/channels/wstdays">vimeo.com</a> ).  The organizers apologize and hope that these moments do not overshadow the joy of communication. <br><br>  <b>Future plans</b> <br><br>  The success of the ‚ÄúWeb Standards Days‚Äù speaks for itself: such events will continue to be organized, each time covering the most topical issues of web development, gathering more and more people and promoting new ideas, solutions and technologies in the IT community ... And how could it be somehow different? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/131697/">https://habr.com/ru/post/131697/</a></p>
