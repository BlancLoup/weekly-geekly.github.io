      <b>How to release a great iOS application that someone needs</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/178273/">Rus</a> <br>  I will try to talk about how to release a great application that someone still needs, but which did not work. <br><br>  <b>Objective-C Runtime: Theory and Practical Application</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/177421/">Rus</a> <br>  Many people know that it exists, but what are its capabilities and how to use it in practice?  Let's try to understand the basic functions of this library. <br><br>  <b>In-app purchases - some statistics</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/179303/">Rus</a> <br>  In this post, I would like to share the collected data on In-App purchases in one of my games that will be useful to you if you are developing and / or promoting games for iOS, although I think that these figures can be easily applied to other platforms, such as Android. <br><br>  <b>Network caching in iOS.</b>  <b>NSURLCache</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/179349/">Rus</a> <br>  NSURLCache is a comprehensive solution for caching network requests in RAM or on disk.  In accordance with Apple's documentation, any request using NSURLConnection will be ‚Äúskipped‚Äù through NSURLCache. <br><br>  <b>Line removed the gift stickers on demand Apple</b> <br>  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/apple/line-ubrala-darenie-stikerov.html">Rus</a> <br>  Line earned about $ 60 million in the first quarter - about 30% of this, or about 18 million, is revenue from the purchase of paid stickers.  Most (about 50%) is the income from purchases within the games.  The representative of Line said that the company does not intend to restore the functionality of giving paid stickers in iOS. <br><br><h4>  Android </h4><br><br>  <b>PushSharp - Simple Push Notifications</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/178775/">Rus</a> <br>  The wonderful PushSharp library can send iOS, Android, Windows Phone and Windows 8 Push Notifications (it‚Äôs not in the description, but the PushSharp.Blackberry folder is in the source code, so maybe it is already working for this platform). <br><br>  <b>How to deal with low-quality Android applications</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/178673/">About developers</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/178713/">Android itself</a> <br>  This article is not only for beginners - many developers are well aware of the things described below, but do not pay enough attention, and someone knows Java and writes the most beautiful architecture, but does not know these little things.  This article is a request to the developers from the user. <br><br>  <b>Animoca: Android development is much simpler</b> <br>  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/google/animoca-razrabotka-dlya-android-uprostilas.html">Rus</a> <br>  Last year, Animoca's application testing process covered 400 different Android devices.  Today, their number has quadrupled, mainly due to the standardization in the industry of Android devices. <br><br>  <b>Programs for Android forbidden to update bypassing Google Play</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/178551/">Rus</a> <br>  Google updated the agreement with the developers, adding a special item addressed to the developers who are trying to update, change or replace the APK applications on their own or using third-party services. <br><br>  <b>As I wrote Pacman'a and what came of it</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/178037/">Part 1</a> / <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/178523/">Part 2</a> <br>  There was a desire to finish the game to the state when it can be put on the Google Play Market, although at the very beginning of the development I didn‚Äôt even think about it.  In addition, finishing to a playable state is a good exercise. <br><br>  <b>As I wrote Bomberman on Android</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/179991/">Rus</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/08a/e7c/cdf/08ae7ccdffb84470860da419075daaec.png"><br>  In parallel with the development of the game, he wrote tutorials on LibGDX, and constantly people asked to lay out the source code.  I decided to share them and tell a little about the development.  Maybe someone will help in the study of LibGDX. <br><br>  <b>Dr.</b>  <b>Tariff (tariffs and balance): How I began to help people save on mobile costs</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/drtariff/blog/179559/">Rus</a> <br>  I will tell you how Dr. Tarif was created.  This is an assistant who analyzes the statistics of your conversations and selects the ideal tariff plan.  Once launched, the application will examine in detail the history of your conversations and other costs to tell if you can spend less.  For one week, we were on our own in the TOP-10 free applications under the heading "Finance". <br><br>  <b>We include Samsung Multi Window in another application</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/179239/">Rus</a> <br>  The new Samsung smartphones have a very interesting feature - Multi Windows.  It allows you to simultaneously run two applications in one window.  Unfortunately, apart from Samsung, this feature is not yet supported by anyone.  But in fact, it is not so difficult to add to an existing application. <br><br>  <b>Why is it still cool to make mobile apps</b> <br>  <a href="http://blog.edward-kim.com/my-last-android-app-sales-figures-and-closing-thoughts-on-starting-an-android-app-business">Angl</a> <br>  The developer tells how he earns up to $ 57,000 per month on Android applications. <br><br>  <b>Protection of Android applications from hacking</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/179487/">Rus</a> <br>  In this article, we will briefly describe how you can protect your program from hacking without integrating a standard solution from Google and provide an example of a working code. <br><br>  <b>All developers can respond to reviews on Google Play</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/179575/">Rus</a> <br>  Now you can reply to comments through the Google Play Console and your responses will be publicly displayed under the corresponding review on Google Play.  Users, at the same time, will receive a notification by mail and will be able to respond to you. <br><br>  <b>How I chose Android for testing</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/179531/">Rus</a> <br>  The need for production raised the following two questions: how to determine the effectiveness of an existing set of devices for testing an Android application and how to correctly select the next device for testing. <br><br>  <b>Terms, jargon, and definitions of Android</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/179095/">Rus</a> <br>  Translation of terms taken from Android Terms, Slang, Definitions &amp; Guides. <br><br>  <b>A small multiplatform 2d tengine engine (android / win32 / freeBSD)</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/179839/">Rus</a> <br>  I believe that there are still a lot of people who like a nice and kind old school.  That's the whole mission - to write fun for the sake of something small, but quite functional, a platform for "console" toys in the style of 8/16 bits. <br><br>  <b>IntelliJ IDEA based on new Android Studio</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/JetBrains/blog/179815/">Rus</a> <br>  The IntelliJ platform, developed by JetBrains, became the basis for Google‚Äôs new product, Android Studio. <br><br>  <b>Google‚Äôs new features for developers: game APIs, translation and testing</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/apps4all/blog/179879/">Rus</a> <br>  At the Google I / O conference in San Francisco, Google announced a number of new features for developers. <br><br>  <b>Google Play for Education: educational applications and content for schools</b> <br>  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/google/google-play-for-education.html">Rus</a> <br>  Google announced an important new educational program that will manage the ways in which teachers ‚Äúdistribute‚Äù apps, books, and other educational materials on student tablets. <br><br><h4>  Windows phone </h4><br><br>  <b>Capabilities and examples of data from the Unified Mobile Platform of Moscow (UMB)</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/microsoft/blog/179085/">Rus</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/99b/855/7df/99b8557dfe1b8e82c258e1361158e498.png" alt="image"><br>  You can easily use the EMP API when building your applications for Windows 8 or Windows Phone.  I would say that now the process of integrating your applications with data and information services of the city of Moscow has become as simple as possible. <br><br>  <b>Lomogram Windows Phone Statistics</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/devrainsolutions/blog/179393/">Rus</a> <br>  On the Internet it is rare to find the latest statistics on the use of mobile applications, especially on Windows Phone.  I want to correct this situation a bit by sharing statistics compiled on the basis of the Lomogram application for Windows Phone and the Flurry service. <br><br>  <b>Improve the certification process for Windows Phone applications</b> <br>  <a href="http://wp7rocks.com/posts/details/8424">Rus</a> <br>  Microsoft has updated the Dev Center portal, improving some elements of the certification process for Windows Phone applications.  Consider in more detail. <br><br><h4>  Development </h4><br><br>  <b>How HTML5 video consumes battery power</b> <br>  <a href="http://iss.oy.ne.ro/HTML5-Video-Battery">Angl</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/80e/271/438/80e271438d9f04c3803790977cb63959.png"><br>  An excellent study that compares different formats and how they affect energy consumption. <br><br>  <b>Mobile application development: where to start</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mailru/blog/179113/">Rus</a> <br>  In our work, we go through all the stages of the life cycle of creating a mobile application, and I would like to share our experience in this area.  Below is a story about the basics of mobile development: from platform selection to creation, placement in a store and subsequent monitoring. <br><br>  <b>Parse opens its own hosting</b> <br>  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/applications/parse-hosting.html">Rus</a> <br>  Parse, a cloud-based application development platform recently acquired by Facebook, last week announced the release of a new product - Parse Hosting. <br><br>  <b>Touchscreen keyboard is not brother, mouse touchscreen is not sister</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/179567/">Rus</a> <br>  After much deliberation on the topic: ‚ÄúWhy management in many mobile non-casual games is so poor,‚Äù I finally realized that people developing it do not fully realize the uniqueness of the touchscreen as a platform, and partially or sometimes even completely copy control from the keyboard or at the worst with joystick. <br><br>  <b>Medio Launches Viral K-Invite Engine</b> <br>  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/applications/medio-k-invite.html">Rus</a> <br>  Given the cost of acquiring users, developers are now looking for the best ‚Äî and cheaper ‚Äî ways to attract players.  And the viral dissemination of data about applications or games is one of the best alternatives.  And here the company Medio offers a new product K-Invite. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/180203/">https://habr.com/ru/post/180203/</a></p>
