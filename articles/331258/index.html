  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Atmosphere at InfoWatch</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Dear friends, we suggest you take a sightseeing tour to the central office of InfoWatch and see for yourself where and how we work.  First, a little history: ‚ÄúThe InfoWatch group of companies is a Russian developer of integrated solutions for ensuring the information security of organizations.  The company was founded by Natalia Kaspersky in 2003 and today unites brands such as InfoWatch, Kribrum, Attack Killer, EgoSecure, Cezurity and Taiga.  For 2017, we have more than 20 divisions and representative offices in Russia, Western Europe, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East.  The head office of the company is in Moscow. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/94c/69d/531/94c69d5310c94d01baa5e25761ea219f.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And now more about the pleasant everyday details. <br><br>  InfoWatch headquarters is located in the west of Moscow in the business center "Verey Plaza-3" and covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äãmore than 5 thousand square meters.  meters  The company moved to the new office at the beginning of 2016, which was due to business growth and a significant increase in the number of staff.  Today, the company has more than 300 employees, about 200 of whom are located in the head office, the rest work remotely in other cities.

Different departments are located in the offices where everyone can creatively approach the design of their workplace. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/c4d/44b/50e/c4d44b50ea6742ed90659db3beaae9d2.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/4f3/e55/491/4f3e55491b16464baf318983d0e4dd63.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/9a8/8c8/6ad/9a88c86addbc4fa7b7367c59e73d73e1.jpg"><br><br>  The company has many meeting rooms for business meetings.  The names for the ‚Äútalks‚Äù in InfoWatch were collectively chosen: ‚ÄúWhat?  Where?  When? ‚Äù,‚Äú Kamchatka ‚Äù,‚Äú Tete-a-tete ‚Äù,‚Äú Parliament ‚Äù,‚Äú Corner ‚Äù,‚Äú Headquarters ‚Äùand so on.  When selecting names, a thematic approach was used, which allows you to intuitively determine the functionality of the meeting rooms or their territorial location. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/239/86b/728/23986b7283c74a7daca1fbafabf54bae.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/6e7/727/4ca/6e77274ca8fd45b4b9eaa0ac5cde025f.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to meeting rooms, there is a spacious conference room, where large meetings of the company take place, a survey of an educational project in the field of information security ‚ÄúKiberbataliya‚Äù, presentations, and even training and training, when some employees, having improved their skills and competencies, share knowledge and experience by colleagues. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/888/3e7/f9c/8883e7f9c5cd480c88b7f6225d7af9ad.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/471/2e9/518/4712e95181414721ac5b31996104fefd.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/6f7/598/56d/6f759856d3434e8aab44c71bd430827d.jpg"><br><br>  For the employees of the company created many opportunities that help in the work, as well as make the stay in the office as comfortable as possible.  For example, there are themed ‚Äúbooths‚Äù for personal telephone conversations, where you can talk on the phone in a quiet and cozy atmosphere without distracting your colleagues.  These zones are decorated in various thematic styles, including maritime, oriental, and even disco. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/271/716/c01/271716c01ebc40e598d63a4e9cbd6543.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/9a9/66b/73e/9a966b73e97c4433bdf578373a4adcdb.jpg"><br><br>  Employees of the company can take a break from work in a special game room equipped with a table for playing ping-pong, table football and hockey, as well as air hockey.  Recently, after holding a corporate table tennis tournament, shelves for the InfoWatch museum were installed in the gaming zone, where the winners' medals and cups are already stored. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e4d/c11/191/e4dc111919d449948bf2ab6b0ad40604.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/cb7/9b3/392/cb79b3392a7f4c0c961ce4540cbfc8a4.jpg"><br><br>  For those who want to be alone with themselves, collect their thoughts or bring a wardrobe in order, for example, to stroke a suit before a business meeting, a rest room is always available in the office.  The interior details, which are usual for home furnishings, are installed here, including a sofa, a table, a nightstand, as well as necessary household appliances, such as an iron, ironing board, mirror, needles and threads.  In the rest room, you can also stay overnight, in case an employee is late at work or arrives in Moscow from a regional office on a short trip.  For a night's rest, the necessary items are also provided: pillows, blankets and bed linen, which after each use is delivered by the company to the laundry room located on the first floor of the business center. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/d23/06c/e98/d2306ce98b3b468ea1e15fe3e681cffa.jpg"><br><br>  Recently, InfoWatch has equipped a massage room that is open daily.  In the conditions of intensive life in a large metropolis, the opportunity to receive high-quality medical and relaxing massage before or immediately after the working day is priceless. <br><br>  In the office InfoWatch constantly operates corporate gym, equipped with power and cardiovascular machines, changing rooms, showers and bathrooms with hair dryers.  A professional boxing ring is set up in the company's gym, where employees train and Thai boxing tournaments with partner companies take place.  You can study in the gym on your own or attend classes in boxing, functional training, fitball, dance mix and yoga. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/993/229/4a9/9932294a9d004d629bdf07e0a319fead.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/bfe/b0e/29a/bfeb0e29ae9b4092b052bfdb5be2a331.jpg"><br><br>  Especially for working parents, there is an opportunity to come to the office with the child - for this, the company has a separate ‚Äúchildren's corner‚Äù with toys. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/128/19e/437/12819e437fab41d89bc9509ec449ecb3.jpg"><br><br>  There is no special dress code in the company, and at the same time, employees understand that at external business meetings it is better to adhere to business style in clothes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/78d/350/b35/78d350b350464c2bbfa8abb9ec63a6b6.jpg"><br><br>  Many go around the office in slippers, which as part of corporate paraphernalia, give out to all employees on the very first working day, and then update as they wear out.  Even the corporate newspaper of a company that comes out monthly is called ‚ÄúInfoWatch Slippers‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/010/84c/cc5/01084ccc5c1048779d400091f7da0a73.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/f3e/452/24b/f3e45224b1a84b16bd4fe7c48ce133dd.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to slippers with a logo, each new employee receives a corporate ‚ÄúInfoPyutor‚Äù - a notebook for records, and a personal mug with corporate penguins. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/a7f/37e/2a0/a7f37e2a0a6a45a5b6cd6eca3b27acb6.jpg"><br><br><h3>  A little about the work schedule </h3><br>  For most specialties there is no strict start time of the working day, but, for high-quality working communications, there are mandatory attendance hours at the office: from 11:00 to 16:00.  Also in the company in coordination with the management the free schedule of work or distant work is possible. <br><br>  In addition, if the client or employee of the company does not have the opportunity to attend a particular meeting, it is carried out using video conferencing systems. <br><br>  For operational internal communication, corporate chat is used.  In addition to groups for discussing work issues, it also has various thematic sections, for example, for communication between people attending corporate volleyball or English classes.  There is even a separate informal chat where employees communicate on abstract topics. <br><br><h3>  And now about food and other amenities </h3><br>  The ‚ÄúCafe‚Äù zone is located in the center of the office, where hot breakfast and snacks are served, such as sandwiches or porridge.  There are also coffee machines, teapots, toasters, jars of jam and honey.  You can bring food with you, for this cafe is equipped with refrigerators and microwaves.  Recently, a dishwasher and an induction cooker have also appeared for cooking classes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/fff/0ce/746/fff0ce74643c409f889eb967f4ebba13.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/a0b/999/525/a0b999525bd740349862d3061dfa31c2.jpg"><br><br>  InfoWatch regularly hosts themed weeks, such as pancake, orange watermelon or berry.  In the cafe area, a game console, chess or backgammon, as well as drawing pictures ‚Äúby numbers‚Äù are available to employees. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/649/976/f87/649976f876674f7c94d6fdaa119fe846.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/a7b/a5a/ee8/a7ba5aee841a4cb0a08cc5406b8c0cd4.jpg"><br><br>  Another interesting feature: on the glass walls of a cafe you can draw or leave notes for colleagues. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/d58/09e/8e3/d5809e8e3a1f476bafd4d28c3cc3c5d2.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to delicious breakfasts and snacks, the company provides employees with full meals.  At the same time, they have the possibility of daily choice in which of the five cafes located on the territory of the complex, to have lunch this time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/77b/4b3/2be/77b4b32becb24356bea10ff9d4279b5d.jpg"><br><br>  The three main annual events at InfoWatch are the annual meeting, the New Year holiday and the company's birthday, which is celebrated in the middle of summer.  If the first event is communication on serious topics, with awards to the best employees and inspiration for labor feats, the other two are holidays for informal communication of colleagues and the realization of their talents on the stage.  Traditionally they are fun and noisy.  Since the company supports family values ‚Äã‚Äã(even one of the company's hashtags in social networks sounds like #infowatchfamily), then the events are held with children, who are affectionately called "InfoVyat". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/ac0/8e0/ce4/ac08e0ce42da47c0ba203de17043860a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/173/ab5/23c/173ab523c678499287735b987c839b29.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/c87/849/ae9/c87849ae9ae44fc0b8b89ad7648501a8.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, InfoWatch employees are united not only by corporate parties, but hobbies, for example, travel - on the world map located in the office, each employee can mark the cities he has visited.  And next door is the ‚Äúexhibition of badges‚Äù from conferences where company employees acted as speakers or were listeners. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/65b/ff6/208/65bff62081ec498487d8f16542922c85.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/34c/bb7/2e8/34cbb72e803f41369b6102efbb181aff.jpg"><br><br><h3>  A little bit about motivation </h3><br>  Employees of InfoWatch can attend English language courses right in the office, with which to choose - both with a native speaker and with a Russian-speaking teacher. <br><br>  The company encourages participation in forums and conferences, writing articles for professional blogs such as Habrahabr.  Besides the fact that employees share knowledge, this practice contains a motivational component, stimulates colleagues to create. <br><br>  The company is developing a mentoring program that facilitates easy adaptation of ‚Äúnewbies‚Äù. <br><br>  InfoWatch is participating in a student internship program.  90% of interns prefer to stay with the company after completing the course.  Some current leading InfoWatch specialists initially came to it as interns. <br><br>  We usually call ourselves a big family.  Even one of the symbols of the corporate culture was chosen penguin - a hardy, schooling bird, which in spite of difficulties and all the ideas about birds chose for itself the element of water, where it is now the only successful representative of its class. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/331258/">https://habr.com/ru/post/331258/</a></p>
