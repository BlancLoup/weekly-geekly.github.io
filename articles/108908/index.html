At the entrance, at the very bottom of the staircase, pretty girls stood next to the guard, checking that no stranger passed, naturally, the entrance was by invitation cards (which, by the way, were originally made on thick cardboard), on top was a crowd of journalists and which filmed on a camera and photographed practically all who rose.

      Going inside, the first thing that caught my eye was the DJs at the Runet Prize table.  The music played loudly, the girls from mail.ru carried the champagne to the guests.  A press conference was held right next to it, which was practically unheard of because of loud music playing. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/640/042/995/64004299546d0d92ed53cc34f3addf67.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b41/78d/08c/b4178d08ccd37139d0440ca710b41307.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c89/242/cb6/c89242cb66ef8b7f9aad6e21f6710aca.jpg"><br><br>  The ceremony was led by a journalist with Ekho Moskvy, Alexander Plyuschev and Tina Kandelaki, who did not part with the iPads handed over by the whole event; Tina also pointedly showed everyone her new iPhone 4, which she photographed on stage and talked to her mother during the broadcast. <br><br>  The ceremony and the truth was, as promised, somewhat "different", or as they said in advertising, "this time everything will be different."  At the very beginning, the Minister of Communications and Mass Communications Igor Schegolev opened the Runet Prize, who, first of all, the presenters asked themselves to take a demonstrative photo on Tina‚Äôs iPhone. <br><br>  The whole ceremony #premiaruneta was very similar to a solid "twitter-wall", the leading said the word "Twitter" at least 20 times.  Also, for the first time in the history of Runet, Tina Kandelaki sent a live tweet, after which many of those present in the hall also decided to ‚Äúlight up‚Äù on the screen.  President Dmitry Medvedev sent his congratulations through Twitter on the winners, who showed everyone present on the big screen "Unfortunately, I cannot personally congratulate the winners of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/premiaruneta/" class="user_link">Premia Runeta</a> . Therefore, in absentia. You are great, success to you!)" <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/premiaruneta/" class="user_link">Which</a> everyone was very pleased about. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/585/f2a/6a9/585f2a6a99fc17cf93097aff7aa1a1b1.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/111/a62/b9a/111a62b9ac8a28b350214dcfe17644e6.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bb5/2f4/771/bb52f477124e180c9787184dd4a748ca.jpg"><br><br><br>  Not without overlays, the WiFi Internet stopped working on mobile devices leading, the names of the winners appeared earlier or later, then in general, as happened with the site of the hockey club Dynamo Moscow - the name of the project was forgotten to write, which is what caused smiles in the hall.  Every 5-10 minutes, the presenter offered to follow his colleague Tina Kandelaki on Twitter, which in the end was not funny to anyone. <br><br>  As a result, though crumpled, the leaders named the winners in six nominations: "State and Society", "Culture and Mass Communication", "Science and Education", "Economy and Business", "Health and Recreation", "Technologies and Innovations" and also in two specials. <br><br>  The best co-ordination center for the national domain of the Internet is <a href="http://www.cctld.ru/">www.cctld.ru</a> , the volunteer project ‚ÄúMap of assistance to victims of fires‚Äù <a href="http://www.russian-fires.ru/">www.russian-fires.ru</a> and the portal for the protection of children on the Internet. " <a href="http://www.odindoma.org/">www.odindoma.org</a> <br><br>  For achievements in the field of culture and mass communications, the gold statuettes were awarded to the BBC Russian Service <a href="http://www.bbcrussian.com/">www.bbcrussian.com</a> , the national project You Are a Reporter <a href="http://www.reporter.rian.ru/">www.reporter.rian.ru</a> and the project <a href="http://www.ivi.ru/">www.ivi.ru</a> <br><br>  In the field of "Science and Education", the best became sites on the fundamental science "Elements" <a href="http://www.elementy.ru/">www.elementy.ru</a> and "Russian Wikipedia" <a href="http://www.ru.wikipedia.org/">www.ru.wikipedia.org</a> (winner of last year). <br><br>  In the fourth nomination - for the best project in economics and business - the winners were "OZON online store" <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/">www.ozon.ru</a> , accounting service website "My Business" <a href="http://www.moedelo.org/">www.moedelo.org</a> and the portal " <a href="http://www.sravni.ru/">Sravnim.ru</a> " <a href="http://www.sravni.ru/">www.sravni.ru</a> <br><br>  In the nomination "Health and Leisure" the portal about a healthy lifestyle "Takzdorovo.ru" <a href="http://www.takzdorovo.ru/">www.takzdorovo.ru</a> , the portal of the St. Petersburg Vodokanal "Da-voda" <a href="http://www.da-voda.com/">www.da-voda.com</a> , "Gastronom.ru" <a href="http://www.gastronom.ru/">www.gastronom.ru won out</a> and spetsnominatsiya site HC "Dynamo" <a href="http://www.dynamo.ru/">www.dynamo.ru</a> <br><br>  The winners in the nomination "Technology and Innovation" were Wi-Max operator Scartel LLC (YOTA) <a href="http://www.yota.ru/">www.yota.ru</a> , mail service mail.ru <a href="http://www.mail.ru/">www.mail.ru</a> and project "COMDI meeting online" <a href="http://www.comdi.com/">www.comdi.com</a> <br><br>  In addition, this year the contest organizing committee established a special nomination timed to the Year of the Teacher in Russia.  Within the framework of this nomination, the winners are the projects "Dnevnik.ru" <a href="http://www.dnevnik.ru/">www.dnevnik.ru</a> , "Philology.net" <a href="http://www.filologii.net/">www.filologii.net</a> and the project of the Department of Education and Science of the Kemerovo Region "Say thanks to your teacher" <a href="http://www.edu.kem.ru/">www.edu.kem.ru</a> <br><br>  The prize of the special nomination ‚ÄúNational Treasure‚Äù was awarded to Evgeny Kaspersky, and among the winners of the popular vote the leader was the game ‚ÄúLegend.  Legacy of the Dragons ¬ª <a href="http://www.dwar.mail.ru/">www.dwar.mail.ru</a> <br><br>  Each nomination was complemented by Alexander Plyushchev's words about the need to follow Tina Kandelaki on Twitter.  In the end, whether it was PR of Tina and her twitter, or awarding the Runet Prize. <br>  In general, I liked the Prize, but I think that it was better last year.  Well, let's see what will happen in 2011, time will tell. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/108908/">https://habr.com/ru/post/108908/</a></p>
