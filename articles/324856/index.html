Especially in the case when you play the role of a petitioner to a completely unfamiliar audience or person. <br><br>  Usually in such situations, no one is willing to listen to you for a long time - most likely you will have about 3-5 minutes to tell the essence of your idea, explain why someone needs it, who will implement it and, in fact, state the essence of your business offers.  There is a serious risk that during such an Elevator Pitch you simply will not be able to convey to the recipient's understanding even the essence of the project, not to mention its strengths and possible benefits. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      One of the possible means of reducing this risk is to build your speech or presentation on the basis of a clear, repeatedly approved plan (template).  It was this kind of advice that I received at one time from one of the residents of the Startupbootcamp Fintech accelerator after listening to my presentation.  The resident said that at one time they were helped by the template ‚ÄúThe Pitch Canvas‚Äù.  And indeed, by remaking the presentation in accordance with the template, I soon received an offer from the same accelerator (we, however, rejected the offer, but this is another story). <br><br>  For me, this was a more vivid confirmation of the effectiveness of presenting information in The Pitch Canvas format.  Indeed, presentations written according to this template are well logically connected, capacious, and extremely focused on results.  In this connection, I recommend The Pitch Canvas and to you, as a means to significantly ease the task of preparing for performances, as well as significantly increase your chances of success. <br><br>  Now, I occasionally take The Pitch Canvas as a basis not only in presentations related to financing or promotion, but also in cases when I just want to prepare some kind of small performance in principle (of course, some sections are irrelevant in this case, and they can simply be thrown out). <br><br>  The Pitch Canvas was created by Best3minutes (for those prone to advertising paranoia - I am in no way affiliated with this company, and never corresponded with any of its employees) and is distributed under a Creative Commons license (i.e. gift).  You can download from <a href="http://best3minutes.com/">the company's website</a> , or by <a href="http://best3minutes.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/The-Pitch-Canvas%25C2%25A9_V7_8.pdf">direct link</a> .  It is also worth noting that the template is gradually being updated and improved (a direct link leads to version 7.8 - that is, the document has changed many times).  For example, the version of the template I first used was somewhat different from the current one.  Compared with the old versions, the authors noticeably simplified the template, throwing out some sections from it and concentrating on the most important. <br><br>  I hope this simple A4 sheet somewhere will help you to win a small (and maybe a big) victory.  Good luck with your articles, presentations and speeches! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/324856/">https://habr.com/ru/post/324856/</a></p>
