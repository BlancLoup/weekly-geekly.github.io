  <section class="page js-page"><h1>On super-cheap laptops and how not to do business - Part III</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  And, actually, here.  Continuing the story of buying netbooks in China (the first two parts can be read <a title="On super-cheap laptops and how not to do business - Part I" href="http://t_rex.habrahabr.ru/blog/43160/">here</a> and <a title="On super-cheap laptops and how not to do business - Part II" href="http://t_rex.habrahabr.ru/blog/43161/">here</a> ). <br><br>  So, how did I get the device.  After I couldn‚Äôt track the devices on the DHL website using the Tracking ID provided, I had to unsubscribe the Chinese brothers again and find out how I could solve this problem and asked them for a copy of the documents they received from DHL when they were sent.  Oddly enough, but the scans of the documents they sent.  There, however, there was little that could be discerned, but some of the details and the Tracking ID itself seemed to be the same.  In addition, I was told that the package was already at the customs in Ukraine and a DHL representative should contact me soon.  I waited two more days, I was about to go to the office of DHL, but then they called me ... It turned out that in the parcel, besides the name and surname, the name of the company was also indicated, so the parcel would have to be received to a legal entity, but ... everything is wonderful, but I have no accreditation at the customs and therefore the parcel will not be returned to me (all legal entities who want to receive something ‚Äúfrom there‚Äù must be accredited. I did not know this because in the entire history of my purchases on the Internet the parcel never came to the legal entity ).  But okay, this is not scary, I had to ask the Chinese for clarification that the recipient is an individual.  The update was sent promptly, I was even surprised.  Literally in 2 days everything was decided. <br><br>  But if everything was so simple, it would not be interesting ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At the DHL office I was told that from September of this year, the size of the customs duty can be determined not from the actual cost of the parcel, but on the basis of the average assessment.  Those.  If, for example, the average cost of an imported laptop is around $ 600, then I will have to pay customs duty on the basis of this amount.  But perhaps it will be possible to convince citizens working in the appraisal department that the devices really cost not $ 600 and $ 200, for this they had to give the representative of DHL the address of the device manufacturer's website in order to make a printout and submit it to the appraisal department.  The site indicated the actual cost.

      OK, until the issue of evaluation is being resolved, it is necessary to go through a sanitary epidemiological station (SES) and radiological monitoring (I don‚Äôt know how it was originally intended, but in my opinion this is a relatively honest way for the government to select money from the citizens. Control in both instances takes place even without providing the package). <br><br>  Radiological monitoring hit during recess.  I was greeted by a kind auntie and offered to undergo control without registration in the accounting department.  It was necessary to resolve the issue urgently and I agreed.  Tetechka became richer for 25 hryvnia (approximately $ 5, the cost of official registration costs the same), and I received a seal on the air waybill.  In fact, everything happened so quickly that only when I came out of the building of radiological monitoring, I realized that I unwittingly contributed to the development of corruption in the country ... I still worry about this, I wanted to do everything honestly. <br><br>  Further ... SES ... In my opinion, the most bureaucratic bureaucrats are sitting in this institution.  In order to put the seal you need to provide a translation (Russian or Ukrainian) of the invoice and air waybill.  Without a translation, they refuse to put a stamp flatly.  I had to run to DHL and find out about the transfer.  It turned out that because  I go through control without the help of a customs broker, then I have to do the translation myself, but ... in order to provide a transfer to the SEC, it is necessary that the stamp of the organization authorized to make the translation of documents, for example the seal of some translation agency, stand.  But, of course, no one would do anything for free, and I also didn‚Äôt want to pay for a translation, which I can do myself.  I returned back to the SES, offered them to translate both documents with them using a program-translator (I always carry a laptop with me, so this thought seemed to me quite sound).  OK, agreed.  Opened the translator, began to translate.  And here again the fur animal quietly crept up :) On the invoice in the inventory, the laptops were listed as ‚ÄúLaptop‚Äù, and on the air waybill - ‚ÄúLpatop‚Äù.  Thanks to the Chinese brothers.  Checking SES in a rage, I'm in shock.  The explanations that a typo crept in here nobody wants to accept.  I have already lost hope of solving everything without going to a translation agency (except that you need to pay for translation services, the translation itself can take a couple of days, which is unpleasant), I decided to leave, but then the inspector saw that both documents the same Tracking ID and, nevertheless, put a seal (I don‚Äôt know how it happened, but for some reason I like the explanation of this situation more like the phrase ‚Äúfools are always lucky‚Äù, although, of course, the concept of ‚Äúluck‚Äù in this case can be challenged by the low indicators). <br><br>  So, I passed the control, brought documents with stamps in DHL.  But this is not all, you still have to go through the assessment department and customs.  Nevertheless, I decided to use the services of a customs broker, because if I started doing this myself, I most likely would not have had time before the date when the parcel should be sent back. <br><br>  And yesterday they called me and said that I could pick up the parcel, but first I had to pay the customs fee and the services of a customs broker.  The customs duty amounted to 1280 hryvnia (~ $ 256), the customs broker gave 415 hryvnia (~ $ 80).  As I learned in DHL, recently all the customs clearance services have become paid for them, the cost of services is 10% of the cost of the package.  Previously, when I worked with them, it was all done for free.  Those.  The total cost of customs clearance services was 504 hryvnias, this is ~ $ 100, but since I underwent SES and radiological monitoring on my own, it turned out cheaper. <br><br>  So, we consider the total cost: $ 1052 + 256 + 80 = 1388, divide by 5, we get $ 277.6 <br><br>  Too much, but still relatively good. <br><br>  Dragged the device home, began to check.  And then something happened that I was most afraid of.  One device did not want to boot.  Constantly goes into reboot. <br><br>  Then I remembered this thing, this time the check and opening of the package took place without my presence.  The first time is.  It is imperative that when you are checked at customs, you should be called and opened the parcel with you.  Now I have one inoperative device in my hands and I cannot say exactly what the cause of the problems is.  They sent it to the non-working or the citizens, the customs officers spoiled it so, most likely, it will remain unknown.  I will try to solve the problem with the Chinese, maybe the problem is not hardware or they can be returned under warranty.  In general, I will write more about this, but this is a completely different story. <br><br>  At the moment, the cost of one device for me is not $ 277, but $ 1,388 / 4 = <strong>347</strong> .  The amount for me is still acceptable, but relatively high. <br><br>  But there are nice moments.  <strong>Devices are great</strong> !  Just so <strong>cool</strong> !  In appearance, well ... I thought it would be much worse. <br><br> <a href=""><img title="Netbook NPX-9000" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fbd/081/6cc/fbd0816ccc519b725797e24e1636181d.jpg" width="484" height="410"></a> <br><br>  Test drive already spend, lay out the results a little later. <br><br>  <strong>Conclusions</strong> : <br><ul><li>  It's hard to work with the Chinese.  Highly.  If there is no person in China or if there is no possibility to go shopping for the goods, then it is better to think 5 times before deciding to buy.  If, nevertheless, they decided to buy something from the Chinese, then it is better to think another 5 times, and so on until this desire disappears (or not get tired of thinking). </li><li>  The supply contract must be required.  The contract must specify the allowable percentage of marriage, delivery time and conditions for refund. </li><li>  If there are any problems or misunderstandings, then it is better to find out them BEFORE sending the goods, and it is better BEFORE payment.  Then to solve something is almost impossible. </li><li>  If the lot is large, then, nevertheless, it is better to go and control the delivery yourself (or through the auditors to resolve this issue). </li><li>  If you buy something, it is better to indicate in the details of the recipient a private person, and not a company (no names of sites or anything superfluous).  Otherwise, the process of customs clearance can be very complicated. </li><li>  It is better to organize sending by the state mail, but not by means of the courier companies.  Had conversations with representatives of DHL, UPS and FedEx, in all these companies to receive the goods you need to pay a customs fee.  EMS has no such problems. </li><li>  If it turned out that it is necessary to undergo customs control, then it is better to do it yourself, without resorting to the services of customs brokers.  It is expensive, but if you wish, you can do everything yourself, the main thing is not to pull with it. </li><li>  Before passing through the controlling authorities, it is necessary, nevertheless, to translate the accompanying documents.  It is possible that the translation can be done independently, and in the translation bureau simply put a seal "for cookies". </li><li>  The opening of the parcel / parcel / container must <strong>ALWAYS be</strong> held <strong>IN YOUR PRESENCE</strong> .  Otherwise, you will not be able to prove that the goods came to you in good condition. </li><li>  When dealing with customs officials, it is highly desirable to have documents confirming the declared value of the goods, otherwise you will have to pay a customs fee based on the average price for this type of goods. </li></ul><br>  Well, actually everything.  From myself I would like to say that working honestly in our country is almost impossible.  The only option at the moment to shop on the Internet is if the delivery will be made using EMS.  Otherwise, without ties in customs control, the final purchase price may increase dramatically. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/44190/">https://habr.com/ru/post/44190/</a></p>
