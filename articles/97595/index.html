      I think that all the same "egg" is more paramount: to show something, it is necessary to REMOVE something to begin with! <br>  But ... I give to start the story: <br><br><h4>  Firstborn Circular Filming </h4><br><br>  I‚Äôll skip about photo cameras for shooting panoramas - articles on this topic in bulk! <br>  And we start with ... <br><br><h5>  1900, France, Grimuen-Samson, Sineorama </h5><br>  This miracle was demonstrated at the Paris World Exhibition.  The first camera for the first circular cinema was filmed on the BW film by 10 movie cameras. <br>  Fool was that one: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/373/987/ef7/373987ef7e7b03e7708ceeca7bf6dc8f.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The camera in the picture on the left - three men twist together the handle of a mechanical movie camera ... <br><br>  About Sineoram it is known that she worked for as many as three sessions - as a result, one of the filmmakers received a heat stroke at the workplace from overheating of the equipment and the cinema covered <br><br>  The hall was 100 meters in diameter and located under the Eiffel Tower.  The design of the hall was a "balloon gondola", under which the control room was located. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f5c/13e/063/f5c13e063b0b8f797127eca9b025034b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  1955  USA, Disney, Circaram </h5><br>  Disney used 11 Kodak cameras and a 16 mm color film. <br>  Unfortunately the photos of that first camera have not been preserved. <br>  Of the minuses - 16 mm film gave not the best picture ... <br><br>  In the cinema, screens were used with a standard aspect ratio and gaps between the screens through which the show was made: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e6e/b37/491/e6eb374915ccf8231a9e52e65729a88e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  1959  USSR, Goldovsky, "Circular Film Panorama" </h5><br>  Made in pitch Disney, who boasted Khrushchev his creation. <br>  To catch up and overtake - in three months a building was built with 22 screens and 22 projectors. <br>  The screens had a standard ratio, but were placed in two rows one above the other. <br><br>  Further information is not entirely accurate, because  according to one information - during the screening all 22 screens were used simultaneously, but on the other hand - according to the memoirs of Vasily Katayan, one of the directors of the first national film, they were filmed with 11 cameras and 11 films !!! <br>  According to scraps of information, the show was shown on 11 screens, and 11 additional ones were used for animated inserts, captions, etc. <br><br>  This is how the domestic ‚Äúbandura‚Äù looked like - 11 pieces of 35mm Konas cameras: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a15/68a/5f1/a1568a5f118d91948cd7f9ff06102cf3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  11 cameras and screens were a compliment to Disney: if you wanted, you could exchange films between countries, but ... <br>  Disney was offended and entered the Cold War ... <br><br>  Disney's answer was ‚Äúfurious and merciless‚Äù: in 1960 they went to work with 9 cameras and screens, which put an end to the exchange of films ... <br>  Our shrugged shoulders and showed ‚ÄúKuzkinu mother‚Äù: <br><br><h5>  1965  USSR, Goldovsky and Timofeev, ‚ÄúCircular Film Panorama‚Äù v2 </h5><br>  Our scientists thought, thought, after which they threw out half of the projectors, the screens were made solid in height and used anamorphic attachments for cameras and projectors. <br>  Actually, this is what everyone can see at the All-Russian Exhibition Center now: shooting and demonstration, as before, is going on a 35 mm film with a standard frame ratio, but ... <br>  ... When shooting, an anamorphic lens is put on each camera, which puts a twice higher picture on a standard frame! <br>  When showing - the projector does the same, ‚Äúpushing‚Äù the picture back. <br><br>  This has saved the film twice and a stunner: the picture has ceased to be "clamped" in height! <br>  For comparison, the film is shown on Disney and our systems: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/388/929/e2f/388929e2f7aead476c489d33a2e8057a.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ef3/c91/48c/ef3c9148c02d4efc6bfe6179cfe3388d.jpg" alt="image"><br>  "Feel the difference!" <br><br><h5>  Disney cameras </h5><br>  The cameras used and used by Disney‚Äôs studio are now more or less known: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bcf/34e/03e/bcf34e03ed1345610eba13cf1054ff39.gif" alt="image"><br>  Film cameras (now - they use digital), which look at the world through mirrors or prisms (in different models). <br>  What does this give? <br><br>  In the theory of panoramic photography there is such a term as ‚Äúparallax error‚Äù, which arises if the camera is rotated not around the camera‚Äôs ‚Äúoptical axis‚Äù when shooting frames for a panorama ... <br>  With our method of shooting - due to the brutal diameter of the camera, the error is palpable. <br>  In Disney - due to the fact that the cameras are ‚Äúturned‚Äù at 90 degrees - they are displaced much closer to the optical center, as a result, there is almost no error ... <br><br>  Actually on this you can complete a history tour, because  up to our time, the war was ‚Äúpositional‚Äù and little changed: <br>  The Disney system turned out to be more widespread due to the economy of the film, ours had more films due to state support ... <br>  There were almost no other players in this market ... <br><br><h4>  Our days </h4><br>  What has changed now? <br>  First of all - the availability of digital solutions! <br>  Now, every fool can afford to buy a video camera, a projector, a computer, and everything ‚Äî whatsoever ‚Äî you wish! <br><br>  Previously, the ‚Äúdivided‚Äù market of circular cinema was ignored for some time by everyone, and then it ‚Äúburst through‚Äù. <br><br>  Who is to blame first is no longer understandable, but a bunch of new players have suddenly appeared! <br><br><h5>  Cameras </h5><br>  Solutions are both homemade and "professional."  The number of cameras varies from 4 to 8, some manage to be implemented on 2 or one in general ... <br><br>  Examples: <br><h6>  Flyabout </h6><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a9f/278/2c7/a9f2782c705741e87f3c1529a5367248.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Research Camera. <br><br><h6>  Ladybug 2 </h6><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fa5/e03/807/fa5e03807d1b5b8ca7c413928b16862d.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Industrial, marketed sample.  He writes on a FireWire-connected laptop or computer, has 5 cameras around the perimeter and 1 on top.  All cameras are with a fish eye. <br><br><h6>  Immersive media </h6><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/524/18f/920/52418f92083d515bac9d55b1629bd61a.jpg" alt="image"><br>  11 cameras placed on the "ball". <br><br><h6>  All kinds of mirror attachments on the lens </h6><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2cc/9c7/3c7/2cc9c73c7223ca09b7edc80bba6d5ad7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The most "brilliant" solution - was the camera <br><h6>  Sony Bloggie with a panoramic lens </h6><br><img src="http://sp.sony-europe.com/media/166/82682" alt="image"><img src="http://www.sony.ru/res/images/image/48/1237477692648.jpg" alt="image"><br>  I mentioned about it in the last article: the ‚Äúonly‚Äù FullHD camera resolution became a blockage for this model - it turned out to be more than enough for shooting with such a lens ... <br>  <a href="http://www.sony.ru/hub/snap-mobile-hd/2/2">Demo features</a> <br><br>  For comparison - a <a href="http://www.vrhotwires.com/rtwspheres/melbourne2/index.html">video taken from a helicopter on Ledybug 2</a> <br>  And <a href="http://www.3dvor.ru/view_post2.php%3Fid%3D948">video from Haiti after the earthquake on Sonya</a> <br><br>  IMHO - Sonya does not pull! <br>  That's why I decided to use the multi-camera version ... <br><br><h5>  Cinemas </h5><br><h6>  360 movie </h6><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b47/917/388/b47917388bccc4b67be711e1895d7337.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Perhaps the only circular cinema that <a href="http://www.360move.tv/ru/excenter.html">they are trying to sell</a> !  Moreover, the site is even in Russian, including English and German! <br><br><h6>  igloo </h6><br>  <a href="http://www.igloovision.com/">Also an industrial design</a> , but these do not sell, but are rented. <br><br><h6>  Video installation with Q3 on a circular screen </h6><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cqh_F4iN8pg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjAUHOZp8nsoWdjeMvXzZyfjSj0kQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Plus a few more similar systems that have one common detail: <br>  They use 6 pieces of projectors with smooth docking transitions. <br><br>  Distinctive is <br><h6>  Google holodeck </h6><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ar5b3HUj_Sw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjvVzaWlCOxiE3kS2MYo8OpigqViw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  It uses 8 pieces of 57 inch flat-panel displays and projected a picture from Google Earth and Google Street. <br><br><h5>  Software players </h5><br>  What to do if you really want to see, but there is no money to buy such equipment, there is no place to put it, and breaks down to the nearest cinema? <br><br>  Naturally look on your computer! <br><br><h6>  Riubin`s Flash Panorama </h6><br>  IMHO - the most advanced of these players.  You can adjust a bunch of parameters, twist on a ball, cylinder, etc., play videos of almost any format and perversion - at least a ‚Äúribbon‚Äù, even Sonevskaya‚Äôs ‚Äúplanetary‚Äù recording. <br>  <a href="http://www.ryubin.com/panolab/panoflash/demo.html">Demos</a> can look at their site. <br><br><h6>  DVD </h6><br>  This, of course, is ridiculous, but ... <br>  DVD format supports so-called.  ‚ÄúMulti-angle shooting‚Äù, when a film or a piece of it can be viewed from different points of view: in particular, the ‚Äúdirectorial‚Äù versions of the film with explanatory drawings, etc. are based on this <br>  Just while watching you see ‚Äúshooting from the audience‚Äù from a certain angle, but you can ‚Äúturn your head‚Äù by switching to another ‚Äúcamera‚Äù ... <br><br><h4>  P.S </h4><br>  I missed and did not post some other materials that are not so curious or not very innovative ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/97595/">https://habr.com/ru/post/97595/</a></p>
