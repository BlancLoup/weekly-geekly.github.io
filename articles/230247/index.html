However, this time we will look at it from another side.  If your job involves conversion optimization, you already know how important usability testing is.  After all, if site visitors are not comfortable using its interface, the chances that they are converted into buyers are small.  Today, marketers can use the services of an ever-growing society of remote usability testers.  This translated article describes six, in the opinion of the author of the original publication, the most interesting sites for this purpose. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Usability testing is extremely important both for new services or services, and for understanding why already established mechanisms do not work the way we want.  You can test a site or service by friends, relatives, colleagues.  However, this is not always the time, and the element of bias is present.  After all, they often already know what you are doing and why, and therefore they are prepared.  But you can turn to specialized services where you can sort, record, select performers by category, hire moderators in the right quantity. <br><br>  Fortunately, now the number of Western services that can solve your problem is quite a lot.  We present to your attention 6 services with all their advantages: price, no need to hire staff, complete the task in a few hours.

      <b>TryMyUI</b> <br><br>  The <a href="http://www.trymyui.com/">TryMyUI</a> site offers services of specially trained testers who are able to set out the task execution protocol in as much detail as possible.  You just have to create a script.  Just specify the number of testers involved, determine the demographic profile - and within a few hours you will receive detailed video reports.  Each video shows the user's screen, mouse movements and input.  In addition, the customer is provided with an audio track on which everything that the tester says when trying to complete a task is clearly audible.  You can also create a questionnaire for each executor, which will be completed upon completion of testing. <br><br>  TryMyUI pays a lot of attention to quality assurance.  Despite democratic prices (from $ 35 for the job), each report is checked for utility.  All performers are sorted and cataloged - the customer can easily adjust filters by gender, age, annual earnings, computer skills, citizenship, education, marital status, and many other parameters.  For even more specialization of performers, the function of adding your own criteria is provided, for example, the attitude to games. <br><br>  If you do not want to pay for the tester, and want to hire them yourself, then you can buy a license with an unlimited number of artists for $ 99. <br><br>  <b>UsabilityHub</b> <br><br>  If you really love the testing / development process, then you most likely have already heard about <a href="https://usabilityhub.com/">UsabilityHub</a> .  This is a community of designers, webmasters and testers who test each other's work to earn karma points.  You can also invite your friends to join the working group. <br><br>  On this site you can run three different types of testing: <br>  ‚Ä¢ five-second test <br>  ‚Ä¢ click test <br>  ‚Ä¢ nav flow test <br><br>  You can get as many results as you want.  Statistics show that an average of about 50 responses in 20-30 hours. <br>  Free mode allows you to get several reports for yourself in exchange for tests for others, and paid plans start at $ 20 per 100 responses. <br><br>  <b>Crowdsourced testing</b> <br><br>  In the field of testing, this company is a newcomer who has just gone from a successful startup to an adult office.  <a href="https://crowdsourcedtesting.com/">Crowdsourced Testing</a> focuses on the professionalism of its employees, stating that most of them experience testing passes over six years.  In addition, the testers of this company are scattered across 111 countries of the world, which makes Crowdsourced Testing a good partner for marketers with global businesses. <br><br>  Only $ 49 per artist / platform Crowdsourced Testing allows you to test: <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Functional</b> - errors in the texts, bugs, dead links; <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Localization</b> - language and cultural adaptation of content for the selected region; <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Usability</b> - ease of use, overall system availability. <br><br>  It should be noted that, unlike the other options listed here, the demographic filter for selecting a team in Crowdsourced Testing is not flexible enough. <br>  Upon completion of registration, you need to enter basic data about your website or application, and then your project is sent to a working group that includes testers, experts, project manager and team lead.  This team starts working immediately, creating reports in a convenient and simple tracking program.  Upon completion of testing, you receive a complete list of recommendations that you can edit, discuss, or send to the development department or the customer. <br><br>  <b>Userlytics</b> <br><br>  <a href="https://crowdsourcedtesting.com/">Userlytics</a> offers a choice between the test team selected by them and the use of their own group of testers, which can send invitation links.  The company promises fast results, although upon completion of the work, you still need to ask testers up to 100 questions in the survey. <br><br>  The main feature of this crowdsourcing company is direct video communication with the tester throughout the work.  The ability to monitor the tester's face allows the customer to track subtle signals (for example, a raised eyebrow or confusion), which can help to figure out where the user is difficult to figure out and where he is lost. <br><br>  Prices start at $ 49 per respondent.  Quite expensive, but big companies will appreciate the functionality that allows you to receive a detailed report. <br><br>  <b>UserTesting</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.usertesting.com/">UserTesting</a> leads the way in remote crowdsourcing testing with a portfolio of several recognizable corporate clients.  It is alleged that the company employs more than one million artists, you will not believe, but their pool of testers is really so large.  UserTesting claims that thanks to this resource, 79% of clients get the required results within an hour of starting work.  You can apply demographic filters to candidates or use your clients as testers. <br><br>  Since UserTesting works with serious clients, its package of services goes beyond the framework of trivial testing.  Additional services include a wide range of corporate solutions, including personal interviews, focus groups, and detailed reports. <br><br>  The price of one test is $ 49, you can also order three tests for $ 99. <br><br>  <b>UserZoom</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.userzoom.com/">UserZoom</a> crowdsourcing testing is only a small part of the service.  The company does not hire its own testers, but the client can contact partner companies and get a filtered list of candidates for testing (for a fee).  If you are looking for candidates in your own database, UserZoom provides several easy-to-configure tools for communication and team building. <br><br>  UserZoom is more than a testing company.  Among the company's services, you will find polls, card-sourcing, tree-testing (for assessing accessibility, marking and organizing the structure of your site), testing prototypes and concepts, as well as many other services that will help you build a truly attractive and user-friendly site. <br><br>  Source: <a href="http://sitetuners.com/blog/6-tools-for-cost-effective-website-usability-testing">http://sitetuners.com/blog/6-tools-for-cost-effective-website-usability-testing</a> <br><br>  The editor is Igor Sergeev, a webmaster at <a href="http://witget.com/ru%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3Dusability">Witget.com</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/230247/">https://habr.com/ru/post/230247/</a></p>
