I opened <a href="http://parasite-eliminator.ru/">Parasite Eliminator</a> for everyone - a service and plugin for Wordpress, thanks to which there is no manual spam in my blogs. <br><br>  <b>November 10, 2008 is a rainy day for Russian blog spammers</b> (foreigners will have another rainy day, I don‚Äôt know when I‚Äôll make the international version of the plugin). <br><br><h2>  How does it work </h2><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Very similar to antivirus + firewall.  There are black and white lists that can be updated from the servers (in case of DDoS there is a backup server).  Lists are stored locally, you can add URLs to them or exclude them.  You can even raise your server if you know the format of the updates.

    <h5>  By the way, now in the black list for more than 1000 domains. </h5><br>  New comments "are scanned on the fly."  If there is a link from the blacklist, then the comment will be sent to the moderator or straight to spam.  I‚Äôll especially note that my plugin does not delete anything by itself.  Only marks. <br><br>  If the spammer URL is unknown to us, it will not be shown to search engines anyway.  Reached those links that are in the white list.  For example, if a blogger trusts a couple of dozen of his familiar bloggers, then the addresses of their blogs are included in the white list.  And only these URLs will be shown.  Others will be hidden for the time being. <br><br>  There is a scanner of the entire database.  Let's say someone managed to slip through until the database had its URL.  This is not a reason to leave trash on the blog, even if the links were not shown.  You can run a scan manually or on a schedule.  All comments in the database will be checked.  Check, by the way, is carried out very quickly. <br><br>  And the replenishment of the base will now be carried out even faster.  Members of the beta testers community are already sending me spamming URLs from their blogs.  An anti-spamming web is formed: a spammer has spoiled one of the network‚Äôs blogs ‚Äî his spamming comments disappeared from everywhere. <br><br><h5>  The situation‚Äôs piquancy is added by the fact that all spamming URLs, splogs and entire doorway grids I opened will be transferred to Yandex, Google and other search engines.  If the representatives of the search engines want to get the spamming nets opening algorithms, I will be happy to consider the offers. </h5><br><br>  While I only passed such a grid once, 30 doorways in the RU zone flew out for one update.  I will hand over the rest one of these days, all at once, so that the effect can be felt. <br><br><h2>  In the world of harvesting </h2><br>  There are two more mechanisms for daring spammers: training and scaring.  For the training of goblins there is an excellent feature.  You can test it like this: <a href="http://blog.parasite-eliminator.ru/news/privet-mir/">go to this post</a> and try to leave a comment there with a link to <a href="http://www.test.spam/">www.test.spam</a> ;-) <br><br>  The universal patented <a href="http://parasite-eliminator.ru/bloggers/magic/">graphic blogging replicator</a> is also an interesting artifact charged with special magic.  He will gain his strength over time.  The more bloggers show such badges to spammers, the more spammers will know about them and bypass the blog side.  If you wake up in a secure blog, you can go to the blacklist and lose hundreds of comments already left. <br><br><h2>  The world's first anti-spam service for spammers </h2><br>  <a href="http://parasite-eliminator.ru/spammers/">For poor blogosamers,</a> too, there is a knockout.  The red list of dangerous blogs, which can be downloaded, and pushed into their programs, so as not to run into a blog, from which the direct path to the black list and to the table to the moderators of search engines. <br><br><h2>  How it all began </h2><br>  At one time, when I opened <a href="http://blog.micromarketing.ru/">Micromarketing</a> or <a href="http://blog.studiomade.ru/">the Made Studio blog</a> , I immediately installed <a href="http://www.gudlyf.com/2004/06/07/wordpress-hack-authimage/">AuthImage</a> and <a href="http://www.theblog.ca/math-anti-spam/">Math Anti-Spam,</a> respectively.  Automatic spam did not pass, but the spammers mowed under normal people and wrote, ‚Äúit is inhumanly difficult‚Äù to enter a word of 4 letters. <br><br>  But there were subhumans who were engaged in manual spam blogs.  I already wrote about customers for such spam in due time.  With the stubbornness of a true moron, they tried to postpone their larvae in one blog, now in another, then at my clients. <br><br>  It was necessary to have some kind of tool that would allow centrally clean all my blogs from manual spam at once.  Then I decided, why not keep a base of these monsters?  A spam comment comes, I add the URL to the database, and all my blogs become immune to this one. <br><br>  The number of spam domains is limited, the task is solved by even one person.  At first, I wanted to use regular Wordpress tools (there you can enter domains on the stop list), but when I saw the engine code, I realized that it simply would not work.  Do not sduzhit.  Check, say, a thousand comments on several thousand domains during the script will be simply unrealistic. <br><br>  After reading about PHP and MySQL, and after consulting with <a href="http://lessio.ru/">Alexey</a> and <a href="http://mzz.ru/">Ivan</a> , I proceeded to design, invented and implemented an algorithm for unwinding splog networks that Google would envy Google with. <br><br>  After some time, the first version for closed beta testing was ready. <br><br>  The first versions of the plugin worked very quickly, but sometimes buggy.  Eternal memory to the comments in the blog of Anton Popov, one of the first beta testers and the glory of backups, from which comments were restored. <br><br>  I eliminated serious bugs promptly, and the plugin worked on my blogs regularly.  Due to lack of time, I misused him a little, but over the course of this weekend, with effort of will, the plug-in itself and the plug-in site finally ‚Äúgave in‚Äù.  Come, download, test. <br><br>  The <a href="http://www.theblog.ca/math-anti-spam/">Math Anti-Spam</a> and <a href="http://parasite-eliminator.ru/">Parasite Eliminator</a> bundle works great. <br><br><h2>  How you can help the right cause of dealing with manual spam in the comments: </h2><br><ul><li>  Test on different versions of Wordpress, in different conditions.  Now working confirmed in different assemblies, from 2.0.4 to 2.6.3 </li><li>  Catch bugs and vulnerabilities in Parasite Eliminator, if there are such ones left. </li><li>  To catch non-optimal places in the code. </li><li>  Tell familiar bloggers to use. </li><li>  Tell familiar spammers to be afraid. </li><li>  Make a review of the plugin in my blog. </li><li>  Send me samples of spam with URLs that are not in the database. </li><li>  Make a similar plugin for other blog engines. </li><li>  Take part in the program " <a href="http://parasite-eliminator.ru/bloggers/redlist/">Red List</a> ". </li></ul><br><br><h2>  Update: spammers are moving! </h2><br>  Already trying to mess. <br><br>  And in the statistics appeared visits from closed spam forums. <br><br><h2>  Update2: the main server does not even ping </h2><br>  Well, yes, in this case, I provided a <a href="http://parasite-eliminator.narod.ru/">spare airfield</a> . <br><br>  During this period, all installed plug-ins automatically switch to updates from this backup server. <br><br>  And, of course, you can <a href="http://parasite-eliminator.narod.ru/">go in and download the plug-in</a> from ‚ÄúPeople‚Äù now. <br><br>  It turned out that this is not DDoS, but in the data center they are changing a large and important piece of hardware.  No other time found. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/44240/">https://habr.com/ru/post/44240/</a></p>
