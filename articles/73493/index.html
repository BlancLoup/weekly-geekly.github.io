      I will try to tell everything coherently and in turn.  Only four introductory points. <br><br>  <b><i>The first.</i></b>  I am worrying a lot.  The project is more amateurish than most of Habr's advanced audience can imagine, but I take a risk because I want to get advice and feedback from professionals and experts. <br><br>  <b><i>The second.</i></b>  I managed to find an amazing blog ‚ÄúElektrokhabr‚Äù - I think this place where I just have to write about our site is closely related to electronics. <br><br>  <b><i>Third.</i></b>  The site is available in the Ukrainian language with rare patches of English - it happened historically, but the specialized content of the site all the same does not require translation - details under the text. <br><br>  <b><i>Fourth.</i></b>  Dear, an unknown reader - a designer or web developer, programmer or just an expert in their field!  Please understand and meet me!  The site was made by non-professionals, the author never studied web design or programming, this is an amateur project for which the word ‚Äúvalidity‚Äù of death is similar, errors can be listed for hours, and the CMS of which we use is notorious and disrespectful ... <br><br>  If you are not ready to forgive amateurs for their short-sightedness, non-professionalism and lack of money to develop a decent website, and you are not interested in why 18 thousand electronics engineers still registered on our site - do not unleash your anger on me, I ask you.  I am ready to accept the advice willingly.  Thank you very much. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  One day at the end of 2006, I decided to create a website <b><a href="http://tv-remont.info/">tv-remont.info</a></b> for my relative, who, in addition to his main job, is engaged in a secondary, private enterprise, a television show of imported equipment. <br><br>  This business has been operating since 1996, and over the ten years of operation, 5 and then 6 gigabytes of electronic circuits have accumulated imperceptibly and gradually, not all in a row, but only the most necessary, rare, sought-after and interesting ones. <br><br>  A suitable repository was found for the catalog of these schemes, and then a site directory was created in which it was possible to find and download the scheme you need. <br><br>  For three years, if the site has changed, it is not too dramatic.  Basically, the catalog was filled with new, necessary and useful schemes.  English-language tips have been added for users from other countries, which turned out to be surprisingly many. <br><br>  Judging by the statistics, we were visited by residents of almost all countries of the world.  Apparently TVs break everywhere :) <br><br>  Those interested could order a DVD with all the schemes of the site, but this has never been a real ‚Äúonline store‚Äù, because all the schemes are available for download for free. <br><br>  Now the site is going through hard times.  Attendance and indexability have fallen, the indicators of "steepness" - TCI, PR - are close to zero.  :( <br><br>  Nevertheless, I ventured to submit our project to the community, and will address such questions: <br><br><ul><li>  Do you think our project is popular if we managed to attract so many users, or is it just an accident and worthless facts? </li><li>  What actions to develop the site we should take and - is it worth? </li><li>  Maybe our project is ‚Äúlast year‚Äôs snow‚Äù and we should not try to develop? </li></ul><br><br>  The opinion of the community is important for me and it is difficult for me to make a decision independently.  I will be grateful for feedback and feedback, as well as advice. <br><br>  <b>PS:</b> And of course, all electronic engineers and telemasters - those who did not know about us - I invite you to evaluate the usefulness and relevance of the site. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/73493/">https://habr.com/ru/post/73493/</a></p>
