This is NOT a hack for iPhones purchased with firmware 1.1.2 and 1.1.3.

Everything is quite simple - first the firmware 1.1.3 itself downloads (via aytyuns), then the script starts from the downloaded file, the script downloads something from the Internet and patches the firmware 1.1.3.  Then the body reboots - voila!  - you already have 1.1.3, enjoy. <br>  <strong>UPDATE.</strong>  <strong>As it turned out in the comments, this method is already slightly outdated.</strong>  <strong>Today there is a new one, everything is updated using the Installer.</strong>  <strong>Step by step instructions - <a href="http://www.iclarified.com/entry/index.php%3Fenid%3D611">here</a> (easier) or <a href="http://www.hackthatphone.com/113/iphone_113_jailbreak_mac_easy.html">here</a> .</strong>  <strong>This method is better because some bugs are fixed.</strong>  . <br><br>  <strong>What about unlock?</strong> <br><br>  This is a tricky update, it simply replaces the firmware files.  Those who have phones cracked by enisyme and other soft things, can not worry, the unlock will remain, their SIM cards will continue to work.  It is also clear with multisim and turbosim - everything will work as well. <br><br>  <strong>Minuses</strong> <br><br>  1. For 1.1.3 while there is no "Russian project".  The developers have reported that there is a beta version, it is being tested now, everything should be soon, but for now we are writing transliteration, because  Russian keyboard does not work :). <br><br>  2. One of the new features 1.1.3 does not work - positioning (by base stations of the network and wifi-points) in google maps.  Apparently, due to the fact that there is interaction with the network, and our phones are hacked.  Well, I think someone will write a patch.  By the way, for iphone there is a prog Locate me, also determines the position of the operator‚Äôs stations.  At 1.1.1 and 1.1.2 worked fine, but at 1.1.3 crashes.  <em>(As it turned out, the problem is in the update method, use the second one, it is written about it above).</em> <br><br>  3. I haven't noticed any particularly serious bugs.  A couple of times flew to the menu, but this is normal for him :).  The only problem is that my friend does not want to tune the mail - he says that there is no password - although we enter it (somehow, it is erased when saving or checking it).  Everything went smoothly for me, but when other accounts were added to the test (any), I also erased the password, so somehow I was lucky.  <em>(This problem also does not appear if you update by the second method).</em> <br><br>  4. I put a little more, but not everything works from third-party software.  I wanted to add a post with my own screenshots, not a single skin shooter wanted to work :(. But there is no quality photo, so I will not torment you :). <br>  <em>!</em>  <em>Perhaps the problems with the software were also due to my use of the first method of jailbreaking, but in the comments <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/iphone/34849.html">they say</a> that there are glitches with the software in the second way.</em> <br><br>  <strong>pros</strong> <br><br>  1. Previously, Safari took off almost constantly.  And over the past few days at 1.1.3 - for once. <br><br>  2. Of course, a killer feature with the movement of desktop icons.  How made is beautiful and comfortable!  To start moving the icons to your liking - click on one of them and hold your finger - soon all the icons will begin to tremble and you can drag them back and forth.  When dragging, you see how neighboring icons move.  To drag to the second desktop - just drag the icon to the edge of the screen.  To fix the new location of the icons - click on a single button.  I arranged all the icons to my liking, plus I dragged all the unused ones onto the second desktop (this is possible, even if the first one is not completely filled), now they don‚Äôt interfere. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/d24/be6/da8/d24be6da8c1af4883517afddc7daf11b.jpg" width="450" height="296" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/07b/391/583/07b391583f122c8222376d028cb5c182.jpg" width="450" height="300" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  3. An excellent feature with a desktop shortcut for a web page.  Moreover, the icon is the part of the site that is open.  You can, for example, open and enlarge the logo - it will be very beautiful.  And for web applications (beejive messenger, hahlo twitter, etc.) their own colorful icons are set at all. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/805/bea/862/805bea862572da5043eb170bd00fa28c.jpg" width="450" height="297" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/c4c/4ee/d5d/c4c4eed5da88b67f4e7130c3be3b4c76.jpg" width="450" height="299" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  4. At the McWorld, Jobs stated that now you can see the lyrics of the song while listening to it (if the text is written in the file, of course).  At first I thought it was a useless thing.  But I was pleasantly surprised when I decided to listen to the latest Radio-T podcast and saw the shounts on the screen! <br><br>  5. Google maps.  As mentioned above, autodetection does not work, well, God bless him.  But there was a hybrid view when the street map is superimposed on the map from the satellite.  Convenient for sufferers of topographical cretinism like me. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/765/1a4/857/7651a4857188638a6709e4c0b1e3fd23.jpg" width="450" height="299" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/ca0/31b/79d/ca031b79d877e990a0e6ddcb9475389f.jpg" width="450" height="293" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  <em>This is how the location is determined on the original firmware 1.1.3</em> <br><br>  6. Another feature appeared to send SMS to several recipients at once, but I don‚Äôt remember when I last used it even on other phones. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/237/d28/9ca/237d289ca0b1fe99ea524a566f608f69.jpg" width="450" height="148" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  <strong>Recommendations</strong> <br><br>  Upgrade or not?  You decide.  If you need the Russian language in the phone and stable software work - better tolerate it.  And if for you the iPhone seems to be a toy and you are being pulled to experiment - update yourself, get acquainted with new functions, and then maybe the ‚ÄúRussian project‚Äù will finish everything :). <br><br>  That seems to be all.  If you have questions, additions, write, ask. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/19468/">https://habr.com/ru/post/19468/</a></p>
