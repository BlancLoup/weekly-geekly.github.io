  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Profession programmer. Calling or going nowhere?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, I was thinking about the future of various professions in the IT industry, and I had more and more unclear moments for the specialty programmer.  Not that generally accepted among accountants and secretaries, the idea that this is a student who will fix the printer and eliminate glitches with the program - I think for them, everyone who knows how to competently work on a computer is sure to be programmers :) I mean really professional of his own business who chose this specialization to create and create.  I think many people, choosing their future profession, did it more or less consciously, and, I hope, had an idea about how their professional development will take place.  But enough philosophy, more to the point. <br>  All who wanted to become doctors, in the course of their life become good professional doctors.  Lawyers in the course of their practice gain experience and become respected lawyers who are in demand among their clients. <br>  What happens to the one who chose the path of the programmer? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Researching articles, forums, blogs, and one‚Äôs own experience in communicating with people one way or another connected with programming and creating software shows that to maintain professionalism a programmer must constantly be aware of many new technologies, know new techniques for solving various tasks to avoid inventing his own bicycle - in general, in every way to replenish their piggy bank of knowledge and skills.  As practice shows, in the first five to seven years this can be done fairly freely (we take an audience of young people aged 18‚Äì25 years).  Nevertheless, during this period there are already enough moments when the technology in which the programmer was a professional becomes unclaimed. <br>  Remember the past decade, when Fortran, Cobol, Lisp went nowhere (although someone might say that this is not the case, but the mass character is no longer observed);  Basic - as a serious development language;  Pascal / Delphi / C ++ Builder (forgive me ardent supporters) - many libraries and technologies have been supplanted.  From the point of view of the software manufacturer, the most up-to-date technology will always be in demand, therefore a professional should be aware of events.  But, for example, while the professional is working on a project using current knowledge and skills, the next generation is already gaining experience in new technologies and areas, offering itself to the market as a ready-made specialist, while the old one has to be retrained. <br>  In most cases, after a certain time, the professional programmer turns into a project manager, i.e.  in fact, in the manager, or trying to open his business, or goes into freelancing (in principle, this is his own business, but on a limited scale).  Although, you see, not every programmer can become a good leader.  What will happen in 10-20 years with those who simply know how to create programs and really loves it? <br><br>  It turns out a unique situation: in most cases the doctor remains a doctor, the writer is a writer, the lawyer is a lawyer.  The programmer has the same perspective - to become a manager or change the specialty.  Some may disagree, but do you know much in the life of 40-50 year old programmers working in their field? <br>  At the end I want to ask a question to everyone who has chosen the path of development for himself as a programmer.  Who do you see yourself in the future?  And if you want to become a leader, wouldn't it have been better to make more efforts to advance in this particular area? </div>
