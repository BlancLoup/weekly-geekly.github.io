Putting him on his head and wandering for 15 minutes in Duke Nukem 3D was worth some big money, probably like 10 hours of playing on a regular computer in a club. <br>  My friend put on a helmet, but after about thirty seconds he screamed and tore it off his head.  That day I did not dare (or did not have enough money) to try a novelty.  It's been 20 years.

      Google, Facebook, Samsung, Valve, HTC, Sony, Microsoft, NASA - everyone pays close attention to virtuality.  We are waiting for a tricky move from Apple. <br><br>  I immediately jumped in and made a selection of useful materials, I want to contact the developers who have already had experience in developing games / software for BP, share my impressions. <br><br>  For a couple of weeks, I dealt with all sorts of ‚Äúrealities‚Äù (Baudrillard rests with his hyper-reality), with a history of virtual reality helmets and with a philosophical base (greetings to Lem, Castaneda, Bartla and Datsyuk).  I dug up and shared what I‚Äôve dug out with hack readers.  And start a flash mob to translate Richard Bartle‚Äôs book Design of Virtual Worlds. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúLet it not be accessible to everyone, but the intellectual elite swore allegiance to the new empire.

The project was first presented at the 2014 Google I / O conference. <br>  The project is a virtual reality simulation using a helmet assembled according to a special scheme made of cardboard, optical lenses, magnet and velcro fasteners, as well as a smartphone inserted into it on an Android or iOS operating system with a pre-installed application. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6d1/787/38f/6d178738f05ddd37bcb4b144bde5339e.png" alt="image"><br>  at the developer conference Google I / O 2014, a virtual reality helmet Cardboard, made of cardboard and easy to manufacture, was introduced, many found it an amusing fad. <br><br>  Google Play now has a special section where applications are compatible with Cardboard.  With their help, you can virtually enjoy the concert of Paul McCartney, take part in races or play three-dimensional table tennis.  In addition, the project acquired a full-fledged developer toolkit (SDK) for Android and Unity, which should allow willing enthusiasts to create their own applications for Cardboard and improve the rendering and tracking functions of the head in them. <br><br>  Among other things, the new SDK allows you to create very serious virtual effects. <br>  In the world, about 500,000 Google Cardboard have been collected, and the system itself has been in demand in the field of education and advertising. <br><br>  Volvo saddled the trend and in the wake of the hype, they were excellently promoted by releasing branded cartons. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wuln2bJkp1k%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiyW4F7rkM5X3IhOHbLfic14OeFuw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">forks carton</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Knoxlabs <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ea7/3ae/f08/ea73aef0857e211784082ff3293bc47a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  DODOcase <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b51/b8e/11b/b51b8e11b7f4088542617aefb85b71c1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I am cardboard <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/384/d83/d70/384d83d70e09539e39b6e9d2875136e5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Powis <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7c4/1df/61f/7c41df61f6879fe5ed46b2e9cc34d979.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Goggle tech <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ca9/f1e/a0e/ca9f1ea0e338c41929a32ba0206986dd.jpg" alt="image"><br></div></div><br></div></div><br><br><h4>  What I tested in Moscow </h4><br>  You can not buy (still raw product) for 300 bucks, do not rub corn on the damp cardboard, and not spoil the grandfather's diving mask, there are options for helmets in the region of 2-4 thousand rubles. <br><br>  <a href="http://neuromatix.ru/tovary/garnitura-virtualnoy-realnosti-g-01.html">VR Shinecon</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c8a/b5c/3da/c8ab5c3daf5c472b951eca225ffcc838.jpg"><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">View from all sides</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bd0/54a/3cc/bd054a3cc1fa4baf604d144ffd4be3d7.gif" alt="image"><br></div></div><br><br>  Standing in Moscow / St. Petersburg - <a href="http://neuromatix.ru/tovary/garnitura-virtualnoy-realnosti-g-01.html">3900 rubles</a> .

Sits well, sturdy construction. <br><br><h5>  Thoughts about the design </h5><br>  Interestingly, all modern helmets are made according to the same scheme, it looks a bit one-sided and everyone has the same mistakes and shortcomings (for example, the fact that eyes get tired, or the fact that everything is piled up and pulls down and has great inertia).  In the old implementations, there are some solutions that, IMHO, can give a huge advantage to those who dare to introduce them to the mass market. <br><br>  It seems to me that the ‚Äúbulk‚Äù should not be placed before the eyes, it should either be carried out from the head, or even ‚Äúsmeared‚Äù evenly over it, so that it would be convenient to turn the head, otherwise it will be easy for gamers to know by the bull neck.  And to bring the "waveguides" to the eyes.

While the book was being written, these dedicated professionals checked all its materials in terms of terminology, organization of the material and the sequence of its location.  Their feedback was a decisive argument in favor of the fact that ‚ÄúCreating virtual worlds‚Äù satisfies the needs of our readers in technical information at the highest level. <br>  Matt Michali is one of the co-founders, lead developer, and director of Achaea LLC.  Achaea was founded in San Francisco in 1996 and develops and manufactures commercial text-based multiplayer games.  On their account are such successful and popular projects as ‚ÄúAchaea, Dreams of Divine Lands‚Äù, ‚ÄúAetolia, the Midnight Age‚Äù, and ‚ÄúImperian‚Äù, designed on the basis of the licensed network engine ‚ÄúAchaea‚Äù - Rapture.  Matt graduated from Cornell University in 1994 with a degree in political science and works as a licensed stockbroker.  This experience inspired him to create games, and he became an expert in the field of business models, political systems and social dynamics of virtual worlds. <br>  Along with games, he spends his free time in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, kickboxing, likes to cook, travel, go hiking, and also enjoys kayaking, skiing and snorkeling. <br>  Damion Schubert has been working in the field of professional creation of online worlds for more than 7 years.  Initially, he was the creator of "Meridian 59" (and several extensions of this game), as well as the lead developer of the now-disappeared "Ultima Online-2".  In addition, he managed to work in such projects as "The Sims Online", "Kalisto's Highlander Online". <br>  Damion is currently working as a senior developer at Wolfpack, which launched the Shadowbane project in March 2003. <br></div></div><br>  The purpose of this book is to make people think about the creation of virtual worlds.  And as long as you have your own thoughts on this topic, it does not matter whether you agree with at least something of what is stated in it. <br>  A significant part of the created virtual worlds are derived from already existing ones.  As a rule, developers choose from one or two existing systems, thinking little about the question of why ... <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Foreword</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  ... why these worlds were created in just one way or another, and this fact cannot but be disturbed.  However, it is not at all because such a device is devoid of any creative principle - no, the developers, for the most part, have enough imagination to create their own special worlds.  Because the resulting world does not work as well as it could. <br>  If the developer does not have an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat reasons were behind the adoption of a technical solution, how can he be sure that the conditions that gave rise to these decisions also apply to his case? <br>  Are game designers aware of the fact that there are solutions that can be reconsidered? <br>  Despite the fact that the development of a plan is a gradual process, this does not mean that the developers themselves cannot speed it up.  The virtual world means freedom, and not only its inhabitants, but also its creators.  In your own virtual world, characters are not at all obliged to subdivide into four main professional categories just because they are similarly classified in all other virtual worlds you know;  moreover, it does not even mean that you are obliged to classify them at all. <br>  Virtual worlds are not like anything.  You can not approach them from the standpoint of a specialist in any other field - the creation of games, literature, journalism, architecture, or some other.  It would be naive to believe that all the same rules apply to VMs.  Unfortunately, it does not seem so from the outside, and therefore people who come to a virtual design from some kind of sphere that is considered Damn Steep often ask the question: ‚ÄúHow difficult is it?‚Äù <br>  Later they get an answer to their question. <br>  If lucky, they get it fast.  Less fortunate ones get an answer, having already spent a year and a half of work and half of the budget.  Creating virtual worlds is extremely difficult, unless you understand what you are getting involved in;  then the whole process will seem no more difficult than any other creative activity. <br>  The key is the realization that something that seems absolutely logical from a normal point of view can be completely catastrophic if you look from the other side - and the understanding that the world in which you draw inspiration almost certainly contains some elements created by people. who had no idea about the named circumstance. <br>  Creating a virtual world is perhaps one of the greatest creative acts of the imagination.  Your possibilities are almost endless - in the virtual worlds, you can create anything and do as you please.  Anything you wish!  Today's virtual worlds are just childish pranks compared to masterpieces that will see the light in the future.  We see these fun, not having the slightest idea about what masterpieces are waiting for us;  The virtual worlds of the future will undoubtedly be different from the modern virtual worlds, but we don‚Äôt yet know what exactly.  Thus, much of what you read in this book is bound to prove erroneous over time.  However, she can also point the way to the search for truth.  All that she claims is only to give people the opportunity to reflect on what they are creating;  and if this book helps them in this, then it does its job well. <br>  I don't care what you think;  as long as you think. </div></div><br><br>  <b>Overview of the main chapters</b> <br><br>  The material outlined in the book is organized as follows. <br>  Each chapter begins with bringing concrete facts, gradually moving to conclusions.  At the same time, theories of the game and the development of virtual worlds are outlined, vividly demonstrating the viability of such a subject as the creation of virtual worlds as an object of study. <br><br>  <b>Chapter 1. Familiarity with virtual worlds.</b> <br>  What is a virtual world?  The chapter opens with a historical essay on how they began and how they came to what they are today.  The following describes the various classes of virtual worlds and what they mean for developers.  Also presented are the factors affecting the VM from other types of art, and explaining some of the trends that the creation of virtual worlds has taken. <br><br>  <b>Chapter 2. How to create virtual worlds.</b> <br>  This relatively short chapter outlines the development process that is generally applicable to virtual worlds and the impact this process has on what developers do.  In addition, it includes a study of how virtual worlds are usually applied and what limitations this imposes. <br><br>  <b>Chapter 3. Players.</b> <br>  This important chapter looks at people playing virtual worlds, because only by fully understanding the reasons why people play can the developer hope to satisfy the needs of the players.  It focuses on two such important concepts as ‚Äúimmersion‚Äù and ‚Äúpersonality‚Äù, and how they can be connected using an extended model of ‚Äúplayer types‚Äù.  The chapter is accompanied by a discussion on the topic of gaming communities in virtual worlds. <br><br>  <b>Chapter 4. Development of the world.</b> <br>  This chapter refers to the theory developed in the third chapter, and describes the practical solutions that a developer has to make in the process of creating virtual worlds.  Here are the various options that are possible at each stage of development, with an explanation of why the developer may or may not want to include them in the universe of his game. <br><br>  <b>Chapter 5. Life in the VM.</b> <br>  This chapter covers the characters themselves more than the players behind them.  Here, various ways are considered, how a character‚Äôs skills, experience and advancement through levels can be presented, along with various possibilities that allow characters to form their groups.  Also various systems are described, along with various endings to which they can lead.  The theory of 3 chapters is used here mainly as a supplement, but the question of why the players still play in the VM is fully disclosed and clarified. <br><br>  <b>Chapter 6. This is not a game, this is ...</b> <br>  A purely theoretical chapter that presents the development of a VM as an object of serious scientific research.  By studying the question that other spheres of knowledge find such interesting things for themselves in VM, it is possible to establish the boundaries of the subject of study and evaluate its significance.  Moreover, developers can pick up and directly apply in practice the discoveries made by experts from other fields of science in the field of VM. <br>  The purpose of this chapter is the conviction that: ‚ÄúVM is not just a game.  It is something completely different. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Chapter 7. On the critical aesthetics.</b> <br>  This chapter is another attempt at persuasion, although, in this case, it is intended to protect VM developers from critics ‚Äî fellow workers in the workshop ‚Äî rather than those who have nothing to do with VM creation.  The purpose of this chapter is to justify the following statement: ‚ÄúCreating a VM is an art form.‚Äù To this end, the chapter sets out the principles of critical aesthetics ‚Äî to discover the meaning of the work of designers, which would give them the opportunity to develop further. <br><br>  <b>Chapter 8. Epilogue: Reflections on Ethics.</b> <br>  This final chapter discusses the issue of ethics in the process of creating a VM.  Many questions are asked here, but very few answers are given;  the purpose of the chapter is rather to awaken in developers a sense of responsibility, rather than to teach them how to act. <br><br>  Chapter 1. Familiarity with virtual worlds. <br>  Main themes: <br><br><ul><li>  Some definitions. </li><li>  What is VM and how did it come about? </li><li>  The past determines the future. </li><li>  The basics. </li><li>  External influences on the VM. </li><li>  VM developer. </li></ul><br>  (Collapse) <br>  What is VM?  In this context, the world is a certain habitat that its inhabitants regard as autonomous.  And this does not necessarily have to be a whole planet - the ‚Äúworld‚Äù here is used in the same meaning as in the words ‚ÄúRoman world‚Äù or ‚Äúworld of finance‚Äù.  But what about the virtual component?  Without going into unnecessary philosophizing, I will say this: <br><br><ul><li>  VM - material. </li><li>  VM is not a figment of the imagination. </li><li>  VM is not virtual, although it is similar to it externally and creates an impression of it. </li><li>  VM is the place where the imaginary is confronted with the real </li></ul><br><br>  Some definitions. <br><br>  VMs exist because of the computer (or network of computers) that models the environment.  And some - but not all - entities in this environment operate under the direct control of individual people.  Due to the fact that several people simultaneously affect the environment, the world is called mass, or multi-user.  At the same time, the environment continues to exist and internal development (at least to some extent), even when no one interacts with it;  This means that the environment is stable. <br>  Despite the fact that nowadays VMs are much more widely used, being not only entertainment, their sources should be sought in computer games;  Moreover, it is possible, largely due to the huge amounts of money invested in the development of computer games and the unbelievable profits that are guaranteed to be paid monthly - computer games remain at the forefront of VM development. <br>  For these reasons, the vocabulary describing the VM, as a rule, gaming (game).  Thus, people interacting with the modeled environment are not called users, but ‚Äúgamers‚Äù (players);  the means by which the medium represents the players to their goal is called ‚Äúgameplay‚Äù;  and, accordingly, the activity connected with interaction with the given environment, is called ‚Äúgame‚Äù. <br>  Of course, specialists from other areas can use their own terminology when researching VMs.  For example, a cultural anthropologist would prefer to talk about ‚Äúindividuals‚Äù producing ‚Äúreactions‚Äù in response to ‚Äúexternal circumstances‚Äù.  However, it is impossible to deny the prevalence of game terminology in the case of a broader discussion of the subject;  and, thus, we will continue to use it. <br>  An exception is the very concept of "Virtual World".  Since that time, a number of words, phrases and abbreviations have been developed to describe this designed environment, none of which, however, can be called successful.  Initially, for some reasons, which will be briefly described below, the VMs were called MPM, i.e.  multiplayer worlds.  (Also in the course of reducing the MAD or MUD from the English version of the MUD). <br>  Despite the fact that this name is quite widespread, to such an extent that it is found even in some official dictionaries, however, it does not have universal acceptance.  In particular, some players of certain VM varieties prefer the term MP * (MU *) (MP is multi-user, and * is what can follow this definition), because  they believe that MPM (MUD) assumes the presence of a combat component. <br>  This is similar to the fact that dinosaurs would be called "* Zavry" on the grounds that the definition of "dinosaurs" suggests1 that they were all carnivorous monsters with a tiny brain, although in fact many of them were herbivorous monsters with a tiny brain - and there are also pterosaurs and plesiosaurs. <br><br>  1 "Dino" - came to medieval Latin from Greek, from the word "deinos", which means "inspiring fear."  "Saurus" means "lizard." <br><br>  The first virtual worlds were with a text interface, and their environment and events were described more with words than with graphics.  But the difficulty is that, although the term MMM is applied in relation to the VM in general, the term MP * does not apply to them, because it is used strictly in relation to the text interface.  The appearance of computer graphics in this confusion caused a second wave of renames to draw the line between graphic and textual MMM.  At first, the new worlds (using computer graphics) were called ‚Äúpersistent world‚Äù (the Constantly Living World - that is, the world that continues to exist in the absence of players).  But when their defining feature was a huge number of players playing at the same time, the name changed to MMORPG - a massively multiplayer online role-playing game.  Now this abbreviation is often used, but without much enthusiasm (not the last reason is the abbreviation difficult to pronounce) and, most likely, as soon as some more acceptable option appears, this abbreviation will be rejected. <br>  And, despite the fact that these computer-controlled, multi-user, ‚Äúconstantly living‚Äù worlds can and should be called MPM (MUD), however, this term is so overloaded that no one, except for a narrow circle of participants, perceives it in this way because the definition is completely confusing.  In addition, there are enough people who think that MPM (MUD) is just one of the types of MP * (MU *), rather than vice versa.  Therefore, in our book we will use the more visual and less expressive term ‚Äúvirtual world‚Äù. <br>  It is important to note that the ‚Äúvirtual world‚Äù and ‚Äúvirtual reality‚Äù are not the same thing, the term ‚Äúvirtual world‚Äù is much more specific.  Virtual reality deals mainly with the mechanisms that allow people to interact with computer simulators;  and she does not investigate the nature (essence) of simulators.  People visiting a VM will undoubtedly once benefit from the study of visors (helmet or virtual reality glasses), digital gloves, and so on, but its main charm lies for them in anticipation of what awaits them outside the doors of the virtual world, and not with using what they can get there. <br><br>  continued transfer <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/264469/">here</a> <br></div></div><br><br>  <b>Acknowledgment:</b> thanks to <a href="http://neuromatix.ru/vr/">Neuromatix</a> for the equipment provided. <br><br><h4>  PS </h4>  Our work in darkness - <br>  We do what we can <br>  We give what we have - <br>  Our work is in darkness. <br><br>  Doubts have become a passion <br>  And passion has become fate. <br>  Everything else is art <br>  In the madness of being yourself. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/264169/">https://habr.com/ru/post/264169/</a></p>
