Personal experience for 2019</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I have been using wireless charging for 1.5 years now.  And I think that this is the future.  Already today, wireless charging quietly appear in daily life.  And in a few years they will be able to become a strong and visible competitor to wired charging. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-2/pz/lk/-2pzlk-dx9otju9mr5n97ls4np0.jpeg"><br><br>  Here are the benefits of wireless charging: <a name="habracut"></a>

      1) Saving money.  Charging is cheaper than wire.  The cost of a new high-quality wire (or the purchase of a wire on an urgent basis) will be more than the cost of wireless charging. <br><br>  2) Save power.  It is more convenient for me to put the phone on charge, than to get the wire.  Yes, for this you need to put the phone in the center of wireless charging, so that it starts charging.  But it's easy to do, <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/446728/">here</a> I brought measurements of the wireless charging zone. <br><br>  3) Convenience.  If different phones are used at home, then usually everyone has different chargers.  Wireless charging QI - a single charging standard. <br><br>  This is the same logic if you have multiple gadgets.  Wireless headphones, watches are also charging for wireless charging.  And you can charge multiple devices on charges with multiple coils. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oj/d1/ow/ojd1owkusgtxaxaizfuhnxoeha4.jpeg"><br><br>  4) Simplify life.  Where do I need to put wireless charging and charge the phone?  Where the phone is <u>not used</u> . <br><br>  If you put the charge near the bed, in the workplace, in the kitchen, in the car, and place the phone on the platform when not in use, the phone will always be charged. <br><br>  That is, without making any effort to charge the phone - it will always be charged. <br><br><ul><li>  keep the phone not under the pillow, and near the bed </li><li>  put not on the seat in the car, and in the phone holder </li><li>  put not just on the table near the computer, but on the stand </li></ul><br>  The same daily activities will always lead to a charged phone. <br><br><h4>  Why do I think this is the future? </h4><br>  10 years ago, wifi in hotels was considered a convenient feature.  Now is a necessary thing. <br><br>  2 years ago, payment via NFC was new and almost never used.  Now - almost every second payment in Russia is made contactless. <br><br>  In the near future - wireless charging will be in all new models of phones, hotels, restaurants, cars, desks. <br><br>  For example, take England.  In hotels, hostels, chain restaurants already have wireless charging.  Now there are about 5,000 of them, but the number of places with charges is actively growing in France, Germany and the USA.  Even in Russia there are several network establishments who also charge themselves. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/u4/bn/xc/u4bnxcpyezzuopnr2q49w99g9lg.jpeg"><br>  <i>The wireless charging card in England is on the left, the pub map is on the right.</i>  <i>Potential huge :)</i> <br><br>  The technology is not 100% working yet.  There is still potential to improve it (increasing the charging zone up to 2-3 cm, power up to 20W and some more commercial improvements for charging the mass of the market), but now the advantages of such charging outweigh the disadvantages. <br><br>  In a few years, the lack of wireless charging will be equal to the absence of wifi in the hotel today - you will not even stay in this place. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/454994/">https://habr.com/ru/post/454994/</a></p>
