  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Behavioral contextual advertising in WEB 2.0 and payment for the result.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Long studies of this issue, led me to some interesting thoughts that I would like to discuss and find like-minded people interested in this topic. <br>  We begin by collecting information about the user's behavior on the Internet, its consumer preferences and social status. <br>  Where to get the necessary information for the behavioral targeting of an advertisement? <a name="habracut"></a>  Social network users fill out questionnaires with personal data in their profiles, combine into interest groups, write blogs on specific topics, visit thematic sites, and finally, share their opinions with other social members.  networks, give advice and write reviews. <br>  All this information can be used to effectively display an ad (banner) focused on the interests of this particular user or group of users (for example, groups on thematic interests of the social network).  This greatly increases the effectiveness of advertising, increases ad clickability and is not very annoying, because  This advertisement should cause a subconscious interest. <br>  Where does all this apply?  Yes, actually, in the same social networks and multiblog systems.  Especially effective will be shows on thematic media portals. <br><br>  And the second question that I would like to discuss is contextual advertising and technology for pay per action or per action result - PPA (Pay Per Acton). <br>  For almost a year, ‚ÄúRunner‚Äù has been testing this type of contextual advertising with pay per action, but I was not able to get any specific information on this subject after attending the ‚ÄúRunner‚Äù seminar :) <br>  This type of advertising is the most effective and beneficial for both advertisers and webmasters who host such an advertising blog.  The main advantages of PPA: <br>  1. The actual exclusion of sklikivaniya advertising budget, detractors or well-wishers :) <br>  2. Significant cost savings advertiser. <br>  3. The advertiser is charged only when the clicked person performs the necessary action, for example, places an order, fills out a form, etc. <br>  4. Traffic in this direction is more targeted than PPC (pay per click). <br>  And now I would like to discuss the disadvantages of this technology and perhaps, in the discussion, find the answer to my question. <br>  For example, we have a thematic portal on cell phones, on it we place a block of contextual advertisements with pay-per-action (per result).  The advertising system robot indexes the page theme and displays ads according to the context.  I liked the announcement of the sale of a mobile phone, I click on the link and go straight to the checkout page, fill out the form and wait for delivery by courier, ordered phone. <br>  So I completed the <strong>action by placing an order</strong> , with the advertiser withdrew money for it, but then I by phone refuse delivery and cancel the order.  It turns out that the advertiser spent the money for nothing.  This is the first bummer in the PPA system.  What can you offer? <br>  Or let's say, under the <strong>action we understand the completion of the transaction between the seller and the buyer</strong> .  I get the phone, give the money to the courier, the courier hands over the money to the online store, the store closes the transaction in the system, the store system sends the data about the completion <strong>of the transaction</strong> to the advertising network and only after that the money is taken from the advertiser.  It seems that everything is fine, but how to protect yourself from unscrupulous advertisers who can hide the fact of the transaction and click on advertising will not be paid? <br>  So far I see one way, it is payment of goods with electronic money or a credit card, in this case the fact of the transaction will be confirmed almost instantly.  But the realities of the Russian Internet suggest that buyers rarely pay for goods in online stores with electronic money.  From here and a question for discussion, how to automate the fact of a transaction when paying in cash? <br>  And the third question is the combination of behavioral and contextual advertising with pay per result. <br>  I tried to promote this topic as promising in Yandex and Mail.ru, but was quietly sent to my letter so no one answered :) <br>  And so I decided to try to build my thematic web-project <a href="http://mj1.ru/"><strong></strong></a><strong><a href="http://www.mj1.ru/">www.MJ1.ru</a></strong> , on which I want to try out the technologies described above.  The site is in the process of filling thematic content.  I want to find like-minded people, and maybe partners to work on such a system. </div>
