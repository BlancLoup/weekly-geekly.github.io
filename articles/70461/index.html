  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Overview of e-Learning Trackers or Live and Learn!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Increasingly, one can hear about universal monster trackers such as ThePirateBay.org, torrents.ru, or references to trackers of musical or game themes.  But besides them, there have long been torrent trackers of a training orientation, about which little is known to the average user.  Basically, these are closed communities of educated people with invitation registration that exchange educational materials, such as e-books, educational videos, CBT (computer based trainings), audio books, presentations from conferences or software for training.  The majority of materials are related to IT technologies and therefore will be especially useful for IT professionals, from a student studying Linux, PHP or C # to a guru who is preparing for the CCIE.  Also there is a material devoted to the study of foreign languages, psychology, self-development, seduction, development of business skills.  If you are thinking of taking CCNA, MCSE, RHCE, CISSP, Network +, PMP, IELTS / TOEFL and so on - then you can find everything you need and even more.  Under the cat there is a review of the English-language learning resources. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Review participants: </h3><br><ol><li>  Bitspyder <br><img src="http://s61.radikal.ru/i171/0909/00/3367edb23053.png"><br>  Perhaps the best of all presented due to its excellent community.  Most of the exclusive material that eventually spreads to all of the trackers below appears here.  What you need only to look at the list of exclusive hands.  The most delicious thing that distinguishes this tracker from the rest is the presence of a so-called procedure.  GroupBuy (Group buying), when the site‚Äôs members are interested in an interesting, but unavailable material, who can / wants how much.  When the required amount is collected, a verified user is determined who buys, rips and puts this training course on the site.  In the first 30 days, it is available only to users who participated in GroupBuy, then this restriction is removed.  Many scenes of the group were convicted of laying out exclusive material downloaded from BS under their own name.  In addition to the tracker itself, there are sections of GeekTV, GeekNews - interesting videos and news added by users of the site, TechForums - here you will find stories about the process of preparing and passing on different certificates with links to materials that were used in training, which is invaluably useful.  It should be noted that a great number of tsiskov dwells on this resource, hence the tons of content for certification by Cisco.  For information security (my profile), there is also a lot to find here.  Proof pictures: <br><br>  <a href="">Statistics</a> <br>  <a href="">List of hands</a> <br>  <a href="">Exclusive Distributions</a> <br><br><br></li><li>  Bitme <br><img src="http://s04.radikal.ru/i177/0909/97/d8d09d8da812.gif"><br>  Some put BitMe on the same level with BitSpyder.  Also a unique tracker from BitMeTv owners.  A little too high excitement is explained by the low availability of invitations.  Invites are available only to PowerUser (upload&gt; 50 GB).  Not everyone will find training material at 50 Gig.  GroupBuy is prohibited by the rules here.  It is very difficult to keep a rating.  By the quantity and quality of the presented content, you can safely put it in second place.  In general, we look at the screenshots:

          data-ad-layout="in-article"

      <br>
      <a href="">Statistics</a> <br>  <a href="">List of hands</a> <br><br>  On BitSpyder and BitMe there are strict rules and it is very difficult to keep a rating, especially without their hands.  Therefore, I recommend beginners to start with the lower trackers LearnBits and Elbitz. <br><br></li><li>  Learnbits <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2d6/572/5c2/2d65725c2128e5049eb1a2d9cf6e92da.jpg"><br>  LearnBits may be interested in easy accessibility, a good bonus system for seeding distributions (accurate for weak channels), it is easy to keep a rating, often freerich is arranged.  In general, what you need for a beginner. <br>  Screenshots: <br><br>  <a href="">Statistics</a> <br>  <a href="">List of hands</a> <br><br><br></li><li>  Elbitz <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/23d/8e3/146/23d8e31465cb241909008c3548b9300b.jpg"><br>  Another low-level tracker for beginners.  Periodically arrange open days at which you can freely register.  Some time ago it was just a dump of files, without much description, a lot of duplicates, left content.  Now the order seems to put things.  Rating is very easy to keep because of the large influx of users on open days. <br>  Screenshots: <br><br>  <a href="">List of hands</a> <br><br><br></li></ol><br>  MyAnonaMouse.Net, bttrove.org, TheVault.bz have not been reviewed yet, I have no accounts there, so I cannot describe it in detail.  In short, on the first one you can find fiction, materials on learning to play musical instruments, the second one specializes in design, 3D modeling, the third one is purely a business topic. <br><br><br>  There are invitations to LearnBits and BitSpyder.  With joy I will invite worthy habra people. <br>  Write to what tracker is required, only to whom it is really <b>necessary</b> (and not to be), I will send it to habraposhta. <br><br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> On BitSpyder, there will soon be frilich (the time when downloading is not taken into account in statistics, only upload) and the contest.  When it starts and how long it will continue will be shown by a new ad (you will notice it).  So I advise you not to miss this chance.  :) <br><br>  <b>UPD2:</b> Due to the limited number of BitSpyder invites, requests for this tracker from people with karma&gt; = 5 are accepted. <br><br>  <b>UPD3:</b> Invites for BitSpyder are over, requests are only accepted on LearnBits. <br>  For those who received invites: remember that the inviter and the invitee are related to each other by an invisible thread of responsibility to each other.  :) <br><br>  <b>Additionally, screenshots on popular trackers</b> (we say thank you <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/nothing/" class="user_link">nothing</a> ): <br><ul><li>  <a href="">ThePlace.bz</a> </li><li>  <a href="">TheVault.bz</a> </li><li>  <a href="">Pure torrent</a> </li><li>  <a href="">Bibliotik</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/70461/">https://habr.com/ru/post/70461/</a></p>
