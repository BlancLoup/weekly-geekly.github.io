This damn motivation.  These goals I do not need.  These meaningless organizational changes.  These leaders try to motivate me.  These threats, exhortations, taking "on the weak", stories about success stories, "and here I am, when I was like you," phrases from books on motivation.  This "team" that discusses everyone who has gone for a smoke.  These colleagues from other "teams" who hate, despise or ignore me, and ours, and their "team." <br><br>  No one and nothing can motivate me.  Worst of all, in this case - trying.  Your attempts are pitiful, ridiculous, disgusting.  Because you yourself are the same as me.  You do not understand why you came here.  You also disgust this work, these goals, objectives and projects.  Even more you sickened by the need to motivate me.  You are literally turned up by this duty, which is perfectly expressed in your squalid attempts, conversations and ‚Äúcoordination of tasks‚Äù. <br><br>  Sit down, relax, and calm down.  Don't motivate me.  In the first paragraph, I joked.  I can do everything myself.  Do not interfere only. <a name="habracut"></a>

      There are a lot of motivators in the world, their application and effectiveness are purely individual.  I will talk a little about those that I use for myself. <br><br><h4>  Anger </h4><br>  One of my favorite motivators, because  gives a very strong effect on a short period of time.  What is interesting - you can be angry at anything, it still helps. <br><br>  When I'm angry, I work very well.  I literally rip tasks into pieces, and any.  It is especially pleasant that, under the influence of anger, I easily and quickly solve tasks with which I did not want to work in a normal state.  Just because I'm angry. <br><br>  Basically, anger comes from the outside - someone knocked out at work, a colleague or a boss, or a client, or some kind of situation.  It happens that I bring anger to work from outside - traffic jams, someone cuts, the government, I was looking for parking for a long time (‚Äúyes, my mother for his leg, who thought of renting an office in the center of the city‚Äù), there is no money, the tap has flowed, the TV has broken (two a day ago it was), a cat in a nassal shoe (it was this morning), the headphones at home forgot, someone took something from my desk, etc.  It's all individually. <br><br>  Actually, all that needs to be done is to throw out energy into solving problems, and not try to quench the anger.  If you sit and do nothing, then anger, this gift of fate, will soon pass.  Or I, being a kind person, will forgive the offender, and begin to smile again, or anger, if you keep her mind off for a long time in your head, but do nothing, go into depression or apathy.  Then there will be no explosion of performance - anger will pass for nothing. <br><br>  If possible, it is better not to try to eliminate the cause of anger.  But no need to inflate.  The more you think about the anger itself, the less you do useful things.  If you stupidly sit down and work, then anger quickly becomes impersonal - you, however, no longer remember who you are angry at and for.  Just sit, angry as the Hulk, and herachish.  Angry easily changes the application object.  For example, it jumps from traffic jams to a task.  As they say, whoever came to hand is angry at that.  It is enough to choose the object, and then everything will be fine. <br><br>  There are downsides.  You can‚Äôt be angry for a long time - depression will roll back anyway, so it‚Äôs necessary, sooner or later, to get out of this state.  I try to keep anger during the working day, but closer to its end - to stop, so as not to drag negative emotions home.  Even being evil, it is easy and even pleasant to offend someone - it does not matter in a personal conversation, or in correspondence.  Therefore, I try to avoid communication in this state - only work on tasks.  Also, the disadvantages include an increasing number of debugging on debugging - due to the emotional tension, you stop noticing obvious errors.  Well, if you get angry for too long, apathy or depression will still roll. <br><br><h4>  Guilt </h4><br>  Also a great motivator, at least for me.  Moreover, it works only wine, with which I agree.  And I agree only with the fault that I feel.  Accordingly, if someone is ‚Äúguilty‚Äù of me, I will not feel it - there will be a protest inside, as a natural reaction to attempts to manipulate me. <br><br>  I prefer to manipulate myself.  For example, errors in my code work well for me.  I have been engaged in programming for a long time, twenty years already, and I have formed a definite opinion about myself (this is not self-esteem, but an assessment of myself).  Not to say that it is a professional honor, but the detected jambs in my code act quite well, though not always.  A man found a mistake, told me, and didn‚Äôt seem to be manipulating me - and inside he was already feeling guilty.  And I rush to correct. <br><br>  And, I rush so that I throw everything.  Not always, of course - there are cases that you will not give up.  Or errors such that I do not consider them as errors.  But, basically, it hurts me and motivates.  Roughly speaking, I want to restore the status quo, in my own eyes - like I am a decent programmer. <br><br>  Sometimes I induce guilt in myself.  For this it is enough something a little profkapit.  Do not write to the client, for example.  Or not to fulfill the undertaken obligation, especially if it is to itself.  Right now, for example, I am conducting an experiment on weight loss using engineering methods.  If in the morning it turns out that it was in vain that in the evening I fattened myself with bread and bread, then there is a feeling of guilt towards myself.  It translates into motivation - not to observe the regime today, but to solve problems.  As if trying to compensate for one another. <br><br>  And this feature - the depersonalization of the object - I quite like that in the feeling of guilt, that in anger.  It is to blame for the violation of the regime, and work out the solution of problems.  In books on psychology I read that guilt feelings behave something like this ‚Äî it causes a burning desire to get rid of it, in any way.  The easiest is to ask for forgiveness.  But if you blame yourself, then, it seems, there is no such need. <br><br>  I just sit and herachu.  It turns out a little better than with anger - the disadvantages are less.  For example, concentration is not lost, you normally see mistakes, you do not offend anyone, and in general you behave yourself quite well, like any guilty person in some way. <br><br>  Lack of guilt feelings - it goes even faster than anger.  Productivity increases very seriously, so problems are solved quickly, and the problem solved is the price paid for the blame.  When the "debt" is given - the feeling of guilt passes, and again I did a good job. <br><br>  The main, probably, lack of such a motivator is that it cannot be used often.  With the psyche, the jokes are bad, and if you constantly feel your guilt for strength, then you can become a complete loser who always owes something to someone.  Therefore - a couple of times a month, no more. <br><br><h4>  purpose </h4><br>  The whitest and most furry, at first glance, motivator.  At the same time, from the point of view of employers (if they knew my goals) - the nastiest, harmful, dishonest and vile.  For one simple reason - no one ever knows the goals that I pursue at work. <br><br>  But this is a necessary measure.  I would be happy not to invent goals for myself, if the employer could offer them - such that they would spark me.  But in my practice this has never happened before.  All the goals I wanted, I came up with myself.  The part was voiced by the employer, some of the voiced he even took as his goal, but there was always a hidden part. <br><br>  It is not hidden because it is contrary to the goals of the employer - just the opposite.  We have to hide it because the bosses do not like to mess with the goals of their subordinates.  I once wrote an article on this topic - about identifying the personal goals of people, and finding a common vector to achieve the goals of the company served to achieve the goals of employees.  But, in practice, I have not met a single employer who would be engaged in this work. <br><br>  This is quite a difficult task - to talk, and to talk before that, and to gain trust before it, find out a personal goal, go think and match with the goal of a department or company, find common ground, expand the company's goal so that it helps the employee‚Äôs personal goal.  This is a whole project, and it is not carried out according to the patterns, there are no requirements, scale or time limits.  Therefore, no one does. <br><br>  It is much easier to declare the goal - you should strive for something, act that way, be good, kind, responsive, or vice versa - strict, sing songs, march in the stand, plump at corporate parties, learn values ‚Äã‚Äãand mission, etc. .  Yeah, ran up. <br><br>  For its purpose easier and more interesting.  She motivates only by the fact that she is mine.  As one author said you don‚Äôt like - ‚ÄúI work in a structure for myself,‚Äù while achieving the goals of the structure.  As a rule, it is better and faster than those who simply pretend that they are working to achieve the goals of the company, but do not have their own goals. <br><br>  Having my goal, I have any task in the context of this goal.  Everything is simple there - each task corresponds to my goal by a certain percentage.  You can, of course, introduce a complex characteristic, since  Speech about vectors, but better not to bother.  There are tasks that have a negative impact on my goal.  What to do with them? <br><br>  It's simple - to solve them as quickly as possible, so as not to interfere.  If you can not refuse to perform, then there is no point in resisting.  Make and forget.  A new task will work on my goal. <br><br>  In the context of the work, this is similar to stalking, in terms of Carlos Castaneda - observing the worlds around us, in order to control oneself and interact more effectively with reality.  While colleagues, who have not accepted the goals of the company, and not having their own goals, get stuck in a viscous job, not rejecting and not accepting it to the end, I make an informed choice - well, as far as I can, if not angry and have no feelings of guilt. <br><br>  Objectively I understand for each task, it helps in achieving my goals, or not.  Consciously decide whether to do it or not.  I understand, I spend time in vain, or build my future.  Besides, they pay me for it. <br><br>  The goal, as a motivator, is long-term - this is its advantage.  She does not come and does not leave under the influence of circumstances, because  is a product of personal choice only.  The goal is always with me, any day, as if he did not pass.  It does not need to be induced artificially.  Although, of course, when I am angry or feel guilty, the goal fades into the background. <br><br>  The long-term, constant presence of a goal in the subconscious is also a disadvantage, because, over time, it fades away, begins to be forgotten, loses its influence on motivation.  Especially in hot periods at work, when you have to herach all day long, without any motivators (or do I just not see them?).  Consciousness is easily addicted to any nonsense, like deadlines, and replaces personal goals with surrogate ones - those that are set at work.  And when problems are solved, desolation comes - you understand that you fought with windmills, and you personally, from a project that was closed on time, a satisfied customer, some indicators of benefit are exactly zero. <br><br>  Therefore, you need to remind yourself of the goal.  He came in the morning, poured coffee, and, without turning on the computer (or he would delay it), he remembered that he was pinned at all.  I thought about the goal.  I remembered the benefits of achieving it.  I figured how the process of achievement goes.  I looked at the task list, re-prioritized - so that the goal was reached faster and not met anywhere.  All day will be good. <br><br>  There are a lot of people like me.  Often people told me in informal conversations about their goals pursued at work - they wanted to boast, it seems like they are sitting there for good reason, like everyone else.  According to my observations, these people were more successful than their colleagues.  They were driven by something, something from the inside, a motor, an engine, a spark ‚Äî it doesn't matter what we call it.  They are easier to accept the goals of the company - well, more precisely, they are taking to work, less snot on the walls smears that some goals are not so.  Well, achieve these goals faster and better.  I thought so. <br><br>  How do you motivate yourself? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/456996/">https://habr.com/ru/post/456996/</a></p>
