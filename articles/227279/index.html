Today, we will look through the looking glass for how the information about new updates is ‚Äúleaked‚Äù - in particular, for example, we‚Äôll reveal the cards and honestly admit where we were the first to know that a rotation had appeared in the issue of Yandex. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Any search engine conducts updates issuing, search algorithm and other aspects.  One thing unites them all: updates try not to reveal and even, if possible, not to advertise just so that all sorts of black SEO do not sharpen their methods for the new algorithm.  For a simple user, this is not very noticeable - an invisible struggle, as a rule, is conducted according to the so-called ‚Äúcommercial inquiries‚Äù - for example, ‚Äúplastic windows‚Äù - will you often type this in a search?  One, two times in my life - you will hardly notice that something has changed.  Unless sometimes it is impossible to find a site that was previously easily searched for and was ‚Äúat hand‚Äù - this is the only way to notice that, most likely, this was another ‚Äúupdate‚Äù.

      All that is known about the updates of a wide audience - this is a certain estimated frequency.  For example, updating the search results of Yandex is made on average once every 6 days.  Guess yourself who is waiting for this every time with trepidation and why. <br><br>  At this time, the ‚Äúlooking-glass‚Äù of the Internet industry ‚Äúmirrored‚Äù an interesting picture: during the last two updates, on June 12 and 21, a number of sites disappeared from the issue by commercial inquiries and the young new generation took their place.  Good riddance, not very sorry - you think.  However, we are talking here about information leakage, the analysis of which made it possible to conclude that Yandex included a site rotation system in the new algorithm - and this will soon become a well-known sensation (in narrow circles). <br><br><h5>  How is the "leak"? </h5><br>  Information rules the world.  A search engine is a Klondike of information about users and sites.  Therefore, who has this information, that and Yandex (or Google).  However, the collection of this information is not prohibited by law, so there are tools that scan the search engine for changes.  In some ways, this looks like stock and currency quotes - an equally interesting ‚Äúlandscape‚Äù is obtained.  Search engines are ‚Äúclosing down‚Äù from such initiatives, for example, forcing you to enter a captcha (did anyone notice?) - but this is a sure sign that a seoshnik started somewhere near you. Well, or that the company has one IP and a couple dozen of employees left something to google). <br><br>  However, for every tricky labyrinth there is a new way with a screw: the so-called SERP trackers, collecting information about the rating of sites for issuing requests, use captcha bypass means, often very effective, because they use the cheap labor of hired droids and Karebelizia and Krablyanyan (according to numerous requests of schoolchildren from these countries, their names have been changed). <br><br>  It works like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aaf/f2c/3bc/aaff2c3bcb598f68e97ef05b1f00b86d.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Creating such a database of queries over time is not a cheap pleasure: even despite the low cost of solving a captcha.  In the case of a large number of large projects, only the collection of information of this kind can result in a monthly budget of 9-12 thousand rubles. <br><br>  There are not so many large systems, but since we have access to the colossal base of MegaIndex, it was with the help of it that we managed to conduct fairly simple and accurate observations (remember, information rules the world?).  Let us consider an example with a change in the issuance at the request of "plastic windows" in the Moscow region for June 21 and 12.  This is what the system produces: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/437/ba2/497/437ba2497b41bd1d0b10d55250b3348a.png" alt="image"><br><br>  A full analysis can be viewed with MegaIndex <a href="https://www.megaindex.ru/index.php%3Fgrant%3Ddirector%40altweb.ru:d16268c0f6aa0cb8b088144a842ff06a%26tab%3DwordAnalyze%26do%3DwordAnalyze%26date%5B2014-06-21%5D%3D2014-06-21%26date%5B2014-06-12%5D%3D2014-06-12%26word%3D%25EF%25EB%25E0%25F1%25F2%25E8%25EA%25EE%25E2%25FB%25E5%2520%25EE%25EA%25ED%25E0%26se_id%3D1%26region_id%3D0%26from%3D2">here</a> , however, so that you do not have to peer into small letters for a long time, we have already made a comparison and noticed: <br><br>  1. Sites that were on the first positions, remained in their places <br>  2. Some of the sites that were in the middle of the first hundred, have risen markedly.  This happened as a result of falling out of the TOP100 sites in front of them. <br>  3. Sites that were below a certain position (on average, below the 40th place), fell out of the TOP100.  New projects appeared in their places. <br><br>  Thus, the update of the algorithm, which has made such a large-scale change, obviously contains ‚Äúsomething else‚Äù.  This "something" is the <b>introduction of rotation sites in the issue</b> . <br><br>  If you want to make sure of what is happening, here are some more statistics on the requests " <a href="https://www.megaindex.ru/index.php%3Fgrant%3Ddirector%40altweb.ru:df6b9e0cd12c00ee1232fa6ebf7a8f43%26tab%3DwordAnalyze%26do%3DwordAnalyze%26word%3D%25E3%25F0%25F3%25E7%25EE%25E2%25FB%25E5%2520%25EF%25E5%25F0%25E5%25E2%25EE%25E7%25EA%25E8%26se_id%3D1%26date%5B2014-06-12%5D%3D2014-06-12%26date%5B2014-06-06%5D%3D2014-06-06%26from%3D2">freight traffic</a> " and " <a href="https://www.megaindex.ru/index.php%3Fgrant%3Ddirector%40altweb.ru:535bb649dc1475af17996ac6681569b9%26tab%3DwordAnalyze%26do%3DwordAnalyze%26date%5B2014-06-12%5D%3D2014-06-12%26date%5B2014-06-06%5D%3D2014-06-06%26word%3D%25F2%25F3%25F0%25FB%26se_id%3D1%26region_id%3D0%26from%3D2">tours</a> ". <br><br><h5>  What is the site rotation in the issue? </h5><br>  In fact, a harmless innovation, giving a chance to sites that users have never found before - to appear in the search.  It would seem, what does the word "behavioral"?  And despite the fact that since this is a kind of ‚Äútrend of the year‚Äù, it is quite possible to assume that such a step will provide an opportunity to show the user sites that are not potentially ‚Äúlinked‚Äù with links and keys and allow the user to wander through this site and find out the extent of his (user) activity on it.  Based on this, the site can either be left in the issuance, or again "throw out" it and try on, trying to remove from the issue sites, which one of the MOZ speakers speaks of: <br><br><blockquote>  Dear websites, which look so rotten, but promise a lot in words - that's who you are: </blockquote><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/933/d81/275/933d812750a4ad3fb3d9b0adc08095fd.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Thus, there is a chance that, thanks to this rotation, the "filthy" sites will disappear somewhere, and more decent will take their place - this is the likely essence of the changes. <br><br>  Although Yandex does not advertise what it is doing this summer, however, analytics of data about the current situation can provide first-hand information about the whole industry.  How to use this information everyone decides for himself.  We hope that it has come into your hands for creating and improving explanatory websites.  If so, then remember: yes, you have a chance.  But the captain of evidence is not tired of reminding: keep in mind that people will walk on your site - it is up to them to decide who you are and where you will be in the near future.  At least, the new changes fit well with the policy of Yandex announced at the beginning of the year regarding the consideration of <a href="http://www.serpclick.ru/">behavioral factors</a> . <br><br>  The business analyst for the Internet industry itself is widely available, and the ability to draw the right conclusions allows you to see the whole picture, even where information from other sources is not disclosed.  We will continue to keep you updated on what is happening this summer - stay with us. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/227279/">https://habr.com/ru/post/227279/</a></p>
