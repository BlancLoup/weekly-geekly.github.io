I am a manager - developer - business analyst, I don‚Äôt know who is more, but definitely not in the direction of a programmer ... <br><br>  I know meta-CMS DJEM (unfortunately, paid and expensive, 22 thousand rubles + for a license) and CMF ModX (unfortunately, there is not everything as cool as we want).  I want to study 1 more CMF, a choice between Symfony, Django and CodeIgniter.  CakePHP for some reason do not like.  I do not want, I will not, remove - it is on a subconscious level, probably.  :) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Objective 1, ‚Äúto create modern complex and non-standard sites / services‚Äù, here are the requirements for the platform: <br>  - the ability to create a serious solution that can withstand high loads (traffic exchangers, for example) <br>  - the use of modern technology (Mootools and Ext JS, I mean, well, in general, AJAX wherever it is needed) <br>  - speed of assembly and the ability to build without immersing yourself in complex processes of the kernel and how it all works, the result is important and the development time the smaller the better (with the same quality). <br>  - ease of management (admin panel), that is, not just a la add to the table / remove from the table, only programmers think the tables, and for the rest, the CPA is needed (my term, just came up, human-friendly admin panel :)). <br>  - separation of access rights so that it can be divided into groups and link users to groups of documents (probably better to say, objects) and actions on them. <br>  - A large number of extensions (or the possibility of writing them), allowing you to quickly create mail forms, generate multi-level menus, in general, up to a basket of orders and an online store.

      Objective 2: make a meta-CMS, a copy of the DJEM, here is a description of how I see the ideal meta-CMS for our business: <br><br>  At DJEM, I LOVE such a thing as content templates (KS) and design templates (LH).  The first ones define document fields (title, introduction, main part, tags, for example), and the usual templates are stored in LH, where you can call any element by its name (current document, parent. You can set content types for different sections in the page tree and start filling. That is, we have types of input elements (field, list, field with WHYIWYG-editor, checkboxes, date, etc.), we do this from KSH and bind each page to KS. Then we fill it in LH fields from KSh.There is still a default KSh and LH, that is, in the joint venture  the suit is chosen which KSh and LH will have subdocuments, by default it is equal to KSh and LH of the current document. <br>  This is the principle I found only in 2 systems, one is expensive, the second is somewhat unfinished, it works slowly and does not know how to do everything.  + ModX has some database design errors (at least 2).  I need a system that would allow me to do what I wrote. <br>  You can probably write it on any CMF, but somewhere it will be convenient, somewhere you will have to pervert, you probably know better than me. <br><br>  Tell me, what did I write (2 goal) really do through those CMFs that I listed? .. Which is better to study? .. <br><br>  That is, we want to make some prototype (meta-CMS as DJEM, only free and in PHP / Python, in general) and use it for making sites that we are ordered.  Or is it advantageous to sit on ModX and wait for the new version, resigned to the fact that it works slower than you want and have more modest features than you need? <br><br>  Thanks for answers.  I appeal to programmers in general.  Sorry, if I understand something less than you, but I ask you not to beat painfully, I have a slightly different job, my goal is to make websites as soon as possible, a bit more difficult for typical + to have some tool for non-standard sites. <br><br>  Question to the lawyers, if they are there.  The system created on the basis of CMF can be sold with an indication of what it is done on?  Will it not violate the license or will it still? <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/21523/">https://habr.com/ru/post/21523/</a></p>
