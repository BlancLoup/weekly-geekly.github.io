As investment dynamics show, money literally flowed like a river immediately after the opening of the summer round of financing.  Suffice it to say that the brokerage agencies Morgan Stanley and SF Sentry Securities scored a big payoff in the form of a commission on purchases of the company's shares - $ 32 million for two. <br><br>  As Business Insider accurately notes, the company Palantir Technologies doesn‚Äôt dare to call a startup, given that the project appeared more than 10 years ago (in 2004) and as of today has about 2,000 employees.  However, a private company continues to attract venture capital investments in the status of a startup and does not plan to turn into a public company in the near future with the possibility of acquiring shares for everyone.  Currently, the cost of Palantir Technologies is estimated at $ 20 billion.

      Most recently, we <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/22618/">wrote</a> about the company attracting investments in the amount of about 130 million dollars.  Thus, taking into account the latest round of financing for today, the company has managed to attract about $ 2 billion. <br><br>  However, it is not surprising that the company prefers to remain a private enterprise, taking into account the specifics of its activities.  It is known that Palantir Technologies is engaged in the analysis and processing of various data, applying its development to predict and solve various problems in the field of economics, information security and the military sector.  Among the company's customers (which they don‚Äôt like to talk about directly) are 12 US government organizations, including the CIA, the FBI, the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, the Los Angeles Police Department, the United Agency for the Prevention of IEDs and others . <br><br>  The co-founder and investor of Palantir Technologies at an early stage of development was Peter Thiel, who belongs to the so-called mafia of PayPal (this term was first used in 2007 in Fortune magazine).  Mr. Thiel is also known for his past investments in Facebook, and now he is successfully engaged in venture investments in Silicon Valley. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297556/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297556/</a></p>
