In this article we will talk about what was prepared for you in the section JS.  Speakers from Microsoft, Booking, 2GIS, Wrike and Evil Martians will share their experiences using Preact, ClosureScript, React, JS for IoT and Angular. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  ¬ß On ‚Äúcombat‚Äù projects and real tasks </h2><br clear="all"><img width="250" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e4/39/59e4390f5a1e3794182268.jpeg" alt="Yegor Banshchikov">  When you work in a large company, it is a great success to participate in a project that you can write from scratch.  Such a chance fell to the development team at 2GIS, which was faced with the task of writing a new, <i>better</i> 2GIS. Online for mobile devices.  A stack of technologies, architecture, plug-in libraries ‚Äî behind all this are mountains of broken copies.  Prepare your ‚Äúwhy not Flow ?!‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhy React to the mobile phone when there is Preact ?!‚Äù, it will be hot!  How to live in a world where the size of the bundle is decided and every kilobyte counts, and the android browser laughs in the face of modern specifications, <a href="https://2017.frontfest.ru/lecture/17/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dnews%26utm_campaign%3Djs">we learn</a> from Yegor Banshchikov, a front-end developer from 2GIS. <br><br><br clear="all"><img width="250" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e4/39/59e43956865dc631656434.jpeg" alt="Kirill Chernyshov">  Each team has at least one crazy person who is trying to convince everyone to rewrite everything in Elm / ClojureScript / Reason.  It can be easily identified by phrases like: ‚Äúfunctional approach!‚Äù, ‚ÄúNo errors runtime!‚Äù, ‚ÄúPure functions!‚Äù, ‚ÄúOut-of-the-box immunity!‚Äù.  Of course, no one gave him a rewrite - they say that the newcomers will come, they will not understand anything.  So, they connected him with lodash / fp, so as not to twitch.  Do you recognize anyone?  Or maybe this madman - you, username?  Hugging.  Come to FrontFest, look at the man who could.  Kirill Chernyshov <a href="https://2017.frontfest.ru/lecture/21/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dnews%26utm_campaign%3Djs">will tell</a> about his experience of using ClojureScript in Aviasales.ru, and what it cost (and whether it was worth it).

If you are an old-timer of various IT conferences and specialized resources, then A / B testing will probably come to mind.  Booking is known for the fact that every change on the site goes through A / B testing, during which hundreds of different metrics are collected - from business-oriented to performance.  Anton Eprev <a href="https://2017.frontfest.ru/lecture/7/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dnews%26utm_campaign%3Djs">will tell the</a> story of one metric, namely about measuring the smoothness of scrolling the page on Booking.com.  How to collect such statistics, and most importantly - how to use it? <br><br><br clear="all"><img width="250" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e4/b1/59e4b16651998155278294.jpeg" alt="Aleksey Ivanov">  Angry Martian Aleksey Ivanov prepared a <a href="https://2017.frontfest.ru/lecture/13/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dnews%26utm_campaign%3Djs">report</a> for those who faced problems with rendering React-applications.  A long reaction to changes in checkboxes, freezes when editing text fields, prancing FPS animations - all this indicates that rendering your React application needs optimization.  Alexey's report will help to more deeply understand the logic of component rendering, the algorithm by which React stands VirtualDOM and transfers changes to the DOM.  In addition, Alexey will look at the subject from the data point of view and tell you how to organize them so that the application runs as quickly as possible. <br><br><br clear="all"><img width="250" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e4/3a/59e43acc494c0262767615.jpeg" alt="Ilya Taratukhin">  Ilya Taratukhin from Wrike this spring <a href="https://2017.codefest.ru/lecture/1180">spoke at CodeFest</a> , where he defended technology from Facebook on the Angular and React confrontation report.  Life is not devoid of irony and, of course, Ilya works in a company where Dart and Angular are honored.  Ilya prepared a report on how he (un) became depressed, rewriting the project under Angular, together with his team, created and rewrote the library of components and how he went through all the rakes and how we would not do the same.  <a href="https://2017.frontfest.ru/lecture/19/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dnews%26utm_campaign%3Djs">The report</a> will be especially useful to those who are interested in the details of work with change detection and events, as well as the problems of dynamic component creation.  For clarity, everything will be accompanied by examples of component design errors and the results to which such errors can lead.  Ilya will tell you how it was possible to avoid problems in such situations. <br><br clear="all"><br><h2>  ¬ß About javascript as a phenomenon and art </h2><br clear="all"><img width="250" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e4/3b/59e43b04e62c2945555950.jpeg" alt="Mathieu 'p01' Henri">  Mathieu 'p01' Henri works in the Norwegian office of Microsoft, and before that he worked for a long time in Opera.  He calls himself a creative developer and professes the ‚Äúcode as art‚Äù approach.  Henri will fly to us from Oslo in order to inspire you with your <a href="https://2017.frontfest.ru/lecture/15/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dnews%26utm_campaign%3Djs">performance</a> to be creative in your work, to experiment, to be creative, to have the flexibility of thinking, because all this makes you the best developer.  During his speech, he will show some unusual solutions, optimization techniques and right during the report will collect a small audio-visual demo.  Henri's speech will not be limited to just a report - on the same day Henri will hold a <a href="https://2017.frontfest.ru/lecture/16/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dnews%26utm_campaign%3Djs">workshop</a> , where he will write JavaScript in the real-time mode.  What is called, from theory to practice. <br><br><br clear="all"><img width="250" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e4/3b/59e43baca8f6f030624136.jpeg" alt="Franziska Klingner">  JavaScript was born as a simple language, designed to add a bit of interactivity to static HTML pages.  Today JS is a full-fledged programming language, and what's more, it is the most popular programming language in the world.  What JavaScript features made it so successful?  Someone appreciates the simplicity and accessibility for beginners, someone adores him for the closures inherited from Scheme and the functions are first-class objects.  This is just the tip of the iceberg.  Francis Klingner in his <a href="https://2017.frontfest.ru/lecture/2/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dnews%26utm_campaign%3Djs">report</a> will understand the secrets of the success of JavaScript and Node.js and tell how this ugly duckling managed to take over the world. <br><br><h2>  ¬ß About the basics </h2><br clear="all"><img width="250" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e4/3c/59e43c001495c081340337.jpeg" alt="Lyza Danger Gardner">  Lisa Danger Gardner has been working on JavaScript on Things for the last year and, in her footsteps, prepared a <a href="https://2017.frontfest.ru/lecture/24/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dnews%26utm_campaign%3Djs">report</a> for those who have already written a little code for browsers and who are looking towards the Internet of things.  Do you dream to create a robot that will bring your favorite drinks from the fridge while you watch the series, but have never done electrical engineering and only know JavaScript?  It's enough!  Lisa will indicate the path that everyone can take - from flashing lights to controlling complex and interesting devices. <br><br><br clear="all"><img width="250" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e4/3c/59e43c3b0f2f5493305454.jpeg" alt="Vladimir Dashukevich">  Vladimir Dashukevich will tell about the importance of understanding the basics.  In his <a href="https://2017.frontfest.ru/lecture/9/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dnews%26utm_campaign%3Djs">report</a> Algorithms and Data Structures Changing the Modern Frontend, he will tell you what data structures and algorithms work under the hood of modern libraries and frameworks, why you need to know this and when this knowledge can be useful. <br><br clear="all"><hr><br>  Let me remind you: we have already written about the section <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/2gis/blog/339212/">MIX</a> and <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/2gis/blog/339708/">VYORSTKA</a> , and there will still be streams of <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/2gis/blog/339708/">homeowners</a> and workshops.
