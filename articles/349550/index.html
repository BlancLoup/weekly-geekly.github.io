  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Quantum computing in the Fujitsu Digital Annealer computer</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  From the 40s of the last century to the present, there were four main technologies on which computers were based: from electronic tubes to microprocessors.  Since the first computers appeared, the need for an ever-increasing amount of computing resources has not stopped for a minute.  Quantum computer calculations are considered as one of the technologies of the next generation, which will allow to realize the full potential of artificial intelligence (AI). <br><br>  Computer Fujitsu Digital Annealer was developed based on and subject to the limitations of quantum computing.  In this article, we will talk about what it is for what it is intended. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/be/qk/yb/beqkybl5sbl30osex3drmhta2xw.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Although quantum computing is capable of processing a huge amount of information in a matter of seconds, which modern computers cannot, they also have a number of limitations.  While quantum computations are very expensive, they are difficult to implement in practice and specific conditions are required for their work.  In other words, quantum computing significantly increases capital and operating expenses, not to mention the emerging need for staff with appropriate qualifications to maintain the quantum infrastructure.

      For example, in order to achieve the correct output of quantum bits (by analogy with digital bits), they need to be in a superposition close to zero degrees, without any external interference.  If at least one of these conditions is not met, the results of the calculations will be incorrect.  Such stringent requirements for conditions make quantum computation difficult and inaccessible for many industries. <br><br><h3>  Limitations of classic computers found in the practical use of AI </h3><br>  It takes tremendous performance and a lot of computation time to take full advantage of AI.  The need for faster computers dictates a high level of scaling of integrated circuits and integrated circuits with three-dimensional structures. <br><br>  According to Moore's law, the density of transistors in integrated circuits will increase by 2 times every one and a half years.  Today this process has reached its limit. <br><br>  Quantum computing, which is based on fundamentally different laws, is considered as a key element that will allow you to give up the restrictions of Moore's law and build new platforms for realizing the full potential of artificial intelligence.  The development of AI will lead to the creation of new technologies and will cause large-scale cultural changes that will cause the emergence of "technological singularity." <br><br>  Quantum computers are based on quantum theory, which explains the phenomena that occur at the atomic and subatomic level, including the behavior of electrons.  In quantum mechanics, a phenomenon called ‚Äúsuperposition‚Äù refers to the simultaneous appearance of two different states: 0 and 1. This phenomenon forms the basis for ‚Äúquantum bits‚Äù that can significantly increase the speed of computational operations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/si/lq/c5/silqc5we32suxqfet5juhqzfppy.jpeg"><br>  <i>The difference between universal or classical and quantum computers</i> <br><br>  However, quantum computers are still in the making.  And although they are still far enough away from their practical application, humanity already needs tools for analyzing big data and the ability to use AI to solve immediate problems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lg/ub/_0/lgub_0n7iy1xpjyic_kdheyauhk.jpeg"><br>  <i>Computers today and tomorrow</i> <br><br><h3>  Computer Digital Annealer - implementation of quantum computing technology </h3><br>  Fujitsu has developed a futuristic computer based on a new architecture that takes advantage of both quantum and classical computers.  Among the various quantum computing methods on the market today, the Digital Annealer computer implements an annealing method that is focused <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/fujitsu/blog/327860/">on solving combinatorial optimization problems</a> .  The use of digital annealing technology does not require programming.  The user simply sets the key parameters on the basis of which the calculations are performed. <br><br>  When using the annealing method using original quantum devices, it is very difficult to maintain quantum states.  In addition, systems of this kind are large.  Also, quantum bits can only be connected to closely spaced quantum bits because of the need for their physical contact. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1d/12/lw/1d12lw5u9em4qquea0r9ardlez8.jpeg"><br>  <i>List of quantum computing methods</i> <br><br>  Fujitsu used traditional semiconductor technology and developed a Digital Annealer computer based on a new architecture that can quickly solve the problem of combinatorial optimization without additional costs and difficulties associated with quantum computing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/33/2m/od/332modo3w5ybl9nfcrqmkskmpe8.jpeg"><br>  <i>Quantum annealing method for solving combinatorial optimization problems</i> <br><br>  Digital Annealer is able to handle more complex computational tasks compared to other quantum annealing systems, since  Its fully connected structure allows devices to freely exchange signals within a single computer.  Moreover, it can operate at normal temperature without the need for cooling to maintain the temperature at an absolute zero (-273.15).  In addition, it has a relatively small size for installation in a data center rack, in contrast to real quantum computers.  Fujitsu now offers the Digital Annealer computer as a cloud service that any organization can access. <br><br><h3>  Practical application in various fields </h3><br>  Combinatorial optimization problems have existed for many years.  They are almost impossible to solve with the help of classic computers, because  the amount of calculations grows exponentially, even when the number of elements in the optimal combination increases slightly. <br><br>  <b>1. Optimization of product placement in enterprises and warehouses</b> <br><br>  In real-world application scenarios, many problems can be solved using combinatorial optimization.  For example, in enterprises and warehouses, a computer will quickly optimize working paths and product placement, minimizing the time it takes for employees to search for the desired product name.  The use of the Digital Annealer computer has reduced the employee‚Äôs distance by 45% per month within the same enterprise of the Fujitsu group of companies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cb/if/qt/cbifqtmu1aijpeirbbnic_hcvue.jpeg"><br>  <i>Optimized product distribution in the enterprise</i> <br><br>  <b>2. Personalized advertising in internet marketing</b> <br><br>  A selection of advertisements and articles published on the Internet may be modified in accordance with the characteristics of the target audience (for example, age and gender), if they are known in advance.  Providing characteristics data for each of the pages allows you to display personalized information to visitors. <br><br>  If there are 6 characteristics, only 720 ad combinations can be shown to a potential buyer.  And with 20 characteristics, the number of combinations increases to 2.43 quintillion (1 * 1018).  With the help of Digital Annealer, these complex calculations can be performed instantly. <br><br>  For the above technologies, there are many applications, including weather analysis and optimization of transport methods. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0f/ke/qr/0fkeqrrhbinfklswpafzotoyals.jpeg"><br>  <i>Offer paths optimized for a specific user.</i> <br><br>  <b>3. Low risk diversified financial investments</b> <br><br>  The Digital Annealer computer can be used to reduce risks by optimizing the investment portfolio.  For example, a set of stocks of 20 or more companies creates a large number of combinations (more than 1 quintillion) that classic computers are not able to handle.  Digital Annealer can instantly identify a less risky asset for investment, even while simultaneously holding 500 companies in the investment portfolio. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ve/ow/ui/veowui32pmrqnctm8efi1nr3c4u.jpeg"><br>  <i>Reducing investment risks by optimizing your investment portfolio</i> <br><br>  <b>4. Quick search for molecular similarity in drug development</b> <br><br>  Chemical laboratories and pharmaceutical companies often use the "molecular similarity search" method to develop new drugs.  If two molecules can be divided into atoms and the degree of coincidence can be determined, the search for similarity will show very high accuracy.  Unfortunately, this technique takes a lot of time, even when using powerful computers. <br><br>  Using the Digital Annealer computer, the search for the complete structure of the molecule can be performed very quickly, speeding up the development of new drugs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fj/9y/n3/fj9yn3lvw1mqaygbqaty8vqvbje.jpeg"><br>  <i>Search for molecular similarity in chemistry / pharmacy</i> <br><br><h3>  Digital Annealer computer opens up new opportunities for the future </h3><br>  Big data analysis and AI play an increasingly important role in creating innovations for businesses, so individual companies have already begun to invest in AI and intelligent data processing.  However, the difficulty with optimizing business processes lies in the fact that too many computational resources are required to solve many problems.  Now it can be solved with the help of quantum computing technologies. <br><br>  In 2018, companies will begin the practical use of quantum computing technologies.  And the Fujitsu Digital Annealer computer will help them in this, allowing you to easily and easily test hypotheses that previously required too much time and computing resources. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/349550/">https://habr.com/ru/post/349550/</a></p>
