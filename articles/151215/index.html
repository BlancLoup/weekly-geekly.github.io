No i don't know</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  Introduction </h4><br>  Recently, I increasingly come across <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/151091">thoughts of switching to a developer‚Äôs specialty</a> .  Whether it was a manager, consultant, military officer, nuclear physicist or landscape designer, everyone wanted to become programmers.  Let's try to figure out why this is happening and what it can lead to. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Motivating image: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ea2/b01/572/ea2b0157281ae77ba5cd4f3226a1b1d4.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Problem </h4><br>  Usually, newly-minted specialists up to 30 years old go into the developers.  And immediately there are several serious problems: <br><ul><li>  5-6 years lost on the study of subjects and sciences, which will never be needed; </li><li>  The necessary change of thinking from humanitarian / technical to logical / digital; </li><li>  Mastering a 5-6 year program of a technical university in the shortest possible time; </li><li>  Creating a threat to the lives and well-being of people, companies, businesses ... </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Time </h4><br>  The question is, why did a person study for several years the kinds of science he did not need?  Why subjected yourself to such mental stress?  To then drop everything and start all over again?  Even 5 years is a lot.  During this time, you can become a billionaire or get a Nobel Prize, so no, a person studies what he is not interested in, sleeps in pairs and says that philosophy is utter nonsense!

      Well, if he is studying in the paid department, and if at the expense of the state?  This means that someone who dreamed of becoming an architect, manager, financier, military, did not get to this place.  He had to look for another place under the sun, perhaps he went to study to be a programmer. <br><br><h4>  It's all simple there! </h4><br>  How many such latter-day ‚Äúprogrammers‚Äù have read about <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/4073388/">JAVA</a> from Bruce Ekkel.  They all consider themselves to be programming geniuses, and OOP, MVC, Agile, binary calculus, the theory of computational complexity ... not for them. <br><br>  I will give a few life examples: <br><ol><li>  "Programmer" writes the second version of the program.  In the first, there was one form for 50 buttons.  The second version has more functionality, but its logic is not so transparent.  It is planned to write the program a couple of months.  The functionality contains about 100 buttons on one form.  After a 10-minute introduction to graph theory, the number of buttons was reduced to one (point deletion), the term for writing a program was reduced to two days. </li><li>  "Programmer" was given the task to write a converter program.  The logic is simple: a packet of the form key = value comes, it is necessary to convert it into a packet2 of the key2 type = value2 and send further on a special table.  After two months of ‚Äúexploring the platform,‚Äù he was handed the application framework (packet reception, transformation, sending packets) by his older comrades.  A month later, the converter was ready! </li><li>  Many bikes sold; </li><li>  Speaking for himself <a href="http://govnokod.ru/">http://govnokod.ru</a> ; </li></ol><br>  I can only say one thing: if programming were so simple, then he would not be taught at universities for five years.  It would be enough for a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/151111/">three-month course</a> . <br><br><h4>  Talents </h4><br>  Of course, not to mention the talents.  There are talented people who are engaged in different jobs, they succeed everywhere.  But these are extremely few.  It is better to be a competent specialist in one area than in a few little ones. <br><br>  "Find a business for your soul and you will not work a single minute in life" - Confucius.  It is important not to spend on the search for this business all your life, otherwise you will have to "work hard" all your life. <br><br><h4>  Smell of gunpowder </h4><br>  A very good idea to show what a development is.  Smell gunpowder, so to speak!  Now <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/144540/">mayors began to study JS</a> . <br><br>  In one company, my friend and the entire customer service department showed how to typeset pages, told what tags are.  They even made simple pages. <br><br>  But you should not consider yourself after that knowing everything about programming.  This is just the beginning.  But then you need to learn a lot of complex and simpler materials and technologies, several volumes of algorithms and countless good practices and techniques. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  Programming is a craft, development is akin to art.  For ordinary people, this is magic; for programmers, hard work, translation of the inconstancy of the surrounding world into the world of final states, zeros and ones, limitations of the RAM, channel, and processor clock frequency. <br><br>  Nevertheless, I think most ‚Äúnew programmers‚Äù are trying to earn more: you sit for yourself - you get money.  True, then these people strongly let down their team, do not work in full force.  And if the authorities also close their eyes to this (yes, yes, it happens!), Then you will not cook porridge with them, you will not develop google. <br><br>  As <a href="">studies</a> show.  IT in Russia is not the highest paid industry.  It takes only third place.  Raw materials industries are in second place, and <a href="">top management is</a> in the first place.  Due to the specifics of IT, the programmer will never reach the top management level.  The maximum that is worth counting on is the position of head of department, lead direction, director of own company. <br><br>  Therefore, draw conclusions.  The change of occupation is a serious step, it should be thought out.  At a minimum, it will be necessary to study a modern programming course, and it will take more than one year. <br><br>  PS The comments ask about the goals of the note: take a serious attitude in choosing a profession, do only your favorite thing, learn what you like, grow professionally, and not try everything a bit without a specific goal.  Surprise people who in 30-40 years and could not find an occupation for the soul. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/151215/">https://habr.com/ru/post/151215/</a></p>
