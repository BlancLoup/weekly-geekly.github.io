      We have both in our store.  We put these two things together and as a result ... <br>  <i>- Hello, online store, hello Ivan Ivanovich.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Zdra ... how do you know that my name is Ivan Ivanovich ?!</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- We know our regular customers by sight!</i>  <i>What did you want to order?</i> <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The base of orders, where the names and phone numbers of customers are recorded, we have been doing for a very long time. <br>  And here we are lucky that almost all phone numbers are stored in our standardized form - 044xxx-xx-xx.  Due to this, having the caller's phone number, it is quite easy to get all orders from the base where the same number appeared. <br><br>  We have been recording customer calls for more than a year thanks to close integration with <a href="http://istat.com.ua/">iStat.com.ua</a> . <br>  And, in general, we have long understood that theoretically, we can guess by phone number who calls us if this person has ever made an order with us.  But for some reason this task seemed very difficult and was postponed for the distant future.  But recently, with the filing of one colleague, it was decided to implement it all the same, and it turned out that the task was completely simple! <br><br>  So, thanks to iStat.com.ua, we have a page where all customer calls for the selected period are displayed, by default - for the current day (just the call log is essentially).  In general, any call log from any asterisk will do.  we are the main thing that it was in real time and were incoming phone numbers. <br><br>  All that needs to be done is to add a couple of columns to this plate and another request to the database: ‚ÄúBut do we have a client‚Äôs phone number that matches the caller‚Äôs phone from the call log?‚Äù The base is large, so we had to play around for a while and - voila.  For each call, we find a match in the database of orders, if there are several matches, we take the client‚Äôs name from the most recent order, if he has ordered a lot of orders, we‚Äôve printed a number of orders along with a mouse over list. <br><br>  Here, in general, is the whole implementation.  As a result, it works like this: <br><br>  <b>1. When the call is heard, the manager picks up the phone and in parallel opens the tablet with the last 10 calls in the admin of the store</b> ( <b>10</b> were chosen, because this is sufficient for the task and minimizes the number of requests to the database. work to track customer by number). <br><br>  <b>2. According to the incoming phone number, the manager determines which of the current calls to the table answers his current conversation with the client.</b>  It's pretty easy, it's usually enough to compare the last 2 digits of the caller's phone number. <br><br>  <b>3. If the caller has ever ordered something in the store and his data is in the database - the manager sees them:</b> <br>  - whether this client called today, if yes, how many times. <br>  - how many times this customer has called in the past year. <br>  - what is his name, and if you hover the mouse over the name, you can see how it was presented in different orders <br>  - how many orders we have designed for all the time that we maintain a base.  If you hover the mouse on orders, a list of all orders is displayed. <br><br>  And this is how it looks live: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/5b9bc151/dfa835f1/bcb51ccc/f8999806.png"><br><br>  I can not express gratitude to our regular customer Petruha, who, as can be seen from the screenshot, made 239 calls a year.  He by the way is on Habr√©, but what is he called here I forgot partially. <br><br>  The plans still finish the list of links to all the recordings of calls of each client. <br>  Any other ideas on how to develop the system? .. <br><br>  And finally, if the engine of your online store does not allow you to make such "nyashechki", as an option, please contact us, we can. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/113847/">https://habr.com/ru/post/113847/</a></p>
