More often, unfortunately, - lovers on the march make us regret that access to the results of their works is so simplified.  Another story in support of this sad circumstance happened to me the other day. <br>  One of the best films of the past year, ‚Äú <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0465538/">Michael Clayton</a> ‚Äù, I managed to watch in English a month ago.  The film is really strong, it generally seems that Clooney has a great taste for the right films - rarely misses.  After watching, I wanted to show the film to friends and relatives, for which I went through a runet about the appearance of a Russian audio track (it was a bit early for a license to be released) - and came across a translation and dubbing of <a href="http://interfilm.ru/">Interfilm releasers</a> .  Those who know appreciate their work without particularly choosing the expression: ‚ÄúDo not spoil the normal picture with two-voiced bleatings behind the scenes.‚Äù  Understanding what ‚Äúamateur voice‚Äù is today, I decided to wait for the release of a licensed DVD with a good dubbing. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Yesterday, passing by the apparatus for sales of discs, I noticed a licensed DVD on the primary signs (DVD9, DTS, good printing, control mark) by the corner of my eye.  Without special hesitation paid 150 rubles (if it suddenly seems that it is cheap, then please note that the price of three pounds for a licensed edition of the film without bonuses is a rare, but sometimes occurring phenomenon in UK stores, for example, when it comes to sales or buying multiple DVDs).  After weighing all the pros and cons, bought the film ... <br>  ... and found a familiar translation on the disk. <br><br>  Guys, it does not go into any gate. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/0f6/f2b/0c6/0f6f2b0c6407e2256485fb021b9d2839.jpg" width="396" height="194" hspace="10" vspace="10">  The situation with the elementary correspondence of what the actor says and what the translator says is illustrated by screenshots (at the top is the English original text, at the bottom is what the translator said).  It's funny, if it were not so sad.  But this is only half the trouble. <br><br>  Speaking Russian text (the language doesn‚Äôt turn to call it a announcer or a backup) doesn‚Äôt care when his character speaks on the screen.  He simply spits out the text with a patter, almost without pauses, and much earlier than the phrase was spoken in English.  Some dialogs are simply completely ignored, remaining untranslated.

      Now who would explain to me now is it really so difficult to watch the film again with English subtitles after translation (the benefit of ‚ÄúMichael Clayton‚Äù is interesting to watch and for the second time because of its multiplicity, additional plot twists open after the next viewing) and see for sure (see illustrations) that 25 boxes are not 25 bucks at all.  That pregnant waitress Jennifer has nothing to do with the service and dishes.  That the warped translation completely kills the logic and content of the film - leaving the viewer in complete disbelief. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/d88/87f/460/d8887f4600801e952e24c03cca267259.jpg" width="408" height="203" hspace="10" vspace="10">  Who is this slapstick for?  Fans of blockbusters, who would be with a good translation, convinced of the absence of an abundance of explosions and blood, would they not begin to understand what is happening?  On film fans who turn off their absurdity after the first replicas?  The first conclusion - this circus is designed to re-inflate the buyer by pushing him another hack as a license.  I am not against the appearance of the devil-voiced dubbing of ‚Äúreleasers‚Äù on file sharing sites, I just do not recommend it to anyone to watch.  But when this hack gets out of the net, wraps itself in a glossy piece of paper and plays with the lights of the ‚Äúcontrol brand of licensed products‚Äù - here let me - this is looting in broad daylight.  Citizens, beware, they deceive you! <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/d42/2ca/a1a/d422caa1afd6067ba3ada9bdcf1e1ec6.jpg" width="404" height="202" hspace="10" vspace="10">  After emotions cool down, a protest comes: it's time to end this chaos at any cost.  Of course, I understand, web-two-zero, UGC and ‚Äúthe title of the national theater to many obligations‚Äù, summarizing - translate yourself, voice films, open the site, become popular and earn a living.  But conscience, too, must have.  The idea is not bad - to make good voice acting (subtitles) of great films.  And we get such a squiggle as a result? <br><br>  What can be done?  Decent films a year does not appear so much.  Offhand - could call a dozen in 2007. There is always the opportunity to unite, organize a community and translate the classics in the right way.  I would love to participate. <br>  In light of what is happening, the phrase rendered in the epigraph (taken from the site of the "releasers") becomes that snake devouring itself by the tail.  Maybe someone wants the criteria of professionalism to be blurred.  But it seems to me that among many criteria of professionalism the main thing is the interest of the master in the quality of the results of his work.  The master doesn‚Äôt care what label is hung on him - ‚Äúamateur‚Äù, ‚Äúpro‚Äù.  The master can work both at home and in the studio.  But what distinguishes a professional from an amateur is one: an endless striving for perfection in the results of work. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/6e9/7e9/80f/6e97e980f2c5ab9213d06976f97bbfde.jpg" width="406" height="200" hspace="10" vspace="10">  Obviously: if someone doesn‚Äôt care about the result, if he only thinks about how to start cutting cabbage quickly, those who will appreciate the fruits of his activities will sooner or later ask him not to continue.  <strong>"Releases" - please stop, stop this mess.</strong> <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/683/c0d/2bd/683c0d2bd6687c3e7c9242f67d47aea4.jpg" width="407" height="198" hspace="10" vspace="10">  At the end of the film, the girl says in a dignified voice: ‚ÄúThe release has been prepared specifically for the interlude dot ru‚Äù.  Is this pride? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/20750/">https://habr.com/ru/post/20750/</a></p>
