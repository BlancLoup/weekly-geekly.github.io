Of course, these qualities help in the implementation of the project, but do not forget that the majority of startups do not have practice in marketing, creating presentations, communicating with investors or with the team.  They do not know how to hire and motivate employees, how to show the product at their best and where to sacrifice features for convenience.  And this is no less important than the head on the shoulders and the golden hands. <br><br>  I myself create my startup, but the more I immerse myself in this topic, the more I understand that I don‚Äôt know very much and this becomes the cause of erroneous actions.  Therefore, I began to buy packs of books on interesting and useful topics in order to fill gaps in education.  Here I want to share what I read.  At once I will make a reservation that these are opinions about books rather than reviews that you can read for yourself on any book website.

      Some books are directly about startups, others are about marketing, others are about motivation, fourth ones are about self-development.  One way or another, I think that all this should be known to novice entrepreneurs. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>1. Jason Fried</b>  <b>Rework.</b>  <b>Business without prejudice</b> <br>  I think it is not worth talking about this book once again, surely many people are familiar with it.  But if suddenly you did not read this little hooligan business manual from 37 Signals - be sure to do it!  The value of the book is not so much in good advice and wise decisions, but in the inspiration that comes during the reading. <br><br>  5/5 <br><br>  <b>2. Carmine Gallo.</b>  <b>iPresentation.</b>  <b>Lessons of conviction from Apple leader Steve Jobs</b> <br>  What is the secret of the presentations of Steve Jobs, who are sometimes expected more than the product he represents?  They have a special magic, they always listen to what is called "on the edge of the chair."  How to make presentations in the style of Jobs, described in this wonderful and very stylishly designed book.  I read with pleasure.  I think that it is worth reading to everyone, at least in order to learn how to express your thoughts briefly and clearly, discarding everything superfluous. <br><br>  5/5. <br><br>  <b>3. Guy Kawasaki.</b>  <b>Startup</b> <br>  This book is already considered almost a bible for everyone who starts their own business.  Basically, it‚Äôs about positioning your product for a start for yourself, then for investors and finally for consumers.  A lot of useful and most important specific advice, and not just talk about what you need to stand out and have your own character.  It is easy to read, individual tablets and clever thoughts can be printed and hung on the wall. <br><br>  5/5. <br><br>  <b>4. David Kirkpatrick.</b>  <b>Social network</b> <br>  Also a sensational book about creating Facebook.  A hundred times more reliable and more detailed than described in the same film.  It is very useful in that it considers a long period (6 years) of the development of the most famous social network, for which nothing has happened.  And if the film is built on the relationship of the characters, then the book deals directly with Facebook itself, its functions, problems, successes and investments.  You can (and should) reread several times. <br><br>  5/5 <br><br>  <b>5. Seth Godin.</b>  <b>Purple cow</b> <br>  Very cool book, by generated inspiration is similar to Rework.  About the fact that the world of products and advertising is changing, and nowadays it is important to create something so outstanding (like a purple cow) that everyone will tell each other about themselves.  About the fact that it is necessary to preserve individuality, what is better (and financially, too) to have a small army of loyal fans than to make a product for everyone that does not cause any emotions.  And of course advice is given on how to achieve this. <br>  Very good translation, swallowed 170 pages in a couple of days. <br><br>  5/5 <br><br>  <b>6. Lorain Grabs-West.</b>  <b>Employees for life</b> <br>  A small book, only 128 pages, is read in one breath.  About corporate culture in the local American airline Southwest Airlines, in which half of Americans dream to work.  There are a lot of situations that were solved by the company in an unusual way for others, but which left such a mark on the worker‚Äôs soul that he fell in love with his work.  There are many funny stories from workdays.  Of course, it is more suitable for HR and directors, but I was also interested. <br><br>  4/5 <br><br>  <b>7. Tony Shea.</b>  <b>Delivering happiness</b> <br>  The story of the creation of the largest American online store with impeccable service - Zappos.  This book is about content something between the fifth and sixth book.  Half about a startup, half about a corporate culture.  Kruta by the fact that the story is in the first person, the author is the permanent CEO of Zappos.  In general, nothing new, but as another success story is quite interesting. <br><br>  4/5 <br><br>  <b>8. Mark Goulstone.</b>  <b>I hear you right through</b> <br>  Oh, this is a wonderful book!  I was hooked by the fact that the author was the coach of the FBI negotiators.  Well, you know, those brave guys that dissuade suicides from jumping from a skyscraper?  I thought that the book would give advice on how to conduct business negotiations, but it turned out that the topic is much broader and extends from negotiations with business partners to finding a common language with native people.  It is a little amusing that in the examples given after some very correct phrase, the interlocutors suddenly begin to cry, which in the fifth example already causes a skeptical smile, but the value of the book is very high and, I think, it should be read to everyone and more than once. <br><br>  4/5 <br><br>  <b>9. Stephen Covey.</b>  <b>Seven skills of highly effective people</b> <br>  The name of the book is a little scary, you think that it is for white-collar workers who want to become successful managers and consider as suckers those who have not earned a million by the age of 25.  But in fact, everything turns out to be much nicer, the book is written for ordinary people who want to improve their lives.  A lot of life situations are considered and it is clearly explained how and why it is better to do so in them.  If you are an introvert with the desire to make a startup - I strongly advise you, there are useful tips on how to communicate in this cruel, extrovert world. <br><br>  4/5 <br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br>  In conclusion, I will note how I see the benefits of reading such books.  Yes, they are somewhat similar to each other, sometimes the same thoughts are repeated in them (sometimes literally), some books are far from the Russian reality.  But what is difficult to argue with is the fact that such books stimulate brain activity well.  Sometimes some ideas come while reading, sometimes you are tormented by the question of how to solve a problem, and here you have an almost ready solution, and it happens that everything is bad and already completely desperate, but you read and understand that everything went through this, you get up and go to meet your dream with new forces. <br><br>  Good luck to all startups! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/117681/">https://habr.com/ru/post/117681/</a></p>
