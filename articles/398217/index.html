This model will be autonomous, wireless, that is, mounted on the head, not constraining movements.  You can freely walk in all directions or rotate around its axis. <br><br>  New helmet promise to make "affordable."  It will occupy a niche somewhere in the middle between the cheap consumer Gear VR helmet for the Samsung Galaxy and the expensive high-end Oculus Rift, designed for advanced gamers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Prototype Santa Cruz</b>

As seen in the short video with a demonstration of the Oculus VR, the new model is a modified version of the Oculus Rift with a computing module attached on the back of the head.  Positional tracking allows you to accurately position the player in the space of virtual reality.  In the future, this is the most important function for creating integrated augmented reality systems in which the virtual world will be combined with the real one. <br><br>  In principle, position tracking technology is not something revolutionary.  For engineers, it was important to reduce the power consumption of the mobile computer so that it does not instantly kill the battery.  John Carmack, technical director of Oculus VR, spoke enthusiastically about solving this engineering problem. <br><br>  The Oculus VR prototype is still in its early stages of development, said Mark Zuckerberg.  What the ‚Äúaccessibility‚Äù of a future product means is not entirely clear, but this word was said in a speech by Zuckerberg. <br><br>  Fans suggest that a virtual reality helmet would be well reduced by about half: to about 300 dollars, then this thing will become really massive, people wearing VR helmets will appear in public transport and on the street. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/526/b45/a3a/526b45a3a4404ac785e3c8664db81163.jpg"><br>  <i>Mark Zuckerberg walks around the office and communicates with avatars of other people from his social network;</i>  <i>they control their facial expressions with the buttons on the controller</i> <br><br>  During his speech, Mark Zuckerberg showed how he walks in his helmet around the office and calls his wife via video link without removing the helmet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/490/ce8/c76/490ce8c76d924c55a08c1c25a26e119d.jpg"><br>  <i>Mark calls his wife via video call without removing his helmet</i> <br><br>  Some people find it unpleasant that the promising Oculus VR technology, born as a national Kickstarter project, is now in the hands of Mark Zuckerberg.  But nothing can be done - this is the life and realities of modern business.  In 2014, the owners of the social network bought out the startup Oculus VR for $ 2 billion in cash and Facebook shares. <br><br>  Now virtual reality helmets are connected to Facebook servers.  All games are installed online without the possibility of an offline procedure, hardware DRM checking is working. <br><br><h3>  Oculus Touch Controller </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7fa/35e/e29/7fa35ee2981b4433aaf0ffcc4fbd5235.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to the Oculus VR helmet, Mark Zuckerberg introduced the Oculus Touch motion controllers.  This is a finished product, sales of which begin on December 6, 2016 (pre-orders are accepted from October 10). <br><br>  With interactive motion controllers, the Oculus Rift helmet transforms from a passive external surveillance device into a real interactive gaming system for interacting with the virtual world.  This is something that was not enough for a full game.  Now the player can normally control the hands of the game character: swinging a sword, beating with a fist or a knife, lifting objects from the ground, throwing the ball. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c1f/0e2/b09/c1f0e2b09d404f7c8a15ffc047d4a022.jpg"><br><br>  Even basic gestures are available, such as pointing a hand at an object. <br><br><div class="oembed"><twitter-widget class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" id="twitter-widget-0" style="position: absolute; visibility: hidden; display: block; transform: rotate(0deg); width: 500px; margin: 10px auto; max-width: 100%; min-width: 220px;"></twitter-widget><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center" data-twitter-extracted-i1551423222658130946="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">  "Touch is $ 199, and starts shipping December 6th!"  Tune in to the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OC3%3Fsrc%3Dhash"># OC3</a> livestream: <a href="https://t.co/coMFPh8Bms">https://t.co/coMFPh8Bms</a> <a href="https://t.co/mJ2pcevAfs">pic.twitter.com/mJ2pcevAfs</a> </p>  - Oculus (@oculus) <a href="https://twitter.com/oculus/status/784091196951924736">October 6, 2016</a> </blockquote><script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br>  Oculus Touch controllers are made in a stylish plastic case in the form of a ring.  Apparently, such an execution has no functional purpose, but is done solely for the sake of balance.  All buttons and mini-joysticks are located in the center under the player‚Äôs fingers.  In general, such controllers seem more convenient and useful than Xbox One wireless gamepads. <br><br>  On each hand gadgets are attached with ropes to the wrists, so as not to drop them in the heat of the game. <br><br>  Two Oculus Touch controllers cost $ 200.  These devices raise the cost of the Oculus Rift from $ 600 to $ 800.  For comparison, the HTC Vive with controllers in the form of wands or "sticks" costs the same $ 800. <br><br>  Each controller has its own positioning device.  True, for high precision positioning of the controllers in the room you will need to buy a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016/10/06/an-extra-79-turns-the-oculus-into-a-room-scale-vr-system/">third sensor</a> for an additional $ 80.  With its help, a 3D map of the room.  This is so that during the game you do not crash into the wall and fall off the balcony. <br><br>  On the market, these helmets will have to compete with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016/10/05/sony-playstation-vr-review/">PlayStation VR</a> virtual reality system, which goes on sale next week for $ 400.  But this is only the price of the helmet, excluding the cost of the camera and the Move motion controllers. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CCYuSfNhFPU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>  <i>Batman: Arkham VR - one of the main new games for PlayStation VR</i> <br><br>  Virtual reality is becoming more accessible, and games - more realistic.  What else does a geek need to be happy?  And not only geek.  In his speech, Mark Zuckerbreg told how he demonstrated virtual reality to <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/10/6/13178188/oculus-connect-3-vr-facebook-mark-zuckerberg">presidents and prime ministers of different countries</a> (depending on mentality and culture, the president was launched a first-person shooter or led on a tour of natural beauty in virtual reality).  According to the hacker, all world leaders were fascinated and captured by technology.  One of them even missed his plane, not wanting to remove the helmet of virtual reality.  He demanded to show the promised dinosaur. <br><br><h3>  Other news from Oculus VR </h3><br>  In addition to the Oculus Touch controllers, the Oculus Earphones headphones will also be available for sale during this Christmas season, which can be used instead of standard headphones in a helmet.  Cost $ 50.  Headphones are sold at the same time as the controller: pre-orders are accepted from October 10, delivery after December 6. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/283/cc4/2a3/283cc42a38d34367a4074e712946d22c.jpg"><br><br>  Apparently, this gadget will be the perfect Christmas gift for the geek and the Oculus Rift fan, who already has everything, and naturally, he did not buy separate headphones, because he does not need them. <br><br>  The company also announced a reduction in the minimum technical requirements for a computer to connect the Oculus Rift.  Previously, the minimum required PC with a graphics accelerator minimum Nvidia GTX 970 (or equivalent) and a minimum processor Intel Core i5-4590.  Now, thanks to the Oculus API's frame rate optimization software, the PC requirements are reduced to the Nvidia 960 and the Intel Core i3-6100 (or AMD FX4350). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/398217/">https://habr.com/ru/post/398217/</a></p>
