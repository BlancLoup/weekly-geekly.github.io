  <section class="page js-page"><h1>We have long hands: 7 foreign sites where you can find remote work</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The development of telecommunication technologies is a win-win for employers and employees: companies can find talents around the world, and people can work from anywhere, just to have Wi-Fi.  And the popularity of remote work is only growing.  For example, <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/184649/telecommuting-work-climbs.aspx">according to a Gallup report</a> , in 2015, 37% of respondents answered that they work remotely in part or the whole working day.  This was 7 percentage points more than in 2008. And there is no reason to believe that this trend has changed today. <br><br>  The more people turn to a part-time job, freelance or remote full-time work, the more often the question arises: where exactly will I find a job that will allow me to refuse to go to the office?  We offer you seven foreign sites where you can find remote work. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Jobspresso</font> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/f53/8cb/6e5/f538cb6e52b344039545a1419c6e3510.png">

      <a href="https://jobspresso.co/">Jobspresso</a> specializes in remote job openings - you will not find ‚Äúclassic‚Äù jobs here - and the set of offers covers any industry that allows work at home.  This includes design, marketing, IT and more.  In fact, if you can do some work remotely, then Jobspresso will probably have suitable jobs.  Although the site contains a lot of industries, but the majority of proposals relate to technical professions: engineers, developers, QA-analytics and support service specialists. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Powertoofly</font> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/d4d/fa4/e48/d4dfa4e4879e4705b62a7325d875dbf6.png"><br><br>  <a href="https://powertofly.com/">PowerToFly</a> is a job site with a specific mission: to help women get back to work after a long break.  PowerToFly not only contains a base of vacancies, but also tries to help reduce the time for finding a job by comparing employer companies with the appropriate candidates.  The registration process is not the easiest, because all candidates are checked during registration, but as soon as you are approved, you can immediately begin negotiations with companies.  After agreeing, you have 2-4 weeks of the test period, during which you will be able to understand whether this job is right for you before officially registering.  And during this time you will be paid. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">RemoteOK</font> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/718/8bf/c72/7188bfc721ae454abdfe98ee18cdf066.png"><br><br>  <a href="https://remoteok.io/">RemoteOK</a> is another niche job site.  There are open job listings for developers, engineers, programmers, data analysts, and so on.  The site is no frills, that is, it is easy to navigate: there is only what is needed for job search.  Minimalism extends here to all operations: you do not need to register or fill out a resume, hoping that it gets in the eyes of the right people.  Instead, you will be asked to send resumes to specific postal addresses, or redirect to the company's website. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Weworkremotely</font> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e99/bd9/f22/e99bd9f22b4044efaffce5144c004eb0.png"><br><br>  <a href="https://weworkremotely.com/">This site was</a> not designed specifically for the needs of the technical industry, but it has a huge number of remote vacancies for techies.  Navigation is simple, user-friendly interface.  There are vacancies not only remote, but also ‚Äúclassic‚Äù in all kinds of industries;  Various filters are available, including contractual, freelance, full-time, part-time, temporary work, positions for trainees. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Stack overflow</font> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/afe/1db/8a3/afe1db8a303e4c59a72bb90b99442edd.png"><br><br>  It is unlikely that you need to tell that there is such a site.  <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> is the mocking name of the Stack Exchanges programming community.  In essence, this is a question / answer site where IT professionals meet and exchange knowledge and experience.  But not only: there are job listings here.  Mainly for programmers.  The interface makes it easy to filter deleted jobs.  You can also customize your own recommendations to receive notifications of vacancies that meet your criteria. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Idealist</font> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/257/814/1ee/2578141eeaa34efb8b49280e9205fdff.png"><br><br>  For people who want to find a deeper meaning in their daily work, <a href="https://www.idealist.org/en/%3FremoteOk%3DYES%26sort%3Drelevance%26type%3DJOB">Idealist</a> promises vacancies that provide "opportunities to act."  It offers a variety of filters that help you find the right job - including the filter ‚Äúonly remote positions‚Äù.  Here are published the vacancies of companies that help others and declare strong missions of their activities.  This platform allows you to combine your love for others with technical skills. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Dribble jobs</font> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/057/694/81f/05769481fd004dc8a84d0afd6ad9f78d.png"><br><br>  And the last site in our collection.  <a href="https://dribbble.com/jobs">Dribble Jobs is</a> focused on remote work for designers: graphic, UX, UI, grocery, web designers and frontend designers.  Here is an impressive list of very serious companies that previously published their vacancies, including Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon, Yelp and Tumblr.  So if you are interested in finding a job in one of the industry leaders, then Dribble Jobs is a great place to start. <br><br>  <b>ZY</b>  If you actively use other resources, do not hesitate to tell about them in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/334486/">https://habr.com/ru/post/334486/</a></p>
