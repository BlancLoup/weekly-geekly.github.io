      June 15, 1961 - a flight in the courtyard of the Pentagon in front of three thousand members of the military department, who watched with delight as Harold Graham flew through a passenger car. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>‚ÄúYou know, in the films they show there how they fly, they say something abstract, but to be honest, the moment you get off the ground, you think:‚Äú OK, I have a maximum of 21 seconds, and I really want so that my kids (shows down) get to the ground, "in 15 seconds."</i> <br>  - Harold Graham </blockquote><br>  On October 11, 1961, Graham took part in a demonstration maneuver at the Fort Bragg base, which was attended by President John F. Kennedy.  The pilot started from the amphibious landing, located at a distance from the coast, flew over the water and successfully landed on the shore, next to the president and his delegation.  They say the president opened his mouth in surprise ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Demonstration in Fort Eustis </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VWwWnFpeoBc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h3>  Pentagon Demonstration </h3><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f65/87c/818/f6587c818856ed11e1daea651349c699.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NIKQVMCdddM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h3>  Demonstration in Fort Bragg </h3><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/342/91e/a27/34291ea27fd0faa512e936cdac34ff53.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  ‚ÄúIn October 1961, Graham held his biggest demonstration, which was perpetuated in Life magazine in the form of four photographs.  At Fort Bragg, North Carolina, Graham was standing on a massive amphibian that swept across Lake McKellar.  The bow of the ship cut through the cold water, surrounded by dark incense pine, oak and the striated bark of sweet currants.  As he settled on a sandbank, about 200 feet from the coast, Graham hit the gas.  His boots had come off the deck of the amphibian. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a82/7d9/d7c/a827d9d7c7887bed0ebf721207c60776.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  A haze of fog enveloped him as the wave of the jet pack stirred the lake.  He flew at a distance of several feet above the water to the shore, overcoming the distance in seconds.  He landed perfectly, as if he was just walking and, sweeping along the sandy embankment, abruptly turned right and walked about 20 feet.  Then he abruptly changed course, clicked his heels and already welcomed the person sitting next to him - President John F. Kennedy.  "Buffalo's Evening News" quoted an army officer who said that when Graham landed, the commander-in-chief's eyes were as wide and surprised as children usually have. "[ <a href="https://www.nashvillescene.com/news/article/13019405/hero-pilot-hal-graham146s-hard-fall-to-earth">Source</a> ] <br><br>  In another source: ‚Äú... wide eyed and open mouthed, just like a kid‚Äù.

The maximum duration of the flight of the rocket pack was 21 seconds, with a range of 120 meters.  At the same time the knapsack was accompanied by a whole team of service personnel.  In one twenty-second flight, up to 5 gallons (19 liters) of deficient hydrogen peroxide was consumed.  According to the military, the Bell Rocket Belt was a spectacular toy rather than an efficient vehicle.  Army expenditures under the contract with Bell Aerosystems amounted to $ 150,000, Bell also spent another $ 50,000.  The military refused the further financing of the SRLD program, the contract was terminated. <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúA new star is burning in the sky.</i>  <i>It was lit, of course, by hooligans. ‚Äù(Valentin Gaft)</i> <br><br><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/57f/984/633/57f9846339bd170a055d32d473694f01.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  You can follow how we are doing the first Russian turbojet of vertical take-off here: <br><br>  - <a href="https://habr.com/company/jethackers/">blog on Habr√©</a> <br>  - <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/DfCan0x_SUQt9UNLfJ_s_Q">Telegram channel</a> <br>  - <a href="https://vk.com/jethackers">VK group</a> <br>  - <a href="https://www.facebook.com/stcnk">my Fb profile</a> <br>  - letters to write here alexey.stacenko@gmail.com <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Video of our turbojet snowboard</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Swms2jrtz9I" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <i>Vidos with <a href="https://habr.com/article/414091/">Habrakorporativa</a> .</i> <br></div></div><br><h3>  PS </h3><br>  By the way, the company <a href="https://habr.com/company/ruvds/">RUVDS</a> became interested in jetpack and helps to storm the clouds. <br><br>  Bonus blog readers: <br><br> <a href="https://ruvds.com/ru-rub/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/28/6b/cx/286bcxeewpe_f6saatmi-r3v224.jpeg" alt="image"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/425581/">https://habr.com/ru/post/425581/</a></p>
