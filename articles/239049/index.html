Requests came from all over the country - St. Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Krasnodar, Rostov-on-Don, Perm, Khabarovsk, Sochi, and so on.  Even business was not limited to the country - people from Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan also wanted to open the Madrobots shop.  But the franchise is first of all debugged processes.  How could we explain how to open stores in other cities, if they themselves didn‚Äôt really know how? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4f7/a67/910/4f7a679105344d788d45d3a166a503b1.jpg"><br>  We decided to open our store in a large shopping center, and are now ready to tell you about the problems, jambs, processes, solutions and conclusions.  Come in, under the cut interesting. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><hr>  Date: <b>May 26</b>  <b>94 days to open</b> <br>  Location: Madrobots Office <br><blockquote>  - Well, we opened a store on the top crust, great.  But he is alone.  And if you need another 100 open, what would you do? <br>  - I would hang myself. </blockquote><br>  The very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe possibility of opening a store in a large shopping center came to us after the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/balrobotov/blog/223359/">Ball of Robots</a> .  We didn‚Äôt really pin our hopes on our stand there, but after a few months, we saw that there were still sales there.  We realized that you can sell our products without advertising, without the Internet - people just walked by, some stopped and bought.  Just due to the flow of people, without any effort, we sold. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/644/ab0/166/644ab0166e4c49f5918b1198b4c2ca8e.png"><br>  For the entire existence of the robots ball, we earned 200 thousand rubles.  This is before taxes (in our case, 15% from the difference between income and expenses) and payment processing of bank cards (on average ~ 3% per transaction). <br>  Not very much, but nevertheless, it was live sales and cash.  And we decided to transfer this experience to another platform - to some shopping center with high traffic. <br><br>  To begin with, as marketers, we opened <a href="http://www.4sqstat.com/moscow">Foursquare</a> and selected the places with the highest attendance.  As we reasoned: our customers are advanced and use services such as 4SQ.  There, where most of all chekinov - more and our clients. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ddb/fd1/d73/ddbfd1d730d74d458a5007757252d5e7.png"><br>  We selected the most popular shopping centers, and our employee began systematic attempts to get into the rental departments of these centers in order to learn about the conditions.  We were answered from MEGA. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/275/383/b00/275383b003934979963110f7863f53fa.png"><br>  And wrap it all up ...

    <hr>  Date: <b>June 16th.</b>  <b>73 days before opening</b> <br>  Location: Madrobots Office <br>  We contacted the rental department and set about choosing a place and discussing the rental price.  We even managed to knock out a small discount for the first couple of months. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c51/395/948/c513959483284673a570ce0971d60152.png"><br>  At the same time, we thought about the store project, made the first versions of design and visualization, and looked for a company that could make the equipment quickly and efficiently (haha).  As it turned out, everything is not so simple - even before signing the contract, the Ikea rental department (yes, all mega buildings belong to Ikea) gave us a whole guideline, according to which we had to draft a future kiosk to ‚Äúprotect‚Äù it before the rental department.  And only if everything suits them, they will give us a go-ahead for signing. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/14f/425/902/14f425902b9748abb007c03604986f42.jpg"><br>  This document regulates quite a lot of things - from kiosk materials to the appearance of signs. <br>  <b>[Removed by censorship]</b> <br>  We draw preliminary layout on show-windows.  After we looked at the other kiosks in mega and other shopping centers, we decided to make a so-called island - a kiosk in which the seller is located inside the perimeter of racks or shop windows.  The original version looked like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c01/2a0/f7f/c012a0f7f71d471d8233821045f27527.jpg"><br>  Little by little, it became overgrown with meat, we pondered and refined the options for windows for convenient location of goods, the lighting system, drives for storing gadgets, stands, price tags, logos and design elements, wiring, cash registers and so on.  Little by little our islet got more and more complete and real look: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/118/e60/dbf/118e60dbf24f4edf8ef499aed8a52658.jpg"><br><br><hr>  Date: <b>June 27th.</b>  <b>62 days to open</b> <br>  Place: Office of Furniture for Business <br>  After some time, the project of our store received approval, and we were faced with a no less difficult task. <br>  <b>[Removed by censorship]</b> <br>  We had to find a company that could produce and assemble a kiosk for this project.  And this is not very expensive, besides. <br>  Of course, we screwed up.  We chose Furniture for Business (bzmb.ru - I do not recommend irresponsible dolboklyi), which, judging by the portfolio, had a lot of experience in creating exactly such racks and kiosks.  Managers (as it turned out, only before concluding a contract) are polite and active, give advice and come up with ideas.  It would seem that all is well.  We made the TZ, signed the contract, paid the advance and waited for the end of production. <br><br><hr>  Date: <b>July 20th.</b>  <b>39 days to open</b> <br>  Location: Mega Belaya Dacha <br>  While the drawing of the island was being developed and its production, we took up the choice of a place in the mega.  We were offered several possible options, where the stand space was empty, and we went there to look at them live and measure the number of people passing in that place. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3ad/1b7/b38/3ad1b7b38c464e2abbf73ed06384d8a7.jpg"><br>  This is the number of people who passed me in half an hour.  On weekends there are twice as many people.  You can simply count: 477 * 2 * 24 * (5 + 2 * 2) = 206 thousand visitors per week. <br>  It turned out that the number of people in these places is almost the same, and we chose only by what place we like more.  In the end, chose: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/df6/555/f66/df6555f661f3429c887968286904aea1.jpg"><br>  Nearby was the anchor tenant mediamarkt, which in our opinion should have generated us more or less targeted traffic consisting of people who want to buy electronics. <br>  Anchor tenant is a big store that attracts a lot of human traffic.  Very few people go to shopping centers just like that.  The main traffic attracts large and recognizable stores such as Auchan, Ikea, Ob, Mediamarkt, Crossroads, and so on.  They are the anchor tenants. <br>  Sometimes they can act in the building owner himself, as Ikea, who owns the Mega shopping center building. <br>  Anchor tenant, as a rule, rents a large area and pays for it at a fairly low rate (or even does not pay at all, it depends on the size of the shopping center and renter‚Äôs fame), instead giving its brand, reputation, and providing the shopping center with a stream of people .  They also spend money - providing advertising in the media itself and at the same time throughout the shopping center. <br>  All other small shops, in fact, ‚Äúparasitize‚Äù on this stream - their own traffic to them, though not zero, but small, especially if the shopping center is located on the outskirts or outside the city. <br><br><hr>  Date: <b>July 30th.</b>  <b>29 days before opening</b> <br>  Location: Madrobots Office.  Project "Undercover Spy" <br>  So, we had a lease agreement, we had a place, we almost had an island itself, we had ready goods and little sales experience.  But we were sorely lacking system knowledge about how to sell - we suspected that the experience of the top will not match the store with a lot of traffic and an order of magnitude more purchases. <br>  In order to quickly learn how to build a sales process, logistics, employee training and store management, we decided on industrial espionage - we sent our trainee to a competitor company with the task of ingesting confidence and bringing more business secrets. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e76/daa/a49/e76daaa4943f4ff2b79d1dd37f13f29e.jpg"><br>  We did not choose the company for very long, and as a result, it became a kind of ‚ÄúInternet-based electronics store Mbar‚Äù (mbar.ru, I recommend, they make 8 thousand rubles a day only on films on the screen).  If any of them read it, hello to you!  :) <br>  They had a significant advantage - a large number of the same small pavilions and islets, which we were going to open. <br>  Our man successfully penetrated into the company, settled in there, drank beer with vendors and supervisors, bought himself a posting for the phone at cost, completed a trainee training course and brought us the Knowledge: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/744/fc8/bbe/744fc8bbe5ff4d739b0b802c2c7a91de.png"><br>  Not to say that it was very useful for us, but at least it was interesting. <br><br><hr>  Date: <b>August 11th.</b>  <b>17 days to open</b> <br>  Location: Gorbushka.  OBI <br>  By tradition, I went to OBI to buy an electrician.  But it was enough for my requests to go beyond the limits of ‚Äúwire, terminals, electrical tape,‚Äù as I understood that this is not the best place for such purchases.  When asked to bring me the sleeves and a snap for them, the seller happily dragged the packaging of NShVI tips and ... pliers.  Great, I thought, and bought only wire and sockets.  By the way, they also did not have carts: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a7f/20e/444/a7f20e444bf543819e320ea474866030.jpg"><br>  It became clear that we must either change the store, or say goodbye to the desire to make everything cool.  And I sat down to search for the store. <br>  At first I, like a true geek, found several online stores.  Several - because one sold the tool that I needed, but did not sell the sleeves, the second sold different sleeves and tips, and the third - automatic machines, boxes and cable channels. <br>  That's after the order and started some garbage.  The first store asked for passport information in order to make a payment through Sberbank.  When I wanted to pay it, I noticed a suspiciously small amount - it turned out that half of what I wanted to buy is not in the order.  This wonderful trick with ears is called ‚Äúwe bill for availability‚Äù.  Notifying me of a change in order, or worse, keeping up-to-date information on the site is not at all necessary.  The second store was better - immediately after ordering, they confessed that they didn‚Äôt have half the product range from the site, and offered to pay now, and they would definitely bring everything in a week or two.  The third store simply did not respond to the order, except by automatic mail, and only 5 days later they wrote me a request to write a phone for ... ‚Äúfaster ordering‚Äù. <br>  This was the last straw and I decided to go the opposite way - to find a store with the simplest site, hoping that they would compensate for the simplicity of the site with a good office.  And did not lose. <br><br><hr>  Date: <b>August 17th.</b>  <b>11 days before opening</b> <br>  Location: Shop Electrical <br>  I found a wonderful electrical installation store (electro-mpo.ru, I recommend), which still has a price list in the form of an Excel file, but which, on the other hand, has as many as 11 stores in Moscow, which you can easily enter and touch almost the entire range of hands: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/42a/407/47c/42a40747c70f4c79bc336723b979495c.jpg"><br>  If someone wants to see photos of what is on the shop windows, I took some photos with a description - you can see them <a href="https://vk.com/wall1319143_2716">here</a> (by the way, <a href="https://vk.com/vvzvlad">subscribe</a> ). <br>  The process of buying it is not easy (more complicated than in the supermarket, yes), but it is convenient and technological.  Using your eyes and hands, you select, feel, measure with a ruler, micrometer and calipers the piece you need, write down the number pasted under it, use the terminal to find out the price and balance in stock (as well as specifications and possible replacements if in stock it will not be), then say this number to a specially trained aunt, and pay the invoice issued.  After that, it remains only to wait until the warehouse collects and gives you your order: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/134/04e/520/13404e520812f023f3aedbf6febcea6e.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Convenient and fast. <br><br><hr>  Date: <b>August 26</b>  <b>2 days before opening</b> <br>  Location: Madrobots Office <br>  It took a couple of days to figure out what we bought and how to use it all.  Another two days - for jogging to the store and back, because at one time to buy everything and immediately unrealistic - just like with a drink, it‚Äôs still two times to run. <br>  This time I decided to do hardcore and for ages so that I no longer blamed the thin wires in the comments (in response to those commentators, I can say that the pavilion on the hump works until it burns out with the whole building, the wiring does not stink, does not spark and is heated).  For the main wiring, it is a thick copper mono-core wire with a 4mm section, for connecting individual outlets - multicore by 2.5mm.  Power cable connections - by sleeves (in accordance with its own <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/157947/">article</a> ).  Stranded cable connectors - only with NShVI.  Everywhere a three-wire cable is used in accordance with TN-CS, the benefit of an electrician assured us that all the wiring is done that way, and even stand an tie to each outlet in the building.  Naturally, my inner paranoid did not believe him (and that, the shield was never shown to me), and along with my automatic machine I also installed a local RCD too. <br>  I gathered all this in a small case on 4 cases in advance, so as not to do it in a hurry (in the photo it is in the corner). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/da5/b5f/192/da5b5f1925a84e02a289e65b5d94df90.jpg"><br>  We check everything again.  It seems ready.  You can go home and have a good sleep. <br><br><hr>  Date: <b>August 27th.</b>  <b>15 hours before opening</b> <br>  Location: Madrobots Office <br>  It's time to go.  We sit in the car.  Yandex navigator, route, where: Mega Belaya Dacha.  1 hour 10 minutes.  Great, let's go! <br>  In 40 minutes: <br>  - Wait, where are we going? <br>  - In mega, where else? <br>  - What a mega, we have 15 boxes on the top crust!  And we are at the other end of the city! <br>  - AAAAA! <br>  - AAAAAA! <br>  Rebuild the route. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7f8/15b/036/7f815b03688343b4a3ea7d627a0a7593.jpg"><br>  Eye fake!  We do not have time either to the warehouse or to the mega by the arrival of movers with an island. <br>  Half an hour later, the call from the warehouse on the top crust: <br>  - Guys, and how much will you be?  I'm going to a friend for my birthday, I'm leaving in half an hour.  How long will you go there, 10 minutes?  20? <br>  - Uh, Sasha, how can I tell you ... In general, you probably will have time to blowing out the candles on the cake. <br><br><hr>  Date: <b>August 27th.</b>  <b>13 hours before opening</b> <br>  Location: Gorbushkin Yard, Madrobots Store Depot <br>  Two hours later, as the navigator predicted, we still arrive at the warehouse and in almost complete darkness begin to load the boxes.  Boxes do not fit. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d8b/dd5/255/d8bdd52552f547329da46419752baa93.jpg"><br>  Understand what will be useful to us on the first day, and what can be left in stock is no longer time - the installers will arrive soon, and we have permission to unload and work. <br>  Finally, I managed to push most of the boxes into the car, but at what price! <br><br>  "- Vlad, there is no room left for you. Call a taxi and drive it. Well, at the same time, seize these two boxes." <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/961/210/f60/961210f60d0b4039b0ed6132d121556f.jpg"><br>  Calling a taxi.  Taxi rides.  Long.  It's cold outside.  I want to be warm and in the toilet.  But you can not move away from the boxes - according to rough estimates there are gadgets for about 200k.  To take them somewhere is also unrealistic - I lift one box with both hands and can put a taxi in the trunk.  No more. <br>  Taxi!  I have never been so happy taxi driver.  I try to get a piece of paper with an address and a map to the unloading zone with frozen hands, but it does not work.  Masha hand - go too somewhere. <br><br><hr>  Date: <b>August 27th.</b>  <b>10 hours and 40 minutes before opening</b> <br>  Location: Underground parking Mega Belaya Dacha.  Unloading area <br>  We park in the unloading area, the guards look weird.  It turns out that we got up under the garbage container, which hangs on chains, and it will now be lowered.  We move to another place. <br>  We approach the dude at unloading, show the documents, ask what to do. <br>  "‚ÄîAnd do I know?"  Leaves.  We catch up, ask who to find out. <br>  "‚ÄîThe second shift will come, ask him."  Makes an attempt to leave. <br>  "- And when will he come? ‚ÄîAnd # $% knows" He leaves finally. <br>  The girl from the rental department is not responding.  We are at a loss.  The furniture makers are saving - they call and report that they dropped the corner bedside table when packing and now they will redo it, for the sake of which they started part of the production in half of the first night.  We leave from the unloading area to the underground parking. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c39/6c9/41d/c396c941d5f147569d536207acfc11a1.jpg"><br>  Let go of the taxi.  Now, in the underground parking there is a car in which the boxes are even in the driver's seat, so there is not even the possibility to overtake it to another place. <br>  We come and look at the place of our future island: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4d3/e8a/b17/4d3e8ab176fc4d229161b25eddd68836.jpg"><br>  The gray box on the floor is the socket into which we will later turn on. <br><br><hr>  Date: <b>August 28.</b>  <b>9 hours 30 minutes before opening</b> <br>  Location: Mega Belaya Dacha, McDonalds on the second floor <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bc7/2c3/a90/bc72c3a90df34713856f951189095baa.jpg"></a> <br>  Night mega is fun.  There are practically no empty spaces (there are 900 people per hour in the afternoon, twice as much in the evening, four in the evening on weekends), Tajiks dissect them on loaders and floor polishers.  The quiet mat supervisors in shoe and clothing stores - they need to deposit 5 boxes of things for the night, each of which is per person. <br>  We sit on the couch already closed McDonald's.  Strange guards go and look, but so far they do nothing.  In general, the strangest and most inadequate people are selected by the guards.  I suspect already at the interview. <br>  ‚ÄúHmm, ok, army, rocking, weapon license.‚Äù  It seems all is well, the last question.  Are you weird and inadequate? <br>  - Naturally, here is help! <br>  - Great, you come to us! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2df/83f/3df/2df83f3df9254c00a2eb30add4b86a25.jpg"><br>  Coming out of the movie confidently go to the closed poppy - there is a toilet inside the back streets.  It's dark there too, but apparently they know what they are doing. <br>  The dude goes from the toilet and accidentally falls on the edge of the frame. <br>  "- Say, are you shooting me ?!"  I am laughing out loud.  He climbs with fists, trying to punish me, I show him a photo, where only part of the arm of his royal person is imprinted, he calms down.  Leave suspiciously at each other. <br><br>  Time: <b>8 hours before opening</b> <br>  Location: Sofa in McDonalds on the second floor <br>  It took an hour and a half.  Furniture makers do not call.  Got a laptop and phone, I sit, I write an article.  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/fundorin/" class="user_link">The fundorin</a> lies on the sofa and seems to be asleep. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/93c/83f/f54/93c83ff54c1d4618a254185b99d395dd.jpg"><br><br>  Time: <b>7 hours 10 minutes before opening</b> <br>  Location: Undefined <br>  The <s>forester</s> came guard and drove us out of the McDonald.

Let's go look for a new place. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/03d/7e1/486/03d7e14860f04cbc81b6bdfe897e46ee.jpg"><br>  Found a sofa in the entertainment complex, went to bed.  Sofa did not take a picture, I wanted to sleep very much. <br><br>  Time: <b>5 hours 45 minutes before opening</b> <br>  Location: comfortable sofa <br>  Woke up.  The furniture makers are calling, they almost arrived.  We run to the unloading area, wake up on the road.

We simply went to the site of the shopping center, wrote to the mail of the rental department, or called to ask for this mail. Sent your presentation and waited for the reaction. </font></font><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/29a/da4/fe9/29ada4fe901047ce8e6daaee1dbfce60.png"><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So it does not work. It is necessary to write in large letters and hang somewhere higher, so as not to forget.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The rental market for retail space is the seller‚Äôs market, not the buyer‚Äôs. Here, shopping centers choose those who will stand in them. But this is half the trouble. The real problem lies in the fact that relations in this market are not business, but personal - relations decide everything. And not even those ‚Äúconnections‚Äù that are usually, but practically everyday ones - without friends of acquaintances from relatives of someone you know from the rental department or a neighbor in the shopping center, you will simply be put into the folder ‚ÄúWaiting for free space‚Äù, where 20 of the same losers are. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Why did we even end up in a mega? No, not because we were lucky and we hit someone with our presentations. U </font></font><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/ni404/" class="user_link"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">ni404</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">there was an acquaintance who has an acquaintance who worked in the mega before she went on maternity leave. She introduced us to her former colleague, with the help of which the matter got off the ground - our presentation was immediately watched, admired, the questionnaire and contract immediately materialized, and everything went and went. Without this, we would probably still choose a shopping center and wait for offers. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In fact, despite the shopping center sign, we did not choose from 15 options, we chose from one option - the only shopping center that agreed to take us. This was a big mistake - we dropped all the options, grabbing the first one.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We had the experience of Gorbushka, a shop that works in conditions ... well, if not the lack of traffic, then at least a very small stream of people. In fact, this is a showroom for those who want to rotate the gadget in their hands before buying, for those who do not want to buy over the Internet, or for those who want to pick up an order without waiting for the courier. People who buy something there, do not come from the crust, but from us - they go to our store, because they know that we are there. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We wanted to test the reverse model - when people buy simply because we are in a passable place. Such a model has proven to be viable at the Ball of Robots.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We even prepared a business plan for ourselves, in which, based on the ratio (passing people / buying people) taken from the BR, we calculated how many people will pass by us and how many will buy from us at least something. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Our plan went to pieces in the first week. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We counted on 8 purchases / day on weekdays, and 15 on weekends.</font></font> Nothing like this.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The bitter truth was that no one buys anything on weekdays. On weekdays, people come for groceries, come in the evening to have fun, go with the children like in a museum, measure things, eat at the food court. But do not buy. Instead of our 8 purchases, the islet did with a grief in half 2-3. At the weekend it was better, but not much - 7 instead of 15. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is several times less than what we expected. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The monthly cost of maintaining the island is 340 thousand rubles. In order to pay for it, we need to sell at least two to three times more than we sell now. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Why did this not happen, although the calculation was confirmed by the robots ball?</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I have a possible explanation - a different audience. Still, people who wanted to see high-tech pieces and robots walked to the robots ball, and people who wanted to buy clothes and a fan were going to Mega. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Another explanation suggested by a friend from Dadget (dadget.ru): </font></font><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bff/869/7e1/bff8697e148340fea8fc43870215dcc4.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Another problem lies in the very location of the shopping center. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Mega is very far away - the round trip takes at least 4 hours, which simply fall out of life. You can not afford to spend this time every day, if you are not a seller in the island. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We were all limited by this factor, and could not often go there for control and management. Remote control does not always work. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Do I want to say that MEGA is a black spot and nothing is sold there?</font></font> Of course not.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is unlikely that everyone who lives there is unprofitable. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But for a small company that sells gadgets, this is definitely not the best option.</font></font><br><br><h5><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Poor selection of contractors </font></font></font></font><br></h5><script type="text/javascript">function gtElInit() {var lib = new google.translate.TranslateService();lib.translatePage('ru', 'en', function () {});}</script><script type="text/javascript" src="https://translate.google.com/translate_a/element.js?cb=gtElInit&amp;client=wt"></script> Another mistake that we made and for which we paid a headache - a poor choice of contractors.  We made the same mistake as with the choice of a shopping center - we grabbed the first option that suited us without spending a little more time looking at other options, and even worse, not specifying all the advantages and disadvantages of the selected option. <br>  For example, we would have saved calls from former customers of this company from problems with poor-quality furniture in order to ask how their furniture is doing and if there were any problems with the installation.  However, we did not. <br>  But we can do another thing - to warn those who might stumble upon our rake. <br>  Do not mess with Furniture for Business, they are Balance LLC, ORGN 1047796422090, TIN 7729508525. They are Atlant LLC.  Their sites: bar5.ru and bzmb.ru. <br>  They delay production, problems arise during assembly, after assembly, shoals are found, but managers quickly lose all interest in correcting them immediately after paying the balance of money.  For example, a month later (!) After opening the list of problems was still like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bdd/8e2/1bc/bdd8e21bca8e4c29a8a5a6312e51f4f5.png"><br>  And so far some of them have not been so corrected.  And in October, the boxes of the logo began <a href="">to crumble</a> .  Of course, we repaired them on our own, but the sediment remained. <br><br>  The first post about how we decided to open a store in the shopping center MEGA read the link: <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/madrobots/blog/233625/">habrahabr.ru/company/madrobots/blog/233625</a> <br><br>  We also launched a small special project - we are playing out 500 packs of Seeberger nuts among those who share the page <a href="http://madrobots.ru/new_year">madrobots.ru/new_year</a> with their friends.  Come in, choose presents, read interesting facts about nuts and share a page. <br><br> <a href="https://twitter.com/MadrobotsRu"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ac1/fc6/d2a/ac1fc6d2a19948c59791b0da6ab659df.gif"></a> <a href="http://vk.com/madrobots"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/933/ac3/0b6/933ac30b6fd24ffd82218148c2fb0917.gif"></a> <a href="http://instagram.com/madrobotsru"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/464/a82/e04/464a82e045a34bae81406fd0b640cf08.gif"></a> <a href="http://facebook.com/madrobotsrussia"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0b5/542/136/0b55421365064901acdf0ed58cc4a111.gif"></a> <br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/63d/405/78e/63d40578ecbf48f28c62f57705c73eb6.gif"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/239049/">https://habr.com/ru/post/239049/</a></p>
