    <h3>  On the realities of modern mining </h3><br>  Mining is a business with a significant amount of risk and unpredictability.  The high volatility of cryptocurrency can almost instantly leave the miner without pants, or vice versa will allow you to rapidly double or triple the investment.  There is always a bit of market ‚Äúmagic‚Äù, for example, when you plan to withdraw namnennuyu crypt in fiatnye assets, and some light-Coin adds 30% of the cost over the weekend. <br><br>  Today, there are disputes about how easy it is to mine as compared to 2016 - 2017.  Despite significant skepticism, which naturally changed the cryptotype, I can state with confidence that this is not so.  In 2016, there was a problem with the availability of equipment, it was relatively hard to purchase asiki officially, and there were no specialized data centers with mining equipment. <br><br>  The most common method of mining in 2016 was the construction of a rig from video cards and the installation of a truss in a garage or on a balcony, ideally also with a solar panel, in order to minimize production costs.  Now everything has changed, until the prohibitive measures have been taken, the mining equipment is imported officially, has the notification of the FSB and is implemented with full VAT. <br><br>  Unfortunately or fortunately, the times of the wild garage-balcony mining and reckless crypto-enthusiasm have sunk into oblivion.  To start mining today, a sensible calculation, attentive business planning, adequate risk management, strong nerves and a clear budget certainty are needed.  Investment strategy for medium and small investments in equipment is calculated for three years. <br><br>  There are various options for mining strategies and investing.  For example, with a one-time purchase of equipment or with a multiple expansion of the park for three years.  The latter approach is considered more balanced. <br><br>  In any case, before starting the production of cryptoactive assets, the equipment market should be studied independently or with the help of outside experts.  Based on what you studied, buy ASICs and put them on a hosting.  Obviously, it is more profitable to buy the most modern equipment, provided that its PoW algorithms have already been tested, for example, as SHA-256 for bitcoin and SCRYPT for litecoin.  Otherwise, the probability of being left without pants increases in proportion to the level of uncertainty of the algorithms and the non-repeatability of the ASIC miner. <br><br>  It is possible to reduce costs by purchasing used equipment, the same L3 + can be found in decent technical condition in China.  It is important to understand that the cost often changes and it is really cheap to find a relatively powerful ASIC-miner only after thorough monitoring of prices on the market.  There is also the possibility of buying equipment at home, which will already be on the shelf in the hosting.  There are already mining hotels in Russia where you can start mining right after payment.  It is natural that in such cases starting costs will be somewhat higher, but on the other hand, there are no risks to buy low-quality used equipment. <br><br><h3>  Case for the efficient extraction of lightcoins </h3><br>  The data is provided by Sergey Arestov, co-founder of BitCluster - a network of mining data centers.  Cryptobusinessman described the experience of one of the company's clients, who purchased the equipment earlier this year.  Using the case study example, we can conclude about the approximate payback period of the equipment (while maintaining the current course dynamics). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lz/db/w3/lzdbw3pixadkaujwizkz238n_tm.png"><br><br>  It should be particularly noted that the case given makes sense to consider when the cost of electricity for mining does not exceed 4 rubles per 1 kW / hour.  The case with a relatively small amount of investments was deliberately chosen, since with large investments even a slow growth of the rate can bring tangible profits.  In this case, we are not talking about investments of less than a million rubles, which is chosen to show the payback of relatively small investments. <br><br>  ASIC miners were acquired in China on February 17, 2019.  The devices were on the way to Moscow for three weeks.  After receiving them immediately sent to Bratsk, to the site to the operator.  So, on March 22nd, the process of extracting lightcoin began with their help. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uw/w-/go/uww-got8y-8zigxffolovodj6rk.jpeg"><br><br>  115 L3 + were purchased, the cost of which with the power supply - 7460 rubles.  In total, the price of devices amounted to 857900 rubles, including delivery from China, as well as transportation to Bratsk.  At the site in Bratsk, the asiki was placed at the ‚ÄúFree hosting‚Äù tariff, which involves payment, by offsetting at the expense of mined coins.  The tariff provides for daily coverage based on the cost of electricity - 3.53 rubles per kW / hour. <br><br>  The table below shows the payments from L3 + devices including the payment for hosting services on a netting basis. <br><blockquote><br><div class="scrollable-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>  <b>date</b> </td><td>  <b>Payments in LTC minus the cost of service</b> </td><td>  <b>LTC

80 days.  By last month, 84.57 LTC ‚Äã‚Äãor 11,127 dollars (at the current LTC rate) or 712,128 rubles were obtained in this case.  Those.  for more than two months, the client has paid back 83% (data as of June 12) from investments of 857900 rubles.  If such conditions and dynamics are preserved, by the end of June the miner will be able to recoup his investments and continue to earn another 2 - 3 years until the complexity of the blocks makes the equipment obsolete. <br><br>  L3 + will remain relevant, as a device for mining, for at least 2 years.  It is difficult to predict how profitable the application of an ASIC miner will be, but judging by the case described, there are big chances to recoup the investment many times over. <br><br><h3>  As a conclusion </h3><br><br>  Contrary to stereotypes, mining still does not require astronomical investments and the tasks of earning income from the mining of coins can be solved by relatively small budgets.  Of course, there are risks of losses associated with volatility, equipment marriage and bans on the part of regulators, which rarely stops crypto-enthusiasts in pursuit of a long coin.  I would appreciate your assessment of the case presented, as well as cases known to you with successful and unsuccessful mining investments. <br><br>  <i><i>Photo used:</i></i> <i><br><br></i>  <i><a href="https://gtbrain.ru/product/bitmain-antminer-l3-504-mh-s/">gtbrain.ru/product/bitmain-antminer-l3-504-mh-s</a></i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="https://forum.bits.media/index.php%3F/topic/43696-%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D1%2583%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0-l3/">forum.bits.media/index.php?/topic/43696-%D0%BC%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B2%D0BB%D0%BF%D0BB%D0% BA% D1% 83% D0% BF% D0% BA% D0% B0-l3</a></i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/458358/">https://habr.com/ru/post/458358/</a></p>
