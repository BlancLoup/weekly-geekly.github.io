In fact, we don‚Äôt even know on what principle our Twitter feed or Twitter post is formed, who forms it and why.  For us, they invent problems and make us dive into them, subjectively breaking the reality and replicating artificially created opinions and images.  The monopoly of information resources is now not something that is not uncommon, but even the usual course of things. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Approximately with such reflections of <i>Alexander Olshansky</i> , the founder of the event, iForum 7.0 began.  in Kiev on April 16, 2015. The event, according to the organizers, gathered more than 6 thousand participants. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a9a/1a4/300/a9a1a4300b3b41d8b27df65314c847a3.png"><br><br>  How to get informational freedom when they try to limit it daily?  The basic metric of freedom is such a simple phenomenon as diversity.  First, study different sources, secondly, cultivate critical thinking, thirdly, realize that each of us is a source of information - be careful, check, tell the truth.

      Now is a great time.  The availability of the creation of various services.  The time for the development of a startup movement that can create competition for monopolistic giants.  Time to engage a lot of people in order to try out a lot of ideas, filtering and implementing the best. <br><br>  In general, we are now doing this with many other startups. <br><br>  So, briefly and in fact, let's take a look at the reports that we, the linguistic freelance-exchange 2polyglot, liked, as a participant, on the iForum.  And also can be useful to beginners. <br><br>  <b>"Fundraising tips for startup"</b> <br>  <i>Stephane Gantchev, "LAUNCHub"</i> <br><br>  1. <b>It's all about people</b> : in 80% of cases it all depends on how you ‚Äúsell‚Äù the project, and not on its technical magnificence <br>  2. <b>Think over and make a ‚Äúcap table‚Äù of a startup</b> : you can‚Äôt be too greedy, but it‚Äôs also dangerous to give to investors too much - weigh everything, think it over, feel it. <br>  3. <b>You can not do everything alone</b> : create a team of professionals (3-4 people will be enough). <br>  4. <b>Do not waste time on all people and all activities for startups</b> : carefully select events to which you are going to attend, attend those whose usefulness is certain.  The same with people - do not tell about the project to everyone who called himself an investor - check whether the person really invested;  what they write about him on the net. <br>  5. <b>Build a relationship with an investor</b> : a few meetings and calls will not hurt, and monthly project development reports are simply necessary. <br>  6. <b>‚ÄúNo‚Äù means ‚Äúnot now‚Äù</b> : be moderately persistent <br>  7. <b>The speed of fulfillment of plans, promises</b> : if promised - make on time.  And just do the planned, develop - it is always felt and inspires investor confidence. <br><br>  <b>"About the RTB tool"</b> <br>  <i>Vitaly Gorduz, ‚ÄúUMH Digital‚Äù</i> <br><br>  For those who look at these three letters in bewilderment - an explanation: <br>  <b>RTB</b> (English Real Time Bidding) - is a real-time auction of advertisements.  Based on the Iabs Open-RTB 2010 protocol. <br><br>  In other words, this is a technology for displaying a message, relying not on the site (website / page), but on the target audience, regardless of where the latest announcement will overtake.  Thus, you, as an advertiser, avoid wasting your irrelevant audience on showing your message. <br><br>  Visual difference - choose what you like <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d1b/428/4ff/d1b4284ff9904d74976f5bb51ad702ee.png"><br><br>  <i>Kirill Kunitsky, the founder of Business Designer,</i> shared the following <b>sales success-scheme</b> .  It is well applicable to those projects whose sales cycle (from the moment of receiving knowledge about a product-service to the moment of purchase) is rather short. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d2a/219/a78/d2a219a78b9544c488cfba47d8b57937.png"><br><br>  <b>Twitter - Marketing in the Moment</b> <br>  <i>Nlall Horgan, Twitter</i> <br><br>  The main distinctive features (they are also strengths) of Twitter, according to the speaker, are that: <br>  <i>Alive</i> - events are happening in it right now <br>  <i>Public</i> - it brings together many people <br>  <i>Means to communicate people</i> <br><br>  It is these features that should be used for promotion.  About 3.5 billion tweets are generated weekly within the community.  Whatever people are different, they are united by many desires, sensations, actions. <br><br>  <b>Analysis</b> <br>  Based on a study of tweets, you can find out what time of the day most people get bored.  On which day of the week people run the most in the morning or go shopping.  By researching the necessary behavioral patterns that apply to your product, you can post a tweet that will resonate with your audience the most.  Thus, you have the opportunity to get a high spread of your tweet and remind / tell more people about your company. <br><br>  <b>Be in trend</b> <br>  It is important and useful to use the mainstream on Twitter right now.  Catch the wave.  Adapt it for yourself.  And your tweet is doomed to retweet.  If the new season of the Game of Thrones came out - play with the Iron Throne, and if it turned out that the new iPhone is bending - ‚Äúbend‚Äù your logo - show that you are aware. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/049/1c0/a42/0491c0a4213f4ce599541a42ac643551.jpg"><br><br>  <b>‚ÄúMoving into a crisis quickly: shifting the point of pleasure to a result‚Äù</b> <br>  <i>Alexander Pervak, "Datamaaster", "Gifterland"</i> <br><br>  Many people know the feeling when the first chapter of the book read gives the illusion that you have already achieved the result.  Most likely you do not read the book in this case. <br><br>  In order to continue to grow, you need to move the point of satisfaction with yourself / process / project to a later period.  To do this, we mark ourselves a period when we allow ourselves to be satisfied, like launching a beta version of a product, for example. <br><br>  <b>Next, do the following procedure:</b> <br>  1. We break work on the project into stages <br>  2. We visualize these stages, for example, on the wall. <br>  3. Denote the stage at which we allow ourselves to enjoy the result obtained. <br>  4. We cross out the stages <br>  5. We reach the period of "joy" and praise ourselves for the work done. <br>  6. We continue to work until the next reached peak. <br><br>  Such a method, according to the speaker, allows the team to remain motivated and in good shape, and the project to develop. <br><br>  <b>‚ÄúBDSM in startups and how to do it yourself‚Äù</b> <br>  <i>Yuri Titkov, Olshansky and Partners</i> <br><br>  Yuri intrigued, probably, everyone already at the stage of learning the program iForum. <br>  So, what is BDSM: Business, Development, Sales, Marketing - those whales, on which there is a successful startup. <br><br>  The main thing you need to remember and how to guide the work on a startup is: <br>  1) You need to understand your target audience. <br>  2) It is necessary to exceed the expectations of the target through communication <br>  3) Communication is the main thing that keeps your relationship with the user <br>  Conclusions made by the speaker after many years of work with startups: <br>  1. SEO is not a panacea.  Internal site optimization and content marketing will give more coverage to Central Asia. <br>  2. SMM is an effective promotion channel, but you have to become opinion leaders yourself. <br>  3. PR - the best marketing strategy. <br><br>  In order to be successful in your business, you need to understand what problem your startup solves for a certain group of people, find these people and help (not sell!) Them to solve their problem, exceeding expectations through communication. <br><br>  You can and should search for your target audience through the means of crowd marketing: look for questions / feedback related to your product / service;  install Google Alerts and get keyword alerts;  track comments through Disqus;  Communicate with potential users through social networks;  Search sites that match your subject through LiveInternet. <br><br>  Of course, the event was not limited to these theses, speakers and reports, but we hope that we will become useful with a short summary by 2polyglot. <br><br>  In the end - a few not included notes: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d6c/a46/ecc/d6ca46ecce704f9dbb3c4229aaf849b1.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/46c/d55/e63/46cd55e635f64df488c6b0a768b9257e.jpg"><br><br><habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/289784/">https://habr.com/ru/post/289784/</a></p>
