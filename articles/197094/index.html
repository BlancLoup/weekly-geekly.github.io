      "A-mega" is a browser-based multiplayer collectible card strategy that everyone will like! <br>  Throwing open the door to an amazing world in which the characters of the usual children's fairy tales are woven into the dystopia of a diesel engine, the player will have to make difficult and, at times, ambiguous decisions. <br>  And also - to learn an adult story about how fairy tales have grown ... <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/sWgVcK3Az3A%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500002,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhi1HYwMm_1hWJQ_hvldnZZljDfvkA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Why are we doing <b>A-mega</b> ?</b> <br>  Sooner or later, each developer starts to create a special, very personal game.  Once upon a time, many of us at school age, and some at college, played Magic: The Gathering (MTG), not even assuming then that we would work in the gaming industry.  The years went by, the time for MTG is long gone.  But the nostalgia for collecting and exchanging the cards you need, thinking up combinations and fierce battles with friends, because of the ambiguous English description of the card - remained.  Well, what else can you compare the joy of buying a booster and gambling excitement when it is opened: what if a ‚Äúrar‚Äù card comes across ?! <br><br>  Well, here it would be necessary to write a boring excursion into the history of collectibles, but we just recall that the American hobby, picking up baseball cards, is considered to be the prototype of card collectibles.  The game has not gained popularity and the new genre has sunk into oblivion for many years, until in 1993 Richard Garfield developed the concept of Magic: The Gathering.  The game literally ‚Äúblew up‚Äù the world, giving rise to the foundation for hundreds of clones and raising a whole generation of players. <br>  So, having found a valuable point of reference, we got together and thought: ‚ÄúWell, how much can you work?  We have many years of experience and hard work.  Why not finally relax, and not to release the project for your own pleasure? " <br>  Of course, I did not have to think about what the genre of the new game would be.  Could we have missed such a chance?  Moreover, the scriptwriters have saved an unusual and interesting world for a special occasion, and the start has been given! <br><br>  <b>Where do dreams lead?</b> <br>  After the approval of the project, we armed ourselves with old ideas, shabby notebooks with ideological scribbles and instantly joined the workflow, starting to discuss mechanics.  We perfectly understood that it was high time for the CCI genre (collectible card games) to make changes and to please the audience with something new.  Many prototypes were created.  We both played them, and drew diagrams, and laid them out with cookies ‚Äî we went through different mechanics.  Meanwhile, game design with a serious look cut out paper ‚Äúproto-cards‚Äù with scissors with names like: ‚Äúsuper-strong ubivaka‚Äù, ‚Äúmulti-shot‚Äù, ‚Äúgov @ ohiller‚Äù and ‚Äúhell-her‚Äù. <br>  But be that as it may, at last, the new mechanic was approved, and the descriptions of the first concepts went to the art department.  Here's what the scriptwriters are thinking up: connect the now-fashionable diesel engine with classic European fairy tales!  The art department broke into a smile - the artists were instructed to draw fairy-tale heroines, but in a pin-up style! <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/790/de4/91d/790de491dd6afdf4304b7958e638c79e.png"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/51c/82e/3aa/51c82e3aae6ecb3d15b271795fb74e7f.jpg"></div><br><br>  Before our eyes, the fantastic world of the 50s of the 20th century grew up on its own, with its huge airliners and skyscrapers drowning in clouds of diesel smoke.  After the first luxurious concept art, we realized that we had hit the target, and any dream was worth it! <br>  We are sure that the original world of ‚ÄúA-mega‚Äù will appeal to an intellectual audience that prefers an exciting gameplay and high-quality screenwriting.  And for this, we work tirelessly, and often stay in the office until late to once again discuss the details, correct mistakes, discuss future plans. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">One of the first prototypes of the game</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/9b0/237/c87/9b0237c87439c0b6d6898d9c65d8429c.jpg"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/53c/80a/79b/53c80a79bc114e95efc08176b5d0e797.jpg"></div></div></div><br><br>  <b>Give it a play!</b>  <b>Well, pozhaaaluysta!</b> <br>  We look forward to the moment when we can hand the game over to the players!  In the meantime, we <a href="http://a-megagame.ru/news/view/start/">are preparing for the start of closed beta testing</a> , from which we will begin to acquaint you with the world of "A-mega".  Do not doubt, it will be interesting! <br><br>  <b>And what next?</b> <br>  Literally in our next publication, we would like to submit to the ¬´haboobschestvennosti‚Äô court a slightly unusual presentation of material. <br>  Yes, we want to try on the "technical" resource to interest you in the literary, or better even to say, the artistic component of our project, which we hope will not disappoint you! <br><br>  <b>See you again!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/197094/">https://habr.com/ru/post/197094/</a></p>
