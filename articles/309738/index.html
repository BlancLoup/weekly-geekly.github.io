Happy Programmer's Day!  To my sad regret, on the past Day of the Sysadmin I did not find any contests or quests on the Internet, as was the case in previous years (there is a possibility, of course, that I was looking bad).  Therefore, I decided to create my quest for you.  To combine business with pleasure, I wrote a quest-story <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/307710/">continued</a> about NIICHOSI. <a name="habracut"></a>  The text hides all the necessary clues to solve.  All past quest will receive +20 to the strength of the system administrator. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> Congratulations to the user <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/midvikus/" class="user_link">midvikus</a> , he first sent a secret code!  Thank you all for participating! <br>  <b>At the end of the article, I added the stages of the solution quest.</b> <br><br>  So, I still work in a large IT company as an administrator on duty.  This quest story was born in the weekend between duty.

    <h3>  NIICHOSHI.  Newbie </h3><br>  A white-orange carpal expander flew in from behind, hit the keyboard, and galloped off the monitor.  I turned around.  All with a deadpan look sat at their computers. <br>  - Max, an infection, I know it is you.  - I noticed how his shoulders shook with laughter. <br>  - No, well, boring.  This month is my last but one night watch.  Of the tasks there was only to execute several scripts and change the parameters in the config of a pair of databases.  Nothing broke.  I stupidly monitored all night and all.  Boring <br>  ‚ÄúYou have to be on duty for fifteen minutes.‚Äù  Micah, you let him go.  Take a watch, and then he rushes. <br>  - Do not let his do-vy.  I still have an important matter.  - answered Micha, chewing on cookies and drinking tea from his half-liter mug with the inscription ‚Äúrm will save him from all problems‚Äù. <br>  Today, finally, I am not on duty.  And in general, this month I was given five days to work so that I could rest from the night / day shifts.  Therefore, today I am waiting for a calm day with knocking out documentation on new services from our developers, erasing triggers in the monitoring system and other trifles.  The next month, they will throw me back on duty again, and, I‚Äôm 100% sure, that I will fall on the day for Programmer Day.  Last month, the great holiday - the Sysadmin Day, fortunately, was wonderful and relaxed.  Everything worked fine.  We were congratulated by the staff, from the accounting even brought a cake.  The management of NIICHOSI (Scientific Research Institute of Private Objects of Information Systems) for our department organized a small buffet table.  They know that the entire data center is holding onto us!  It ended up with admin entertainment, such as throwing mice for accuracy and a contest "Who quickly shaves, so that it also works", as well as a small "firework" of soldered capacitors on a separate board, where Kostya applied more voltage.  And of course, with a slight reprimand from the general, for the fire alarm that worked (a mitigating circumstance was the fact that we checked it in action at the same time). <br>  Now the very beginning of the working day.  The duty officer on the data center today was Micah, only Kostya was the admin.  Potap and Cyril went to St. Petersburg for a meeting of sysadmins.  I and the Brain (Anton) leisurely engaged in our current tasks, simultaneously discussing news from the IT world and recent articles from Habr.  The door to the office squeaked, and Evgeny Pavlovich Linus entered. <br>  - Hello.  How are we doing?  Who is on duty today?  - from the threshold began our head. <br>  - Today, Michael is on duty during the day.  - Max said, yawning.  - Everything is working.  Problems only with the transfer of the shift.  The attendant is completely wounded and does not want to work. <br>  - Eeee, Vasya!  Who are you hit by?  Smatra attentively, three seconds ago, unsubscribed that he was on duty!  - Micah gave voice. <br>  - Voooot, well, now I have spat to sleep.  - Max answered, got ready and disappeared behind the office door. <br>  - So, now that everything is in the field - the news of the day.  We are new, said Yevgeny Pavlovich.  - Yes, that's so unexpected.  And that is not all.  He was interviewed by Boris Mikhailovich himself.  It was decided to conduct an experiment on the new method of teaching new employees to our department.  Beginner immediately put the second duty and fight!  And yet, Sasha, you are the most "fresh" employee in order for you to consolidate your knowledge once again - give an introductory briefing.  Tell us what we have and how, the rules of duty other, other.  Then give it to Michael.  And he will already see how he works in combat conditions.  Well, something like this.  Ruslan, come in. <br>  The door opened and a new employee entered. <br><br>  An orange T-shirt with the words ‚ÄúI'm not a loser‚Äù covered his very plump body.  He looked about twenty-five years old.  Short black hair stood a hedgehog on his head, and at the top of his head a stubborn tuft rushed up.  The face was large and it seemed that the glasses were hanging not on the nose, but on the cheeks.  In general, if you add up two me, you will get his physique (finally, this term can be interpreted literally). <br>  - Hello.  - Ruslan shyly said. <br>  His voice was very subtle and did not interfere with appearance.  Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed Micah, with slow movements, hiding his cookies in his nightstand.  Kostya appeared behind the transparent door to our office.  He flinched a bit when he noticed the newcomer, then puffed out his cheeks and depicted his stomach, tucking the monitor that was carrying somewhere under his t-shirt.  We, seeing this picture, barely restrained laughter.  It was evident that Ruslan was embarrassed, thinking that they were laughing at him.  His ears are red.  Evgeny Pavlovich also stood for a few seconds in bewilderment, then turned round sharply.  From surprise, Kostya‚Äôs hands twitched and the monitor slipped out from under his clothes.  With dexterity inherent in acrobats and sysadmins, he successfully kept his foot, grabbed his hand, and the second waved to Evgeny Pavlovich.  Our manager showed him a fist, and Kostya, apparently remembering urgent business, rushed off somewhere to the elevator. <br>  - Hmmm, clowns, damn it.  So, Alexander, take a newbie.  Start with the rules and then in order.  Ruslan, your workplace will be over there.  Sit down and ... uh, where is his computer?  - asked Palych.  - I wrote to Kirill last night to prepare the workplace.  And he answered.  Unsubscribed: "Well, I'll do everything, but a little later." <br>  - Evgeny Palych, he and Potap left the day before yesterday.  And he put an auto reply on the mail.  Therefore, he is now all so responsible.  - explained Brain.  - And the computer ... let it take the place of Max.  He is still not there.  And I already prepared an accounting for it. <br>  - It is strange that I find out the last about all this.  In general, Ruslan, sit down for a while. <br>  Our head stomped to his place, and the newcomer got behind Max‚Äôs computer.  I sat down with him and began a tedious story about the rules of duty.  Micah interrupted my lecture: <br>  - San, listen.  I get a call from our personnel department.  They do not print MFPs there.  They say it is not available from computers, but they are urgent.  Kostya, as always, doesn‚Äôt pick up the phone, apparently hiding somewhere.  Go see what they have there.  This unit is networked.  Maybe with a wire that.  Who pulled or bitten. <br>  - Well, I just broke up with a lecture ... Well, uh ... Ruslan.  You still read this documentary.  I'm fast now. <br>  I started to get ready.  Took a bag with tools.  He hung a piece of vituku on his shoulder, pressed his teeth into his teeth and tightened the bandage on his head.  The view was awesome.  The duty officer spoke: <br>  - Oh, God, Alexander!  They are just users! <br>  - Nothing, I'm ready for any eventuality! <br>  The personnel department is not some kind of bookkeeping for you.  I was ready.  I went up to the floor and entered the office.  I went to the multifunction device.  I plugged it into the outlet.  I printed a couple of sheets for verification.  I caught rave eyes on myself.  I went back to my department. <br>  - Oh, and you quickly!  What was there? <br>  - Don't even ask. <br>  I threw all the tools on my desk and went back to Max‚Äôs workplace, where the newcomer was sitting. <br>  - Well, move on.  - I opened the monitoring window. <br><br>  A white-green set of triggers met me with a system. <br>  - Oh, cool.  Not a single red trigger.  And what is this new - some white? <br>  - Yes, this Potap screwed.  Some dropping packets are monitored on dispatcher servers.  Filter them simply, so that the eyes are not corns. <br>  - OK.  Ruslan, have you worked with any monitoring systems before?  Although no difference.  We still have a little different.  Here look. <br>  I briefly talked about our monitoring system.  And he decided that I had enough. <br>  - So, Micah - take a fighter.  I told him everything I could, I told him, then you check his knowledge.  Give him what the task is ... <br>  - So, let's figure it out.  Ruslan, look, here are the unsolved tasks on our department.  If agreed Palych - then do it.  There will be questions - just ask. <br>  With a calm soul, I went to my workplace.  Brewed some coffee and began to poke around in their affairs.  Kostya looked into our office. <br>  - Hello to newcomers!  Guys, you do not know who deployed a server for a new calculation service?  I can't connect to it via ssh.  It feels like I'm drowning the wall. <br>  - Listen, this is Max picking.  - answered Brain.  - You do not forget, he has a little of this, in addition, at the expense of security.  He probably put ssh on some of the forty-three thousandths, as always.  Try some forty-three thousand two hundred and thirtieth or twentieth, and maybe tenth. <br>  - Ooh, I have to sort them all out, or what?  I'll scan something. <br>  - Well, or call him, he is sleeping, really ... <br>  - Well, or so, he himself is to blame - Kostya answered and ran to his office. <br>  Then the newcomer cast a vote: <br>  - Michael, but you will not tell: here in the task it is indicated to find out why such a large load is on the niichosi-sender server.  I do not let go there under my account. <br>  - And, this is a separate server, just come under the user.  - Micah helped him. <br>  - And the password? <br>  - And the password is the easiest there.  It consists of the name of our research institute and one of the most common passwords.  In Latin, of course, without gaps! <br>  - Mic, but just like that - do not tell the password?  - asked Brain.  - Love you with rebuses! <br>  - Nothing, let him think.  Let's see why Mikhalych decided to let him go straight into the battle.  - responded Micah. <br>  Yes it was weird.  At least, when I came to NIICHOSI to the administration department of the data center, they drove me for a couple of months according to the theory.  And only then put on duty.  And at first, they practically did not give tasks for execution.  And then - immediately into battle! <br>  - Here is an infection!  - wail Micah.  - Hike, base analytics went!  Brain, look what's there.  I will answer for the time being.  We have about five minutes, not more.  And then our technical support will be overwhelmed! <br>  The guys took up the problem.  I also decided to look, so to practice.  Climbed into pgAdmin.  Well, as always!  Locks on the base. <br>  - Alexander.  - Ruslan again voiced.  - Do not tell me, if you have someone here who wants to go to the bathroom, then where is he going? <br>  The question has discouraged me a little. <br>  - Uh, how come out - immediately to the right. <br>  - Thank. <br>  Newcomer out. <br>  - Strange fellow!  Said the Brain.  - More precisely, it is not small ... <br>  - Stop.  The base has risen!  Or rather the locks are gone.  - the attendant was delighted.  - It is necessary to fix the problem.  Soooo, only three minutes did not work ... <br>  He began to fill out the document.  It took about ten minutes.  The door squeaked - Ruslan returned. <br>  - Pancake!  Again, some school with this base.  Triggers are crazy.  Who so much them stuck on one base?  Lock again!  - again began to lament Micah. <br>  - Ruslan, wait a minute!  - I have an idea.  - Go out for a couple of minutes. <br>  - Excuse me, what happened? <br>  - Come out, come out.  Something you need to check! <br>  The newcomer went out again. <br>  - Micah, check the base.  - I shouted to the attendant. <br>  - Nichosi!  Everything is clear!  Do you think it is related? <br>  - Listen, and on which server load was?  - asked Brain.  ‚ÄúWhere did the Padawan go?‚Äù <br>  The door to the office opened slightly and Ruslan's head appeared in the doorway. <br>  - Can I have it already? <br>  - Yes, come on faster.  You performed the task with the load on the server?  - asked Micah. <br>  - Yes of course.  The load is gone. <br>  - How did you do? <br>  - Reboot the server! <br>  Micah already, shuddered with indignation. <br>  - Fuck !?  You should have asked at first.  Naturally, our analyst has collapsed! <br>  - Okay, I'll correct it.  - stopped the tirade on duty Brain.  - Since you start, Ruslan.  And in general, it was possible, at a minimum, to get by with the restart of the service.  And maybe even just requests to the base to beat.  We had to see who eats percents and consult with us.  Now our attendant will exhale and give you another task. <br>  - I apologize.  I always rebooted the Windows and everything was fine, the problems were gone.  - answered Ruslan and sat down at max's comp. <br><br>  Blue screen of death adorned the workplace monitor Max. <br>  - Oh, I did not touch anything!  The newbie exclaimed, a little frightened. <br>  - Mr. Jamb!  Is it often with you?  - I asked Ruslan. <br>  - You know, next to me, the equipment is often buggy, I, therefore, began to poke around with it in order to understand how to fix it! <br>  - Evgeny Palych, can he go to testers better?  He will not settle down here!  - said Micah, referring to our boss. <br>  - There is nothing ahead of time to vote.  Let me go and watch the month, we'll see there, answered Palych. <br>  ‚ÄúIt may not last so long ...‚Äù noted Micah with regret. <br>  - Nothing.  Boris Mikhailovich said that he is a strong guy.  Three years in technical support provider otpahal. <br>  - Yes, I'm not talking about him!  I'm talking about our data center. <br>  Ruslan at this time, red as a cancer, rebooted the working comp.  It was evident that he was not comfortable in such an environment, but he didn‚Äôt intend to give up from the very first day. <br>  - Fucking switch!  - Bones screamed from the next room, and then there was a fierce hammering of the hammer. <br>  All computers in our office for a second cut off the network.  I rushed quickly to our system administrator to the rescue.  Having run into the office, I saw that Kostya was straightening some piece of iron with a hammer. <br>  - Phew, I already thought that you are liquidating the switch.  And what if our network blinks?  - I asked the admin. <br>  - Yes, I touched your switch with my foot.  Maybe the wire pulled.  In general, it is necessary to throw in the closet.  He has been lying here since last week.  But, it is already at night. <br>  - Ok, I went.  See how a newbie is wise. <br>  I went back to my workplace.  The newbie tried hard to do something on a server.  It was evident that he did not have enough knowledge of Linux for this work.  And yet it is strange, why did his gendir immediately decide to start a fight?  It will be necessary somehow to ask Palych.  Dinner time was coming.  It's time to go to the dining room. <br>  - Brain, let's go for a snack?  - I asked Anton. <br>  - And what, it's time to eat. <br>  - San, have you somehow set up a test server, is he still alive?  You would give a newbie access there.  Evgeny Palych, let him train there, or else I shudder every time he logs in to the next combat!  We already have five red triggers appeared after his actions.  - complained Micah. <br>  - Oh well.  - our manager agreed.  - It is already clear to all that the new teaching method may end in an accident.  From duty - a report on the new employee.  Alexander - give Ruslan access to the test server, let him work with the basic teams and raise a couple of services there, or something ... <br>  - Good.  - I answered and unstick the sticker from my shirt.  - Ruslan, here you are.  Here ip server.  Hmm, a little in a non-standard form, - you will understand.  Login and password are standard, as on all individual servers.  Pick. <br>  ‚ÄúYou wear it, why do you wear it on yourself?‚Äù  - Micah was surprised.  - Yes, and even in this not readable form! <br>  - Yes, you know ... I wanted for you to arrange a quest for the Day of the Sysadmin.  And somehow did not have time with these duties.  I stuck it so I could use it and forget it. <br>  - Eh, sorry I did not have time.  - dreamily noted Brain.  - Okay, let's go. <br>  We moved into the dining room. <br><br>  White-blue, cheerful face of the logo of the company serving us, smiled cheerfully from the door of the dining room.  For them, we waited for a queue of thirty people.  The queue did not move.  At the cashier there was an employee with a full tray, and the cashier frantically poked, it seemed, on all the keys in a row. <br>  - Yeah, trouble.  Strange, at this time usually there is nobody in the dining room and no.  - complained Brain. <br>  - Mikha needs to call.  Maybe we have some cant?  - I suggested.  The payment system in the dining room was tightly tied to our data center.  So, our department could be directly related to this problem. <br>  - I think, yes.  - The brain agreed and dialed the number of the attendant.  - Hello, Micah, is everything normal with the canteen base?  And here is a newcomer?  And he did not climb there?  What about triggers?  Well, connect and watch!  Himself so! <br>  Anton removed the phone and said sadly in his voice: <br>  - He says we have no problems.  I sent Kostya to see if it can with iron.  Will have to wait. <br>  We stood at the end of the queue and began to study the menu.  Fifteen minutes later our system administrator materialized around the cash register.  After a few minutes, he did something, and the cashier happily rushed to punch the waiting order. <br>  - Eh, master.  Skillful fingers.  Said the Brain.  - His technique is obeyed. <br>  - And do not say.  - I agreed.  - I would like that. <br>  Kostya came up to us. <br>  - Guys, and what are you standing, would have come and picked.  Everything is simple there. <br>  - Yes, we thought, maybe it will resolve itself.  - explained Brain.  - And what did you do? <br>  - What is there to do!  Seven troubles - one rezet! <br>  - Damn, you just rebutn him?  You just do not tell this newcomer, otherwise he will forever believe that he will save him from everything. <br>  The queue quickly began to dissolve.  Literally five minutes later we were at the checkout.  When the cashier started punching my dinner, I decided to be funny and asked: <br>  - Hello.  And didn‚Äôt you have a fat chap in an orange T-shirt here today? <br>  - Yes, you know, about two hours ago it was like this.  I came in, bought a couple of pies and left, and just after that, my cash register began to slow down. <br>  Anton grinned.  I scratched my head.  He obviously has some kind of aura that is not good.  We took the order and sat down at a free table.  Less than ten minutes of a quiet dinner, as my phone rang. <br>  - Kirill Paavlovich, good day to you.  - I recognized the voice of Robert Mikhailovich.  - I got access to the server.  Thank you.  As for that piece of iron that you gave me for immediate use from the reserves of your data center, I very successfully attached it to my dachas ... <br>  - Robert Mikhailovich.  But I am not‚Ä¶ <br>  - Young man!  Please do not peeribivat.  So here.  Everything works wonderfully.  We with vaami somehow considered.  But I will ask this incident to remain between us.  By the same this device, in the next you most likely do not fit. <br>  - Robert Mikhailovich, this is not Kirill - this is Alexander. <br>  - Aalesander?  And why do you pick up Kirill Paavlovich‚Äôs work phone?  - asked Robert Mikhailovich with confusion. <br>  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how, but you called my cell phone.‚Äù <br>  - But kaak so!  After all, I called the worker ... <br>  - Most likely, this clever man at the time of his departure put the call forwarding on my phone.  Here come, I will redirect a couple of duties to him! <br>  - Aaleksandr, my friend.  How is your faithful song living?  Pixel seems to be? <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúI have a cat, and not Pixel, but Byte, by the way.‚Äù </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Oh, great. Young man, I would like to ask you not to spread about our current conversation. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You see, for almost a month, our programmers cannot catch the bug in the code of the final information system, which periodically leads to hung methods. I took the responsibility to find this error. I work even from home. And since I live in this wonderful summer in the country, I needed a device for remote connection. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Well, Robert Mikhailovich. Just for business ... By the way, on account of errors. Maybe our new employee can help you? For half a day he put already several systems only by his presence! </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Interesting copy.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- You talk to Evgeny Pavlovich, I think he will agree to a small internship in your department. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Much thankful. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I put the phone down and said to Anton, to the beefing-up patty: </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúListen, I drove off the shoal of Mr. Jamb. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Oh, bullshit!</font></font><br>  - What? <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Great, I say. - chewing answered Brain. - One problem less. Come eat up, and send Micah to please. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The green cactus that once stood near the monitor in Max‚Äôs workplace, where Ruslan was sitting now, seems to have turned gray. Mikhail made himself a foil hat from a long-eaten chocolate. Palych already somewhere dumped. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Oh, finally you are back! Said the attendant with joy. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- San, where do you get the service logs on that test server? Our new employee can not figure it out. And I have no time! </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Ruslan, in general, as always, the logs all add up to / var / log. There is most likely a file with the prefix nii. Show me, how do you look? - I asked the novice.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Alexander, you know, I can still log in. I tried several passwords, but apparently something broke and now does not let me at all. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Well, right. I kind of experimented with fail2ban, and you were banned after several unsuccessful attempts. Nothing, in a few minutes you will be let in again. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- So, why did you ask me about the logs, if you have not even logged in yet? - Micah was surprised. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- You see, Mikhail, I thought - all of a sudden, when I log in there will be no one around from the staff, what will I do then? </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The attendant rolled his eyes. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- That is, next to you, not only the equipment is buggy, but it can also knock a person down? </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- No, that you. You did not understand me correctly, I meant ...</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Evgeny Palych entered the office. And immediately from the door said: </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Ruslan. With things on the way out! </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- And what happened? Did I do something? Very bad right?</font></font><br>  - Not.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Temporarily we transfer you to an internship in the department of programmers. To Robert Mikhailovich Stollov. They need a man there. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Wow! This is even more interesting! And what will I do there? - the newbie was delighted. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- All questions later and to another leader. Let's go to. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Bye everyone. - Ruslan said goodbye. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I waved to him. Brain nodded. The door squeaked and Palych with Ruslan left. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Hallelujah! - Micah cried out and, pulling off a foil cap from his head, crumpled it and skillfully got into the trashcan at the other end of the office. - Is not it a miracle! I thought the system would not live to the end of the working day! </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Say thanks to Alexander. - explained Brain. - It was he who merged him Mikhalych. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Oh, thank you. You have a cookie! Why are there cookies, I have a beer!</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We let go of the joyful attendant for lunch. After a couple of hours of operation, the monitoring system was completely colored with green triggers. At the end of the working day Robert Mikhailovich called me and once again personally thanked: </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Aaleksandr. People like Ruslaan are a rare find. What can taam talk about the bug I told you about. After ten minutes of using the system, he not only achieved the manifestation of this bug, but it also turned out that he did not fall through! Praavda at the same time, this young man accidentally rebooted a working computer with three scripts started. But this is all small things! </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yes, it happens, so the place finds a person ...</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A white-brown cable channel appeared in the opened cabinet door, then the carrier itself entered. Kostya put the box in the corner, sat down on an empty chair and began to complain: </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- No, well, you think about it, the secretary of our CEO is calling me and complains that she has a bad chair rolling around. It would seem that I have something to do with it? It turns out that she was already calling an engineer, he said that these were the problems of the admins. Well, she call me right away. Well, I came there. And ohrenel. There vituha around the wheels about ten times wrapped! I say: ‚ÄúYou have all the wires in the box were hidden away! Why is it open and half broken? ‚Äù She answers me: ‚ÄúI pulled out the wire when I needed to rearrange the kettle, otherwise it hits me with steam when it boils‚Äù! In short, I told a lot of things to her - she was offended. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Eh, Kostyan.</font></font> This is what!<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- answered Brain. ‚ÄúI saw her covering up with uncovered rosettes with foil behind her wall.‚Äù He says electrical radiation in the back beats. And from this the head hurts her. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The guys still complained to each other about careless users. I once again told in detail my story from the first New Year‚Äôs night duty. All neighing. And on this joyous note, Kostya retired to his office, not forgetting to capture the box. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Guys, do you not know what these new problems are? - asked Micah. - Why did the developer send me an archive with some data and wrote that he needed to be sent to one of our clients. Are we now IT couriers? </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Yes, it was already like that. This we send to VIP clients. Rarely, but it happens. There is a documentary inside the archive, it says there who will be sent to. - I replied.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- So the archive is password-protected. I asked the author - he does not know the password. He says that Vitek did it from development. I call him and he is not a subscriber. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Yes, there they use a four-digit password. Try one-two-three-four. Well, or broken programs. Such passwords are selected in a few seconds. - I advised. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Forever they have everything through ... And no protection and a lot of problems with this! - the attendant complained. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We sat for another fifteen minutes and now finally the long-awaited six o'clock in the evening.</font></font> Hooray!<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Home! We gathered with Anton, wished Mikhe a successful duty (transfer of the shift only at nine in the evening, he will be replaced again by Max) and went home. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On the threshold of the apartment my pet was waiting for me. Seeing me, happy cat Byte began to rub against his legs. He clearly made it clear that it was time for him to add a couple more bits of weight. After feeding the cat and having dinner, I sat down at the computer and decided to play. After a couple of hours, flying like a flash, the phone rang. Called Max. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Who was sitting in my place? Who touched my mouse? Who rebooted my comp? - in a loud voice began duty. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Hello. Did Michael not tell you anything about today? </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Yes, well, him. As soon as I came in - he said that everything was working well, and got it down.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Well, yes, it's in his style. In general, today a newbie tried to work here. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Is that the fat one standing at the door when I left in the morning? </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Yes, this is it. So when he ... </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I retold all of today to Max. Of course, he was extremely unhappy that Ruslan was sitting at his computer. But neighing over everything else. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Listen, Sanya. And what do we have now, new triggers appeared? I look, I have developed our monitoring system. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Well, yes - white. Micah told me already. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- No, the whites have long been. Now new ones, which means that seventy and more percent of all our systems do not work! </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- No, I have not heard this yet. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúAnd you know what color they chose for this?‚Äù </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Uh, and what? </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Brown!</font></font><br><br>  <b>Decision:</b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 1.
