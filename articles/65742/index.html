  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mass filtering media</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Illumined this morning.  The real modern media is not the media.  This - the media <u>filtering</u> .  It is for them that the future for the next hundred years, or even more.  With abundant media, especially considering the development of communication technologies, the most urgent problem of consumption is not the search for sources, but their filtering.  What we are seeing now. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The methods of data transmission are unified, thanks to the laws of economics and networks (Sarnov, Metcalfe, Reed) only some standards remain afloat.  Who does not have time to gain critical mass dies.  As a result, we have XML, personal communication devices, Google Reader, Yandex.Direct, etc.  Google Reader helps to filter RSS feeds, Yandex. Direct filters the flow of advertising.  In this sense, it is interesting to note that Yandex.News and Google News are unfinished products, they are now stuck on the halfway point of development.  They (and other aggregators of this kind) are waiting for the next stage, in which they: <br>  a) learn to handle not only textual content; <br>  b) learn to filter it not by its algorithms, but by the algorithms set by the user. <br><br>  So far, even Google Alert is ahead of them in development.  Anything that does not give the possibility of personalization will die.  In this case, a kind of personalization is waiting for content producers.  It will need to be formed / assembled / distributed very narrowly, down to the interests of the individual.  Otherwise, the media product will not be claimed.  At the same time, one should not be afraid that the media economy will not be profitable.  As soon as the audience of the media reaches a critical mass, when devices become ubiquitous like newspapers, radio, TV, the economy of the media will once again become profitable. <br><br>  So, those media that want to step in the near future need to learn how to create narrowly focused content, learn how to process and shape their products out of it so flexibly so that they can be in the interests of every reader, and make the delivery as individual. <br>  This is the future of personal media.  And in this sense, we are developing in a spiral, like our entire history.  In the development of media, we return to the Middle Ages.  For simplification of understanding I will result the scheme.

This media was not massive, and their media product could not be consumed en masse.  But from the point of view of distribution, this is a ‚Äúone-to-one‚Äù channel. <br>  With the development of print, mechanization and technology, it became possible to reach a large audience (newspapers, radio, TV).  This is the channel ‚Äúfrom mass to one‚Äù. <br>  We are currently returning to the Middle Ages, because once again we are moving to the channel ‚Äúfrom one to the mass‚Äù.  It is enough to cite as an example bloggers or how Americans increase the coverage area by sharing their home Wi-Fi hotspots.  These are phenomena of the same order.  But then there is some intrigue, because following the logic of the spiral development of history, we must once again come to the mainstream media.  Question: what kind of media will it be?  Those personally honed, about which I wrote above?  Or personal media class peer-to-peer?  Or will there be a functional separation of content producers, packers, distributors, filter makers? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/65742/">https://habr.com/ru/post/65742/</a></p>
