I will highlight three groups of people getting enough sleep, someone just sleeps a lot, others get ready for bed correctly, and still others use clever alarm clocks.  More recently, I have moved from the category of alarm clocks with sleep phases that do not get enough sleep in user groups.  A minimum of effort was spent on the move, it took only a free program for my android smartphone. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f96/a08/721/f96a08721213d4af9b362f2e06ca4130.png"><br>  <b>Upd.</b>  The owners of <u>iOS</u> and <u>Windows Phone 7.5 have</u> not been forgotten. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Sleep phases</b> <br>  Sleep is divided into two main phases, the fast sleep phase and the slow sleep phase.  In the phase of fast sleep, the human brain does not sleep at all, but rather intensively processes information, that is why we see dreams, toss and turn, and awakening at this moment will be almost painless.  During the night there are several cycles consisting of fast and slow sleep, while in the first 90-100 minute cycle, slow sleep prevails, and the phase of quick sleep may be absent.  In the next cycle, slow sleep becomes a little less long, giving way to fast sleep, which can last just a few minutes.  During the transition to the third cycle, the share of REM sleep increases significantly, and by the time sleep ends, REM sleep clearly prevails over slow sleep.  This is what all ‚Äúsmart‚Äù alarm clocks use. <br>  <b>Sleep as Android</b> <br>  I will not describe the standard features of many alarms, they are already known to everyone.  Sleep as Android features the ability to record sleep phases and ‚Äúsmart wake up.‚Äù  Therefore, immediately proceed to the description of my morning. <br><br>  I used this alarm for 10 days, with the last four days sleeping in different beds, the first one is hard, with a good mattress, the second one is hard to call a bed, a folding bed.  In both cases, I put the phone in different points of the bed and for five minutes I followed the graphs during my movements, wherever the device was located, the accelerometer confidently recorded all my movements.  From this we can conclude that the program has no special requirements for sleeping accommodation. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/31c/a7f/896/31ca7f896792ca1f0f9707c721ba3120.png"><br>  <i>You can go to sleep.</i> <br>  Thanks to the choice of the interval in which you allow yourself to wake up, you can optimally set the alarm for your sleep, choose the standard thirty minutes for yourself, usually the alarm goes off 10-20 minutes before the scheduled time, so that you can wake up more comfortably with pleasant music.  But you should not completely trust the ‚Äúsmart‚Äù alarm clock, if for some reason there is no REM sleep during the alarm, a pleasant melody is unlikely to wake you up.  This is where the second alarm clock comes to the rescue with an air-raid alarm and a matan captcha. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/47f/0f7/f59/47f0f7f59bd5efbf6c0056fd715130ca.png"><br>  <i>Variants of captcha, you can solve examples, shake the phone, catch a cheerful sheep or <a href="">run around the apartment in search of a QR code</a> .</i> <br>  If you manage to go to bed at your usual time, then with a 95% chance the smartphone will have time to catch the desired sleep phase, and you will immediately reach for the alarm off button.  At this point, the body will require continued sleep, but it‚Äôs rather laziness or physical fatigue, the brain usually wakes up in a working mood and does not require the traditional five minutes.  In this regard, you have to lie down for a couple of minutes ‚Äúwarming up‚Äù of the limbs, at this time you can think about the day to come, or what to do in the freed fifteen minutes.  For myself, I chose charging and reading the morning news, at home it is somewhat nicer than in a crowded minibus. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ef6/676/9a6/ef66769a66dcbf726679f6bf3a5903e1.png"></a> <br>  <i>Sleep graphics, statistics can be collected.</i> <br><br>  But not a fly in the ointment.  If there is a wife / husband / cat / dog besides you, they can wake up at six in the morning instead of you. <br>  <b>Battery consumption</b> <br>  Here we are waiting for the second spoon.  Most phones turn off the accelerometer during locking, so with high probability you have to keep the display on, which in turn warms the device and forces you to charge the phone throughout the night.  The lucky ones with an accelerometer that does not turn off during the lockout write about the consumption of 5-10% of the battery per night. <br>  <b>Pros and cons of Sleep as Android</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/046/2e6/505/0462e6505fe430ae35858867db001b05.png">  In 95% of cases it will help to wake up and start the day much easier. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/046/2e6/505/0462e6505fe430ae35858867db001b05.png">  Setting your own signal. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/046/2e6/505/0462e6505fe430ae35858867db001b05.png">  Increase and decrease in volume. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/046/2e6/505/0462e6505fe430ae35858867db001b05.png">  A rich selection of captcha to turn off the signal. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/046/2e6/505/0462e6505fe430ae35858867db001b05.png">  Record the phases of sleep. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/046/2e6/505/0462e6505fe430ae35858867db001b05.png">  Record snoring or muttering in a dream. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/046/2e6/505/0462e6505fe430ae35858867db001b05.png">  Dream analysis and detailed statistics on them. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/2e2/d67/5c2/2e2d675c2d45d1b5d20e490b4c26099a.png">  The need for an active screen for most smartphones. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/2e2/d67/5c2/2e2d675c2d45d1b5d20e490b4c26099a.png">  The need for constant charging during operation of the device. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/2e2/d67/5c2/2e2d675c2d45d1b5d20e490b4c26099a.png">  Manual start of the program, otherwise the ‚Äúsmart‚Äù alarm clock may not work. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/2e2/d67/5c2/2e2d675c2d45d1b5d20e490b4c26099a.png">  Does not work correctly for two. <br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br>  The conclusion is unequivocal, this is probably one of the most useful applications for a smartphone, and now I cannot understand how I did without it before, although only ten days had passed.
