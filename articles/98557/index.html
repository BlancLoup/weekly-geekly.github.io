      In Kharkiv, the already traditional, third in a row, mini-football tournament among representatives of the IT League technology industry is preparing to hold.  This time the tournament will be called ‚ÄúIT League 3.0‚Äù and, as it was before, will be held on the territory of the Children's Football Academy ‚ÄúMetalist‚Äù on fields with artificial turf under a real blue sky!  This fall, from September to November, those who know how to hold the mouse and what angle of the keyboard it is more convenient to rip the eye out of your opponent will come to life with a cup in a battle for life and life. <br><br>  During its short history, the tournament managed to catch the fancy of all the participants and their friends, who also took part in the football holiday, creating a truly football entourage from the podium!  What did the footballers not see enough for past tournaments: fans came with a drum and brought banners and chanters, and, not least, shouted them.  There were cases when almost one hundred people were hurting for one team (which is quite a huge audience for an amateur level and a rather limited place on the field), and it happened that only one cheerleader, but so long that she would remember entered folklore.  There were also numerous fans who supported not the whole team, but a separate player in it, who later became the champion. <br><br>  But the most important thing is the atmosphere of a football holiday and friendliness reigning around the tournament!  Recent rivals who did not spare each other on the field can already be seen sitting together over a cup of kvass.  At this time, future rivals, waiting for their match, sit in the stands and water those who are in the field so much in vain, then to go out themselves and not get into the empty net. <br><br>  Goal haircut, capture Polyakova-Litvin, "black and gray will be the first" - who do not understand what I mean, we invite you to immerse yourself in the bottomless world of the IT Football League this fall in Kharkov!  And those who understand do not need an invitation, because they themselves cannot do it without another portion of this aytiligovogo football drug!  Read more about the tournament on <a href="http://itleague.kharkov.ua/">the IT League website</a> . <br><br><h4>  A look into the past </h4><br><br>  The first tournament under the brand of IT-League was almost a year ago, in the fall of 2009, as <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/denis_in_ua/" class="user_link">denis_in_ua</a> <a href="http://denis-in-ua.habrahabr.ru/blog/81888/">wrote</a> . <br><br>  The second tournament took place already this spring and even captured a bit of summer, already 18 teams took part in it: <br><br>  <b>AKVELON</b> , <b>Altron</b> , <b>Ciklum</b> , <b>Echostar</b> , <b>Eclipse</b> , <b>EKTOS</b> , <b>EPAM Systems</b> , <b>Gameloft</b> (two teams), <b>GlobalLogic</b> , <b>GraceHoppers</b> , <b>INSART</b> , <b>Intetics</b> , <b>Muranosoft</b> , <b>NIX Solutions</b> , <b>ProfITsoft</b> , <b>Stella Systems</b> , <b>ZFort Group</b> <br><br>  Contrary to all forecasts, the winners were: ZFort Group - champions, GraceHoppers - silver winners and debutants INSART won the bronze. <br><br>  In addition to the text and photo reviews, video matches were added, both the video of the entire match and the clips with the most dangerous moments. <br><br>  Volunteer Denis Bratchuk from the ZFort Group also <a href="http://football.kharkov.ua/2010/06/05/it-prognoz-10-rezultatyi-vtorogo-dnya-finalnyih-igr">held a forecasters' tournament</a> , which was a stunning success and became an excellent "offline" component of the tournament. <br><br>  The constant information partner of the tournament - <a href="http://football.kharkov.ua/">the Kharkiv Futbolny</a> portal <a href="http://football.kharkov.ua/">has</a> become a haven for all IT legionnaires, in addition, it has also acquired a <a href="http://forum.football.kharkov.ua/">forum</a> . <br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br><br>  <s>In this laboratory work</s> With this brief post I wanted to tell you about this wonderful tournament and the wonderful organizers who volunteered to do such a good thing!
