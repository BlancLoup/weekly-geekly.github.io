A kangaroo wallaby with a baby in a bag has already walked three meters and wiggled her nose.  She was afraid and suspected something, but she wanted more carrots.  Then there were many more Australian adventures far from civilization, so I learned about the receipt of the book in the shops from the letters of readers.  It turned out that not only business owners need.  It was surprising. <br><br>  In short, it‚Äôs about telling stories.  More precisely, even this way: how to choose the most interesting stories in a working business (or another project), to submit them correctly, to fully gather facts and not to screw it up later.  The methodology is built precisely on ‚Äúnot to screw it up later,‚Äù that is, on verifying facts and very quiet work without hysterical screams.  It sells, and this channel of stories about its projects is called content marketing (the term appeared later than the same Fedor from Syktyvkar began to talk about his book business, but earlier than he started baking pizza).  Yevgeny Chichvarkin and Euroset vividly felt that something like that was needed - but he wanted to make a show about the work of the store, with the squeezing of suppliers, interviews, evil customers, inventories and other ups and downs.

      I gathered in a heap all that I wanted to tell you about how to write posts, collect information for them, how to convince on the site and so on and so forth.  But anyway, where there is a lot - the psychology of influence. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  What is this book about </h2><br>  <b>The first hefty part is about how and what to tell.</b>  The logic of the alignment of the system is as follows: if we take the desired result as an axiom (they know about you as a positive company far beyond the market), then you can begin to prove everything in the opposite direction - what to tell and how to tell.  And in this system of evidence, quite unexpected cutoffs will occur.  For example, in the response to a comment, it does not make sense to answer the person who asked the question (more precisely, how - it does not make sense to persuade him, the answer is meant for one person and another 5-10 thousand other people).  In writing, there should never be a negative - it is only verbally.  Because you can not understand, you can re-read, you can return in a year, you can quote, etc.  A long analysis of the reaction to different answers in the discussions gave rise to the mechanics of the answers to inadequate and competitors (a frequent task in the Runet) - where the usual logic does not help, a slight change in the form of the answer drastically changes the effect.  Remember how in the joke about the signalers, they say, the tower was built, now the headache in the whole village and the cockroaches are dying?  This is still garbage, after a week we will provide food.  Plus the form - why it is necessary to be short, clear and extremely specific. <br><br>  <b>The second part is about the work of a journalist within the company.</b>  I was once the editor of the Astrakhan children‚Äôs newspaper, and I also remember hardcore from experienced journalists.  We were chased for searching for objective information and evaluating different points of view as if not in ourselves.  Uncle Kara-Murza, who was giving a lecture on consciousness manipulation, traumatized my fragile childish psyche once and for all (I passed his baton in one children's robotics camp with a similar lecture, - the counselors still did not fully understand that when they chose ‚Äúhuman reproduction‚Äù and "social engineering" is the first safer).  In general, there is practical groundwork for what and how to do within the company. <br><br>  <b>The third part - for those who do not know how to write.</b>  There are short educational programs.  The part you could see on the Megamind (when he was still alive). <br><br>  In general, I hope that it turned out a useful thing for those who do not know what to write and what to write about their work.  Well, how to start it all and continue. <br><br><h2>  How was the edition </h2><br>  My letter  has been stolen from the whole book again.  Then, however, part returned, where the meaning was not enough. <br><br>  Proof-reader for some reason placed the stress in the words (but at the same time missed at least two typos).  It also upsets me a little, because every time I see a word with an accent, I want to read it the other way around - the brain decides that this is a non-standard version, and I need to delve into recognition.  Here is an example at the top of the page: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/b24/7f0/1ce/b247f01cea5a44909cc5fab760c1eeb3.jpg"><br><br>  Again, hell hyphenation, but I already know that in a few weeks the pirates will kidnap the book and fix everything in the fb2 format.  I will download and calm down.  Here is an example - it seems to be ‚Äúcompetent‚Äù, but counterintuitive.  Perhaps, of course, I somehow not so read: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/1e7/d00/e7a/1e7d00e7ae994bb7b7bb81b318ecec6a.jpg"><br><br>  The workflow itself went much faster.  When it is clear what and how to do, everything is very simple.  Long butted with the name.  I always laughed when I heard Yandex Evangelist (this is Bobuk, for example), but then I had to stop.  Because it turned out that there is nothing more concise in meaning.  The result is this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/968/ca2/6dc/968ca26dca4346c0ac22c9a4143761ce.png"><br><br>  LITredactor at MIF is beautiful.  This cute girl pounced on the text with the rage of a dragon, sending a bloody mess of edits.  Below is one page.  So, the whole book was exactly like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/852/c2a/7c4/852c2a7c455e4ca2b03302fe7127e9a6.png"><br><br>  I work in the same way with new writers, evoking a chilling set of impressions.  She cleaned my terrible spoken language, and I defended important constructs.  This time I managed to keep Russian spellings of many Anglicisms, hurray. <br><br>  Something like that.  <a href="http://www.mosigra.ru/Face/Show/lubit/evangelist_biznesa/">Here is the table of contents</a> and a couple more pages. <br><br>  Now some statistics.  According to the first book, ‚ÄúBusiness as a game,‚Äù the statistics are as follows: 17 thousand were sold in paper, a little less than 3 thousand times the book was purchased in electronic form and about 30 thousand times it was downloaded by pirates, it seems, mainly through the service Meil.ru Vkontakte (estimates are approximate, about pirates so generally with a finger to the nose).  Success criterion - 3 thousand copies per year on paper.  The criterion of direct-fire-bestseller - about 20 thousand copies per year.  They say that with books that are not tied to specific historical moments such as "Effective work in Windows 98" circulation over the years usually grow. <br><br>  The myth, by the way, it turns out, fiercely struggling with pirates, and there you can write whole adventure novels about it.  I suspect that their counterparty is able to lay out the sites of fraud, where the search offers to download the book for free, and instead of the file - a short demo of 33 pages or just a referral link to Ozone or something else.  But it is not exactly what they are.  It was necessary to sign something else about the removal from the exchangers, but I did not.  The surprise is that in exchange I wanted to update the file on Flibuste (there are typos).  It seems to me that only the natural politeness of the book people saved me from the phrase: ‚ÄúFlibusta?  What are you, in the end ohrenel? ". <br><br>  Next moment.  The book came to Ozone lower than the recommended retail price, that is, what the price we have, for example.  Or else where in the book.  There is a magic story in general - it seems that they automatically fell when the share of the search in the category increased: this is an excellent mechanic.  The publisher announces, and they are the ones who catch the whole effect.  We have, however, the word "Habrahabr" when ordering gives a discount, equalizing <abbr title="The discount is valid for all other products too.">chances</abbr> . <br><br>  Well, even from habrauda there were many questions how to show the book to the publisher.  It's simple: an approximate table of contents (then you can change it) and 10-15 pages (or one or two chapters, if they are large).  Already on this, the editor says, ok or not, and if ok, the final text is waiting.  This is much easier than writing a cycle of posts on Habr - so if you have something timeless without reference to the current software, you may need to prepare a little and ask. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/338374/">https://habr.com/ru/post/338374/</a></p>
