I present to your attention the translation of the <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/pa9nvv/the-blowjob-paper-scientists-processed-109-hours-of-oral-sex-to-develop-an-ai-that-sucks-dick-autoblow">article by</a> Samantha Cole from motherboard.vice.com. <br><br><h2>  Anonymous machine learning experts wrote an ‚Äúarticle about blowjob‚Äù to make this suction machine more realistic. </h2><br>  Autoblow AI, a penis user sex toy, consists of a rubber sleeve and an electric motor located inside the body and tries to imitate oral sex.  Her <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/autoblow-a-i-replicates-human-oral-sex-techniques">campaign on Indiegogo</a> was launched last week and quickly reached its target of $ 50,000.  Its main advantage over the previous model, Autoblow 2, released in <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/vdp7b8/the-autoblow-2-is-the-worlds-pre-eminent-robotic-oral-sex-simulator-for-men">2014,</a> is a machine learning algorithm that ‚Äúconstantly changes technique‚Äù to satisfy the user in new ways. <br><br>  Instead of repetitive, mechanical movements, this ‚Äúartificial intelligence mode‚Äù promises to reproduce the complex and unpredictable movements of a real, human blowjob.  To do this, the company asked a team of six people to review and annotate 109 hours of porn and hired machine learning specialists to create a model that processes this data and translates it into what the toy does.  All the work took three years. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The result of the study was the " <a href="https://www.autoblow.com/bjpaper/">Article about Blowjob</a> ", a study (obviously, not peer-reviewed), filled with sexual - or at least related to the sexual theme - algorithmic research: sex performed on men "- this is how the article begins.  ‚ÄúTo do this, we analyze a data set that contains more than 108 hours of pornographic video, each frame of which is annotated with the position of the lips on the penis stem.  We use the quantization technique to detect sixteen different movements, and using these movements, we develop and evaluate a system that procedurally generates realistic sequences of movements using deep learning.  We quantitatively show that this system is superior to simple methods based on Markov chains. ‚Äù

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ci/0h/-3/ci0h-37ix4bzmpggvfppjzbtkwa.png"><br><br><h2>  I had no problems with it </h2><br>  I asked Brian Sloan (Autoblow AI developer) about his attempt to hire serious scientists to work on a jerk.  His proposal was direct and devoid of hints: <br><br>  "I told them that I was developing a sex toy for men, recreating the sensations of a blowjob, and asked if they could use AI to study what actually happens during a blowjob so that my device can do blowjob as a person," - Sloan wrote me in an email.  ‚ÄúIt was enough for seven companies to tell me almost immediately that‚Äú this job is not for them. ‚Äù  When I asked why, they did not want to answer. ‚Äù <br><br>  The eighth team answered "yes", and wrote an "Article about the blowjob," for which she received, according to Sloan, $ 30,000.  But despite the excellent calculations and data collection methods, one thing is obviously missing from this study - the names of the authors.  There are no names in the article; research groups or institutions responsible for the work are not mentioned.  Scientists have performed work anonymously, because they believed that other clients may refuse to cooperate with them if this work becomes known. <br><br>  Sloane connected me with one of these anonymous scientists, using a special email address, so as not to disclose their data.  I also looked at the correspondence between Sloane and the scientists, documenting the progress in the work on the article where the names of the scientists were edited. <br><br>  "Brian found me on social networks ... probably Linkedin," the scientist answered me under an anonymous address.  ‚ÄúOur initial discussions did not concern sex toys and pornography.  They were technical, about video analysis and artificial intelligence.  He was quite frank in the fact that several teams refused to work on such a project.  I did not see any problems with this. ‚Äù <br><br>  The scientist who wrote the letter mentioned that he had a ‚ÄúPhD in AI‚Äù and more than 30 publications and patents.  The rest of the team is mostly engineers, he said. <br><br><h2>  Meet the Sliderman </h2><br>  The Blowjob Article begins with a few charts and graphs describing how researchers quantified movements from oral sex videos and transformed them into various movements offered by Autoblow.  Among them are cluster diagrams representing various actions, including pauses, orgasm control, head games and deep throats. <br><br>  Researchers have developed a dense neural network (DNN) architecture that predicts the next movement of a blowjob artist based on an analysis of previous movements, much like the predictive text input on your phone.  The article describes the process of creating these models like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kd/ta/tf/kdtatfxreaakqlngvgendws4o20.png"><br><br>  To collect this data, Sloan used the help of Dalibor Copic from Serbia.  Kopitsch works for Sloan's Very Intelligent E-Commerce Inc., a marketing company that has conducted other research on adult topics, including <a href="https://vaginacontest.com/">World's Most Beautiful Vagina competition</a> and <a href="https://ballscontest.com/">Balls Contest</a> .  Very Intelligent E-Commerce Inc.  very successfully <a href="https://www.vieci.com/media.php">covered</a> Sloan's crowdfunding campaigns for other products for adults <a href="https://www.vieci.com/media.php">in the press</a> , mentioning various "scientific" tricks.  Before the ‚ÄúBlowjob Article‚Äù, the same team wrote an ‚Äú <a href="https://vulvapaper.com/">Vulvar Article</a> ‚Äù for the Autoblow Beauty Contest. <br><br>  Kopich assembled a team of six people to extract data about blowjob from pornorolikov.  These were not specialists in statistics or machine learning, just friends and confidants wishing to help with an absurd task.  They created a system for annotating 109 hours of video about blowjob - only 1200 videos with oral sex - with the help of an animated hand-drawn head on the scroll bar, the position of which could be changed with the mouse while watching pornoroliki.  Kopich told me in an email that his head was called a Sliderman. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/b8/jn/xu/b8jnxuloligbueqdr7nvxnpxx64.gif"><br><br>  ‚ÄúWhen oral sex begins, and the girl does what she does, we move the Sliderman to repeat oral sex, and so we reproduce oral sex in our system,‚Äù Copic wrote to me.  They watched the video at half speed, and retrieved the values ‚Äã‚Äãfrom the scroll bar to collect the necessary data. <br><br>  I asked Kopich if he considered this work boring.  ‚ÄúTo be honest, I was lucky and unlucky :)‚Äù he said: ‚ÄúA few clips at the beginning of the project were interesting ... closer to the end it was probably a bit hard to watch.  So much oral sex ... " <br><br><h2>  Hi-tech </h2><br>  ‚ÄúIn fact, this is a rather interesting task,‚Äù said anonymous scientists who wrote the Article on Blowjob: ‚ÄúNow machine learning is experiencing its gold rush, and developers can choose which projects to engage in.  My job selection criterion is to find projects that are interesting and for which they pay well.  This project satisfies both conditions. ‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúIf they so openly wanted to work on automating the blowjob using AI, why remain anonymous?‚Äù I asked.  I was told that I contacted some of my clients and asked if participation in this work and public association with her would not be a problem. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe answer was amazing,‚Äù the scientists said: ‚ÄúCorporations do not want any connection with such things.  For them, this is unacceptable, and they see it as a PR nightmare.  Therefore, I remained anonymous.  At the personal level, I did not see disagreement, but at the corporate level this is considered a problem.  To understand the context - we work a lot with financial and government organizations.  We received a ban from them. ‚Äù <br><br>  No wonder.  Both <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/nz7b4k/how-sex-workers-get-paid">payment systems</a> and <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/qvxeyq/trump-signed-fosta-sesta-into-law-sex-work">lawmakers</a> show hostility towards sexual content. <br><br>  In addition to mathematics, this is an accessible and understandable example of how AI is embedded in everyday products, such as auto-completion of emails and Google search.  They study our past experience, and in theory Autoblow AI is no different.  He just learns from the example of pornography. <br><br>  Anonymous scientists also told me that the project was not fruitless for them.  ‚ÄúI realized that convolutional neural networks are very flexible, and the fact that AI can understand such a high-level idea as a blowjob is somewhat surprising.  I feel that we really use the most advanced technologies, using libraries that have not yet existed six months ago. ‚Äù <br><br>  Autoblow AI owes its existence to mathematics along with sweat, tears and the potential carpal tunnel syndrome of many people.  But in the end, despite all the statistics and machine learning, it's just a plastic can with a silicone sleeve, moving up and down the member.  Researchers imagine a world where interactive pornography and sex toys (and non-sexual entertainment too) can be improved using AI - but this will not happen all at once. <br><br>  ‚ÄúSex toys are available everywhere in developed countries.  Obviously, people want these things, and they will become smarter as scientists and engineers like me do their work, "they said to me:" This is a big picture.  There are, of course, purely technical improvements to the solution we have built for this particular sex toy, for example, the best procedural generation of the simulated blowjob, and other things besides the blowjob.  We found, for example, that anal sex is also recognized in this way. ‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/441252/">https://habr.com/ru/post/441252/</a></p>
