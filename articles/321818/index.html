About how we adapted the CMS "1C-Bitrix" under the new edition of the law, to make life easier for online stores, read under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Amendments to 54-FZ </h2><br>  In the new edition of the law, all companies are obliged to beat out cash checks and provide them to customers.  Except in some cases.  All data on settlements with customers should be automatically sent via the Internet to the CRF (Fiscal Data Operator).  This is an aggregator that accumulates data and transfers it to the FTS.  Today in Russia there are five certified OFDs.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/51b/437/88e/51b43788ef0e43a385f265b008d0916a.png"><br><br>  Earlier in cash registers there was a so-called EKLZ - memory in which all checks which were beaten out on this device were stored.  Now, instead of it, the FN is used - the fiscal drive.  It must be changed every 13 months. <br><br>  Cashier‚Äôs check must be made available to every customer.  And what about online shopping if they do not have direct contact with customers?  Now e-commerce has to send checks electronically. <br><br>  Online stores have printed checks before.  Few of them had cash transactions, and therefore did not issue cash vouchers at all.  But according to the amendments to 54-FZ, it is now necessary to print checks when paying by credit card or via e-wallets (Yandex.Money, WebMoney). <br><br>  Now checks are not needed only for bank transfers.  When an invoice is issued to a private client, he goes with him to the post office or to the bank and pays.  In all other cases, the check must be printed. <br><br>  This is a major change in the law.  Now the cash register is registered with the URL of the site.  The check must be stamped at the time of payment and it must list all paid goods. <br><br>  You can not just take and demand from all online stores to comply with the new regulations.  It will be implemented in stages. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4bc/6d8/072/4bc6d807241f434cb6d90f3374a50fc3.png"><br><br>  From July 1, 2017, it will be necessary to switch to new rules for the use of cash registers.  EKLZ memory someone may end earlier.  For such ‚Äúlucky ones‚Äù July 1 will come earlier: they will have to buy new cash registers - from February 1, old models with EKLZ will not be registered with the Federal Tax Service. <br><br>  By an early transition to the new regulations, you can be pushed not only by filling the memory of the cash register, but also by changing the name of the director, re-registering the location of the business, opening a new outlet.  All this is fraught with the urgent purchase of new cash registers: the new 54-FZ is obligatory to comply with all online stores. <br><br><h2>  Check Requirements </h2><br>  Also in the new law made more than 10 changes to the contents of the cash voucher. <br><br>  The most important thing - now you need to print all purchased goods.  Previously, it was possible to print only the total amount, and it does not matter when the receipt was stamped and for what product.  Now such liberties are not allowed. <br><br>  It is also necessary to indicate in the check: <br><br><ul><li>  VAT amount </li><li>  form of payment: bank card, electronic money, advance payment. </li></ul><br>  On the FTS website there is a huge document with the full text of the new law, and on the 99th page you can find seven exact requirements for cash vouchers.  Moreover, a specific set of features depends on the form of payment for a particular transaction. <br><br>  Another of the interesting innovations is the requirement for putting a QR code on the checks.  The client can receive this QR code either in a letter or on a real check, read it and see the full information about the check. <br><br>  The QR code specifies the check parameters: time, amount of the check, number of the fiscal drive, number of the fiscal document, fiscal sign, sign of the calculation (type of check).  QR codes are checked on checks by the special <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dru.fns.billchecker%26rdid%3Dru.fns.billchecker">program of the</a> Federal Tax Service ‚ÄúCheck Check‚Äù developed by GNIVTS JSC - by analogy with the programs of checking the excise stamps of the Unified State Automated Information System. <br><br>  The image of a check with a real QR code is equal to a legal document, that is, it is no longer necessary to have a paper original. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f3c/d2f/02c/f3cd2f02ce5b4f2a92e460602a379b4d.jpg"><br><br><h2>  New "1C-Bitrix" </h2><br>  Since version 17.0.1, we have implemented support for the requirements of the new 54- edition. <br><br>  Now you can use the free application ‚Äú1C-Bitrix.cashi‚Äù for computers to which cash registers are connected.  The application works on the server principle: it ‚Äúclings‚Äù to your online store, receives data from it and sends it to the cash register. <br><br>  He himself does not know how to initiate a connection, he can only receive some data (like a printer).  Accordingly, we need a certain intermediary who will receive data from the online store and print on this "printer". <br><br>  1C-Bitrix now supports Atol cash registers.  A little later, there will be support for Shtrih-M. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/50d/4e4/65b/50d4e465b0bc41b09f8106c07aee64cd.png"><br><br>  Atol has released a cash register without a printed block: by the way, if you are not working with offline clients, printing checks on paper is not necessary, it is enough to generate digital checks.  No printer - no problems with paper. <br><br><h2>  How to work with clients now? </h2><br>  Consider the procedure in the context of the changed legislation. <br><br>  <b>We receive from the client a cash register with support for 54-</b> .  At first, these are cars under the ‚ÄúAtol‚Äù and ‚ÄúShtrikh-M‚Äù brands. <br><br>  <b>The client enters into a data transfer agreement with the CRF</b> .  This is a very simple procedure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aea/0e4/ef9/aea0e4ef90854da5b60e46e2f6265ecb.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, you can start working with some CRFs without entering into a formal contract.  By law, it is considered that by sending the first data to this CRF, you will automatically conclude an agreement with the CRF. <br><br>  <b>The client registers the cash register in the FTS</b> .  Here is the quest more interesting.  On the FTS website there is a special section, to enter which you need to register and enter the key.  The key is issued separately and has no relation to the registration.  It acts as your digital signature.  If the client has a digital signature with which he can sign documents, then he will be able to register a cash register. <br><br>  Once logged in, he needs to select the cash register data, fill out the property form, select a model from the list and click the ‚ÄúSign with key‚Äù button. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/59d/d20/235/59dd20235d5a4985ba01d00c16ee0cb3.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/705/a91/b41/705a91b4170c4e17a5c3e858bc8294d8.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e5d/483/a5a/e5d483a5a5134f5b8efe88a870eebac5.png"><br><br>  Under the new law, it is allowed to receive money from different online stores at one cash register.  Suppose.  You have three online stores on different subdomains.  These are three separate ways to get money.  But.  Legal entity - one.  And the cash register can also be one. <br><br>  <b>Connect the cash register to the CRF</b> .  It is necessary to register certain parameters in the cash register.  Usually this is done by service companies selling cash registers. <br><br>  <b>Install / configure the cash register driver</b> .  Although there are drivers under Windows and Linux, but the 1C-Bitrix application: cash registers are for Windows only.  Drivers for Atol cash registers here: <a href="https://goo.gl/uVDRil">https://goo.gl/uVDRil</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2d0/1b1/c52/2d01b1c52dda4dc38b914b9920ced0a0.jpg"><br><br>  Why are two drivers indicated?  All cash registers with USB connection occupy two USB ports: one at a time they send data to print;  and on the second - on the Internet. <br>  That is, they emulate the system, ‚Äúprokidyvayut‚Äù data and send checks via the Internet to the CRF. <br><br>  Therefore, the first driver is the driver of the trade equipment itself, it is suitable for all Atol devices.  And the second driver is the second port emulation driver, which forwards the data to be sent to the CRF.  If you do not put it, the data will not fall into the CRF, and you will break the law.  Naturally, a channel is also needed to send data. <br><br>  After installing the second driver, you need to go to the folder, run the exe-file and specify the port that will be sent.  Since the cash register occupies two ports, it will be necessary to determine which of them to print and which to send. <br><br>  <b>Install the application 1C-Bitrix: ticket office</b> .  The installer is very simple.  After installation, you need to obtain authorization data on the site from the administrative panel of the site and enter it into the application.  Then the system will find the specific store itself, take the necessary data itself, get the authorization keys itself. <br><br>  <b>We adjust the cashier in "1C-Bitrix: Site Management</b> . <b>"</b>  ‚Äú1C-Bitrix‚Äù now supports three main scenarios of work: <br><br><ol><li>  <b>Automatic integration with cash registers</b> .  Designed for online stores that have cash transactions, but not 1C.  All cash transactions are emulated inside the product itself, that is, there is full work with the cash register inside 1C-Bitrix. </li><li> <b>Manual registration (backup script)</b> .  Suppose.  Your transaction is running, and suddenly the connection is broken.  You need to urgently register a check.  It could be printed, but did not register on the site.  This can be done manually inside the online store.  It is allowed to post operations ‚Äúreturn‚Äù (partially), ‚Äúknock out a new check with changes‚Äù, ‚Äúknock out a new check‚Äù and so on. </li><li>  <b>Integration with 1C in real time</b> .  Since the cycle is mixed (printing checks on a cash register from 1C and an online store), it is not necessary to install an additional application for online stores, 1C will take over its function.  It will raise the real-time channel, follow all changes on the site.  As soon as a check for payment is generated, it gets into 1C, and she already decides at which box office to print it.  It is enough to put a special driver for 1C and connect a cash register. </li></ol><br>  <b>Work on the new version of the law 54-</b> . <br><br><h2>  Cashier in the online store </h2><br>  In ‚Äú1C-Bitrix‚Äù a new section has appeared - ‚ÄúCash register of cash register machine‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/766/069/a9d/766069a9d8a2437eada06e130951e6d0.png"><br><br>  The ‚ÄúConnect CCM‚Äù button generates a registration URL, which must be entered in the application.  If you connect the cash register through 1C, then you do not need to configure anything. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/99e/1b1/a35/99e1b1a35f0b4a3fa4b16d6c0b354da4.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d46/39d/ed8/d4639ded829f4e28bf61143c270c87f7.png"><br><br>  After connection and registration all cash registers will be presented in the form of a table. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4f1/c0c/8b4/4f1c0c8b43bd406d921d39e0a97c711a.png"><br><br>  Why do we need a new section in the CMS? <br><br>  Unlike a traditional store, an online store cannot regulate a queue of customers.  If 10 people came to a regular store, they will not be able to make purchases at the same time and will line up.  Online store, unfortunately, does not work.  For example, you have launched a large advertising campaign, and customers are rapidly running.  10 people at the same time place orders and you have very little time to print checks. <br><br>  In this situation there are several solutions: <br><br><ol><li>  <b>Buffering checks</b> .  They will be printed in turn. </li><li>  <b>"Farm" of cash registers</b> .  You can connect several cash registers to one online store, and then you can automatically route checks, depending on the workload of the machines. </li></ol><br>  The second reason for creating a new section in ‚Äú1C-Bitrix‚Äù: to give an opportunity to indicate which cashbox a particular cash register belongs to.  One online store can be represented by several legal entities.  Suppose it is profitable for you to accept any payments on the IP.  You create a company inside 1C-Bitrix, connect a set of cash registers to it and say: ‚ÄúThis IP works with this set of cash registers, and here, LLC works with this set of payment instruments, it has its own set of cash desks.‚Äù <br><br>  After setting it is necessary for each cash register to specify the initial amount.  This is a one-time procedure.  There is such a thing as the amount of accumulation, it is printed on the checks of the z-report.  Since the cashier can not immediately start working with an online store, they usually knock out a small amount from 20 kopecks to 3 rubles.  It is used as a checkpoint when checking tax. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/483/72d/d79/48372dd798ea425abb9b59b8e0090104.png"><br><br>  Now the system displays a list of checks for the day, with the URL, amounts, orders, and so on.  An infinite number of checks can be attached to one order. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/97b/473/b56/97b473b56d094b0ebd54136941403f9b.png"><br><br>  Inside orders, there is a second option. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/311/f00/4ed/311f004ed4784caaaa300a019d2283d7.png"><br><br>  The scheme of registration of payment in the order a little more complicated.  The payment system confirms the passage of the payment, and the goods are sent for shipment.  Previously, this was done automatically, or the manager ticked the storekeeper to start collecting the order.  Now there are two such ticks.  The first tick says - electronic means of payment confirmed receipt of money.  The second check mark says - the check is stamped.  This also adds the URL of the check, at which the manager of the online store can see this check inside the CRF.  The same URL will be sent to the client by email. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/409/617/eab/409617eabb4c4a61975d5b17051c8d62.png"><br><br>  Z reports can be closed as manually: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cc3/37b/cdd/cc337bcddb404498b13442560822cbb0.png"><br><br>  ... and automatically.  During the closing of z-reports (up to 15 minutes) cashier‚Äôs checks cannot be printed.  After closing the reports, the new cash register shift can also be opened either manually or automatically.  If you have a mixed mode of operation - offline and online trading - it is better to close the z-reports during the physical closure of the cash register shift. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6f6/4f3/140/6f64f314035a444b9da69642028a15c8.png"><br><br><h2>  Attention to details" </h2><br>  As already mentioned above, one of the biggest inconveniences is the need to knock out a check at the time of settlement with the buyer.  It does not matter in what form the check will be - in paper or electronic form.  If your online store is open 24 hours a day, then the cash register should work during this time.  So do not forget to resolve issues with power supply and stable Internet access.  A lot of inconvenience is associated with a mixed mode of the store - ‚Äúonline offline‚Äù. <br><br>  How can 1C-Bitrix help to overcome all these difficulties? <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Check the availability of cash registers once a minute</b> .  If the PFC is not available at the moment, payment on the website will not be accepted.  The client chose the payment method, clicked "Checkout".  It is made out.  But here the redirect is performed not to the payment service page, but to the internal page of the online store (you can customize it): ‚ÄúExcuse me, at the moment the cash desk is not working, after a while you will receive a direct link and will be able to pay for the order.‚Äù  Such a scheme of work is useful in situations where the Internet is gone, when you have a z-report, and the cash desk is only one.  When the cash register goes online again, a direct authorization link is sent to the buyer.  He goes through it and pays the order. </li><li>  <b>Generating a queue of checks</b> .  Checks from this queue are distributed between cash registers that can be placed even in the office.  Up to four devices can be connected to one computer without serious consequences. </li><li>  <b>Preauthorization (blocking the required amount)</b> .  This is a way to bypass the limit of a few minutes.  But it is suitable only for payments on the card.  When placing an order, you can block the required amount on the customer‚Äôs bank card account.  Do not write them off, but only pre-block.  In this case, by law, you are not required to knock out a check.  You can safely check the availability of the goods, collect the order, ship it, and only after that give the command through the online store to write off the money with a receipt. </li></ul><br><h2>  Express delivery </h2><br>  As we said above, the receipt should now list all the goods purchased as part of the order.  Therefore, when the courier goes to the customer, he should have a current catalog of your online store on the cash register.  That is, we must now maintain synchronization of online stores with cash registers.  But since they work through COM port emulation, uploading a catalog, say, to 100 thousand positions, takes a lot of time. <br><br>  But there is a second option.  The courier in the morning picks up the batch of orders that need to be delivered today, and not the entire catalog is synchronized at the cash register, but only the checks he has to knock out.  If, for example, the customer does not take all the items from the order, the courier simply removes the remaining items from the check and prints it.  The check is fiscalized, sent to the CRF, and a paper printout is given to the client.  However, such a scheme of work is not supported by all cash register models, so check whether your device allows you to edit checks. <br><br><h2>  Sending a check electronically </h2><br>  Since online stores usually do not interact with customers directly, to send them checks in electronic form, you must receive an email address or a mobile phone number from clients.  In 1C-Bitrix, only email is supported.  When a new event is created - ‚Äúcheck of cash register‚Äù - a letter with a QR code and a URL to the page with complete check data is automatically sent to the client. <br><br><h2>  Possible scenarios of financial calculations </h2><br>  The latest edition of Law 54-FZ describes seven possible scenarios.  In the previous edition there were four of them: income / consumption, take / return under the report.  Accordingly, all the chains of checks that you create will correspond to these scenarios. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b4b/061/7ed/b4b0617edcf64d2c968dcaa62df8c2de.png"><br><br>  <b>Note</b> : a new set of scenarios is supported only in new firmware of cash registers, so when purchasing, check the firmware version. <br><br>  Let's look at some of the possible situations in life and the algorithms of our actions. <br><br>  <b>The first scenario</b> : an order is issued for three goods, paid by card, one of the goods is missing.  The client asks to replace with another product.  But you have already received the money and cleared the check for three goods, and the desired replacement is not available.  The client says: ‚ÄúGive me two T-shirts, and return the money for the third.‚Äù  In this case, you will need to create the following chain: <b>check with goods on order (stamped) - return check (need to knock out) - new check with actually shipped goods</b> .  That is, you will need to knock out three checks, which must be spelled out the correct operation. <br><br>  <b>Let's take the scenario more complicated</b> : an order is issued for three goods, paid for with a card, one of the goods is missing.  The client asks to leave money for the missing goods on the internal account, and ship the remaining goods.  In this case, the chain of creation of checks will be as follows: a <b>check with goods - a return check - a new check with goods minus the missing one - a check marked ‚ÄúAdvance‚Äù</b> . <br><br>  Subsequently, when the customer buys the goods on the check "Advance", you will pick out the <b>closing check, which will be written "In expense of the advance</b> . <b>"</b>  The amount on this check will not be registered with the Federal Tax Service, that is, there will be no double counting of funds. <br><br>  <b>Another scenario</b> : an order is issued for three goods, paid in full, but the store does not have all the goods in stock, the customer agrees to be shipped in parts.  In this case, the check chain will be as follows: a <b>check marked ‚ÄúAdvance‚Äù - a check with a specific shipment marked ‚ÄúConsidering an advance‚Äù (and the check contains only those goods that you shipped) and so on, until the entire closing chain of this order</b> .  In such a situation, the sequence of shipment should be determined by people.  Not a system. <br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  Let's sum up. <br><br><ul><li>  "1C-Bitrix: Site Management" from version 17.0.1 is fully consistent with the new edition of the law 54-FZ </li><li>  Supports unlimited number of cash registers for online stores </li><li>  There is a distribution function of checks among several cash registers in the event of an increase in the load on the store </li><li>  The entire business chain is supported: from opening a cash register shift to registering checks, to closing a cash register shift and generating z-reports </li><li>  Check-backs are supported. </li><li>  A free Windows application for online stores is provided, but it only works with version 17.0.1. </li><li>  The shop can work 24 hours a day.  The main thing is to have power supply and Internet on the computer to which the cash register is connected. </li><li>  Automatic check queue and buffering are supported. </li><li>  A different number of legal entities in one store is supported.  This can be one legal entity for several stores, or several legal entities for one store. </li></ul><br><br>  All detailed information, FAQ on frequently asked questions, as well as a subscription to newsletters with updates - <a href="http://kassy54fz.ru/">here</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/321818/">https://habr.com/ru/post/321818/</a></p>
