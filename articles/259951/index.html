  <section class="page js-page"><h1>WWDC15. The first day. Keynote</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The first reaction to the Keynote of any conference - be it Google I / O or WWDC - ‚Äúeverything was expected, nothing revolutionary.‚Äù  This can often be heard both from developers and from people who know little about technology and require products that will immediately impress them.  Yesterday, in the course of keynote, we saw several announcements that would set the tone for the development of Apple products for next year, but many complain about the lack of a new Apple TV, boring features and other nonsense. <br><br>  I am here and I see that the developers of such skepticism or pessimism are not observed, so let's go in order and independently figure out what is cool and what is not. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8a0/a69/096/8a0a6909616640b398c2f02459886a00.JPG"><br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  <b>Mac OS X El Capitan</b> </h4><br><ul><li>  In the system with a funny name, fundamentally new differences were not noticed.  Nevertheless, as always, we were promised ‚Äúfaster, more stable, more convenient‚Äù about almost all the components. </li><li>  System applications have received small but nice updates.  <b>Notes</b> , for example, will finally allow ordinary users to abandon the order of slowing down and overloaded Evernote.  Everything is cute, beautiful, functional.  Apparently, they were altered almost from scratch. </li><li>  <b>Spotlight</b> search works throughout the system (it already was) and is similar to Google (this is new).  Able to search for photos according to circumstances (hello, Google Photos), documents by content and filters, on the Internet and using widgets. </li><li>  The window manager has become even cooler.  <b>Split Screen</b> mode is a class.  And, most importantly, everything is intuitive and understandable, the grandmother will understand.  Mac OS X is still on top - everything is fast, smooth, neat.  And filled with such trifles, to which you quickly get used to and without which there is nowhere else.  Who uses, knows. </li><li>  The speed promised is even higher than before.  This also applies to the performance of the system itself (and most importantly, battery life), and the performance of applications with complex graphics.  <b>Metal</b> came on Mac OS, and this is a bonus for game developers and tool makers.  Adobe says their braked applications are now flying.  And Unity, Unreal Engine and other engine manufacturers already support everything.  Perhaps in the future, based on Mac OS, Apple will make a console, which everyone is talking about, but no one has seen (there was just a myth about the new Apple TV with games, which has not yet been confirmed). </li><li>  Many features that appear in Mac OS X are simultaneously available on iOS or vice versa.  It seems that these platforms have a much closer future than they might seem. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/60d/c9f/577/60dc9f5776344a50b35da9a9d3ae5b4c.JPG"><br><br><h4>  <b>iOS 9</b> </h4><br><ul><li>  The main news for the platform is <b>Intelligence</b> and <b>Proactivity</b> .  If last year all the components and applications of the system were combined into a dense ecosystem, now they are trying to make this ecosystem proactive and smart.  Siri now knows about the context in which the user and his device are located.  Depending on this, she can tell whom to call or where to go.  This functionality almost one-to-one repeats just updated Google Now.  I do not know who stole anyone from there, but in any case it‚Äôs good for us. </li><li>  iOS can now index applications and offer <b>deeplink links</b> to users throughout the system.  For example, in the search: if Siri sees that it is dinner time, you can immediately go to Wikipedia or a culinary application with a potato recipe, and the recipe will open immediately. </li><li>  Apple Pay merged with Passbook and renamed it <b>Wallet</b> .  Everything is the same there, but in more countries and shops. </li><li>  Unsuccessful navigation service <b>Apple Maps</b> everyone is trying to run.  This time they added foot navigation and public transport.  Attempts are still rather weak. </li><li>  Announced a new application <b>News</b> .  This type of existing platform Newsstand, only with interactive and smart tips.  Nice, but what we have not seen there. </li><li>  The iPad is new.  Finally waited <b>multitasking</b> .  That is, you can immediately open two applications, just like on the desktop.  Updated keyboard: it became more convenient to edit large amounts of text.  Of course, the tablet is more and more attractive for business users, it becomes a competitor to a small MacBook itself, and this trend, apparently, cannot be stopped. </li><li>  Many, many new things have been announced in the frameworks (HomeKit, GameplayKit, ReplayKit), but this topic will not be revealed in a day.  We will keep our finger on the pulse. </li><li>  The company is very proud of the penetration of its mobile system (83%, Karl!).  This has a good effect on security and on application support by developers.  The new version of the system will generally support all the same devices that are currently running on iOS8.  Previously, some of them have always been left behind in every update, but the policy has clearly changed. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9d7/270/590/9d72705908cc4f33bbb1a3bf0f3eedbc.JPG"><br><br><h4>  <b>Swift 2</b> </h4><br>  Apple continues to actively promote its (and very successful, by the way) language to the masses.  In the near future it will be transferred to open source.  This means that the code of all compilers and standard libraries will become available, but most importantly, the license will now allow you to write your own. <br><br><h4>  <b>watchOS 2</b> </h4><br>  The most rich in updates direction - <b>Apple Watch</b> .  In fact, they did everything that the public asked for: the native SDK, work without a phone, direct connection to the network, direct access to hardware, and much more.  As in the case of the first iPhone, the piece of iron was quite good right away, and the possibilities open gradually.  Details will be revealed during the week, so there is no complete clarity yet.  But the expectations are quite heated. <br><br><h4>  <b>Apple Music</b> </h4><br>  Apple now has its own spot.  Well, nice :) <br><br>  But this is the lyrics - in the following reviews we will tell about what was interesting at the session of <i>Platforms State of the Union</i> and other Apple events for developers.  Stay tuned! <br><br>  The second part of the story about WWDC: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/redmadrobot/blog/259975/">WWDC15</a> is already available <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/redmadrobot/blog/259975/">.</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/redmadrobot/blog/259975/">Second day.</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/redmadrobot/blog/259975/">Details</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/401/880/5f3/4018805f313f49399b7e19d051956f36.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/259951/">https://habr.com/ru/post/259951/</a></p>
