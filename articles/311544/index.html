The first edition, by the way, is still being actively sold and, in every second book on UX there is a link to it.  It first came out back in 1997 and, unlike most other books, is almost not outdated, as it is not about technology, but about deep study of people. <br><br>  The new edition has been completely rewritten, it has become thicker by 100 pages, and it adds support for CoolConcept, which Karen has been doing in recent years.  Namely, she found out what factors make the product cool in the eyes of users.  The book also includes the experience of using Contextual Design in real projects over the past 18 years.

In order for the modern world to successfully fit into a dynamic production process, and the company could work in the market vigorously, updating products and offering new ones, you need to take care of three things - the team, leaders and culture.  The design workflow is also important, but it has become a hygienic requirement - it is an indispensable, but far from sufficient condition for a strong design team.  It must and must be thought out.  But for success, shared values ‚Äã‚Äãare more important.  <a href="http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2016/09/applied-ux-strategy-part-41-from-design-team-to-design-culture.php">English version</a> (split into two publications). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"> <a href="http://www.jvetrau.com/uxstrategy-4/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6f6/575/3fc/6f65753fc999b7e5dcc6301119cb226f.png" alt="UX-strategy in practice.

Sasha Korolkova, art director of ParaType, considers the development of the Cyrillic alphabet and the expansion of the horizon of font users to be an important task.  Unfortunately, today there are quite a few Cyrillic fonts designed for actual practical tasks, and an interface font designed specifically for the Russian language is very necessary. <br><br> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/gov.design/photos/a.276701172474033.1073741828.241774232633394/928829267261217/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6aa/a0e/fba/6aaa0efbaf0c9170a983e59c57e6206e.png" alt="Font for state" width="780" height="504"></a> <br><br>  Sasha suggested just such a seemingly unobvious font design.  The task was to create a serious, but as friendly as possible visual environment, so we have a humanistic grotesque, close to the Dutch fonts.  Typically, these fonts are used for printing, rather than the screen, so the image needed to be adapted for interfaces.  First, the font proportions are narrowed, the letter spacing and the growth of lowercase characters are enlarged, and the remote elements are as short as possible, which is typical for fonts of this designation.  Round signs are slightly engraved to increase the amount of white inside and make the letters look larger.  The font has retained its compactness and is suitable for typing large arrays of text / documentation, but it does not ‚Äúblacken‚Äù on the screens of small devices.  This purpose is served by subtle combinations of strokes and subtle strokes in the center of complex letters, for example, ‚Äúc‚Äù and ‚Äúz‚Äù.  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/gov.design/photos/a.276701172474033.1073741828.241774232633394/928829267261217/">The team is interested in your opinion</a> . <br><br><h2>  Conference proceedings </h2><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2016/09/review-ux-strat-2015-part-3-conference-highlights-day-1.php">UX STRAT 2015</a></strong> <br>  Report on the first day of presentations of the UXSTRAT conference, which took place on September 8-10 in Athens, Georgia (USA).
