  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Dawn of grid society</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today I read several interesting articles on the web. <br>  There is a feeling that until the epoch that can be called the ‚ÄúDawn of Grid-society‚Äù, there is much less time than I personally expected. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Here is the first article. <br>  <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/article/1803">Social network as a weapon</a> <br><br>  What do I think after this article?  And the fact that the model of human relations is slowly but steadily spreading into the virtual sphere.  Since the management of relations in social networks is much easier, then the formation of these networks will continue to be similar to the crystallization process: a small core (seed) causes the rapid dissemination of information about the community through a formless environment ("cloud of connections"), after which who is closest to the ‚Äúcore‚Äù in some ways.  By joining, they will activate the ‚Äúclouds‚Äù connected to them until they cover all the available relationships (ideally, of course).

      On the other hand, it seems that in this area a critical mass of transfers is growing.  A little more - and it will reach the level of self-maintenance due to the generation of benefits with available resources and the commercialization of these benefits. <br><br>  This is the first step in the grid: applications are already ‚Äúdistributed‚Äù, the channels are wide enough, money (that is, resources) in this environment is quite enough, the grid infrastructure (algorithms of its work) is laid. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.webplanet.ru/news/soft/2006/11/24/msg.html">The war of openness against closedness is growing stronger</a> <br><br>  And this article shows what the second step of the grid-society will be.  After all, if the code is open, then it can be modified, including another code that is executed in a certain place / set of places.  Cyberspace loses its consolidation and hierarchy, becoming much more mobile and susceptible to "mutations." <br><br>  Then it will be enough to run one program that is capable of self-improvement in the infrastructure of the grid, with the condition that its perfection is directly proportional to the utility (measured by the number of calls to the appropriate subprogrammes) ... After some time, a network of programs will be formed on the grid network right now, in an improved version.  They will share experiences and explore the environment!  Well, that is, the grid and the processes occurring in it. <br><br>  This is, in fact, a solution to the task of creating Artificial Intelligence.  If intellect is the ability to set and solve problems, then this software will undoubtedly be capable of it. <br>  Moreover, if the intellect exists in dynamics (there are new tasks - there will be I., there are no new tasks, all tasks have already been solved - I. loses its qualities) - then everything turns out smoothly: we will continuously ‚Äúthrow‚Äù new grid software puzzles. <br><br>  Consequently, it will be a self-developing environment with a pace of life many times greater than the biological one.  Their evolution will take years.  Then they will start to overtake us ... if there are enough chips :) And this is a guarantee of cooperation. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.cnews.ru/news/line/index.shtml%3F2006/10/10/213357">Network changes policy (E. Schmidt)</a> <br><br>  Well, in this article it is clear that this sphere has also affected politics.  If you recall ‚ÄúChasing Bush!‚Äù, Mob actions on the Web, spam-fever and buzz-passes of various ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù baubles (like ‚ÄúPreved!‚Äù, ‚ÄúI just posted abyavu!‚Äù And so on), it is clear that more joking - the denser the infrastructure of the future grid enters there.  Therefore, politicians will enter there quickly ... but they will change irreversibly, because the grid does not allow to lie even now.  What will happen when the neural interface appears? <br><br>  Wait and see... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/848/">https://habr.com/ru/post/848/</a></p>
