  <section class="page js-page"><h1>REG.RU launched a free service "Domain Testament"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/604/720/b81/604720b81a9ae407222145b235f84cf4.png" align="left">  If you believe the rating and the date of publication of the post " <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/55069/">The right to inherit domain names in RU'net,</a> " the topic of domain inheritance was of interest to habrovchan four years ago.  Many developers do not have the ability to register domain names for a legal entity and are forced to worry that, in the event of their untimely death, the fruits of their labors will fall to the middlemen. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  The other day, REG.RU registrar launched a free service that can save developers from having to worry about it: <div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Copy of service announcement from the official site REG.RU</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><blockquote>  REG.RU announces the commencement of the provision of a unique service for inheriting domain name rights.  Now the domain administrator will be able to specify in advance the user to whom the domain name will be transferred in the event of his death. <br>  Up to this point, there was no service in the Russian market that allows you to determine in advance the user to whom the domain right will transfer after the death of the administrator.  Most often, registrars decide to delegate rights to a domain name to a heir after the fact, that is, after submitting a death certificate for the domain administrator and documents confirming the right of inheritance. <br>  The new free REG.RU service allows you to significantly simplify this process and, moreover, to avoid possible disputes between the registrar and the heirs.  Indeed, according to the current legislation, the registrar has the right to cancel the registration of the domain name immediately after receiving irrefutable evidence of the death of the administrator. <br>  Now all the REG.RU clients can bequeath the domain name to a specific individual.  For this, the domain administrator must sign the ‚ÄúAgreement on the transfer of domain name administration rights in the event of the administrator's death‚Äù and indicate in it the name and contact details of the future heir.  You can familiarize yourself with the text of the agreement and the terms of service provision on the REG.RU website in the Legal Services section. <br>  The right to administer a domain is a service, therefore, in current practice, it is not classified as a property and is not included in the estate.  However, a legal precedent occurred quite recently - the bailiffs seized domain names belonging to a resident of the Moscow region to pay the debt.  It can be assumed that due to the exponentially growing cost of domains in the secondary market (for example, in 2010, the domain 2014.ru was purchased for 2.5 million rubles, and the cost of the ad.ru domain in 2013 was 6 million rubles) their ownership will be extended to other types of legal relations. <br>  ‚ÄúDomains are becoming an increasingly valuable asset and more and more questions arise about the possibility of domain names inheritance.  After all, a domain name can be registered for network addressing not only the user's personal blog, but also the website of his company.  In such circumstances, the cancellation of the domain name registration can lead to the blocking of the site, and, consequently, to losses and lengthy legal proceedings.  In order to avoid such cases, we run the domain inheritance service.  Now REG.RU clients will be able not only to protect their assets, but also to save their heirs from a headache in the future, ‚Äùsays REG.RU CEO Alexei Korolyuk. <br>  <a href="https://www.reg.ru/company/news/2859">Link to this news on the official website of the registrar</a> </blockquote></div></div><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">An excerpt from the REG.RU FAQ, explaining the algorithm of the procedure</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><blockquote>  <b>1.6.4.</b>  <b>Service "Domain Testament"</b> <br>  To ensure that in the event of the death of the domain name Administrator, the right to administer the domain has been transferred to a specific person, the Administrator may conclude with REG.RU an Agreement on the transfer of domain name administration rights in the event of the death of the Administrator.  The conclusion of the Agreement implies that after the death of the Administrator, the registration of the domain name will be canceled and the domain will be registered for these persons specified in the Agreement as a future Administrator. <br>  To conclude the Agreement, the Domain Administrator must come to the REG.RU office personally with a passport for personal identification.  If the Agreement is sent by mail, an Application must be attached to it, the signature of which must be notarized.  We pay your attention that it is necessary to notarize only a signature on the application.  The agreement is not authenticated. <br>  After receiving the duly executed Agreement, REG.RU will notify the person indicated as a future Administrator within 7 days of the cancellation and registration of the domain in the event of the death of the Domain Administrator. <br>  To register a domain for its data after the death of the Administrator, the future Administrator must submit to REG.RU a statement on the cancellation of the domain name with its subsequent registration, as well as a notarized copy of the Administrator‚Äôs death certificate.  An application with a copy of a notarized document must be submitted no later than 30 days after the death of the Administrator.  If the Application is sent by mail and not provided personally by the Future Administrator to the office of REG.RU, then it must be notarized. <br>  Cancellation of registration and registration of the domain for the data of the Future Administrator is made within 3 working days from the moment of receipt of the full package of documents provided by the Future Administrator of the REG.RU company. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.reg.ru/docs/heritage_agreement.doc">Agreement</a> <br>  <a href="https://www.reg.ru/docs/heritage_statement.doc">Application for the conclusion of the Agreement</a> <br>  <a href="https://www.reg.ru/docs/heritage_registration_statement.doc">Application for cancellation of the domain in the event of the death of the Administrator</a> <br><br>  <a href="https://www.reg.ru/support/help/">A source</a> </blockquote></div></div>  <i>Unfortunately, due to lack of karma, I can not post the news in the hub ¬´Dura Lex¬ª.</i> <br>  I bring to your attention a number of polls, perhaps your answers will help other registrars decide on the reaction to the introduction of the "Domain Testament" service by the registrar REG.RU. </div>
