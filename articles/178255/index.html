The article has nothing to do with Jim Collins‚Äôs Good to Great book.  Although I advise everyone to read it. <br><br>  On some site I saw a picture revealing the process of creating products.  It can be expressed in words as follows: prototype creation - testing - adjustments - product release - feedback - refinement. <br><br>  In reality, on the Russian market, everything looks approximately as follows: product release - op b% i - adjustments - product out - well% ty - adjustments - product out.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Even the ideal, in the opinion of the source, the process of creating a product has significant shortcomings: <br><br>  1. <b>Before creating a prototype,</b> you need to answer the question ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù That is, what need will our product satisfy.  And here, friends, lies the first and most important secret of success.  Thinking about the needs of customers before creating a product, you significantly reduce the risk of failure.  Why?  Therefore, you know for sure that this product will be in demand: there is either explicit or implicit demand.  So the number of ‚Äúblind spots of failure‚Äù is significantly reduced. <br><br>  For example, now many create online stores.  And even more is taught.  As a result, 99.99% of these online stores will close, meeting with real competition.  Why?  Because many believe (because they are taught this) that an online store is a sales channel.  So, everyone who thinks so is dedicated: an online store is a separate project with its own positioning and marketing strategy, and not just a showcase.  And he, too, must close a specific need, and not just sell China. <br><br>  2. The second question arises from the first (although very often the opposite happens and it is even good) For whom is this product?  That is, who will consume it (buy)? <br><br>  For example, when creating products for children under 6 years old, you must understand that parents are real consumers.  And you will have to take into account their wishes when creating your product.  By the way, it is desirable to know your consumer personally, in person and as best you can.  This will significantly increase your chances of creating a truly useful product, as well as open up new opportunities and needs of the target audience. <br><br>  3. If you are going to create an outstanding product, then before proceeding to points 1 and 2, you need to answer the question ‚ÄúWhy should I create any products at all?‚Äù That is, you should have an <b>idea</b> that you invest in your business . <br>  What's the point?  Most people make decisions intuitively, emotionally.  And if you bring your idea to them, then there is some chance that they will be imbued with it.  And, attention, now they will buy, not because you have a quality product, but because "You are the same as they."  Someone from our team said: "Outstanding products are not on the production lines, but in the heads of consumers."  Remember this.  By the way, it is very easy to influence the heads if you know how. <br><br>  For example, Apple.  It is proved that when iphone holders are asked about their brand, they activate the areas of the brain responsible for religion.  (Roger Dooley "Neuromarketing").  This can be achieved with your product, but you have to put in an ‚Äúidea‚Äù.  In marketing there is a tool that tells how - the mission of the company. <br><br>  Many technical experts argue with me that the quality of the product is paramount.  Friends, by no means.  Above all the expectations of the person regarding the quality of the product.  (Note of the author. "But God forbid you to create Kaku!") <br><br>  4. Do you have an idea why it costs to become your customers;  You have a clear understanding of the need that your product will satisfy, as well as a complete idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwho will buy.  Bravo!  By my own estimates, this is 90% success.  Things are easy - to create a product.  After which it will be necessary to open a new 100% :) <br><br>  PS By the way, from my colleagues from IT I constantly hear such a comment: ‚ÄúAgile!  We must first create a prototype, and then test it and modify it already: speed is the most important thing. ‚Äù  I specifically asked about the reasons for the failure of IT start-ups.  The third most important reason was ‚Äúthe lack of demand [I would say they could not sell]‚Äù. <br><br>  In short, what was required to prove.  By the way, on the first one - ‚Äúthe team‚Äôs non-professionalism‚Äù, on the second - ‚Äúburned out‚Äù. <br><br>  I would be glad if you express your thoughts on how to create outstanding products, including in the IT market. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/178255/">https://habr.com/ru/post/178255/</a></p>
