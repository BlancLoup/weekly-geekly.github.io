  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Laptops, Linux and [censored]</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Not so long ago, I decided that I needed a laptop.  And once decided - it means it is not a sin to accomplish.  After evaluating his purchasing power, he made a credit card, took a couple of orders for a house in order to quickly cover the loan and proceeded to the elections.  Elections lasted a long time - half a week, during which the brain, even in dreams, shoved pictures of laptops into dreams.  I can not say that it was very nice, but nonetheless. <br><br>  As a result, the laptop was purchased.  As one of my familiar admins put it, ‚Äúshit is a normal workhorse‚Äù (exact quote).  In general, I agree with him.  When choosing, the task was to acquire a laptop, which in the course of the next couple of years would allow myself to feel comfortable with the web developer, which I, like, am.  Accordingly, when choosing one, the main emphasis was placed on the build quality / price. <br><br>  Unfortunately, in spite of the fact that I originally wanted a laptop with a matte screen, I pragmatised the pragmatism and bought a laptop with a glossy screen.  I think I will scold myself more than once about this - I remember how I didn‚Äôt like to watch movies at 5 pm 4 years ago, when the sun was shining directly into the CRT monitor.  I'm afraid that here I will have similar problems.  Waiting for sunny days to check :)

      In the evenings, after work, I have been trying to adjust and realize the possibilities of my new laptop for almost a week.  The main problem, as is usually the case with laptops, does not start Wi-Fi.  Along the way, I caught myself thinking that I wanted to be able to control the speed of rotation of the cooler.  Having spent on it two evenings, but not having achieved the result, I postponed it for the future. <br><br>  Now I‚Äôm thinking - what if I don‚Äôt rebuild the core from the freshly installed system?  Despite the fact that I put debian there, and not gentoo, I think this can be beneficial for the running time and overall performance.  I don‚Äôt know, really, why I may need performance on a laptop, but if I can get it, why not try? <br><br>  In conclusion.  I want to make the main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis post for all to see.  There are people (like me) who like to dig in the guts of a piece of iron.  Optimize, customize, force non-working hardware to work, raise dead software, etc.  It seems to me that for this you need to have a special upbringing, a special mindset ... * nix - the systems quite tightly respond to the casts of people like me.  For us, this is not hard work, but rest.  Despite the fact that it takes a week to fully raise the system, and not a couple of hours, it brings satisfaction. <br><br>  :) <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> Not in the salt, that you can buy some kind of laptop, put some kind of operating system on it, so that it ‚Äúworks everything except for something right out of the box‚Äù.  I just tried to express my feelings from the vision of the world in the context of picking with software and hardware, which is called for fun. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/20530/">https://habr.com/ru/post/20530/</a></p>
