For example, sailors often go to those ships where there is a connection and entertainment, and not just a good salary.  But here we decided to look for a ‚Äúbetter meadow‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/806/961/83b/80696183b768d32212634378a43c156b.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/968/5aa/12b/9685aa12be5750f331dd839ff71a8db7.jpg" alt="image">

Otradnoe and m.Altufevo.  Everybody got used to it, people rented apartments to get closer, so we decided to keep this territorial identity.  However, the industrial area in which the Virtuozzo office used to be was not particularly pleased.  The team just took it for granted. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/97f/9a6/13d/97f9a613dcf746e6bd6d0316bdda4a8a.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b03/613/415/b03613415a52342cb71d92f12a349573.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Shortly before the New Year, we moved to the ‚ÄúOtradnoe Technopark‚Äù business center (it was long known to everyone to open it, because the mayor of Moscow participated in it).  Now, pedestrians can comfortably get from the subway, just ten minutes, and motorists can comfortably drive up to the technology park from the Altufevskoe highway and from the Prospect Mira.  Sometimes employees work from home, the company allows it.  Although the new room, specially designed and decorated in pleasant bright colors, is almost as cozy and comfortable as an apartment. <br><br>  <b>The very first</b> <br><br>  We drove into the building one of the very first and at first received a generally bare room, where it was necessary to cover the ventilation, make partitions and generally decide what our new office would look like.  Maybe not even all employees saw the first photos of our today's "home" <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/238/01e/a82/23801ea825a1e74539a63bb19c39c2c2.png" alt="image"><br><br>  We carefully chose all the elements of decor and design, so that everyone was nice and comfortable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/983/c37/bb6/983c37bb6fe871ee35c911e7bfc43534.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The division of the office into zones took place gradually and only after a detailed analysis of what exactly the different teams of our team need.  Someone needed a separate office, for others - to create OpenSpace with comfortable working conditions. <br><br>  That's how it looked at the very beginning. <br><br>  Yes, now few people recognize in these concrete structures the look of our cozy office! <br><br>  <b>Infrastructure special campus</b> <br><br>  We saw reports on how Google or Yandex engineers live and work: large, beautiful rooms, bright posters and toys, a free schedule. We are, of course, not Google, but in the Otradnoe Technopark we have much more opportunities for leisure and recreation.  We are creating an intelligent microclimate on a territory of several hectares together with other companies-neighbors.  The entrances and parking areas are guarded, a special sensor is installed on all cars that can read barriers: you can only drive through your own.  Soon, in our building we will complete the terraces with Wi-Fi access points (in the summer you can sit for a while in the fresh air), several coffee shops and a large dining room. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d16/cb9/eda/d16cb9eda8c547cdafa839750b4ac1c2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  For sports, too, there is everything you need: a multifunctional outdoor area for football, volleyball and basketball, as well as a table tennis and football zone, allows you to warm up at any time of the day, as well as compete with your colleagues.  K In the main building on the ground floor there is a small (but free!) Gym with exercise equipment and several treadmills.  Stretching and relieving stress in the room, and then return to work with a fresh head - priceless! <br><br>  <b>Respect for all</b> <br><br>  Family people can sometimes use their own kindergarten of a technopark (rather, a leisure center), it will open very soon.  It will be possible to take the children with them to work and leave them in the kindergarten for several hours. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/76d/6f7/07d/76d6f707d92291da38afd86bb935cd7a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the other hand, all employees can lead the way of life that is comfortable for them: a special room with separate ventilation was created for smokers, as well as outdoor gazebos in specially designated areas.  Fans of motorcycles and motorcycles can not only park their two-wheeled ‚Äúfriend‚Äù on the territory, but also take advantage of changing rooms and showers, getting to work in a clean and refreshed form. <br><br>  <b>Data Center, OpenSpace and Cabinets</b> <br><br>  In the new business center, we were able to immediately place the data center, and all office areas, and individual offices, and OpenSpace.  Depending on the preferences of different divisions of space were organized differently.  For example, developers need to discuss business issues and have the opportunity to consult with each other, so they mostly sit in an open office space. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1b0/f35/892/1b0f35892797e6bdbc0757c0a6dd3c62.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e22/438/71a/e2243871a8ebf8e75d8e5cca26408cb8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The power supply and ventilation systems in the new building are modern and very well thought out, the level of lighting and heating depends on how many people are in place.  Therefore, the air is always fresh, the temperature is comfortable, and the lighting is sufficient. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/44d/011/b71/44d011b714cd10f68b1ea52ce7131850.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e6f/f55/b72/e6ff55b723c00c0fa4c6feb3a20c5c9d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The office has a well-thought-out layout, so people always have the opportunity to leave the open space in the study, in the kitchen or in the negotiation room to have a conversation, a meeting or talk on the phone.  No one bothers anyone, and this is an important advantage of a renovated office. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3cd/c08/308/3cdc083087f6966926444ce7c2417e9d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0fa/397/0b3/0fa3970b349b958eccb1ba6c546588e9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9ae/b36/218/9aeb36218a69e584497d7ba86f6b7677.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Servers are still waiting to be put on new shelves. <br><br>  Upd.  For many, the infrastructure on such servers is a sign of the company's immaturity.  In some ways, this assessment is correct, but the fact is that this is not an infrastructure - these are personal test servers of developers, of which we have a lot, and it is very expensive to buy rack servers for them.  Our infrastructure is in the stands, but behind the scenes, in Moscow and in Seattle. <br><br>  <b>TechTalks, AllHands and Pizza</b> <br><br>  Virtuozzo has established traditions.  For example, when leaving important announcements, when interesting guests visit us and in some other cases, we collect AllHands Meetings.  In the new office, they go straight to OpenSpace or in a large meeting room (we now have 5 of them). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/009/667/873/0096678731cfee458969b6c47aa10686.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f8e/a7e/be9/f8ea7ebe96f2bbe476067910e547e98d.png" alt="image"><br><br>  For TechTalks, which we organize after visiting various events by our employees, so that they can share their impressions and talk about innovations, the meeting rooms have become just an irreplaceable format.  Interested professionals gather in comfortable rooms in a relaxed atmosphere and order pizza.  This is how we support the awareness of colleagues and their positive fighting spirit! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/89d/ae7/7a7/89dae77a74cfbea6fb934134cf9e2193.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Can live</b> <br><br>  Right in the office there is a kitchen where you can not only drink coffee or tea, but also have a full meal.  This is very convenient in cases where the work goes on atypical time: for example, for technical support.  You can cook something yourself and order pizza.  Big fridge - at your service. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d38/d30/180/d38d301804da9b29ae01ce7c680088e1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5cb/bc4/a44/5cbbc4a44141d684aeb3e66743896223.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In other words, with housewarming once again our entire team! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3c4/612/f87/3c4612f87c6f9e65834702e5fcc44398.jpg" alt="image">  &gt; <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ee9/f47/ea0/ee9f47ea0b10782455634e1c567f438b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Any wishes are accepted from the staff to further improve the office, and the rest are asked to vote - is our office good, and would you like to work with us? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/321432/">https://habr.com/ru/post/321432/</a></p>
