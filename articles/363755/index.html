  <section class="page js-page"><h1>As avito.ru profitable to sell second-hand equipment</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The market for new portable devices is huge and growing with each passing hour.  And the market for second-hand equipment is growing, probably every minute.  Often, selling your outdated smartphone or tablet is not ‚Äúfor a penny‚Äù is very difficult.  As they told me on one radio market - ‚ÄúI held it in my hands - I lost half the price‚Äù.  This means that a smartphone that has been in use for about a year should drop in price to a symbolic "thousand" (maybe two). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  So how to sell the one-year-old HTC One S (bought for 12K) and beat off at least 40% (4800r)? </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bf3/fdd/692/bf3fdd6925124f17b0447b7eae420f37.JPG"><br><br>  So, the first thing I did was go to the nearest technology market (top crust), scanned prices and availability, and then climbed onto avito.ru.  Here I was disappointed.  Chances to carry out the conceived literally melted before our eyes.  When I bought a smartphone, it was hard to find, but now there are hundreds of online and offline offers.  Prices ranged for a new from 6000 to 8000r, for second-hand - 2000-6000r, depending on the condition of the goods and the greed of the seller. <br><br><h4>  Plan </h4><br>  Copying ads does not make sense, so I made a small plan about what I would need: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      1. Catchy headline. <br>  2. Good text.  The usual listing of all the characteristics is hardly the most desirable information when buying a second-hand product.  Plus, it is worth trying to formulate the disadvantages as advantages, if possible.  Be honest, even if you do not believe in karma.  Extra we remove.  For example - who needs an overdue warranty card or a check indicating the value of the goods at the time of purchase.  Perceived value does not add. <br>  3. High-quality photos.  Must be real!  Despite the fact that this is just a private announcement.  Although not - especially since it is a private ad. <br>  4. Creation of artificial deficiency. <br>  5. Reasonable price.  For both sides. <br><br><h4>  Action! </h4><br>  After a dozen options with the title, I stopped at a simple one - HTC One S (4.4.2 Kit-Kat). <br>  Anyone who is looking for this smartphone already knows its characteristics and the OS version (4.1 Jelly Bean), which means that the mention of the latest version of the OS for Android (4.4. Kit-Kat) should at least intrigue. <br><br>  The text was prepared in accordance with the knowledge of all the "pitfalls" that customers learn from reviews before buying.  It is good that I did not have these stones. <br><br>  Self ad: <br>  <i>‚Ä¢ S4 processor.</i>  <i>The case does not peel off, production Taiwan;</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚Ä¢ The phone already has the firmware version Kit-Kat 4.4.2 Sense 6 (with Blink Feed) from the flagship HTC One M8, so you can install the latest gaming and software updates;</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚Ä¢ About a year of use, the battery holds more than a day;</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚Ä¢ Ideally, the screen - on the day of purchase, glued high-quality film, lay down from the factory and still pleases the eye;</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚Ä¢ The camera focuses and removes instantly, the quality is excellent (8Mp, resolution 3264x1840).</i>  <i>While recording / watching video (HD 1080p), you can take good quality pictures.</i>  <i>There is also HDR, photosphere, continuous shooting, face and smile recognition, and many, many other settings.</i>  <i>Built-in photo editor;</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚Ä¢ The speaker is loud.</i>  <i>Music through the headphones "dense" with built-in effect BeatsAudio.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Comfortable, aluminum and thin (7.8mm);</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Miniature friend and helper;</i> <i><br></i>  <i>In great condition.</i>  <i>Does not brake, does not heat up.</i>  <i>There are subtle wear on the body;</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The set will be with HTC branded headphones (earbuds with headset, white), a box with documents, charging, cable (for charging and syncing), OTG cable (for connecting flash drives, card readers, mice, etc.) and silicone overlay (black );</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Until September 10, I will give for 4500 (by self).</i>  <i>After the 10th there will be 5000 without bargaining!</i> <br><br>  A photo: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bcc/193/4bc/bcc1934bcaad45028d25c86851af769d.JPG"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/597/646/376/5976463768ce4df5934051b5c3c6ca3b.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ee2/a5a/453/ee2a5a453079480085efcaa75deba519.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Dry residue </h4><br>  For 2 weeks, the ad collected 1064 views, 4 people wrote to me and received another 18 calls. The conversion was 2%. <br><br>  The average number of views of similar ads for this period (according to my observations) reached a maximum of 100-150 views, even taking into account periodic changes and ‚Äúuplifts‚Äù of the ad.  Remark - due to high competition in Moscow, the ad falls in search in a matter of hours. <br><br>  There are ads that gain 300 or more views.  But this is a price tag of about 1000-2000 rubles and the title does not hint that the smartphone is ‚Äúdead‚Äù or for spare parts, plus a photo from the official site. <br>  The other day I looked at the ads on the request of "HTC One S" in Moscow - all the same people, only ads raised or changed. <br><br>  I successfully sold the smartphone for 37.5% (4500r) of the initial cost in two weeks and bought myself a new one.  Everyone was satisfied, including the client. <br><br>  PS In reality, I suffered a month with the announcement.  Only after working on the mistakes of the first week, I was expected to succeed, namely, a profitable sale.  For 15-20% of the original cost, you can sell in a couple of days. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/363755/">https://habr.com/ru/post/363755/</a></p>
