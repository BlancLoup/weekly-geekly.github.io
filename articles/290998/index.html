      Researching campus security issues can make the difficult process of finding a university or college even harder.  In accordance with federal law, colleges are required to establish standard safety protocols on campus. <br><br>  Parents and applicants can look at the university's annual security report, which should be available on the school's website, in order to find statistics on crime, disciplinary action and campus security policies. <br><br>  1. What should a university do to make it safe? <br><br>  For parents and applicants, campus security should be a priority.  And universities, in turn, should make campus security a # 1 issue.  If you put the issue of security in the first place and bring it to public attention, then this will attract more future students to this particular university. <br><br>  2. How quickly does the university respond to emergencies that occur on campus? <br><br>  The university can and should use various methods of different methods of warning students in times of danger.  These can be emails, warning displays, or siren sounds.  Ideally, universities should be able to use modern technologies such as telephones and the Internet.  Find out or have such methods of warning at the university. <br><br>  3. Do police officers or campuses on duty on the campus fully rely on their own security system even if they are located outside the city? <br><br>  Prospective students should be aware or campus safety is monitored by private companies or state police, and how the security team coordinates its emergency situations.  Security personnel, no matter whether it is the police or private structure, should be trained to respond quickly to all sorts of situations, be able to provide first aid and know the fire safety technique.  Students should also know about penalties. <br><br>  4. Who investigates sexually motivated crimes at a university / university campus? <br><br>  It may sound like this, but it is a harsh truth, and it happens that students become victims of sexual crimes.  The main goal of the university is to prevent such incidents in every possible way.  The student should be aware of who to contact and what to write if he is a victim of harassment or is suspicious.  Also, the student's family should be confident that the university will ensure the privacy and security of the student during the investigation, if it so happened that the incident took place.  Families of students, as well as the student himself, should look first and foremost to the statute and rules of the university on this delicate, but very important topic. <br><br>  5. How are the disciplinary commissions trained to investigate and prevent them? <br><br>  Online training for a disciplinary commission can be a quick and easy way to teach psychological and legal ways to prevent sexual abuse, but live learning is always preferable.  Studies of sexual assault are considered among the most difficult to investigate (along with murder).  Parents and students should expect the university to train a disciplinary commission to investigate crimes committed on sexual grounds. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290998/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290998/</a></p>
