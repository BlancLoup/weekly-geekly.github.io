Such people do not seek compromise - either all or nothing.  For them it does not matter what price the first will be received.  The main thing is to confidently go forward, up, be one step ahead of others. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/090/dc4/860/090dc486054b897edcee1c0747ad9eed.jpg" width="499" height="304"><br><br>  In my today's review I will tell just about such an accessory.  Dear and stylish.  Unique.  The first. <br>  Detailed review.  <u>Traffic</u> !!! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At the <strong>CeBIT</strong> <strong>2009</strong> exhibition that was held this spring, <strong>ASUS</strong> pleasantly surprised connoisseurs of beauty - demonstrated the <strong>ASUS VX5 Lamborghini</strong> laptop, the case of which was made ‚Äúbased on‚Äù the new exclusive <strong><a href="http://www.netcarshow.com/lamborghini/2008-reventon/">Lamborghini Reventon</a></strong> car, which was released in just 20 copies.

Here's how you think it is used as a fiery high-performance motor?  Is Intel a processor?  Yes, yes, he is!  In general, under the "hood" is the following "stuffing" - a four-cylinder silicon <a href="http://syndication.intel.com/DistributeModule.aspx%3Fppc_cid%3DIIP_00975069814%26amp%3Bcc%3DRU%26amp%3BcontentType%3D0"><strong>Intel Core 2 Quad</strong></a> <strong>Q9000</strong> processor with a clock frequency of 2 GHz (FSB 1066 MHz and L2 cache 6 MB) on the <strong>Intel PM45</strong> / ICH9-M chipset.  Add to this 4 gigabytes of DDR3 RAM (1066 MHz), gigabytes of GDDR3 memory on discrete nVIDIA GeForce GT130M and a terabyte of space on two SATA drives (2.5 ‚Äù, 5400 rpm).  From memory, I don‚Äôt even name a laptop that would stand alongside in performance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a75/48a/c6e/a7548ac6eea3724a38ff097d696beae3.png" width="390" height="438"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/232/7c1/0f3/2327c10f379ee504f99d6aa16d0c27c8.png" width="400" height="468"><br><br>  By the way, an even more ‚Äúvigorous‚Äù sports car was presented at the exhibition - with a 1TB solid-state disk (!).  Such a complete set will result in the owner a good pretty penny, but I got an instance, the configuration of which was described above. <br><br>  In addition to the laptop in the box was a manual, network cable, AC adapter.  When the device goes on sale, it will also include a branded mouse and a leather bag-case.  Well, very good, although it would be very nice to be surprised by something else. <br><br><h2>  Appearance </h2><br>  The appearance of the supercar can not be left without proper attention.  On the roof of the snow-white "car" (a black version of the design will also be available) there is a black badge with a gold bullhead.  During operation, a thin stroke around the nameplate is lit in white and lilac. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/50a/4c7/23e/50a4c723e8c8e310ed4bbf500a1f5af2.jpg" width="500" height="375"><br><br>  In addition to the icon, there are decorative grilles and an interesting relief of the lid itself - the elegance of aerodynamic shapes and curves is really surprising. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ba9/24f/f6f/ba924ff6f1fd562264b818c137a188bc.jpg" width="500" height="279"><br><br>  From the glossy metal surface blows pleasant coolness, almost no prints remain on it.  But this is not a reason not to call in to the sink) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5ff/271/eac/5ff271eac31d8292accd1cfdacbda14c.jpg" width="500" height="386"><br><br>  Putting the car on the "pit", on the bottom you can disassemble the closed system compartments, several ventilation openings (the most unusual of which is round), battery latches, rubber tire legs.  The latter, by the way, keep the grip on the ‚Äútrack‚Äù up to standard - the laptop never went anywhere. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a29/1c9/c66/a291c9c6667a1486aba464af6497d20c.jpg" width="500" height="375"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/968/e9a/079/968e9a079e20936356ecc70e6cdfb3f4.jpg" width="500" height="295"><br><br>  When viewed from the front - you can see a small window of the IR receiver, a Wi-Fi mode switch and 4 informational LEDs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b76/d22/81d/b76d2281df0dec946bcb004c64a7eafa.jpg" width="500" height="121"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e07/04d/b2d/e0704db2dfff7f86ae37448e0e91d48c.jpg" width="500" height="219"><br><br>  By the way, as headlights, they are not serious - they shine barely, which does not distract the driver from the road at all, even in the dark. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/412/5fe/a49/4125fea4927e8c1894fafa10828d932a.jpg" width="499" height="294"><br><br>  Behind - a detail of the ceramic hinge, a hole for the lock, acb, one USB connector, a gigabit network port and a connector for mains supply via an adapter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ed5/c44/feb/ed5c44febc7bed521b729c163fafca03.jpg" width="500" height="131"><br><br>  It would seem that the right and left side of the machine should be symmetrical, but it was not there) On the left - in addition to the stylish vents, the VGA port, USB, antenna input, 1394 port, eSATA, HDMI, card reader and ExpressCard slot are located.  It turns out, you can connect almost any device!  Bravo. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0e8/aed/883/0e8aed883b79e6908d431df8a19dabd9.jpg" width="500" height="151"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9c8/2c0/9d1/9c82c09d14585c641abf152ca8f7c39f.jpg" width="500" height="291"><br><br>  On the right is the metal ‚Äúdoor‚Äù of the BluRay drive, two more USB ports, the usual headphone jacks with a microphone, and the unusual SPDIF connector. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f30/4ef/b37/f304efb37ed60281399b66280f2acd04.jpg" width="499" height="163"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1bf/b7e/6b3/1bfb7e6b380f26096cc69870c7d38259.jpg" width="500" height="285"><br><br>  "Salon" is covered with black plastic, dark gray brushed metal and black leather with an elegant white stitch. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bea/7e9/2c1/bea7e92c1c5ba97a5dc42edbe29aa86a.jpg" width="500" height="327"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bbd/909/e09/bbd909e092d429323015af804016ce1b.jpg" width="500" height="367"><br><br>  Above the widescreen display (16 ‚Äù, 1366x768) with a thick frame is a camera module, protected by durable sapphire crystal. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d29/783/384/d29783384c5ce985981cbc53a2166e7f.jpg" width="499" height="333"><br><br>  Above the keyboard are 4 touch keys, the purpose of which is easy to guess by the icons. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8d9/935/56f/8d993556f2f14cb9fcad0e6d4a32a510.jpg" width="499" height="145"><br><br>  On the sides of the buttons - "gills" speakers.  To the left of the keyboard are two separate buttons on a metal substrate, one of which turns on the device, and the second includes the afterburner mode. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/14f/b9d/bd8/14fb9dbd8c0797a2de4ace5066317f73.jpg" width="500" height="375"><br><br>  The latter, by the way, wasn‚Äôt possible to launch on the test sample, but it‚Äôs known for certain that this button adds ‚Äúhorses‚Äù to both the processor and the video system.  Under these buttons are three oblong white indicator. <br><br>  The keyboard itself is superb - divided black buttons with white markings, full-sized with rounded edges.  They are very pleasant to the touch, huddle easily and completely silently.  The layout is also convenient - did not like only the small right Shift and Enter.  There is no digital unit - the machine is not for accountants :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/534/94a/baa/53494abaa9770a797260c274e623f1fd.jpg"><br><br>  The touchpad buttons are ceramic - wear-resistant material, which is used in the manufacture of brake systems of the highest level (and not only in them). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/edc/76f/e52/edc76fe520bd51bae10902bd73f1914a.jpg" width="434" height="600"><br><br>  Between the buttons - a fingerprint scanner. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7f4/f46/d5f/7f4f46d5fe14f836887b35be20fdeb94.jpg" width="500" height="287"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bde/8d0/011/bde8d0011a54ad4dd037de1c09d20c0d.jpg" width="500" height="284"><br><br>  The touch panel itself is glass, with a scroll area.  It is very convenient to use, the click is quiet and pleasant;  the only thing that upsets is the prints-prints-prints ... <br><br><h2>  Turn on and work </h2><br>  Immediately after the ‚Äúdriver‚Äù starts his ‚Äúcar‚Äù, he will please the owner with a white key illumination, the brightness of which is automatically controlled by the light sensor.  In addition to the keys, the frame around the ceramic touchpad is also highlighted, but the color is already blue.  The next surprise, literally in an instant, will be a frisky sporty growl of a motor, coming from the depths of the device.  There are no further surprises, except for the boot time (about 20 seconds on the Windows Vista 64bit highway) and the subsequent speed of work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bc4/4f5/f11/bc44f5f11fb000f088359c1e48731fd9.jpg"><br><br>  Alternatively, you can make chip tuning - then you can ride the bonus track in the face of <strong>ASUS ExpressGate</strong> - all cars of the company (cars of other manufacturers go through the forest) pass through it in 7-8 seconds - after the finish line full-fledged file manager becomes available, Skype and IM client, photo and music player. <br><br>  Two-megapixel camera module, which gives a smart picture for Skype.  Who else uses integrated cameras for what?  Oh yeah, as an option - <strong>ASUS Smart Logon</strong> , which you can always put.  You can also install additional software for the camera - <strong>ASUS LifeFrame</strong> , which, perhaps, is the best shell for the cameras among those available. <br>  Speakers - protective speaker grids in a laptop is enough, the sound is very, very.  There are even some bass ... but the headphones still have a much more vivid picture.  I think the SPDIF connector can be considered a nice bonus, which will allow you to play sound from the connected multichannel acoustics. <br><br><h2>  Performance </h2><br>  I dare to suggest that this figure laptop can enter the top ten most-most, because laptops on high-performance <a href="http://syndication.intel.com/DistributeModule.aspx%3Fppc_cid%3DIIP_00975069814%26amp%3Bcc%3DRU%26amp%3BcontentType%3D0"><strong>Intel Core 2 Quad processors</strong></a> can be counted on the fingers of one hand.  And so with a terabyte SSD - there have never been such a person! <br><br>  Nevertheless, even ‚Äúfor beautiful eyes‚Äù (which the laptop built all the time while I was there) tests cannot be avoided.  I chose a fairly standard scheme - first I installed all the latest drivers (chipset, video card), then removed all the excess from autostart and services, and only then began to measure.  As measuring instruments, I used <strong>3DMark 05-06</strong> three-dimensional synthetic tests, complex <strong>PCMark05,</strong> and mathematical tasks such as <strong>SuperPi</strong> , <strong>CPUMark</strong> and <strong>wPrime</strong> .  And after all this, on the ‚Äúheated‚Äù car tried <strong>Crysis</strong> - where do without it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/576/daf/832/576daf8329a50007abcca1aac2e90e63.jpg" width="499" height="402"><br><br>  The operating system gave a solid 5.5 points. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fd8/773/95a/fd877395ae27ce244bcd68cc3b731fe9.png" width="500" height="337"><br><br>  In the colorful <strong>3</strong> <strong>DMark</strong> <strong>05,</strong> at the maximum resolution of the test (1920x1080), the notebook produced no less <strong>than 7122</strong> points without smoothing.  On the settings easier (by default, 1024x768), the estimate has <strong>grown</strong> - <strong>10665</strong> parrots. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a7d/9cb/a5d/a7d9cba5d45d9b4d2a2722671258f1f8.jpg" width="500" height="335"><br><br>  The no less colorful <strong>3DMark06</strong> scores were the following - <strong>4356</strong> (1920x1080, No AA) and <strong>5594</strong> (1280x1024, No AA) points. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/76b/382/185/76b3821858290ef418e19d6fbd608370.png"><br><br>  Well, not bad - by the standards of some notebooks.  <strong>PC</strong> <strong>M</strong> <strong>ark05</strong> worked more than an hour, but due to some error in one of the tests did not produce a holistic final result.  I will announce the received points - <strong>6912</strong> in the CPU Score, <strong>4636</strong> in Memory Score and <strong>7099</strong> in the Graphics Score. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f0d/371/ae1/f0d371ae1a251b9cc97d00ffd207a89e.png" width="500" height="260"><br><br>  The number of pi to a million in <strong>SuperPi 1.5</strong> counted in <strong>22.324</strong> seconds. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/25a/9b0/f7f/25a9b0f7f91f0fbf588e5d91b37cd2b7.png" width="318" height="300"><br><br>  In the <strong>wPrime</strong> <strong>2.0</strong> program (with multi-core support), the 32M test lasted <strong>19.454</strong> seconds, and the 1024M test lasted as much as <strong>607.154</strong> seconds. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/230/58a/77d/23058a77d46d687619df61c6f365a5cb.png" width="500" height="282"><br><br>  <strong>CPUMark 2.2</strong> - 29.68 seconds. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ec3/2b0/34d/ec32b034d1768330eea2a33bf7e07424.png" width="311" height="269"><br><br>  It seems that there is not an Intel processor, but a processor!  :) <br><br>  The <strong>Crysis Warhead 1.2.0.0</strong> benchmark at the maximum available resolution (1920x1080) was very solidly inhibited, yielding a maximum of 5FPS.  But in a simpler resolution, the FPSs reached very acceptable values, up to 25. Having tried to play the Crisis itself, everything was confirmed - to enjoy the sound in the Razer Megalodon, running at the level, it is possible only at the initial resolutions, sometimes even without smoothing.  For this I was ready, because  the game sometimes slows down even on some SLI systems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/340/516/903/340516903c08d8c8bf73d8611a27a462.jpg" width="500" height="375"><br><br>  Summing up the preliminary result - the performance is at a very high level.  If this notebook may not be the best choice for modern games, then for all other tasks it fits perfectly - text, surfing, music, movies, working with graphics, amateur 3D modeling, and so on ... a universal soldier, not otherwise) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7c2/e63/48b/7c2e6348b4b1432d877412250d9ab52c.jpg" width="500" height="272"><br><br>  In the <strong>HDTune Pro 3.50</strong> test - quite decent results, judge for yourself: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1f7/605/90c/1f760590c19165ddef0e0d1c70ff935b.png" width="499" height="435"><br><br><h2>  Check weighing </h2><br>  <u><b>Pros:</b></u> <br>  - Appearance, body materials and build quality - 6 points out of 5; <br>  - Convenient layout, separate keys, fingerprint scanner; <br>  - A bright "colorful" screen, backlit keyboard and touchpad; <br>  - Performance - Vooot takoyoy width, Vooot takoyoy height! <br><br>  <u><b>Minuses:</b></u> <br>  - Glossy screen and touchpad; <br>  - Weight more than 3 kilograms - keep your biceps at the ready; <br>  - High-performance system - good and sometimes noisy ventilation; <br>  - The battery life is rather modest - a little less than two hours; <br>  - A short distance between USB ports - some flash drives or modems may not fit; <br>  - Biting price (from 100 000 rubles). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/19f/154/193/19f154193cc99fd61b13d8f87187bc69.jpg" width="500" height="368"><br><br><h2>  Total </h2><br>  In my opinion, the device is almost devoid of cons.  Why do I think so?  Because everything is logical and connected - a truly high-performance system is guaranteed to like to eat a battery and is unlikely to agree to be small, light, and even less so cheap.  As for the display - in this model it is also called to ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù, but really rich colors are found only in glossy screens.  Therefore, if you close your eyes to the prints (which are in any device), then there is nothing to complain about so far.  But it‚Äôs not worth it - nothing is perfect. <br><br>  ASUS has once again managed to set the heat in the world of portable computers - at CeBIT 2009, the novelty surprised, perhaps, everyone.  Everywhere you look, you can feel style and superiority everywhere.  I think for successful uncles in jackets this is just what you need.  By the way, they often choose ‚Äúaccording to their clothes‚Äù, not paying attention to the rich inner world of devices.  But even in these matters, the ‚Äúbug‚Äù did not disappoint.  Keep it up! <br><br>  Feel free to vote for reviews, talk, ask questions and constructively criticize - all this helps me to become better. <br><br>  <i>¬© Boomburum, 2009, specially for <a href="http://www.trendclub.ru/">Trend Club</a> &amp; Habrahabr.ru</i> <br><br>  <b>Successes!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/70632/">https://habr.com/ru/post/70632/</a></p>
