And today I was given a link <a href="http://www.e1.ru/news/spool/news_id-295301.html"><font color="#008000"><b>to the news</b></font></a> , which many can make you think. <br><br>  I quote: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ************************************************** *************** <br>  <i><b>Users will be obliged to check the licensing of the programs used</b></i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>In the near future, users of pirated computer programs, as well as owners of home networks and video hosting sites, will begin to be fined for infringing intellectual property rights, even if they did not know that they are using counterfeit.</i> <i>

    </i>  <i>The plenary sessions of the Supreme and Supreme Arbitration Courts prepared a draft resolution, which explains the 1250 article of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation, Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights, which came into force on January 1, 2008.</i>  <i>This article states that the absence of guilt does not relieve the offender from the need to stop the use of counterfeit goods, and does not exclude the application of sanctions to him.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Previously, the punishment was applied only to innocent legal entities - users of counterfeit goods, but now this practice is extended to ordinary citizens.</i>  <i>The Supreme and Arbitration Courts clarified that a person who used counterfeit unconsciously can only reduce the amount of the fine (in the case of a deliberate violation, it ranges from 10 thousand to five million rubles), but not exempt from it at all.</i>  <i>That is, the user can now be fined, even if he proves that he did not know about the illegality of the program installed on his home computer.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Also, individuals will be fined for posting and downloading counterfeit in networks and on hosting (even if they did not know that they post and download pirated copies).</i>  <i>True, there are difficulties with the search for users.</i>  <i>However, lawyers believe that these difficulties will be compensated for by the fact that now there is an opportunity to hold the owners of networks and hosting companies accountable.</i>  <i>Previously, it was difficult to prove that the owner, for example, Youtube, knows about the appearance of a counterfeit on his hosting.</i>  <i>Now this is not required.</i> <br>  ************************************************** *************** <br><br>  Do not let the apartment?  Write a search warrant (or as they call it) in view of the evidence indicating the presence of a counterfeit in the apartment - I'm sorry how to send two bytes.  Lists of suspects - in any provider office.  Making the provider find out which OS is in one or another user is not difficult (we are looking for those who go to the Internet with MSIE, we‚Äôve raised the history of support calls, we especially note fans of torrents and similar donkeys). <br><br>  Well, then - the matter of technology.  Already worked out (she herself was a direct witness of ‚ÄúEVERYONE GET OFF FROM COMPUTERS !!!‚Äù).  Coming with a warrant and removal of equipment for examination.  For a couple of months.  Or when there hands reach to check your computer in a long queue confiscated.  You can, of course, and not withdraw - if you agree to present a pack of crisp universal licenses, giving the right not only to Windows Photoshop, but also to drive drunk, drinking alcohol in public places and other jokes that require similar licensing. <br><br>  This is <b><i>such</i></b> an item of income during the crisis (which, as one Russian Dima claimed, we don‚Äôt have and never will), which is strange to me that it hasn‚Äôt worked yet. <br><br>  I look forward to the start of the raid - because werewolves in uniform and gray uniform have to tighten their belts, and soon, God forbid, and starve.  And worse than a hungry werewolf in uniform - I personally do not know the beast.  Let it be better fed.  And after all, indeed, as <a href="http://dolboeb.livejournal.com/1409335.html%3Fview%3D63675959"><font color="#008000"><b>Nosik predicts</b></font></a> , <i>‚Äúpeople in uniform use their service weapons not to oppose guest workers and local criminals, but to rob and kill those who, in their understanding, are better dressed.‚Äù</i> too greedy to pay for your favorite Windows, or too lazy to master free software, than "rob those who are better dressed." <br><br>  But even in spite of the fact that I have been using exclusively free or honestly purchased software for a long time, an obsessive little thought haunts me ... Something tells me that the operatives will first take the equipment away for examination, and only then, in a calm environment - what and on what grounds have you installed there. <br><br>  Are you still using warez?  Then they will come to you. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/45762/">https://habr.com/ru/post/45762/</a></p>
