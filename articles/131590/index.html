A business forum is, first of all, a round table of IT specialists from all over the world - and you will see how interesting speakers IBM has been able to invite to this event not far from Moscow.

      As the theater begins with a hanger, so the business forum begins with registration and breakfast for all participants.  The first part of this action, which will take the entire period from morning to dinner, is focused exclusively on programmers, system administrators and all sorts of specialists in the information field.  We know that you do not like to get up early in the morning, but to arrive at 9 am for an event of this magnitude is worth a slightly shorter sleep. <br><br>  After the opening of the forum, at 10 am, the first main section for professionals will begin, divided into several parts, where everyone can choose the most interesting topic of discussion. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In four rooms there will be major discussions on the following topics: <br><ul><li>  Congress Hall: this is the place where the most interesting trends and trends in the modern IT industry will be discussed.  You will be addressed by analysts of the largest corporations in the world, including IBM specialists, who will tell about their vision of how all the processes in this area will be carried out tomorrow.  From the clouds and social networks, this topic can flow into everything, anything - you decide what questions to ask and what topics to open. </li><li>  In the second hall (Singapore) we will talk about the effective optimization of IT infrastructures at all levels for faster and more adequate solutions to the challenges facing business and society.  Here the main thesis is that information is the key business asset of today and only those who know how to work with it will achieve the greatest success. </li><li>  In the third hall (Belo Horizonte) they will look for answers to the challenges of modern realities: how to develop popular products and services?  How to integrate existing technologies and techniques?  If you care about these questions - do not get lost. </li><li>  Finally, in the last hall (Shanghai), approaches to building a sensible city and infrastructure will be considered - this primarily concerns innovative strategies for modernizing the life and livelihoods of large cities in Russia, building an eco-model of the urban environment and the role of innovation in different cities. </li></ul><br>  After a short coffee break in the same halls, the discussion of the subject matter set in the morning will continue, but now numerous forum guests will also take part in it. <br><ul><li>  The theme set in the morning (see above) will continue in the congress hall, but with an emphasis on the present, and not an abstract future.  What role do technology and innovation play today in modernizing our life, society, cities and the whole country? </li><li>  In the second hall (Singapore), where the main topic is optimization, they will discuss integrated service management to avoid unnecessary complexity in building infrastructure in your company - all this concerns data processing centers, mainframes, as well as risk and security management and security issues . </li><li>  A visit to the third hall (Belo Horizonte) after the break is especially recommended for those who for some reason doubt the necessity and efficiency of integrating existing, viable systems into their business.  Such as electronic document management, use of general archives, social business networks, online interaction and mobility of an employee of the company, as well as how it can be used. </li><li>  Finally, at the last round table (Shanghai), the discussion will deal with the maintenance of cloud infrastructure.  Leading experts from IBM and partner organizations will talk about how data centers are designed, built and maintained.  This section is not centripetal, and therefore the issues of user support and technical support of the infrastructure itself will also be raised. </li></ul><br>  It is unlikely that in such a short form one can state the entire information array that will be raised within the walls of the Moscow School of Management Skolkovo.  The event is by no means a meeting of jackets and white-collar - rather, on the contrary, T-shirts and jeans, because we first of all invite all forum participants to communicate informally, ask uncomfortable questions, and reveal sharp topics. <br><br>  In the end, after several hours of discussion and reasoning, all participants will be invited to a festive reception where they can digress from information technology with delicious food and find an interesting person to ask for everything that interests you.  Come - it will be great!  Yes, and <a href="https://www-950.ibm.com/events/wwe/grp/grp006.nsf/v16_enrollall%3Fopenform%26seminar%3DB5QD7UES%26locale%3Dru_RU%26S_TACT%3D711AP13R">registration is free</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/131590/">https://habr.com/ru/post/131590/</a></p>
