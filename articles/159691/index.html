  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Master Yoda and his paper Padawans: Creative corporate story</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>Preamble</b> <br>  This canvas, adorning the <a href="http://blog.jetbrains.com/">corporate blog JetBrains</a> , can be called ‚ÄúMaster Yoda and his paper Padawans‚Äù. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e57/119/a60/e57119a60510783bef771bddea4d5781.png"><br>  The work is intended to illustrate the masterful level of blog postings.  Paperiness, or rather origami, gives the group of creatures some lightness and non-binding, which is very suitable for the format of the blog itself.  The monotonous technical text pleasantly emphasizes the vivid emotionality of the images of the master and his children-students, and the words ‚Äú... pleasure ... develop‚Äù will subtly refer the user to the picture at pleasant moments when these descendants of the master, his future students, only conceived, made, do not fear this word, "Developed". <br><br>  Creating and, most importantly, coordinating graphics in our company does not always go smoothly.  Someone orders the graphics, another makes it, the third, fifth and tenth comment, and everything, like in the famous Krylov's fable, is pulled in different directions.  This is approximately how this process evolved in this case. <br><br>  <b>Chief of blogs</b> : Creative received.  Have questions. <br>  <b>Designer</b> : At your service! <br>  <b>Blog Chief</b> : Why Green?  Green is no good. <br><a name="habracut"></a>  <b>Designer</b> : Here are paper creatures called to remind the master Yoda from Star Wars.  Jedi Teachers  Padawan pet. <br>  Blog <b>Chief</b> : And we are sued by Lucas or some origami mogul. <br>  <b>Designer</b> : Figures only resemble Yoda, but they are not. <br>  <b>Blog Chief</b> : Green put it away.  And further.  In the slogan confused words.  It will be correct to ‚ÄúDevelop with pleasure!‚Äù, And you have the opposite and still some point.  Who puts a point in the slogan?  Basics you need to know! <br>  <b>Designer</b> : Words are set in this order intentionally.  With such a German accent, Yoda speaks. <br>  Blog <b>Chief</b> : Fear Lucas.  Maybe the word sequence change has been patented.  And besides, Yoda, it seems, is Chinese.  So all this is murk.  The client will not understand us. <br>  <b>Designer</b> : And who is our client? <br>  <b>Chief of blogs</b> : We create sophisticated products for developers, we urge them to ‚Äúdevelop with pleasure‚Äù - in order to make the process more pleasant. <br>  <b>Designer</b> : Well, right: pleasure, pleasure, nicer ... one to one. <br>  <b>Blogging Chief</b> : Where is the erotic subtext here?  We don't need pornography!  This network is enough. <br>  <b>Designer</b> : Since our innovative concern has the slogan ‚ÄúDevelop with pleasure!‚Äù, The pleasure is clearly stated.  Yes, and urbandictionary.com says about things quite unequivocal things.  And so I could not get around this context and looked deeper.  I showed that the result of "development with pleasure" are children, and this is wonderful.  Thus, as a result of the ‚Äúdevelopment with pleasure‚Äù from one IntelliJ IDEA, many of her children appeared, who create the wealth of the innovative concern JetBrains.  And this process is pleasant and not at all ashamed!  We and our client urge to move away from the monitor and go "to develop our view with pleasure."  Is this contrary to the basics of marketing? <br>  <b>Blog Director</b> : Well, everything is clear.  One-sided picture of the perception of the world!  Scary to hang such a perversion on the blog.  Sue for propaganda.  But the point at the end of the slogan will have to be removed.  Point is not needed.  Need an exclamation mark. <br>  <b>Designer</b> : The wrong shade will work.  Ceremonial and stupid.  And the matter concerns ‚Äúpleasure‚Äù. <br>  <b>Blog Chief</b> : Maniac.  Let's clean the padawans.  And remove Yoda.  And bring the text to the patented state.  And yet ... another time when you send to the customer, then you still check the layout so that there are no random objects left there.  That shred is green.  Clearly trash layer. <br>  <b>Designer</b> : No  This is a failed padawan.  After all, our concern had some failed Padawans ... as I recall ... <br>  <b>Blog Director</b> : Don't!  Just why should customers show their mistakes?  Why abortive material? <br>  <b>Designer</b> : Recognizing mistakes is a trait of a strong character. <br>  <b>Blog Chief</b> : Well, yes, yes.  I'm waiting for the normal option. <br>  <b>Designer</b> : Here.

And we are a serious, solid company, we must have a serious solid blog.  Still! <br>  <b>Designer</b> : Here. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/973/cda/aa5/973cdaaa50fa6ff6709e617e075c6162.png"><br><br>  <b>Chief of blogs</b> : Smuggling and espionage.

Somehow not solid. <br>  <b>Designer</b> : Well, it's like ‚Äúwhat's on JetBrains‚Äù on the mind, and a baseball cap, as it were, encodes an informal format. <br>  <b>Chief of blogging</b> : JetBrains on JB's mind.  Perfectly!  Some kind of self-irony with a touch of nearness ... Maybe we have smiling living people, like reputable companies?  Let's. <br>  <b>Designer</b> : And let's look! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/37c/8e9/77c/37c8e977c69a192f98749e786c05519d.png"><br><br>  <b>Chief of blogs</b> : <b>Hmmm</b> ... And this is an intellectual, her mother, elite ... <br>  <b>Designer</b> : But corporately! <br>  <b>Chief of blogs</b> : We need to show different people to the world!  Search  I am waiting. <br>  <b>Designer</b> : Where already there.  That's just the keyboard.  And blue!  Blue! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c78/49d/81b/c7849d81b1fe171007fc8a4821477df1.png"><br><br>  <b>Blogging Chief</b> : Oh!  Exactly what was needed!  Simple and tasteful.  And even solid.  The client will understand.  Well, only the font sucks.  Font need to search.  And why was he fooling around with all this muddy! <br><br>  <b>Question</b> : Why did Yoda end up? <br>  (A curtain) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/159691/">https://habr.com/ru/post/159691/</a></p>
