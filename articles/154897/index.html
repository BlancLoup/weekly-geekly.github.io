We have just that moment just come.  October is outside the window, and we have a new year in our office and it smells like Christmas tree.  In anticipation of the holiday, everyone is silly smiling and waiting for guests with mild anxiety (and suddenly they will not come).  However, enough about us, let's about interesting. <br><br><h4>  What actually for the service?  What does he give? </h4><br>  The service is called <a href="https://business3.biz/">business3.biz</a> .  It allows any person whose degree of familiarity with Internet technologies has already given him the opportunity to register on a social network and fill out a profile (ceremonial music sounds) ... to create a full-fledged online store.  The result looks like this. <br><br> <a href="http://test_1.business3.biz/products/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0d3/107/e8e/0d3107e8e2c7ea34fdbee6fc0cbe415c.jpg"></a> <br>  <i>clickable</i>

      The sophisticated critic will notice - ‚ÄúAnd the design is amazingly similar for everyone!‚Äù.  "Your truth is the same scoundrel" - we will answer him. <a name="habracut"></a>  They didn‚Äôt try to think of a website without any design at all - it turned out that it was a design.  And all right, we thought, maybe he won't be noticed there.  However, attempts have not been abandoned, we hope that sometime, in the course of experiments with emptiness, we will comprehend the mystery of making websites without any design at all.  Well, his problems alone, almost always ugly.  No wonder documents on pure paper are printed. <br><br><h4>  How to use it?  Is it your ‚Äúany person‚Äù hardcore? </h4><br>  Rightly believing that laziness is the key left to us by God, we decided in every possible way to cherish this beloved character we love.  This inspired us to create an admin panel that allows us to fill the site in <s>5 to</s> 6 minutes and launch it.  Here's the movie "from and to." <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iktK3vZqhB8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  But this is a dirty fake!  - the attentive spectator will object, - your specialist is obviously familiar with the system, all materials have been prepared, and some actions have obviously been compressed in time. <br>  Repent, lied.  A healthy directory with a bunch of categories can take a couple of hours.  A payment system will begin to connect - two days to wait for documents.  We will continue to improve. <br>  What is inside?  Brakes?  Is falling?  Sneezes?  Are all vaccinations done? <br>  The system is spinning on several servers under debian. <br>  Consists of: <br>  - database server, postgresql <br>  - servers with a kernel written in C ++ <br>  - servers with fronts - nginx, php, they themselves do not think, only they derive what the kernel thinks <br>  - load balancer <br>  In addition, the client is issued a program that you saw in the video.  It is made in C ++ and Qt.  Suspicions about the availability of versions for Mac and Linux are justified.  By the new year will be. <br><br>  At the time of this writing, the system does not slow down, incl.  under tricky load emulators with very optimistic attendance figures.  As it starts to slow down - quickly add servers / channel. <br>  If you have questions on the technical part - we will tell you with special pleasure. <br><br><h4>  Is there a more formal description?  Some kind of you are not serious. </h4><br>  There is.  <a href="https://business3.biz/upload/b3_rus_what_is_it.pdf">Here</a> .  We are very serious.  Even just took and made a pdf. <br><br>  If among the readers there are people from the management of incubators, universities, various associations, etc.  - Call, there are interesting topics for cooperation. <br><br><h4>  Price issue? </h4><br><br>  There is a free option, fully working.  There is, of course, paid.  =) <br>  All detailed info is <a href="https://business3.biz/">here</a> . <br><br><h4>  Will you give gifts to guests? </h4><br>  Yes, we will, we have the same new year.  Will be registered - enter in the field with the code "Give the bag, Santa Claus!". <br><br><h4>  Final part. </h4><br>  We know that there are errors in the system, but we do not know where.  When you find the doorposts, or bright thoughts / obscene <a href="">attitudes</a> that come to us come to mind, send everything to <a href="">no-reply@business3.biz</a> or write here.  We are going to benefit from all this. <br><br>  Come, wait. <br><br>  UPD. <br>  Hot on the heels added <a href="https://business3.biz/faq/">Q &amp; A</a> and a <a href="https://business3.biz/upload/b3_rus_manual.pdf">manual</a> for the program. <br><br>  PS <br><br>  The project is closed. <br>  Here is our new project Seotrawl.net, <a href="https://seotrawl.net/">Seotrawl.net</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/154897/">https://habr.com/ru/post/154897/</a></p>
