  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Weekdays technical support and features of the Russian soul ...</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Russians tend to suffer ... Classical Russian literature is imbued with the sufferings of heroes, caused, sometimes, not even by specific circumstances, but by their own thoughts.  Sometimes it seems that people specifically create such conditions for themselves that there is a reason to suffer.  They go to the branch of Sberbank to stand in line, instead of connecting themselves to an Internet bank or mobile service.  They sit in polyclinics for three hours to ‚Äújust ask‚Äù ... Or, for example, for years they use the services of an Internet provider who cannot provide the stated speed, withdraws money for subscriptions, blocks websites, etc. Why?  Then to raise the brain to someone ..? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  But alas, the Russian man does not go to talk to a psychologist or let off steam in the gym - he calls for technical support.  Sure that if he pays for some kind of service, for example, the Internet, then for these 400-500 rubles a month he has the right to humiliate, insult a company specialist or a call center employee whose fault is simply that he picked up the phone, and did not put the call on hold. <br><br>  Oh, this iron argument ‚ÄúI'm paying you!‚Äù Yes, it is to me that every half month you come and put an advance payment in my pocket, and then a salary ... WIFI passwords.  Oh yeah, for some reason I don‚Äôt automatically transfer you to a new, cheaper rate.  Why?  Maybe because it is - imposed service and illegal ..? <br><br>  Sometimes claims from customers are even funny.  One man asked for a password from the Wi-Fi ... But as it turned out, not from his, but from the street.  The lady in the years asked to unblock sites "with a strawberry."  for his son And in principle, sometimes a joke or witty response could soften the situation, but for some reason, managers are hitting the head for it.

      But in general, let's be honest with each other.  Don't like bad internet?  Blame provider, Krivorukov installer, hotline operator - ham ..?  Or maybe it is not necessary then every month to make an advance payment ...?  Since we are so bad - your right to change the provider, ask for recalculation in order to return the money.  But the operator or specials.  technical support, by the way, has the right to hang up if a person is rude and swearing.  Inet from threats and stories about "son / son in organs / Moscow / at the top" will not turn on quickly.  Especially if someone cut the cable for you on the general house equipment out of harm. <br><br>  There was once a case.  3 friends live in the same apartment - a gamer, a programmer and a SEO, who used to be a fitter and was just paving the Internet for people.  So, one far from wonderful day the internet was gone.  Totally.  Clearly, tragedy.  They went through all possible solutions, contacted the provider ... They checked everything.  It does not work and that's it. <br><br>  And the casket just opened ... Their neighbors had repairs.  They carried the construction waste onto the landing and leaned on the plasterboard (a lot, so the weight was decent) against the wall next to the dashboard.  The plates passed the cable ... <br><br>  Sometimes basic knowledge of how the Internet works and the device you use to access it helps save a lot of nerves and time.  The real case, said fellow, or rather, already a former fellow of technical support in Severodvinsk.  On the street - the storm and the storm.  People call and yell, where is my satellite Internet ..?  why not?  and where does the storm ...?  Feyspalm.  You say thank you for not cutting off the light and the phone is still working ... !!! <br><br>  And how many people are sure that the OS and the browser are one and the same.  And that the Internet should work with negative balance.  And that this is exactly ‚ÄúYour installers climbed in the dashboard and turned off the light for me!‚Äù - ‚ÄúDid you ask them for the documents ...?‚Äù - ‚ÄúNo, but why ...?‚Äù Indeed ... <br><br>  It is not surprising that the operators on the first incoming line do not stay long.  To tolerate rudeness and sometimes elementary stupidity of people who make the same mistakes, pour in the same type of threats, ask to write off the debt (yes, it's simple, sorry for a young mother ...?) - not an easy job.  And to make such calls directly to technical support specialists is not the best option.  Because if students and graduates without experience still tolerate rudeness in order to gain experience, then steep specialists are unlikely. <br><br>  Returning to the customer.  You are our dear, do you really think.  what exactly are you for your provider - priceless ..?  Of course, our marketers do their best to convince you of this.  But let's face the harsh truth.  If we are talking about a federal company and a monopolist in this locality ..- then your value and, consequently, satisfaction with the level of services, is very doubtful, alas.  The more retail customers, the less valuable each of them individually.  True, the Internet is becoming cheaper, is not it?  And there are more and more alternatives - an Internet from a tablet, usb-modems, many different operators ... <br><br>  However, the mice cried, pricked, but continued to eat the cactus ... <br><br>  PS The picture reminds that many providers would do well to work on the real quality of services, and not on their advertising. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/9a2/008/0d9/9a20080d96b98f4d1bd0f98087d9af8d.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/291762/">https://habr.com/ru/post/291762/</a></p>
