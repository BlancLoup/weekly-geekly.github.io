  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How much is your name domain</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Once, long ago, when the Internet was not yet developed so universally, I began to register domain names.  Then I did not know why they were me, it was just like a hobby - to invent interesting and sonorous domain names, and to be happy when it turned out to be free.  However, at that time, it was not as difficult as now.  And I have registered especially good options. <br><br>  A little later, I registered a domain with my last name.  Again, I did not know why, for many years I had never used it, even as a mailbox.  But, nevertheless, every year I paid for this list of my domain names. <br><br>  This year, my registrar changed the rules according to which the registration of new domains, and the renewal of old ones became impossible without a passport scan.  I will not explain the reasons for which I did not send the scan in a timely manner ... In general, I woke up on the last day. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      I sent a copy of my passport, and in response I received a message that the domain was already taken by another user. <br><br>  How so?  Who needs him besides me?  Why so fast?  There were a lot of questions. <br><br>  Having entered the address of ‚Äúmy‚Äù site in the browser, I saw some kind of advertisement and the inscription ‚Äú <b>Domain may be for sale</b> ‚Äù, below was the contact e-mail address.  Our dialogue with the new owner was short: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>- Hello, how much do you sell the domain XXXXXXX.ru?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Hello.</i>  <i>Over 30 000 rubles.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Is this the final amount or is it appropriate to bargain?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- It depends on how serious your intentions are to buy and how quickly you are ready to buy it.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Bargaining is possible up to 25-20 thousand per domain, then depends on the speed and method of payment.</i> <br><br>  Further, I told the new owners of the situation, saying that taking into account that there is no PRA TIC, there are no famous people with my name either, and the name itself doesn‚Äôt say, they are unlikely to be able to sell it for 30,000 and said that for 100-200 bucks ready to take it back. <br><br>  In principle, I was completely sure that they would agree.  Well, okay, they would have captured a really interesting copy, and here, after all, the domain, which I don‚Äôt really need, but besides me and my namesakes, the rest aren‚Äôt needed at all.  But I received the answer - " <b>No, thank you</b> ."  On this and went. <br><br>  <b>There are more questions.</b>  The domain was registered as soon as it became free.  So they do it automatically?  Do they register all the vacated domains?  What will they do with it?  How, then, can we agree?  Can offer another, more favorable domain for them to exchange? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/91906/">https://habr.com/ru/post/91906/</a></p>
