Now we have three main types of business - money transfer using electronic wallets, Internet acquiring services and regular payment services (payment of communication services, utility bills, fines, training). <br><br>  In addition to accepting payments by bank cards, PayAnyWay offers the most common ways in RuNet - payment through salons, mail, payment using Internet banking systems and bank accounts, from mobile phone accounts and e-wallets.

      <b>Reasoning</b> <br><br>  There is a difficult task - how to make the client prepay.  How, after all, it is easy to pay on the Internet for mobile communication - the result will be received almost instantly, SMS will come about recharging the balance, i.e.  from the moment of payment to the moment of receiving the service it will take quite a bit of time.  When paying for goods with physical delivery, everything is different.  I don‚Äôt really want to ship the goods to another region without prepayment (this is unlikely to be courier delivery with the ability to receive money at the time of transfer of the goods).  And the buyer does not want to risk money without seeing the goods.  There is a question of customer confidence in the online store.  It (trust) is made up of the following: recommendations from those who have already made purchases at this store;  clear and transparent content on how the buyer will be able to return his money if the goods do not suit him or if he does not receive them;  incentive for the buyer to make an advance payment (for example, receiving a discount). <br>  How to return money to the buyer if he paid for the goods by credit card?  There is a "peaceful" procedure - the buyer must contact the online store and ask for a refund.  It‚Äôs enough for an online store to enter our personal account with us and initiate a return operation with one ‚Äúclick‚Äù; the money will be returned in a short time - usually 1-3 days.  There is a ‚Äúmilitary‚Äù procedure - if the online store refuses to return the money, the buyer must contact his bank and write a statement of return (chargeback).  The bank that issued the card will launch a more complex review procedure, according to the results of which the money will also be returned to the cardholder.  In this case, the money will be returned by us, our relationship with the online store will remain behind the ‚Äúframe‚Äù.  The only thing - the return period in this case will be 1-2 months.  The money will be refunded if it is not proved that the online store has fulfilled its obligations to the buyer. <br>  All this is necessary to tell the buyer so that he is not afraid to pay. <br>  Payment by card is actually quite a safe tool for the payer. <br>  We take very serious measures to ensure this security, we check every store at the connection stage, we monitor all operations very carefully every day, we do everything so that the buyer does not suffer.  And we insist that all the necessary information about the refund procedure be on the online store website.  In order to facilitate this task to the online store, we have made several typical information blocks, from which you can ‚Äúglue‚Äù necessary and sufficient content about payment methods, money back procedures, claim handling rules, and contact details of the online store. <br><br>  <b>Different</b> <br><br>  The project ‚ÄúSitepokupok.ru‚Äù.  The main task that we solved for this project is to provide a billing service on an Internet site that attracts buyers and sellers.  The site itself does not sell anything, it allows the buyer to choose the goods supplied by the sellers, and pay for it, organizes the issuance of the paid goods through their own shopping centers or remote delivery.  We provide an opportunity to replenish the buyer's accounts, transfer money from the buyer to the seller, from one user to another user, provide a convenient refund, keep a history of operations.  We give the opportunity to pay other services from the buyer's account - communications, utilities, fines, kindergartens, training.  Additional services can be paid by credit card, and not only from the internal account of the project, and registration on the service is not required. <br><br>  Sitepokupok designs, improves service, deals with delivery logistics, marketing, i.e.  concentrates on its business.  And we take into account money, provide all users of the site with money management tools, like a credit institution, while ensuring the absolute legality of financial transactions, and provide additional payment services. <br>  We save the site from the need to spend time and bear the costs of maintaining financial accounting. <br>  Today we have two standard solutions for online projects to provide a billing platform: <br>  1. Simplified billing for projects with internal accounts, without the ability to pay in favor of third parties.  Payment can be made only to the address of the online store. <br>  2. Full-fledged billing for projects with internal accounts, with the ability to perform any financial operations with money, in accordance with the restrictions established by the Internet project and current legislation. <br><br>  <b>We connect</b> <br><br>  The procedure for connection and verification of compliance with our conditions is fully automated.  After registration, the service will tell you what to do to fulfill our conditions.  They are not complicated, they are few.  I repeat once again: our requirements are dictated by the need to correctly inform the potential buyer about the terms of payment, their implementation significantly increases loyalty to the online store.  We do not need documents when we connect)). <br><br>  <b>We use</b> <br><br>  Bank cards, payment using banking services, payment via mobile phone stores, e-wallets and SMS.  When we talk about payment using banking services, we mean the technology of invoicing to the Internet bank.  The customer does not need to enter the purchase data, the bank details of the seller - an invoice for payment with all the data will be available in the Internet bank immediately after placing the order.  Payment via salons is convenient for customers who use cash to pay - when placing an order, we will send its number, which will need to be told to the operator in the communication salon, pay, payment information will be available to the online store immediately after it is made. <br>  It‚Äôs possible not to write a lot about payment from wallets - there‚Äôs hardly a person who doesn‚Äôt know what it is. <br>  Small amounts up to 100 rubles.  more willingly pay from mobile phone bills.  If the amount is greater, the distribution is as follows: payment by bank cards is approximately 70-80%.  Another 15% - banking services.  All other payment methods are distributed evenly over the remaining 5-15%. <br>  The method of payment greatly depends on the specifics of the online store, but in the first place, all the stores will have bank cards. <br><br>  <b>We charge</b> <br><br>  The basic commission rate when paying with a card that we charge from an online project is 2.9%.  If the total amount of accepted payments is more than 1 million rubles.  per month the rate is set at 2.7%. <br>  There is always the opportunity to discuss individual rates. <br>  For other methods of payment rates can be found on the website payanyway.ru <br><br>  <b>Do not limit</b> <br><br>  We receive money from the cards of individual countries in agreement with the online store.  This is due to security.  Agree, it will be strange if they try to buy felt boots from a card issued in Papua New Guinea from a Russian online store?  Is the payer in Japan?  With the subsequent sending of boots to Honduras?  If the online store thinks that this is a normal situation for it - we will turn it on. <br><br>  <b>We report</b> <br><br>  We have reports on operations with the status of each operation for any period of time, with uploading to accounting systems. <br>  In your personal account, you can see all transactions online, make return transactions, generate reports, create invoices, send them by e-mail, etc. <br>  If there are several Internet projects, you can keep separate records for each of them, this is the standard functionality of a personal account. <br><br>  <b>Looking to the future</b> <br><br>  In our view, in a few years offline trade will be an exhibition of the achievements of the national economy.  He came in, measured his shoes or looked at how the refrigerator works and left.  And then I ordered and bought over the Internet at producer prices on the manufacturer‚Äôs website.  Or in the online service that sells at producer prices.  And, most likely, the production will be able to ensure the release of goods individually for each customer.  They will buy through the Internet, because of this, logistics and delivery times will change dramatically.  Offline trading will remain for spontaneous or urgent purchases.  The only question is when will it be: in ten years or twenty?  What will be is inevitable.  A vivid example is the airline market: there are now airlines that can buy a ticket only via the Internet.  The transformation of the ways of buying goods by analogy with the acquisition of services will inevitably occur. <br><br>  <b>Getting ready</b> <br><br>  A few more years and smartphones finally supplant the classic mobile phones.  In a smartphone, all information that is present on a bank card can be available - information about its number, CVV, card validity period, a smartphone can support a data exchange interface over short distances (for example, NFC).  And besides, there is, of course, a powerful feedback tool, not only is the smartphone personalized, it also has the ability to determine the location of its owner, all this is a sufficient condition for creating the ‚Äúright‚Äù personalized loyalty system. <br>  There is a huge "empty" segment of the market for payments using a smartphone - food shops, cafes and restaurants, gas stations.  You come to the grocery store, pick up the basket, pass by the cash register, money is written off your card (account), the turnstile opens, you leave the store.  And on the phone will come a list of purchases.  Or does not open, do not leave, pay the usual prehistoric method. <br>  We want to move in that direction.  It is interesting, we have all the necessary knowledge and technologies, how to do it. <br><br>  That's about it - in detail next time. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/240895/">https://habr.com/ru/post/240895/</a></p>
