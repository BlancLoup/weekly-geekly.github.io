      And this is a bookkeeping lesson at the Moscow Commercial School, a photograph from the jubilee edition of 1904. There they are, on the teacher's desk. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7b1/5e4/47a/7b15e447ac325a6fc22ffc48d1efaf89.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Another well-known educational institution is the Moscow Practical Academy of Commercial Sciences.  Also from the jubilee edition, but already from 1910. The teacher is a very famous person in accounting circles: Alexander Vasilyevich Prokofiev, the author of the course in double-entry bookkeeping, reprinted at least twenty times (well, boring, probably!). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/db4/8f2/596/db48f2596c58cf6b0d15b7b8d4947781.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And this is the audience of the St. Petersburg higher commercial accounting and railway courses of Mikhail Vladimirovich Pobedinsky, also a very famous person.  Somewhere in 1914 or a little earlier.  On the tables, of course, accounts - where without them? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/264/08e/49f/26408e49f81e2052aef4722c002e1226.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The revolution did away with the royal educational institutions, but was unable to do away with the Russian accounts.  Look, the bills on the tables of the workers of Chrezuchet - there was such an office in Petrograd, which intended to take into account all the property of the revolutionary city down to the last nail. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/346/1a6/608/3461a6608903584f68a5c27109de95fd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  One of the few non-covered revolutions of educational institutions were Yekaterinoslav courses "Polyglot".  An indulgence came out because courses were formed literally several days before the October Revolution.  Photo from the anniversary edition of 1927 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e9d/737/685/e9d73768594001ded1fdb63a1f084703.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Of course, the accounts used not only in the educational process, but also in practice. <br>  Picture from an accounting journal (which, not to mention, the end of the 1920s).  In general, if the artist wanted to draw an accountant, he painted a man with bills, and everything became clear. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c39/6a1/898/c396a18982b1934d036c351183635504.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And this is the account office of the Leningrad Regional Industrial Economic College, 1928. Accountants are trained. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fce/d16/f02/fced16f022828fcf287442a63d8a3cdc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The above-mentioned courses "Polyglot", but a few years later and renamed the Azov-Black Sea Training Complex.  On the right hand of future accountants - Russian accounts, and on the left - calculators.  The competition between gadgets is in full swing, and its outcome is completely unclear. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/104/0e0/2ef/1040e02ef068a62fc1d3f45d648065c5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A picture from a book from 1929. The book was called ‚ÄúWhat is the use of records and calculations in the household‚Äù and told about how an intelligent man wrote down his operations in a notebook and he had a type-top, and his short-sighted neighbor laughed and teased until he was left at the broken trough. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/58f/c27/9db/58fc279db13df80a342031b40ce7cb4a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The following drawings of the mid-1930s, on the subject of agricultural accounting, but not one-man but collective-farm.  Trend, you know.  From the journal "Accounting in socialist agriculture." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/725/a97/3eb/725a973eb455ab0c6c6f7c2c6dbcd674.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/46a/c45/cc0/46ac45cc0291fbffe8db2ac9ef6e15f5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In 1935, the journal ‚ÄúAccounting in Socialist Agriculture‚Äù was renamed ‚ÄúAccounting and Finance on Collective Farms‚Äù.  New computing equipment was stepping on its heels, but photographs of accountants with invoices continued to be regularly published.  Here are a lot of them, and this is only from my collection, a minuscule of the total number, clicked by restless Soviet photo reporters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ff4/061/573/ff4061573e7a92ea25b07440b8cfcf82.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ea1/34b/959/ea134b959a476b17f0da94bc60ff5b9f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/020/c26/23b/020c2623bb6db6d757c7638f7752bee4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ae5/3d3/2d8/ae53d32d8a1dd77ddf29745fad354c99.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2b1/7b0/256/2b17b0256e2014dc8b63a5adb4bf9f68.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And finally, a photo from the magazine ‚ÄúSputnik Bookkeeper‚Äù from 1932, also on agricultural topics.  Collective farm brigadier counts workdays. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3b0/dc3/41b/3b0dc341b96b46c55003faca9c449dce.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Actually that's all.  A few decades later, smuggling personalities from China appeared, and accountants healed like white people, for their own pleasure. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/174805/">https://habr.com/ru/post/174805/</a></p>
