      We are trying to keep track of new trends and technologies used for work in data centers.  Recently, an interesting idea caught my eye - using the ‚Äúwearable‚Äù mini-PC Google Glass for data center employees.  As it turned out, there are several directions where this gadget can be successfully used. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Here are some points.  into which the main idea is broken: <br><br>  <b>1. The evolution of work tasks</b> <br><br>  Voice commands may become commonplace for data center workers.  "OK Glass", "confirm task execution", "task completed", "show previous task", "add video", "add photo". <br><br>  Neither the pen nor the keyboard will need to be recorded. <br>  working data, and fix the necessary data will be on the job. <br><br>  In addition, daily service tasks will be displayed for each member of the data center team, so no additional reminders are required.  At the beginning of his shift, he put on glasses, and immediately see what needs to be done and when. <br><br>  Maps of individual rooms, placement of equipment and the necessary equipment - all this will also be displayed directly on the display, and you can get to the desired room / node by a virtual map. <br><br>  Employees will be able to record actions performed on video, and attach these videos / photos to the records of completed work.  Another worker, if necessary, will be able to view such videos, studying, or checking the correctness of the sequence of the procedure performed. <br><br>  <b>2. Quick identification of nodes and elements</b> <br><br>  Each new part or working unit can be supplied with a barcode, and the points in real time will identify all of this (as an example, you can take a picture of the identification of the environment from ‚ÄúTerminator-2‚Äù). <br><br>  It will also be possible, ‚Äúwithout departing from the cash register,‚Äù to order from the warehouse the necessary parts for replacement, immediately marking the failed components and components. <br><br>  <b>3. Heat map in real time</b> <br><br>  Equipment failures often occur due to overheating of individual items of equipment.  In the case of using Google Glass, employees can see the temperature distribution map in the room (heat map) and immediately respond in case of imbalance. <br><br>  Perhaps, in the future, glasses will be equipped with an infrared sensor, which will be more than useful to data center employees. <br><br>  <b>4. Advanced visualization of statistical data</b> <br><br>  A team of engineers, in addition to the heat map, will be able to receive visualization of certain processes in real time, which will also allow for more efficient operation. <br><br>  How can you not remember the picture from the "Matrix", where strange icons run across the screen, and the fighter immediately realizes what is happening, where and how.  Of course, this is not a completely correct comparison, but an analogy can be made. <br><br>  <b>5. Unified Messaging Center and Task Manager</b> <br><br>  This is a universal opportunity that can be used not only by data center employees.  It is about reducing all messages related to a specific task to a single SMS message center, twitter, email, all the necessary messages can be displayed by Google Glass. <br><br>  You can also send them centrally. <br><br>  In addition, glasses can also be used to make video calls when a problem arises, where discussion is needed, without interrupting the performance of the main task. <br><br>  <b>6. Increased team mobility</b> <br><br>  From all the above, we can single out another possibility: no need for data center engineers to sit and look at their monitors in the workplace.  All data can be obtained "on the go", so that support becomes much more mobile and efficient. <br><br>  <b>When will all this be possible?</b> <br><br>  Actually, there are only two problems - the current limitations of the gadget itself, Google Glass, as well as the lack of necessary applications. <br><br>  Probably, as soon as the glasses themselves will be sold everywhere, the development of the necessary applications is a matter of a couple of months. <br><br>  So everything described above can become a reality in the next year or two.  Of course, such "glasses" will be able to use not only data center employees, but also brokers, industry workers, financiers and others. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/208798/">https://habr.com/ru/post/208798/</a></p>
