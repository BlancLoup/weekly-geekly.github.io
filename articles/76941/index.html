As soon as one of the doors is closed, the site is transformed and adapted to survive and, perhaps, even remain legal.  Does the site seem to be getting harder and harder to cover? <br><br>  Many would have thought that Pirate Bay could not stand in the face of a powerful onslaught organized by the joint forces of the music and film industry. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  And so, on the eve of December, the site remains open.  In the entire history of BitTorrent networks, not a single site experienced so many disasters and did not overcome so many obstacles, while continuing to dominate.

      Most of the torrent sites, only slightly flaunt before the threats of the right holders, and then close on demand, but not the Pirate Bay. <br><br>  A powerful raid in 2006 caused the loss of a huge amount of equipment; this alone would be enough to break the will of a smaller site.  But after a few days the site was restored, periodically changing the hosts and the country in order to avoid fatal injuries. <br><br>  Earlier this year, the 2006 raid bore fruit in the form of finding the owners of the site guilty, sentencing them to fines and imprisonment.  But even these events did not scare the largest torrent tracker.  While the appeal is waiting for a decision, hope is alive. <br><br>  Even the promised fines could not harm the site or its operators.  Could the authorities find any capital owned by the site owners?  Never.  Even the site itself was transferred to the new owners - Reservella based on the Seychelles. <br><br>  The threats to the site host also turned out to be meaningless, since the company was owned by Fredrik Neu.  But, nevertheless, the authorities began to put pressure on the Internet provider, threatening him with fines, if he did not disconnect the website from the Internet. <br><br>  And the site fell again.  As expected, a few hours later he was back in the ranks with a new provider.  After 20 minutes, a new hoster began to be threatened from Hollywood.  Having lost this host, Pirate Bay went east and got up again.  Again and again. <br><br>  However, the enemies of the site have already hatched a new plan. <br><br>  After the Bay partially moved to Ukraine, in October the Danish anti-piracy group BREIN found a new slot in the armor.  Traffic to the site was routed through the Netherlands using Nforce, a LeaseWeb consumer.  Nforce quickly complied with the BREIN requirements, and the Pirate Group fell again, of course, not for long. <br><br>  Then, in late October, the Stockholm District Court struck almost a crushing blow, banning Gottfried Svartholm and Fredrik Neiju from administering the site under the threat of a $ 71,000 fine for disobedience.  And this decision is toothless. <br><br>  Pirate Bay is no longer located in Sweden (and no longer controls the tracker), which creates problems for Swedish courts.  The seas of blood mentioned in the decision also became ephemeral. <br><br>  Two creators have filed an appeal, and both deny that they are managing the site at the moment, as they have transferred it to others.  Fredrik aka TiAMO has been living in Thailand for some time.  And Gottfried aka Anakata can be found sleeping throughout the day, and managing his computers at night in the jungles of Cambodia.  The location of both is a serious problem for the Swedish solution. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm wondering if the Swedish court can prohibit or punish a website located in another country and my papers on a website that doesn‚Äôt exist in Sweden signed in another country,‚Äù Fredrik said this week commenting on the situation. <br><br>  Thus, the site banned in Sweden is located outside of its borders.  Moreover, since the site no longer has a tracker, it becomes even less responsible for other people's violations.  This paves the way for the lifting of the ban on the site. <br><br>  Site owners who have been banned from managing it in Sweden say that they no longer control it.  They don't live in Sweden anyway. <br><br>  Meanwhile, the site continues to work.  Despite the fact that it is not known what the next step of the anti-piracy groups will be, one thing is almost certain that the Pirate Bay will respond and not be offended. <br><br>  One day it will disappear, there is no doubt, but it will happen when the creators themselves decide, and not by somebody's orders. <br><br>  <b>Translation</b> : <a href="http://ipv6.nnm-club.ru/forum/profile.php%3Fmode%3Dviewprofile%26u%3D80883">Anarki4</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/76941/">https://habr.com/ru/post/76941/</a></p>
