      In the Russian Federation, there is a single state cinema ticket registration system (UAIS) in which all cinemas should transmit data on all tickets sold by them.  The state fund of cinema manages such a system, cinema data is open, so that they are the main source of data on the cinema market in the country. <br><br>  And these data suggest that the market has changed a lot in recent years.  More and more viewers are watching movies online - on relevant web services, plus using Apple and Google catalogs.  Film companies in Russia are unhappy that online cinemas convey to producers, including Russian copyright holders, only a small part of the data on movies and TV shows. <br><br>  Therefore, it is proposed to launch a system of accounting for Internet views.  The viewers counter Minkult and producers propose to make mandatory for all legal online cinemas that work in runet. <br><br>  Online services that do not install the counter will be considered illegal - in any case, the authors of initiatives count on this.  The scheme will allow you to remove links to such services from the search engines.  If the initiative is approved, the Ministry of Culture will develop appropriate amendments to the legislation. <br><br>  Media executives claim that the data on free viewing and buying TV shows and movies on the Internet is very important for producers and television channels.  It is necessary to understand how to make money online, as well as how the Internet audience perceives those or other pictures, how its perception differs from the perception of the audience in cinemas.  Ideally, according to the authors of the system, right holders should get access to data on Internet shows not only of their content, but also in the market as a whole. <br><br>  The data obtained will be used to strengthen the position of producers in negotiations with cinemas.  Now representatives of the domestic film industry believe that payments to online cinemas are too small compared to payments to suppliers of foreign content.  Owners of online services do not agree, saying that payments to specific producers are largely dependent on the demand for content. <br><br>  Before the meeting, representatives of the Film and Television Producers Association (APCT) submitted proposals for launching the system to a number of online cinemas. <br><br>  The description of the new system states that the ‚Äúmeter‚Äù of sales of films and serials on the Internet is a Russian development, software that collects in real time data on sales and viewing of content.  Among the data that producers expect to receive are, for example, the number of purchases of a particular movie or series, the number of views, the place of viewing, the place of purchase, data about the viewer's device (ie, it is a computer, smartphone or smart TV). <br><br>  According to producers, the installation of meters does not require significant efforts and costs from online services. <br><br>  The discussion of the project mentioned above began after November 2018, when APKit Volin held a meeting with the participation of producers and online cinemas regarding the possibility of launching an Internet viewing accounting system.  Online cinemas then agreed to start the transfer of at least some of the data that the producers requested. <br><br>  But then it was said that no legislative changes would be required, plus the online cinemas were going to use a very specific system - the counter of Nielsen analytical company.  At the same time, representatives of online services stated that they only agreed to develop a possible approach to data transfer. <br><br><blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jy/sd/rr/jysdrr7tqgfjt50wtcshw89ctho.png" align="left"><h3>  Minute of care from UFO </h3><br>  This material could cause contradictory feelings, so before writing a comment, refresh something important in your memory: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">How to write a comment and survive</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  Do not write abusive comments, do not go to the person. </li><li>  Refrain from using obscene language and toxic behavior (even in a veiled form). </li><li>  To report comments that violate the rules of the site, use the "Report" button (if available) or <a href="https://habr.com/feedback/%3Ftype%3D4">a feedback form</a> . </li></ul><br>  What to do if: <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/karma/">minus karma</a> |  <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/sandbox/">blocked account</a> <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/other/">Code of authors Habra</a> and <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/other/">habraetiket</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/rules/">Full site rules</a> </div></div></blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/443916/">https://habr.com/ru/post/443916/</a></p>
