The total prize fund of this competition for all nominations was 560,000 euros.  And it has existed in Germany for 10 years, since 2009. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yk/5e/gy/yk5egyrfhxorq9et3x2pomjbzhg.jpeg" alt="Tinytouchtales in German Games Award 2018" title="Tinytouchtales in German Games Award 2018"><br><br>  <i>Tinytouchtales awarding the German Games Award 2018 [ <a href="http://www.tinytouchtales.com/2018/04/15/german-games-award/">2</a> ]</i>

    <h3>  0. Objectives of the article </h3><br><ul><li>  Satisfying curiosity - who gets these prizes?  How big should they have a team, and how ambitious should a project be? </li><li>  Get an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow the development of the gaming industry, applied (including at the state level) in countries occupying a prominent position in the industry. </li><li>  So, looking at these amounts in the competition, it would be more reasonable to speak about the seriousness of this not always serious occupation. </li><li>  And even, perhaps, we will also have something similar official with a reliable, trusted system of selection and refereeing.  After all, we have periodically adopt Western traditions. </li></ul><br>  Here I will analyze the sources of this money, as well as consider, for which such money is given out.  And to whom. <br><br>  Here, by the way, many beloved <i>Piranha Bytes was</i> lit up ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  1. Where does the money come from? </h3><br>  The prize prize of the German Computer Game Award (GCGA) was not always that big.  In 2009 it was a modest 150.000 euros, and only by 2018 it grew to 560.000 euros [ <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutscher_Computerspielpreis">3</a> ].  In rough terms, it is 39.200.000 rubles.  The money comes from the industry "Association of the German Games Industry" in conjunction with the "Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure."  That is, the money comes from business and from the state. <br><br>  In fact, 140.000 euros from the news company Computec Media Group, which spends this money on media promotion of the winners of some nominations, also go to the amount of this amount.  However, the organization is modestly silent about this bonus and in all press releases the figure is 560,000, not 700,000 [ <a href="https://deutscher-computerspielpreis.de/presse/deutscher-computerspielpreis-2018-das-sind-die-besten-deutschen-computerspiele">1</a> ]. <br><br><h3>  2. What is the official purpose of the organizers? </h3><br>  The goal of the German Computer Game Award is to promote Germany as a business place in the development of digital games and interactive entertainment software.  In particular, the focus is on innovative, culturally and pedagogically valuable games in order to create an incentive for the development of high-quality, attractive computer games in Germany and thereby increase the diversity of such games in Germany. <br><br><h3>  3. Who can apply? </h3><br>  Only games that were developed by at least 80% in Germany can participate in the competition.  There are nominations for different gaming platforms (PCs, browser-based, mobile), international and local, in support of pupils and students.  Games must be published in the last calendar year or must be published before June 30 in the year of the award.  It is allowed to submit even concepts, prototypes and demo versions of games, if they are published [ <a href="https://deutscher-computerspielpreis.de/preis/faq">4</a> ]. <br><br><h3>  4. Awards and nominations </h3><br>  The award ceremony took place on April 10, 2018 in Munich [ <a href="https://deutscher-computerspielpreis.de/presse/deutscher-computerspielpreis-2018-das-sind-die-besten-deutschen-computerspiele">1</a> ].  This event was very poorly covered outside Germany, and even English-speaking Wikipedia knows much less about its competition than its German neighbor. <br>  In addition to a brief presentation of games, he also added brief information about developers [ <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutscher_Computerspielpreis">3</a> ]. <br><br>  1) The <b>best German game</b> ( <i>110.000 Euro + 60.000</i> media bonus) <br>  <b>Witch It</b> [ <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/559650/Witch_It/">5</a> ] <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zy/hb/ni/zyhbniqkgboi7yv3k4elkxaomrs.jpeg"><br><br>  (Developer: Barrel Roll Games, Hamburg). <br><br>  In short - this is multiplayer hide and seek.  The final publication is scheduled for the end of 2018. <br><br>  Barrel Roll Games is a young company (since 2017), consisting of only 5 people [ <a href="http://www.barrelrollgames.com/">6</a> ].  True, their game is being developed with the publisher Daedalic Entertainment, so this is no longer an indie with a small letter (but it depends a lot on taste). <br><br>  2) The <b>best children's game</b> ( <i>75 000 euros + 40 000</i> media bonus) <br>  <b>Monkey Swag</b> [ <a href="https://tinycrocodilestudios.de/treasure-monkeys/">7</a> ] <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kf/y1/gf/kfy1gfmrrlxlm612irnyiwko5l4.jpeg"><br><br>  (Developer: Tiny Crocodile Studios / kunst-stoff, Berlin. <br><br>  Monkey Swag is a children's game with a solution to puzzles, mostly geometric. <br>  The debut project was developed by another young company (since 2017), whose composition is about 5 people.  Here, too, was not without producer: United Soft Media.  [ <a href="https://tinycrocodilestudios.de/treasure-monkeys/">7</a> ]. <br><br>  I was able to contact one of the studio owners: Johanna Janiszewski (CEO and Creative Director).  She may be able to come in here and answer some community questions in the comments, if any. <br><br>  My questions about how many competitors they had, how many participants there were, and whether there were any bureaucratic difficulties, Johanna answered: <br><blockquote>  We had two more competitors on the best kid's game.  I don‚Äôt have any insights into the nomination process as well.  It was quite easy to register, it was a trailer and a playable version of course.  He was cool, we got cool, we got nominated, oh my gosh, we won!  Tell them.  There was lots of answering emails, interviews and paperwork afterwards.  Tv news here in germany. </blockquote><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Translation answer</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  We had two more competitors for the Best Children's Game.  I have no idea about the nomination process.  Registration was pretty simple, we had to send a quick review of the game, a trailer and a working version of the game, of course.  So for me it was like this: well, we signed up for participation, hey, cool, we were nominated, let's go to the event itself, oh my gosh, we won!  We should call everyone and tell them.  After that there were a lot of emails, interviews and paperwork.  We even got into one, two television news programs in Germany. <br></div></div><br>  3) The <b>best youth game</b> ( <i>75 000 euro + 40 000</i> media bonus) <br>  <b>Witch It</b> [ <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/559650/Witch_It/">5</a> ] <br>  <i>This is the second nomination of the game.</i> <br><br>  4) The <b>best serious game</b> ( <i>40 000</i> euros) <br>  <b>Vocabicar</b> [ <a href="https://verlage.westermanngruppe.de/diesterweg/reihe/VOCABICAR/Vocabicar">8</a> ] <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1a/rb/wa/1arbwakusydyyahofuujdd3o2dk.jpeg"><br><br>  (Developer: Quantumfrog, Oldenburg). <br><br>  This is a childish game for learning English. <br><br>  The developer company is no longer a novice with 7 years of experience and a team of 17 people [ <a href="https://www.quantumfrog.de/">9</a> ]. <br><br>  5) The <b>best mobile game</b> ( <i>40 000</i> euros) <br>  <b>Card Thief</b> [ <a href="http://www.card-thief.com/">10</a> ] <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_f/zp/hh/_fzphh_eyfv4espmp5loxxajywe.jpeg"><br><br>  (Developer: Arnold Rowers / Tinytouchtales, Berlin). <br><br>  This is a logical "card" game for mobile devices.  Very stylish graphics and animations.  It was because of her and it was decided to make this review. <br><br>  In general, this game was developed by 3 people, about which the authors themselves write on their website of the studio Tinytouchtales.  Their game also won in the nomination "Best Game Design" in the competition German Developer Awards 2017 [ <a href="http://www.tinytouchtales.com/2018/04/15/german-games-award/">2</a> ].  Here is what the developers write about the jury of the contest in their blog: <br><blockquote> This is a trick for the card reader. </blockquote><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Transfer</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The jury in the German Developer Contest is a mix of professionals, amateurs and people (mostly politicians) who never play games, so it was especially hard for us to win with Card Thief. <br></div></div><br>  By the way, a special thank you to Arnold, who provided me with links to German publications, because  in English, the event was covered very poorly (I could not find the details). <br><br>  6) The <b>best design of the game</b> ( <i>40 000</i> euros) <br>  <b>TownsmenVR</b> [ <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/749960/Townsmen_VR/">11</a> ] <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/q8/f3/qp/q8f3qpwvbkr0o8c-myxwaa7hthm.jpeg"><br>  (Developer: Handy Games, Giebelstadt) [ <a href="https://www.handy-games.com/en/">12</a> ] <br>  TownsmenVR is a god simulator for creating and developing your city with a view from a VR eye and running a punishing hand.  They also have Townsmen without VR, similar to the usual construction of the city with pauses for actions.  That is, a standard, solidly made day-pumping pump from users who have sat down, mostly on mobile devices.  I perceive it as a greatly improved "farm".  As far as they are alike, I don‚Äôt know, maybe someone will clarify this question in the comments. <br><br>  Handy Games - An experienced developer of a very large number of games, mostly mobile, but there are also PC games with VR.  The team consists of approximately 50 people. <br><br>  7) <b>Best innovations</b> ( <i>40,000</i> euros) <br>  <b>HUXLEY</b> [ <a href="https://exit-vr.de/berlin/das-spiel/">13</a> ] <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ho/xz/6o/hoxz6osaszniu_cqfpf_suweotm.jpeg"><br><br>  (Developer: Exit Adventures, Berlin) [ <a href="https://exit-vr.de/berlin/das-spiel/">13</a> ] <br>  HUXLEY is a virtual multiplayer quest room with a common task ‚ÄúFind a way out‚Äù. <br>  The developers are a young team of 15 people ( <i>judging by the photos they have posted, they work in an office decorated for an abandoned storage room</i> ). <br><br>  8) The <b>best production</b> ( <i>40 000</i> euro) <br>  <b>The Long Journey Home</b> [ <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/366910/">14</a> ] <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/i9/lm/im/i9lmimeg941mdoqhh1s7vhui7mq.jpeg"><br><br>  (Developer: Daedalic Entertainment, D√ºsseldorf) [ <a href="https://www.daedalic.com/">15</a> ] <br>  The Long Journey Home - in the procedure-generated world, a team of travelers lost in space is looking for a way home, solving the quests of encountered aliens along the way. <br>  Daedalic is a fairly well-known publishing house / developer, with a lot of lights since 2007, with 80 employees.  In their piggy bank as publishers there are still relatively well-known games: Machinarium;  Tales of Monkey Island;  Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun;  Witch It (the one that won all here).  As developers: The Pillars of the Earth;  State of Mind. <br><br>  So, if you look, many of the winning games in this competition are closely tied to this publisher.  It looks like they know exactly what is needed for victories in such an event, and it is these competencies that the average developer wants from his publisher. <br><br>  9) The <b>best international game</b> (no money was given here) <br>  <b>Assassin's Creed Origins</b> [ <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/ru-ru/game/assassins-creed-origins">16</a> ] <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ol/9_/7y/ol9_7yhtkvcyhtmkvlt-i4zvija.jpeg"><br><br>  (Developer: Ubisoft). <br><br>  Well, about this giant in the field of game development so everyone knows.  The competition was held thanks to a large branch in Germany, although it is considered a French company. <br><br>  10) The <b>best international gaming world</b> (no money was given here) <br>  <b>Horizon Zero Dawn</b> [ <a href="https://www.guerrilla-games.com/play/horizon">17</a> ] <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nu/gs/fq/nugsfq6hmh7kjjv2qvfmpx_ai-4.jpeg"><br><br>  (Developer: Guerrilla Games / Sony Interactive Germany) [ <a href="https://www.guerrilla-games.com/play/horizon">17</a> ]. <br><br>  Horizon Zero Dawn is an open-world action RPG where cyborgs (robots) have all been filled long ago.  However, the main heroine of all the dangers are not terrible, because she has her faithful bow and arrows. <br><br>  The company has been operating since 2000 and employs about 270 people.  Now working under the wing of Sony Computer Entertainment. <br><br>  11) The <b>best international multiplayer game</b> (no money was given here) <br>  <b>Witch It</b> [ <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/559650/Witch_It/">5</a> ] <br>  <i>And this is the 3rd nomination for the same game.</i> <br><br>  12) <b>The reward of young talents for the concept</b> (fund <i>50 000</i> euros) <br>  12.1) <b>Ernas Unheil</b> (1st place and <i>35,000</i> euros) [ <a href="http://www.aileen-auerbach.de/ernas-unheil/">18</a> ] <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jh/ep/aw/jhepawewabgt1pqaqair8y0yx6i.jpeg"><br><br>  Eileen Auerbach, Jessica Bodamer, Lisa Forsch, Olga Trinova, Talea Sikmann / HTW Berlin <br>  Ernas Unheil is an interactive book that, in addition to the standard decision tree for this genre, uses an accelerometer in Android devices ( <i>and seems to additionally require a physical book</i> ).  The game was developed as part of a student project by a group of 4 students and 2 curators. <br><br>  12.2) <b>Sunset Devils</b> (2nd place and <i>15,000</i> euros) [ <a href="https://twitter.com/sunset_devils">19</a> ] <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/id/d2/9s/idd29supl_efu_uawiz7nhe0xas.jpeg"><br><br>  Andreas Illenser / Karl Hofer School, Karlsruhe <br><br>  Sunset Devils is a school project by one author.  The style of the game is pixel art in the spaghetti western genre [ <a href="https://blog.games-career.com/de/gewonnen-und-nun-interview-mit-andreas-illenseer-entwickler-designer-von-sunset-devils/">20</a> ].  Judging by the screenshots - shooter / walker, and judging by the speed of development and the periodic redrawing of already drawn models - long-term construction since 2012, with a significant risk of an eternal alpha version or even a concept.  Although the project can and will be completed after graduation by the author of the school, as he plans. <br><br>  13) <b>The reward of the young talent for the prototype</b> (fund <i>50 000</i> euros) <br>  13.1) <b>Fading Skies</b> (1st place and <i>35,000</i> euros) [ <a href="http://fadingskies.com/">21</a> ] <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vd/df/hk/vddfhkvw7qr-_xnyjmislgh1ofw.jpeg"><br><br>  Marc Fleps / HAW Hamburg <br><br>  Fading Skies is a 3D platformer from a developer solo.  The main focus of the game is on large-scale landscapes and migratory adventures.  Promised yet thoughtful interactive script. <br><br>  13.2) <b>Realm of the Machines</b> (2nd place and <i>15,000</i> euros) [ <a href="https://www.sebastianjantschke.com/portfolio/realm-of-the-machines/">22</a> ] <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cu/im/zr/cuimzr7atptfjf3jnjtz6ehwiri.jpeg"><br><br>  Julian Ludwig, Sebastian Jantke, Stefan Held, Vanusha Nurbachsh, Alina von Petersdorf, Sharon Schwab, Maximilian Michalok, David Ernst, Pascal Marshard / Mediadesign University Munich <br>  Realm of the Machines - 2D puzzle, where the main hero-robot is required to bring mechanisms back to life by attaching gears and conveyor belts to them. <br><br>  This is a study project for the 6th semester at the University of Media Design [ <a href="https://www.sebastianjantschke.com/portfolio/realm-of-the-machines/">22</a> ]. <br><br>  14) <b>Audience Award</b> (no money was given here) <br>  <b>ELEX</b> [ <a href="https://elexgame.com/">23</a> ] <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ss/so/fe/sssofe_kh899x3s2_qumtqyue9w.jpeg"><br><br>  (Developer: <b>Piranha Bytes</b> , Essen). <br><br>  ELEX is Gothic / Risen in post-apocalypse.  Piranhas, as always, created a hand-crafted world. <br><br>  Piranha is a very experienced (and many loved) company that has been operating since 1997.  The company staff is 30 people. <br><br>  Jennifer Pankratz from Piranha Bytes responded to my request for additional information and dropped the link to the video of the event, where they thanked the audience for voting: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Video by Piranha Bytes</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vL0G-gU_GNA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></div></div><br>  By the way, in past years the following games won in this nomination [ <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutscher_Computerspielpreis">3</a> ]: <br>  - 2017, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Blood and Wine <br>  - 2016, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt <br>  - 2015, Dark Souls II <br><br>  15) <b>Special jury prize</b> (no money was given here) <br>  <b>Friendly Fire</b> [ <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendly_Fire_(Charity-Livestream)">24</a> ] <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/r3/as/59r3asvz4ruuoz4dnrxsoeu5y6y.jpeg"><br><br>  This is a project related to charity gaming streams on YouTube (and other venues).  [ <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendly_Fire_(Charity-Livestream)">24</a> ] <br><br><h3>  5. Conclusion </h3><br>  This is how annual game developers in Germany are awarded.  Participants receive official recognition, media attention (albeit more often of a national character).  Students get good bonuses on their resume.  Small developers a chance to earn extra money and light up.  The industry at the expense of this PR will receive more new blood.  It seems to everyone from this good. <br>  I invited some game authors to the discussion of the article, and some expressed a desire to talk a bit.  Perhaps someone will still get to the comments and we can get a little more ‚Äúinsider‚Äù information. <br><br>  Maybe in your countries, too, there are similar contests at the national level.  It would be very curious to know about the conditions of their conduct, allocated budgets and information support. <br><br>  PS I must say that because of the difficulties of translating from German to the article, an error crept in.  Johanna in the comments to the article helped to identify it.  Additional financial prizes in fact were not prizes and did not use "for advertising in the media."  These were Medienboard funds, which are targeted funding / grants for the implementation of a specific future project that has a stated value (in education, for example) and quality.
