First of all I want to thank Sergey Kotyrev for this opportunity. <br><br>  The topic of the seminar was <b>‚ÄúHuman factor in software development‚Äù</b> <br><br>  I will tell about one interesting ambiguous method for recruiting in IT.  I will also share my feelings received after the seminar. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So about the method:

      Yordon suggested (according to him, personally tested and successful) one of the methods for selecting high-quality personnel in IT.  The essence of the technique was that before the interview candidates were offered to demonstrate their skills and experience in the office of the company.  Those.  they explained to the person that, having come for an interview, he would have to make a small presentation about himself, his skills, and his last works (this is important enough for the narrator to speak about his last works). <br>  The most important point was that the presentation was appreciated not only by colleagues from the personnel department, but directly by the team members themselves, who will have to work with them.  After (and in some cases during the presentation) they rendered a verdict. <br>  What are the advantages: <br><ul><li>  team participation, a very important moment in the process of forming a project team; </li><li>  saving (talking about calendar days) time by reducing the number of interviews conducted (to the opposite example: according to Romuald Zdebsky, he had to go through as many as 7 interviews and 3 tests before he got a place at Microsoft); </li><li>  the experience of each observer in the aggregate gave a more objective picture </li></ul><br><br>  But I was a little surprised that after the coffee break, to the question of staff hunger in the states - Edward Iordon explained that they have no such problems.  Then it became finally clear to me that this approach in staff selection is most effective only with enough / excess personnel in the IT market, or only in large, very large companies like Google.  I want to immediately say that this is only my personal understanding of this approach. <br>  <i>Further I suggest to discuss all together.</i> <br><br>  At the end of the seminar, I had an ambiguous feeling.  I realized that I had a lot of knowledge, I need to grow to others (this makes me happy), still others lead to deeper reflections and careful steps to scale, taking into account our geographic personalities, views and other features.  There was a lot of information, and no matter how much I wanted to share it with the others now, my strength will not be enough to describe all 120 slides with explanations from the author himself) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/40624/">https://habr.com/ru/post/40624/</a></p>
