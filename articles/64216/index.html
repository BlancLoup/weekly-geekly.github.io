It will be about computer security competitions.  In Russia. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <em>Some background information:</em> <br><br>  CTF is a team competition, the purpose of which is to assess the ability of participants to attack and defend computer systems. <br>  Each team is given a server (image for a virtual), on which there are a number of services (all of them are the same).  Services, as you probably already guessed, have a number of vulnerabilities, intentionally introduced by their developers.  Usually services are written in 5-9 programming languages. <br><br>  The goal of the game is to ensure the efficiency of its services, protect the flags (some information on the server), capture the flags of the enemy.  Ie, in essence, the task comes down to: <br><ul><li>  maintenance of service performance, which is periodically checked by the jury </li><li>  patch development for vulnerability services </li><li>  writing exploits to exploit vulnerabilities, pulling flags from enemy servers. </li></ul><br>  OS on the server, the languages ‚Äã‚Äãin which the services will be written, etc.  unknown in advance. <br>  The competition usually lasts 7-8 hours. <br>  The game is made both locally and remotely via the Internet.

      <em>Actually CTF in Russia:</em> <br><br>  What is worse than a Russian drunken hacker? :) <br>  The following competitions are held in Russia: <br>  UralCTF - since 2006, the severe Ural students and postgraduates of the Ural State University and the national team of Chelyabinsk have been holding regional competitions. <br>  <a href="http://www.hackerdom.ru/CTF/UralCTF">Official site UralCTF.</a> <br><br>  In 2008, with the support of the Ural State University and a number of sponsors, the HackerDom team held the first open inter-university information protection competition RuCTF 2008. Then, 9 teams took part in the competition. <br>  In 2009, 31 teams submitted an application for participation in RuCTF 2009!  The competition was held in two stages.  First, there was a remote qualifying round of RuCTF Quals, based on which 16 teams were selected.  They passed to the main stage of the competition, which took place in person at Ural State University.  The SiBears team won. <br>  <a href="http://www.ructf.org/">Official site RuCTF.</a> <br><br>  On June 27, 2009, the first such competitions took place in TIT SFU - UfoCTF 2009. 4 teams took part.  In one of them was me.  :) <br>  <a href="http://ufoctf.ru/">UfoCTF official site.</a> <br><br>  <em>CTF abroad:</em> <br><br>  They play in CTF for a long time.  At Defcon, the world's largest hacker convention in Las Vegas each year, CTF is one of the most favorite parts. <br>  For example, Defcon 2009 Quals is a remote game that lasts two days.  In fact, it is a qualifying round, the result of which is selected by 9 teams from around the world who go to Las Vegas for an on-site tour.  The lucky ones will visit Defcon'e! <br>  <a href="http://www.kenshoto.com/">Official site of Defcon CTF.</a> <br><br>  CIPHER and UCSB iCTF are also very popular.  Only students and graduate students can take part in them :) Competitions take place remotely via the Internet. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.cipher-ctf.org/">CIPHER official website</a> <br>  <a href="http://ictf.cs.ucsb.edu/">UCSB iCTF official website</a> <br><br>  Now, how do we participate in international online competitions using the example of two teams - HackerDom and SiBears: <br>  Both teams participate in UCSB iCTF, CIPHER and DEFCON. <br><br>  <em>Results:</em> <br><br>  2007, CIPHER (3) - HackerDom 12/26 place. <br>  2008, CIPHER (4) - HackerDom 1/31 place.  SiBears - 21/31. <br>  2009, CIPHER (5) - HackerDom 2/34 place.  SiBears - 5/34 place. <br>  2006 UCSB iCTF - HackerDom 19/25 <br>  2007 UCSB iCTF - HackerDom 3/36, SiBears - 10/36. <br>  2008 UCSB iCTF - Sibears 2/39, HackerDom - 4/39. <br>  2008 DEFCON - HackerDom 24/372 <br>  2009 DEFCON - 50/224 HackerDom, SiBears 55/224 <br><br>  In addition to these two teams, many more teams from Russia participate in the competition.  For example, on CIPHER (5) from 33 teams - 12 Russians.  Soon it will become a Russian competition!  :) <br><br>  <em>Summing up</em> , I can only say that it is damn nice that there is a CTF in Russia and that it is developing!  And damn nice to participate in all this! <br>  At my university, the CTF culture is just emerging ... But we will make every effort to develop this not only at the level of our team, but also at the level of the entire university. <br><br>  PS: This is my first post here, besides, I have never been engaged in blogging, so I would like to hear objective comments so as not to drag errors from post to post in the future.  Additional questions on the topic are welcome.  :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/64216/">https://habr.com/ru/post/64216/</a></p>
