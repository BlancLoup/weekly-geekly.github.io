  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"How to be creative" by Huge MacLeod</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  And so I want to share my impressions of reading these 50 pages. <br>  The author is a wonderful person with an analytical mindset, he sees not only the meter around him but also the general movement in general.  The book is written in rather simple language but not in the language of a boy who only feels it in the language of a person who has gone a long way from the very bottom to, if not the very top, then to a certain summit exactly what this material is actually interesting and what is its merit ... although On the other hand, I think that this is a disadvantage because the author wrote it then when it had already achieved something.  For example, it would be no less interesting for me to read his thoughts, descriptions of attempts to get out into the * light * BEFORE he got out.  In general, these 50 pages contain a lot of advice (but rather persistent, similar to the manual) for any person who is sure of what he thinks, lives, feels, etc., for people who ask themselves questions: who?  Why am I here? ... in general for the thinking layer of the population. <br>  Here are the basic rules that the author says: <br>  1. Do not listen to anyone. <br>  2. The idea does not have to be a big one, it just has to be yours. <br>  3. Allocate time to it. <br>  4. If your business plan is designed for the fact that you suddenly notice some kind of lump, then most likely you will not work. <br>  5. You are responsible for the result. <br>  6. Everyone was born creative, everyone was given a box with pencils in kindergarten. <br>  7. Do not quit the main job. <br>  8. Suppressing creative companies can not compete with companies that encourage it. <br>  9. Everyone has his own personal Everest, for which he came to this earth to climb. <br>  10. The talented person, the less support he needs. <br>  11. Do not try to stand out from the crowd - avoid it. <br>  12. Accepted pain does not bring suffering. <br>  13. Never compare your inner with anyone else's external. <br>  14. The joy of dying young is somewhat exaggerated. <br>  15. The most important thing that a creative person can professionally learn is where to draw the line that separates what you are willing to do from what you will never do. <br>  16. The world is changing. <br>  17. Recognition can be bought.  Feeling is impossible. <br>  18. Avoid gossips. <br>  19. Sing in your voice. <br>  20. The choice of media means does not matter. <br>  21. Sell harder than it looks. <br>  22. Nobody cares.  Do it for yourself. <br>  23. Experiencing because of the problem ‚ÄúEarnings or art‚Äù is a waste of time. <br>  24. Do not worry about inspiration.  It will come by itself. <br>  25. You must find your own chips. <br>  26. Write with the soul. <br>  27. The best way to get approval is to not need it. <br>  28. Power is never given, power is taken. <br>  29. Whatever you choose, sooner or later the devil will take. <br>  30. The most difficult thing in creativity is getting used to it. <br>  31. Stay humble. <br>  32. Let your labor ripen with you. <br>  33. Being Poor - Sucks. <br>  34. Be wary of turning a hobby into a job. <br>  35. Enjoy the unknown while it is there. <br>  36. Start a blog. <br><br>  The whole book can be read here The <a href="http://translated.by/you/how-to-be-creative/">Russian version of the book</a> thanks to the guys from <a href="http://translated.by/">translated.by</a> , whose startup was covered in Habr√© about 2 months ago.  But in general, and all - enjoy reading! <br><br>  36. Start a blog!  :) </div>
