Most often, some complex, highly specialized, professional programs are cited.  I don‚Äôt know how true this opinion is, but some of the above categories seem to be crossed out. <br><br>  In one of the reports of the recently held CNews Forum, I saw the ‚ÄúDBMS for enterprises‚Äù in the software list, which will remain proprietary all and forever.  I cannot agree with this thesis, so I wrote a short article. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Is there an alternative to the giants of the database market? </h4>

      Today, free software occupies an important place in almost all areas of IT, but there are still areas in which proprietary products "dominate".  One of such areas is corporate DBMS.  This market segment is almost completely controlled by three giants: IBM, Microsoft and Oracle.  But is there really no alternative to proprietary databases in enterprises? <br><br>  At the end of October, Bruce Momjian, the leader of the PostgreSQL community and the database architect of EnterpriseDB, visited Moscow.  Bruce has been involved in database and related development for over 20 years.  Since 1996, he has been working with PostgreSQL, and in 2000 his book ‚ÄúPostgreSQL: Introduction and Concepts‚Äù was published.  We discussed with Bruce the prospects of open database management systems and, in particular, PostgreSQL in the Russian corporate market. <br><br>  Since 2004, the tendency towards the use of open products has become noticeable in the global market for corporate database management systems.  According to Forrester Research, by 2008, <a href="http://www.cnews.ru/reviews/free/software2005/articles/database.shtml">30% of enterprises were to use the Open Source database system to some extent</a> .  By 2008, this trend has reached our country.  According to Gartner, two years ago, the use of open source DBMS in Russia increased 2.5 times (from 25% to 63%), which made it possible to say that database management systems (DBMS) are <a href="http://www.cnews.ru/news/top/index.shtml%3F2008/10/15/323055">the fastest growing type of free software</a> in Russia. <br><br>  But what about the open DBMS in Russia now?  According to Bruce, there is a significant increase in the number of corporate use of open DBMSs, but it is difficult to track and evaluate.  And according to such characteristics as the possibility of expanding the functionality and refinement for integration with third-party software, open DBMS, in fact, have no analogues.  In particular, PostgreSQL is used in a large number of niche and specialized solutions.  Many companies have their own (or custom-made) development, the use of which open products, thanks to the free and low cost support, is very profitable. <br><br>  Another direction of potential influx of potential users is migration from proprietary DBMS to open ones.  According to Forrester, 85% of corporate clients use less than 30% of the entire functionality of corporate DBMS.  If you look at the <a href="http://www.tadviser.ru/index.php/%25D0%25A1%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%258C%25D1%258F:%25D0%25A1%25D0%25A3%25D0%2591%25D0%2594_%2528%25D1%2580%25D1%258B%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA_%25D0%25A0%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8%2529">Russian database market</a> , it will be distributed as follows: Oracle - 69.9%, MS SQL - 8.5%, IBM DB2 - 7.2%.  These three IT corporations account for almost 90% of the DBMS shipments.  But today there are solutions for almost automatic migration from Oracle to <a href="http://www.enterprisedb.com/products/postgres_plus_as/overview.do">EnterpriseDB Postgres Plus Advanced Server</a> , thanks to the high compatibility between them.  There is also a fairly well-known Russian project <a href="http://etersoft.ru/content/view/154/208/">SELTA @ etersoft</a> , which allows PostgreSQL to be used in applications developed for MS SQL. <br><br>  Thus, due to migration from Oracle and MS SQL, about 80% of the DBMS market can switch to PostgreSQL-based solutions relatively painlessly.  And although Etersoft and EnterpriseDB products are not free, they can significantly reduce the total cost of ownership of the system by reducing the cost of license fees.  And in the case of developing a custom solution, the use of PostgreSQL, as a functional and simultaneously accessible database, is almost indispensable. <br><br>  So is there an alternative to DBMS such as Oracle and MS SQL?  Bruce Momzhan answers unequivocally: ‚ÄúYes, of course.  After all, it is the EnterpriseDB company in which I work that has long and successfully helped many of its customers use PostgreSQL in large, industrial systems. ‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/108860/">https://habr.com/ru/post/108860/</a></p>
