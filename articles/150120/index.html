  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to conduct business in the dark light of a crisis of confidence?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  People react funny to offers on the Internet: they often believe what they believe is stupid and even dangerous, and they do not believe what there is no obvious reason not to trust.  The following text is not the result of a study of this phenomenon, but rather a generalization of experience in the hope of expanding it in the comments. <br><br>  Trust is a big shortage in the modern world, I am sure that you will agree that its acquisition and preservation is important both in IT and in business in general, <s>and in winning the desired heart</s> . <br><br>  Have you ever met with mistrust and illogical - it would seem - refusals from customers?  To me - yes, and below I will tell why they arise, and how I try to fight it.  It will be great if you tell in the comments about your methods of struggle.  Let me emphasize that now we are talking about offering the services that the client really needs, and if you can deal with objections by selling MMM coupons, your experience is not entirely applicable (although in life it may be twice as useful).

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Unreasonable trust </h2><br>  Everyone knows about the danger of clicks on links supposedly sent by friends: since the invention of e-mail, there have been no problems with faking a return address.  In any social network (see <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/150120/">note</a> ) there were, there are, and inevitably there are new loopholes that allow, on behalf of your friend, to send you a dubious offer.  And even experienced IT specialists sometimes fall for the skill of social engineering, crafty enticing passwords or other personal data. <br><br>  Hacking of popular services on the Web and publishing thousands of passwords (or their checksums, which usually allow you to calculate the passwords themselves), add fuel to the fire.  In Russia, the last noticeable theft of personal data that I remember concerned the online payment operator Chronopay (details are described in the discussion on <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/110996/">Habr√©</a> , on <a href="http://xakepy.cc/showthread.php%3Ft%3D65037">xakepy.cc</a> and even on <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChronoPay">Wikipedia</a> ), and in the world there is a relatively recent theft of LinkedIn password hashes ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/145345/">on Habr√©</a> , a <a href="http://semonix.ru/samye-populyarnye-paroli/">review of the theft from LinkedIn versus</a> a similar case in 2010). <br><br>  Despite the very real danger of theft of personal data, and then money, hundreds of millions of people continue to trust their data and money to companies doing business on the Internet. <br><br>  I myself am one of them and I think that the main motive of such carelessness is the <b>convenience of online services, the lack of user awareness</b> and the <b>relatively low probability of a serious loss</b> .  To the ignorance, I first of all attribute the hope that in case of real data theft through the Network and withdrawing money from a credit card, the bank will be on the client‚Äôs side.  In fact, the bank is far from always (and rarely, willingly and quickly) ready to return money stolen via the Internet. <br><br><h2>  Sad distrust </h2><br><br>  On the other hand, in recent days I have talked with several potential customers of data backup services.  The offer I was talking about with them is interesting mainly by a convenient client program, because the very possibility of backing up to a server or to the cloud is not currently offered only by a very lazy data center or provider (just yesterday, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/149942/">a fresh service Glacier from Amazon was announced</a> ). <br><br>  Of course, in our program, backup copies are packed into a password-protected archive, and then encrypted with 256-bit AES <b>before</b> being transferred to the repository.  The transfer itself can be done via SSH, it is possible - also via VPN, data can be transferred in parts of different sizes, so I have no technically sound fear of their kidnapping.  Correct me if you think that some other protective measures are required. <br><br>  However, the essence of the service - storing your data on other servers - with top managers and owners of companies causes a frank mistrust.  There is cautious trust only among professional IT specialists who object otherwise: ‚Äúwhy should I pay 3000 rubles a month to keep my backup with you, if I can buy a terabyte disk for this money and keep it in my closet?‚Äù (For that too There is something to argue, but this has nothing to do with trust). <br><br>  Moreover, for non-IT people, the phrase ‚Äúyour data is encrypted with 256-bit AES before transfer‚Äù sounds like ‚Äú <b>data is boo-boo-bu encrypted bu-bu-bu</b> ‚Äù.  Therefore, technical details are a weak argument, even if the backup system is perfectly protected. <br><br>  Mistrust is not a service in the process of execution, not a service after it is performed, not the process itself, not the personalities of the performers.  <b>Distrust causes a service as such</b> - the idea to entrust something of your own to someone not your own.  This is quite unexpected for people who are used to giving their credit card to a waiter to pay a bill (which is not accepted, for example, in France), children - nurse and kindergarten, car - to unknown craftsmen at a car service, etc. <br><br><h2>  How to gain trust? </h2><br><br>  The answer is trivial: sell only to people who already trust you at face-to-face meetings.  As a matter of fact, I have only two recipes - the offer of services to old acquaintances and the offer of services to old acquaintances of clients. <br><br>  Those people who have known us for many years and with whom we have many common acquaintances trust us, because the probability that we want to lose reputation and break with our childhood friends in exchange for a few thousand rubles of profit is very low. <br><br>  The second recipe is offering services to friends of existing customers.  They can confirm that we are honest people, and even share their own experience of using the service. <br><br>  Everything else - reviews [ <i>for third-party people - no one knows</i> ] on the site, a beautiful booklet with a story about ‚Äúdata bu-bu-bu encrypted bu-bu-bu‚Äù, backup advertising in social networks and even first place in Yandex search results - they will not convince managers that it is safer to keep backups in the data center than on the shelf in their office. <br><br>  Even a well-known name and a generally positive image do not guarantee the required level of trust: it is enough to search for H√©br√®s topics about Selectel, Oversan or Amazon. <br><br>  Because of this, the expansion of trust is possible only through personal communication, and therefore it happens at the speed of meeting people at meetings, conferences and holidays. <br><br><h2>  An interesting note at last </h2><br>  Before publishing the article I talked with my friends from Irkutsk.  They believe that the security of data storage in the data center is occupied more by people in Moscow and St. Petersburg, and in smaller cities this concerns (at least for now) a smaller percentage of managers. <br><br>  What is your experience? <br><br><a name="footnote1"></a>  * social networks may not be to blame at all, however keyloggers, trojans and other types of bad software can still help send a malicious message on behalf of a compromised user. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/150120/">https://habr.com/ru/post/150120/</a></p>
