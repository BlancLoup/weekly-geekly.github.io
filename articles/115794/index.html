  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Little under-game under-development story</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Immediately a reservation, so as not to waste precious time dear habrovchan: in this post there will be no words either about Unity3D, nor about HTML5, nor about any other modern interesting things.  It will be about the fact that game developers are gradually forgotten when they create something unimaginably beautiful.  But which, alas, is absolutely uninteresting to play.  Unless to admire effects yes to check on performance. <br><br>  You can accuse me of retrograde - but I absolutely do not digest modern games.  A couple of times a year I can drive in NFS, but nevertheless modern NFS is no longer the same (but the graphics are impressive, yes) :-( But in NES-toys I often get paid, although you yourself know what graphics are there. In games, graphics are not important and not the steepness of the technology used. In games, playability is important. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Back in my childhood, when my parents gave me a prefix Famicom clone, and it was stressful with cartridges, I was stuck with a Road Fighter toy.  Although there were only four "floors", he played day and night.  Very lacked the ability to zandarod rocket at the enemy.  Later such an opportunity appeared in the Spy Hunter toy, but there was too much shooting there.  And I just wanted to go on the road on a typewriter and occasionally shoot ... <br><br>  I myself have never tried to make games, not mine.  But the other day it took for my <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/DIY/108058/">controlled camera</a> to make normal control of the keyboard keys.  Previously keystrokes were processed by JS, but there were glitches, I wanted to fix it.  The first thing that comes to mind is Flash.  I have never seen Flash-development in my eyes, but then there was a need to create a simple control panel.  On the first evening of tinkering with ActionScript 2.0, a swf file appeared that met my needs.  And then I came across <a href="http://xitri.com/">xitri.com</a> blog.  Where in one of the records I saw a flash drive and an example of a machine control algorithm.  I tried to implement it myself - it turned out subjectively quite well.  Immediately I thought to visualize the control of the Q-steer machine, of which I have been a fan for some time :-) the machine was quickly photographed, added to the project and started driving around the screen.  It was Happiness - to sit and drive on a typewriter on a white field.  But something was missing, some background.  And he climbed to his blog to write some kind of note and saw the Google Map ...

      The result - the machine rides on Google Map.  Elementary scripts, elementary management, but delays.  And not only me, many acquaintances, who gave potest responded enthusiastically.  Maman, in general, traveled the entire route from her house (Tula) to us (me and my family in Moscow).  And earlier, when she came to visit us by car, she was wandering almost all the time, after all, after Tula, driving around Moscow is rather complicated.  And then she really saw the route from the side and virtually ‚Äúdrove‚Äù it :-) <br><br> <a href="http://www.mikrogonki.ru/qsteerdrive/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/ae/d5/aed5804a7f641ddd2f835adffabcb6dc.jpg"></a> <br><br>  In short, I don‚Äôt know if this craft can be called a toy, but people like to drive around the map.  Some immediately asked to add a BFG-9000 to the machine, so that it was possible to smash everything around :-) Well, add a multiplayer ... I can hardly draw it myself, so I give the idea :-) <br><br>  PS My two-year-old daughter has three boxes of toys.  But she abandoned them for a long time and can play for hours with ordinary potatoes.  Apparently, toy manufacturers also have problems with the playability of their products :-) <br><br>  PS Yes, one more bydlofleshkoder became more ... <br>  PPS From the hall suggest - already there was <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/Flash_Platform/34053/">something similar</a> . <br>  PPS Ride can <a href="http://www.mikrogonki.ru/qsteerdrive/">be here</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/115794/">https://habr.com/ru/post/115794/</a></p>
