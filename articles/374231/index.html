That's because the game turned out to be like two peas in a pod like the undisputed favorite of the time - Super Mario Bros. <br><br>  According to one version, the creators tried to make Mario available on more platforms than Nintendo allowed. (Indeed, only owners of Nintendo consoles could play in Super Mario Bros.) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rg/af/g4/rgafg4o--etlweq-kxayxgklme4.jpeg"><br><br>  According to another version, the calculation of the developers was simple: as soon as possible to cut the dough on everything already ready.  But how to do it, if all the lick a carbon copy?  ‚ÄúAnd let's replace the male gender of the hero with the female.  Well, slightly redraw the enemies.  And instead of brother (Luigi with Mario) we will have sisters! ‚Äù <br><br>  As a result of differences from Mario - virtually none. <br><br><h2>  Similarities and differences </h2><br>  See for yourself.  The same stone path, the same broken bricks and golden blocks with coins.  The same mushrooms, the same secret brick blocks, rivals dogs and turtles, also killed by jumping from above. <br><br>  The same dungeons, except that the enemies, though redrawn, but with the same behavior.  The levels, albeit slightly different, are minimal in design. <br><br>  Instead of predatory flowers on the pipes - the fire.  The dragon is also found in the dungeon, only in this version it looks more like a tipsy flying crocodile. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vv/ax/px/vvaxpxodeb_byshpsc8jkr_2mps.jpeg"><br><br>  Well, what I liked here more than in Mario is the musical arrangement, here it is much more interesting. <br><br><h2>  Musical accompaniment </h2><br>  Here it is, the same melody: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p1F6_kSFAMY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Here I brought a more melodic cover version, written in the same Chiptune format by composer Cyborg Jeff. <br><br>  And here is the original: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ne-09Bs_bRo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Machinae Supremacy cover version: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XKkmyMKbPKE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h2>  A bit of the history of the game </h2><br>  Initially, the company released its creation on the Commodore 64, and soon games were released on the Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST and MSX2.  Version for the ZX Spectrum did not have time to get out of the claims of Nintendo.  A later, Great Giana Sisters ported, unofficially, on Windows, DOS, Linux, Mac OS X, AmigaOS 4, NetBSD, AROS, MorphOS, Symbian OS and, in 2009, on Nintendo DS. <br><br>  You can watch the game in action in this video: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lbE74aMIypk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h2>  What was the result? </h2><br>  Since the game was withdrawn from sale immediately after release, rumors spread that Nintendo - the creator of the real Mario - decided to sue the plagiarist.  Nintendo, indeed, by all means contributed to the seizure, but, nevertheless, there were no litigation.  Well, in those copies of the game, which had time to leak into the sale, quickly became the property of collectors and, as usual, began to cost a lot of money. <br><br>  Whatever it was, but the result of the creation of the Great Giana Sisters, in addition to several sequels - Giana Sisters DS, Giana Sisters 2D, Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams and Giana Sisters: Dream Runners - was one of the most memorable and popular soundtracks ever created for computer games.  A bunch of cover versions are written on it, including the performance of a real orchestra, and which every self-respecting collector of Chiptune has melodies. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/374231/">https://habr.com/ru/post/374231/</a></p>
