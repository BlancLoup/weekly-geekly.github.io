  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Online store fast</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img align="right" src="http://www.e-pepper.ru/cart/shoptus-logo.png" alt="image">  I want to introduce you to an interesting service for creating online stores - <a href="http://www.shoptus.ru/">Shoptus</a> .  I myself have recently used it in developing a small "selling" site and now I am sharing with you who can come in handy.  The authors write that their project is ‚Äúthe easiest and fastest way to open your online store!  ".  That's what bribed me, because  deadlines were running out. <br><br>  Shoptus is one of the examples of the new wave of SaaS projects in Russia.  If suddenly someone else is not in the subject, then this is when the software does not need to be bought along with the license and the subsequent implementation, but you can just rent it.  In this case, all the technical part is located on the side of the owners of the service, as well as responsibility for the performance and development.  What does this mean for end users?  No need to pay immediately and much, no need to think about implementation and support.  You can simply use and pay quite adequate monthly fee.  The advantages of the approach are obvious, which is why we can observe a slow but sure migration of everything and everyone in SaaS. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, go to the project site, in the center of the big red button "Open your store" - click.  Registration form: fill in the e-mail, invent a domain for the store and password, register.  No checks and confirmations in the mail, we immediately get to the store's control panel.  From the welcome message it follows that the store has already been created and is ready to go.  We follow this link, it really works - 1 ‚Äúfish‚Äù product, you can see, add to cart and buy.  The order immediately appears in the control panel. <br><br>  This, of course, is not yet ready to shop, because  all the same, there are no exactly my goods, descriptions for them and other content, but the basis is ready.  Next thing for the owner of the store.  Indeed, it is not possible to open a store faster.  But then the question arises, what kind of store is it, and here everything is not so clear.

      Their main feature is the ability to add such a store directly to your website in the body of any page (similar to inserting a youtube video or card, you just need to insert a piece of HTML code).  This is probably the main purpose. Separate use of the store with a separate domain is also provided, but it looks quite simple (the store block itself, you can only ‚Äúdecorate‚Äù with the background, like tweeter, and insert a banner). <br><br>  Undoubtedly, such stores cannot be considered a professional solution, but I would call it ideal for beginner store owners or for those who need to be quickly and simply.  To start does not require any money or special knowledge or time.  And at the same time, the main functions of the ‚Äúadult‚Äù store in the system have already been laid down and it remains only to turn them on.  I will especially note: <br>  ÔÄ≠ <ul><li>  the ability to automatically publish store goods in Yandex.Market </li><li>  connection of the Robokassa payment system, which means there will be plastic in your store and all the other ‚Äúnecessary‚Äù currencies </li><li>  automatic calculation of the cost of delivery to other regions via EMS Russian Post </li></ul><br>  In general, if you are only thinking about opening a store, this is a good option to start with minimal investments or without them at all.  Of the bonuses - the domain as a gift and, as it turned out, the affiliate program, although it is not written about it normally. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/133885/">https://habr.com/ru/post/133885/</a></p>
