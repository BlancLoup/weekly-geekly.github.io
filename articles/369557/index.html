They set an absolute record for Indiegogo, collecting pre-orders for $ 2,446,824. <br><br>  That was the reason.  The first in the history of "smart" motorcycle helmet struck not only futuristic design, but also amazing <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/233067/">technical capabilities</a> : the helmet is equipped with a transparent full-face display with a convenient location in front of the eye, a wide-angle rear-view camera and a GPS-navigator.  He shows the way along the route and everything that is going on behind his back. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Aerodynamic helmet connects to the Internet via a mobile phone via Bluetooth, receives software updates in automatic mode.  It is also equipped with a safe visor that does not sweat on fog and protects from sun glare.

Advanced features could potentially save thousands of lives. <br><br>  Unfortunately, the Skully AR-1 helmet remained only in the form of a few manufactured prototypes.  Before the mass production is not reached.  August 5, 2016, the company officially <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/skully-ar-1-the-world-s-smartest-motorcycle-helmet">announced the termination of activities</a> , and now is going to file for bankruptcy. <br><br>  The existence of problems in the company could be understood when the Skully governing board forced the founders, Marcus and Mitch Wellers, to leave.  When the founders are expelled from the company, this is not a good sign. <br><br>  Later, most of the employees left the company, including engineers from the development department. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6d4/a12/b9f/6d4a12b9fc014cbf85007f7b13a03344.jpg"><br><br>  According <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/06/skully-officially-admits-its-over/">to insiders</a> , the startup had to be closed for the usual reason: the money ran out.  Differences arose between the founders of the company and investors about how the founders spend money, as well as about some production problems. <br><br>  The closure of such a project is very sad, because quite a bit was not enough to implement the plans.  The company was very close to getting an additional investment of $ 6 million, but did not have time - corny did not have enough time. <br><br>  The initiation of a bankruptcy procedure means that users probably will not receive reimbursement of pre-orders for an augmented reality helmet valued at $ 1,500.  The company management apologizes. <br><br>  However, some compensation will still be available.  The manufacturer of motorcycle equipment, Fusar, acted humanely and <a href="https://www.fusar.com/blogs/news/an-open-letter-to-skullys-customers">offered the</a> victims the credit equivalent of the lost amount as part of the <a href="https://fusartech.leadpages.co/leadbox/14048ef73f72a2%253A15aaa0124746dc/5700305828184064/">Skully Owners Stimulus (SOS)</a> rescue program. <br><br>  However, something else pleases.  Sooner or later such a motorcycle helmet will surely be made.  Maybe another firm, but will. <br><br>  <i><b>UPD 08/09/2016</b> .</i>  <i>The lawsuit against the Wellers brothers was <a href="http://thenextweb.com/gadgets/2016/08/09/skully-kickstarter-lawsuit/">filed by</a> their former accountant Isabelle Faithauer.</i>  <i>She claims that she was forced to cover the founders' personal expenses at the company's expense, including renting an apartment, buying four motorcycles, a Dodge Viper car, visiting strip clubs, etc.</i>  <i>In this case, employers did not pay her overtime, thereby violating California law.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/369557/">https://habr.com/ru/post/369557/</a></p>
