It is clear that to <i>sit down, stand up</i> or <i>come up</i> already will not surprise anyone, but there are other interesting cases, and not only with phrasal verbs. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  Take the second left </blockquote>  This is not “take the second left”, as you would like to translate literally, but “take the second left” or “turn left at the second intersection”.

    <blockquote>  How do you do?  - All right! </blockquote>  Remember this classic?  "How are you doing?  “All right!” Of course, the meaning of the phrase is different.  In addition to “how are you”, <i>how do you</i> can even be an analogue of the word “hello”, and <i>all right is</i> better translated as “all is well” (your cap!). <br><br><blockquote>  Time is up </blockquote>  “Time is above,” right?  Although no, stop, this translates as “time is up” or “time is up”. <br><br><blockquote>  Help yourself </blockquote>  “Help yourself”, got it!  In fact, very close in meaning.  But the phrase more often means “help yourself” or “do not be shy, eat / take”. <br><br><blockquote>  Shame on you </blockquote>  Aah, take it away, take that shame away from me!  But the meaning can be understood almost immediately, because the translation here will be “shame on you”! <br><br><blockquote>  Give me a kiss </blockquote>  Give me that kiss!  Yes, here everything is clear and true, but the literal translation of the phrase sounds more fun than “kiss me”. <br><br><blockquote>  Over here </blockquote>  Here is the end!  Although stop, this is just a more conversational way to say “here” or “here.” <br><br><blockquote>  Make up your mind </blockquote>  Here we are not called to make a mind or intelligence.  And just ask to decide or decide on something. <br><br><blockquote>  Come up with new ideas </blockquote>  To whistle everyone up with new ideas, so one could translate literally.  Although it would be more accurate to say “prepare new ideas” or “offer new options”. <br><br><blockquote>  What are you up to? </blockquote>  This phrase is definitely not literally translated as “what are you up” or something like that.  Actually the translation sounds like “what are you doing?”. <br><br><h2>  Idioms </h2><br>  This is where the fun begins, because idioms were not originally intended for a literal translation.  And there are a lot of them in the English language and everyday life. <br><br><blockquote>  As cool as a cucumber </blockquote>  "Cool as a cucumber", or what?  In fact, it’s just “cool and calm,” or “equanimity itself.” <br><br><blockquote>  Kick the bucket </blockquote>  This is not “kick the bucket”, but “die.”  That's so sad, yes.  But English is full of euphemisms (such words or phrases to more delicately describe the themes of life and death, religion and many other sensitive issues). <br><br><blockquote>  Let's get hammered </blockquote>  “Let's get drunk”, such is the correct translation.  And literally it would have sounded like “let us walk with a hammer”. <br><br><blockquote>  Bob's your uncle </blockquote>  Do not rush to translate as “Tambov Bob uncle to you”.  The phrase actually means “the deed is in the hat,” or “the deed is done,” or “voila, and done.” <br><br><blockquote>  All talk and no trousers </blockquote>  You talk and talk, but no pants!  In principle, the literal translation can understand the meaning - “one talk” or “empty windshield”. <br><br><blockquote>  This party is on fire! </blockquote>  This party is on fire!  But do not rush and something to extinguish.  On the contrary, you can join the get-together, because really the value will be "at this party cool ignite." <br><br><blockquote>  Cut the mustard </blockquote>  It literally sounds like “cut mustard”.  Even the British are against such brutal translations, so the real meaning of the phrase is “to live up to hope”. <br><br><blockquote>  Heart in your mouth </blockquote>  The phrase does not mean another horror scene (the heart in the mouth), but only shows that the person is “scared to death”. <br><br><blockquote>  Hairy at the heel </blockquote>  Literally means “hairy heel”.  But the figurative meaning of the phrase sounds like “ill-mannered” or “rude”. <br><br><blockquote>  Cat got your tongue </blockquote>  Calmly, no cat is going to "grab your tongue."  Figuratively speaking, this is something like “what are you, language swallowed?”. <br><br><blockquote>  More holes than a Swiss cheese </blockquote>  "More holes than Swiss cheese."  In a sense, "more problems than good." <br><br><blockquote>  You are the apple of my eye! </blockquote>  "Yes, you're just my eyeball," I want to translate literally.  But the meaning of the phrase is completely different - “you are the light of my eyes” or “you are very dear to me (a)”. <br><br><blockquote>  I've got my eye on you! </blockquote>  Straight Silent Hill some!  Seriously, it simply means that you are being closely watched (we are not reduced to our eyes). <br><br><blockquote>  I've got my father's eyes </blockquote>  Says the protagonist of the old comedy “Hotheads” and literally gets them out of a beautiful little case.  The joke here is that this phrase means “my eyes are very similar to the eyes of my father”, and not to carry them with me all the time. <br><br><blockquote>  Cry me a river </blockquote>  Timberlake diligently sang.  And this was not his request, he just gloated a little over the girl who missed her happiness and left Justin.  So he could not resist, and said to her with sarcasm, "now crying." <br><br><blockquote>  You stole my thunder </blockquote>  Stop stealing my thunder!  Although stop, the real meaning is different - “seize the initiative.” <br><br><h2>  Militarism </h2><br>  Did you know that in the English language, especially the American version, militarisms often sound?  So historically, the sailors and the military had a strong influence on the language. <br><br><blockquote>  We start at nine hundred hours </blockquote>  It seems like time has been said, but what is nine hundred hours?  It's just such a way to say “exactly at 9” (time 9.00 looks like the figure 900). <br><br><blockquote>  Do you read me? </blockquote>  It is not about reading someone in social networks.  This is just an analogue of our “How do you hear me?” Or “reception”. <br><br><blockquote>  Do you copy? </blockquote>  Copy it there, probably?  Joke.  Before us is another way to say “welcome”. <br><br><blockquote>  Roger that </blockquote>  Roger is (and who else).  The real translation sounds like “accepted” or “understood you.”  By the way, you can just say “Roger”. <br><br><blockquote>  Stand by </blockquote>  Don't just stand by.  It means to be ready. <br><br><blockquote>  Stand down </blockquote>  Well, how can you stand down?  Therefore, the meaning is different - “to retreat” or “not to interfere”, or even “to cancel the combat readiness”. <br><br><blockquote>  WiLCo </blockquote>  You say that this is not a phrase at all, but some name.  Although it means “will comply” - our analogue “will be done”. <br><br><blockquote>  Fire in the hole </blockquote>  The fire in the hole or a hole in the fire, so I want to translate literally.  The real meaning of the phrase is not too far from such a translation: “be careful, a grenade” or “is now jerking.” <br><br><blockquote>  Enemy spotted </blockquote>  Watch out, there is a rash on the body over the enemy!  Or an allergy.  But the word “spot” still has the meaning of “notice”, which is used here - “the enemy is seen.” <br><br><blockquote>  Mayday </blockquote>  Not just "May Day".  Most often this is a SOS situation, especially if you repeat the phrase a couple of times - it will be immediately clear that you are asking for help. <br><br>  <i>We hope that this selection will cheer you up a bit and help you add bright colors to your English speech.</i>  <i>And what phrases did you come across?</i>  <i>Let's expand this list!</i> <br><br><h2>  Reader Bonuses </h2><br> <a href="https://www.englishdom.com/prices/xabra3/%3Futm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_source%3Dhabra%26utm_campaign%3Dphrases061217"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/e9/tf/yz/e9tfyzko4el0o2eyab8drkgqeim.png"></a> <br><br>  We give free access to three months of learning English through our online courses.
