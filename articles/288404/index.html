At the same time, the volume of content and services markets amounted to 563 billion rubles, and that of the electronic payments market - 268.7 billion rubles, which in total amounts to approximately 1.3% of Russia's GDP for 2012.  That exceeds turns of the same Gazprom and other miners.  This is a key moment that can change the entire political situation in Russia.  And these are only official figures, the shadow Internet economy is likely to be several times higher in terms of turnover. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  To begin with, let us ask ourselves a question: why would all businessmen, IT professionals and freelancers (to simplify this social and economic group, I will call it ‚ÄúIT community‚Äù) not create their own state?  After all, the special services in the spike with the oil and gas sector at one time it happened.

      In order to answer this question, it is necessary to look at what the government in today's Russia has done and is doing (I will name it to simplify the ‚Äúspecial forces-oil and gas elite‚Äù), and what it should have done, as well as its relationship with the ‚ÄúIT community‚Äù. <br><br>  Consider what functions the state should perform. <br><br>  The state should have a good financial system.  During their rule, the special forces oil and gas elite fully linked the ruble to the export of raw materials in dollars and euros.  Those.  made currency secured by raw materials and dependent on foreign currencies.  The bottom line: constant inflation, devaluations, and threats of default. <br><br>  Whichever system could create an IT community: there are many options, from decentralized e-currency, such as Bitcoin, to a cashless system like CyberSin.  In any case, it would be a smart money "smart money" and a smart system.  The money would be provided with products and services of the IT community, i.e.  high value-added goods, which would make the currency firm and attractive for settlements with foreign agents.  For example, programming for foreign customers would be paid for with our smart-money currency.  In view of the constant growth of the IT market around the world, the currency would become reliable.  And because the issue of currency would be automatic and provided by a particular product or service, inflation would fluctuate around zero. <br><br>  Many important for the state is the system of production of material goods.  Spetschin-neftegaz elite during his reign in Russia, most of the production, especially high-tech production - eliminated.  And the rest of the plants were preserved in their technological backwardness, paying subsidies to backward production in exchange for loyalty to it.  As a result, everything that is produced in Russia, is produced contrary to the system or with a labor productivity that is colossally low for the 21st century, so most of the material goods are brought from China, the EU and the USA. <br><br>  But what will the IT community do when it comes to power?  Representatives of the IT-community only because of the specifics of their work always strive to automate and robotize any processes, both online and offline.  Therefore, the IT-community would begin to set up robotic production and automate the existing ones.  It also developed an active additive industry (i.e., 3D printing).  This will lead to the export of surplus material production. <br><br>  The state should provide good education and medicine for its citizens.  What did the special forces oil and gas elite do in this direction?  By virtue of its low redistribution of nature, spetschin-oil and gas elite do not need smart citizens and their large numbers.  Therefore, the state built by them does everything so that from year to year education and medicine would get worse.  The main slogan for education in the current ministry is to create a highly qualified consumer.  The result - life expectancy in the country on average has fallen sharply compared with the USSR.  Educational peels of Russian universities are not valued by anyone not only abroad (they need to be confirmed, unlike USSR diplomas), but also in the country itself. <br><br>  The IT community‚Äôs view on education is the most progressive.  The Internet is full of useful free high quality courses, not only in programming, but also for other professions.  A lot of webinars, a lot of trainings held on business, psychology, personal life, etc.  via internet and offline meetings.  The IT community could develop a program of education throughout the country, including the most advanced courses from a variety of knowledge, as well as combining offline and distance education.  Most of the representatives of the IT-community are very informed people, they try to monitor their health and diagnose diseases.  In addition, now there are diagnostic devices the size of a USB flash drive analyzing everything right down to the dna.  These flash drives transmit information via the Internet to the diagnostic center.  With a massive disease diagnosis policy, people will be healthier, they will lead a healthy lifestyle, seeing the diagnostic results every day, depending on their behavior.  A system of prevention and diagnosis with an information center could significantly reduce the cost of people for drugs and hospitals.  The result - in the country there would be more truly intelligent and educated people who would be able to get well settled and be full-fledged members of society at a lower cost for education itself from the IT state.  Medicine was more diagnostic and would have prevented the disease, which would make it much cheaper.  And if you brought your body to the disease, then go get better for money. <br><br>  One of the main functions of the state is the administrative function.  Officials elected by the people at the highest posts should direct the lower officials to fulfill the will of the people for the improvement of the village, city, district, region, in general, the administrative subject.  I will not talk about the "merits" of the special forces-oil and gas elite in this direction, they are visible to everyone.  Starting from the election and ending with utilities and roads.  Bureaucracy, instead of performing its functions, has become in its essence a parasitic subject, living through kickbacks and bribes.  In such a system, even the best intentions, descending from above, turn on the ground at best into deficiencies, at worst into simulacra. <br><br>  The IT community has methods for solving the problem of administering subjects.  First, these are open electronic elections to local councils, so that no one doubts that the chosen candidate truly reflects the will of the people.  Secondly, it is the development of self-government.  This is the creation of smart homes with zero power consumption, this is electric cars on good roads.  This is the decision of the tenants themselves to which company to apply for the execution of services of housing and communal services.  Thirdly, it is the automation of decision-making (a system like Kibersin), it is the automation of public services.  The introduction of these technologies allows you to send in dismissal and retirement up to 90% of officials, which will reduce the distance between selected officials and people, and at the same time reduce the level of corruption by orders of magnitude, thanks to transparency, popular control and reassignment of most of the decisions of the automated control system.  All this will reduce the cost of administration in the country by orders of magnitude. <br><br>  The state should have a strong army.  What happened to the army during the rule of the special forces oil and gas elite?  The army has become a gathering of antediluvian technology, which can not solve the tasks.  No, of course, several combat-ready units survived, as the strong genetics inherited from the SA affected, and local conflicts prevented these units from rotting along with the rest of the army.  Most of the army became an army of slaves with antediluvian technique, hazing and hiring for businessmen.  Yes, and advanced units can not boast of the wealth of modern weapons, which is still created by old men from Soviet design bureaus.  These weapons are primarily sold to Arab countries and Asia.  For the time being, only inherited nuclear forces are being saved and not yet outdated, not yet outdated air defense systems. <br><br>  How does the IT community relate to weapons?  The IT community understands the enormity of the situation and wants to have a strong army.  By nature, the IT community is driven by innovation, modern technology, robots and automation.  Therefore, it will create a strong air army of UAVs, robotic troops, unmanned boats and submarines, as well as robotic armored vehicles.  And all this will be managed through cyber centers.  The United States and Israel are the closest to this type of army. It was precisely the poet that the Ministry of Defense recently bought Israeli drones twelve years ago (nobody will sell newer technologies). <br><br>  Accordingly, the police are still needed for order in the state.  During the rule of the special forces oil and gas elite, a huge organized gangster-corrupt police system was created, the main task of which was to pick up extra money from citizens under any pretext, impudent behavior, expressed in shooting in public places at unsuspecting citizens, beatings of unsuspecting citizens, rude treatment of unsuspecting citizens, extortion from unsuspecting citizens, banditry and visits to businessmen.  And the performance of direct duties for this police system has become a kind of distraction in relation to the main type of activity.  Therefore, in such cases, if it is impossible to take a bribe from a criminal in any way, the crime is blamed on some previously prepared ‚Äúterpilu‚Äù. <br><br>  What kind of police system would the IT community build?  First, it would maximally use modern technologies on the one hand to identify criminals, from murders and thefts recorded on the camera to speeding registered on the camera, on the other hand for openness and fixing the actions of the police.  The IT community would create a system that reduces the human factor and simplifies the search for criminals.  Of course, no system would have been able to infiltrate the current police system.  Therefore, it would be necessary to send all current employees to leave for life with severance pay, and on the one hand, they should have recruited people who had no legal problems and, on the other hand, never served in bodies. <br><br>  One of the most important social components in the state is the pension system.  How is it implemented with the special forces oil and gas elite?  In general, it is implemented simply.  There is a certain state pension fund with planned losses and theft, which receives money from employers for their employees.  There are some state-sponsored retirement programs with appeals to invest in the funded part of the pension, which they allegedly double in 10 years, when inflation will triple.  There are direct appeals of the state to its citizens to invest in non-state pension funds in order to relieve themselves of responsibility for the burden of the funded part in conditions of terrible inflation.  In this case, you can not pay the funded part at all.  At the same time, it is also impossible to cash their savings ahead of time (even with fines it is impossible, there is simply no such possibility).  And there are pensioners who are satisfied with handouts from the oil and gas sector, because in the 90s there were none.  And therefore these pensioners regularly, directly or indirectly, vote for the elite special forces. <br><br>  What would the IT community do with the pension system?  It is clear that accumulating something with such a currency is meaningless, for this you need to create a different financial system (see above).  It is clear that it is necessary to eliminate the theft factor, and for this the system should be as automated as possible.  For example, when creating some smart money, you can sew a pension payment of a certain percentage from each transaction into the monetary system program, you can also collect fractions of a percent from transactions for other infrastructure and social projects of the IT state, instead of taxes.  Already now, given the turnovers of the IT community, you can have a budget comparable to the budget of the Russian Federation, only with smaller smart taxes from each transaction and a smart distribution system that eliminates the human factor in the form of an official.  With the growth of the economy, all social categories and infrastructure projects get more, with stagnation - proportionally less.  This is all automatically adjusted.  Monjo can also think of other systems, but I am sure that the IT community will be able to offer an automatic option that excludes the very existence of a corrupt element.  No intermediaries, only the grandmother's account, which is dripping money from the system in the machine. <br><br>  Interaction between the IT community and the special elite oil and gas industry <br><br>  Is cooperation possible between classes that are so different in their essence and goals (for whom it is more convenient for them to be called communities, groupings or systems)?  It is theoretically possible only if the elite of the special forces-oil and gas elite stumps the paths of their classes and takes the gradual replacement of the special forces-oil and gas elite with the IT community while maintaining their PERSONAL position (the position of more material and status-promoting, rather than real functions) in the new structure. <br><br>  What happens in practice?  On the one hand, we see certain gestures and even mimicry for the IT community of individual representatives of the special forces and the oil and gas elite.  On the other hand - one by one failures of this cooperation. <br><br>  I will give a few vivid examples. <br><br>  In the wake of protests against unfair elections, a wave of talk about e-democracy began.  In 2012, President Medvedev signed the law on political parties.  Under this law dozens of organizing committees of new parties fell.  Among them were the parties directly stating the primacy of the interests of the IT community.  After more than a year of stupid attempts to register on the lumps of the justice ministry, such parties as the Pirate Party of Russia, the Netcuratic Party of Russia, the Internet Party of Russia broke.  The first two have already received 3 official registration denials.  The third was not registered in the regions.  The history of failures can be found on the sites of these parties.  On the other hand, a bunch of fake parties of "their people" were registered.  Including immediately for sale.  It turned out that the IT-community with a huge weight in the economy did not have an official representation in the Duma, and even threw it beautifully. <br><br>  The second example: the numerous projects of the government on the introduction of high technologies in their decrepit state apparatus.  In this case, most of the money is sawn on the way to the performers.  And the IT people remain crumbs on which sometimes even the simulacrum is not done.  An example is poorly working public services (even though they all work the same way). <br><br>  The third example: subsidies to small businesses, start-ups and 3D printing centers.  Certainly with giant kickbacks and their own.  And the final recipients must report and clear up these kickbacks. <br><br>  Finally, it is an imitation of civil society and e-democracy.  In practice, the ROI proved the sham of the slogans under which it was created.  With the latest refusals to repeal anti-piracy law and other initiatives. <br><br>  What should the IT community do? <br><br>  Option three <br>  1) to assimilate in the Anglo-Saxon world, <br>  2) wait for your participation in the Russian Federation, <br>  3) create your own IT-state. <br><br>  We must understand that we are dealing not with the state power, but with a pseudo-state power, as can be seen from the results of the exercise of state functions by this power.  This spetschin-oil and gas elite is not in essence an object with which you can do business.  She respects only power and does not put anyone in anything.  Individuals included in this system, even with a strong desire, can change little, and even keep their word. <br><br>  For example, the tactic of abolishing anti-piracy law, chosen by the IT community, was losing in advance.  An effective method of dealing with a similar law by the IT community has <a href="http://vk.com/wall-25117353_77920">been demonstrated in the United States</a> .  There was a real informational and economic war.  It came to the informational casting of the congressmen themselves.  At the same time, there was the unanimity of the entire IT community, including such giants as Google. <br><br>  We must begin by building our own monetary system and self-government system.  And if we can provide payments to our old people from our monetary system, tomorrow they will go to vote on our electronic elections along with the youth.  This will be the first step to e-tips.  All this can be done in parallel.  In no case do not cooperate with the authorities, do not accept grants and subsidies from them, by such actions you strengthen them.  Act decentralized, but with a single purpose. <br><br>  The only thing, how much the elite in power, is a great experience and awareness of their interests, as well as reinforcement of the corrupt structure by cash flow from the sale of resources.  But their cash flow is less than the cash flow of the IT community, it is time to separate these flows.  The IT community lacks only awareness of their common interests.  And so it is possible to organize any complex system. <br><br>  Edinorosy used to like to say: "If not us, then who?", Maybe it's time to answer them? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288404/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288404/</a></p>
