This news was officially announced at the exhibition "Igromir-2014".  This will help Ubisoft to gain a foothold in the fast-growing Russian gaming market, and, as European director Alan Corre noted, ‚Äúthe Moscow office is a tribute to Russian players who are not indifferent, active and committed to their favorite games.‚Äù  The office of Ubisoft in Moscow will be headed by Olga Lazareva, who in the past was responsible for the development of Electronic Arts in Russia. <br><br>  Alan Corr said that the office in Moscow will be engaged in developing a strategy for development in the Russian market, as well as actively promoting games.  It is also planned to provide all products with high-quality information and technical support in Russian.  One of the first steps in this direction, according to Alan Korr, is the appearance of the official Russian channel Ubisoft on Youtube. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  Disney closes mobile projects for the sake of the Clash race </h4><br>  Recently it became <a href="http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Android/Star%2BWars%253A%2BTiny%2BDeath%2BStar/news.asp%3Fc%3D61859">known</a> that Disney removed from the free access to the App Store and Google Play two games about the Star Wars: Tiny Death Star and Star Wars Assault Team universe.  This step was taken shortly after the release of the next game about the Star Wars universe - the Star Wars Commander, we recall that this is a variation on the theme of Clash of Clans. <br><br>  Obviously, Disney decided to focus on the new project, given that its financial performance is much higher.  By removing these games, Disney got rid of ‚Äúunnecessary‚Äù support and slightly increases the flow of users to the game they need. <br><br>  Developer Tiny Death Star, the company Nimblebit reported that the decision to remove the game was for her a complete surprise, the company was not warned about such a course of Disney, while the developer clarified that the proceeds from the game accounted for a significant part of the company's cash receipts.  Tiny Death Star has been in stores for less than a year, and the Star Wars Assault Team was released in late March of this year. <br><br>  Disney has not officially commented on its decision, Nimblebit warned other developers that if they are looking for partnerships with Disney, then they should be very thoughtful. <br><br><br><h4>  Mobile hit Kim Kardashian: Hollywood is now on Facebook </h4><br>  If earlier (and even now often, we recall the King‚Äôs new products), the process was widespread when the game was launched and tested on social sites and then ported to mobile devices, now the mobile market is already so self-sufficient that we can see the reverse process.  Glu Mobile has officially announced the launch of its mobile hit Kim Kardashian: Hollywood on Facebook.  Having quickly flown into the top-grossing with the game and tested it, the company will distribute it to new markets.  It is possible that the first goal of the web was not accidental, since the animations in the game were created using Flash and then <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/221720/QA_Keeping_up_with_hit_mobile_game_Kim_Kardashian_Hollywood.php">transferred</a> to the game engine, which simplifies and speeds up the transition task. <br><br><br><h4>  The penetration of smartphones in Russia is growing, but using them less </h4><br>  According to a <a href="http://apptractor.ru/info/devices/proniknovenie-smartfonov-v-rossii-rastet-no-polzuyutsya-imi-menshe.html">study by Deloitte</a> , in 2014, smartphones significantly increased their popularity among Russians, penetration into the masses increased from 47% in 2013 to 66% in 2014, and smartphones finally surpassed ordinary phones in popularity. <br><br>  However, according to the results of the same study, the use of smartphone features became noticeably less. <br><br>  Thus, the share of respondents who have never downloaded applications on their phone has increased from 30% in 2013 to 41% in this. <br><br>  The share of those who spend more than 200 rubles on applications per month has decreased from 9% last year to 8% this year. <br><br>  Let's take a closer look at these numbers, and it will become clear that not everything is so bad.  In absolute numbers, the share of both downloads and payers undoubtedly increased, but not as fast as the popularity of smartphones themselves grows. <br><br>  We will not make premature conclusions, we will see what time will tell, although there is still the certainty that as you use more and more people will both download applications and pay in them. <br><br><br><h4>  New Google Analytics Features </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6ed/884/b3a/6ed884b3af464202be203f55893e4a4b.png"><br><br>  In Google Analytics for mobile applications, new useful features.  The mobile analytics version is rapidly catching up with the web version.  Audience Demographics Reporting - allows you to automatically segment your audience by a number of signs: age, gender, interests (by category).  Remarketing - allows using custom samples to segment the audience by the parameters that interest you, for example: application version, continent / country, user revenue, session length, etc.  According to the same templates, you can run ad campaigns in Google Adwords.  This is very similar to the Facebook advertising tool for returning users who have already used your application - Reengagement Advertisment.  These features greatly enhance the usefulness of Google Analytics.  The segmentation functions by sex, age, country are already considered to be a gentlemen‚Äôs set of any analytical service.  But the ability to give targeted advertising to a narrow segment of the audience can not only reduce advertising costs, but also increase its effectiveness, which is doubly pleasant. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/239795/">https://habr.com/ru/post/239795/</a></p>
