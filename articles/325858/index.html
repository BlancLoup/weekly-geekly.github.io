  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The world of payment mediation: a workshop in magic</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> As I promised in the previous article ‚ÄúIntroduction to the Magic World of Payment Intermediation‚Äù (link will be under the article), in the second part of the article I will look at ways to resolve the mediation market crisis and some features of sales of a complex information product.  It may be of interest not only to distributors / aggregators and banks, but also simply to sales professionals. <br><br>  So, we stopped on small changes of the decision maker in our scenario (I will consider one of the directions).  Initially, the manager was asked to go to SPIN using such questions: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ‚ÄúDo I truly understand that you are mainly engaged in <b>consulting and assistance in the preparation of documents</b> ?‚Äù <br><br>  "And you, at the same time, try to provide customers with a range of services in one window?" 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      ‚ÄúAnd how does the client pay for <b>duties and taxes</b> ?‚Äù <br><br>  We replaced them with these: <br><br>  ‚ÄúDo I truly understand that you are <b>processing</b> turnkey <b>migrants</b> ?‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúHow are your <b>patent</b> payments arranged?‚Äù <br><br>  Further, the script is followed by compressed SPIN-material, which was from the originally planned strength of one-third, precisely because further proceedings / objection handlers were no longer required.  Expect magic words?  And they are not.  We, too, were puzzled by the scale of the changes with such minor adjustments. <br><br>  Feedback was not what we expected from the experience of the first attempts at negotiations.  There were no questions on which objection handlers are configured: <br><br>  1. ‚ÄúWhy do we need to do this?‚Äù <br>  2. "How is the reception of payments organized?" <br>  3. "How much does all this cost?" <br><br>  If the question was, he was like this: ‚ÄúWill they pay?‚Äù  Will be.  This is a matter of technology.  At this stage, all our calculations and presentations, which we have prepared quite a few during our work, have already been involved. <br><br>  So what is the difference in our offer before and after the above changes?  At first glance, there is no difference at all.  If we carry out a content analysis of the formulations, it can be noted that a significant step has been taken towards concretizing the sentence, as well as changing the terminology.  But for what reason do these adjustments affect the result?  Next comes the construction of hypotheses and all sorts of transcendental socionics, so be prepared and critically perceive this information. <br><br>  The fact is that we, as experts in the field of processing and acceptance of payments, have a different conceptual apparatus from agents, as we work in another field.  For us, state fees, taxes, fines are, in essence, the same operations, with some private clauses, which for brevity can be called ‚Äúpayments in UFC‚Äù.  These operations have all the properties of ‚Äúpayments to the UFK‚Äù as a macro-object, and this macro-object is easily guessed to us when we fix the properties of its individual representations, such as ‚Äústate duty‚Äù or ‚Äúfine‚Äù.  Accordingly, initially we transferred ‚Äútaxes‚Äù, ‚Äúduties‚Äù, and ‚Äúfines‚Äù, thus wishing to form an association with a similar ‚Äúmacro payments‚Äù in the UFK head.  But they didn‚Äôt have it, because for them the indicated payments are not representatives of ‚Äúpayments to UFK‚Äù.  I can guess that there are other key entities for the decision maker, for example, ‚ÄúMandatory documents‚Äù, the presentation of which is the ‚Äúdocument on tax payment‚Äù.  Why is that?  Obviously, the human psyche is prone to abstraction, but it does so in order to form an image of reality and the processes taking place in it.  So they are important processes associated not with the processing of payments and their characteristics, but, say, the process of checking important documents for completeness, and therefore abstractions are different. <br><br>  Replacing the term ‚Äútax‚Äù with the term ‚Äúpatent‚Äù has a similar role.  Yes, a patent for the work of foreign citizens is a tax paid on an advance tax system.  And in our formulation there are no inaccuracies.  But for the decision maker is not so.  Let's dive into popular psychology even more strongly to suggest how a change in this term affects the processes taking place in the brain of DM. <br><br>  What is the purpose of the sales person when he handles the decision maker?  Arouse interest.  That is, to reserve the necessary resources in the psyche of the decision maker who will be ready to analyze the benefits of the proposed product / service / negotiation.  Whatever methods of sales, it is easy to see that their global goal is universal - to cause an indicative reflex.  Often it is proposed to do this through recognition.  All kinds of "tail" questions are directed at this, like: "You have encountered such situations, haven't you?"  Even if they did not come across, there is a good chance to cause an associative array with those questions that the decision maker actually encountered while he will process the specified one.  Why do you need it?  First, cause arousal of the cortex.  Secondly, if the decision maker is thinking about something in the background, reduce the influence of these thoughts as dominants on other thought processes or excite other dominants.  Thirdly, to undergo a critical ‚Äúfriend or foe‚Äù test, by demonstrating that the sales person lives in the same problematic reality as the decision maker.  By the way, the same goals are achieved by sending to familiar persons or recommendations from them. <br><br>  What happens if successful?  The decision maker awakens an orienting reflex, a readiness to receive new information and, possibly, closing old questions that have been postponed ‚Äúuntil then‚Äù.  He mobilized, speaking briefly.  How is this reaction achieved in theory?  Mass excitement of "necessary" areas of the cortex.  How to do it?  Refer to those cells that have the maximum number of synaptic connections.  Of course, related to professional information.  Recall how synaptic connections are formed?  With frequent electrical exchange of axons / dendrites.  If rude.  And, perhaps, the theorists who are more competent in this matter will be able to correct me, but in general, the mechanism is such that the theorists of mnemonics will not allow to lie. <br><br>  So, the manager needs to get into such conceptual constructions that will cause the most complete associative series and the longest possible non-breath of nervous excitement.  Our goal is concepts from the field of activity of decision makers with the maximum: <br><br>  1. Accuracy; <br>  2. Frequency of use; <br>  3. Emotional intensity. <br><br>  If we consider the change of just a few words in the scenario from the position of the above mechanisms, I think it becomes obvious why the effect was so noticeable.  Often used term that the decision maker hears daily - not a fee, not a tax, but a patent.  That's the whole ‚ÄúIt's magic!‚Äù <br><br>  The change in the question of the scope of the organization‚Äôs activity also works.  It is necessary to get exactly the term that the decision maker itself is replicating.  Yes, he prepares the documents, but he provides consultations, but he calls it differently.  He "makes out migrants."  And perhaps his ‚ÄúMake Migrants‚Äù macro-object will not tell us anything, just like our ‚ÄúPayments to UFK‚Äù macro-object, but we are striving to excite its bark, not ours.  So you need to communicate in his language. <br><br>  To summarize: the person who decides whether to join our project is mentally in another problematic reality, there is no national payment system and its representatives for him, he is not interested in how banks and operators with utility providers calculate each a friend.  In the business reality of such a partner, there are some typical questions that are mentioned by his cognitive processes, and the mention of our typical questions makes him bored and ‚ÄúGoodbye‚Äù.  In theory, the decision maker begins to elicit from you useful information for him and without our SPINs or FABs.  At this stage it is important to have this information freely. <br><br>  Consider a comment to my previous article, which refers to the text on our website about the inability of the Bank to be a paying agent: <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe, as a bank, connect to one of the payment aggregators, brought it to the cash desk, customer bank, ATMs are on the way, and where are we not right in legal terms?‚Äù <br><br>  A typical example of difference in terminology.  Consider it in the context of this article. <br><br>  Disclaimer: at the moment, payment services in the Russian Federation consist of many organizations.  Despite the fact that 103FZ gives an unambiguous terminology and methodology for organizing relations in payment services, it also sets the functions of the Operator for accepting payments (Payment Agent), in reality such services work so-so (read - ‚Äúthey aren‚Äôt‚Äù).  This is due to the mass of legislative restrictions and crutches, which can be managed only with the participation of other companies in the calculated interaction.  Moreover, the banks perform the same logical functions, but on the basis of a separate law and with separate terminology.  At the same time, the bank processes ‚Äútransfers without opening an account‚Äù, and the payment agent ‚Äúpayments‚Äù.  The operations are the same, but the punishment comprehends one who confuses them in business negotiations.  The fact is that the law prohibits banks from accepting cash payments directly.  But the translations - no.  But settlement centers can not be providers, whose services are paid for by ‚Äúpayments‚Äù, but the recipients, to whom ‚Äútransfers‚Äù are transferred, can.  These features interfere with the perception of commercial offers and business models, if the terminology is not adapted to the realities of decision makers. <br><br>  In this case, the commentator is a representative of the banking sector.  Drawing attention to the text indicated on the site, he considered it to be not accurate and, most likely, not professional.  Imagine if the same inaccuracy was made by the sales manager in the offer to the bank?  Renouncement. <br><br>  From such trifles, and formed the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe interlocutor as an expert.  Subject to the conceptual apparatus, with the most accurate proposal, the decision maker receives a signal that the interlocutor: <br><br>  1. Refers to his business community and has an understanding of realities and problems; <br>  2. Is a carrier of useful information that can be obtained immediately and free of charge; <br>  3. May possess means of influence on the questions that he himself cannot solve or the necessary connections. <br><br>  From the moment when the decision maker has a need for a conversation, the conversation can be planned in such a way as to fully present his proposal, since the ‚Äúmeeting‚Äù, as sales managers call this process, has taken place. <br><br>  But let's go back to mediation.  Having noted the first successes of our sales department, we voiced the results of this observation to our distribution partners.  Correcting his proposal accordingly, the distributor was also able to overcome the "dead center" in the process of actively attracting partners.  Moreover, the effectiveness of such attraction has exceeded our own many times, since we did not develop our sales department by that time, without seeing any noticeable progress. <br><br>  What it led to: a steady flow of connection requests was reoriented by our sales department almost completely to support this flow, and the functions of managers were transformed in such a way that they began to perform mainly technical support functions.  At the same time, the distributor is firmly established as our strategic partner, providing us with agents and recipients of payments. <br><br>  After such a specialization, we were able to pay attention to those aspects of our service, which were postponed "until better times."  The success of these relations allowed us to reorient the development strategy to stimulate mediators to work with our organization and virtually abandon the search for agents on their own. <br><br>  At the same time, it makes sense to regret the percentage held by the intermediary if the market is fully occupied and the growth of the sales network has slowed down.  Up to this point, the intermediary guarantees profit growth and an advantage in the expansion of the market over competitors.  Moreover, the expansion process supports itself. <br><br>  As I mentioned above, at the moment organizations - intermediaries in the banking and processing market are not easy to find, even if desired.  Usually they have the character of aggregators - satellites of large processing companies, such as banks.  Companies engaged in attracting agents in general is practically impossible to find.  According to my information, there are no more than three of them throughout Russia. <br><br>  What are the reasons for such freedom in the intermediary market?  In my opinion, confirmed by the company's experience, it‚Äôs all a matter of a fundamental approach error in organizing the sales department as such.  The inability of managers to reflect their expertise in the commercial proposal leads to inefficiency of such enterprises that specialize in intermediary services, since they receive profit only for the result of work.  In the meantime, there is a market need for such services.  Our experience shows that the profit growth of an organization that uses the services of a distributor is much higher, since the offer, which is mostly a software product, is not limited in quantity. <br><br>  In addition, intermediaries can afford to use different conceptual systems.  The bank attraction department speaks like a bank.  Agent connection department - communicates in the language of agents. <br><br>  If everything is clear with organizations, then how to deal with those enterprising individuals who are looking for themselves in the sphere of mediation services as individual entrepreneurs?  Paradoxically, it sounds, but I can see their niche even more clearly than the niche of specialized companies.  The economic crisis of 2013 led to the growth of unoccupied office workers who are trying to find themselves in many controversial areas, such as distant workers of one well-known Internet bank or even as representatives of MLM networks.  It is no secret that this activity does not bring significant profit, meanwhile representatives of this professional layer have all the skills to organize activities as intermediaries in the financial market, because they are distinguished by: <br><br>  1. Good communication skills; <br>  2. High stress tolerance; <br>  3. Involvement in large communities where information is rapidly spreading; <br>  4. Irregular working day. <br><br>  We can talk a lot about the intrusiveness of representatives of network marketing and cold "bell-ringers", offering to buy shares of the next "company with a positive quarterly report", but what should be given their due - usually they know how to keep the conversation going.  What will happen if the products they offer cease to be sugar-starch candies or multi-colored candy wrappers, and these individuals will begin to offer tools that are really in demand in certain areas of business?  Personally, I see this as a solution to many economic and social problems: some will get real employment according to their interests, others - partners, and third - means of additional income.  And yet, freelancers or entrepreneurs who act as intermediaries in the payments and processing market are also practically not observed. <br><br>  In addition to the marginality of this area for the sphere of economic relations of our country, I can relate this fact only to failures in this direction of work, which stop potential intermediaries.  It is possible that there is not enough feedback from the service consumer to analyze data failures. <br><br>  In this case, I am ready to provide this feedback on behalf of the operator to receive payments, bank payment agent and payment aggregator.  Let's start with the basics.  What I, as a decision maker of a company using the services of a distributor, would like to see as a service: <br><br>  1. Risk compensation.  The mediator is a mediator in order to compensate for the risks of counterparty partners at their own level.  The document flow must be protected from losses, counter-guarantees must be provided with a high reputation as an intermediary, and all issues between partners must be controlled by the intermediary until their successful resolution. <br><br>  2. Regular growth of the affiliate network.  The mediator must have compelling mechanisms to attract partners.  So that it‚Äôs banal not to go bankrupt and not to kill the developing network with exorbitant rates for its services. <br><br>  3. High expert level.  The mediator must understand the scope of the field in which his clients work, and not him.  He must quickly understand what the headache of the partner is about and take decisive steps to resolve such issues. <br><br>  4. Visual, understandable and persuasive materials.  Yes, an intermediary should be able to present information as textual and graphic materials and, if necessary, systematize the experience of partners, formalizing terminology and reducing all the variety of problems in its scope to standard ones. <br><br>  5. Extensive contact base.  Not superfluous, but even very useful will be the availability of the most complete base of contacts, useful in the chosen field of work.  And even better - a personal acquaintance with key figures. <br><br>  I understand that this list is quite massive and able to scare away many, but an intermediary in any market, not only in the finance market, has to sell only two products: information and reputation.  I will say a commonplace to smooth out frustration: first, the mediator works on these indicators, but then - on the contrary.  These indicators can and should be increased gradually. <br><br>  What is the direct subject of intermediary services?  This is always the compensation gap, mostly - terminological.     , ,     ,       .  ,   IT,        .  ,         ,            ,            . <br><br>       ,                     ,      : <br><br> 1.    .         ,       ¬´¬ª - .      . <br><br> 2. ,       ,    .    ,    ,   ,             . . <br><br> 3.     .  ,       ,       ; <br><br> 4.  .     ,     ,       . <br><br> 5.     . , ,  . <br><br> ,     ,    .          -,    . <br><br> ,            ,       ,     -,    . <br><br> ‚Üí <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/325696/">   </a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/325858/">https://habr.com/ru/post/325858/</a></p>
