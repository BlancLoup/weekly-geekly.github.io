  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Superbudget School Sound System</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Almost four months have passed since the date of publication of the ‚Äú <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/212591/">Experience of creating an interactive information system of the school</a> ‚Äù and so far the flow of letters with questions to me does not stop.  Many do or try to do something similar.  I understand that the topic of organization of IT infrastructure is quite in demand for school system administrators / enikeyshikov.  Well, if so, publish a description of the sound system of the school, maybe someone will come in handy. <br><br>  The main function of the system is to sound school events taking place in the school hall and on the territory in front of the school entrance with <u>minimal time costs</u> in accordance with the principle of ‚Äúcome-on‚Äù, without dragging the speakers and disentangling the wires. <br>  The idea itself was proposed by the head teacher for educational work in the fall of 2013, in December I sketched a project and bought equipment with ‚Äúwinter‚Äù money.  But the ‚Äúswitching‚Äù - cable / corrugated pipe / boxes / terminal blocks unexpectedly fell out of the purchase; I had to buy all this in May.  In May / June, the system is mounted, see what happened. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/15a/ff1/2f7/15aff12f7cf0385ac67756306d4f729d.png" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Based on the allocated budget (as much as 60 thousand rubles), the equipment of the Roxton line was chosen (only a respected UFO, do not ban me for mentioning this brand, I do not advertise, I just indicate the brand of specific equipment used). <br><br>  The central equipment (the music server, the old Compac NX6110 laptop and the AZ-560 power amplifier) ‚Äã‚Äãis installed in a rack with school servers.  Since the amplifier is solidly heavy, we had to withdraw the last power shelf under it.  Because of this setup, access to the terminals of the amplifier on the rear panel was very inconvenient, so we had to install an intermediate terminal box. <br><br>  Here is a photo of the audio equipment in the rack: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b51/877/bca/b51877bca0f03ea8f5357b87651d53c7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the hall, 6 PA-20T (ROXTON) two-way ceiling speakers are embedded in the suspended ceiling in the 20 W mode.  However, as practice has shown, it will be necessary to rewire to 10 W mode, now there is a very big difference in the sound level in the hall and on the street, but there is no separate adjustment by zones in the amplifier.  Internal loudspeakers are loaded on the no. 1 warning zone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/afc/103/cf0/afc103cf06d998b44e92756ee26d75ea.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Outside there are two outdoor all-weather speakers ROXTON CS-840T with a power of 40 W (notification zone No. 2) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3d7/67e/a01/3d767ea013a1f32fab7fdb2138cc1071.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  For users (of course, not for everyone, but in accordance with the assigned access rights), the sound system can be controlled in two ways: <br><ul><li>  using a computer in the workplace.  VLC player is controlled via web-interface. </li><li>  using a mobile device (phone or tablet) that is running the Android operating system.  Uses the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dorg.peterbaldwin.client.android.vlcremote%26hl%3Dru">VLC remote</a> application.  A tablet or phone is connected to the school network via a WiFi access point. </li></ul><br><br>  Files are replenished into the media library (a network folder on a media server with the appropriate rights assigned) by users themselves (they already know how to do it, hurray - two years have passed for good reason!). <br><br>  For filing voice messages was the idea to use Zello, but the delay was more than 1 second, and this option had to be abandoned. <br><br>  So, below you can see a sound system structural diagram: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b1a/b2e/ba2/b1ab2eba26ed0a634a3ee053e132fd00.png" alt="image"><br><br>  System Specification: <br><br><ul><li>  AZ-560 (Roxton) power amplifier 560 W, 6 zone selector - 19 700 rub. </li><li>  ROXTON CS-840T outdoor loudspeaker 40 W - 2 x 5500 = 11000 rub. </li><li>  PA-20T (ROXTON) - two-way ceiling speaker, 20 W - 6 x 1200 = 7200 rubles. </li><li>  Cable ShVVP 2 * 1.5 - 150 m. X 12 = 1800 rub. </li><li>  PVC corrugated pipe 100 mx 1 = 360 rubles. </li><li>  Distribution box 6 x 30 = 180 rub. </li></ul><br>  Total of about 42 thousand rubles. <br><br>  I paint everything in such detail because from the experience of past publications there will be a lot of questions on implementation from people who are not as savvy as Habr users.  Therefore, I decided that it is better to make the description once detailed and clear even for specialists. <br><br>  Plans for the use of a sound system - morning exercises before classes (in the lobby or on the street, depending on the weather), broadcasting of children's Internet radio stations during breaks and shifts (linked to a schedule). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/225983/">https://habr.com/ru/post/225983/</a></p>
