      Without prehistory in any way <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In early 2008, I decided to become a freelancer, because I thought so, and I reported about the director of UMI-Studio Sergey Kotyrev for more than 2 weeks.  It was a pity for me to part with ‚ÄúUMI-Studio‚Äù then, all the same, to give three years of adult life is not enough by today's standards.  Director Sergey Kotyrev kindly suggested then not to quit right away, but continue to formally enroll in the state, as a friend, to think and return at the same time.  I readily agreed.  He promised to do projects for the studio for the price below market.  So I went to free swimming. <br><br>  Half a year later, director Sergey Kotyrev wrote to me that he didn‚Äôt like the prices that I posted exactly two times, and also said that over the past six months, UMI-Studio paid taxes of 15,000 rubles for me.  This amount, Sergei asked to return any money.  Of course, I was wildly surprised that at the time when Sergei proposed to stay formally in the studio, he did not say anything to me about this. <br><br>  In short.  After three years of work at UMI-Studio, where I was upgraded from designer to art director, I paid 15,000 rubles.  For what?  Just because.  It probably hurt that I never returned.  Although right now, the poh. <br><br>  Therefore, comrades, I strongly recommend that you think 100,000,000 times before you get a job at St. Petersburg's UMI-Studio, which currently occupies 1st place among St. Petersburg's studios.  You may also face unexpected fines. <br><br>  <strong>Epilogue:</strong> <br><br>  I didn‚Äôt even think that I would get such a kick in the ass after 3 years of work in ‚ÄúUMI-Studio‚Äù. <br><br>  Why am I doing this?  It was necessary for someone to do it.  I am a pokhuist in life, so I'm probably the only one who wrote his story of leaving UMI.  So many people left the walls of the studio with an unpleasant aftertaste that it hurts me not even so much for myself - as for all of them.  Each dissatisfied one did not so much complain about the director of the studio, but simply did not understand why it was impossible to do it in an amicable way. <br><br>  I will not go to collect signatures of these people, and to prove something to someone.  Just wanted to tell. <br>  Thank you all. <br><br><habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/25342/">https://habr.com/ru/post/25342/</a></p>
