The mission of this event is to find new CRM stars and help them become more famous. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The authors of the competition are recognized experts in the industry and constantly receive letters asking them to review a particular product.  When the number of requests exceeded all imaginable boundaries, there was nothing else to do but arrange the requests and create a ‚Äúscene‚Äù in which CRM companies would compete for the title of the best CRM system. <br><br>  The title of honor was jokingly suggested to call CRM Idol, by analogy with American Idol.  I liked the joke, the name stuck and decided to leave it as it is.  The analogy really accurately reflects the essence of the event - both of which are engaged in the search for talents. <br><br>  The competition was held among 20 EMEA companies and 40 from the States, respectively, 2 companies won.  Consisted of 3 stages: <br>  1. Presentation of the product and company to the four judges. <br>  2. Interviews with product creators <br>  3. Open voting

      Terrasoft was lucky to participate in the competition with the new <a href="http://www.terrasoft.ru/products/CRM/bpmonlinecrm">BPMonline CRM</a> solution.  This is a SaaS CRM system, a unique feature of which is the presence of a platform built on business processes.  While classic CRM systems are still only a data warehouse, we wanted to create a solution that will help users not to get lost in the information debris.  As the map helps to get to the desired place, the process indicates the shortest route to perform a job. <br><br>  In practice, this means that the user can independently in the graphical editor specify the logic of the system.  Knowing the logic, the system will continue to prompt the user with the necessary steps and perform routine tasks for him.  For example, after receiving an incoming email from a client, you can tell the system to automatically create a task, start a new user card and change the values ‚Äã‚Äãof certain fields.  Coffee, of course, BPMonilne CRM does not cook, but all the ‚Äúmonkey work‚Äù can be passed on to it.  It was with such an almost fabulous system that we won the competition. <br><br>  We wrote about all stages of the competition in detail in our <a href="http://www.community.terrasoft.ru/blogs/7057">community</a> .  Separately mention only the final.  The organizers decided to make it as unbiased as possible, therefore not only the chief judges took part in the final vote.  The extended panel of judges includes more than 50 bloggers, journalists and market experts.  Moreover, any Internet user could vote.  To make it easier for both of them to understand the proposed solutions, the finalists were asked to make short videos that were uploaded to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results%3Fsearch_query%3Dcrm%2Bidol%26aq%3Df">youtube</a> .  On the rollers and the final battle and will be discussed further. <br><br><h4>  What interesting things have we learned during this time? </h4><br><h5>  Different preferences </h5><br>  The preferences of Americans and Europeans are different.  Among the American finalists, 3 out of 4 were Social CRM.  In Europe, by contrast, all decisions were classic.  In fact, only we offered social media integration. <br><br><h5>  Social orientation </h5><br>  In America, won the most social product of all social - <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/">Get Satisfaction</a> .  I do not know how to correctly translate the name into Russian, most likely ‚ÄúCatch the High‚Äù.  Very good, considering that the product is very good.  The company's mission is to bring humanity to CRM.  Product policy is very curious, because  marketers managed to very nicely build up from competitors.  While the majority of CRM vendors talk about KPI, ROI and other business metrics, Get Satisfaction (GS) says that customer relations are not indicators, but primarily people.  And they suggest focusing on communication, not numbers. <br><br><h5>  Key to victory </h5><br>  The winners were the videos that were able to convey the idea in an extremely simple form.  GS showed their idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhumanity CRM on an anti-example talking robot, personifying old-fashioned approaches.  In the video about BPMonline, we wanted to convey the idea that processes surround us everywhere, even while we are making scrambled eggs.  Since the process approach itself is a rather complicated topic, our video turned out to be larger than that of our colleagues from GS, but in the end we invested in 4 minutes and a half.  Considering that the usual presentation of a BPMonline CRM product usually takes about an hour, we can say that we have achieved 15-fold compression of information, which is an achievement in itself. <br><br><h5>  Methods of struggle </h5><br>  The fight was also interesting.  Judging by the <a href="http://twitter.com/">tweet tape</a> , European companies have been significantly less active than American ones.  We had concerns that experienced Western Internet marketers would crush us with the number of publications and the ubiquitous online presence.  It turned out that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DklFdNo0RGvM">our video</a> collected the most views and likes.  Only habrahabr gave us more than 500, which was a pleasant surprise for us.  By the way, from all the staff of Terrasoft, I want to say a big human thanks to the habrawers that voted for us. <br><br>  I do not want to end the post with some sort of banalism, but the main benefit that we received in this competition is a great experience.  We want the BPMonilne example to inspire young and ambitious developers not to be afraid to go west.  Everything is the same there, only less bureaucracy. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/132425/">https://habr.com/ru/post/132425/</a></p>
