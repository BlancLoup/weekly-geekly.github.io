  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Review of the photo editor Corel PaintShop Pro X6</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  Part 1: Feature Overview </h4><br>  The process of preparing photographs for most amateur photographers follows a similar scenario.  First you need to disassemble the materials of the next shooting or travel, select the best and make some kind of photo chronicle.  Then convert the photo from the RAW, fix the flaws of shooting and landscape defects and bring the photos to a "delicious" look.  And, finally, create a ready-made collection for posting on the Web, and process individual images more carefully - for printing in landscape or wall format. <br><br>  Most of this processing is done in powerful graphic packages, such as Adobe PhotoShop, and the analysis of photographic materials, their storage and cataloging is done either with the help of separate utilities, or they do it in a completely handicraft way.  The new version of the package Corel PaintShop Pro X6 does not claim direct competition from Adobe PhotoShop in the field of graphics and design, but for photo amateurs it may be preferable.  At least that allows you to quickly go through all the stages of the process - from working with the photo archive and finding the right photos by the specified parameters and ending with their placement on the Web or printing.  In the first part, I tried to give a brief overview of the main functions of the product, and in later we will look at the advantages of PaintShop Pro in performing specific tasks in detail. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Interface and Navigation </h5><br>  The interface of the sixth version is significantly reworked compared to the previous ones.  The three tabs at the top of the window (Management, Setup and Edit) are associated with three stages of the process - searching and selecting the right photos, basic settings during conversion from RAW (exposure compensation, levels, lights / shadows, noise reduction), and finally, final processing photo and save in the right format.  This approach eliminates the need to select files (for printing, for the Web, for display) and decompose them into separate folders: the system remembers which photo is being processed at the moment and allows you to freely switch between these three modules.  For example, during editing, you can return to the Settings tab (the system will prompt you to save the file), quickly adjust the exposure settings, and then continue processing the photo. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c10/9df/4b7/c109df4b724d5b3a3f6538db471d8c43.png"><br>  <i>The program interface allows you to freely switch between navigation, setting basic parameters and editing</i> <i><br></i>

      Owners of large photo archives will be relevant feature to create collections.  You can do them yourself, or provide it to the system by turning on the filter by the specified parameters.  PaintShop Pro X6 automatically indexes the viewed photos and allows them to be grouped by date, EXIF ‚Äã‚Äãparameters, size or even location on the map, if geotagging was turned on during the shooting.  There is also a built-in calendar that allows you to quickly view all the pictures taken on a specific date. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/323/3df/578/3233df5785d0d2a8bbc410c04821d4d4.png"><br>  <i>The filter allows you to display all images that match the specified parameters ...</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2ac/cdc/a00/2accdca0063fc166ebf9f31cc43c2e61.png"><br>  <i>... and the Calendar are photos taken on a given date.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/58e/719/89b/58e71989b9bdf24fd06dddce63c63e29.png"><br>  The bottom panel of the ‚ÄúManagement‚Äù module allows you to quickly share selected photos in social networks (Facebook, Twitter and Google+ are available), import GPS bindings into EXIF ‚Äã‚Äã(this can be done using GPX / KML, Facebook files or manually specifying coordinates) and perform a number of other actions. .  Interesting feature "Share your trip."  If geotags are already available in the EXIF ‚Äã‚Äãdata of the photos or the coordinates are specified manually, it allows you to build an interactive travel map in a couple of clicks: it‚Äôs enough to mark those images that you want to see on the map. <br><br><h5>  Creating an interactive travel map </h5><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/72a/e05/251/72ae0525150135fd5540383832db113a.png"><br>  <i>1) Photos are attached location data</i> <i><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ff0/557/f47/ff0557f474e642313bdbcb87f2641883.png"><br></i>  <i>2) An interactive route map is created based on geotagging</i> <i><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/360/c03/6e3/360c036e39f1653b7228a76382da8f0b.png"><br></i>  <i>3) The map is saved in HTML format.</i>  <i>It can be placed on the site, uploaded to Dropbox and shared on Facebook, or used offline.</i> <i><br></i> <br><br>  The function of printing a contact sheet will be useful when selecting photos for printing, or for quickly creating a small portfolio that allows a photographer to show examples of his work - for example, when organizing an exhibition or for use in booklets and guidebooks.  The basis for taking pictures from the current folder or collection, and their location and size, you can choose using a large number of templates. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0d7/59e/068/0d759e068f30b3ea35d2009153d00801.png"><br>  <i>A large number of templates are available when printing a contact sheet.</i> <br><br><h5>  RAW conversion and pre-processing </h5><br>  Going to the "Settings" tab, the user enters the interface of a fairly advanced RAW converter.  These operations are usually performed in Adobe LightRoom, or in software supplied with the camera.  However, Corel PaintShop Pro X6 can be a serious competition here: the module turned out to be quite functional and fast, and the ability to instantly switch from viewing mode and back significantly saves time.  The list of supported cameras is quite large;  among them, and most recently appeared models.  For example, with the Nikon D600 RAW files, supported so far by only a few third-party products, I had no difficulty. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b14/7a5/ab9/b147a5ab97ebeb1377b580a8fadbe6d2.png"><br>  <i>The ‚ÄúSetup‚Äù module combines the functions of a RAW converter and the filter menu of the well-known Instagram</i> <br><br>  On the left is all the functionality of setting and converting the image, which I will focus on later, and on the right is a special menu for those who do not want to delve into all the subtleties of the curves, levels and white balance, but expect a ‚Äúwow effect‚Äù in a couple of clicks.  The latter is somewhat reminiscent of the Instagram filter menu: you can select the desired effect (increase or decrease the contrast, stylize an old photo, etc.) and immediately apply it to the photo.  Various design elements are also concentrated here, as well as imitation of different types of films and vignetting.  The most interesting effects include imitation of infrared film (several modes available), old color photography (muted colors and imitation of coarse grain), daguerreotype of the late XIX-early XX century, soft filter, tone map (similar to images obtained during Tone Mapping in HDR), ‚ÄúInto the Sun‚Äù (imitation of shooting on a sunny day), smoothing the skin, imitating a pencil drawing or viewing through a patterned glass. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9b7/b1b/97a/9b7b1b97ad9906a322623e89373841f5.png"><br>  <i>Instant effects menu contains a large number of filters, divided into groups</i> <br><br>  The left menu is for those who have experience in image processing.  Top down are located: <br>  - Combined histograms for each of the image channels <br>  - A set of quick tools (cropping, correcting the horizon, eliminating the red-eye effect, "cosmetic bag" for face correction and a cloning brush acting in a similar way with the Stamp tool ‚Äî you can use it to blur image defects). <br><br>  - Conversion settings, divided into several groups (intellectual correction, white balance, brightness / contrast, lighting / clarity, local tonal matching, high-frequency filtering and noise reduction). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/efb/9f2/2c0/efb9f22c0f5d2193f1f3758ec57530d3.png"><br>  <i>The RAW Converter Panel offers a rich and well-grouped set of options.</i> <br><br>  We will dwell on these functions in more detail in the review dedicated to converting photos from RAW, but for now let's move on to a brief overview of editing options. <br><br><h5>  Photo editing </h5><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c4c/3b2/048/c4c3b2048f0ffb717ec08e8881233f20.png"><br>  <i>Everyone familiar with PhotoShop can easily figure out the photo editor interface.</i> <br><br>  Most editing functions are focused on the Edit tab.  The interface of this module resembles Adobe PhotoShop, and anyone familiar with this product can easily figure it out.  The left panel contains the main tools (framing, brush, pipette, fill, and others).  Their functionality is almost the same as the last one.  Here are the functions of quick horizon straightening and perspective correction.  When you select a tool, its parameters are displayed at the top of the window.  PaintShop Pro X6 is specific to only the last panel: it echoes another product from this manufacturer, Corel Painter (formerly Fractal Design Painter) and allows you to simulate various graphic and painting materials ‚Äî oil, watercolor, pastel, pencil and others.  Here is a palette that allows you to get different shades by mixing strokes: the finished work can be supplemented with pictorial elements, although Corel Painter is better for creating art canvases from scratch. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/373/02e/bf0/37302ebf017a4c68bd2c2903b2d1b488.png"><br>  <i>In PaintShop Pro X6 there is a tool that simulates various styles of painting, as well as a palette for mixing strokes</i> <br><br>  On the right is the training center panel (as you go, quite sensible contextual hints on the use of one or another tool or function are displayed here, which saves beginners from having to scroll through the manual for a long time), as well as various additional parameters.  By default, there are also rendered color search and work with layers, but you can add additional ones - for example, the menu of instant effects already discussed above. <br><br>  Above, under the main menu, there are quick access buttons and an interesting ‚ÄúPhoto enhancement‚Äù panel.  It allows you to significantly improve the image in a couple of clicks.  One-step photo correction is similar to the automatic color correction in PhotoShop (Auto Levels), however, according to my feelings, it works softer, and the result of its work is in most cases closer to the ideal.  "Smart Photo Correction" acts in a similar way, while displaying a number of parameters for fine adjustment manually.  Here you can remove the noise, adjust the white balance and a number of other parameters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/866/a17/b46/866a17b46928398ab815f74902c90ad0.png"><br>  <i>The "Photo Enhancement" menu contains a set of tools for quick photo correction.</i> <br><br>  That's all for now.  A detailed overview of the functionality of each of the modules, work with layers, masks and blending modes, as well as examples of specific tasks for preparing photos in PaintShop Pro are the topics of the following publications.  The developers managed to combine in this product a user-friendly interface and powerful functionality of a professional graphic package, and therefore the description of all the features of the product is beyond the scope of a single article. <br><br>  Alexey Polyakov </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/212171/">https://habr.com/ru/post/212171/</a></p>
