  <section class="page js-page"><h1>App Store - getting money</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  When we first started to deal with the creation of applications for the iPhone / iPod Touch, the question of legalizing the receipt of money was urgent, because  Yablochniki send them only to a bank account. <br>  We registered the account on an individual, but due to our interesting legislation, the problem is absolutely relevant for company accounts. <br><br>  Everything described below applies to Ukraine.  In other countries, as far as I spoke with the developers, life is simpler and things are better, but I will not say for sure, because  hands did not feel. <br><br>  So, there are 2 main options for opening a currency account for receiving money from abroad by SWIFT transfer: <i>the company's account</i> (PE, LLC, JSC - no difference) and an <i>individual</i> (private person) <i>account</i> .

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><h6>  Advantages of the first: </h6><br><br><ul><li>  ability to pay taxes less than 15% personal income tax </li><li>  PF issues are dealt with in the same way as money-related ones. </li><li>  everything is white, clean and wonderful </li></ul><br><br>  Minuses: <br><br><ul><li>  Signature / seal contract required </li><li>  admission must be confirmed by an act </li><li>  the note to the payment must include the number of the contract and the act </li><li>  inability to get dollars on hand.  Only sale on the interbank market </li></ul><br><br>  We arrived.  It is unrealistic to beg Apple to make an exception for itself and to conclude normal contracts, to sign each transfer, it is easier to assemble the rover already. <br><br>  Therefore, we proceed to point two. <br><br><h6>  Physical Account </h6><br><br>  It opens in 5 minutes, the card in a couple of days on hand.  Then everything will be told on the example of ProCredit Bank.  This is not advertising, I just have been serving there for 2 years and there are no complaints. <br><br>  When I asked how they would look at constant SWIFT transfers from the USA to my account and what limits on the amount of transfer at which they did not <s>knock to</s> start financial monitoring, received the following (numbers in hryvnias): <br><ol><li>  up to 100 thousand one-time income they are not interested in my person </li><li>  100-300 thousand and I talk with my manager about the translation </li><li>  300 thousand and above - talk with the head of the site </li></ol><br><br>  According to them, the data in the tax they do not transmit. <br><br>  But there is one thing - in the notes to the translation there should not be <b>any</b> mention at all that this is somehow related to entrepreneurial activity, due to the fact that an individual does not have the right to conduct it. <br>  However, selling your games / programs on the App Store is not an entrepreneurial activity, but <b>royalties</b> are deductions for copyright / <br><br>  By that time, I had already heard that Apple does not make notes and decided to take a chance. <br><br>  After the first translation, I was already calm - the note was, but it contained only completely unintelligible information.  To be completely accurate, it contained product codes and amounts earned from their sale minus 30% of the app.  Further contained the same. <br><br>  <b>Conclusions:</b> it is possible to work in Ukraine with the App Store, but it is fraught.  Because  With these incomes, you must pay another 15% personal income tax. <br><br>  Any questions to the wolves, I have had enough time with it in my time, I am ready to clarify and help. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/82758/">https://habr.com/ru/post/82758/</a></p>
