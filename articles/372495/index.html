And most of the theories are clearly written about films and for movie viewers.  I did not want to reprint these theories, especially since I do not like many.  Therefore, we will not build fan theories today, as usual.  Instead, I propose to consider a full-fledged conspiracy theory. <br><br>  Just in case, I must say (and then you never know) that all this is not serious, I am not a supporter of conspiracy theories in any way, but if I did, I would prefer this one. <br><br><h4>  Legendarium </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d01/423/692/d014236923714767b82715eba3fd165b.jpg"><br><br>  There are several types of narration; in some, events are described as some kind of objective truth.  We watch everything as if through a window.  But in the Lord of the Rings, we are not at all an objective viewer, this story has a narrator and not one.  Regardless of whether you are watching a movie or reading a book, you only follow the point of view of the character of the narrator. <br><br>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD">The Silmarillion</a> describing the beginning and, in part, the end of the world, was created by elves and is a collection of legends.  In fact, it is an analogue of the Old Testament.  From the language of the elves, Bilbo translated the book.  Bilbo Baggins is also the author of the story "The Hobbit, or there and back."  Both stories were later added and edited by Frodo, who described all the events of the Lord of the Rings.  All together - this is the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0">Scarlet Book of the Western Limits.</a> <br><br>  By the way, this explains the difference between the Hobbit (in fact, a children's fairy tale) and the Lord of the Rings. <br>  Bilbo went through an exciting adventure and composed a fairy tale based on.  Frodo, having gone through hell, was more like the writers of a lost generation.  Because the Lord of the Rings turned out much more detailed and darker. <br><br>  After Frodo sailed away with the Elves to Aman, the book was passed on to Sam, who led the chronicle of Shir in it.  The book was later requested by the king of Gondor Elessar (Aragorn).  He ordered his scribes to reproduce the book.  In the process of copying, many changes were made and it is this version that has reached our days (the original has been lost). <br>  Since then, according to Tolkien, four epochs have changed (the exact length of epochs is almost impossible to calculate. In fact, hundreds of thousands, or even millions of years have passed. But no more than 100 million, since the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D1%258F%25D0%25B4%25D1%258B_(%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B2%25D1%2591%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5)">Pleiades</a> cluster can be seen from the earth).  The version that reached us was translated by Tolkien himself. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>This story is about very old times.</i>  <i>And the languages ‚Äã‚Äãand letters then were not at all the same as those that we use now.</i>  <i>All languages ‚Äã‚Äãhere are replaced by English.</i> <i><br></i> <br>  From the Preface to the Hobbit <br></blockquote><br><br>  Thus, the author himself becomes a character who translated the story told by another character.  In this vein, many events can be questioned.  Not only is the hobbit describing them (and the hobbits are quite close-minded), there are also so many changes and God knows what happened to the book for hundreds of thousands of years. <br>  Considering how little we know about the past of the Earth, the Lord of the Rings could happen twice, and we would not know about it. <br><br><h4>  Hobbit lived in a burrow underground </h4><br>  The Silmarillion contains information on the origins of humans, elves, and gnomes.  But no one knows where the hobbits came from (like the orcs).  Perhaps it is precisely because of this that the ring is so difficult to seduce the Hobbit, because Sauron did not take them into account and knew almost nothing about them when he created the ring. <br><br>  There is a theory that xobits are plants created by the wives of the Ents.  According to another theory, they are a mixture of dwarves and elves.  Tolkien himself, said that hobbits are closer to humans and are a parallel branch of evolution.  Against this background, certain <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A7%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA_%25D1%2584%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9">archaeological finds of</a> 2003 look very funny. <br><br><h4>  The magician is never late </h4><br>  At the time when the events of the Lord of the Rings occur, magic gradually leaves the world.  It's funny, because in parallel, people get more and more power and knowledge (something reminds me of it). <br><br>  Here is very remarkable character Gandalf.  If you approach people on the street and ask about the most famous magicians in fiction and cinema, Mithrandir will definitely be in the top three.  Meanwhile, the magic of the magician Gandalf raises many questions.  If you quickly recall the film, then you can name not so many places where Gandalf used his magical skills. <br><br>  To begin with, where is the "stored" magic of Gandalf.  When the remnants of the brotherhood arrive in Rohan, Grimm, fearing Gandalf, asks him to take away his staff.  Grimm, as we recall, serves Saruman.  Those.  it can be assumed that he is much better than others is aware of what exactly the danger of Gandalf and he assumes that the danger comes from the staff. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/iQExgALv9wI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhUl_4V1V3mY1TYHgtFWLLh6BHzqA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  By the way, Saruman took the staff from Gandalf in the scene in the tower.  This fight, of course, was more like magic.  Yes, and they waved their hands, but (!) It is important to understand that the storyteller is still Frodo, and at the time of the battle only Gandalf and Saruman were present.  And only Gandalf could tell Frodo how it was.  And Gandalf seems interested in maintaining his magical prestige. <br><br>  If Gandalf can hurl people with the power of thought, would it not be wiser to do this in battles with orcs, for example?  But instead, we see outstanding possession of the sword, and the staff is often used as a melee weapon.  This skill does not appear out of nowhere.  It turns out Gandalf spends a lot of time in order to maintain combat form.  But with the magic he has worse. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/51b/995/dea/51b995dea4884d3c963c68a4b6d618a2.jpg"><br><br>  After the prologue, in the film, Gandalf arrives in the Shire.  Here, a lot of things worth paying attention to.  In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D0cySlDepwA0">this</a> scene, for example, both in the book and in the film, everything is shown in such a way as if Gandalf scares Bilbo with some magic, although he could simply use natural physical superiority + a game of shadows from the fire in the fireplace. <br><br>  The second point, and it is much more interesting.  Gandalf arranges a presentation using a pile of fireworks.  The latter might have seemed magical to the near hobbits, but this is not the point.  First, why does a mage need fireworks to entertain the Hobbits?  Did not find a suitable spell?  A little later, Gandalf doesn‚Äôt shy away from letting in magical smoky ships (here I must say that modern Vapers, too, would find something to strike Bilbo) <br><br>  Secondly, fireworks, like Bengal lights (like many other things) in our world appeared only due to military use.  The basis of fireworks - gunpowder, or something else burning and exploding.  Did Gandalf could not find a better use of gunpowder than entertainment for the Hobbits? <br>  It's funny that gunpowder (or analogue) was also used by orcs during the siege of Helm's Deep.  It was thanks to the bomb (and the fact that the same person as the Death Star apparently designed the Hedmy Falls wall) that they broke through the defenses. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/8M41kl3xOaQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhi9-zEM4hBA5u47HidzKC02wYI87Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Thus, Gandalf and Saruman know the secret of gunpowder, but none of them use it to arm their troops.  Although I can immediately come up with a bunch of moments when a firearm, or a bomb, could turn the tide of the war in one direction or another. <br><br>  Let's return to the gray (for the time being) mage.  In one scene, Sam asks Gandalf not to turn him into a frog, although there is no evidence that Gandalf is able to do that at all. <br><br>  For this scene and many others, it‚Äôs imposing that the inhabitants of Middle-earth don‚Äôt have any idea what Gandalf is capable of, but they are absolutely sure that they are ‚Äúmagical‚Äù thanks to several skillful tricks. <br><br>  Here is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DmJZZNHekEQw">scene</a> with the Balrog, where Gandalf pulls down the bridge.  At least it seemed so to the frightened Hobbit.  And what he saw - Gandalf said "you will not pass" and the Balrog fell.  But later does not mean in consequence.  The barlog is obviously a hefty creature, and the bridge is narrow, built by dwarves and meant for dwarves, who has not seen scheduled repair work for many years.  His collapse could have happened for more natural reasons, and the wave that we see before it, if it was not only the fruit of the imagination of shocked Frodo, who had lost a friend, may be easier to explain than magic. <br><br><blockquote>  The laws of film narration are not so different from the literary ones, and the weakness of bad films is often exaggerated, and in introducing unnecessary details, which comes from a lack of understanding of the essence of the original.  C. introduced the "magic castle", countless eagles, spells, blue flashes and inappropriate magic (for example, the floating body of Faramir). <br>  <i>Letter # 210 to Forest Ackerman, June 1958 (J.R.R.Tolkien)</i> <i><br></i>  <i>(Tolkien comments on the movie of the Lord of the Rings)</i> <br></blockquote><br><br>  It‚Äôs important to say, until they crucify me, I don‚Äôt consider Gandalf a ‚Äúbad guy.‚Äù  On the contrary, his character seems to me only more interesting from this point of view.  He is not just smart, his cunning reaches a brilliant scale.  He is a great strategist that showed his attack on the Orcs at Helm's Deep and the defense of Minas Tirith. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Eagles!</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  A popular topic for Lord of the Rings controversy is the Eagles.  When watching a movie, some have a logical question: why don't they just fly all the way to the eagles.  If you read books, you hardly had a similar question.  But for all the others, there is a theory that Gandalf initially planned to do just that. <br><br>  According to the theory, Gandalf enlisted the support of eagles on his way to Rivendel, but he could not share the plan with the others, because he feared the spies of Sauron.  According to the plan of Gandalf, the brotherhood of the ring was to be sent to the valley where the Eagles lived, immediately after passing through the Hazy Mountains.  Trouble in Moria mixed his cards.  After returning as Gandalf of the White, he forgot almost everything that was in his past life and, therefore, did not use his plan.  Yes, and the brotherhood at that time fell apart and the plan no longer fit. <br>  As evidence in favor of this theory, Gendolf‚Äôs phrase before a fall is cited.  He says: ‚ÄúFly, you fouls!‚Äù.  Which, in theory, means "Run, fools," but it can literally be translated as "fly fools." <br><br>  Honestly, I think that this theory does not hold water.  To begin with, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãflying to Mordor on the Eagles is stupid.  In terms of what it should look like on the board: <br>  - We need a plan, how to quietly get into the very heart of the enemy's fortress, without attracting attention and letting him know that we have the ring. <br>  ‚ÄúI have an idea, let's take 9 eagles, each the size of a cart, and fly straight to the fateful mountain.‚Äù  I am sure that that eye on the tower is just for the sake of appearance and will not be able to detect us, even when we, having made a circle of honor and having waved our wing, will not land on the fateful mountain. <br>  In addition, the plan to deliver the ring to Mordor was born on the council, Gandalf could not plan everything in advance without knowing the plan. <br>  Even if we assume that they could fly to Mordor unnoticed (although they could not).  But then they had to fly over the crowds of orcs and meet them at the foot of the mountain.  What about the fact that a ring with its own will could well fall in flight and roll off its feet to the first orc that came across? <br><br>  Among other things, the eagles owe nothing to Gandalf.  He helped one of them, but in response, the same eagle saved Gandalf from Isengard, after the battle with the Balrog, and also helped pick Frodo and Sam from the fatal mountain. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/13c/527/aa2/13c527aa2a544e00a880d25fc16745ee.jpg"><br><br>  In the end, it was quite possible to rely on the eagles.  There was a choice - to die, or perhaps die.  The eagles could not cope, they could be intercepted by the Nazgul, but this was no longer important.  Task completed. <br><br>  And by the way, here is an excerpt from the same letter of Tolkien about the failed (fortunately) adaptation: <br><blockquote>  <i>Here we meet for the first time with eagles.</i>  <i>It seems to me that the eagles are the biggest and unjustified, the mistake of Ts. Eagles is a dangerous weapon.</i>  <i>I used them extremely rarely, using them more would be both implausible and impossible.</i>  <i>And how is it possible to ride the eagle of the Hazy Mountains in the Shire?</i>  <i>This is a complete absurdity, it makes the capture of Gandalf Saruman improbable, and also deprives the escape of Gandalf of any mystery.</i> </blockquote><br></div></div><br><br><h5>  Lord of the Rings </h5><br>  Gandalf is not the only "non-magical" magic character.  Sauron is the main antagonist in the book and film, right?  But he did not do anything throughout history.  There is an Eye and there is a ring.  With the help of the palantir, you can "talk" with him, but it does not explain in any way what Sauron is.  If we assume that the Silmarillion is a collection of legends, and not a true chronology, then there is no evidence that Sauron exists at all. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>I hope to soon present you with two books about which at least one critical comment will be fair: they are too long!</i>  <i>One is the sequel to The Hobbit, which I just finished 12 years later (irregular) works.</i>  <i>I am afraid that this book is three times longer, not intended for children (although it is not at all necessary for them to be completely unsuitable) and in places quite gloomy.</i>  <i>It seems to me that it is much better (but in a different way).</i>  <i>The second is a pure myth, legends of the past, quite far back in the days of Bilbo.</i> <br><br>  From Tolkien's letter to Nomi Mitchison <br>  December 13, 1949 <br>  . </blockquote><br><br>  There is an interesting theory that the ring has not only the will but also the consciousness.  And this consciousness calls itself Gollum.  The name Gollum could be taken from the Old Norse language, which has the word gull (another form is goll), which means ‚Äúgold, treasure, jewel‚Äù, and in the phrase fingr-gull also means ‚Äúring‚Äù. <br><br>  If you recall, three different characters (Isildur, Gollum and Bilbo) called the ring charm, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DGOdhYU1s9cc">here</a> , at 1:54, Bilbo says "Golum."  those.  the influence of the ring is not just a desire, it is conscious phrases and even behavior.  The ring acts as a parasite on the one hand (the original appearance is lost, behavior changes) and a symbiote on the other (increased longevity, invisibility).  I'm not sure about Gollum.  but here, too, there is something to think about ... The main tactical decisions were made by Saruman, right up to the fall of Isengard.  Also, Sauron had his own ‚Äúvoice‚Äù, an ordinary person who communicates the will of the dark lord and there is a king sorcerer, the leader of the troops.  Those.  in a sense, <s>Big Brother</s> Sauron exists, but rather as a collection of ideas. <br><br>  I could present Sauron as an alternative to SkyNet.  AI encased in a shell, but destroyed long ago.  However, information about it is copied into the ring.  Fortunately, there is no evidence to defend this theory, so the theory is not about that. <br><br><h5>  All the same clark law </h5><br>  Imagine, for a second, that Gandalf, Saruman, Sauron, Elves, and many other supernatural beings are a super-developed civilization, terrestrial or alien.  Using high-tech devices, they could impress the inhabitants of the earth. <br><br>  The film gives the impression that people in Middle-earth are quite developed in crafts, but this is not so. <br><br><blockquote>  Why Gandalv and Theoden do not go to the open space in front of the doors, as I said?  Yes, I kind of enriched the culture of the ‚Äúheroic‚Äù Rohirrim, but the case does not reach the glass windows that can be flung open !!!  You might think we are in a hotel.  (The ‚ÄúEastern windows‚Äù of the palace, II 116, 119 [345], were only narrow, unglazed slits under the roof overhangs.) <br><br>  From the letter about the film adaptation of Zimmerman <br></blockquote><br><br>  Those.  in fact, at that time, metals could not be studied.  Then mithril could be aluminum, and any solid alloy would seem to people indestructible.  Even gold could be too hard for people of that time, not to mention steel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/520/0c8/dbb/5200c8dbb3b64dd583d75fa3103e7090.jpg"><br><br>  What is especially interesting is that at the end all the elves swim to Aman (read paradise), taking Frodo with him as a reward, you can only get there on an elven ship.  So maybe Haman is not on earth at all? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a07/e4c/d7f/a07e4cd7fccf44df96894ee37a6483bf.jpg"><br><br>  I have little evidence of this theory, it looks loose and I have not thought of much yet.  And yet, it seems to me there are no particularly strong contradictions, if we consider that the book was written by the Hobbit.  Also in the process I came across the book <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2586%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2586">‚ÄúThe Last Koltsenosets‚Äù</a> where, it seems, the events of the Sovereign seem to be told, but without magic.  Unfortunately, I did not have time to read the book, but I will be glad if those who read it will write off in the comments. <br><br>  Tolkien himself, by the way, did not make a big difference between technology and magic.  And disliked them regardless of the name. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Technology and Magic Attitudes</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><blockquote>  <i>I can not stand Allegory - conscious and intentional allegory - and, however, all attempts to explain the essence of the myth and the fairy tale of necessity involve the language of allegory.</i>  <i>(And, of course, the more ‚Äúlife‚Äù in the history, the more easily allegorical interpretations are applicable to it; and the better an intentional allegory is made, the sooner it will be perceived simply as a story.)

I can‚Äôt just express to you the whole degree of my disgust for the third kind of troops - which nevertheless can (and for me it is) combine with admiration, gratitude and above all pity for the young men who have pleased him.  But the true villain is a military plane.  And nothing can calm my grief at the fact that you, my most beloved person, are connected with him at least somewhat.  My feelings are more or less comparable with those that Frodo would have experienced if he found that some hobbits learn to fly on Nazgul birds "in the name of the liberation of the Shire." <br><br>  From a letter to Christopher Tolkien <br></blockquote><br><br></div></div><br><br><h5>  Heir </h5><br>  If you might not like the previous theory, then I think you will appreciate this one. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/63f/f0f/c02/63ff0fc02dde4039bc8b2335c8c5e3fc.jpg"><br><br>  It is known that King Elessar (Aragorn), founded his ruling house: Telkontar.  It can be assumed that House Telkontar multiplied and flourished.  The presence of elven blood was supposed to prolong life and make the descendants of Aragorn rather tenacious.  Hundreds of thousands of years, or even millions, have changed their spelling, especially considering that the letter was forgotten and reinvented.  Thus, Telcontar turned into Telcon, and still later into Tolkien.  Perhaps the other descendants of Aragorn have already tried to tell parts of the book, thus the Nibelungen Rings, the Story of King Arthur, Beowulf (and much more than the author was actually inspired) appeared.  Why did only Tolkien tell the whole story?  Just being a gifted philologist, he studied languages ‚Äã‚Äãfor so long that he was able to translate the Scarlet Book (written in several languages) and the runes. <br><br>  Thus, Tolkien is one of the descendants of Aragorn and the keeper of the Scarlet Book. <br><br>  That's all.  Sorry, if it turned out messy, I had to write with huge breaks.  In any case, thanks for reading.
