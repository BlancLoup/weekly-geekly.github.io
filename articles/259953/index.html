  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Connect any site to PushAll via RSS. Converter feeds to push notifications</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h1>  Introduction </h1><br>  The service was created as a notification system for users from any site that integrated the PushAll API. <br>  However, not everyone can agree, the giants will not pay attention at all for a long time.  In this case, at the moment, most of the users receive exactly the news notifications from the sites, and not personal ones.  On this occasion, I was recently advised to integrate RSS feeds.  That is, in fact, PushAll becomes a kind of RSS aggregator, while in fact ordinary users most often do not need the usual tape aggregators - they go to the sites themselves and read the news already on them. <br><br> <a href="https://pushall.ru/%3Ffs%3D150"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4bf/2ec/b1b/4bf2ecb1b94e4530afee4e27dab222b2"></a> <br><br>  In this regard, PushAll has gone its own way - it does not collect all the tapes into one.  He only takes the tape, connects it with the channels and makes the distribution based on the filter.  That is, a user interested in articles and news of certain topics will receive a notification about this immediately.  He can read less useful information later on his own. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

      In this case, the user does not have to be the site administrator, he can be his reader and create a special channel.  In the future, if the copyright holder wants to get administrative access to the channel, he will need to contact support and provide proof of ownership.  In this case, the channel will be fully transferred to the true owner. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  This is already there, but more is possible. </h1><br>  I will not deny all the tips about RSS were with an eye to Pushbullet.  For some time I googled information on aggregators - they all hide the update time.  I hardly found out that Feedly updates the feeds usually only once every 2-4 hours.  And the minimum update time is almost 30 minutes.  At Pushbullet, I did not find any information on updating the feeds at all. <br><br>  I also want to not just copy this functionality - I want to expand it.  For example, a site may have several sources, this includes YouTube and a personal site and possibly a blog.  In the future, you can add multiple tapes to one channel.  Also, I will try to make a system for eliminating repetitions.  That is, a video published on YouTube will be sent out once, not three times, for each of the sources.  Also, as a rule, not everything should be sent.  For each RSS feed you can set a separate filter, for example, podcasts can be pushed, and something from the category of add-ons to the news can be omitted.  Also, the update time should depend on the number of subscribers. <br><br><h1>  What is done now, what are the limitations? </h1><br>  At the moment, the minimum functionality is ready - adding one tape to one channel.  The channel must be public.  You can set the update period yourself.  For example, if you are sure that one news per week is published on the site, you can set the period once every 2-3 hours or more. <br>  Also, the update period depends on the number of subscribers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cd9/f0f/512/cd9f0f5125284b0dabcc1c519ea8be75"><br><br>  The screenshot above shows all the restrictions.  In short - the more subscribers you have, the more often the channel can be updated.  From 1 hour and up to 1 minute. <br><br>  The update algorithm is currently very simple.  It is single threaded.  He tries to download the first 512 kilobytes of RSS, if he doesn't, he downloads everything.  For verification, only the first entry is always taken, it is not checked whether it was sent earlier.  First of all, support for fast scanning will be improved.  Many channels have caching support when the channel responds with 304, in case there is no new data, and support for retrieving only new entries. <br>  For testing, it is necessary to have as many different channels as possible in order to identify possible problems and optimize work with them. <br><br><h1>  What is the result? </h1><br>  Now users are less dependent on sites.  They can independently create feeds with RSS feeds and receive the information they need in the form of Push notifications on an Android smartphone and Chrome browser. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/259953/">https://habr.com/ru/post/259953/</a></p>
