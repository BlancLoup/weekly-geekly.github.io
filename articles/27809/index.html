  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Social network for finding doubles</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Something for myself I can not find today anything interesting to read :).  Perhaps lay out for a change another of their ideas for discussion.  The project proposed for implementation is based on 2 main prerequisites: 1) now social networks are very popular in the world, I think it‚Äôs not necessary to give their names - they are already widely known (well, the same Yandex moikrug.ru).  Almost any social network is based on some theory - as a rule, this is the theory of 7 handshakes, that is, each person is familiar with the other through a chain of 6 common acquaintances (something like this).  2) systems for the exchange, storage and processing of photos / videos received great development and popularity. <br>  I propose to create an international service based on the comparison of photos <br>  users.  It will be based on the existing theory that <br>  every person in the world has its twin.  This theory, unlike <br>  above (7 hands), <a name="habracut"></a>  often confirmed in real life. Practically every adult person at least once faces a situation when <br>  confused with someone and they say that he is very similar to someone.  If a <br>  very briefly, the following mechanism is proposed: user <br>  registered in the service and gets its page where it places <br>  (loads, maybe by mms) one or more of his photos + contact information in the desired volume + what percentage of the match he is interested in.  After pressing the button to process, he will receive a list / sketches of photos of persons with whom his face coincided with the requested or a higher percentage and which were previously placed in the database.  In the future, he will receive a notification about the appearance in the database of new persons who meet the specified conditions.  If desired, he will be able to go to the selected page and see what exactly they have in their faces, contact through the feedback mechanism with the owner of a similar ‚Äúface‚Äù.  He will also be able to assemble a collection of similar individuals and organize his own small community.  To stimulate interest, you can enter competition: users themselves will have to find very similar people in the database who have not determined the software used - for example, this must be confirmed by voting with a certain margin - the first to find this similarity will receive a prize. <br><br>  At least due to the lack of analogues, links to it and <br>  There are supposedly many comments  This is about traffic. <br><br>  Revenues can be obtained from advertising and other use of traffic.  When selling because of the current popularity of social networks, its cost will be at least sufficient for profit.

      It is probably required to conduct a small market research of demand, develop a business plan and TK.  Software meets the requirements as far as I know there, but you need to adapt it.  Creation and location of the site. <br><br>  Waiting for suggestions or comments.  The mechanism on the basis of which it is proposed to implement this project is described in detail <a href="http://ildar.3dn.ru/">here</a> .  In the same place if anyone has a desire to participate (suddenly) can leave their proposals. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/27809/">https://habr.com/ru/post/27809/</a></p>
