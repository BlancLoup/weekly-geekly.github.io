  <section class="page js-page"><h1>As before laptops did - Toshiba Libretto 50ct (1997 onwards)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It so happened that I became the owner of such a miracle: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8cd/e92/ad1/8cde92ad1b2a891352ada8a262449d86.jpg"><br>  It turned out that, despite the rather old age (laptop sample 1997), this machine is quite interesting. <br>  So, my review of Toshiba Libretto 50ct.  Continued under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h6>  Specifications </h6><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  CPU </td><td>  Intel Pentium 75MHz </td></tr><tr><td>  Bus frequency </td><td>  50 </td></tr><tr><td>  RAM </td><td>  16mb (expands to 32x) </td></tr><tr><td>  Screen </td><td>  TFT 6.1 " </td></tr><tr><td>  Screen resolution </td><td>  640x480 </td></tr><tr><td>  Graphics chip </td><td>  CT-65550 (Chips &amp; Tech) </td></tr><tr><td>  Sound card </td><td>  Yamaha OPL3 SA2 (Sound Blaster compatible) </td></tr><tr><td>  HDD </td><td>  810mb Toshiba MK-0803MAT </td></tr><tr><td>  PCMCIA </td><td>  1 slot Type II 16bit </td></tr><tr><td>  Dimensions </td><td>  210 x 115 x 34 </td></tr><tr><td>  Weight </td><td>  850 gr </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><h6>  Design </h6><br>  Length 21cm, width 12cm.  Like a little book.  I put it in my briefcase and forgot that you carry a laptop with you -) <br>  Despite such dimensions, the keyboard is quite comfortable.  Typing on it is quite realistic. <br>  Very interesting idea with a trackpad.  As you have already noticed from the photo, there is no notebook touchpad familiar to us here.  Toshiba has implemented a slightly different system.  Right on the cover you can see the joystick.  So, this joystick controls the mouse cursor.  The mouse buttons are located on the other side of the cover.  At first, such a system seems terribly inconvenient, but after 2-3 hours of work you get used to it and there are no problems with the trackpad.  As proof, I will declare that I have completed the entire Warcraft 2 campaign on this laptop =) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4a5/14b/a4e/4a514ba4e0413a95deba8831f205638f.jpg"><br>  The laptop uses a non-standard hard disk, up to 9mm.  Although at the Tsaritsyn radio market one can find a couple of such hard drives.  Insert the hard drive side with a special piece. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2d8/3d5/f21/2d83d5f217ad76594c0dbf6978d0d2b4.jpg"><br><br><h6>  Equipment </h6><br>  External floppod with PCMCIA interface was attached to the laptop.  Floppy drivers are flashed in the BIOS itself, so booting from a floppy is possible.  This device does not fit modern laptops (checked). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/627/67c/5d8/62767c5d848b9b7dab88e29ae1ca3eba.jpg"><br>  Also included is a port replicator.  Installing it on a laptop, we get additional connectors. <br>  Total on a laptop with a connected replicator we have: <br>  1 Com port <br>  1 VGA port for connecting an external monitor (maximum resolution 1280x1024 with 16 colors =) <br>  1 LPT port <br>  Infrared (!) <br>  Headphone jack. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ea1/f77/ac3/ea1f77ac3ed4d8803a4f91c58f597c8f.jpg">

    <h6>  operating system </h6><br>  The official supported system for Libretto is considered to be Windows 95. But instead of it, you can also install 98. My experience with Windows 98 on this machine is sad: it really slows down.  A 95 works great, you can even say, flies. <br>  Toshiba managed in 1997 to implement a hardware hibernate for this laptop (on a purely AT mother).  It looks like this.  After installing special drivers, an additional ‚ÄúStop‚Äù item appears in the Windows menu.  After clicking on it, the screen goes out and a rather funny picture appears on it, illustrating the process of recording the contents of the RAM on hard.  When you turn on the laptop, the exact same picture shows the progress of the reverse operation. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e6e/4d3/72e/e6e4d372ec606cbd88242da78459e8cb.jpg"><br>  I was shocked when I got to the Toshiba website and saw that the libretto is still supported and the website still contains all the drivers, utilities and FAQ. <br>  On a laptop, such things as Office, Duke 3d, Warcraft 2 and even the QT compiler are remarkably launched and work.  I have already explained to one familiar C ++ on this typewriter.  You can work. <br><br><h6>  Weak sides </h6><br>  Undoubtedly, the main problem of the laptop is the lack of USB.  In addition, there is no network card, so you will have to use a PCMCIA network card to connect to the network.  Here another problem appears: 16 bits of the PCMCIA interface.  Finding something right now for this tire is quite difficult.  Although maybe I just can not search.  I walked around the entire Tsaritsyn radio market, but there were no network cards there.  Maybe someone from habravchan prompts a place where you can find such things. <br><br><h6>  Conclusion </h6><br>  For 1997, the machine is very, very cool.  Unfortunately, nowadays it is rather difficult to find an application for it ... <br><br>  <strong>UPD:</strong> Battery <br>  At the time of writing a review of the battery in my copy of the laptop did not exist.  Thank you so much <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/aleksey_m/" class="user_link">Aleksey_M</a> for the two donated batteries. <br>  Carried out two tests: <br>  1) just kept the laptop turned on with a cleanly loaded vin95, without starting a single program - 2 hours and 20 minutes of work <br>  2) Warcraft2 =) 1 hour 40 minutes <br>  When fully discharged, it begins to squeak poisonously for about 20 seconds, after which it turns off. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/45656/">https://habr.com/ru/post/45656/</a></p>
