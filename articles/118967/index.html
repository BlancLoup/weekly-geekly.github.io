The <a href="http://wanted.vc/about/">editorial</a> project <a href="http://wanted.vc/about/">selects</a> projects for publication, these are the projects that interested Sheriff last week: <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/8793e0cb/772523cd/90bc5f65/f254d78a.png" align="left"><h5>  House supervised </h5>  Engineer Roman Skvirsky and marketer Nadezhda Revzyakova from St. Petersburg launched a video surveillance service called ‚ÄúHouse Under Supervision‚Äù, investing $ 15,000 in its creation. .

      We will not be cunning, there are many such services, but this one has unique features - simplicity and a guarantee of the safety of video recordings.  To use the ‚ÄúHouse under supervision‚Äù, a computer with Internet access and the most ordinary webcam is enough.  The video recording is saved on the remote server.  It will not disappear if the attackers climb into the house and take out the computer.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/home-under-the-care/">+++</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/127d2b69/e5f9a75c/3b13dfe5/e68de6d8.png" align="left"><h5>  Gipis </h5>  When marketer Denis Blinov and programmer Artem Ptashnik invented Gipis, they were inspired by the Nike + and Sport Tracker mobile services.  The first was launched by Nike in conjunction with Apple, the second by a team of former Nokia employees.  These services allow you to keep records of fitness workouts.  You put a mobile phone in your pocket, you run or ride a bicycle, and the device notes your route and counts calories. <br><br>  Gipis will be more complicated and promises to bring more benefits than the services of mobile giants.  Pancakes and Ptashnik offer to consider not only physical exertion, but also nutrition.  And in its paid version, Gipis will be a cheap replacement for a personal trainer.  You enter height, weight, choose, lose weight or gain weight, and the service will offer a training program and diet.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/gipis/">+++</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/01926e06/5b5dfb6e/fa85976f/c3c0a6e0.png" align="left"><h5>  Apartama </h5>  Developers Nikita Kozhemyakin, Mikhail Sychev and Ivan Semenov are preparing a revolution in the field of furniture trade.  On the website of their service Apartama, they offer users to play Sims - arrange for sofas in the interiors of typical Moscow apartments, poke a wallpaper or nail a bookshelf. <br><br>  Unlike virtual items in the Sims game, Apartama will feature real goods for home furnishings.  Visitors will be able to purchase them, and the creators of the service will earn on a percentage of sales.  Two other ways of earning money are selling licenses for creating virtual rooms on Apartama and on their own sites to furniture companies.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/apartama/">+++</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/efdeffab/096eea24/7d0cd234/ef5c89b6.png" align="left"><h5>  Helphunter </h5>  Two last year students of the Higher School of Economics, Mikhail Repnikov and Kristina Vatutina, undertook to make in Russia an analogue of the American project Redbeacon.com.  One of the creators of this service, Ethan Anderson worked on video at Google, the other - Yaron Binur led the development of Google News.  And their project suddenly turned out to be a platform that unites people who provide all kinds of personal services and those who use them.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B0-%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D1%2583%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0/">+++</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/94ab8b5f/8473e3d9/7e8d3919/7b0b2b22.jpg" align="left"><h5>  ClassicSound </h5>  Moscow photographer Pavel Tchannikov still keeps a blog about classical music, where he uploads clips, music records and stories he likes.  But in perspective, he wants to turn this blog into a social network for lovers of musical classics and the musicians themselves.  For programming, digitizing records, advertising and other needs he needs 500 thousand rubles.  In a year, promises Tchannikov, the idea will be realized.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BF-%25D1%2581-%25D0%25BC%25D1%2583%25D0%25B7%25D1%258B%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9/">+++</a> <br><br><img src="http://wanted.vc/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/crhby-ldfh-glkjguh.jpg" align="left"><h5>  Cookies </h5>  Oleg Yakovenko and Andrei Yermakov from Yekaterinburg came up with a solution for those who want to post large volumes of video on the Internet.  Now it is accepted to post videos on specialized sites such as Youtube, RuTube or Vimeo.  But the service Yakovenko and Ermakova called "Cookies" cooler.  It allows you to create your personal Youtube, to issue it as you please, and upload videos in any format - the service itself will adjust them to the desired standard.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/millions-of-cookies/">+++</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/feec7082/6e1ca4bd/ef680ce9/dd1ea15d.png" align="left"><h5>  Upiter ID </h5>  Entering a password on the keyboard and logging into Windows immediately is too easy.  At least, this is the opinion of the development team headed by the engineer and manager of the Moscow Region Korolev Oleg Bondarenko.  Therefore, in addition to the standard computer protection, they came up with a special scanner and software for it.  Not only does this scanner read fingerprints.  He also takes moisture, temperature into account, and checks for blood capillaries.  Just like in spy movies. <br><br>  With such a thing, connected to a computer via USB-port, you can not worry that someone in your absence will go into the computer and search through your documents.  And such anxiety, the creators of this product suggest, are employees of the personnel department or customer service department in any company.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0-%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D1%2587%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%2585-%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2586%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2/">+++</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/fa8cebe4/2a5a22dd/b8959764/bd976880.png" align="left"><h5>  CloudBudget </h5>  Internet service Cloudbudget is a modern replacement for Microsoft Excel when budgeting for small and medium-sized businesses.  If the company is quite small, then the good old Excel is still here and there, but if it has several offices, it is no longer good, and not solid. <br><br>  The next step after Excel for entrepreneurs, as a rule, becomes an ERP-system, but it is difficult to install and contain it.  And Cloudbudget is simple in business and is not installed on computers, and is, as is now fashionable, on the Internet.  You can not worry about the safety and confidentiality of the data - they are located on the servers of the company Salesforce.  It provides many remote applications and has proven itself in the US market, where the Cloudbudget team is aiming.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D1%2587%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9-%25D0%25B1%25D1%258E%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582/">+++</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/856795a0/4f0e0f3b/73775d99/f83af9bd.png" align="left"><h5>  Kidbox </h5>  The creator of "Vkontakte" Pavel Durov, in response to the claims of the public that children, they say, place pornography in his network, replied something like this: educate your children better!  For the KidBox project team this phrase is a guide to action.  Startups create an interactive children's world online, like ‚ÄúSmeshariki‚Äù, but with elements of education. <br><br>  The sheriff knows from his own experience: services for children are a bonanza.  For two text messages sent by the child from your cell phone, Smesharik will cost 2 thousand rubles.  And if you gape, the child will send a third text message.  KidBox wants to be more merciful to parents.  Fee for childish pranks will be less.  At the same time, children will not just play, but also learn, for example, the multiplication table.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/education-reform/">+++</a> <br><br>  PS If you heard about interesting projects, write to us - startup@wanted.vc - and we will write about them! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/118967/">https://habr.com/ru/post/118967/</a></p>
