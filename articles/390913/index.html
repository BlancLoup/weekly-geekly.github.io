Not even, perhaps.  There are competent experts about whom there is already enough information on the network.  But who also need new projects. <br><br>  And so, many development specialists come to just tons of spam from hr-managers who promise mountains of wealth, interesting projects and crazy prospects.

      I will try to make out the situation in the course of the historical following events.  And I will give remarks immediately. <br><br>  I cite a fictional case, but I think that many will see something familiar in it. <br><br>  So, you are a specialist with experience of more than 5 years.  You have experience in different companies, including large and famous ones.  You also have a decent portfolio of unbanal works.  Online have your publications.  For example, about development, about different projects, etc. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  You receive a message from the hr-manager, who begins to tell you that he found you on the network, you are a tough specialist and are very necessary in a project, some large company.  Very often some kind of incomprehensible company is called.  But to your question who they are, they can tell you that this company is developing for, for example, Samsung and other giants. <br><br>  Get information about wages and conditions is not possible.  You are told that you yourself must write the desired salary and conditions.  The company will consider them.  When you ask if they can pay me so much so that I don‚Äôt waste my time, they will tell you that it‚Äôs no problem.  It fits into their budget. <br><br>  The only thing you need to do is send your resume, and also, very often - to perform a test task.  When asked what kind of nonsense, I‚Äôm a well-known specialist with a large number of complex projects in the background, what in FIG is the test task for the middle ones?  You answer that it is not they who decide, they say it is necessary. <br><br>  Events can develop further in two ways. <br><br>  First, the hr-manager just disappears for a few weeks, feeds you with some kind of breakfast.  And when you press it, it will say that you are not suitable.  When asked why, they will say that either you want too much money, you have already taken someone else, or he is not at all aware of the reason. <br><br>  The second option is that you can be invited for an interview.  Or to the office (if the same city), or via Skype.  Speak you will not quite understand with whom.  This may be another specialist from the company, maybe some kind of secretary, or they may not even introduce themselves.  But it will not be the one who makes the decisions.  And this is the main point.  You will begin to ask some more often stupid questions that may not concern your topic at all.  On your question, whether your works looked, read your articles and publications, more often they will answer no.  They say it makes no sense, we now communicate. <br><br>  It ends with the fact that you are told that you are a very cool specialist, they are all satisfied.  But the decision is not made by them, but by the bosses from above.  Like they call you.  As a result, you are not called for a whole month, and you begin to pull the hr-manager, whom you begin to hate quietly.  He informs you that: either you want a lot of money, or have already taken another, or you have been refused, but you have not given any reasons. <br><br>  Further, having passed several such "interviews", you already simply hide any hr-manager, and send to hell, without even going into the essence. <br><br>  I think that the picture is familiar to many.  And everyone became the participant of such show. <br><br>  Why is all this happening and what problems I see. <br><br>  As a rule, hr-managers are young people, if not young ones.  They are not able to assess a person from a professional point of view or from a psychological one.  In the overwhelming number of cases, such people receive remuneration from the found specialist, in the amount of one salary per month, which the found specialist will receive. <br><br>  This is problem number one. <br><br>  1) HR-manager does not solve your employment problem.  Also, he does not solve the problem of the company in finding a qualified specialist.  He solves his personal problem - ‚Äúmaking‚Äù money.  He cannot appreciate you as a specialist, and he does not want either.  The most important thing is to get a resume from you.  Also, he cannot and does not want to solve the problem of the company.  The most important thing is to transfer your resume to the company.  If he shoots - cool, he broke the bank.  If you do not shoot, then you need to redouble efforts to send spam. <br><br>  Here I see a number of other problems.  Where does the confidential information of specialists go?  What is being done with it and where can it later emerge?  An aimless loss of time by a specialist, as well as getting extra stress. <br><br>  2) HR-manager is not responsible for anything.  If the company is scammed and does not pay a salary, this is not his problem.  If the specialist turns out to be fake, then there is no demand from the HR manager.  They say the company itself conducted an interview, I have nothing to do with it. <br><br>  3) Complete destruction of confidence in the labor market in general, in companies and professionals in particular. <br><br>  4) Creating a fake bubble in the labor market and in specific areas.  Fake bloated salaries and fake vacancies completely distort the understanding of the real picture of the market. <br><br>  5) Such a state of affairs in the labor market leads to the fact that intelligent experts begin to look for clients for themselves and open their own small business.  Success or not, that is another question.  But at the same time, large companies can not staff their staff with highly qualified personnel.  There is a turnover of personnel and the decline of the area, in our particular case - the IT area. <br><br>  As a result, having understood this problem a little, it becomes more or less clear where all this goes and what it will lead to. <br><br>  As I see the solution to this problem.  I see only two paths. <br><br>  1. This is each company employer, independently searches for specialists.  It gives the selection criteria and technical requirements.  She conducts an interview.  Accordingly, she herself is responsible for her selection and attitude to this issue. <br><br>  Sometimes you read the ad from HR-managers, with the requirements for the applicant, and you do not understand whether these people are in their minds or not. <br><br>  2. Create a normal and human labor market by licensing the work of HR companies.  Only specialists with experience in a particular field can make a primary selection of the applicant.  Undertake commitments to conduct a quality interview, removing the need for companies.  To enter in the general database of the applicant, his capabilities and merits.  So that the next time he doesn‚Äôt have to go through all these silly and useless procedures again from scratch.  And if a company that needs a specialist delegates the authority to select the personnel of an HR company, then it is obliged by contract to rely on such a choice.  And do not conduct an interview again.  Otherwise, it makes no sense to trust the selection to someone, and you need to do the selection of the staff yourself.  Any problem situations should be resolved by an HR company and bear full responsibility for their actions or inactions. <br><br>  Unfortunately, I do not think that a solution to the problem I wrote about can occur in the CIS countries.  But I will hope that, nevertheless, sometime there will be restoring order in the labor market, and everything will become transparent and understandable. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/390913/">https://habr.com/ru/post/390913/</a></p>
