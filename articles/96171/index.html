  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Employment Experience in Norway: Interview</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Continuing the topic of employment in Norway. <br>  So, after some waiting, the desired happened - you got a call and was invited to an interview.  Many Norwegians say - such an invitation, this is already very much - more than half.  It is all explained simply - it is more difficult for Norway to write an attractive statement than to go for an interview. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I know from my practice that writing is not easy.  I wrote about a dozen different letters of application before they began to work and began to invite me.  There are many pitfalls in the statements.  It is necessary to avoid stereotypes.  This is when you write one letter and then just change the addressee, the letter should be addressed to exactly the company where you arrange.  One should try to reinforce any statement about oneself with the experience mentioned in the resume.  Try not to write a dry letter, but at the same time - the letter should be informative. <br><br>  And so, the application passed, and you got a call.  If the agreement occurs by phone, then you need to answer immediately - when it is convenient for you.  If the agreement is by email, then it‚Äôs easy to lose the interview.  In any case, it happened to me once.  I was asked if I could come then, I said that I could not do it, but I can happily come at another time.  They no longer talked with me (although by Norwegian standards this is rather rude).  And once the interview almost fell through (again, communication was offline).  I realized in time and changed other arrangements for a specified time.  When they agree on the phone, there is a chance to quickly find a convenient time for both parties.  As a rule, an invitation after an agreement with you is duplicated by email.  They write - where, when, and who will be at the interview.  Details may also be mentioned (for example, there will be professional testing).  From this point on you need to start preparing for the interview.  Usually the interview takes half an hour - an hour.  Teachers from recruitment courses like to say that they can start observing you from the moment you entered the building.  In fact, it happens simply.  Many companies have a camera at the entrance.  You press the call to the office, the employee in the reception receives your picture.  She will then offer you a coffee and make you sit down, wait for the person who invited you.  By the way speaking, it is better not to refuse coffee.  This is your social skill - to be open.  In other companies, the employee at the reception desk is replaced with a computer, where you need to enter information about yourself and to whom you are going.  The computer prints a sticker - a pass, in between times, can make your photo as a keepsake (this will all come in the notice of the visitor to the one who called you).  As far as I know, here in companies it is not customary to arrange a stress interview.  Ie, all the interview is quite soft, without sharp moments.  Can ask anything.  But some questions are illegal and they prefer to avoid them.  And accordingly, the candidates are also not desirable to mention them.  The questions are simple: religion, orientation, political views.  There are more questions about age and marital status in the law, but Norwegians themselves usually indicate this information in the summary.  True, the question of whether you are going to have a child is also not legitimate. <br>  You need to know your positive qualities.  There is a typical Russian habit - try to seem perfect.  For example, each programmer considers it his duty to be able to manage a project.  It is important to know your place.  Not so bad to be able to perform quality routine work.  It is appreciated.  They do not always understand how a java programmer can be a system administrator.  Of course, this may be so, but why it happened it is necessary to be able to explain.  A programmer or administrator is a profession.  One profession may come instead of another, if this other did not like.  But if she didn‚Äôt like her, then why apply for her?  This, by the way, is not my opinion.  Again, the information from the course. <br>  Your application will be read carefully and in advance.  Important places will be marked and asked.  As a rule, while there is a conversation with you, one of the interviewers makes notes for himself. <br><br>  There are fairly standard questions that I consider, to my mind, quite interesting: <br><ul><li>  <b>What will your friends say about you?</b> <br>  Here it is important not to overdo it.  No need to be perfect, try to describe yourself as it is. <br></li><li>  <b>What conflict situations have you been in?</b> <br>  This is a very serious question.  He is paid a lot of attention on courses, and the employer pays a lot of attention.  A conflict that can be told about should have a cause, a development, and how you were able to resolve the situation.  You don‚Äôt need to be a hero, you just need to tell a high-quality story. <br></li><li>  <b>How long are you going to stay in this position?</b> <br>  Again, intervening people are managers with experience.  They sign not only applications for admission, but also applications for satisfaction.  They know how many people usually work in one place.  In the IT industry, the average period of work in one place is 5 years.  Many people change jobs to raise salaries.  Unsuspecting minimum for IT is 2 years.  Ie, 2 years in one place is not considered a little.  Do not expect that they will believe that you are going to work there until retirement.  We must try to show the seriousness of intentions, while not falling into a puddle.  If you have not worked or when more than 4 years in one place, it is ridiculous to say that you are going to work at this place 8. <br></li><li>  <b>The question of salary.</b> <br>  Usually, the question is asked after the job is offered.  But lately, for IT entry-level rates, this question is asked at the center of the interview.  The question is complicated.  At the preparatory courses for the interview they say that you need to answer something like this - like "As much as you pay to other specialists of my level."  Of the 7 interviews that I completed for 3, I received the following question: ‚Äúwhat do you think, how much should a specialist of your level get?‚Äù  It is also necessary to be able to operate with numbers.  You can demand something that you had plus something else.  But often, then - what was mentioned is not always beneficial, as it can significantly reduce the proposal.  In this case, there are statistics on graduates of technical specialties of the society Tekna: <a href="http://tekna.no/lonn">tekna.no/lonn</a> .  You can take a number from there and refer to it. <br></li><li>  There may be a <b>question about problems in a diploma</b> (low marks for a diploma), or in a resume (for example, inactivity gaps).  As I said before, explanations related to family circumstances are good explanations. <br></li></ul><br>  At the interview it is better not to talk about bad bosses.  We must try to avoid the negative assessments of other people, even though I know from myself, from Russia dragging such a heap of undesirable experience that it is very difficult to forget and avoid talking about it. <br>  At the end of the interview will be asked to ask questions to them.  There are some issues that recruits in IT are not very fond of.  For example - the issue of vacation, flexible hours and overtime.  Vacation is a standard matter.  In addition to various kinds of summer vacations, there is the concept of ‚Äúgeneral vacations‚Äù.  At this time there is almost no one working.  This time no one will take it away, unless they hire you to shut up someone else‚Äôs absence at this particular time.  Almost everyone has a flexible schedule and accounting for overtime.  But when asked about this question, as I noted, the interviewer darkens a little.  The concept of "home office" is widespread.  It‚Äôs better not to ask for an interview either (unless of course this is a vital necessity).  It is necessary to try to avoid questions, answers to which you could learn from well-known sources. <br>  After the questions, you are usually informed what steps can be taken next. <br>  For example, if you are a current candidate - the second interview.  If you are not told how long to wait for the result, then you need to ask about it.  Further, the interviewer takes you to the door of the restaurant and says goodbye.  All that remains is to wait for their call.  If you have not called - you can call back in a week from the deadline and ask.  But, in my experience, if interesting, then call back in time. </div>
