  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Android 3.0 Gingerbread, thoughts</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/11d/8a3/8a6/11d8a38a6f01c4ed3bbe1f71c9b15b08.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Some devices have not had time to see on board the version of Android 2.1, not to mention the newly released 2.2, as there was a more or less specific info about Android 3.0 Gingerbread.  I have carefully studied the information about this version of Android and will gladly share my thoughts on this topic. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  More recently, I had a completely ambivalent opinion and impressions about such a frequent update of Android versions.  Some devices are still being sold with version 1.5, and after it, 1.6, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2 have already appeared and in mid-October (approximately 15-16 numbers) of 2010 will be presented to us 3.0.  On the one hand, the updates (which are really cool) are good, it is clear that the OS is not marking time.  It‚Äôs fraught with bad consequences on the spot, even the Bible says about it: ‚ÄúWhoever is worth, beware so as not to fall,‚Äù and also ‚ÄúUnder a rolling stone, water does not flow.‚Äù  An example of today's time is Symbian OS.  Once, information about any other operating system was perceived as a joke - there is a great Symbian!  This OS has long been the market leader among mobile operating systems, it is now.  However, for quite a long time, Symbian moves not in steps, but in small steps.  As a consequence, there is a loss of interest from software makers, a loss of market share, and already today there are all the prerequisites for changing the leader in the mobile OS market towards the OS from the search giant. <br><br>  Such frequent updates of Android versions of some (including me) were a bit alarming, because software in many cases is not compatible with earlier versions - this is the time;  you can wait for the update for your device for a very long time - these are two (remember the HTC Hero).  However, the first point would have disappeared by itself, with the possibility of a quick update of any device running Android OS.  What does that require?  It is necessary to get rid of all third-party visual shells, like Sense from HTC.  They are the brakes for a quick update - every new version needs to be adjusted to the interface.  Why do we need interfaces?  The fact is that until recently Google put all its efforts into the technical part of its mobile OS, and the interface today is not very convenient for many important functions of the device, including calls.  Accordingly, the manufacturers of the devices tried to finish the cool OS for convenient use.  And, frankly, this confusion pushed me away.  ‚ÄúI'll wait for the version of Android 7.1 in 2015, then I will buy a device with this OS‚Äù - I thought.  But Google turned out to be smarter than me, starting from version 3.0 there will be no need for third-party shells, in this version the UI will be completely refined.  What does this give us?  Absolutely everything that I wanted was an instant update of the OS versions when it officially appeared.  It will come out 3.1 and you do not have to wait half a year to be able to upgrade your ancient 3.0.  By the way, the updates themselves will also appear much more restrained - no more than once every six months.

      There are also limitations of the new version of Android, which will leave afloat versions 2.1 and 2.2, namely, demands on the hardware.  Upgrade to Gingerbread can only devices with a minimum processor frequency of 1 GHz, with at least 512 MB of RAM and a display diagonal of at least 3.5 ‚Ä≥.  Weaker models will support upgrades to a maximum of version 2.2.  By the way, for displays with a diagonal of 4 inches and above, the screen resolution will be 1280 √ó 760, today the Android supports the maximum resolution of 854x480 pixels. <br>  This is undoubtedly a very important and wise step of developers, which will remove most of the barriers to the transition to the new OS for those who want to use one device for a long time while maintaining its software relevance. <br><br>  UPD.  Most likely, the version will be with an index of 2.3, not 3.0.  Thanks for commenting! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/98077/">https://habr.com/ru/post/98077/</a></p>
