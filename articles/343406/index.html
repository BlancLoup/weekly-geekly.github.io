      If an employee of Ultimate Guitar is woken up in the middle of the night and asked what characteristic he / she will give to his supervisor, then the answer will be one: ‚ÄúYes, he is turned on a multiple of height‚Äù.  For Mikhail Trutnev there will be no better compliment. <br><br>  Mikhail Trutnev calls himself and his team abnormal: "We are focused on only one thing: on a multiple growth."  Much of what these guys do is of interest and emotion: ‚ÄúCome on!  Seriously?".  The company is all saturated with efficiency.  Perhaps this is the reason for such success on the world stage. <br><br>  Rituals and a kind of inner culture help to achieve maximum results and effectiveness of the rock and roll team.  Rituals and culture is the foundation on which the strategic goals of the # 1 service for musicians are based. <br><br>  The main engines of efficiency and growth from CEO Ultimate Guitar: <br><br><ul><li>  Rituals </li><li>  People and team </li><li>  Head behavior </li></ul><br><h2>  Rituals <br></h2><br>  There is a special ritual in UG - a pitch from employees.  The office created a special platform for the public expression of ideas for the development and growth of profits in the company.  Every Tuesday morning at 10:00 a brainstorm.  Pitching is not a right, but the responsibility of every Ultimate Guitar employee. <br><br>  It is interesting that not only developers, marketers, designers, but also waitress girls who cook breakfast in the office every morning (by the way, one more ritual) participate in the pitches.  Together with the others, they come out on the pitch, offering their ideas, for example, to create cocktails against viruses and colds, having calculated how much a company will lack for employees due to illness. <br><br>  <b>A quality idea contains:</b> <b><br></b> <br><ol><li>  How much money we earn for the idea.  This criterion sweeps aside half of the ideas at the design stage. </li><li>  Arguing why this works (case studies or experiences from other companies). </li><li>  The experiment itself.  How can you quickly, accurately and cheaply check. </li></ol><br>  Of course, not everything was perfect right away.  It is difficult for people in general to dare and express their ideas in public.  At the first stage, most ideas were just about anything. <br><br>  In order to overcome the fear of failure, the UG excluded punishment in any form.  Cash remuneration does not depend on the results of work.  Also hired a coach who taught how to pitch.  It sped up the process and providing quality ideas.  All the conditions were created that charged the employees with the desire to try new things, enter into the spirit and offer only "thick ideas". <br><br><h2>  People <br></h2><br>  There were also "assholes" in the company who spread the ideas put forward, thereby demotivating other employees to come forward again.  Therefore, the UG decided to part with such people.  The selection of the Ultimate Guitar team is very thorough.  Mikhail Trutnev introduced the practice of parting with "troeshnikami", which pull the team down.  The team must work exclusively the best people. <br><br>  At school, teachers spend 80% of their time on troechnik.  Excellent students do it themselves.  The same with the team: the best workers (honors students) spend 80% of the time pulling up the middle peasants (troechnik), this reduces the efficiency by several times.  Today, the team UG only abnormal the best of the best. <br><br><h2>  Speed <br></h2><br>  There are no extra professions in UG, tasks are solved in small teams.  The larger the team, the more time for communication, and therefore less time for work.  Rarely, when the Ultimate Guitar grocery team is more than two people. <br><br>  The working day in the company - from 9:00 to 15:00.  At the same time, the company works six days a week: Monday - Saturday.  Why?  To work more productively and have a free evening every day. <br><br>  The team works in openspace, where the transfer of information does not require time-consuming;  Online chat rooms, services for corporate communication and planning - all this is not about them. <br><br><h2>  Heads rotated on multiple growth <br></h2><br>  The basic principle of the leader focused on growth: the selection of employees.  This is the direct responsibility of the founder, not HR.  The CEO and CMO have set themselves a business task: they must work only the best people.  And moving in this direction daily. <br><br>  Another principle of the head, turned on the growth: work with the team honestly - caring for people and exceptional exactingness perfectly coexist. <br><br>  Trust your team, but do not forget to control it.  Control and trust are not antipodes, and this is important to understand. <br><br>  Performing team tasks raises the team spirit.  And no corporate trips, kayaking, will bring your employees closer together, as the execution of team tasks does. <br><br>  And the last principle: Intrigue.  Return day is impossible.  And to lose - easily.  Therefore, every day, consider how intrigue, challenge, the opportunity to do something useful that will bring growth and profit of the company.  You can not lose a single day. <br>  And farewell: do not feel sorry for yourself, do not feel sorry for the team.  Make an informed choice for what you think is important, and be happy.  This is rock and roll. <br><br>  Subscribe to our Habra blog and the <a href="https://t.me/epicgrowth">Epic Growth Channel channel</a> in the Telegram, read useful content on grocery marketing. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/343406/">https://habr.com/ru/post/343406/</a></p>
