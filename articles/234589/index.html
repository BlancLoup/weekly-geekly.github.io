      <b>iPhone 6</b> <br>  No matter how many of us are related to the products of the apple company (ranging from blind hatred to fierce love), in September most will be talking about the new iPhone. <br><br>  Apple noticeably updates its models every two years, so this September, most expect to see the iPhone grow diagonally.  It is assumed that there will be not only the iPhone 6 with a diagonal of 4.7 inches, but also a certain iPhone 6L, with a diagonal of 5.5 inches.  A sort of late response to wide-diagonal devices on Android. <br><br>  This is how the new device should look compared to the current model (white stripes are somewhat surprising, but fans say they will be covered in the release): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a82/1bb/66b/a821bb66b7ee49609853640c7ee2d27e.jpg"><br><br>  So, according to the render, all three models are in front: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dcb/f05/702/dcbf05702fbc4a418bed20689b49a6bc.jpg"><br><br>  But this <a href="http://www.bgr.in/news/fully-assembled-iphone-6-finally-leaked-ahead-of-september-9-launch/">should</a> look like a fully finished phone assembly (strips in place): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f3b/48c/edf/f3b48cedf8da4ca49c4d2fa6daab46d7.jpg"><br><br>  From the unusual: it is expected that the new iPhone will be equipped with a sapphire crystal.  In the network there is an interesting video, where an inquisitive young man tries to scratch the screen with a knife.  Unsuccessfully. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/5R0_FJ4r73s%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhg4Ln6Mszmh3yzaXF-OMs3v1VgYeQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  True, the opposite side of the protection may be worse <a href="http://www.computerra.ru/102984/sapphire-glass-vs-gorilla/">light transmission</a> , which means that the display will require a stronger backlight, and the phone will require more frequent charging.  Moreover, they say that precisely because of the problems with highlighting the presentation may be delayed. <br><br>  In addition, many hope that Apple will introduce a two-way USB cable that can be plugged into existing ports by either side.  Hallelujah <br><br>  Otherwise, everything is more or less predictable: the new A8 processor, the new iOS8, the improved camera.  Expected date of presentation: September 9, i.e.  exactly two weeks later.  True, Apple has not yet sent invitations, and another possible date could be October 14th. <br><br>  <b>Samsung</b> <br>  In anticipation of the release of the iPhone 6, the sworn friend from South Korea begins his own game.  First of all, Samsung is launching a video in which the new diagonal of the iPhone is mocked.  Like, guys, big phones have been around for a long time. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/QSDAjwKI8Wo&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjNBGcqJ1-p22j4QvhPGZ6ECxBQfA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Secondly, in September, Samsung plans to launch sales of its new Samsung Galaxy Alpha phone.  Of the main features of the device, the manufacturer notes that ta-dam, aluminum frame. <br><br>  Otherwise, this one, apart from the jokes, is really a beautiful device, for some reason it easily loses in performance to last year‚Äôs smartphones.  Including from the same Samsung.  Especially depressing battery - only 1860 mA ‚Ä¢ h.  The joyous reaction of the habrasoobshchestva to this device can be found <a href="https://sohabr.ru/post/233741/">here.</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/715/cd2/c2b/715cd2c2bd64492c9ffbc83d988ce1a2.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Therefore, all potential owners of Galaxy Alpha will find another new September very useful - external batteries that are 100% charged in just 15 minutes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e71/3a4/eeb/e713a4eeb824429cbc260766050a90f8.jpg"><br><br>  Uni Company <a href="http://www.gizmag.com/petalite-ultrapack-external-phone-15-minutes/33227/">announced the</a> release in September of two new models of external batteries.  It is claimed that the younger Petalite Flux model with a capacity of 2600 mAh and a weight of 95 grams will be 100% charged in just 15 minutes.  And the oldest, Ultrapack Go, with a capacity of 3000 mAh, in half an hour.  Moreover, at 2/3 capacity (i.e. at 2000 mAh) will be ‚Äúhammered‚Äù in the same 15 minutes. <br><br>  First, Ultrapack Go will go on sale (pre-order price: <a href="http://www.myunu.com/ultrapak-go-battery-pack.html">$ 59.99</a> , then 79.99), and then Petalite Flux (price not yet announced).  Interestingly, a small Petalite Flux will come with its own charger, because, according to the developers, ‚Äúto push the current of such power through a standard USB port would mean burning it in a couple of seconds.‚Äù <br><br>  Back in September - the conference on September 4 - <a href="http://gizmodo.com/here-are-the-first-images-of-the-moto-x-1-1625397605">the</a> presentation of the Motorola X + 1 is <a href="http://gizmodo.com/here-are-the-first-images-of-the-moto-x-1-1625397605">expected</a> - a phone capable of becoming more than a decent competitor to the current market leaders.  But there may be <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/230137/">problems</a> with its import to Russia, so it will not dwell on it in detail. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5d1/a03/49e/5d1a0349e27042a0a4a935771b076c1f.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Clock</b> <br><br>  In addition to phones, September promises to be interesting in terms of hours.  First, it is expected the start of sales of the long-awaited Moto 360. Apparently, this will be the first beautiful smart watch ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/madrobots/blog/227801/">Withings Activite is</a> not considered - because it refers to the "smart" is very conditional).  A large round display, sapphire glass, work on Android Wear and a bunch of Google Now, beautiful desktop charging - all together it promises to make the Moto 360 more than enjoyable to use.  Expected price - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/233627/">$ 250</a> .  Of the obvious flaws - an unpleasant black stripe at the very bottom of the dial.  But it is easy to survive. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5e6/c7b/538/5e6c7b53893f433b82f4efeb28455b48.jpg"><br><br>  Secondly, in September (or October, the sources disagree here), there could be a presentation of not less long-awaited iWatch.  According to rumors, they will also be protected by sapphire glass and come in two versions: male - with a larger dial, and female - with a smaller one.  Interestingly, for the promotion of a new product, Apple lured away the former sales director from the famous watch company Tag Heuer.  Neither the price nor the capabilities of iWatch are yet known. <br><br>  Third, the current manufacturer of one of the most convenient smart watches on the market, Sony, has promised to release a third version of its SmartWatch in September.  It is noteworthy that Sony is rumored to be tied up with Android and release the clock on some of its platform.  Earlier, Samsung jumped from Android, sending the Tizen operating system to the Gear in its next update.  By the way, this moment is generally very interesting - you buy watches on Android, and one fine day, just by downloading the update, you discover that you already live on another operating system.  And tomorrow, you see, Ubuntu will arrive, and then some <a href="http://wp7forum.ru/sluxi-microsoft-rabotaet-nad-umnymi-chasami/">Windows Watch</a> . <br><br>  By the way, another funny fact from the life of ‚Äúsmart watches‚Äù: LG, the manufacturer of current Android Wear watches LG G Watch, released a patch that removes voltage from charging contacts.  It turned out that after the user put the watch on his wrist, the watch still applied current to the contacts.  As a result, some owners complained of irritation and discomfort.  Now it is already removed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a4e/033/9ca/a4e0339cafaa411ca9340381b7bb9d32.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Back in September (specifically on the 30th), they promise to show the new Widows 9, codenamed Threshhold, where they will return the start button.  Some more virtual desktops (hello, Linux) and voice assistant Cortana (hello, Siri) are expected.  There are no other significant rumors about the new OS. <br><br>  Well, the last thing, but for me personally, much more than all of the above - in September, sales of such a Lego designer will start :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/776/876/a93/776876a937d5455faa360664bea48487.jpg"><br><br>  <a href="http://shop.lego.com/en-US/VIP-Early-Access-76023">Lego Batman Tumbler</a> - Lego-copy of the Betmobile from Nolan movies.  1869 parts, sizes: 38x23 centimeters, price - only $ 200 (currently the set is available for a limited number of regular Lego customers, but you can buy it on Amazon and Ebay for about $ 260- $ 320).  There are two options available - with a figure of Batman or Joker in the kit.  So I have already set aside the money. <br><br>  That's all for today.
