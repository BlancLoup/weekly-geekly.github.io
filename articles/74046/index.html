The project presents apartments in 25 cities that can be booked online. <br><br>  Probably all of you have seen ads and sites where they offer to rent an apartment or even for a few hours.  For what apartment for ‚Äúa few hours‚Äù I hope it is clear to everyone, but here‚Äôs what rent for a day and who knows much less people knows.  So, the main clients are Russian and foreign tourists, people who go on business trips or on vacation.  This may be a group of friends who are traveling for a weekend to St. Petersburg or Kiev or the conference participants, or even those who are visiting, but do not want to embarrass their acquaintances.

      <b>Why apartments, and not hotels?</b> <br>  Apartments are chosen for a number of reasons: <br>  1. First and foremost is the price.  The price of apartments is lower than the prices of hotels, although everything depends on the season and the availability of discounts in hotels.  In our hotels, unfortunately, good quality costs very ‚Äúgood‚Äù money, and an apartment with the same ‚Äúrepair‚Äù and furniture can always be found. <br>  2. As I said apartments can be rented by the company.  I myself actively use the rent, for example, in 2008 we went to Kiev on Blogcamp.  The three of them took a dvushku in the city center.  Comfortable and not expensive. <br>  3. The apartments have kitchens and bathtubs with washing machines - you can save on cooking and washing things.  In hotels, this can not be done. <br>  4. Apartments are much more private than hotels, and it‚Äôs no secret that many rent apartments to hold a meeting or a series of meetings: P <br>  5. Usually apartments are located in the center.  If you come as a tourist to explore the city and want to save money, then you can choose a cheap hotel far from the center or an apartment in the center.! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  By the way, rent an apartment for a day to roll a cool party in it will not work.  Landlords try to make the apartment look good after each client. <br><br>  General Council, when you need to rent an apartment, and when the hotel, I unfortunately can not say.  Here it is necessary to consider each specific situation.  So, for example, you have rented a room, and a friend has come to visit you, you cannot share it for free, and if you are in an apartment, you can.  On the other hand, if you have money, you can always rent an additional hotel room. <br><br>  <b>Not only advantages</b> <br>  In addition to the advantages of apartments there are a number of obvious drawbacks.  In Russia, the daily rental market is still wild, there are many private owners, agencies and companies, as there are no bona fide ones.  You can order one apartment, and get to another.  Or, for example, photos on the site in general will show the repair of an apartment two years ago.  Here you need to be vigilant and attentive when choosing a landlord, just like when choosing a hotel - you can always pay a lot, and run into the "garbage". <br><br>  Now a little more about the project Welcome-to-russia.ru. <br><br>  <b>Emphasis on quality</b> <br>  On our project, the client can book an apartment online, as well as hotels, and be sure that on arrival he will be settled exactly in the apartment he has ordered.  Namely, booking apartments online is a distinctive feature of a number of similar projects.  Unfortunately, the organization of the possibility to book online over 600 apartments (their number continues to grow) is associated with the emergence of a number of problems. <br><br>  If you go to the project site, you will see that prices are not as low as we would like.  All for the simple reason that we primarily focus on the quality of service.  But, in the future, prices will decrease as we actively increase the number of our apartments.  If you rent an apartment, you can find out the details <a href="http://www.welcome-to-russia.ru/forowners.aspx">here</a> . <br><br>  <b>Objective of the project</b> <br>  The aim of the project is to make daily rent of apartments a full-fledged niche of tourism, organized and interesting business.  I will be glad to any help, advice and other support. <br><br>  <b>To partners</b> <br>  All those who are engaged in reselling travel services, such as hotel reservations, airline tickets will be interested in a reseller program from Welcome-to-rusia.ru.  More details about it can be found in the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/welcometorussia/apartment-rental-service%3Fsrc%3Dembed">presentation</a> . <br><br>  PS Although the project is already several years old, I consider it possible to call it a startup, since now it has begun to actively develop. <br><br>  PPS If it will be interesting, I will publish articles on how to choose an apartment for a day, and also to avoid major mistakes when choosing, as well as how to solve problems with the landlord on the spot. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/74046/">https://habr.com/ru/post/74046/</a></p>
