The delivery date of the devices to the stores of the apple company, as expected, is September of the current year.  According to <a href="http://www.electronista.com/articles/11/07/05/pegatron.lands.big.deal.with.apple.for.iphone.5/">numerous</a> <a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20110704PD216.html">sources</a> , the new smartphone model will not be much different from the 4th generation. <br><br>  Order numbers are interestingly correlated with the historical increase in sales (and production) of the iPhone worldwide.  A million models of the first generation were sold a month after the start of sales.  Today, Apple supplies to its stores, and various operators, tens of millions of devices - for example, in the first quarter of this year they sold 16.24 million, and in the second - 18.65 million. The dynamics are obvious.

      Actually, Pegatron itself rebuilt its factory in order to satisfy the gigantic appetite of fans of Apple products, but so far it has not been able to reach the promised level - it had to deliver 10 million iPhone 4 by now, however, it has fulfilled only 40% of the order. <br><br>  According to reports from various media resources from all over the Internet, the new iPhone model will not be different from the 4th generation, however some changes will take place inside the phone: a new processor (dual-core A5), a new camera (8 MP), a new screen ( which will be positioned from edge to edge of the device, presumably 3.7 "or 3.8-inch with a resolution a third more than the iPad 2). In addition to all this, Verizon recently suggested that the new iPhone might work in networks of two standards: CDMA and GSM. However, it is possible that such a function will have  Only the device supplied by this operator. <br><br>  From these pleasant announcements, let us return to the topic of publication, namely, the long stretching conflict between two giant companies: Apple itself and Samsung, about which Habrahabr readers are <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/patent/117745/">probably</a> aware of. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Instead of dancing with a tambourine <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/patent/122212/">around this problem</a> , Apple is trying to prizhuchit its competitor a powerful blow from the existing set.  Specifically, the company filed a request for a preliminary injunction on sales of Samsung‚Äôs four ‚Äúhottest‚Äù products: Infuse 4G, Galaxy S 4G, Droid Charge and Galaxy Tab 10.1 <br><br>  The tone to which the request to the court is written, makes it clear that the company is ready to win or lose in a big way: ‚ÄúThe message that Samsung sends to its consumers in a simulated smartphone ad is simple:‚Äú It's just like an iPhone ‚Äù(Same as iPhone).  The Samsung Galaxy 10.1 tablet sends roughly similar text to a potential buyer: ‚ÄúIt's just like an iPad‚Äù (Same as iPad). ‚Äù <br><br>  If the judge satisfies Apple‚Äôs request, Samsung will have exactly two months to remove the four devices from stores throughout the US.  According to many observers, this is a very serious step and the strongest motivation to finally figure out and determine who is right and who is to blame for this long-running dispute. <br><br>  However, Samsung can make a stony face and he has every reason to do so.  If the judge does not satisfy Apple‚Äôs request, the following will occur: <br><br>  <b>A.</b>  Apple‚Äôs reputation as a company that is judged absolutely with all imitators has already tired not only judges and competitors, but also the public who remain loyal to competitive products.  In this case, the owners of Samsung equipment. <br><br>  <b>B.</b>  Since America has a case law, this action will add a serious psychological effect to all current and future Apple litigation with anyone. <br><br>  Considering the fact that Apple has not even shown a prototype, and even more so a ready-made working apparatus of the next generation, this request to the court looks, as it were correctly put it, ‚Äúfar-reaching‚Äù, since the ban on sales of Samsung devices in the US (which, by the way , are the direct competitors of the iPhone 5) - this is an overly harsh reaction to the, in general, ordinary patent dispute.  Judge Lucy Koch (Lucy Koh) most likely thinks the same, although it was she who rejected Samsung's lawyers' request to show prototypes of the iPhone 5 and iPad 3 in order to avoid an escalation of the conflict, on which hordes of lawyers from both sides are currently working. <br><br>  Starting today, we are likely to observe a sharp verbal skirmish between Apple and Samsung until the court has put an end to this dispute.  On August 5, a hearing on this case will begin, and it is then that Apple hopes to succeed in the fight against Samsung. <br><br>  <a href="http://fosspatents.blogspot.com/2011/07/apple-files-motion-for-preliminary.html">Fosspatents</a> via <a href="http://www.mobilecrunch.com/2011/07/05/apple-tries-to-get-rid-of-samsung-copycats-once-and-for-all/">TechCrunch</a> via <a href="">ArsTechnica</a> via <a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20110704PD216.html">Digitimes</a> via <a href="http://www.electronista.com/articles/11/07/05/pegatron.lands.big.deal.with.apple.for.iphone.5/">Electronista</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/123538/">https://habr.com/ru/post/123538/</a></p>
