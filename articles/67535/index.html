People with higher education, and imagine such nonsense. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  GTD, Getting Things Done (you can safely read in Russian as Ge-Te-Te) is a system for self-organization, invented by the American author David Allen.  Since the release of the corresponding book in 2000, millions of unorganized people have finally found happiness and peace of mind.  After all, the system, as stated, allows hello affairs in order. <br><br>  <b>How does GTD work?</b> <br><br>  The basic principles of GTD are very simple.  It is based on three habits *, to which every effective person must accustom himself. <br>  1. Record your affairs <br>  2. Quickly decide what to do next <br>  3. Do what you wrote down. <br><br>  <b>1. We write the case (the author - Collect)</b> <br><br>  Why do many people experience constant stress and do not have time?  Because they keep everything in their head.  And the human brain is able to simultaneously hold in memory only 7 objects.  If you keep too much garbage in your head, many things are simply forgotten and remembered only when it is too late.  The result is all these ‚ÄúForgot‚Äù, ‚ÄúI didn't have time‚Äù, ‚ÄúAy, I'll do it tomorrow‚Äù ... <br><br>  The first step on the way to the bright head will be to put everything aside for 10 minutes, take a piece of paper and write out all the cases, questions, ideas and other things that disturb you.  Thus, we release the head and transfer all our affairs to an ‚Äúexternal carrier‚Äù. <br>  Example?  You are welcome.  I listen to the radio, and suddenly I hear an advertisement about the upcoming March 8 holiday.  The thought immediately comes to mind "It would not hurt to buy a gift for mom."  Without delaying the debt, I immediately write down: ‚ÄúBuy a gift for my mother on the eighth of March.‚Äù <br>  Is it done?  Go to the next item. <br><br>  <b>2. What's next?</b>  <b>(Process)</b> <br><br>  At this stage, you need to go through all the recorded cases and for each of them ask yourself one important question: what is the next step? <br>  This simple question is not as simple as it seems.  For example: you need to buy a gift for your mother and you diligently wrote down in a notebook ‚Äúbuy a gift for your mother on the eighth of March‚Äù. <br>  What will come of it?  Most likely, you will long look for excuses, and the gift will be bought on the last day.  Well, as a result, on the eve you will have to defend half a day in queues, although you could have bought it in five minutes a week earlier. <br><br><img src="http://mpeabody.blog.uvm.edu/wagn/present.gif" alt="present"><br><br>  Let's see what GTD advises in this case. <br>  GTD says this: first you need to highlight a specific next step for buying a gift.  A concrete step means that you tear yourself away from a chair and really do something.  For example, "Call Aunt Ole and consult about a gift."  The task suddenly became much more specific, didn‚Äôt it?  Now you don‚Äôt need to think for a long time: you need to take the phone and call right now. <br>  Here we come to the third paragraph. <br><br>  <b>3. Take and do</b> <br><br>  If everything was done right before, then at this stage there is a simple and clear task: ‚ÄúCall Aunt Ole‚Äù. <br>  This is because the final result of using the GTD system is a ‚Äúcrystal clear‚Äù list of ‚Äúnext steps‚Äù for all tasks.  This list contains specific and understandable cases that can be performed without hesitation.  All deliberations have already been held at the ‚ÄúWhat is next‚Äù stage? .. <br><br>  Now, in the presence of such a crystal-clear list, you can calmly and without distraction click things one by one, like seeds.  No extra agony, no doubt - a continuous concentrated flow of action.  Personally, when I walk in this state in order, I feel like a terminator. <br><br>  <b>Total</b> <br><br>  Here is such an interesting and useful system.  I hope this review helped to get an idea about it.  If you like it, you can try it yourself.  But keep in mind that GTD is a bit more complicated than the three points I wrote about :) <br><br>  <b>Where else can you read about GTD?</b> <br><br>  Here are the paper books: <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280">English version</a> , <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/3221756/">Russian version</a> .
