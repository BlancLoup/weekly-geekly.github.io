  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Is the fourth one superfluous?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In Moscow, on Andropov Avenue, there is a team of good people who <a href="http://altaforum.ru/blog/%3Fp%3D35">play ping-pong</a> perfectly and write <a href="http://altaforum.ru/blog/%3Fp%3D21">great texts</a> about regional search and other exciting things.  But among other things, they are developing a search engine called " <a href="http://webalta.ru/">Vebalta</a> ".  And <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/lenta/240/">recently they announced</a> that their search service will officially open for public testing on July 6, 2006, that is, exactly yesterday. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4f3/484/d51/4f3484d51890defab7c130d650fb8d9a.gif"><br><br>  The title "Vebalta" features a concise design, similar to the first version of <a href="http://www.ya.ru/">ya.ru.</a>  I hope that additional services - one of which, <a href="http://op.webalta.ru/">advertisements</a> , is now undergoing closed testing, and this month is already running - will not complicate the design.  These guys tell about their search engine attractively and even pathetically, which, at least, means that they have a good copywriter in their team.  It even seems that this piece will be able to compete with three giants - <a href="http://yandex.ru/">Yandex</a> , <a href="http://rambler.ru/">Rambler</a> and <a href="http://mail.ru/">Mail.Ru</a> , two of which actually find something, and one is made on the second engine (you guessed it, I'm talking about Yandex and Mail .Ru).  Therefore, cutting off two of them, we will only compare the new search engine with Yandex.  I don‚Äôt see any reason to draw a parallel with <a href="http://google.com/">Google</a> , since Alta is only searching on the Internet, and in support of my words I can quote, for example, Roma Voronezhsky: ‚ÄúWhen you need something in Russia, Yandex, otherwise, Google‚Äù .  And Pushkin, for that matter: ‚ÄúAnd may the young people have a life to play at the grave entrance.‚Äù

      So, for the first test, I chose the word "habrahabr".  Until recently, the word has rarely appeared on the Web, so the search can only be confused by the constant mention of this term in the comments of the programmer Yuri Balandin, who conducted some sort of intriguing advertising campaign. <br><br>  And let's compare only the first six links, as I personally can view them without using scrolling.  For my amazing query, Yandex <a href="http://www.yandex.ru/yandsearch%3Ftext%3D%25F5%25E0%25E1%25F0%25E0%25F5%25E0%25E1%25F0%26amp%3Bstype%3Dwww">found</a> 2,688 pages, and Alta found <a href="http://www.webalta.ru/search%3Fq%3D%25F5%25E0%25E1%25F0%25E0%25F5%25E0%25E1%25F0%26amp%3Bcity%3Dany">approximately 5,100</a> , which is almost twice as many.  The first result in ‚ÄúVebalta‚Äù is a completely left photo with the commentary of Balandin mentioned above.  However, as I thought, he confused everything.  The second is a discussion-related discussion with another comment by Yuri.  But - thank God!  - The other four links lead to articles about the project.  Yandex also shows amazing quality results: the first link is my article, the second is the page with my posting (thank you, Yandex!), And the rest of the space is taken up by notes and messages on the same topic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f3e/416/541/f3e416541b9e6cfb5107af3fb4988ad8.jpg"><br><br>  Now we will try to find something about the famous writer Olga Slavnikova in narrow circles.  At this time, ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù <a href="http://yandex.ru/yandsearch%3Ftext%3D%26ntilde%3B%26euml%3B%26agrave%3B%26acirc%3B%26iacute%3B%26egrave%3B%26ecirc%3B%26icirc%3B%26acirc%3B%26agrave%3B">shows the number of results</a> four times more than ‚ÄúWebbalts‚Äù.  But their quality again cannot please: in the first place is an article about Olga, the second result is the Big Book award, in which Slavnikova participated, the third and fourth place are the pages of her books in online stores, and the last two are occupied by two more articles .  Alta has only <a href="http://webalta.ru/search%3Fq%3D%26ntilde%3B%26euml%3B%26agrave%3B%26acirc%3B%26iacute%3B%26egrave%3B%26ecirc%3B%26icirc%3B%26acirc%3B%26agrave%3B">four of the six links</a> - what I was trying to find - her profile on a website, two books and one article. <br><br>  And finally, the last test.  Try to find something completely accurate.  For example, the last film Balabanova "I do not hurt."  And again, "Yandex" <a href="http://yandex.ru/yandsearch%3Ftext%3D%26igrave%3B%26iacute%3B%26aring%3B%2B%26iacute%3B%26aring%3B%2B%26aacute%3B%26icirc%3B%26euml%3B%26uuml%3B%26iacute%3B%26icirc%3B%2B%26aacute%3B%26agrave%3B%26euml%3B%26agrave%3B%26aacute%3B%26agrave%3B%26iacute%3B%26icirc%3B%26acirc%3B">shows</a> more than two times more results.  "Vebalta" the first two links <a href="http://webalta.ru/search%3Fq%3D%26igrave%3B%26iacute%3B%26aring%3B%2B%26iacute%3B%26aring%3B%2B%26aacute%3B%26icirc%3B%26euml%3B%26uuml%3B%26iacute%3B%26icirc%3B%2B%26aacute%3B%26agrave%3B%26euml%3B%26agrave%3B%26aacute%3B%26agrave%3B%26iacute%3B%26icirc%3B%26acirc%3B">gives the</a> official pages of the film and four reviews.  Actually, all that I needed.  ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù - I would never have thought!  - sends me to some forums in LJ, and in the first six gives out only one official page, and in the penultimate place.  It turns out that Webalta, like Google, perfectly finds all the official information, which is much more important than some reviews. <br><br>  In general, now their search can be estimated at four-minus.  But statements like "we will occupy a third of the search market" - this is too ambitious, in my opinion. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4135/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4135/</a></p>
