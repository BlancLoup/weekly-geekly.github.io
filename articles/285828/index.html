The main issues are the direction of training in online courses or relevant services, the positive and negative aspects of such education and the possibility of a full transition to education on the Web.  330 respondents took part in the survey, mainly students of IT specialties from Moscow State University, Moscow State Technical University.  N. E. Bauman and Kazan Federal University. <br><br>  As it turned out, only 26% of all respondents had experience in online courses.  At the same time, two thirds of these 26% said they are satisfied with the result of training.  However, about half of the respondents, 46% of respondents, said they had a complete lack of experience with educational services or online courses. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Attitude towards online education </h3>

      Of all the respondents, only 5% support the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa full transition to online learning.  The majority of students who had experience with online education, said that they are trying to improve their level of knowledge, complementing the curriculum at the university with additional online courses.  About 60% of students choose courses that are new to themselves (in subjects that they have not previously studied), plus about half of the respondents improve knowledge in areas known to themselves. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe survey showed that almost half of IT students have already taken any online courses or are going to do it.  However, many seek to study subjects that are not taught in high school.  It turns out that they have already managed to decide on their future specialization (and someone may have already started working) and now they are actively closing the gaps in the basic education.  It means that new specialists will join the industry, interested in their growth and development and having the skill of independent learning, which is very important for an IT professional at any stage of his career, ‚ÄùDmitry Voloshin, director of the research and education department at Mail.Ru Group, commented on the situation. <br><br><h3>  Pay online education </h3><br><br>  Interesting is also the attitude of the interviewed students to the possibility of paying for online education.  More than half, about 56% of respondents, answered that they were not going to pay for online education, under any circumstances.  The rest of the survey participants said they were ready to pay, but only in that case, if they received unique information and knowledge on the Web.  This category of respondents reported that they are not ready to pay if the cost of training on the Web exceeds about 3,400 rubles (on average). <br><br><h3>  Advantages and disadvantages </h3><br><br>  61% of respondents called a great advantage of online education the opportunity to choose the time and place of study.  Also, many respondents believe that education with the help of network resources allows you to better understand the topic.  The same audio or video lectures can be listened to again and again, without fear of missing something, plus many are attracted by the opportunity to undergo a test for learning the material. <br><br>  Some students noted that online education is good in itself, but in this case there are a lot of distractions - because no one controls the course of classes, and social networks and other entertainment are very distracting, while it is difficult to refuse such factors.  Another drawback is the difficulty or impossibility of communication with the teacher. <br><br>  As mentioned above, the majority of respondents prefer courses, where you can get practical tasks, with which you can check the level of assimilation of the materials received.  This form of training is chosen by 60% of survey participants.  But at the same time, only 44% of respondents pass all classes, without missing anything.  Approximately 30% pass only part of the theory, while performing all practical exercises, and only 16% listen exclusively to lectures, without undergoing practice. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285828/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285828/</a></p>
