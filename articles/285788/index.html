  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What will happen to niche IT-editions in 2015 - a survey of "Megamind"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We are continuing a series of publications about how the Internet business lives in all its different manifestations. <br><br>  Last time we talked with <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/8612/">representatives of the advertising market</a> and discussed the results of 2014 and the outlook for 2015.  This time we asked questions to representatives of leading industry publications of the IT orientation. <br><br>  Four respondents kindly answered our questions: Alexey Ametov, general director of <a href="http://www.lookatme.ru/">LookAtMedia</a> Publishing House, Dmitry Falaleev, <a href="http://firrma.ru/">Firrma</a> editor-in-chief, Yury Sinodov, editor-in-chief of <a href="https://roem.ru/">Roem,</a> and Denis Kryuchkov, publisher <a href="http://tmtm.ru/">of TM,</a> answered our questions. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Question one: are you satisfied with the results of 2014?  What are your overall expectations for 2015? </h3><br><h4>  Alexey Ametov, LAM: </h4><blockquote>  No, not very pleased, although we have a better year than it could have been. </blockquote><br><h4>  Dmitry Falaleev, Firrma: </h4><blockquote>  In general, more or less satisfied.  The expectations are alarming, but there is an understanding of where to go and there is an understanding that this will be a good opportunity to realize many ideas.  The main thing is that our market (venture) is not covered. </blockquote><br><h4>  Yuri Synodov, Roem: </h4><blockquote>  I do not divide my activities into periods, so I can‚Äôt show the report for the year.  But on the whole, I am satisfied - the year started off badly, but it ended even worse for everyone, but we are fine, a lot of moving.  Some things could have done better, of course, and they are not happy. </blockquote><br><h4>  Denis Kryuchkov, TM: </h4><blockquote>  It was our best year in all respects.  We not only showed good revenue, but also made the company more sustainable.  The crisis of 2008‚Äì2009 taught us to diversify business.  Today we have thousands of clients, and the share of revenues from display advertising in the total revenue structure is decreasing and is already generating less than 50% of our revenue. </blockquote>

    <h3>  Question two: your forecast for the state of technology niche media in 2015? </h3><br><h4>  Alexey Ametov, LAM: </h4><blockquote>  It will be hard for everyone to earn their money.  Therefore, the development will be very modest. </blockquote><br><h4>  Dmitry Falaleev, Firrma: </h4><blockquote>  In principle, the answer to this question above is contained.  The year will be hard, everyone already understands this.  The state will - survive, but it is a good test of strength. </blockquote><br><h4>  Yuri Synodov, Roem: </h4><blockquote>  They will sit and illuminate their niche, I suspect. </blockquote><br><h4>  Denis Kryuchkov, TM: </h4><blockquote>  It will be hard.  Especially those who are recently on the market. </blockquote><br><br><h3>  Question three: Do you plan to downsize editorial staff? </h3><br><h4>  Alexey Ametov, LAM: </h4><blockquote>  At the moment, we have a ban on hiring employees to replace the outgoing ones, although we were recently forced to break it and hired a couple of people.  But in general we are a small company, we have nowhere to shrink especially, but we definitely will not grow. </blockquote><br><h4>  Dmitry Falaleev, Firrma: </h4><blockquote>  Not. </blockquote><br><h4>  Yuri Synodov, Roem: </h4><blockquote>  The size of our editorial staff is such that we can reduce it either by 50% or 100%.  Or do not cut at all.  I think it‚Äôs best not to cut it.  I am sure that the editors are solidary with me on this issue. </blockquote><br><h4>  Denis Kryuchkov, TM: </h4><blockquote>  Not.  We actively hired the whole of January and increased the staff of authors.  We see great potential in Geektimes and Megamind.  According to our estimates in a few years Geektimes can overtake "Habrahabr".  We always develop projects with an eye to the future.  We know that if you wait, the result will be better. </blockquote><br><br><h3>  Question four: Do you expect advertisers to drop in revenue / care? </h3><br><h4>  Alexey Ametov, LAM: </h4><blockquote>  If we evaluate in dollars, the market has already declined by half.  Now let's see whether it will fall in rubles.  My prediction is that advertising on the Internet, unlike TV and the press, should not fall much, maybe five percent. </blockquote><br><h4>  Dmitry Falaleev, Firrma: </h4><blockquote>  It's not clear yet. </blockquote><br><h4>  Yuri Synodov, Roem: </h4><blockquote>  Why should I? </blockquote><br><h4>  Denis Kryuchkov, TM: </h4><blockquote>  At the moment, we see no problems with the extension of contracts with major advertisers.  Our main clients conduct their main activities outside the Russian Federation, thus, crisis phenomena in the Russian economy do not affect our cooperation.  With some companies, our relationship, by contrast, became even more extensive. </blockquote><br><br><h3>  Fifth question: Your advice to colleagues (or competitors - whatever you like) this year? </h3><br><h4>  Alexey Ametov, LAM: </h4><blockquote>  My advice is simple - fasten. </blockquote><br><h4>  Dmitry Falaleev, Firrma: </h4><blockquote>  Look for new business models. </blockquote><br><h4>  Yuri Synodov, Roem: </h4><blockquote>  Read Roem.ru, we are cool. </blockquote><br><h4>  Denis Kryuchkov, TM: </h4><blockquote>  After the fall, there will always be growth.  Every cycle has an end.  We must endure and believe in the best. </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285788/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285788/</a></p>
