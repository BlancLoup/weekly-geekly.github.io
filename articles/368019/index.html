They are very fond of scientific cartoons, especially in physics and astronomy, as soon as the tablet falls into their hands, little fingers begin to quickly sort through videos from YouTube in search of interesting content.  And what do they find there?  Since I am not only the father of two children, but also devoted a significant part of my life to the methodology of teaching physics for young children, I know what teachers show to children, as well as caring parents and good grandmothers.  I have to say, not all of this should be shown to children. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  It is not worth seeing a child </h4><br>  Not for the first year, laws have been passed to ‚Äúsave children from the harmful effects of the Internet,‚Äù but I believe that pseudo-educational cartoons can cause much greater damage to the psyche and development of the child, unlike the content that he will never see. <br><br>  As the most vivid and colorful example, consider the cartoon ‚ÄúPhysics for the youngest.‚Äù This is a cartoon from the famous and by many very respected director Robert Sahakyants.  The cartoon has received huge popularity and recognition among parents of grandmothers and even teachers.  So what exactly is he like?

      For 45 minutes, an inquisitive hare conducts a dialogue with a smart robot, who with examples explains to him what physics is and why it is needed.  It is quite a good plot for a children's cartoon, however, during this time the robot makes about fifty gross blunders and mistakes!  And I do not see the point of listing them all.  But one of the statements of the robot hurt my heart so much that I decided to publish this article.  Namely, a fragment, when a hare already ignited by science asks the robot: <br><blockquote>  -Well, maybe, then I will also open some sort of law? <br>  - <b>Yes, the same open, which has already been opened, so it is better not to risk it</b> . <br></blockquote><br>  Thus, the author informs the children that it is better not to even try to open something of their own.  This goes in full section with the way the development and formation of the child is seen by me and, probably, by the majority of readers of this post. <br><br>  That's actually the cartoon itself.  The juice starts at 9:06, it‚Äôs better not to watch for more than three minutes. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/fbANjksj1Sg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhj7UWkltybTXNMjcvfwZqyB850kGg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  These videos are very popular, they are the first to pop up in parental search queries such as: ‚Äúcartoon physics for little ones‚Äù, my children often get them walking on thematic links from YouTube, and this cartoon is sometimes shown in the school teacher.  It is hard to believe in the last, but I used to conduct classes every month with physics teachers from my field and asked the question, what do they show to children?  The answers sometimes made me sad. <br><br>  It should be added that Robert Sahakyants decided to acquaint children not only with physics, but also with mathematics, astronomy, biology, etc., these cartoons received no less popular and came out with similar names "... for the smallest." <br><br><h4>  It is worth seeing a child </h4><br>  Recommended Video: <br><br><ol><li>  Fixies </li><li>  Pochemuchek family </li><li>  Why </li></ol><br>  I propose to add a black and white list in the comments. <br><br>  Programs and links: <br><br><ol><li>  Google Earth - In addition, children will be able to see our planet from space, the program allows you to see the panoramas of the Moon and Mars from mission sites, as well as take a virtual walk on their surfaces. </li><li>  Stellarium and its ‚Äútablet‚Äù counterparts - This application can be used not only at night under a starry sky.  With particular interest, children are looking for planets.  Children also like the colorful models of the solar system. </li><li>  Posts from <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/zelenyikot/" class="user_link">Zelenyikot</a> - Just opening a post and leaving it to familiarize a six-year-old child is pointless, but if you show images and retell, your eyes will immediately light up for space travel.  I have repeatedly used the materials of Vitaly Egorov in my circle of astronomy. </li></ol><br><h4>  The most important </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/089/a6c/059/089a6c0590d1430ea887dad0a7d3cb28.jpg"><br><br>  The child learns the world best of all if he touches it with his hands, so if you really want to provoke an unquenchable interest in science in your child, do experiments with him: <br><br><ol><li>  Go with him to the science museum. </li><li>  Collect ordinary flashlight. </li><li>  Make the ping-pong ball soar in the air stream from the hair dryer. </li><li>  Make a microscope from a drop on the glass. </li><li>  Assemble the unipolar motor. </li><li>  Make a compass from a magnetized needle on the water. </li><li>  Create your kaleidoscope. </li><li>  Show the night sky and the milky way (outside the city). </li><li>  Show Saturn and the Moon through a telescope. </li><li>  Demonstrate how to build an image with a lens (a conventional magnifying glass). </li><li>  Assemble the camera obscura. </li><li>  Electrify the balloon and stick it to the wall. </li><li>  Buy an ultraviolet flashlight and turn off the light in the room. </li><li>  Buy a plasma lamp and light a fluorescent lamp in the hands of a child (do not leave alone with the lamp). </li><li>  Buy soap bubbles. </li><li>  ... </li></ol><br>  I can list this list for a long time, different experiments are suitable for children of different ages.  Do not be lazy to find and conduct a couple of experiments that are most suitable for yours.  I wish you exciting experiments! <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> Thanks to the commentators who drew my attention to the fact that I misunderstood the dialogue between the hare and the robot.  For example, a note from <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/demchuk13/" class="user_link">demchuk13</a> : <br><blockquote>  In the cartoon: <br>  - ... at least you will understand why the subject falls from above ... <br>  ‚ÄúAnd how high I can throw a stone.‚Äù <br>  - And with what force he falls on your head. <br>  - Well, maybe, then, too, I will open some law? <br>  - Yes, the same open, which has already been opened, so it is better not to risk it. <br>  Consequently, the author informs the children that it is better not to even try to throw stones upwards, as there is a risk of damaging the head with a fallen stone.  And this, in my opinion, is not so bad. <br></blockquote><br>  Thus, one of the main complaints about the cartoon I am shooting. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/368019/">https://habr.com/ru/post/368019/</a></p>
