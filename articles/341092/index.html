  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Results of web activity after 10 years</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  10 years have passed since I started providing web and photo services.  The start came exactly 1 year before the second-largest global financial and economic crisis of 2009, which was also bulldozed throughout the national economy.  And then the crisis of 2014, my complete rejection of the rapid interaction with individuals and the majority of legal entities.  Revaluation of all activities and a complete reboot ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  I can say with confidence that the entire commercial IT industry (and many others) experienced all the consequences of the 2014 crisis, though in a very strong form, because our work with you is one of the most difficult, it‚Äôs intellectual services.  They are difficult to assess and very difficult to carry out alone, so you need to have additional knowledge in finance, accounting and economics to correctly accompany the transaction from beginning to end.  All this may be the cause of rapid disappointment in working with individuals, whether offline or online.  Therefore, at least more or less well-established teams survive, but private specialists have a hard time.  I think many of you, languidly and quietly about themselves, now said ‚ÄúYes-ah.‚Äù <br><br></p><h2>  Essence in the sand </h2><br><p>  It would seem, understanding the causal relationship when working with any project, as well as the value of the product produced by me, you can establish an ideal relationship with a customer from any segment, but it was not there.  Time passes, and people, unfortunately, do not change much, and rudeness, in various forms, from customers, contractors or partners, comes regularly.  It is known that very few people love when someone starts to ‚Äúget smart.‚Äù  But questions are asked and everything is discussed solely on business, in order to get quality not in terms of beautiful graphics on pleasant paper.  On the example of fast printing products (razdatka): for the client it is rubbish - why spend such insane money on typesetting in order to give it away and forget it?  But only 1 out of 10 clients were pleasantly surprised by my approach, that I sell not a picture on paper, but communication.  This ‚Äúpiece of paper‚Äù will affect, sell, invite or leave a pleasant impression.  This is, in fact, a key participant in the sales channel.  The surprise of customers about the price, begins to gradually subside as it is explained once again that the layout designer must impose, and not engage in market research and collect graphic elements all over the Internet. <br><br></p><h2>  Investments in own degradation </h2><br><p>  For all the work I did discounts, almost without thinking or bargaining a little.  They do the same thing in general.  The circumstances, of course, were different, but the principle is the same everywhere.  Again, we don‚Äôt forget that I don‚Äôt sell a batch of chairs, which we have to stupidly bring and bring - I provide services, where you have to think a lot first, negotiate, and then draw / build / assemble / run, in the end, correctly push a lot buttons.  As time went on, various rakes arose, wisdom appeared.  And that's what I came to.  I didn‚Äôt want to spit on the fact that there the client nagred in his head about all sorts of beauty - there is a task formulated by the TK, certified with me, that the scheme worked, and that the lead on the site was converted so that the guest did not throw out the piece of paper, left it and rang the bell.  And when I call the price for the work, which I am ready to do qualitatively and satisfy the required level, and in response they ask me to do the same work in half, one very interesting thing happens.  Agreeing to a discount, I, of course, hardly, but I will earn, naively believing that there will be more orders, but according to the results of the process, I, without knowing it, invested in someone else's business!  When a client, without figuring out the situation, simply stupidly deceives the price tag, without delving into the particular production, he is in principle veiled rude.  Yes, I believe that this is rudeness, well written off on various problems.  This is still half the problem.  The remaining 50% of trouble is the fact that I'm starting to slip in my progress.  I do not develop, I stand still, burning a lot of time to fulfill an order.  Combining the first with the last, we get a very unpleasant picture: with such treatment, it turns out that the client is not interested in my development.  Whether the client understands this or not, but he himself builds himself a line of stupid neutrality on the part of the performer, when neither good nor bad, but simply nothing.  This means that I will not be able to provide him a higher service next time, equipped with additional chips and bonuses, and also help in any other areas.

    </p><h2>  Reboot </h2><br><p>  Understanding that the situation does not change, you need to change yourself.  Therefore, final and unconditional directives have been made to work with individuals on individual graphic orders, exclusively on prior application, with consideration and issuance of a separate production time for products.  With web outsourcing, the situation has radically changed.  Now, in order to begin negotiations with the company, the management should try to convince me that it is possible and necessary to cooperate with them.  In the rest of the plan, the work is only on recommendation, and my client should recommend his client to his partner.  Full reorientation into own projects, from which, until recently, dust was simply erased. <br><br>  Own development, web services and startups, only hardcore! <br><br>  If you don‚Äôt drive me away with pissing rags, in the next publication I‚Äôll tell you what I‚Äôve seen interesting in these 10 years: how my acquaintances went bankrupt, how they turned from dollar millionaires into managers with salaries, how honestly earned houses they lost and got over to the village house.  But it will not be sad stories, because Habra is not for this.  This will be a small psychological analysis in the framework of freelancing, business and harsh reality.  Let's talk :) <br><br>  All good and successful projects.  Take care of yourself. </p></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/341092/">https://habr.com/ru/post/341092/</a></p>
