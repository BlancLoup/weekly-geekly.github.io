That clears up in my head when communicating with you, or simply while contemplating reality or during the transition from a sleepy state to wakefulness.  Yes, you are a child, a fidget, pouring in a stream of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/testing/87697/">questions</a> , trying to bring me to a white-hot when there is complete misunderstanding or alienation.  How familiar is this behavior and state to parents and children!  Of course, I want to believe that growing up is about to come, and these explanations and, conversely, nebulae, will become clear to you and give a clue to the events or outline my current state.  Strangely enough, but the state, the attitude, the mood, are very important both for mutual understanding and for comprehending complex matters, sometimes they provide more benefits than strict rationales and algorithms.  There is nothing better for immersion in the state of contemplation of your inner world than movement, or rather a long journey in a train or on a motorcycle.  Motorcycle limits the circle of communication and leads to extensive internal monologues, surveys, digging, to such a shatokua - but what about that!  and the train - to the disclosure of any secret information, splash streams of the soul in front of an occasional companion.  But back to testing. <br>  What is the purpose of testing, you ask, where is it, is it attainable, can you choose the right way to guarantee 90% of the success of the result?  You, as well as your peers want to guess and magically fly from task to solution, as in your favorite computer games.  And, for sure, you children flatter yourself with the hope of using the cherished cheat codes to return to the previous level in case of failure or with a close smell of defeat - you do not like to lose!  You believe, of course, not in the afterlife, not in life after death, but rather in restarting the whole process, in the ability to turn off this game, this terrible day, turn off the brain, change jobs, partner, family, city, country, and start a new life game from scratch.  Blessed is he who believes! <br>  Our generation is not much different in terms of illusions and self-deception, no.  I do not seek to oppose generations or pour moral streams.  By no means.  I pour out a stream of consciousness to regain awareness of my understanding of these issues based on my experience, experience that you will not pass on to inheritance ... This is the main problem of fathers and children, it is the imperfection of the mechanism of heredity that people used to solve with some uncertainty by writing , creating a movie, this is the essence of creativity - to convey experience, feelings, warn, direct, develop ... <br>  ... <br>  You understand, this is all nonsense, chatter, nonsense ... a melancholic stream of little connected words ... Turns, wind, fussing on the road ... <br>  ... <br>  There can be no guarantee (of a reproducible repeatable process) of successfully solving a problem from successfully selecting a target for such an uncertain process of activity as program development.  Some say that the program has a number of variations, more than stars in the universe.  Handsomely!  Stars!  Constellations!  Galaxies!  People have achieved stability in construction, in the design of mechanisms, in electronics.  Noticeable decrease in approval assertion when listing?  But programs have a much greater degree of freedom, which means they are more unstable, flicker like stars ... They work, they don't, sometimes they are unpredictable, if you apply non-typical approaches to them. <br>  And testing, as a <u>model of intensive use</u> , is trying to find ways or structural elements of stability in programs and, first of all - yes, this is <b>AIM</b> - areas of system instability. <br>  That's all, the goal is defined, then - emptiness, again uncertainty.  Or will there be a curtain?  Everything was prosaic, don't you think, sweetheart?  You wanted to open a goal, find out the short road to it, but what's next?  You hurried.  Where next?  Sometimes you can not go directly to the goal, if there is no certainty that you will see the next one behind it.  But you will see, I'm sure!  And if not, then just enter the magic code or click on the reset button and - voila!  - you are in a new place, and you can go to a new goal. <br>  My vision and my excuse for my grumbling that I put strength in the <b>WAY</b> , my path is my life, this is my goal!  So in testing - I use the tools for the effectiveness of the path, because efficiency is more certainty at each point in time.  Efficiency is an impulse, it is power, it is confidence here and now, it is the intensity of life, the frequency of using the system that exceeds the designed one.  The tool says nothing about the goal, but it rapidly brings it closer.  The tool is adrenaline!  You're right, the tool can be useless, expensive, dangerous and even harmful!  But I learned to repair motorcycles, and you too can!  Will this help you in achieving your goal that is so clear and intimate, or will you be able to outgrow this state of evidence and start moving forward by doing the right things right?  I chose the right actions, you chose the right things.  Will there be a synergistic leap?  Do you or someone after you?  Life will show... <br><br>  Start our bike, let's go! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/e73b1c5b/5b87ecbd/18f5b138/69d45ac1.jpg"></blockquote></div>
