  <section class="page js-page"><h1>6 fresh examples of parsing and design improvements in simple ways</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Last week we launched an experiment - free design assistance.  Everyone who wanted was tagged with the #logomachine_help hashtag design that needed advice or refinement, and we chose who we could help and played with fonts, chose a color, improved the layout.  I will say straight away that this is not a full-fledged design, but rather visual tips, so they are made on the go in Photoshop and allow inaccuracies and simplifications.  But these examples will help everyone understand the problems in their design and improve it in a couple of clicks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/15e/dd4/b29/15edd4b29890456aa62b922d954880b7.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  "Expedition" sticker: we strengthen elements </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3d6/770/d43/3d6770d43bec46488c9afaefd07cb2dc.png"><br><br>  Immediately highlight the problems that appear when using a sticker with this design: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <i>1. The elements are small and thin, the name is less than the subscript</i> <i><br></i>  <i>2. The sticker is almost all white.</i>  <i>From a distance meter it will turn into a spot with gray scribbles</i> <br><br>  Quickly fix the main problems: increase the name, add color.  The carabiner that prevented you from reading the name will be made central.  Behind we enclose a bright contour of the mountains and make wide fields to protect the sticker from being stripped off: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/952/4f2/2c5/9524f22c58b142b7b25bf79a792d812d.png"><br><br>  Such a sticker will be recognized better than the original due to the bright combination of colors and large text.  Let's do the so-called ‚Äúsquint test‚Äù: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/21f/508/c16/21f508c166a14df4946c18a63309d1ea.png"><br><br>  At the same time let's estimate how the sticker will look in life when it fades and is wrapped around: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/08d/702/14b/08d70214b6c64cee8bb5a32da5e867be.png"><br><br>  <b>Summarize</b> <br><br>  Pros: <br><br>  + The sticker has become more expressive due to accents and bright colors. <br>  + The name has become better readable and the recognition of the sticker has increased <br><br>  Minuses: <br><br>  - ‚Äúnaivety‚Äù disappeared.  It is evident that not children did, it became stereotypical <br><br><h2>  Pally Store: add man-made </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/697/09b/1c9/69709b1c9608484995a57fd009ebe6c1.png"><br><br>  This logo had no description, so I had to fantasize.  Apparently, this is a sign or sign of a store, made in the form of a lid from the barrel.  Probably, in this store everything natural, hand-made, natural, or, as it is fashionable to say, ‚Äúcrafting,‚Äù is appreciated.  Then the problem is one: <br><br>  <i>1. Too computer inscription: you can‚Äôt write two identical "L"</i> <br><br>  A simple piece of advice to anyone who wants to make an inscription in handwriting: do not be lazy and actually write by hand.  It will be more alive than any computer font.  Write ‚ÄúPally Store‚Äù with a marker and pencil on paper: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/657/1ea/e7d/6571eae7d38e44bea6613cb22b600a25.png"><br><br>  It now remains to circle the letters in the illustrator and put it in Photoshop on the lid of the barrel.  We did not spend a lot of time on it, but even so it is clear that it became more ‚Äúmentally‚Äù, as if someone had painted paint on wood: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/91c/c14/36c/91cc1436c12641169386f0dc9ef98672.png"><br><br>  <b>To summarize the restyling</b> <br><br>  Pros: <br><br>  + The sign has become more man-made, it gives a feeling of comfort <br><br>  Minuses: <br><br>  - The handwritten inscription on the tree is difficult to read.  If there is a small format, you will need a simplified version. <br><br><h2>  Excel specialist business card: visualize the idea </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ed1/f8e/296/ed1f8e29696248dab2a41fdc26553a2b.png"><br><br>  And what if you make a business card in the form of the table itself?  Let's estimate: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/086/2d9/c8d/0862d9c8d23243f2b83988320e2d5bc9.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/851/4a4/d65/8514a4d652b04018a4c61a1e9ec2c965.png"><br><br>  <b>Bottom line: it</b> will turn out cool :) <br><br><h2>  SibTransNavigation: we play with fonts </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3ad/9c0/9b4/3ad9c09b4f144222b7d5bf578cc13213.png"><br><br>  This example illustrates the rule: effects with fonts are not friendly (with rare exceptions).  We highlight the main problems: <br><br>  <i>1. Effects spoil the readability and bring us back to the nineties, when everyone was crazy about the possibilities of Word Art.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>2. The already complex name was squeezed in the way it was done with the inscription ‚ÄúMinistry of Health warns‚Äù so that it could not be read.</i> <br><br>  Simply replace the pinched Impact with two free fonts with no effects: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/067/938/488/0679384884974bbcba9693be8c229ff3.png"><br><br>  Compare readability: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c90/60e/74a/c9060e74a27042ec918dfdd698571525.png"><br><br>  <b>Summarize:</b> <br><br>  + Having got rid of the effects, the logo stepped from the nineties into the two thousandth <br>  + Not clamped letters began to be better read. <br><br>  - The logo has become longer <br>  - If recognition is important, you need to come up with the SibTransNavigation emblem <br><br><h2>  Paragon: improving the composition </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e6c/fac/4b9/e6cfac4b9ba74d2aad63c139c57d7f00.png"><br><br>  Sergey is right - the logo needs to be improved: <br><br>  <i>1. In the text part mixed lowercase and uppercase.</i>  <i>Look carefully: it is not written PARAGON and ParaGOn.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>2. The sign is falling apart.</i>  <i>The idea is clear - the letters P and G and between them S. But the composition is not dynamic and not static - just the lines are heaped.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>3. Mutual dimensions of the signature, sign and text part need to be improved - there is no clear emphasis and mutual connection.</i>  <i>Everything is about the same in mass.</i> <br><br>  We proceed to the redesign: we will type the text part, strengthen the composition and at the same time ‚Äúmodernize‚Äù the faded blue.  Instead of a sign, we use a square ‚Äî the original sign is to its form: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/178/6c4/59a/1786c459aab0405e87c3e59d7428d4f4.png"><br><br>  The composition is assembled, now you can dream up, what could be the sign.  Let's take the most graphic element of the original logo, ‚ÄúG‚Äù and estimate it directly in Photoshop: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/463/93b/969/46393b9699e6495e86e3ca9ccd3357d9.png"><br><br>  Looks cool, reminds%.  And you can pull out the leg for the "P" from the first letter.  This will break the symmetry, but will make the original meaning of ‚ÄúPG‚Äù explicit: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/05f/677/85b/05f67785b2b84adea2929c6ee426ee4a.png"><br><br>  <b>Total:</b> <br><br>  + The logo has become more clear and complete due to the composition, colors and mark <br><br>  - The original ‚ÄúGreek‚Äù motifs disappeared, the sign is no longer a rebus of PG and S <br><br><h2>  Some people: choose the best option </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a9a/4d7/0ac/a9a4d70ac9044c219589b311dee3939b.png"><br><br>  Choose the most promising option and make it more graphical: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/85f/a8a/9dc/85fa8a9dc4e741fca397b986892d36a5.png"><br><br>  We know that this is a store sign, so you can take an important step: think of how the logo will "live."  Based on the name ‚ÄúSome people‚Äù, you can use different photos of people as corporate identity elements.  Take free from <a href="http://unsplash.com/">unsplash.com</a> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ae1/93c/e02/ae193ce020684dddbe6af19ec7598c18.png"><br><br>  This will be a step in the direction of what is called a ‚Äúdynamic identity‚Äù - the rules by which brand elements are built, instead of one permanent sign.  For ‚ÄúSome people‚Äù we can use different photos of people in a large format, and in small ones leave a colored logo.  For example, on the box you can take a photo, but on the label you can‚Äôt see it anymore, we use color: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/842/6d0/76d/8426d076d35e4c09a324f4fce61b284f.png"><br><br>  <b>Bottom line: a</b> simple sign turned into what is called a "visual hammer."  With it, you can easily make recognizable business cards, a sign, arrange posts in social networks.  Firstly, it will increase the recognition of ‚ÄúSome people‚Äù, and secondly, it will be easy to make each contact point with the client branded.  This will show that ‚ÄúSome people‚Äù have the strength and resources to pay attention to detail. <br><br><h2>  Let's summarize </h2><br>  Not all solutions are perfect, many should be brought to mind or made more unique.  But, I think, as an example of simple improvements, they are quite suitable.  Most of them - cutting off the excess, placing accents and increasing awareness "in life."  The tendency to simplify is not so much a trend (it is already more than half a century), as a practical step towards improving perception. <br><br>  If you need our logo design advice and more, use the hashtag #logomachine_help in social networks - we follow it and select candidates for redesign.  And, as always, good design for your projects! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/325994/">https://habr.com/ru/post/325994/</a></p>
