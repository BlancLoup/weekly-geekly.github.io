As a result of the campaign, the conversion into lead on the Intouch page is from 1.5% to 2.02%.  We tell how we managed to bring people who were interested in buying to the site. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Banner advertising, sponsored articles and native advertising are the most common media advertising formats. 
      <br>

      <br>
      Each of the formats has its own characteristics: <br><br><ul><li>  Banner advertising is a tool to increase awareness, but it almost does not generate traffic. </li><li>  <a href="https://blog.relap.ru/2016/03/millenial/">According to studies,</a> 64% of all clicks on banners are made by only 10% of users. </li><li>  Users enjoy reading sponsored articles, but rarely go from them to the advertiser's site. </li><li>  Native advertising embedded in the tape of the publication, gives the brand the opportunity to interact with customers on its own site. </li></ul><br>  To collect applications for insurance, Intouch created a form on its website that allows you to quickly calculate the cost of insurance and order it.  Users had to interact with this form, so from all the tools for advertising in the media chose native advertising. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/10b/afb/cbe/10bafbcbef4049c5a833b3e713f45338.png"><br><br><h2>  Intouch and Relap Native Campaign Results </h2><br><h3>  Goals </h3><br>  Bring the conversion audience to the Intouch site from the sites of the Russian media. <br><br>  Geotargeting Moscow and St. Petersburg. <br><br><h3>  An approach </h3><br>  Targeted native media advertising. <br><br>  Custom segmentation of the audience of media readers. <br><br>  Elimination of incorrectly filled in questionnaires at the application stage. <br><br><h3>  results </h3><br>  The average conversion of a creative to a click is the same as the average conversion of ordinary articles in the media where the advertisement was placed. <br><br>  The lead conversion with the correct phone number on the Intouch page is from 1.5% to 2.02%. <br><br>  For 4 months, Intouch's placement volume in Relap has grown 4 times. <br><br>  <b>Dmitry Zotov</b> , media manager: <br><br><blockquote>  According to the test results, it became clear that Relap allows us to achieve good performance results when placed in the media. <br><br>  Native advertising Relap gives you the opportunity to get the predicted number of quality transitions and applications.  We have a new high-conversion channel that helps us attract our target audience. </blockquote><br><h2>  How to set up a campaign? </h2><br><h3>  Lead verification </h3><br>  <b>Dmitry Zotov</b> , media manager: <br><br><blockquote>  To apply for insurance, the user had to fill in information about himself and his car.  We automated verification of leads so that only valid questionnaires came to us from the form.  Applications that were incorrectly filled out we did not take into account.  Therefore, when evaluating the effectiveness of Relap, only correct data was taken into account. </blockquote><br><h3>  Audience segmentation </h3><br>  Relap is used by more than 3,500 Russian media, with a total audience of 60 million people.  We know where and what articles are read by users, and we analyze the content of the texts.  Thanks to this, we can distinguish audience segments by interest. <br><br>  For Intouch, we have identified automotive and insurance segments: these were readers who have recently been interested in insurance and related topics. <br><br>  Relap advertising works cross-domainly: we can show advertisements for insurance on RIA Novosti for those who have previously been interested in insurance on a car website. <br><br>  So, by analyzing user behavior, we managed to bring people who were interested in purchasing insurance to the Intouch site. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/318586/">https://habr.com/ru/post/318586/</a></p>
