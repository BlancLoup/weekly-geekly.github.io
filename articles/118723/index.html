  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Yandex.Money users to note</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Once upon a time, three or four years ago, I registered an account with Yandex.Money. <br>  Looked and forgot. <br><br>  Now I decided to start using this account, but of course I don‚Äôt remember the password.  I go into my wallet, poke "restore password", I receive a letter with a link - I click and I am stunned. <br><br>  It turns out that to change the payment password, you need to enter a secret code of 5 digits, which asked along with the password.  Like this.  To recover one password - you need to remember another. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Of course, restore access failed.  I am writing a letter to the support service. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  A long time ago I registered with Yandex.Money, just have a look.  Some time <br>  back, I wanted to try to use the system, and, of course, the payment password <br>  I do not remember.  I could not restore either - because they asked for the code word, <br>  which I do not remember even more. <br><br>  Registered for the sake of "look", never used the account, money is not <br>  spent and in general there was always empty. <br><br>  Since I can‚Äôt remember the password, can I somehow just delete this account, <br>  so that I can register a new one and start using it normally <br>  Yandex.Money? <br><br>  For the sake of this, I do not want to duplicate an account on Yandex.  In advance <br>  thank! <br></blockquote><br>  A standard reply comes (rather long, I will not give it) with recovery options. <br>  In short, options 4: <br>  1. Reset recovery attempts and guess your password from five times. <br>  2. If the phone was attached - get a new password for it. <br>  3. Remember your password (seriously, so I suggest!) <br>  4. Come to the office with documents or send a notarized letter. <br><br>  No option suits me.  Why it is impossible to send the recovery code to the post office, but it is possible to the phone - it is not clear  Clearly, this is the standard answer to my situation.  I am writing a second letter. <br><br><blockquote>  Dear Yandex.  I expected more attention from you. <br>  You answered me with a standard reply, in which there is nothing new.  I have already read all this in your help section, so I applied for a separate application. <br><br>  My Yandex wallet has never been used, there has never been any money.  I do not want to recover the payment from him, the password forgotten 4 years ago.  I just want to delete this wallet and create a new one.  So I entered a good password that I will not forget, and immediately tied my phone to it. <br><br>  Just look at the history of operations on my account No. 410011162 -----, and you will see that the account has never been used.  I opened this wallet out of curiosity, so I didn‚Äôt get serious about creating a password.  After all, I expected that having a Yandex account, a mailbox - I can always recover the password.  Well, I did not think that if I forgot the password - you need to remember the code numbers! <br>  I have an account on Yandex for more than 5 years.  I use Mail, Metric, traffic rules, I recently tried Direct - I liked it a lot, and therefore I remembered about Yandex.Money.  But I can not use them. <br><br>  Tell me please, can you still delete this wallet and create a new one, or should I continue to use the services of your competitors? <br></blockquote><br>  With a sinking heart, I am waiting for an answer - and here it is! <br><br><blockquote>  Hello. <br>  Unfortunately, even if the account is closed, it will still remain associated with the login, and it will be impossible to create a new account for the same login. <br><br>  You can create a new login and open a new account under this login. <br><br>  If you want to delete an old account, you can delete mail on Yandex, in this case, the login will be blocked, and no one will be able to log in under it.  However, this login will not be released for re-registration and the money can still be credited to the account. <br><br>  In addition, you can write an application for closing the account and submit it personally in our office or notarize the signature and send it by mail.  In this case, it will not be possible to transfer money to a closed account, but this will not allow a new account to be tied to a login. <br><br>  Thank you for your request. <br></blockquote><br><br>  In your own words: <i>if you want to delete an account, delete the mail, but the account will still work</i> . <br><br>  This, I have not even met Webmoney.  With an overdue certificate, I didn‚Äôt take much trouble, using scanned copies of my passport to restore everything there. <br>  And then - or a registered letter through a notary, or get a new login! <br><br>  If the topic is seen by representatives of Yandex - I have a question: <br>  <s><b>Why can I send a recovery code to my phone, but not by mail?</b></s>  <s>Do you think that your mail is more accessible to an attacker than my mobile?</s> <br>  The comments explain that this is for better security.  If they take the mail away, they will get access to the money.  Okay. <br><br>  But in my case, you can reset the password!  There was not a single account transaction, it was never used.  All this can be seen, if you look at the history of operations (probably).  But no one wants to strain, apparently. <br><br>  I continue to use Qiwi and Webmoney. <br><br>  <b>UPD.</b> <br>  Anyone who advises to go to the notary, sit in the queue, explain to him the essence of the question, pay the loot, go to the post office, defend the queue, send a letter, wait until it comes and start using your account - I reply, thank you! <br>  I will not do that.  Now the desire to use this poison service disappeared altogether. <br><br>  <b>UPD2</b> <br>  Friends, the discussion slipped into password recovery.  And I would like to emphasize that I was not going to recover the password - I don‚Äôt need it!  I need this account at all. <br>  I need a second chance to get an account, set the correct password and start using I-D. <br>  But you can not. <br><br>  <b>UPD3</b> <br>  Another letter arrived <br><blockquote>  Hello. <br><br>  Our rules are mandatory for everyone, and we cannot make an exception.  By starting to use our system, you have confirmed that you accept the ‚ÄúTerms of Use‚Äù.  To restore access you need to act as we recommended in previous letters. <br><br>  Unfortunately, we have no opportunity to continue the discussion of this issue.  Thank you for understanding. <br><br>  Thank you for your request. <br></blockquote><br>  The law is harsh, but it is the law! <br>  But now we know that Yandex cannot delete the I-d account, and even after the main mail account is deleted, the account will remain. <br><br>  <b>UPD4</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/eCommerce/120395/">Unexpected continuation of the story.</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/118723/">https://habr.com/ru/post/118723/</a></p>
