From a penthouse at home for a million bucks, ‚Äùa Mongolian student told me today. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/148/6ed/735/1486ed73559046c59c4cd025ddcf36df.jpg"><br><br>  ‚ÄúTo shake is not tossing bags, good luck, friend,‚Äù I thought.

However, could it have been a bit more meaningful? <br>  For a queen, the distance between the current and desired chessboard fields is equal to the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%258F%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D1%2585_%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2">Manhattan distance</a> .  I propose to put out the periscope on the floor of the Karasik and look into the "chess", in which on the starting field there is a person with the idea, on the desired field there is a person with <a href="https://drive.google.com/open%3Fid%3D0B3uyyZN7jEawMkZMa2hGcTdLaTg">1.5 trillions of</a> money.  And we will cut <s>my blunt</s> scalpels from conceptual design, analysis and synthesis of systems.  Let's get quotes from the works of the Russian philosopher, teacher, specialist in the field of organization and management.

      And the project ideas in this tale are: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/897/20b/f7e/89720bf7eef045679bef92df74b91dff.jpg"><br><br>  There is a starting field and a destination field.  Go ahead. <br>  In one aspect, a spherical person in a vacuum can be thought of as an accomplice of a <i>targeted system</i> (CNS).  In the CNS, the objective and subject parts are fundamentally different.  Actually, the central nervous system is built on the basis of subject-object relations.  In our case, the <i>object</i> is money. <br>  The subject in the central nervous system is represented by a system of rules regarding the behavior of the object.  This system reflects the ideas of the abstract subject of the purpose and nature of the use of the object.  In the objects of artificial nature, designed as the central nervous system, the subject part is defined by the <i>goal of</i> control in one form or another, for example, as a set of desired states of the control object.  In the objects of natural nature, considered as the central nervous system, the subject part is represented as a combination of the physical laws of nature that govern the behavior of these objects. <br>  Man is a unique phenomenon.  He and the object of artificial nature, as if to himself invented the goal - to have a million money.  And an object of natural nature, subject to its whims.  And in our case, it has the right to become a representative of the subject. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f3d/e20/2bb/f3de202bbf8d42d3b0edc1656366fefe.png"><br><br>  Since we have a real embodiment of the central nervous system, the representative of the subject has informational status.  This ensures that the subject-person can ‚Äúunderstand‚Äù the behavior of the object-money and ‚Äúdecide‚Äù something about it.  Thanks to the information properties of the human subject in the central nervous system, the mechanisms of reflection of the behavior of the object-money and the development of influences on it are implemented. <br>  What is necessary to reflect on the money and about ourselves to our human subject?  Money as an object behave charmingly.  Being a classical institution of exchange, flow to themselves, turning in the contour of the calculation tools of the modern economy.  They can be obtained by robbing a bank, receiving a salary, or embodying a project idea.  The subject is also good - can grab a bullet during a robbery or die without accumulating a million. <br>  What is the chip?  In modern society, any property, including money, is not unconscious and has specific owners.  They are mostly cultural and do not like when property is taken away from them by force.  In order to preserve civilization and the integrity of the subject's face, it is necessary to ensure access to it (through contracts, alliances, takeovers) by creating or upgrading institutional assets. <br>  The property can be divided into three floors. <br><table border="1"><tbody><tr><th colspan="2" align="center">  The composition of the property </th></tr><tr><td rowspan="3">  Production assets </td><td>  Industrial </td></tr><tr><td>  Distributive </td></tr><tr><td>  Exchange </td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3">  Institutional assets </td><td>  Entrepreneurial </td></tr><tr><td>  Corporate </td></tr><tr><td>  Strategic (public) </td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3">  Project ideas </td><td>  Symbolic </td></tr><tr><td>  Figurative </td></tr><tr><td>  Conceptual </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  Production assets are the owner-controlled concrete elements and fragments of the system of social <i>productive forces</i> . <br>  Institutional assets are owner-controlled specific elements and nodes of the system of its <i>social relations</i> with other owners.  The assets of the owner is the access to the production assets and assets of other owners. <br>  The owner of an successfully implemented institutional project becomes the <i>owner of the social <b>relations</b> system designed by him</i> , through which he reduces the level of institutional <i>costs</i> in society, <i>gains</i> <i>access</i> to the productive assets and assets of other owners needed in the project and creates new products or services through this access. <br><table border="1"><tbody><tr><th colspan="4" align="center">  Enlarged typology of institutional projects </th></tr><tr><td>  Types of property institutions </td><td>  Exchange institutions (market): <br>  1. Capital <br>  <u><b>2. Money</b></u> <br>  3. Right </td><td>  Distribution institutions (state): <br>  1. Law <br>  2. Power <br>  3. Property </td><td>  Assignment Institutions (National): <br>  1.

You can get acquainted with his postulation in detail in Sergey Borisovich Chernyshev <a href="https://drive.google.com/open%3Fid%3D0B3uyyZN7jEawQmVnS05yZkZNMnM">'s</a> book <a href="https://drive.google.com/open%3Fid%3D0B3uyyZN7jEawQmVnS05yZkZNMnM">‚ÄúMeaning‚Äù</a> . <br><br><h4>  Source field tables are different from the last table. </h4><br>  In general, this is all a multidimensional torus ... I can‚Äôt portray it <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10vEXlIvCMV0-yNJEFn1KbugCnn2IaOJjYuERL2rAqUc/edit%3Fusp%3Dsharing">hard</a> enough, so you can see the conceptual model in the form of tables <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10vEXlIvCMV0-yNJEFn1KbugCnn2IaOJjYuERL2rAqUc/edit%3Fusp%3Dsharing">here (converted from Excel)</a> , and the postulation <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BxoxxZWw2yJecGhXSnQxRWZrYlk/edit">here (.pdf)</a> . <br>  You can look at another projection of the torus: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ea1/1d8/0ef/ea11d80efa544c2a9639fd5307b4c1a8.png"><br>  The concepts "function, hierarchy, network, cost, efficiency, information, power, energy" are basic, basic.  In them, and in the empty cells of the table, that layer of the future, those very robots, supertechnologies, relations between people and machines that we still have to come up with.  Inside the blue rectangle is our age.  In the subcell ‚Äúfinancial technologies‚Äù there is a blockchain, and in its sub-sub-subcell, there is bitcoin.  The subcell of a ‚Äúsymbol‚Äù is ‚Äúlanguages‚Äù - natural and artificial. <br><br><h4>  In this, maybe there is some meaning, and what's next? </h4><br>  It is possible to blow your brain to the end and understand how ideas are actually converted into the good existence of human carcasses.  The following options are available: <br>  1. Watch <a href="http://ckp.mipt.ru/material/vvodnaya.php">videos and materials</a> from lectures and project sessions of the MIPT Corporate Entrepreneurship Center, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/property1/">to keep abreast of current events</a> . <br>  2. Read <a href="http://yk1.ru/publications/">publications and books</a> in any order. <br>  3. Take part in the <a href="http://projectsession.ru/">project session</a> . <br>  4.
