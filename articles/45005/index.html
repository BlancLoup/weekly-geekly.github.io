  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Education in Russia: what, why and what to do?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="http://smages.com/i/6b/63/6b63f1d28d5c052756b5ef670d6fc6dd.gif" alt="image" align="left"><br>  I am an ordinary average student of the Russian Federation, which is coming to the climax of schooling.  Since childhood, my parents raised in such a way that I was aware of myself - without a good education it is very difficult to achieve anything worthwhile in life.  I was quite serious about my studies, but I didn‚Äôt come close to the place where the desire to study well borders on ‚Äúbotanism‚Äù.  During the 11 years of study, he managed to change 5 schools, moreover, he started from the provincial school No. 11 in the city of Berdsk and graduated from the Specialized Educational and Scientific Center at the NSU (or simply Phys-Mat School).  I told you all this not so that you would appreciate what a young man I am, but to the fact that I went through different levels of education in our country.  I am absolutely sure that the level of education of citizens is the basis of all the successes of the state and its position in the world arena.  Therefore, I would like the prestige of our educational institutions to be envied by all kinds of Garvadras and Cambridges there, but are we approaching this or are we moving away?  What is now with our education and why is it?  I will try to speculate on this topic with you. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  What happens in primary schools? </h4><br>  In general, how does an ordinary school student relate to studies?  If you ask him about it, he will answer that studying at the moment is the most important thing for him and that he is happy to study, etc.  But if you look at how the same schoolchildren communicate on this topic, but only among themselves?  The phrases ‚Äúwhy do I need it?‚Äù, ‚ÄúHow did it get me!‚Äù, ‚ÄúTo work as soon as possible‚Äù or even more often ‚ÄúI‚Äôll come home and get a job in WoW, at least take a rest from my studies,‚Äù that is, studying for them is like hard labor, as if they go to school not for themselves, but for their parents and teachers.  Such duplicity can probably be explained by the fact that at home parents agitate their child to study well and because of respect for their parents, he agrees with this, but at the same time he wants to spend his time on other hobbies that are more interesting to him, therefore in his atmosphere children are beginning to discuss not physics or literature, but computer games, football, etc. <br><br><h4>  And if the students have already matured? </h4><br>  If the child was in elementary school to study as if it were hard labor, then in high school this feeling will only increase due to the complexity of the material, increasing the number of interests (friendship, love, sport).  Therefore, for him the study will be secondary.  But the parents want their child to receive a good education, so they do everything for this, and more often it manifests itself by giving the child to some supposedly mega-prestigious school or lyceum.  I got into one such mega prestigious high school, but in a different way: I took the entrance examinations.  The exams were quite complicated, I did not pass them, and they said directly to me: ‚ÄúIt's okay, training will cost N rubles.‚Äù  We are not so rich to allow ourselves it, so we decided to try again, but in a less ‚Äúcool‚Äù class.  I passed my exams there.  After one year of study at this high school, I understood who studies there: majors and showers, for whom the school is <b>just a</b> place to communicate with friends. <br><br>  I think that you understood the main idea: the <b>student is not interested in the learning process</b> .

    <h4>  And what does the state do? </h4><br>  For several years, the main reform in the field of education has been the introduction of the Unified State Exam.  Honestly, the benefits of this are rather dubious.  Personally, I don‚Äôt see any benefits from this, except it will be easier for me to take it.  And here are a few drawbacks that came to my mind: <ul><li>  School number 2 of the village of Dubinino will pass the same exam as the SSC Moscow State University.  It may be good for the school (students will study more diligently), but here SUNTs MSU will pass the exam, which is much easier than their regular educational program.  Instead of learning some complicated material, they will spend time on how to choose the answer in the test, when in principle, two of the four answers are correct. </li><li>  It‚Äôs November 19, and I still don‚Äôt know how the USE will give up.  What items can I choose and how will it all happen.  That is, there is an obvious confusion in all this. </li></ul><br>  You can also somewhat pessimistically look at why the Ministry of Defense introduces the Unified State Exam: now all bookstores have a special stand, Preparing for the Unified State Exam or Options of the Unified State Exam;  thin little books, cost 50 rubles each;  I wonder how much they earn on these books? <br><br>  I will not agitate anyone against the USE, but, in my opinion, the best option would be to choose the schools themselves to pass the USE or regular exams. <br><br><h4>  What happened before? </h4><br>  The only criterion by which I can judge what was the level before and what is now is to compare the entrance exams of past and previous years.  I have a book ‚ÄúEntrance examinations in the NSU‚Äù Authors: Belonosov, Fokin.  There are introductory options from 1970 onwards.  Honestly, I was horrified by the tasks of 1970-1993.  After these years there is a frank decline in complexity.  And even now, if we compare 2007 and 2006, we can see this regress. <br><br><h4>  How to improve education? </h4><br>  Everything that will be written below, just like what was written above, is just my opinion. <br>  If I was Minister of Education, what did I do?  Here's what: <ul><li>  Introduced a narrow profile from grade 10 as a maximum.  That is, the student has the right to choose what the extent of his study.  Note that I did not say that he could remove any objects at all, just reduce the depth of the study. </li><li>  In every way to agitate children to learn and hint that the whole future life depends on what knowledge you will get now. </li><li>  Increase the salaries of teachers and introduce compulsory certification of teachers (more on that below) </li><li>  Give schools a choice of what form of exams they should conduct. </li></ul><br>  These are the main modifications that I would make. <br><br><h4>  And what about the teachers? </h4><br>  In our time, there are very few people whose vocation is to teach.  Now the teachers are anyone else.  It is not for nothing that the famous TV show "Our Russia" chose the teacher's communication with her students as one of the plot.  If someone does not know, then the basic idea is that the teacher collects money from students for all sorts of activities or textbooks, etc., but does not teach a damn thing.  Honestly, I think that this is due to the fact that now it is not fashionable to be a teacher: they pay little, there is little chance of improvement, communication with children for whom studying is hard labor.  And the truth is, the one who teaches the future billionaire gets some miserable 10k rubles a month !!!  Unfair, right? <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  I'm scared ... There are less and less smart children on the streets.  Hairy neformalov with American-style sneakers with the words "USA" is becoming more and more.  Scientists are getting smaller.  Ball pen sales managers are becoming more and more.  Our universities in the world ranking are below 300 places.  Will we be able to get out of this and will our government be aware of the danger of the current situation?  Nothing depends on me alone, but maybe you can help me with this, eh?  :) <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/45005/">https://habr.com/ru/post/45005/</a></p>
