      What is the reason, who is to blame, and how can I (try) block any Yandex.Money account for receiving funds through VISA / MasterCard - try to figure it out under the cut <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  What does the error look like </h4><br>  The site has a ‚Äúform-taker‚Äù, as Yandex calls it, with the option to choose - pay with Yandex.Money or pay with a VISA / MasterCard card.  When paying with Yandex.Money, the payment is successful.  When paying by card, the procedure is as follows: <br>  On the Yandex.Money service, on the page complying with the international PCI DSS standard, we are offered to fill in the card data, enter the number, full name, expiration date and CVV code. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Filling card data</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bd4/56e/842/bd456e8427b24e4697a07a89a2b01abd.png"><br></div></div><br>  After filling in all the fields, we are redirected to the bank's website, where you need to enter the code received by SMS <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Payment confirmation on the card‚Äôs acquirer website</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/56a/902/28c/56a90228c16b4f7cb308f765cd57b6e1.png"><br></div></div><br>  Almost instantly comes a text message from the bank <b>about debiting</b> .  But Yandex at this moment gives such a picture: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/467/d0d/033/467d0d033aff461db29be3d1675d4131.png"><br><br><h4>  We understand the reasons </h4><br>  At first, it certainly scares.  The money was written off, and then there was some kind of mistake.  Yes, they ask to repeat the payment. <br>  But after a while, an SMS arrives from the bank to cancel the operation.  Already better, but in general the problem remains. <br>  I try to pay again, as offered.  The result is the same. <br>  I try to pay from the card of another bank.  The result is the same. <br>  I‚Äôm looking for another Yandex.Money account, correcting the ‚Äúacceptor form‚Äù so that the money is sent there.  And voila - the payment from the card comes. <br>  So the problem is in the bill. <br>  Checking limits - not exceeded.  Yes, and Yandex.Money payment comes, it means everything is in order with limits (there were no separate limits for replenishing the wallet from payment cards on the Yandex.Money website) <br><br><h4>  What technical support will tell us </h4><br>  If all else fails, we will write to Yandex.Money technical support.  I describe the problem, send a request from the site, directly on the link on the page ‚ÄúOh!  Something went wrong". <br>  After a couple of days, technical support responds with a question: ‚ÄúIs the problem still relevant?‚Äù <br>  I answer that is relevant. <br>  They propose to generate the ‚Äúform-recipient‚Äù code again and try.  Of course, I did it, and more than once, well, I will do it again.  I create a form, insert it on an empty html-page on the site, try to pay.  The problem persists, as I inform technical support. <br>  And here comes the answer: <br><blockquote>  <b>TP Yandex:</b> Unfortunately, you will no longer be able to accept transfers from bank cards to the purse 4100xxxxxxxxxxx through the form posted on your website.  This is due to the rules of international payment systems prohibiting the receipt of funds from cards on sites of a particular subject.  But you can still replenish your wallet from a bank card without using a special form or accept transfers from electronic wallets. </blockquote><br>  What a twist!  I wonder what's wrong with the theme of the site?  Try to find out. <br><blockquote>  <b>I:</b> Can I accept transfers from bank cards to the purse 4100xxxxxxxxxxxxx on other sites? <br><br>  And is it possible in more detail about the theme of sites?  Where can I see a list of topics, the reception of funds for which is prohibited by the <i>rules of international payment systems</i> ?  I would like to read, so as not to fall under the sanctions backdating. </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  <b>TP Yandex:</b> Unfortunately, the receipt of funds from the cards on the account 4100xxxxxxxxxxx is closed.  This information can be provided by MasterCard and Visa support staff. </blockquote><br><br><h4>  Sites of a particular theme </h4><br>  In general, it was not possible to find out what these ‚Äúsites of a particular subject‚Äù are from Yandex technical support.  How to contact the <i>staff of support services MasterCard and Visa no</i> ideas yet.  In my opinion, the question ‚ÄúWhy can I not replenish my Yandex.Money account using the Yandex.Money form on the Yandex.Money website using a MasterCard card issued by Sberbank, which owns Yandex.Money?‚Äù Will look somewhat silly. <br><br>  There is a suspicion that my Yandex.Money account was ‚Äúlit up‚Äù on the test page of the still not running project of the movie catalog (film descriptions + magnet links to files in the DC hub of the local LAN), without design and anything else that ‚Äúshines‚Äù the Internet.  It is quite possible that Western right holders decided that pirated content was located on the site and did some work on blocking the account. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">How does not run a project with a movie catalog</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Wrap for <a href="http://api.cn.ru/">api.cn.ru</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e03/b9e/9ef/e03b9e9ef7744013a93d388c0660bd08.png"><br></div></div><br>  In favor of the fact that the problem is in this movie catalog, it is said that other Yandex.Money accounts to which funds could be sent from the main site are not blocked, but only the one that ‚Äúlights up‚Äù in the movie catalog is blocked.  (Several accounts were made, since there were several participants in the main project, and the funds received were distributed approximately evenly among the participants. And only one account was blocked) <br>  Against this is the fact that, as seen in the screenshot, the form-taker on the abandoned project is old, without the ability to send money through bank cards.  But who looks at it? <br><br><h4>  Block someone else's wallet </h4><br>  In this connection, an interesting opportunity arises: place a form-taker with the account number of an objectionable person on a ‚Äúspecific subject‚Äù site under your control - and after a while <b>card payments to his account will be blocked</b> unilaterally without explaining the reason.  The address of the ‚Äúsite with a specific theme‚Äù that caused the blocking will not be communicated to the account holder (in any case, I didn‚Äôt find it out) <br>  It is possible that my account was blocked in this way. <br><br><h4>  Is it in the international payment system? </h4><br>  Despite the statements of Yandex.Money technical support that ‚Äúreceiving money from the cards on the account 4100xxxxxxxxxxx is closed‚Äù, in reality, it is possible to replenish the account from the card.  On the Yandex.Money site <a href="">there is a form</a> through which I replenished my account with a bank card.  True, the commission in my case was 4900% (Four thousand nine hundred percent, replenished by 1p, was written off 50p. What, however, was warned in advance) <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">You can still refill, just more expensive</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The form: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/805/a6e/bbb/805a6ebbbf70463a8e17d9e3753f6704.png"><br>  Result: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a0d/8f7/f0b/a0d8f7f0b8364b69a34ebe51f4b49e68.png"><br></div></div><br>  The difference is visible in the purpose of payment.  The ‚Äútransfer from the card‚Äù does not work, but the ‚Äútop-up from the card‚Äù works.  For me, as a philistine, this is the same thing.  The Yandex.Money transfer from the linked card has not been tested, the usual Yandex.Money translation works. <br><br>  In this situation, the most annoying are referrals to VISA / MasterCard support services, despite the fact that the account is blocked in Yandex.Money. <br><br>  In the rules of international payment systems ( <a href="http://visa.com.ru/common/pdf/Visa_Payment_System_Operating_Regulations_Russia.pdf">VISA rules</a> and <a href="http://www.mastercard.com/ru/company/ru/_assets/pdf/Rules.pdf">MasterCard rules</a> ) nothing about the ‚Äúwebsites with a specific theme‚Äù was found by me.  True, the documents are quite voluminous, I ran through them only superficially and could miss something. <br><br>  PS The site that hosted the form-taker engaged in raising funds for the local local network, intended for the purchase of equipment (server, cables, switches) and material support for the administrators of this network, as well as holding various contests with material prizes between network users (gifts - souvenirs, going to the cinema, etc.).  The acceptor form was available only to users of the local network, from their ‚Äúgray‚Äù IP addresses.  It is unlikely, in my opinion, that this site could get into a ‚Äúlist of sites with a specific theme‚Äù (whatever it means).  Although for me the subject remained ‚Äúuncertain‚Äù. <br><br><h4>  Continued.  Reply from TP Yandex </h4><br>  After the article was published on Habr√© (it‚Äôs a pity that only after this, through direct channels it didn‚Äôt work as always) I received an exhaustive answer about the reason for blocking payments to the account via the IPU.  Indeed, the case was in the movie catalog page, which, according to Yandex‚Äôs internal review, ‚Äúcontains links to copyrighted content.‚Äù  Whether a magnet link is a link to content in the direct sense of the word is an open question, opinions on this subject can be very different, and this is a topic for another discussion. <br>  More upset another: it turns out you can really place the form-recipient with someone else's account on the site of the "wrong" orientation, thereby having the opportunity to block the recipient's account on other (all) sites.  One could at least check referer, it seems to me technically possible. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/250927/">https://habr.com/ru/post/250927/</a></p>
