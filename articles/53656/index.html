      We are offered three scenarios to choose from and how three tracks with pointers are drawn in front of Illya Murovtsy - ‚ÄúWin ‚Äã‚Äãa million in a lottery‚Äù, ‚ÄúSteal‚Äù, ‚ÄúEarn by hard work‚Äù.  From the hall suggest that you need to earn. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Well, throughout the rest of the irresponsible life, we are routinely hammered on all sides, that good and well-paid work can only be found after graduating from school with a red diploma, having received a higher education, and preferably not one, having completed as many courses and specialty trainings as possible. a few years as an assistant cleaner in a solid company for the sake of experience.  In general, a long and thorny path. <br><br>  Approximately such concepts were followed by employers at the end of the last century and imposed their game on us. <br><br>  And in fact, many people really studied and study for a tick, for the sake of getting hands on paper that opens the door to a brighter future.  But pieces of paper - they are pieces of paper.  A huge number of certified "specialists", and not waiting for a beautiful life, are now stuck on construction sites, stand in the bazaars and are dependent. <br><br>  In itself, the presence of higher education, as well as the fact of graduation from courses, does not give anything without knowledge and the ability to apply them.  The employment record will not be able to tell about how a person performed his duties at the previous place of work and what quality was what he produced.  Therefore, a competent employer, it does not matter whether you are getting a job or offering remote services, may not even look at your diplomas.  But arrange a real interrogation with passion.  He will ask you to show your skills and abilities, show the projects in which you participated, show yourself. <br><br>  You say no, you don‚Äôt need to show anything, now everything is decided by connections.  And where are the links coming from - will I ask you? <br><br>  ... even from a very young age we are given to understand that only children of parents with connections have connections.  Yes, and the children of rich parents.  And since we're not lucky, we'll have to make connections ourselves.  But how can we make connections if we wrap ourselves up like Gulchatai and do not show ourselves? <br><br>  Show, show and show again.  Any means available.  And do not be afraid of criticism, on the contrary, it is necessary to run up to it more often - it, like any other feedback, will only benefit in the end.  You need to shine on people as much as possible and demonstrate your activities - spreading your work online, blogging, participating in exhibitions and reading reports at seminars, communicating with colleagues and potential clients as often as possible, advertising your services in every possible way.  And never to forget - for a specialist applying for a place in the sun, besides the ability to work well, it is very important to be able to properly present oneself, to season well and expensively to sell. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/53656/">https://habr.com/ru/post/53656/</a></p>
