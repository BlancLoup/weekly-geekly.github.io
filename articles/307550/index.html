Already at the beginning of 2014, a beta version was launched, the launch was scheduled for May 2015 and literally in 6 months only 625 characters of the official address on the website stopped this ambitious project.  Have you left a $ 20 million investment in the concept, the possibility of revival?  Or was the idea not so good? <br><br>  Let's go back to 2013 and see how it was. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Exchange (Deutsche B√∂rse Cloud Exchange (DBCE)) acted as an intermediary between users and sellers (providers) of cloud technologies.  Exchange users could get the missing additional capacity to their cloud servers.  The following instruments were traded on the stock exchange: processor memory (CPU), random access memory (RAM), hard disk space (HDD)

The model of work was a classic exchange for commodity markets (commodities).  The exchange performs all calculations, acts as a standard for the quality of cloud services, and guarantees the execution of transactions.  Clients connect to trading through brokers who act as intermediaries between them and the exchange. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/75a/3de/929/75a3de92964244bba45622b8fbe42e10.png"><br><br>  In the future, it was planned to launch futures and calculate the stock exchange index, expand the trading geography and the list of trading instruments. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5aa/7f2/63b/5aa7f263ba3344f7bb64998229284375.png"><br><br>  To guarantee the quality and safety of services, DBCE, in collaboration with T√úV Rheinland, developed a special testing procedure for suppliers as a prerequisite for market access.  For existing suppliers on the exchange, an annual review of various parameters was conducted, including the performance of the services offered, as well as checking the server storage locations (DPC). <br><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa cloud exchange, as you can see, was generally interesting.  The demand for cloud computing is growing both in the world and in Russia. <br><br>  For example, in March of this year, the largest US bank JP Morgan announced its readiness to transfer part of its services to public cloud.  In April, the same bank published a fairly large-scale report in which it reported that large companies are increasingly transferring corporate load data to public clouds.  Accelerated transition to the clouds and the growing demand for cloud services signals a change in the information policy paradigm at enterprises, representing a serious threat to traditional suppliers of IT solutions.  The findings of the report are based on the results of a survey of more than two hundred IT directors of companies with an annual budget of $ 600 million per year.  Thus, the cumulative budget of the companies participating in the report is over $ 120 billion.  Based on the findings of the report, the bank states that the increase in costs for IT budgets in these companies has decreased from 2-x to 4-x times, and for companies whose IT budget is over $ 2 billion per year, this growth has decreased even more.  Thus, one can observe a very rapid transition of large corporate workloads to cloud solutions.  According to the forecasts of this report, in the next 5 years from 40% to 50% of corporate loads will be concentrated in cloud projects, while now this figure is at 15%.  Russia also does not lag behind world trends.  During the working visit of German Gref to Silicon Valley, it was announced that Sberbank was ready to transfer part of corporate workloads to the cloud due to data center overload in Skolkovo. <br><br>  The demand for the cloud exchange is also confirmed by former users of the exchange.  <a href="http://www.cloudcomputing-insider.de/geschaeftsmodell-der-dbce-soll-wiederkehren-a-522844/">Nicolas R√∂hrs</a> , managing director of Cloud &amp; Heat, a cloud service provider, still finds the business model very useful and especially relevant for the future.  He says that their sales have increased at the end, and even the volume of requested services from the B2B sector has significantly increased. <br><br>  ... But overall demand still turned out to be too small. <br><br>  DBCE failed to gain critical mass for success.  <a href="http://www.cloudcomputing-insider.de/geschaeftsmodell-der-dbce-soll-wiederkehren-a-522844/">Nicolas R√∂hrs</a> is still optimistic about the future of the exchange, he believes that the usability and size of the market provide growth potential for this type of service. <br><br>  We at <a href="http://ruvds.com/">RUVDS</a> also see the growth in demand for cloud services in the world, including Russia.  We think in the future such a cloud exchange has the right to be in this or that form, and we are ready to become its direct participants as a provider of cloud services if it appears on the Moscow Exchange. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/307550/">https://habr.com/ru/post/307550/</a></p>
