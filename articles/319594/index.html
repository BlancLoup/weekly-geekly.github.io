Perhaps their answers will help to identify some general patterns, useful tips that will help many of us. <br><br>  Today our guest is Yevgeny Bevz, one of the software developers (in the field of information security) of Smart-Soft.  In the company since 2010.  Eugene works remotely and lives in Petrozavodsk (Karelia). <a name="habracut"></a>

    <br clear="all"><br clear="all">  <b>What do you do in the company?</b> <br><br>  Development.  The current project is Traffic Inspector Next Generation. <br><br>  <b>One word that best describes how you work:</b> <br><br>  Is always. <br><br>  <b>How many hours a day do you spend on work?</b> <br><br>  I work from nine in the morning to eight to ten in the evening, sometimes longer.  With breaks, of course, without breaks is unrealistic. <br><br>  <b>How many hours do you sleep?</b> <br><br>  I try to sleep for seven hours.  It does not always work, but I try - I still want to live: talk with friends, watch a movie.  I can not sleep at night - the head does not cook.  Power engineers never drink (only if you need a long time to drive). <br><br>  <b>How do you have breakfast?</b> <br><br>  I drink coffee, eat sandwiches.  Coffee is required.  Without it, I do not wake up. <br><br>  <b>What are you doing on the way to work and back?</b> <br><br>  Dozhivyvayu sandwich.  For my way is very short - from the kitchen to the desktop.  I'm working at home.  On the road over long distances I listen to music.  Less often - audiobooks. <br><br>  <b>What kind of todo-manager do you use personally?</b> <br><br>  I have a paper notebook with tear-off leaves on my desk.  This is my todo manager.  He is always in front of his eyes - it is not necessary to open in a separate window.  In the notebook - all sorts of reminders for the day, for today, for example: "do not forget to talk to a journalist." <br><br>  <b>What applications and services can't you do without?</b> <br><br>  Without Sublime text I can not.  This is such a handy notepad type notepad ++.  As I am developing, my main work is editing files: source files, configuration files, scripts, and so on. <br><br>  Manipulate files - create, move, rename - optimally in some file manager.  Midnight Commander, for example.  This is such an old thing.  All kinds of retrogrades like me use them.  Previously, under DOS was Norton Commander, and got used to it then, and the habit is second nature.  Then Far under Windows.  And this one under Linux, Unix and MacOS. <br><br>  I still can‚Äôt do without Git.  Skype is another useful application.  Since our team is distributed, Skype is ‚Äúour everything‚Äù in terms of interaction.  Well, the command line, of course. <br><br>  <b>What kind of task manager / issue tracker / repository do you use in the company?</b> <br><br>  Task Manager - JIRA.  Repository - Git.  Confluence - for quick documentation and storage of information (wiki). <br><br>  <b>What equipment and software do you use at work?</b> <br><br>  I have a MacBook.  Small, 12 inch.  This is the main workhorse.  An external monitor is attached to it - a hefty LG.  And the keyboard.  Also healthy, the most common and quite old - she is probably ten years old already.  Everything suits me.  An old friend - he is better than new ones.  Nout, yes, as soon as he appeared, I immediately climbed over him. <br><br>  Before the poppy was a laptop.  He had to be worked on - MacOS turned on him with all sorts of hacking methods.  But his resource, of course, was not enough.  But he still stands on my desk, sometimes something is spinning on it too.  I like to use two monitors, but I don‚Äôt know how to fasten the second external monitor to the macbook.  Well, a lot of any network boxes at hand. <br><br>  <b>What annoys you most when working?</b> <br><br>  When distracted.  I started my career as a system administrator.  He worked in a hotel, in the clinic - in women's teams: women, they are not silent in principle.  And my job required diving.  Headphones ears do not shut up - the music makes it difficult to concentrate.  At first, very strained.  But over time, I developed a protective mechanism - I learned how to disconnect from an external sound source, not to perceive it.  Passive background now does not bother me.  But, if they fit and shake by the shoulder, this is worse, yes. <br><br>  <b>What professional literature would you recommend?</b> <br><br>  I mostly read reference books.  What I am currently working on, I am reading.  I always have on my desk a reference book ‚ÄúThe Shell Linux and Unix Language‚Äù by David Tansley - a friend gave me a birthday present in some terry year.  I start reading about work strictly as necessary. <br><br>  The task has been set, and I swim in it - I start learning the materiel.  Directly under the task.  Although ... I remember, I really liked the book "Bjorn Straustrup C ++ Programming Language".  Here it, perhaps, I will recommend. <br><br>  <b>What do you prefer: electronic reading rooms or paper books?</b> <br><br>  Of course, paper books.  Rarely, but I read.  Read here is the "Player" of Dostoevsky.  Now Berdyaev took.  Foreign authors ... I don‚Äôt remember something. <br><br>  <b>What technique and why do you use at home?</b> <br><br>  I have a little technology: there are no new models, no pretentious brands.  I'm not a fan of any new-fashioned tech pieces.  I am a very utilitarian user in everyday life.  I need a sound - sometimes I like to listen to the lounge or jazz in the evening - for this I have an old ‚ÄúVega‚Äù amplifier, which is already thirty years old, and ‚ÄúRadio engineering‚Äù speakers. <br><br>  I brew coffee in the Turk - I do not have any capsule coffee machines.  The latter requires too many extra gestures: choose a capsule, charge, then wash it all.  And I poured three spoons into the Turk, threw in spices - then I rinsed the Turk.  Everything.  Nothing extra, and coffee is better.  I need the minimum necessary functionality. <br><br>  I don't have a TV either.  There is a twenty-three-inch monitor, to which a media player is connected, with IP television on it.  And I watch him very rarely. <br><br>  <b>New Sherlock?</b> <br><br>  No, I do not watch.  I do not perceive any other, except Livanov. <br><br>  There are also two vehicles from the vehicle - the Skoda and the Chinese pickup for the forest.  Several times a year I have to go to the village in the Vologda region, and there are sometimes bad roads.  Pickup - it is actually a jeep, copes well, and it is not a pity. <br><br>  <b>What do you listen when you work?</b> <br><br>  Nothing.  Music interferes. <br><br>  <b>Which life hack allows you to be more efficient?</b> <br><br>  If I had known this, I would have been more effective.  Although ... Turk with good coffee.  To wake up. <br><br>  <b>What professional advice can you give yourself in the future?</b> <br><br>  Do not spray.  Filter projects.  Do not do what you do not like.  Time is a limited resource.  His whole (and even more) in any way you spend on work.  Let at least the work will be interesting. <br><br>  <b>You have traveled a serious path.</b>  <b>And someone is right at the beginning.</b>  <b>What would you recommend to a person trying to go the same way?</b> <br><br>  Do not be afraid to do unknown things.  It is adventurous, driving and almost always promising.  And strive not to lose what happens.  It‚Äôs a pity when an interesting project dies due to someone‚Äôs stupidity, a great team is falling apart.  Really so sorry.  This happened to me. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/319594/">https://habr.com/ru/post/319594/</a></p>
