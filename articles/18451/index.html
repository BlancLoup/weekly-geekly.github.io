  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Meebo repeater</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="http://irrrka.nm.ru/meebo_repeater.jpg" alt="meebo repeater" title="meebo repeater"><br><br>  Surely, many people faced at work with a situation where "evil" admins closed off any opportunity to use all sorts of instant messengers, in particular, the widely popular Asya.  ‚ÄúHa,‚Äù you exclaim, ‚ÄúJabber rules!‚Äù <a name="habracut"></a>  Yes, but in this barrel of honey there is a pair of fly in the ointment.  First of all, if you are so impressed to use precisely Asya (MSN, AIM, etc.) - well, you have a lot of contacts there!  - then you have to look for a specific Jabber-to-ICQ gate (MSN, AIM, etc.), and well-known servers of this kind are usually also blocked (we take the case of a special conspiracy policy) or can be blocked, as soon as the admin crawls.  Secondly, if you wish to put your own Jabber-server, you will find that with normal servers under Windows - trouble.  They are either paid or buggy, difficult to install and configure ... Thirdly, you can have friends from different networks, and what - to set your own gate for each?  Is it too much for a poor office plankton, who just wants to exchange a few words with friends, tired of righteous works?  =) A niksovy server, too, not everyone had a chance at hand. <br><br>  In general, it was precisely this problem that a friend of mine encountered when he switched to a new job.  All his contacts were in ICQ, and ICQ wasn‚Äôt available from work at all.  He shared his problem with me, and we began to search for alternatives.  And we found her! <br>  Surely, many people know the meebo.com service that has quickly gained popularity and serves as a browser gate in as many as six IM networks.  Unfortunately, the service itself at work for my friend was also closed, but after digging properly on the meebo website, we discovered a brilliant thing ‚Äî the <a href="">meebo repeater</a> .  This program is a small executable that does not require any installation.  When launched, it looks at your IP itself, tests the connection, configures UPnP, and then sits on ports 80 and 443 (HTTP and HTTPS, respectively), redirecting packets from users connecting via SSL to meebo.com itself (which is what its name says).  The program has almost no settings, but if you wish, you can change the default ports to others.

    <img src="http://irrrka.nm.ru/meebo_port_mapping.jpg" alt="meebo repeater port mapping" title="meebo repeater port mapping"><br><br>  It follows that everyone can start a meebo repeater at home, and from work type <strong><a href="https://xn--_ip--43deiwj3im9e/">your_IP-address</a></strong> in the browser and be on meebo.com!  So, the meebo repeater allows you to effortlessly fuck your own gate on any of the six networks provided by the meebo.com portal. <br><br>  Users who are behind the router will have a bit more difficulty - they will need to configure the mapping port in their router.  The creators of the meebo repeater have taken care to create a step-by-step description for those who do not know how to do this (see <a href="http://blog.meebo.com/%3Fpage_id%3D140">this page</a> ). <br><br>  If you have a dynamic address, so much the better, it will be harder to ban =) But not everyone wants to remember every morning their own IP address that has changed once again.  Owners of such addresses can be advised of the <a href="https://www.dyndns.com/">DynDNS</a> service - just register in it and install the DynDNS Updater program that exists in incarnations for various platforms, which will constantly associate your IP with a free domain name. <br><br><img src="http://irrrka.nm.ru/dyndns.jpg" alt="DynDNS Updater" title="DynDNS Updater"><br><br>  By the way, the owners of some modern routers have this service right in the firmware, which allows you to do without any programs, but you still have to register. <br><br>  Repeater, running on my computer, has been successfully tested in several organizations with particularly strict restrictions, and has successfully passed the test everywhere, working without complaints so far.  Let's see if he will pass the test of time =) <br>  Enjoy using!  I hope someone will come in handy. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/18451/">https://habr.com/ru/post/18451/</a></p>
