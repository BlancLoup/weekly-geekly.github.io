  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Chinese device, unpacking.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The third day I decided to buy a Chinese devaysik for myself on ebay, not something that would be very necessary, just the combination of price and characteristics is very interesting.  As a result, curiosity won out, looked around a bit and stopped at one of the telephones, ordered it and took it today at the post office ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To begin with, the box was generally from another device and had nothing to do with the phone, which already alerted. <br>  <b>Here is the content of the box:</b> <br><img src="http://img509.imageshack.us/img509/2565/dsc00141tc4.jpg" alt="Box contents"><br>  <b>What was found inside:</b> <br><ul><li>  Package with pimples !!! </li><li>  The apparatus itself </li><li>  Battery (2 pieces) </li><li>  Charger </li><li>  Headset </li><li>  1 Gb microSD card </li><li>  User smanul - why is it so called yet a riddle. </li></ul><br>  <b>Now in order:</b> <br>  <i>The bag with pimples</i> is one of the most useful devices of this delivery.  He showed high compatibility with me and was almost immediately spent.  Good but not enough :( <br><br>  <i>The device itself</i> - It was wrapped in the same package, in the box there were no special divisions into sections, everything was <s>lying</s> was is.  The device looks like a phone, I will describe in more detail below. <br><br>  <i>The battery</i> - which could not please such gizmos in the box was as much as two for 1500 mAh.

      <i>Charger</i> - made in the form of a box with a USB connector.  The <s>USB-miniUSB</s> cable of an incomprehensible Chinese standard was separate, seemingly somewhat reminiscent of a mini USB, but in fact it was not at all, so that it is not known how to charge the device when it was lost. <br><br>  <i>Headset</i> - the headset as a headset, all is connected to the same incomprehensible connector, stereo or mono did not check. <br><br>  <i>User smanul</i> is a very interesting little book, which was supposed to be a manual, but it seems that the Chinese have their own opinion. <br><br><br>  <b>Now more about the device:</b> <br><br>  <b>Characteristics of the device:</b> <br><ul><li>  2.8 inch screen </li><li>  Support for 2 simultaneous sim cards (gsm) </li><li>  Touch screen </li><li>  Naturally different gprs, mms </li><li>  Camera 1.3 </li><li>  From blue tooth communications </li><li>  MicroSD card support </li><li>  FM radio </li><li>  Does not keep applications in Java </li></ul><br><br><img src="http://img385.imageshack.us/img385/2639/dsc00139sj3.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://img509.imageshack.us/img509/2096/dsc00140bo3.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://img201.imageshack.us/img201/2876/dsc00142xe5.jpg" alt="image"><br>  In principle, it is assembled quite well, basically nothing creaks and does not fall off, which pleases indescribably.  After installing the battery, it even turned on, but it should be noted that the back cover opens pretty tight.  When turned on, the device stunned me and several people nearby and I am still under the effect.  Simply, everything that can only be turned on in the phone is already turned on and set to the maximum, which is a bit unusual at first.  After customizing yourself, calibrating the stylus and turning off all unnecessary work, you can even get used to managing, which is on an average level, a bit like standard operating systems of Samsung-type phones of the middle class.  The sound and camera are the same level as the average phone.  We were pleased only with the shortcut keys at the bottom of the touchscreen and sesor control.  The buttons are made in 4 columns and 3 rows, which is inconvenient at the start of the acky.  I think it's a good idea to dial a number on the on-screen keyboard in the winter, and it is also terribly convenient to type an SMS on an alphabetic keyboard, it is very close to the qwerty format, I personally find it much more convenient than T9. <br><br>  I didn‚Äôt dig into the functions, but in principle there is everything: games, music and video players, audio and video recording, various e-book readers, calendars, etc.  things.  What else is pleased that you can set up to 4 alarm clocks, which will help in the morning awakening.  Good organizer and calendar.  From Russian localization refused immediately, because  It is made in the best Chinese traditions. <br><br>  In general, you can estimate the device by 3.5 points on a five-point scale, taking into account all Chinese lapses.  The main disadvantage is the lack of support for applications on Java since  The OS does not hold them, I would say it is worthwhile to position it on a regular user not experienced with Internet technologies and software.  It costs, by the way, 2.7 kilorubl along with delivery, which is undoubtedly nice for these functions, since  There is absolutely everything you need for the owner of the phone. <br><br><br>  Here you can familiarize yourself with similar products of Chinese telephone construction. <br><br>  And after a couple of links on similar topics: <br>  <a href="http://narod.ru/disk/4469114000/China-rus.rar.html">Program</a> for working with contacts via usb / bluetooth for devices with such an operating system.
