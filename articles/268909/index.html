We integrate amoCRM, telephony and cellular communication</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> As one of our partners says, ‚ÄúIt is important to be not the first, it is important to be successful.‚Äù  So we did not strive to invent electric cars that run on solar energy, but for several years patiently and consistently developed the next SaaS, a virtual IP PBX, of which more than a dozen already exist.  Although the market is non-rubber - someone comes, someone leaves - but IT is developing at such a rapid pace, so far there are plenty of unoccupied niches and it is enough to show diligence and creativity, technical literacy and be sure to get some customers, and if you work correctly, more and gradually increase the customer base until the business is profitable.  What is happening to us now.  In this blog, we would like to share our, if not know-how, then some specific developments that allow us to confidently move forward and develop the service.  Some time ago, having experienced the IT pulse of the decade, we decided that we would develop not just a cloud PBX, but a PBX with advanced integration with other integrated circuits, which is slightly lower. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/51a/f46/14a/51af4614a35d473ca145c6ddb18e14fd.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The PBX code is based on an open platform, widely known in the professional environment.  Genetically, our <a href="http://zeonpbx.ru/">ZEON PBX</a> is Asterisk's great-grandson and unites communication core with his great-grandfather.  The interface, statistics modules, the entire control shell, and much more are written from scratch by our developers.  At the end of 2014, at the next anniversary production and corporate meeting, realizing that the development, which spent 350 years of hard work, sweat and blood of developers Oleg and Sergey, the nerves of product manager Nastya and businessman Timur, we decided what we would do the ‚Äúnot like all‚Äù service, which means we will explore hitherto unexplored depths of APIs, integrations and connectors.  Long live cloud PBX, integrated with all appliances from MediaMarkt and M-Video. <br><br>  With what and how to integrate it was decided in almost 3 minutes: all trends on the surface:

      <b>Trend One</b> <br><br>  Users more and more often use CRM in conjunction with telephony in their business processes, and in order to understand this, it is enough to spend a couple of hours studying the circulation of customers, which we carefully collect and analyze.  We will integrate with the leaders of the cloud CRM market, at the same time we will rework the API and give customers the opportunity to independently integrate with what they wish.  Solved and recorded in Trello. <br><br>  <b>Trend Two</b> <br><br>  Mobile communications integrated with CRM and office PBX.  Very fashionable and booming trend.  About a year ago, the highly modified FMC SIM cards of one of the mobile workers appeared on the market and we immediately ran to partner with them, realizing that the integration of corporate cellular communications, CRM and PBX is a killer feature, with which we will tear the market to shreds hours <br><br>  This picture appeared on our Kanban board: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d1f/c1c/430/d1fc1c4307b34cd3b7ececf4ba5f276a.jpeg"><br><br>  Fashionable FMC sim cards are configured in PBXs as ordinary office IP phones (technologically, this is not as difficult as it seems) and our Zeon absolutely sincerely thinks that SIMs are ordinary sip devices with a login and password and a short internal number.  Since Zeon thinks that way (and this is how it really is), Simka becomes part of the company's telephone network with a short number, call recording and statistics.  Anyone who dials the short number of Nastya's product from a SIM card will go to the office in the same way as from an office phone.  At the same time, for outgoing calls from a SIM card, the common company number will be substituted, not the mobile number.  SIM-cards simply do not have a mobile number: from the point of view of PBX logic, SIM-cards are ordinary office phones. <br><br>  Fine.  Half done.  The integration with mobile communication was launched in a couple of weeks, but ‚Äúonly this is not enough‚Äù: without integration with CRM, the scheme does not look like rocket science.  We will integrate with CRM so that company executives not only enjoy the triumph of technology and listen to conversations from mobiles and see all the statistics of cellular calls of the main seller Timur.  We want the highly respected client bosses to also get a powerful tool for controlling everything related to telephony, see the statistics of all employee‚Äôs office and mobile calls on transaction cards, listen to customer conversations and change irresponsible transactions responsible for the transaction.  We do. <br><br>  Who is the most prestigious among CRM managers, with a well-described API, a friendly team and an attractive affiliate program?  We suspect that amoCRM, which in recent times has begun to gather practically stadiums at partner get-togethers, is rattling all over the solar system.  Ok, amoCRM, we go to you.  Two technology giants must agree. <br><br>  Friendship technology giants: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/292/14a/440/29214a44097446d69829a357f1a4cdd2.jpeg"><br><br>  We are writing a connector for integration with AMO, on our side we provide transmission via the API of all the statistics of conversations - both from office and mobile - and the communication history of all employees without exception is now attached to the transaction card in amoCRM.  Timur and Nastya have no chances to mislead the manager, all their conversations are visible and easily found by searching in CRM.  Potential customers are a little strained in anticipation of the digital revolution, about the need for which IT pros colleagues from San Jose have spoken so much.  In the "Integration" section amoCRM our connector appeared: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/226/4c3/e3b/2264c3e3bb3043d7acfffcea04f60d70.jpeg"><br><br>  Surprisingly, he didn‚Äôt have to touch Zeon himself.  The PBX interface remained unchanged, the developers conjured with the core.  From the point of view of the logic of the PBX, nothing has changed - SIMs work like ordinary phones, which means that the next mobile employee starts up as easily as any other extension in the system - we indicate the short number, personal data, email, gender, age, marital status and nationality . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c52/f50/e5d/c52f50e5d5b34cf299975bf49c8aac21.jpeg"><br><br>  Integration has happened, amoCRM is absolutely convinced that calls from mobile are calls from regular phones and honestly shows them in the event tape as regular calls from fixed numbers.  In the screenshot below, the number "45" is not a fixed number of manager Sergey, this is his short mobile number.  Sergey is a deeply decent person and honestly fulfills the instructions of the leadership.  His active chimes with a potential client, while Sergei ran to the subway, got into the CRM event feed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/21f/b32/5c8/21fb325c856c46858cd3c6eebc23f73a.jpeg"><br><br>  The tape of events is transient and, with the active work of the sellers, is quickly updated, displaying more and more new beats of the company's emaciated heart, so we want to see calls not just in the tape of events, but also in each specific card for any selected period. <br><br>  We filter, we form, we create reports and we look at the card of the transaction on each of clients. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bd8/d7a/45a/bd8d7a45a143488ca438b5f44b44428a.jpeg"><br><br>  The card also shows everything.  The player with the number "45" continues to call, but already when leaving the subway.  Apparently, the integration of CRM, mobile communications and office PBX greatly added enthusiasm and Sergey deeply hopes to get an option in the business of the future technology giant. <br><br>  What we get in the end: at first glance, it is in itself a curious integration of cloud PBX and CRM.  This bundle gives the drive to any business that thinks about optimization and control.  Integration with corporate cellular communication significantly enhances the drive: the weak point of any company with a large number of mobile employees, couriers, drivers and hyperactive managers and negotiators is the lack of control over their movements and activities.  Now there is such control, sims work in conjunction with all other phones and all calls are under control. <br><br>  Our next steps are the development of additional killer features, so that our blue connector in amoCRM honestly worked out the efforts spent on its creation, however, honestly, the efforts were not so much spent, amoCRM perfectly and almost seamlessly integrated with ZEON PBX . <br><br>  We will work to think, work, be creative and stay awake at night. <br><br>  <i>Instead of an afterword</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Having developed our ZEON and integrating it with mobile communications and CRM, we, the company <a href="http://iptelefon.su/">Iptelefon</a> , decided to leave the <a href="http://iptelefon.su/">gloom</a> of night vigils in the console of Asterisk and went, as they say, to the people.</i>  <i>The plans for the further development of the product, all kinds of announcements and promotion, regular updating of the blog here on Habr√©.</i>  <i>We are ready to share with the community all our experiences, talk about found solutions and life hacking.</i>  <i>Steps in this direction are already being taken.</i>  <i>The nationwide exhibition of the achievements of the national IT economy, the first in our fascinating integration history, died down in the spring and we took part in it.</i>  <i>The laurels of Steve Jobs haunt us too.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/268909/">https://habr.com/ru/post/268909/</a></p>
