His idea is difficult for perception "on the fly", so first I chew it with examples.  And then - I will try to focus on habrovchan this particular startup. <br><br>  I will need 10 minutes of your time.  Attention please. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ‚ÄúWhat unites Christopher Columbus, Thomas Edison and Father Theodore from the Twelve Chairs?  All three needed money to discover America, invent a phonograph and build a candle factory, ‚ÄùKommersant writes. Money <a href="http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx%3FDocsID%3D908882">in a recent article</a> .  And he gives a selection of several examples of how funds are collected for such needs in the modern world. <br><br>  The <a href="http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com/">One Million Dollars Page</a> project, where the author, who sold each pixel of his site for a dollar, actually collected a million in a couple of months.  Fraudulent ‚ÄúNigerian letters‚Äù with requests to give money for a bribe or other operation and a promise of a share in the business project of the century.  The owner of the house rabbit Toby, who threatened to cook and eat his pet, if site visitors did not collect him $ 50,000 and did collect half, until the team <a href="http://bored.com/">bored.com</a> intervened.  The project Artistshare, on which participants can contribute from $ 1 thousand to $ 18 thousand for the creative exercises of an artist, having received in exchange for this access to a mass of materials, including unique ones.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe band Radiohead, which posted the latest album in free access, eventually received voluntary donations of an average of ¬£ 4 per person.  These are all examples of successful and high-profile fundraising through the Internet.

      This fundraising model is called ‚Äúcrowdfunding‚Äù.  Through crowdfunding, many major areas are funded: investigative journalism, commercial research, social projects like ‚Äúhelping children‚Äù.  Crowdfunding is a way to grow Wikipedia and its Wikimedia foundation, a way to raise money from Kononenko for the Vladimir.Vladimirovich project.  The Cambrian House project, like the <a href="http://b-generator.ru/">b-generator.ru</a> project, working in the ‚Äúpeople's IPO‚Äù format and ensuring the collection of micro-investments for the implementation of promising ideas of its participants, also essentially use this method. <br><br>  There are disappointments.  The same Mozilla Firefox and Abi Word that could not make donationware work, or Stephen King, who experimentally decided to write a novel ‚Äúin real time,‚Äù but quickly lost interest in such a scheme.  Here, probably, a lot depends on the idea: film critic Sergey Kudryavtsev saved only $ 4,000 through Learn to release a collection of reviews, and the creators of the film ‚ÄúThe Witches of Blair‚Äù were able to collect $ 30,000 through acquaintances. The film later brought more than $ 200 million at the box office would bring a collection of reviews? <br><br>  However, ‚Äúthe situation on the market and the opinion of experts suggest that crowdfunding has a bright future.  However, one should not hope for a quick achievement of super-results - the inertia of misunderstanding and mistrust is high.  But to underestimate the power of the phenomenon is also impossible. ‚Äù- Kommersant writes.  That's fine.  That's good. <br><br>  And now about the startup itself - <a href="http://www.nakedbusiness.ru/%25D0%25BE-%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5/about/">NakedBusiness.ru</a> . <br><br>  ( <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DeSpqfXabSIE">VIDEO PRESENTATION</a> ) <br><br>  A young 27-year-old Ural businessman Sergey Kosolapov ( <a href="http://carme.ru/">Carme.ru</a> ) decided on a unique experiment: opening his new business, he will provide this process with absolute publicity, telling in real time about his successes and problems, financial and other costs.  The general idea is quite reasonable and well balanced: openness will attract interest to the project and help it develop faster, and the observers themselves will get quite valuable practical experience. <br><br>  As a business, Kosolapov chose the creation of a co-working office, a not very intelligible, but relevant, direction.  Discernment will help him gain the co-working office ‚ÄúTower‚Äù, which supported the idea and donated funds sufficient to create start-up capital. <br><br>  The risk of a startup is to bet on the financial activity of the audience: Sergey expects to raise funds according to the model described above, collecting donations from curious visitors of Runet.  However, according to Kommersant‚Äôs interpretation, ‚Äúthe bright future of crowdfunding‚Äù, the social focus of the co-working business idea and the courage and openness of Kosolapov will overwhelm the ‚Äúinertia of misunderstanding and mistrust‚Äù. <br><br>  God grant that. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/30546/">https://habr.com/ru/post/30546/</a></p>
