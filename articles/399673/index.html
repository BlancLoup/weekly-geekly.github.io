  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Always in the lead: a consolidated review of Russian DVRs AdvoCam</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello!  This article will discuss four car DVRs from <a href="http://advocam.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dtext%26utm_campaign%3Dadvocam">AdvoCam</a> : FD One, FD8 Black GPS, FD8 Red II (GPS + GLONASS) and FD8 Gold GPS.  These devices have several key features that distinguish them favorably against the background of the bulk of the ‚Äúblack boxes‚Äù sold in Russia.  First of all, it is a high quality of assembly, components and, as a result, high video recording.  It is also worth noting the convenient thoughtful management and wide functionality.  Finally, the originality is captivating: AdvoCam does not buy ready-made recorders from Chinese manufacturers, as the vast majority of brands do, and it designs its own devices.  Responsible for this are Russian engineers with 20 years of experience in the development of professional video surveillance systems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/710/a92/6d2/710a926d293d444aa99361dbb40ddd1d.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  AdvoCam <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/smartgadget/blog/229489/">has its own production</a> (the city of Alexandrov, Vladimir region), where the development, test build, and pre-production testing of the issued autoregions takes place.  For example, here they check how gadgets will endure the harsh operating conditions in Russia.  Devices are tested on vibrostands (imitating our far from ideal roads) and in temperature chambers.  AdvoCam recorders can operate at temperatures from -35 to +50 degrees Celsius.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2be/6bc/2b1/2be6bc2b16cf4bb88c92cfbe2425c089.jpeg"><br><br>  It is unlikely that any Chinese device is able to withstand such temperatures, and its life (or at least the life of its attachment) is likely to be short from shaking our potholes.  It is worth noting that AdvoCam does not produce very cheap registrars, the most affordable model of this brand is estimated at about 5 thousand rubles.  It is understandable, you can not make a high-quality device, which will cost only a couple of thousand - it will most likely be a ticked recorder.  Maybe he will shoot a video, but terrible.  It may be constantly "hang" and disconnect, or fall apart.  And then all at once.  Who needs this ‚Äúhandicraft‚Äù?  Neither the buyer nor the normal brand - reputation is more expensive. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d96/7b5/eb5/d967b5eb55a04b8aa29f73c26e65a482.jpeg"><br><br>  Speaking of reputation.  Since 2014, AdvoCam has continuously ranked among the top 3 most popular brands of DVRs in Russia.  This means that the buyer votes with a ruble for high-quality and functional devices, tired of the cheap but unreliable Chinese "slag". <br><br>  Well, let's proceed to the consideration of specific models.  And let's start with the most affordable - AdvoCam-FD One for 4,900 rubles.  Such a low (by the standards of quality recorders) prices were achieved due to the almost complete absence of additional options: in this model there is neither GPS nor speedcam.  There is not even LDWS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/292/1d5/f4a/2921d5f4ab154401b306f68ee1108817.jpeg"><br><br>  There is only a G-sensor, which automatically protects the video from being overwritten in the event of a trigger (shock, sudden braking, reversal, etc.).  The low price did not affect the quality of the video, AdvoCam-FD One easily bypasses the recorders of other brands in this price range.  Moreover, in terms of recording quality, this model is comparable to devices that cost almost twice as much - 7-8 thousand rubles. <br>  The AdvoCam-FD One uses a high-aperture CMOS-matrix with a large physical pixel size - 3x3 micrometers, the size of the matrix itself is 1 / 2.7 ‚Äù, and the resolution is 2 Mp.  The following picture clearly shows why 2-megapixel CMOS-matrix better than 4-or 5-megapixel: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/255/e1c/adf/255e1cadfa9149aebc607b11d8757bd6.jpeg"><br><br>  The larger physical size of the matrix indicates that each pixel receives a greater amount of light, that is, in conditions of insufficient illumination, the picture remains clear and distinct. <br><br>  AdvoCam-FD One records video at a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels at a frequency of 30 fps.  The lens of the recorder consists of 5 lenses made of professional optical coated glass.  The viewing angle is 150 degrees diagonal.  That is, a sufficient amount of information gets into the frame (three lanes and a roadside), but the image is not bent on the sides.  The recording quality is high, especially if you remember the cost of this model.  During the day, license plates of cars are readable at a distance of up to 15 meters, which is quite good.  At night, readability of numbers in a straight line - 8-10 meters.  This, of course, is not the maximum performance, but quite a decent level for a segment of 5 thousand rubles - most competitors with a similar price tag give up to 12 meters during the day and 5 meters at night. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/itBlcUFmeto" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a83/94a/c29/a8394ac29dd745178fd18f58b8e23241.jpeg"><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v0J599pxX3g" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/40d/93e/6a4/40d93e6a4ef146db99f8dff831f29ba6.jpeg"><br><br>  AdvoCam-FD One is equipped with a 550 mAh battery, and a full charge lasts about 40 minutes of shooting without an external power source.  Considering that the average autoreg works for about 5-10 minutes without recharging, this is a very solid indicator.  You can even say a record value.  And not only among registrars with a price tag of 5-7 thousand rubles, but also among much more expensive models - rarely, who from the manufacturers equips their products with a battery for more than 15-20 minutes of the "autonomous". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9a6/b5f/6e2/9a6b5f6e20d3452d84c89813f16dc556.jpeg"><br><br>  Another feature of AdvoCam-FD One is the ability to work as a webcam for a personal computer.  All that is needed for this is to connect the recorder to the PC.  A useful feature, especially if you consider that a normal 2-megapixel ‚Äúwebcam‚Äù will cost you about 4 thousand rubles, and here you get 499 at once both the recorder and the webcam. <br><br>  In general, AdvoCam-FD One deserves the honorary title of the <b><u>most thoughtful budget recorder of the sample of the end of 2016</u></b> .  Which is also capable of recording video at the level of models at the price of 7-8 thousand rubles. <br><br>  The second model we are considering is the AdvoCam-FD8 Black GPS, which is estimated at 6,500 rubles.  This unit also belongs to the budget class, however, in terms of the quality of shooting, it is not inferior to more expensive models.  The AdvoCam-FD8 Black GPS uses the Aptina 3-megapixel CMOS-matrix (1/3 ‚Äù), specially designed for professional video surveillance systems.  The lens here also consists of 5 lenses made from professional optical optical glass.  The final cost of the device was slightly reduced due to a cheaper (but still quite productive) processor - Novatek is used in the model, while Ambarella solutions are used in the more expensive AdvoCam DVRs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/088/647/4a1/0886474a16d442c9b4625d96aff4d201.jpeg"><br><br>  At the output we have a video of very high quality with a maximum resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels with a frequency of 30 fps.  The picture is bright, clear and detailed.  And this also applies to night photography, which is not what you expect from a device with such a price. <br><br>  Of the interesting additional features, you can highlight the presence of a GPS receiver, which is used to determine the current coordinates and speed of the car.  This can be useful in the event of an incident after a traffic accident. <br><br>  On the build quality AdvoCam-FD8 Black GPS did not save, and it pleases.  However, the package does not include a memory card (which is placed in a box with more expensive AdvoCam recorders).  So you have to buy this accessory yourself.  Well, this is not at all scary, since cards today are not much more expensive than a stick of sausage.  Thus, in AdvoCam-FD8 Black GPS saved on trifles, without affecting the basic parameters of the device, such as recording quality, build quality, functionality, etc. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zkCMD8IhDjM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3e0/4fa/0c9/3e04fa0c92da486d90a9dea3e3e8cac8.jpeg"><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7U27AuS3vZ4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ad9/292/5df/ad92925dff6840638047e72bb160e73d.jpeg"><br><br>  The third registrar in question is AdvoCam-FD8 Red II (GPS + GLONASS).  Red Advokam second generation.  The model is estimated at 8,600 rubles, that is, you can‚Äôt call it a budget already - this is already a normal middle class! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6fd/0bc/f03/6fd0bcf03de2417f847d3943b2a53940.jpeg"><br><br>  The main difference between AdvoCam-FD8 Red II (GPS + GLONASS) from the two previous models is video recording at the maximum resolution of Super Full HD for today, that is 2304 x 1296 pixels.  The device uses a 4-megapixel matrix from the American company OmniVision, which allows you to record video in Super Full HD or Full HD (1920 x 1080 pixels), but in HDR mode.  The latter mode aligns the brightness in the frame, eliminating unnecessarily lightened or unnecessarily darkened areas.  In addition, in the HDR mode, the "flare" of numbers on the machines is noticeably reduced when only a white rectangle without numbers and letters is visible on the record.  Also worth noting is a 6-lens lens made of professional coated glass and a powerful processor of the latest generation - Ambarella A7.  In general, here we have the most current and modern stuffing. <br><br>  AdvoCam-FD8 Red II (GPS + GLONASS) performed well in Super Full HD resolution.  The video shows all the small details, and the digital ‚Äúporridge‚Äù is missing as a class.  Car license plates are readable at almost the maximum distance for DVRs - 17-20 meters during the day and up to 15 meters at night.  This level is noticeably higher than the average for the reg market.  Ordinary Chinese models "give out to the mountain" during the day - about 15 meters, at night - no more than 10-12 meters. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h7SICvPu-vA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/864/9e2/17e/8649e217e4f740cbba386b2876a8fd7f.jpeg"><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OIJN3bvRtbI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c0b/1fd/e51/c0b1fde51caa4782b7606f5df704c66b.jpeg"><br><br>  AdvoCam-FD8 Red II (GPS + GLONASS) supports memory cards up to 128 GB.  This is a rarity for DVRs - usually no more than 32 GB.  Considering that this AdvoCam model records video in Super Full HD, this option is very useful - a 128GB flash drive can fit about 16 hours of uninterrupted video in this resolution.  It is worth noting that AdvoCam-FD8 Red II (GPS + GLONASS) has its own internal memory of 256 MB.  In the event of an accident on it, you can copy the "emergency" fragment of video up to two minutes. <br><br>  It should be clarified that AdvoCam-FD8 Red II (GPS + GLONASS) replaced the AdvoCam-FD8 Profi-GPS Red model.  It was one of the most popular video recorders in 2015.  The novelty received a more modern matrix (which was already mentioned above), as well as a dual-system satellite navigation module - GPS + GLONASS (the predecessor worked only with GPS).  Support for two satellite systems provides a faster ‚Äúcold start‚Äù, more accurate determination of coordinates and more confident signal reception in dense urban areas or, for example, when passing through tunnels. <br><br>  Using the built-in GPS + GLONASS module in AdvoCam-FD8 Red II (GPS + GLONASS), you can record a car‚Äôs motion track and impose a speed stamp on the video (and you can set the maximum displayed threshold - so as not to fix your own violation).  Plus, a base with the coordinates of speed cameras is stored in the device‚Äôs memory.  When approaching the latter, the registrar will warn you in advance.  The base is updated regularly, that is, it contains current information about speed cameras. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/91c/844/97d/91c84497d2294a7dbb1a48f351497f20.jpeg"><br><br>  Another interesting feature of AdvoCam-FD8 Red II (GPS + GLONASS) is a lane control system called LDWS.  This option is designed to reduce the number of accidents that have occurred due to the fault of a dormant or distracted driver.  So, when shifting to the next lane, the device will emit a loud beep, which is simply impossible not to hear (unless, of course, you drive in headphones).  However, it should be clarified that in order for LDWS to work correctly, good road markings and sufficient illumination are needed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0f3/39e/178/0f339e178d514948a0833a281b15ba64.jpeg"><br><br>  The fourth (and last for today) model is AdvoCam-FD8 Gold GPS.  Golden Advokam!  This is the flagship registrar of the AdvoCam line, which is estimated at 12,500 rubles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3fb/76a/301/3fb76a30107e4c2788554398925047ef.jpeg"><br><br>  A feature of the device is the video recording in the maximum resolution of Super Full HD (2304 x 1296 pixels) with a frequency of 30 fps for today among all recorders.  Or in Full HD (1920 x 1080 pixels), but with a frequency of 60 fps.  In the latter case, the clarity and sharpness of the video noticeably increases when driving at high speed.  The possibility of recording in HDR mode is also provided. <br><br>  The AdvoCam-FD8 Gold GPS uses Ambarella's flagship processor model, the Ambarella A7LA70.  The recorder matrix has a resolution of 4 megapixels, this is the American OmniVision OV4689.  The lens consists of six lenses made of high-quality enlightened glass, and the viewing angle is 170 degrees diagonally. <br><br>  The recording quality of AdvoCam-FD8 Gold GPS is at an expectedly high level.  Even in conditions of insufficient illumination, the picture looks bright, without dark areas.  The distance of readability of numbers during the day is 20 meters, at night - up to 15 meters.  These are practically the maximum values ‚Äã‚Äãon the modern recorder market.  Only Korean models with a price tag of 14-15 thousand rubles give more.  But for such a price tag "Koreans" practically do not offer any additional features.  In contrast to the "Golden Advocam" for 12.5 thousand rubles. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xNUf1KbPOws" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1fa/a8c/428/1faa8c42806340788fd5e13b68e1d0ea.jpeg"><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/grHkauF77Ks" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e3f/87e/97f/e3f87e97f91542b4a2fb979e6b8d55e8.jpeg"><br><br>  In AdvoCam-FD8 Gold GPS, as well as in the previous model, the LDWS function - the system of control over a lane is realized. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/daa/459/349/daa45934906f4daeb959fd51ce88bdff.jpeg"><br><br>  There is also a GPS-receiver, with the help of which you can impose a speed stamp on the video, record a motion track, etc.  The registrar's memory contains a base not only with speed cameras (as in the case of the AdvoCam-FD8 Red II (GPS + GLONASS), but also with traffic police posts, bad roads, speed bumps and so on. About all these sites the recorder warns the driver. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/24b/48f/968/24b48f968e4c4beb86ec2ad41148fb61.jpeg"><br><br>  The nice thing is that with AdvoCam-FD8 Gold GPS an 8 GB memory card is delivered.  Surprisingly, very few avtoregov comes with memory cards, especially such a volume.  Here it is worth saying that the device has its own built-in memory of 256 MB.  At any time, you can copy a fragment of the video to it with the moment of the accident before giving the card to be attached to the protocol. <br><br>  For more visual information, you can familiarize yourself with the summary table of characteristics of the considered models of the current line of Russian DVRs AdvoCam: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2a0/107/b45/2a0107b458fa4b12b516c0ecd6b10ab8.jpeg"><br><br>  As you can see, <a href="http://advocam.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dtext%26utm_campaign%3Dadvocam">AdvoCam</a> continues to follow its principles.  Do not do cheap "Dashman."  Offer even in the budget segment high-quality devices with high quality shooting.  Independently develop and thoroughly test models for maximum ‚Äúvitality‚Äù in Russian conditions of operation.  In 2016, the brand expanded its range with new models and once again showed what competent and thoughtful registrars from a Russian developer are. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/399673/">https://habr.com/ru/post/399673/</a></p>
