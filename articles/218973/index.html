      Implemented the idea - an employee of the NGO.  S.A.  Lavochkina, head of the spacecraft structure processing center, Ruslan Vladimirovich Komaev.  This is a person who has been involved in the creation of real spacecraft for more than thirty years, and in his spare time he is engaged in reconstructing automatic interplanetary stations, satellites, rover and rover using technological models that have remained in production since the development of the existing devices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/195/8d6/79f/1958d679f2cc619f0d170245bb64f57d.jpg"><br><br>  Earlier, I already <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/203476/">spoke about his ‚ÄúAngara-18‚Äù</a> , where he reconstructs not only Soviet / Russian spacecraft and unmanned aerial vehicles, but also American Apollo.  The goal of his activity is the most noble one - to entice the younger generation with astronautics, to grow a decent space shift, to teach it with examples of successful study and exploration of the Solar System and the whole Universe. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/047/514/ad0/047514ad01aeac16d90f800967c86193.jpg"><br><br>  <a href="https://vk.com/laspace">NGO them.</a>  <a href="https://vk.com/laspace">S.A.</a>  <a href="https://vk.com/laspace">Lavochkina</a> is a large enterprise, but cannot allocate additional funds for educational activities.  At the same time, management understands the importance of such work.  A good museum has been built on the territory of the plant, which accepts excursions (although their organization is fraught with additional difficulties, since the enterprise is regime).  Komaev is also helped by the whole plant, ranging from the management who found the funds for the repair of the Angara-18 to the simple mechanics who come on weekends to turn the nuts in the Apollo nasovskom or Gagarinsky Vostok. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5f9/6cf/ed7/5f96cfed713da30d5f0e7885b3ae2e5a.jpg"><br><br>  Then I proposed to launch ‚ÄúLunokhod-2‚Äù by April 12, in order for everyone to have a chance to try themselves in the role of the driver of the rover.  More precisely, it was an old idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãRuslan Vladimirovich, I just updated it - suggested the date and place - <a href="https://vk.com/vvc_12_04_2014">the Cosmonautics Festival at the All-Russian Exhibition Center</a> .  But there was no place for the explorer of the Moon, but the idea was pleasant to the leadership of the Moscow Planetarium.  Then they managed without me.  And so, on the evening of April 10, ‚ÄúKAMAZ‚Äù, loaded with the history of the Soviet space: ‚ÄúLunokhod-2‚Äù and the descent vehicle of the mission ‚ÄúVeGa‚Äù, entered its gates. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/986/40f/077/98640f0773e22d40a6acb8969a5e7ed0.jpg"><br><br>  It was necessary to unload practically at night, because of the restriction of movement in Moscow of heavy trucks. <br><br>  The first "flew" "Vega".  This time, not to Venus and Halley's comet, but to the entrance to the planetarium. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5bb/69b/f47/5bb69bf473f42a7e0d56860c28ddfc9b.jpg"><br><br>  Ruslan Vladimirovich could not leave his brainchild, so he actively joined in the unloading operations.  And completely refused to pose for a photo. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f60/cb6/cca/f60cb6ccaeae4d1589a43dc565216988.jpg"><br><br>  Unfortunately, I do not know the names of other participants in the installation work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ba3/6ad/5e5/ba36ad5e5a6899e0e4eb7db842dacd8a.jpg"><br><br>  Space stations are installed at the entrance, and for their viewing will not take money.  Therefore, even if it is not possible to sit at the helm of the driver of the lunar rover, then no one should interfere with seeing and taking a photo. <br><br>  The entourage of the planetarium is very well combined with the apparatus. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/75a/c23/9d8/75ac239d87d0370481cfb8a16456f431.jpg"><br><br>  Neither Komaev nor NGO them.  S.A.  Lavochkin for this festive event will not receive money.  He also refuses financial assistance in his reconstruction work.  Therefore, if someone wants to support his work, it is better to <a href="http://www.admhimki.ru/contacts/">write a letter</a> to the Khimki administration with the support of the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbuilding an educational and entertainment popular science Astro-space Center. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/26e/4cd/415/26e4cd415676504d9ceb7a8e3fc30b2e.jpg"><br>  - There is a touch of the surface! <br>  - Congratulations on a successful landing, comrades. <br><br>  Next in line - "Lunokhod-2" <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1db/fdd/2fd/1dbfdd2fd6567968d6ed44fc195b38cf.jpg"><br>  Notice that on the right above the rooftops of the houses in the sky is glistening orange mars.  He has a <a href="http://zelenyikot.livejournal.com/35300.html">standoff</a> now, so he is very bright. <br><br>  With the weather this evening was lucky.  Something sublimely romantic is in the unloading of spacecraft, at the entrance to the planetarium, in the light of the Moon, Jupiter and Mars. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/976/01f/8da/97601f8da4d0daa1294dddcab05f2b93.jpg"><br><br>  "Lunokhod-2" planted in two stages.  At first they simply put it near the lunodrome. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/156/e62/f62/156e62f62081e9f4fc40bd29dace0d46.jpg"><br><br>  A small landfill, covered with sand, was equipped not very conveniently - under the overpass, which significantly complicated the unloading process.  Hooks on cranes - for wimps.  Space engineers will coil anything, anything, if there is such a need. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7c1/2c8/9fb/7c12c89fb98e8eca5993e9e0769e4c61.jpg"><br><br>  The overpass is so low that it does not allow you to open the solar battery, a highly directional antenna can also cause problems. <br><br>  One small step for a man ... <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d24/e90/12c/d24e9012c3f18f6740af28c16cf1707a.jpg"><br><br>  And a giant stepladder for all of humanity! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/18b/d2e/fc7/18bd2efc7edf7a316793bbcddb884455.jpg"><br><br>  This is not an easy job: to inspire children with space. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/522/78e/e5e/52278ee5e550c5e651805dab0ba329d3.jpg"><br><br>  The boom of the crane with great difficulty could squeeze under the overlap.  Lunokhod-2 had to be helped manually, but in the end, the moon landing went well. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/099/94a/263/09994a26341dccd8894d2c2954a750c1.jpg"><br><br>  The next three days Ruslan Vladimirovich Komaev and / or his assistants can be found at the entrance to the Moscow Planetarium.  On Friday afternoon, they will ‚Äúteach to walk‚Äù Lunokhod-2, and at night they will unload the descent capsule of the first-ever spacecraft Vostok at the entrance to the Planetarium. <br><br>  Sit at the wheel "Lunokhod-2" will be on Cosmonautics Day April 12 and April 13.  I will try to tell you how this will go.  I know that the remote control of the moon rover is recreated in the image of the real ones, but there are two control modes: the ‚Äúlunar rover‚Äù itself - from the joystick, and the ‚Äúrover‚Äù - from the command set (For more information about this mode <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/171199/">, the driver of the rover</a> Curiosity <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/171199/">told</a> us). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/218973/">https://habr.com/ru/post/218973/</a></p>
