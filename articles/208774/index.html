In this article, we will consider all sorts of options and their consequences, taking into account comments and observations to previous work. <br><br>  <a href="http://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2009/07/03/is-pnp-an-ill-posed-problem/">Here,</a> quite interestingly from an artistic point of view, the discussion is described around various solutions. <br><br><h5>  P = NP </h5><br>  There are several options for the development of the situation. <br><ul><li>  Constructive solution <br><ol><li>  The polynom has a low degree and moderate coefficients: then the details are <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/207112/">described in the P = NP part of the previous article</a> ;  in short: all cryptography will collapse </li><li>  Polynomial has a high degree - then nothing will change from a practical point of view.

Consider the constructive case (non-constructive in structure is similar to the previous case) <br><ul><li>  The complexity of the solution is always exponential: no changes, the current picture of the world will be fully preserved, no changes in algorithms </li><li>  The complexity of the solution is non-always exponential (see <a href="http://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2009/02/12/a-nightmare-about-sat/">this post</a> ), and for a sufficient number of cases it is polynomial.  In this case, it is almost impossible to predict unambiguously what will happen and you can only speculate: if the factorization task falls into the ‚Äúclass of easy problems‚Äù, then from a practical point of view this will be equivalent to P = NP for an attack on RSA. </li><li>  The complexity of the solution is moderate or low (eg n <sup>log (n)</sup> ), in this case from a practical point of view it will be equivalent to P = NP </li></ul><br><br><h5>  P vs.  NP is not soluble in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%25E2%2580%2593Fraenkel_set_theory">ZFC axiomatics</a> </h5><br>  Detailed and interesting about this is written in the article <a href="http://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/pnp.pdf">Is P Versus NP Formally Independent?</a>  <a href="http://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/pnp.pdf">by Scott Aaronson</a> (the article requires sufficient mathematical culture to understand; approximate reading time is ~ 1/2 pm).  We give a brief overview of the contents of the article. <br><br>  The main message of the article in the following may turn out to be that both the hypotheses P = NP and P! = NP are consistent with the theory of sets.  This can happen if P vs.  NP is independent of the axiomatics of set theory, as for example, the axiom of choice is independent of the other axioms of set theory.  From a practical point of view, this would mean that P! = NP. <br><br><h4>  Formal definition.  Asymmetry of the solvability problem for NP.  CoNP class. </h4><br>  In the theory of complexity, it is customary to formulate problems in the form of ‚Äúsolvability problems‚Äù i.  tasks, the answer to which can only be "yes" or "no."  Classes P and NP are formally defined in terms of languages ‚Äã‚Äãand Turing machines. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6c4/ed7/360/6c4ed7360a882229430c3721b69cab23.png"><br>  where L <sub>M</sub> is the language taken by machine M. <br>  We say that a particular problem p belongs to the class P if there is a deterministic Turing machine that takes the language L (p) for a polynomial number of steps. <br><br>  With the NP class, everything is a little more interesting, this is a class of problems where the correctness of the solution can be checked in polynomial time.  Formally, we say that the language L belongs to NP, if and only if, there exists a deterministic Turing machine M, such that for any string x is true: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a8c/596/a55/a8c596a55a2f6539260cf1731d590938.png"><br>  where | y |  - is bounded by a polynomial and M makes a polynomial number of steps.  For "y" there is a special term - certificate.  In fact, the definition is read as follows - the task belongs to NP, if there exists a polynomial solution, the correctness of which can be checked in polynomial time.  Note that this definition is asymmetric with respect to the question when the language is NOT NP, that is,  The question is not whether the NP language is a separate class. <br><br>  What kind of class is Co-NP?  Co-NP is complement NP, intuitively, this is a class, the tasks in which are the negation of tasks in NP.  If the SAT asks if the assignment is true / false for the variables that the formula is correct, then UNSAT asks if it is true that for ALL assignments the formula is incorrect?  Those.  in other words, is it true that the certificate does not exist. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ae9/4ab/1f8/ae94ab1f80ff160e00da943198e0a350.png"><br>  or in another way it can be formulated as follows: <br>  NP is a collection of languages ‚Äã‚Äãwith short certificates confirming membership. <br>  Co-NP is a collection of languages ‚Äã‚Äãwith concise certificates rejecting membership (= there is no membership certificate) <br><br>  If NP! = Co-NP, then the set of NP-complete and Co-NP-complete tasks do not intersect (a consequence of <a href="http://www.villesalo.com/OtEoDoSNPHL.pdf">Mahaney's theorem</a> ). <br><br>  More information about languages, Turing machines and definitions of complexity classes can be found in M. Gary, D. Johnson: Computers and intractable problems (for example, <a href="http://cs.usu.edu.ru/hardness/data/books/NP-Complectness.pdf">here</a> ) <br><br>  According to modern concepts, the relationship between NP, Co-NP and P is as follows: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c6d/423/45a/c6d42345ae61526e6f8c12bd87d1099d.gif"><br>  (picture taken <a href="http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~csli/graduate/algorithms/book6/chap36.htm">from here</a> ) <br>  Most are inclined to option (d), but some believe that other options are likely to be possible, eg The Whip in <a href="">The Art of Programming 4, 6A draft: Satisfibility</a> - page 1, footnote (*): "... the author of this book, however, suspects that polynomial algorithms [for SAT - author's note] really exist, only they are not yet known to us ... ". <br><br><h4>  2 + p-SAT polynomial? </h4><br>  In a previous article, it was shown that 2-SAT is polynomial, i.e.  if we limit each clause to two variables, the problem can be solved effectively.  Consider a natural generalization of this problem, what if we have only part of the sentences contains 3 variables? <br><br>  Let p be the number of sentences with 3 variables to the total number of sentences.  Then the 2 + p SAT task is a 3-SAT problem, in which the number of sentences with 3 variables, i.e.  p, respectively (1 - p) sentences have 1 or 2 variables. <br><br>  From a theoretical point of view, even if p is the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/77553/">concentration of a barbarian duck in an ocillococcinum,</a> i.e.  any positive number, the NP problem is complete, but in practice it looks completely different. <br>  Let the X axis be the total number of variables in a formula, the Y axis the ‚Äúcomputational cost‚Äù of a solution for a given formula (usually the number of calls / solutions of the state-of-the-art SAT-solver algorithm, see the brief description of DPLL and CDCL in previous article). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1eb/e5d/217/1ebe5d217426fe88de7877812a93b41e.png"><br>  (Schedule taken from work <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/selman/papers/pdf/99.random.typical.pdf">2 + P-SAT: Relation of typical phase transition</a> ). <br><br>  If p &lt;= 0.4, then the problem is polynomial, even more so, linear in the input data.  If p&gt; 0.4, then we observe behavior similar to the classic 3-SAT.  To explain this effect, consider the classic DPLL algorithm (taken from Armin Biere slides): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b81/9cd/ac5/b819cdac5953f819932c19764d451766.png"><br><br>  Consider a simple example. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d22/779/849/d22779849604281eb583c4a66ebc1ff4.png"><br>  Let the algorithm, chose x <sub>2</sub> = 1 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a04/aa3/60d/a04aa360d3c5e934c8342d208d504d0b.png"><br>  Then the formula is simplified and we have two sentences with a single variable - it means that boolean constraint propagation selects one of them, for example, x <sub>3</sub> and assigns the only value available to it <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1ee/c36/0ee/1eec360ee8671ceb094863d35376346c.png"><br>  after assignment x <sub>3</sub> = 1, BCP again finds a sentence with a single variable x <sub>1</sub> , and assigns x <sub>1</sub> = 1 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/853/6a2/dff/8536a2dffddd5b9db8de1f35276403fb.png"><br>  Thus, after a single SAT solver solution, boolean constraint propagation allows finding a solution to the entire formula.  This happens primarily because the decision on a variable in a two-variable sentence actually uniquely determines the value of another variable, which causes a whole cascade of assignments and the BCP effectively reduces the formula.  If such a cascade covers a sufficient number of variables in a formula, then the solution is linear. <br><br><h4>  The dependence of the complexity of the number of variables </h4><br>  Another interesting relationship is the so-called clause-variable-ratio: the ratio of the number of sentences to the number of variables.  Intuitively, the more sentences, the more restrictions, the more likely that formulas are impracticable - too many restrictions.  They say that such a problem is overconstrained.  If there are few sentences and many variables, it means that there are many degrees of freedom and few restrictions.  This makes it easy to find a solution, and it is likely that the formula is workable.  They say about her that she is underconstrained. <br><br>  Since we have already considered 2 + p SAT, it would also be interesting to take into account the parameter p in this relationship, as the degree of "linearity" of the problem, the greater the p, the less effective boolean constraint propagation and the more difficult it is to find a solution. <br><br>  <b>SAT / UNSAT transition for 2 + p SAT</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/155/fa4/e27/155fa4e27640c8fd4388ea03eab81883.png"><br>  Graph from Nature article: <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/selman/papers/pdf/99.nature.phase.pdf%25E2%2580%258E">Determining computational complexity from characteristic `phase transitions'</a> by Remi Monasson, Riccardo Zecchina, Scott Kirkpatrick, Bart Selman and Lidror Troyanskyk <br><br>  In fact, this graph gives us more than we think: it allows us to generate "complex" random formulas.  If the formula is somewhere in the center between SAT and UNSAT, this means that it is difficult for her to find a model and it is difficult to generate proof of impracticability. <br>  The dependence of the number of DPLL calls on the position of the SAT / UNSAT transition is as follows <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/878/9ec/460/8789ec460500f47b46b5db8aff3cca18.png"><br>  Graph from the article <a href="">Finding Hard Instances of the Satisability ability Problem: A Survey</a> by S. Cook, D. Mitchell <br><br><h4>  About modern SAT solvers </h4><br>  Even a description of the basic principles, algorithms and heuristics will take more than one hundred pages, so we confine ourselves to one of the descriptions of one of the most popular and key SAT algorithms: CDCL - Conflict Driven Clause Learning.  As the name suggests, one of the main features of this algorithm is the ability to memorize solutions that do not lead to a solution, namely, the algorithm remembers them in the form of sentences.  If we make decisions x <sub>1</sub> = 1, x <sub>2</sub> = 2, x <sub>3</sub> = 1 and this leads to a conflict, then CDCL will remember the negation of the conflicting combination. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/eee/03f/bc9/eee03fbc993d1a56c02e3d77b268e73c.png"><br>  according to De Morgan's rule, we bring to CNF <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7d9/b3d/bf5/7d9b3dbf5949496b98f5bce1d24066b2.png"><br>  and add it to the formula <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d94/1be/3af/d941be3af47ac7c92fdd5b29b693e357.png"><br><br>  Thus, there are two key components of CDCL: an implication graph with a stack of decisions taken and work with conflicting combinations.  As a rule, after making a decision, the algorithm performs all possible deterministic calculations and comes to a conflict.  The graph of implications and the solution stack show what combination and decision at which stage led to a conflict, based on this, generating a conflict proposal - hence the name Conflict Driven Clause Learning, the algorithm effectively finds conflict combinations, learns them and makes decisions, considering conflict combinations . <br><br>  Consider the example of the work of the CDCL algorithm in more detail: <br><div class="slideshow"><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/14412470&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjaPX8n5AjLSM2wS0vfb0JLbgZU9g" width="425" height="355" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><br>  from <strong><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/sakai">Masahiro Sakai</a></strong> <br><br>  More about CDCL is written in the following papers: <br>  Handbook of Satisfaction ability: <a href="https://www.enseignement.polytechnique.fr/informatique/INF321/TD-12_13/TD910/files/SATHandbook-CDCL.pdf">Chapter 4.
