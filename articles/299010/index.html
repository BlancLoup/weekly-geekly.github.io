According to the operator, this is the first investment of the fund.  "COMMIT Capital" bought out 30% of the company for 100 million rubles. <br><br>  100% Raidix belongs to its founder Andrei Fedorov.  Then the company's valuation will be about 333 million rubles.  In 2015, Raidix revenue amounted to 100 million rubles.  Of these, a little more than half are on the international market, said Raidix CEO Alexander Katashov.  Raidix products are purchased by companies from all over the world. <br><br>  According to Alexey Kupriyanov, the director of the CommIT Capital fund, Rostelecom's money will be spent on expanding Raidix sales.  According to Kupriyanov, Raidix now occupies less than 1% of both the Russian and global market for storage software.

      The main competitors of Raidix are global corporations - <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/20156/">Dell-EMC</a> , <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM">IBM</a> , <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitachi">Hitachi</a> and others. <a name="habracut"></a>  The entire Russian market of data storage systems Kupriyanov estimates at 40 billion rubles, of which the software (the segment in which Raidix operates) accounts for about 5-7 billion rubles. <br><br>  According to Alexei Basov, Vice-President of Rostelecom, Raidix solutions can be used in backup-related products, content libraries, virtualization, and big data.  Therefore, the share of Raidix in the Russian market can be increased both by purchasing Rostelecom itself and by its customers.  To meet their needs, the company will be able to refine the product using the expertise of Rostelecom. <br><br>  On January 14, Megamind <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/23278/">wrote</a> that Raidix submitted an application to the Russian Software Registry.  The application is still in the status of consideration. <br><br>  Alexey Kupriyanov expects that in five years the company's share in the Russian market will reach 20‚Äì30%, and its annual yield in rubles will be 30‚Äì40%.  After that, the Commite Capital fund plans to withdraw from Raidix capital. <br><br>  However, the fund is ready to dilute its share if it receives a successful offer from other investors. <br><br>  Such a company can cost from three to four annual revenues, believes Sergey Azatyan, a partner of the venture fund <a href="http://inventurepartners.ru/">InVenture Partners</a> .  In an interview with ‚ÄúVedomosti‚Äù, he said that, in his opinion, Raidix has a demanded product and a diversified client base.  Since Rostelecom specializes in data storage, it can act as an independent customer, as well as bring in new customers, which can significantly increase the value of the company, says Azatyan. <br><blockquote>  The reason for the growing popularity of storage systems is the constant decline in the cost of standard components, as well as the ability to create much more intelligent devices based on server processors as compared to conventional hardware (ASICs) storage systems. </blockquote><br>  Rostelecom decided to create a venture capital fund in 2014.  But this idea was realized only in 2015.  Rostelecom has placed 1.5 billion rubles in its accounts.  As the money is spent, the fund‚Äôs capital can be increased, he adds.  According to Basov, now in addition to Raidix, there are three more active deals, which are expected to close in the first half of 2016.  During the existence of the fund, its experts have reviewed more than 300 companies. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299010/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299010/</a></p>
