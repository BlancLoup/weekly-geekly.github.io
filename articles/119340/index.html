  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The experience of implementing a corporate social network and internal document management organization</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This topic is devoted to describing the process of developing and implementing a budget version of a corporate social network (corporate portal) and internal document management of an organization of 600+ employees. <br><br>  <i>The main goal is to show that it is possible to deploy a corporate social network on your own and establish internal document management without resorting to expensive commercial solutions from Microsoft, 1C Bitrix, Google solutions, etc.</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  After reading the article on Habr√©, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/pm/118596/">improving the productivity of knowledge workers</a> , which in my opinion quite well describes a number of typical obstacles in the information development of organizations and barriers that hinder the increase in the performance of personnel earning bread through mental work, I decided to give an example of a practical solution to a number of problems identified in it. <br><br>  The story began in 2007, when I got a job at a large regional credit organization for a programmer position (very few people in the regions know about web developers, so everyone who writes at least something on something is called a programmer).

      Literally from the very first days of work, a number of obstacles were found that significantly complicate the implementation of routine service operations such as all sorts of approvals, signing documents, statements, etc., caused by a very extensive hierarchy of management and extremely opaque areas of responsibility of numerous divisions.  In the course of solving such bureaucratic puzzles, you must first find the answer to a number of obvious questions: <br><ul><li>  What unit deals with this issue? </li><li>  Find out who exactly in this unit is engaged in this? (In the presence of temporarily replacing the task is complicated) </li><li>  Where is the workplace of the right employee? </li><li>  How does he / she actually look like? </li></ul><br>  Thus, passing this quest daily on almost every issue that requires participation / coordination with employees of departments other than their own, the obvious question arises: <b>How much working time is wasted?</b> <br><br>  Having in the past experience in developing under <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wamp">LAMP and WAMP</a> , I turned to my direct leadership with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating an internal corporate resource on the organization's intranet, which could easily find the full name / photo / phone / office of the right employee and his remit.  However, taking into account the fact that the management team had already worked for more than 3-5-7 years in the organization and during that time they had already learned how to solve what typical issues, I was refused because it was <i>unreasonable to waste working time on such nonsense, it‚Äôs so easy to remember that Lena on the 3rd floor is engaged in those, and Kolya on the 6th - this, everything is simple and obvious</i> .  However, in practice, it turns out that Lena went on maternity leave, and Kohl went on vacation, but the question does not tolerate delay. <br><br>  It must be admitted that such an argument turned out to be unconvincing for me because by that time I was already familiar at the user level at the previous place of work in telecom how simple and effective such systems are and how much time they save in their daily work.  Therefore, I decided not to abandon this issue, but to introduce it gradually by hanging the functionality on my interface for accepting payments through the browser, which I developed and accompanied as part of the main job function.  After all, to control access to such an interface, in any case, you need a database of cashiers, workplaces, etc.  paraphernalia.  Also for personal convenience, I began to use web access to my own documentation for the payment interface because it was easier and more convenient than sending doc files to each employee personally.  Moreover, this way of distributing documentation received many positive reviews from the employees who read it, unlike the traditional paper method of passing through all instances of management.  So the list of problems in production that had to be solved was replenished: <br><ul><li>  Orders and other regulatory documents are either brought to the performers with a long delay, or are lost in someone's reception or on the table of any of the managers. </li><li>  Lack of control of familiarization with the above orders and instructions. </li><li>  An extremely inconvenient method of personalized distribution of numerous instructions to employees, resulting in significant loss of time and, as a result, disregard for the preparation and updating of documentation as such. </li><li>  Lack of information about corporate changes, promotions, new and dismissed employees, etc. </li><li>  The lack of operational control of the passage of memos and at what stage they are at a given time. </li></ul><br>  Of course, there were already many ready-made solutions for solving these problems, indicated at the beginning of the topic, but either they solved the above tasks only partially, or their cost caused extreme discontent among the management.  In this regard, he was forced to use his own workstation as the server part for the first six months.  Yes, you heard it right.  Such is the concern and understanding of data protection problems in many, many organizations.  Fortunately, I immediately developed and implemented a backup system for critical data on a file server in a local network. <br><br>  Then the 2nd stage of implementation began from the bottom.  I gave the employees the opportunity to register themselves on my resource and fill in about typical corporate coordinates and photos about themselves, i.e.  voluntarily, not by orders from above.  It must be admitted that the pace of registration turned out to be serious and surpassed my wildest expectations.  Despite the general silence about the problems indicated by me, the search function for an employee and his coordinates in the office by full name turned out to be the most popular.  In the future, I persuaded to lay out and orders on the organization in the general access to the web resource on the intranet for more rapid notification and downloading logged in the database of who / when / where.  After that, the resource voluntarily registered another third of the total number of personnel in the organization.  ‚ÄúOverboard‚Äù turned out to be only employees who are not supposed to have a computer at work (drivers, cleaners, guards) and a group of employees who basically do something only by order with notification and painting under it. <br><br>  And only now, a year later, it was possible to achieve approval from above, the official approval of the provision on the corporate portal and a positive decision on the issue of purchasing a dedicated server in the rack.  I didn‚Äôt have to spend money on software, because everything with relatively no problems (except for completely solved problems with encoding) was transferred from <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wamp">WAMP</a> to <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wamp">LAMP</a> server. <br><br>  Further, after the official approval, the development went at a faster pace.  For example, the list of employees began to be updated regularly from personnel software, the module of working with memos and their vising was constantly improved.  As part of the upcoming attestation, I developed a module for electronic testing of employees' knowledge.  Added diary module, "my reports" and polls.  After reading on the Internet that <a href="http://www.hrm.ru/db/hrm/579ACCCC391E80FFC32576F6004E7BB6/category.html">Sberbank introduced employee bonuses for rationalization proposals, it</a> added the ‚ÄúDevelopment Proposals‚Äù module so that problems on the ground are not ignored and where everyone could designate their proposal or openly support / not support someone else's. <br><br>  That's all for now.  I hope someone will be useful example of how to implement such a project in the complete absence of support from the leadership, which by the way and to this day considers this task not a priority because it <i>does not bring a clear income in monetary terms</i> , but judging by the many thanks from ordinary employees, The positive effect is obvious.  Attempts to indicate the saved cost of labor of numerous employees also did not lead to anything.  Be prepared for this if you decide to repeat my implementation experience for ‚Äúthank you‚Äù. <br><br>  Thanks to everyone who mastered this topic entirely, I will be glad to answer your questions and, if necessary, will decipher the points of interest to you in more detail. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/119340/">https://habr.com/ru/post/119340/</a></p>
