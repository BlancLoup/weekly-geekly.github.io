Kingston Industrial Temperature microSD UHS-I Memory Card Review</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>Hi, Giktayms!</b>  As you know, ordinary memory cards are designed to work in rather mild conditions.  They will not tolerate extremely low or high temperatures, there is no protection from X-rays, and if dropped from a large height, the flash drive is likely to become unusable.  Well, then the use of memory cards is not limited to the household sphere, data carriers are needed in industrial steel shops, on intercontinental container ships.  In addition, you need to build video surveillance systems in places where a person is very dangerous: at power plants, in high-temperature furnaces and in the warehouses of mining companies in Eastern Siberia.  For such tasks just need a series of durable, reliable and durable cards <a href="http://www.kingston.com/ru/flash/microsd_cards/sdcit">Kingston Industrial</a> . <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/kingston_technology/blog/276076/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/346/959/1bf/3469591bfb064ba190a2c1964a8d0021.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Industrial Temperature microSD UHS-I cards</b> are capable of operating in a temperature range from ‚Äì45 to +85 degrees Celsius.  That is, in fact, everywhere: in Antarctica, in the Sahara.  Since they are called industrial, they are mainly used for serious purposes: in modern military equipment, energy fields, laboratories, at construction sites, in the space industry.  Here the security of the card and its ability to work in harsh conditions come to the fore. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e2d/4cd/f8b/e2d4cdf8b5324025869645a22b425774.jpg">

      If the equipment stays at low air temperature for a long time, the card will not suffer either.  So Kingston Industrial Temperature flash drives are suitable for working in the field, when the equipment is in the cold for weeks. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/uQhXbuBQke4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhAhUjYUIHq5CZT74cd05jCnehI_A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  At a construction site, it is quite possible to use a quadrocopter to fly around the area - for example, when building a skyscraper.  Such a video is easy to shoot, and it will not be superfluous at the presentation to investors or construction customers.  Helicopter rental will definitely be much more expensive than a quadrocopter with a GoPro suspended on it.  However, the aircraft sometimes fall, and it is important to save the footage.  Ordinary memory cards do not have protection against falls and vibrations, while the Industrial Temperature flash drives ensure the good performance of the microSD after serious shocks. <br><br>  But what if to abstract from industrial tasks and to imagine how USB flash drives can serve the benefit of science?  After all, video is often used to record the progress of the experiment.  You can take something simple - slow-motion frosts of plants with liquid nitrogen, and you can play the world-famous experiment "Schr√∂dinger's cat." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/df1/084/2b7/df10842b7f5543a3be3b359eda16b434.jpg"><br><br>  We believe that the essence of the experiment, which has never been really carried out, you all know very well.  A cat is locked in a steel chamber with a device that is completely protected from the cat's influence.  Inside the Geiger counter there is a scanty amount of radioactive substance, so scanty that only one atom can decay within an hour, but with the same probability it can not disintegrate.  If this happens, the reading tube is discharged and a relay is triggered, lowering the hammer that breaks the cone with hydrocyanic acid.  It is completely impossible to determine from the outside whether the cat is alive or dead.  But it is possible to install an autonomous video surveillance system in the steel chamber, which will ultimately help determine whether the cat is still alive.  And if not, was it a consequence of the experiment, or did he simply not endure the boredom and kill himself on his own? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f9f/b31/abb/f9fb31abbbb94ae789c6e112ce450a04.jpg"><br><br>  But Kingston was not limited to protection from falls and high / low temperatures.  Cards are tested by sharp temperature changes and changes in humidity to make sure that the flash drive works in any conditions.  The test lasts several hundred hours, for which the card is heated, cooled, heated, dried, unscrewed to the minimum and to the maximum, the humidity parameters, passed through x-rays and then all this is repeated in different sequences more than once.  The result was a map-terminator, able to survive almost any external influence (except, of course, sledgehammers).  The manufacturer has provided for the frequent removal of the memory card - sometimes in this way the flash drive can be accidentally broken, or the plastic will be damaged by frequent extraction.  The cards are designed for at least ten thousand install-extract cycles.  This will be enough for many years - the card will become morally obsolete faster than it will fail.  The official guarantee, by the way, is five years. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c59/2c6/b8b/c592c6b8bcb344e4a240613a281c9261.jpg"><br><br>  The card has a number of certificates confirming its resistance to external influences.  So, Kingston Industrial Temperature microSD is assigned the category <b>IPX7</b> - this means that the flash drive can withstand half an hour under water at a depth of one meter.  But this is minor compared to the military testing methodology according to the standard MIL-STD-883H.  The method under the designation 2002.5 suggests a short-term impact on a force map from 500G (1 m / s in duration) to 30,000G (within 0.12 m / s).  The brittle-looking flash drive passed, without exaggeration, a serious test.  Radiation protection complies with ISO 7816-1 certificate.  The card can withstand 0.1 Gy of X-ray radiation from the front and from the back.  This dose corresponds to 10 radas or 100 mSv.  For example, with film fluorography, you get a dose of about 0.5 mSv, and from x-rays and even less - 0.3 mSv.  It is believed that 0.1 Gy - permissible short-term exposure in emergency situations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/125/5be/677/1255be677ee14217a3713683bd1944d9.png"><br><br>  Industrial Temperature cards are available in versions from 8 to 64 gigabytes.  Depending on the volume characteristics differ.  All flash drives have a read speed of 90 MB / s, but for the 8 GB version, the write speed is 20 MB / s, and for 16, 32 and 64 GB models, it is 45 MB / s.  Speed ‚Äã‚ÄãClass - UHS-I Speed ‚Äã‚ÄãClass U1.  Such speed indicators remove any limitations in shooting: slow-motion video in Full HD at a frequency of 120 frames per second, shooting at 4K resolution, a quick series of photos - the card easily copes with any tasks. <br><br>  Testing in the Crystal Disk Mark using the Kingston FCR-HS4 USB3.0 card reader showed a slightly lower speed.  The 16 GB card showed almost 84 megabytes per second in read mode and nearly 47 MB ‚Äã‚Äã/ s in write mode. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/493/a62/08c/493a6208caa440cdb126e290d34021dd.jpg"><br><br>  Kingston has made the most durable memory card, and there are many areas where recording capabilities can be really useful at extremely low or high temperatures.  Resistance to falls is also not for show.  Shooting on <b>GoPro</b> and similar cameras for extreme people are gaining popularity, drones are increasingly involved in amateur and professional videos.  Broken devices are not as important as the information recorded on the card itself.  Kingston Industrial Temperature flash drives will save data from any incidents. <br><br>  By the way, you know that you can subscribe <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/kingston_technology/topics/">to our blog</a> - so you definitely will not miss the new materials.
