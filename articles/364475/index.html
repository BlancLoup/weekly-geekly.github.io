Wearable electronics are far from telephones, but the market is developing: in the period from July to September, the demand for such equipment grew by 40% compared with the third quarter of last year. <br><br>  A few years ago, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsmart gadgets that track the physical condition and movement of its owner, transmitting information about it to the world wide web and interacting with other electronics, found its expression only in the minds of science fiction and multipliers. <br><br>  Today, the "fairy tale" has become a reality.  The wearable electronics market <a href="http://www.dailycomm.ru/m/27355/">leaders are</a> fitness trackers.  And leaders <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/canalys-wearable-band-shipments-up-684-percent-fitbit-and-jawbone-lead-7000032848/">among manufacturers</a> are Fitbit, Jawbone, Garmin, Polar and others.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aee/a1d/133/aeea1d1333c34399809436f5ce605d8e.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Last year, two market leaders, Fitbit and Jawbone, presented their updated models.  These were Fitbit Force and Jawbone UP24.  Model Force immediately became a favorite among competitors due to the convenience of design and pedometer, which is considered one of the most accurate on the market.  However, some users began to receive complaints of allergies caused by Fitbit Force nickel inserts.  Therefore, the model was promptly withdrawn from sale in the spring of 2014 and six months later, in November, after ‚Äúworking on the bugs‚Äù, they released an updated line of bracelets, which consists of Charge models, Charge HR (version with heart rate monitor) and Surge (smart watches with fitness tracker, the model is equipped with a gps tracker). <br><br>  We decided to dwell on the Fitbit Charge as on the most popular model of the Fitbit line for December 2014. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/32b/328/aee/32b328aee42447d8b7ca5cb17023eed1.png"><br><br><h4>  Design and construction </h4><br>  Fitbit Charge differs from its competitors restrained design and classic colors, so it can fit almost any style of clothing.  Fitness tracker is available in four colors - Black, Slate, Blue, Burgundi. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/063/41f/a0a/06341fa0ab8f41759fcbd1b82d429ff2.jpg"><br><br>  FitBit Charge, like the previous version of Fitbit Force, is very ergonomic: the strap is made of soft material, fits well, takes the shape of a hand.  The clasp of a model with unaccustomed may even seem tight, but during active training it will be only a plus.  Not all fitness trackers have a clasp.  In some modern trackers, for example, in Jawbone UP24, it is missing: the bracelet seems to clasp the arm, but the ends of it remain free, so they can catch on the clothes, causing inconvenience to their owner. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d3e/564/a5e/d3e564a5e2aa44b3acfb551026053ad0.jpg" width="600"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8a1/646/061/8a164606186f4ca69de777d80ce29605.jpg" width="600"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/034/e8a/1a1/034e8a1a13d7483a82d691b4bf515be7.jpg" width="600"><br><br><h4>  Opportunities </h4><br>  A small monochrome OLED screen is placed on the front of the Charge; you can turn it on by pressing a button in the left side.  The screen displays the time and date, as well as achievements - the number of steps, calories burned, floors traveled by stairs.  Using a smartphone, you can customize what achievements will be shown and in what sequence.  Another important purpose of the screen is that when synchronizing with a smartphone, it will show who is calling you.  Alerts to achievements and calls occur through vibration. <br><br>  For those who want to track the heart rate, Fitbit Charge HR will be more suitable, since this function is not provided in the Charge model. <br><br><h4>  Applications </h4><br>  To get started with FitBit Charge, you need to install the Fitbit application on your smartphone and specify individual parameters (age, weight, etc.) For FitBit, there are applications for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.fitbit.FitbitMobile%26hl%3Dru">Android</a> , <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/fitbit/id462638897%3Fmt%3D8">iOS</a> or <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/ru-ru/store/app/fitbit/378ebdb6-f31f-4505-a00d-c460ef22e7ff">Windows Phone</a> .  Users who do not have basic knowledge of the English language may face some difficulties: the interface of the Fitbit application is not translated into Russian.  The developers have tried to make the interface as simple and accessible as possible at the conceptual level, so you quickly get used to the application.  Many other brands, by contrast, have applications with a Russified interface.  For example, UP24 works with Jawbone's UP app for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.jawbone.up%26hl%3Dru">Android</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/up-tracker-required-up-up24/id461125277%3Fmt%3D8">iOS</a> .  Unlike other company's fitness trackers, a sufficient number of third-party applications have not yet been developed for Fitbit.  However, of course, this is a temporary situation. <br><br>  Next, we compare the "native" application for Fitbit and applications for Jawbone on Android 4.4.2. <br><br>  <i>Summary table</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1d2/f17/dbd/1d2f17dbd3064f239421837cd7def67b.jpeg" width="300"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/804/d36/a99/804d36a99d7d47f893c1a9e4f57e5c1d.jpeg" width="300"><br><br>  <i>Menu</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/45a/90f/876/45a90f876338463c96917814c9984aab.jpeg" width="300"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2a0/9dd/612/2a09dd612b564a61b155cae35ad0bd18.jpeg" width="300"><br><br>  <i>Trainings</i> <br><br>  We conducted comparative testing of Fitbit Charge and Jawbone UP24 both in the gym and in everyday life.  Fitness tracker applications calculate the approximate amount of calories burned, depending on the type of activity entered.  According to the test results, it can be said that Fitbit Charge has slightly more steps than Jawbone UP24.  That is, Jawbone UP24 proved to be more accurate. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/103/748/262/10374826227f403098206a1c8ba37dda.jpeg" width="300"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/87d/abe/20e/87dabe20e12f4dbb916eebd9c671c908.jpeg" width="300"><br><br>  Some application functions may even seem redundant.  For example, not every user will write down the diet and evaluate the benefits of eating. <br><br>  <i>Sleep tracking</i> <br><br>  For active people who have a busy schedule and value their time, the quality and duration of sleep has always been in the foreground.  FitBit recognizes the state of sleep automatically, which is a big plus for developing the most effective sleep and wakefulness mode.  At Fitbit Charge, vibration is used for a ‚Äúgentle‚Äù awakening of the wearer.  However, he does not have a special function for recognizing the phases of sleep, such as the Jawbone UP24, which allows you to wake a person after the end of the REM sleep phase, so that he feels most awake and sleepy. <br><br>  The image on the right shows two sleep periods per day in the FitBit application, on the left - a restful sleep with the eyes of UP24. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ecf/8a7/b30/ecf8a7b3048d40068c0f93f52f9a4e79.jpeg" width="300"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ca4/08d/16c/ca408d16cfa24edda009a7c6e366ce23.jpeg" width="300"><br><br>  <i>Third-party applications in the UP menu</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eb0/5b4/a41/eb05b4a4192d4df78872bbfd3ad84fad.jpeg" width="300"><br><br><h4>  Battery and recharge </h4><br>  A full charge of FitBit Charge is enough for 7-10 days.  In general, this is a good result, as some fitness trackers work less.  Charging is carried out using the USB cable that comes in the kit, from a power outlet or a computer.  There is no information about the battery on the device screen, it can be seen in the smartphone. <br><br>  Of course, there are more ‚Äúlong-playing‚Äù fitness trackers.  For example, Jawbone UP24 with the latest firmware version will live up to 14 days without recharging.  Such a long period of work, including, is achieved due to the lack of a display. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c7a/4bd/7d4/c7a4bd7d4a3c41e085b2231d75fbe6d8.jpg" width="600"><br><br><h4>  Let's make a brief comparison of the Fitbit Charge functionality with the most popular Jawbone UP24 2014 fitness tracker. </h4><br><table><tbody><tr><th></th><th>  Fitbit Charge </th><th>  Jawbone UP24 </th></tr><tr><th>  Screen </th><th>  <font color="#035dd8">Monochrome</font> </th><td>  Missing </td></tr><tr><th>  Third Party Applications </th><td>  Works with some third-party applications. </td><th>  <font color="#035dd8">Works with many applications</font> <font color="#035dd8"><br></font>  <font color="#035dd8">including <a href="http://www.myfitnesspal.com/ru/mobile/android">MyFitnessPal</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.fitnesskeeper.runkeeper.pro">Runkeeper</a> ,</font> <font color="#035dd8"><br></font>  <font color="#035dd8">and with third-party devices like</font> <font color="#035dd8"><br></font>  <font color="#035dd8"><a href="https://nest.com/thermostat/life-with-nest-thermostat/">Nest Learning Thermostat</a></font> </th></tr><tr><th>  Pedometer </th><th>  <font color="#035dd8">Counts the distance traveled</font> <font color="#035dd8"><br></font>  <font color="#035dd8">number of floors and steps</font> </th><td>  Counts the number of steps </td></tr><tr><th>  Alerts </th><th>  <font color="#035dd8">Calls, achieving goals</font> </th><td>  Reminds you to warm up <br>  and about bedtime </td></tr><tr><th>  Sleep tracker and alarm clock </th><td>  Tracks sleep phases <br>  It wakes strictly at the scheduled time. </td><th>  <font color="#035dd8">Tracks sleep phases</font> <font color="#035dd8"><br></font>  <font color="#035dd8">wakes up within 30 minutes</font> <font color="#035dd8"><br></font>  <font color="#035dd8">before scheduled time</font> <font color="#035dd8"><br></font>  <font color="#035dd8">in the shallow sleep phase</font> </th></tr><tr><th>  Water resistant </th><td>  Missing.

The model has tangible benefits: the bracelet has become the benchmark for accuracy among fitness trackers, it fits tightly thanks to a buckle, has a display on which you can see achievements at any time, without reaching for a smartphone, and also see a call alert.  Fitbit Charge looks stylish and fits any clothes.  It is equipped with an alarm clock and provides information on the quality and quantity of sleep of its owner.  The only significant disadvantage of Fitbit Charge is its high price.  Based on monthly sales statistics, FitBit Charge fitness trackers are not very popular.  This is due to the growth of the dollar and the fact that the product comes to Russia already at new prices.  It is worth noting that the Jawbone UP3, the output of which is expected in the coming months, will be more similar to the FitBit Force than its predecessor. <br><br>  Like all fitness trackers, Fitbit Charge and Jawbone UP24 play a certain social role: thanks to interesting applications that allow you to compare and discuss your daily achievements with friends, they can really affect the discipline of their owner, of course, if you want to change for the better. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.up-house.ru/gadgets/bracelet/fitbit">Fitbit Charge</a> and <a href="http://www.up-house.ru/gadgets/bracelet/jawbone_up24">Jawbone UP24</a> are available on our website. <br><br> <a href="http://www.up-house.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/621/cde/7cd/621cde7cdbe740cc967babe110d01423.jpg" alt="image"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/364475/">https://habr.com/ru/post/364475/</a></p>
