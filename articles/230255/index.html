Moreover, the article was not written for IT shnik.  But in the end they decided to post the article, because the techniques there are set out, as it seemed to us, quite universal, and in the end they are not invited to behave at the interview like this:

Practical recommendations. ‚Äù </h4><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So you decided to change jobs.  And you really want to change your place of work and your salary.  But how to properly negotiate with the employer on this issue?  Some recommendations are below. <br><br>  The first thing you have to cope with is your internal installation, saying that asking for money is bad, embarrassing and indecent.  To ask - yes, to negotiate - no.  You must be confident in yourself and in your positions.  Your employer expects the candidates to make a logical, balanced justification for their wishes.  But in any negotiations there are a lot of tricks about which you need to remember. <br><br><h5>  Practical advice </h5><br>  1. Until you receive an official job offer - do not talk about salary, especially if you are not asked about it.  For the employer, the question about the money from the candidate at the start of the relationship is a demonstration that the person will not be loyal to the company and if someone else offers $ 100.  more, he will immediately leave this organization. <br><br>  2. If you are asked to fill out a questionnaire in which there is a column ‚ÄúSpecify the desired salary amount‚Äù, feel free to write: ‚Äúunder discussion‚Äù.  If you do not require an exact number, write the interval (add 10% to the latter, add 20% to achieve an acceptable result and there was an opportunity for bargaining).  The personnel officers have a simple scheme to understand how much you are worth.  Usually they ask: ‚ÄúWhat is the minimum amount below which you will not work?‚Äù Suppose you call a figure of 1000 cu, a personnel officer, something scribbles in the questionnaire and asks the question again: ‚ÄúAnd if the salary is 950 cu.  - will you agree? ‚ÄùYou start to think frantically, and this figure will suit you or not, if you have set 20% for trading, you will easily‚Äú give up ‚Äù- these are 50 USD  and agree.  But the personnel officer does not let up: "And if it will be 900 cu?" So, they determine your lower limit of the wage trade step by step. <br><br>  If possible, move away from salary questions until you get a job offer from your future manager.  It is in his interest that you be motivated and ready to work in this position as long as possible.  No one is satisfied with the staff turnover; it is at least not economically profitable.  (We do not take examples of organizations that build their economies on employees' deception, when they promise you a lot, you believe, but only after a probationary period, be like Pope Carlo, and you are told in three months that you did not pass a probationary period and to find the next trusting citizen.) <br><br><h5>  Literate wording for answers about salary: </h5><br><ul><li>  ‚ÄúI would like to discuss this issue later when you realize that I‚Äôm approaching this position.‚Äù </li><li>  "I believe your company that it takes on the work of only highly professional specialists, providing them a decent salary." </li><li>  "I assume that the salaries in your company have already been approved for all positions, I am ready to accept them, if you voice them, etc." </li></ul><br>  Constantly monitor how much your specialists are on the labor market.  Even if you are satisfied with everything at your workplace, walk through interviews.  At a minimum, you will be aware of what requirements the market places on your position, what is offered in return. <br><br>  When receiving a proposal with an indication of salary, take a pause.  Not for long, for one day.  Remember, professionals are expensive because they do not fuss and know their value. <br><br>  Professionals do not bargain, they just don‚Äôt need it, because they don‚Äôt stand in line for work, but organizations persuade them.  Show that you are a professional.  But do not delay your decision for more than one day, professionals think quickly. <br>  Examine carefully the compensation package offered by the employer. <br><br>  What is important: <br><ul><li>  Salary indexation, its frequency and size </li><li>  Vacation, as provided, time off and sick leave </li><li>  Is there any material encouragement for the training you go through? </li><li>  What kind of training is in the company - only intra-company or the company sends you somewhere </li><li>  With medical insurance, its volume, what it includes, what is considered as an insured event, what is not considered </li></ul><br><h5>  Salary Negotiation Strategy </h5><br>  <b>Get ready!</b>  Believe me, at the meeting itself you will never be able to clearly defend your interests if you have not prepared a certain line of conduct, arguments, methods of withdrawal. <br><br>  <b>Hold on with dignity.</b>  Remember your strengths, professional, personal.  Prepare bright, beautiful examples from your working experience.  Remember, you are taken to the organization so that you can benefit from it, so tell us how much your previous company gained from your activity, how you helped save it from the crisis, how you took it to the leaders, etc.  Do not be afraid to somewhat exaggerate their merits.  Remember, you are in the labor market, it is important to teach yourself correctly.  And explain the reason for your care with your desire to develop, that you have grown out of the position, department, company, you need new horizons. <br><br>  And so you received a specific proposal from your future leader, you took a pause, thought and agreed ... to the second round of negotiations.  Now you need to fix your relationship with the company at the level of a verbal agreement in order to turn it into a written one in the future.  Remember that you continue to be assessed, and by the way you defend your interests, your manager will assume that you will also defend the interests of his unit. <br><br>  So, you have done all the preliminary research work, received a formal job offer, held the necessary pause, weighed all the pros and cons and met again with the employer in the second round of negotiations.  When negotiating a salary, pay attention to the following points. <br><br>  Negotiating is what potential employers expect from you.  You should conduct this part of the negotiations as professionally as you would when discussing your functional skills.  Always remember that this part of the negotiation is of fundamental importance.  For example, if you are going to be engaged in trade and sales and at the same time do not even try to negotiate wages, this may be the last test at your interview.  The employer may be quite logical suspicion: if you can not discuss your salary, how are you going to negotiate multi-million dollar contracts for the company? <br><br>  Even if you do not apply for positions related to trade, employers may be alerted by your incompetence when discussing the issue of wages.  Therefore, do not rush, act thoughtfully and convincingly.  After all, this question also demonstrates your knowledge of the market.  For example, when buying a used car, do not you ask yourself: ‚ÄúWhat is happening?‚Äù, ‚ÄúIs this price normal?‚Äù - if the first offer is accepted immediately, without any discussion?  In a hiring situation, do not allow yourself to be an excellent candidate about which the company has doubts because of its easy compliance. <br><br>  <b>Make sure that negotiations are conducted on an equal footing with the interests of both parties.</b>  It is important to achieve mutual understanding.  When a company offers you a certain amount, it‚Äôs safer than having half of it.  Not the best time to stand your ground, because you have to work with these people if you accept the offer.  It is better to fall to the ground than to adhere to tactics that sound like "I, I, I".  Think about it from the position of belonging to a team and perception of the principles of loyalty to the corporate culture of this company.  Analyze for yourself the following typical cases that arise in wage bargaining, as well as possible reactions to them. <br><br><h6>  You have a great offer. </h6><br>  Possible reaction: ‚ÄúI have carefully read your proposal.  I must admit that it is quite competitive.  However, your proposed monthly salary is 10% lower than what I currently earn.  Although bonuses will help improve the situation, I still would suggest revising the size of the base salary.  Is it possible to change the size of the proposed salary? " <br><br><h6>  You have a good offer </h6><br>  Possible reaction: ‚ÄúDefinitely, my expectations are almost met.  However, I was hoping for a slightly larger amount ranging from ... to ... How big are our opportunities for further salary discussions? ‚Äù <br><br><h6>  You made an offer with a low salary </h6><br>  Possible reaction: ‚ÄúI really like you, and the work seems appropriate.  Successes in management and organizational strategy also seem significant.  The only thing we need to talk about and the only thing holding me back is the initial proposal for the compensation package.  Frankly, the salary is less than I expected.  I am really interested in this position, and, to my knowledge, $ X is an approximate salary level.  In other companies I negotiate with, about as many are offered.  Can you do something in this direction? ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Find out the availability of alternatives.</b>  If your efforts at the salary negotiations did not have any success, and the company did not offer a reasonable salary for you, but you still want to get this job, postpone the conversation for the future.  Discuss with your employer the possibility of future salary increases. <br><br>  <b>Discuss the planned results of your work for 60, 90 or 120 days.</b>  Discuss the possibility of a minimum percentage wage increase. <br><br>  <b>Discuss the size of the bonus</b> that you receive at the end of the year. <br><br>  <b>Discuss the possibility of signing a contract</b> for a one-time bonus. <br><br>  Being well prepared and confident, you can easily master the art of negotiating wages.  You will feel comfortable and be able to negotiate an acceptable compensation package.  Do not doubt, employers understand your point of view, because once they were also in your place.  Remember that you need to know the size of salaries in the industry, be persistent in what suits or does not suit you, and also be open to discuss other forms of compensation.  If you pay attention to the tips outlined here, do some preliminary research of the wage market in your profession and industry, then rest assured that everything will end not only in obtaining the position you want, but also in the salary you deserve. <br><br><h5>  Instead of conclusion </h5><br>  We do not call right now to drop everything and go look for a new job.  Moreover, we believe that you have several clear advantages at your current place of work + there are likely unused opportunities, which we recommended to discuss with your management. <br><br>  But if now you are actively looking for work, we hope that the recommendations will be useful to you. <br><br>  In any case, we will be grateful for comments and feedback. <br><br>  PS Special thanks for the numerous comments on the article <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/stratoplan/blog/229957/">‚ÄúHow to discuss money with management or why do careers sometimes stop?‚Äù</a> <br><br>  Unfortunately, now we do not have time to answer everyone.  On Monday, July 20, we will try to publish explanations to the article and answers to the most frequent questions + let's talk about how to discuss money issues with the applicant at the interview so that the question is taken up from all sides :) <br><br>  PPS Blog Stratoplana moved to a separate site: <a href="http://blog.stratoplan.ru/">http://blog.stratoplan.ru</a> - see you there! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/230255/">https://habr.com/ru/post/230255/</a></p>
