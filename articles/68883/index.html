  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Easy way to get familiar with Ubuntu</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This article is intended for those who want for the sake of interest or to replenish their knowledge in the field of work with Linux-systems, it is safe to install Ubuntu or another distribution kit of this family.  I understand that most people on Habr√© are experienced users / administrators / programmers, but still I hope that the article will be useful to those who do not have all this knowledge, but really want to get them :) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Some time ago, I wanted to get to know the Ubuntu family more closely, but I was too lazy to tinker with the partitioning of hard disk partitions, etc.  for the sake of simple pampering.  After installing on a virtual machine and a small overview of the system, there was a desire to install it as a second, but I still did not want to waste time partitioning the disk. <br><br>  After a bit of wandering around the internet, I came across <a href="http://wubi-installer.org/">wubi</a> .  This simple utility was created just for those who want to fully and safely try Ubuntu.  Why is it safe?  Because it allows you to install the system without affecting the existing partition structure of the hard disk.  That is, you can not be afraid of accidentally, by mistake or lack of experience, to lose data when repartitioning a hard drive.  When installing, wubi creates a file of the size you selected as the partition on which the system will be installed.  When starting, the wubi bootloader connects it as a full disk, then everything will be loaded from it.  You can safely install Ubuntu and do anything with it.  When you get bored, you can simply go to ‚ÄúAdd / Remove Programs‚Äù in the Windows Control Panel and remove it.

      When installing this way we get a fully working system.  The only restriction that I noticed is that it does not see the directory structure of the partition on which it is installed.  That is, if you put it, say, on the C drive, then under Ubuntu you will not be able to see it.  The remaining discs will be available.  There is also a slight decrease in file system performance, since the OS works with the file on NTFS, and not the disk.  Although she does not know about it :) <br><br>  By running wubi, you can choose which Ubuntu family you want to install.  After selecting all the necessary parameters, wubi downloads the installation image from the official site (if you already have an image - just put it in the same directory where wubi is located), create a file partition and add a new item to the OS boot menu, choosing which you will download Ubuntu  By the way, wubi allows you to install only the desktop version of * buntu.  Server is not supported, as well as netbook-remix. <br><img src="http://hobotam.org.ua/wp-content/gallery/posts/ubuntu.png"><br><br>  Now a little about the problems.  When I tried to install the Russian version of Ubuntu right away, I ran into a funny bug.  Even under Windows wubi gives an error and crashes.  When installing the English and Ukrainian versions (others have not tried it) everything is fine.  On some computers, it also for some reason refuses to install in the system partition (drive C as a rule).  It just hangs when creating a partition file.  After restarting wubi and choosing another partition to install, the problem disappears.  As for the installation of Ubuntu itself after wubi completed all the necessary actions, I did not have any problems with it. <br><br>  That's basically it.  From myself I want to note that this is a great option for exploring Linux as such. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/68883/">https://habr.com/ru/post/68883/</a></p>
