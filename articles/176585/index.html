      Observant people probably paid attention to the presence of the beloved blue electrical tape on the phone case, and this is no accident. <a name="habracut"></a>  The main disadvantage of the Lumia 920 is the presence of the ‚ÄúSearch‚Äù button.  Since the purchase on December 29, 2012, it is not used for its intended purpose, but has managed to spoil the mood many times when you take the phone in your hands to call and not to look.  The techie has the first thought: a paper clip or duct tape.  The clip is used to extract the SIM, therefore - electrical tape.  But the test showed that the fraud did not pass: the praised sensitivity of the screen does not fail and the search is still activated.  We can not spend, use two layers.  But here is a fiasco.  Only a sandwich of eight layers of insulation tape with a total thickness of 1.2 mm made it possible to almost completely paralyze the button, even with high sensitivity of the display, now you can live in peace! <br>  In this regard, a huge <b>request 1</b> to the developers: make it possible in the settings to disable the ‚ÄúSearch‚Äù button for those who are not looking, but have already found it.  Then the number of people who have found this model will only grow.  And the more owners of this device will go with a piece of tape, the faster the developers will meet the wishes of users.  <b>Flashmob ‚ÄúInsulating tape‚Äù is declared open!</b> <br><br>  The phone does not have an optical zoom, but due to the high sensitivity of the photo, autofocus and a smart stabilizer, the simplest telescope turns the smartphone into a tool for photo hunting.  It is only necessary to fix everything securely.  This was done in the latest (at the moment) project ‚Äú <b>telescope</b> ‚Äù.  The idea is not new in the field of phones, I read that devices for connecting the telescope to the phone are sold, but I have a new phone model, and the pipe is old, so I had to <a href="https://plus.google.com/photos/116668088451857322516/albums/5865570470857728001">design it</a> myself.  Used: 920th, " <a href="http://www.detect-ufo.narod.ru/pribor/optopribori/04_pribori_nabludeniya/1_04.html">Tourist-5</a> ", some pieces of iron, mounting of a polypropylene pipe with a diameter of 32 mm: 2 pcs.  3 rubles each, silicone gasket, diameter 29/18 mm (between the pipe and the phone): 3 rubles.  Total costs amounted to 9 rubles. <br>  Now you can do a winter photography. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/CDyUfaIQ0Og%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhitdUnOXTCTQfiDqEpY1XK1BCapwQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The principle of operation of the camera-telephone bundle is well narrated by voice-over.  The voice belongs to the girl, who, like many passers-by, saw a new design, approached, was interested, shared impressions, and even steered a little.  The video clearly shows the movement of air above the surface of the ice.  When viewing the far bank of the Volga, the haze even seems to be a current of water, but this is only a mirage shot with a mobile phone camera. <br>  This model of the pipe does not have a large increase, now some cameras are ‚Äúshooting it,‚Äù but the principles used in the design allow us to do the same for more powerful devices.  Then it will be possible to observe not only the Sun and the Moon, but also other objects, as well as to meet fully armed new eclipses in HD mode. <br><br>  The last but one project is <b>for phone studios</b> .  The task is to get a new amateur point of view without the use of a professional camera crane, as well as to take photographs with active movement with turns and displacements in height.  Implementing the idea helped the stabilizer of the smartphone (without it would be tight) and a bit of different pieces of hardware. <br>  The design uses two options for holding the phone: <br>  - long boom: 2.5 meters (optimal for transportation in the car); <br>  - short handle with a rotating axis. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c8e/0dc/e1d/c8e0dce1d61601866e6b17ad114e8943.jpg"><br><br>  The smartphone is mounted on the top or bottom of the bent rod set. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0e6/90d/b0b/0e690db0bedf7aaf8cf718eecc09961e.jpg"><br><br>  The phone takes a horizontal position, since the center of gravity of the structure is located well below the point of suspension, which is a ball joint. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/23f/37f/22c/23f37f22cc1371dd462bddd6939b4814.jpg"><br><br>  People who saw an unfamiliar mounting mechanism first ask: ‚ÄúWhy does the phone not fall off the ball, is it a magnet?‚Äù No, everything is held only by gravity and a small rim above the ball.  And safety rope just in case of fire. <br>  Surprise is also turning the camera.  Initially, the rotation was supposed to use rope thrust, attached to the two holes in the plate above the ball.  But it turned out that everything rotates easily when you turn the ball around the axis.  This interesting effect was applied further. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZoNuqclvT9U%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhibCYbAlBXAgmGYysISV0ZSxrrpHQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Stadikam can be collected by looking at additional <a href="https://plus.google.com/photos/116668088451857322516/albums/5865557652651728033">photos</a> and reading <div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">description</b> <div class="spoiler_text"> <br>  Long rod: chrome-plated steel pipe: L 2500 mm, D 25 mm, wall thickness 0.7 mm.  At the end of the pipe - carbon tube D 19 mm, L protrusion.  56 mm.  The tube is attached to the ball H 22 mm, D 30 mm from the ball valve VT.218.N.05.  To protect against damage, it is covered with foam material. <br>  Short handle with a rotating axis: part of a hollow handle from a Bosh electric drill GSB 13 RE Professional. <br>  Axis: a stud with a length of 190 mm and a diameter of 8 mm with thread along the entire length.  The thread in the lower part, protruding from the body by 25 mm, is closed with a heat shrinkable tube for easy rotation. <br>  The distance from the top of the handle to the bottom of the ball is 30 mm.  Carbon tube "planted" on the nuts M8.  Bearings 628 RS CRAFT fasten the self-locking nuts.  Under bearings, a shrink tube with a diameter of 10 mm is placed on the axle to remove a small gap.  The gap between the outer side of the bearing and the inner part of the handle is removed with the help of three self-adhesive tapes glued along the length of the handle.  To prevent the axle and bearings from falling out of the case, a gear from the laser printer cartridge is fixed in the lower part of the handle. <br>  For the ball, the landing platform is made of a Teflon washer and a brass fragment of a ball valve where this washer was located.  Using three screws, the fragment is attached to a stainless plate 1 mm thick.  The heads of the screws are located on the side of the plate, the threaded part is twisted into a brass piece and ends under a teflon washer. <br>  Plate bent into a corner.  The second corner shelf is attached to the bent rod.  Bent rod for counterweight is made of metalplastic pipe 16x2, 680 mm long.  After shaping, the distance from the landing plate to the lower metal plate was 600 mm in a straight line.  The pipe is attached using a slightly modified crimp fitting - a 16x1 / 2 straight connector with an external thread. <br>  On the lower part of the pipe, with the help of an M8 screw located in a compression fitting, a weight of 700 ... 800 grams is fixed, made of a steel plate with a thickness of 20 mm.  The dimensions of the plate and cutout are determined by the dimensions of the phone and the location of the camera.  Nuts in the lower part allow you to fix the plate in any convenient position. <br>  Landing pads for the phone are plastered with the material used in the sizing of the car and covered on top with a layer of black Madeleine. <br></div></div><br>  It turns out a little more expensive than with a telescope, but not more than 500 rubles. <br>  A huge advantage in the horizontal placement of the phone on the set is the lack of hardware buttons on the bottom side. <br>  Stadikam used to shoot winter races on the lake. <br><br>  With the help of a long barbell, a film was made where the phone flew right above the machines. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/rg5dXbdU2kI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgTHGq13akaQrVBs8lc1uNC9QweMA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The smartphone was placed on the lower platform (the top one at that moment was not yet) and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Duj0RJzskxeU%26feature%3Dshare%26list%3DUUjY9m4BQ-UoM-1AysobLdag">hit</a> the initial frames of the recorder installed in the cab of one of the participants' cars. <br>  The mode of the phone is ‚Äúon the plane‚Äù, which means not only the disconnection of communications, but also its real location. <br>  The air temperature at the beginning of filming is -15 degrees, at the end of the competition -8 degrees. <br>  In total, before the phone was completely discharged, the video was taken with interruptions for warming, with a total duration of 2 hours and 10 minutes in the high quality mode 1080p.  The competition lasted more than six hours. <br>  A pleasant surprise was that after the battery was discharged and the camera stopped automatically (I did not see this moment), the last plot was recorded. <br>  <b>Conclusions after shooting.</b> <br>  1. The operation of the camera and the microphone of the phone - no complaints.  Pay attention to the undistorted sound quality in a large volume range and video in the evening, when the phone did not lose the entry-level SLR. <br>  2. Dodge and divert the phone from flying machines had to be very intense, slippery felt boots with rubber soles and drifts also did not contribute to a stable image, but the phone coped with these factors.  I think that in the summer everything will be much better.  In terms of pitching, the stabilizer worked on the ‚Äúsolid five‚Äù. <br>  3. First, the quality of the stabilizer assessed YouTube.  His analyzer, which often says that the image is unstable and offers to correct it, this time modestly kept silent.  Hence, fluctuations in the normal range. <br>  4. Notes on the suspension - reduce vibrations.  The heavier the load, the smaller the amplitude of the oscillations and the faster the time of calm, but the faster the fatigue occurs. <br>  5. When the phone is at the bottom, the total weight with a load is about a kilogram, which has a positive effect on reducing vibrations, but flying around the windows of cars must be very careful. <br>  6. The longer the bar, the more interesting the plots, but the heavier the work.  Try to hold for a long time the iron on the outstretched hand. <br>  7. For a flying phone, it is advisable to use scenes and points of view that are inaccessible to traditional types of shooting. <br>  8. It is necessary to obtain an image from the camera while shooting on the screen of the second phone, since the shooting is performed almost blindly, and it becomes difficult to monitor the composition of the frame.  <b>Request 2</b> to software developers: write an application for broadcasting video from the camera of the phone via Wi-Fi to the screen of the neighboring phone, then the number of spies in our country will increase significantly. <br>  9. When the phone is near the snow, the sound of background music from the speakers on the lake is greatly reduced. <br>  10. If you work as an operator with a barbell, then you can not go to the gym. <br><br>  With a short pen was shot the second part of the film: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/IbLwwf6A_rU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhh5Ns9ClMvvSdbymcQd2Kt_0ou79A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The first part was shot with the help of the modernized Parrot Ar.Drone 2.0, in it, with a flick of the wrist, the front camera turned into the lower one. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/95d/e15/a46/95de15a461dff0596932f5fb75adc88e.jpg"><br><br>  Thanks to this video, you can compare the work of the HD cameras of the drone and the phone, evaluate the shooting against the Sun. <br>  <b>Request 3</b> to software developers - write a Parrot Ar.Drone 2.0 management application for WP8!  Then you can fly with the help of Lumia, and now you have to carry a tablet with you. <br><br>  <b>How did the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãflying.</b> <br>  Almost immediately after the purchase of the phone, <a href="http://youtu.be/L7g5-Gw1IQI">on</a> January <a href="http://youtu.be/Q1I60uKfKWI">3</a> and <a href="http://youtu.be/L7g5-Gw1IQI">5</a> , dog sledding races were held.  The camera decided not to take it, but to test a new phone.  It was a classic shot from the hands.  The sound was recorded perfectly, the image stabilizer worked perfectly, but in the white balance settings there was an auto mode and sometimes the automatics did not cope - color changes are visible. <br>  The video clearly shows that the phone is not at all afraid of dogs, as well as they are his.  Therefore, a thought arose: if the phone has such a smart stabilizer, then you can ‚Äúthrow‚Äù it directly onto the track with the help of something, as operators do it with microphones, bringing them closer to the source of events.  This was something old six-meter telescopic rod. <br>  Thus, the lack of optical zoom is compensated by approaching the phone directly to the subject. <br>  Dogs sped away, but the guys arrived on snowmobiles.  On this day, January 13 (half a month after the purchase), the baptism of a flying phone at minus 15 degrees occurred.  More than 2 minutes of phone flights have got into the frames of the <a href="http://youtu.be/JHvvcLKrq0c%3Ft%3D2m31s">film</a> .  This time the white balance was set to ‚Äúcloudy‚Äù and the phone worked successfully.  No wonder that video is considered one of the strengths of the 920th model. <br>  This was written by the article ‚Äú <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/167277/">Flying Phone</a> ‚Äù, where it was described in detail about the shooting conditions.  In the same article, the film ‚Äú <a href="http://youtu.be/xPdSuNqjau4">Flying Phone</a> ‚Äù was also shown, where Lumia 920 flew in very extreme conditions, after which the daughter suggested that the phone would not die with its death.  But never mind, almost 4 months have passed since the purchase, and at least we are still flying! <br><br>  Many thanks to those who supported and appreciated the article and the film ‚ÄúFlying Telephone‚Äù.  The film showed plots that can be shot using this technology and a phone with an excellent stabilizer, but due to the weak stabilizing capabilities of the platform, it had image vibrations. <br>  Your tips, comments, links, survey results ‚ÄúAre cell phone adaptations interesting for extending its field of use?‚Äù Allowed us to create stadiaks for a cell phone that has better characteristics than the first versions and is easily accessible for repetition and improvement.  From the old system, only the Lumia 920 remained. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> <br>  1. Competitive <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/special/nokia/lumia/post/1413/">article published</a> in the blog Nokia. <br>  2.
