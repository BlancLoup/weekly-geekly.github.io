The main advantage of the service is the HTML 5 language, i.e.  support for modern page layout standards. <br>  Useful Wix applications include: the ability to pay through popular payment systems (e-Commerce application), an application that allows you to attract visitors from social networks (SMO marketing application), the ability to change any area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe page using Drag &amp; Drop.  Platform tariffs are higher than competitors.  But it is possible to create a website for free, though with advertising from Wix (the usual condition of the platforms).  Your domain can be connected only on a paid basis. <br><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="http://www.setup.ru/">Setup</a></b> </li></ul><br>  The Russian development of 2011, which impressed users and jury who conducted Runet 2012 rating. There is almost everything here: news feeds, the possibility of webinars, interactive feedback from site visitors, SEO promotion in the main search engines (Google and Yandex). <br>  Creating websites is free, at paid rates you can get the possibility of opening an online store, expand disk space, put selling triggers, etc.  There is a unique opportunity to order an "eternal tariff" and get these benefits forever. <br><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="http://ru.jimdo.com/">Jimdo</a></b> </li></ul><br>  Long-lived international project, whose main residences are located in Hamburg, San Francisco, Tokyo.  Developed platform where you can find almost anything, implemented on modern standards of HTML5 and CSS3. <br>  The user gets control of individual modules, changes in site navigation, guarantees of data protection and site security, blog activation and the ability to manage reviews.  The site is created for free, for registration and support of 1 or 2 domains, running a business or creating a store, payment is required. <br><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="http://umi.ru/">Umi</a></b> </li></ul><br>  Modern Russian cloud-based service.  You get: managing your own domain in the umi.ru zone, the ability to synchronize with the 1C and Yandex.Market database systems, the payment aggregator, which binds the possibility of payment in the well-known payment systems - PayOnline, <br>  The platform has a very simple and intuitive interface, extensive design possibilities and ease of perception.  Disadvantages will annoy only those who are accustomed to do everything "with their own hands."  You will not have access to the site code and block access via FTP, that is, it is not easy to make a large batch file download. <br><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="http://www.a5.ru/">A5</a></b> </li></ul><br>  An interesting project in 2011, which implied the training of beginners in the art of creating websites. <br>  The platform itself provides ready-made layouts that you can immediately use, as well as: the ability to connect to your own domain system, add various visiting counters, HTML widgets, connect corporate e-mail (paid service).  Among the disadvantages are the low traffic for downloading information.  Yet the project was planned not as a worker, but as a training in the first place. <br><br><h5>  <b>Total</b> </h5><br>  Each of these systems solves the problem of creating a site in its own way; you just have to choose what suits your business specificity. <br>  For example, the art salon has a fairly stable platform with the ability to change images.  While the online cosmetics store will need: dynamic change of resource, work with reviews, feedback and the possibility of consultation, with which SetUp can help.  Basic features and low prices are offered by UMI and A5.  The ability to work with a blog and guarantee the protection of the site will provide "Jimdo".  The abundance of templates and simple settings for a one-page landing can provide ‚ÄúWix‚Äù, but for a great price. <br><br><h6>  <b>Promotional PS</b> </h6><br>  To increase sales, it is necessary not only to attract high-quality traffic to the site, but also to increase the number of <b>hits</b> from the site.  This can be achieved if the channel for feedback is noticeable, easy to use and ‚Äúworking‚Äù (Ie, it will be able to quickly provide customers with the necessary information while they are on the product page. That, on average, takes from 30 seconds to 2 minutes) . <br><br>  With an active feedback form on the site, your customers will receive quick advice, and you will increase sales and calls.  Try it yourself and make sure the widget is effective! <br>  For <b>Habr's</b> readers, we offer a <b><a href="http://cashmyvisit.com/%3Futm_source%3DhabrhabrPlatform%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3DCashMyVisit">month of the test period</a></b> instead of the usual 7-day test! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/301458/">https://habr.com/ru/post/301458/</a></p>
