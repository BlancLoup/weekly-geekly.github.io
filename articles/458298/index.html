Finally, they completed and installed an artillery object with solar panels yesterday for the ‚ÄúEngineers of the Future 2019‚Äù forum.  In the <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/455968/">first part</a> I have already described the whole idea with calculations, estimates with drawings. <br><br>  It began, oddly enough, not from welding the frame, but from receiving and assembling the lighting component - the solar panels were received before they could buy the metal - the post of Russia pleases. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/le/b_/23/leb_23wsyj_nbsdnvko795toggu.jpeg">

      On the photo is unpacking the parcel from Vladivostok, which reached for 3 days via EMS. Everything was packed neatly. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nx/4x/kn/nx4xknrjyktewqksu2vxp2o4fwq.jpeg"><br><br>  And then I waited for a small bummer: the supplier‚Äôs website did not indicate the photo of the panel in the profile.  Rather, the very profile.  It turns out, "n" -shaped. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tx/u5/66/txu566db5kqacea9zdsbkp-6biy.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7u/nx/is/7unxison-ov7rxnmmkfmgaqr_h0.jpeg"><br><br>  I had to "collective farm" with the installation of panels. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ct/uh/ot/ctuhot1xudzytueq3yebathqiza.jpeg"><br><br>  The next surprise: having opened a junction box of a 50-watt panel, I discovered some kind of diode or resistor.  I did not understand what it is.  It seems that Schottky diodes should be soldered in series into the positive wire, and then the contacts are tied directly.  Maybe some kind of a ballast from a short circuit was decided by me and ... I still soldered the diodes (it won't be superfluous). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/eb/yt/w2/ebytw2qh1gzjbkvktnyenfy7wws.jpeg"><br><br>  Oddly enough, on 30 watt solar panels there is no such thing in the box <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bk/ww/ul/bkwwuly2i33llqsob17wwruykqg.jpeg"><br><br>  We were pleased with the anti-glare texture of the protective glass. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zw/e8/tq/zwe8tq0lecqbg7i4lz3u1s8oevs.jpeg"><br><br>  Wiring box 30-watt panels. <br><br>  After connecting the wires just for reliability filled with hot melt and took the Schottky diodes.  The fact is that such a problem we have in Orenburg to find diodes for a current of 5 amps, which had to take 30 amps on two channels and an extra leg after soldering to bite off. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/du/bn/6d/dubn6d_anheuvxwvehuxeyr8kmq.jpeg"><br><br>  So another day passed, and the proftrubs for the framework were never brought.  Well, but there is a base plate, which means we can do mortgage so far!  I cut the ‚Äútwenties‚Äù of the pins, screwed them to the drilled plate and ‚Äútied‚Äù them with reinforcement, welded to the support frame. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dx/gu/pj/dxgupjpranyaglqgvhayxte3uec.jpeg"><br><br>  It is important: before cutting the studs, tighten the nuts in advance, otherwise it will be difficult to fit on the jammed thread. <br><br>  The whole next day was spent on the assembly of formwork and pouring concrete. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7i/6-/m8/7i6-m88oucf3lkhltsnflx4y8sa.jpeg"><br><br>  Another one of my ‚Äúcant‚Äù - I forgot that the base plate will sit on top, which means the mounting lugs from the reinforcement are superfluous.  Then I had to cut them off. <br><br>  That's what happened after the concrete had hardened, and I, breaking the formwork, threw a decorative artificial grass cover from above, glued in an hour. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vs/_c/ud/vs_cudwpjaqthadiuzhxdnoo3hu.jpeg"><br><br>  In the meantime, another contractor printed with UV ink the front and back parts of the milled composite sheets. <br><br><br><br>  And the next day, all the stars came together and we still got hold of the metal, including the bent proftruboy.  Oddly enough, this time the contractor did not disappoint and made pipe bending exactly and in size. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qm/g2/qa/qmg2qamcv7e15wmuidzpkpz_9m4.jpeg"><br><br>  Our welder welded on a printed pattern, so as not to make a mistake even by a millimeter.  And even in this case, after we gathered the sectors together and threw a composite, we saw discrepancies of several centimeters.  They did not take into account that during welding the metal ‚Äúplayed‚Äù as it were from heating. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8u/u8/cg/8uu8cg5gc9csxbnp6wzewx1ixo0.jpeg"><br><br>  In fact, I had to adjust, straighten, digest, push, etc. It took another day to fit. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ax/oa/fl/axoafly1u7rhcyxf5e1svtmsvsw.jpeg"><br><br>  Here, the main work is finished, the frame is exposed and tedious, long plating with composite has begun.  First, threw the front and back parts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/d6/qi/jy/d6qijydjco6xwqkz2nszesqgwe0.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xn/lq/sj/xnlqsjuvbde4mvi3iaosowrlu_s.jpeg"><br><br>  As planned, the chopik of PVC stuck on the cosmophen to the composite from the reverse side, and only then screwed it with screws to the proftrab. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1a/ea/ng/1aeangg1y2h6a0j9mgvr-ydc3ne.jpeg"><br><br>  Here‚Äôs how it looks from the inside: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ru/9v/zy/ru9vzyune07_9ky1-6lfgvxiaei.jpeg"><br><br>  The 8-10 mm square PVC chopik holds the composite panel, while the upper ones create a support for the future end-spreaded panels. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/k1/s1/pc/k1s1pcj8ksnmwkpkzxy2lgrjdv4.jpeg"><br><br>  The lining of the frame itself took almost 4 (!) Days.  There was little time left.  Installation time has shifted slightly.  Well, that took with the stock. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/r2/lr/kj/r2lrkjkrdri-vn6fmntpkx9e9u4.jpeg"><br><br>  In the meantime, while the guys sheathed the frame, so as not to waste time in vain, I decided to throw solar panels on the teeth.  Cut galvanized strips 0.8 mm thick and screwed to the wrong side of the profile of the panels, we got such brackets. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yh/-m/wk/yh-mwkeniqgugvjireaenj7l9xq.jpeg"><br><br>  He was afraid that it would be very flimsy and not vandal-proof, but after screwing it from the inside, pulling it to the frame, it was not to tear off the panel.  Everything holds very tight. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pd/1b/y2/pd1by2zohszqkbk2ynywpx_mjo0.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_r/ka/eh/_rkaeh0gbezg-a6inugl2jpxu1q.jpeg"><br><br>  The upper solar panels, 30-watt, and therefore narrow, placed in the center of the tooth, as planned, making "doborki" of the same white composite. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ln/fe/3q/lnfe3q6gcouwspwdku8qtttyta0.jpeg"><br><br>  In the photo below you can see that I collected all the wiring to the WAGO terminals.  Very handy during assembly and disassembly.  After all, the design must be quick-collapsible (2 hours), since it will travel to Samara after 3 weeks at an exhibition of art objects. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nu/n7/-o/nun7-o3kravm2wr_qvfuzagqvq4.jpeg"><br><br>  Button on / off lights hidden under the lower tooth. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/al/9j/cj/al9jcjouvf1s4mvapv-2iaihckg.jpeg"><br><br>  And on the reverse side I just filled it with the same hot melt glue, so that it certainly would not fall out, no matter how hard they pressed it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/f7/69/aq/f769aqhg--vtkogtucah3sqkmum.jpeg"><br><br>  That's all.  It is a great montage day.  And then (well, how can it be without this) another CANT!  The fact is that I have a construction of 3.2 m in height.  And it turns out there is a standard for the transport of large-size.  Not more than 3 m (this is subject to the height of the body of the manipulator itself) to move around the city. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/i8/in/pz/i8inpzes3dogzpufkzvpdyitxd4.jpeg"><br><br>  I had to boil the support frame to the frame and hang one ‚Äúleg‚Äù outside the body.  So they took it, grabbing it with traps. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/j-/bk/9w/j-bk9wjf-cj319eoduv_ozecobs.jpeg"><br><br>  When our ‚Äúproduct‚Äù was being carried around the city, every now and then they were afraid of passing through the next intersection: no matter how touched the trolleybus wires. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jo/3z/up/jo3zupg7ojzq59pzxbuaejy8stk.jpeg"><br><br>  But, having arrived at the installation site at the Yantar children's camp, everything went like clockwork.  We unload the supports on the prepared soil, put our half-gear on them, bait the studs and fasten them with nuts, and now, it remains only to adjust the level and connect everything as it should. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vs/9c/ok/vs9cok0lsex4tvx6fi4iwrjqdfg.jpeg"><br><br>  Pay attention to one "paw": this is a door for removing the battery "for the winter." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/05/kl/ys/05klyss5v6tppywn-pcmiwlw0fy.jpeg"><br><br>  He poured the main frames of the ASG and connected the battery - it all worked.  The charge current is on.  All the lights are on, the USB ports charge the mobile. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-l/gy/qo/-lgyqohbcgm30lyypiqowzmbwe8.jpeg"><br><br>  The real power did not measure, but according to calculations, even if it is not a very sunny day, the charge should be enough for two nights to supply 5 pcs 7 watt, 12 volt light bulbs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ps/sd/d1/pssdd15csvcazohabzecr2enwzu.jpeg"><br><br>  After the final ‚Äúclosing‚Äù of the panels of the facility, I walked around the joints with a sealant and removed the protective film from the composite ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mh/oq/kk/mhoqkkaqysmvwxa4ovu7agj8lxo.jpeg"><br><br>  ... and sprinkled all the support arc again with sand and gravel, which would not be evident.  Some commentators in the first part of the story expressed doubts about the stability of this design.  I tell you - it is monolithic.  Each of the concrete pillars weighs about 250 kg - the four of us, barely tearing at our feet, displaced them.  Next, the frame itself weighs about 250 kg.  According to the calculations of wind loads - all the rules. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ie/cc/rw/ieccrww1fu-jwkztxuypaltqznu.jpeg"><br><br>  In addition, I was afraid that they would climb on the gear to make a selfie and sway, but it turned out to be not so convenient to jump on it. <br>  And the forum organizers actually built up video cameras on almost every birch tree.  So I am calm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/p8/aw/ws/p8awws5agpusrmbi1kfhxuudbxe.jpeg"><br><br>  Well that's all.  Please do not kick much, in my opinion it turned out very badly, but constructive criticism is welcome.  I will continue to continue to promote alternative energy to the masses.  Now you need to try something to stir up with a wind turbine.  Fortunately, they are made near us near Orenburg.  Waiting for your hot comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/458298/">https://habr.com/ru/post/458298/</a></p>
