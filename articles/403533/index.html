The meat industry is trying to convince the public of the harmlessness of saturated fat</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/292/44f/c7d/29244fc7db4333115bf5fffd3dfd9ae1.jpg"><br><br>  Harm of saturated fats (fatty meat, butter, cheese, lard) for the human cardiovascular system is considered to be a generally accepted fact among nutritionists.  On this subject, published many scientific papers and studies.  There are <a href="https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/dga95/lowfat.htm">recommendations from the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion</a> , a <a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/InteractiveNutritionFactsLabel/saturated-fat.html">certificate from the Food and Drug Administration of the USA</a> , and <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Goodfood/Pages/Eat-less-saturated-fat.aspx">recommendations from the UK Public Health Service</a> .  In the end, there <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs394/ru/">is the World Health Organization newsletter</a> , where all this is popularly interpreted.  Nevertheless, scientific studies are periodically published, the authors of which try to disprove this fact and prove the harmlessness of saturated fats.  But the truth comes out when it turns out who sponsors this research. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Some media outlets again bought into an article by the British cardiologist Aseem Malhotra, which has long been irritating scientists, experts and nutritionists around the world who have been studying the connection of saturated fats and diseases of the cardiovascular system for decades, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/04/experts-headline-grabbing-editorial-on-saturated-fats-bizarre-misleading/">writes</a> <i>Ars Technica</i> . <br><br>  The media published information with reference to the "authoritative" specialist Malhotra, who claims that meat and saturated fat are completely harmless.  This cardiologist has long been promoting the idea that high fat diets do not harm health.  Supposedly the epidemic of obesity and other health problems in people entirely caused by the added sugar and other processed foods.  In fact, sausages and sausages <a href="http://www.who.int/features/qa/cancer-red-meat/ru/">are included by WHO in Group 1 of products that are carcinogenic to humans</a> - they actually contribute to the <a href="http://www.who.int/features/qa/cancer-red-meat/ru/">development</a> of cancers, like all other products from processed meat.  At the same time, red meat is still in group 2A of ‚Äúprobably carcinogenic products‚Äù.  Meat research is not yet complete.  But this does not at all exclude the harm of saturated fats by themselves, which has long been well studied.

      The activities of Asem Malhotra are contrary to the scientific consensus on this topic - and may therefore be attracting media attention.  Many publications want to tell the "fried facts" that fatty meat is a harmless product.  When such sensational news (about the harmlessness of fatty meat, nicotine or low doses of alcohol) appears, they are immediately picked up by tabloids and ‚Äúyellow‚Äù media.  Assem Malhotra says what the masses want to hear. <br><br>  The British cardiologist has repeatedly published articles on the safety of fatty meats and saturated fats: here is his <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24149521">column</a> in a scientific journal from 2013, here is another <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4555071/">scientific article</a> about how a sudden change in diet and quitting smoking immediately reduces the risks of cardiovascular diseases, regardless of calories. <br><br>  Recently, ‚Äúone of the most influential cardiologists in the UK‚Äù even <a href="http://doctoraseem.com/">filmed a documentary</a> . <br><br>  And now Malhotra issued another editorial article, which will certainly be referred to in support of the view that saturated fats are harmless to health.  An editorial was <a href="http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/early/2017/03/31/bjsports-2016-097285">published</a> March 31, 2017 in the <i>British Journal of Sports Medicine</i> (doi: 10.1136 / bjsports-2016-097285).  Judging by the counter on the site, it has already been replicated by 12 major media outlets, plus 45 mentions on Twitter, that is, the replication process has begun. <br><br>  In this opus, Malhotra assures that saturated fats do not clog the arteries, and coronary heart disease is a chronic inflammatory condition, the risk of which can be reduced due to a healthy lifestyle.  The cardiologist advises to eat "real food" and stick to the Mediterranean diet.  Of course, he does not explain what ‚Äúreal food‚Äù is. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e7d/0a9/4c1/e7d0a94c1830457d8df2d9623d1b6328.jpg"><br><br>  Strange, but in the article a cardiologist promotes the Mediterranean diet, because this diet <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/mediterranean-diet/art-20047801%3Fpg%3D2">requires <i>minimal</i> intake of saturated fat</a> . <br><br>  The report is presented by the <a href="http://www.nationalobesityforum.org.uk/">National Anti-Obesity Forum</a> , where Malhotra is listed as a senior advisor.  This organization is <a href="http://www.nationalobesityforum.org.uk/index.php/about-the-nof/our-partners.html">funded by the meat industry and pharmaceutical companies</a> . <br><br>  The conclusions of the scientific article are based on meta-analysis and observational studies.  Scientists criticized the methods and results of this study, pointing to the poor quality of the source data.  To date, there have been a lot of high-quality randomized controlled clinical trials that clearly indicate that reducing saturated fat intake reduces cholesterol levels and reduces the likelihood of heart attacks.  For example, here is an <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD011737/abstract">analysis of 15 studies</a> in which 59,000 people were taken in total.  It shows that reducing saturated fat in a diet lowers the risk of cardiovascular events (including disease and stroke) by 17%. <br><br>  Nutritionists say there are no ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúbad‚Äù foods.  There is a general <a href="https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/guidelines/">method of healthy eating</a> - these are habits that must be adhered to.  So from time to time you can eat bacon or shashlik.  The main thing is not to abuse. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/403533/">https://habr.com/ru/post/403533/</a></p>
