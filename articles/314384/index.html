Start</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  You are on the threshold of a new organization and you face the complex task of launching a new equipment, system and / or program.  We skip the sales component and go directly to the study of the problem, where our project is outlined by budget, deadlines and tasks.  It is important not to forget that one facet of a successful launch is the psychology of entering a project and interacting with employees.  After all, any technology is controlled by a person, and it is with him that the primary contact for data collection will occur. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  From the story marked "secret": <br><br>  The most disastrous project with my participation was in servicing the daughter of an oil producing enterprise.  The project manager on the part of the customer, who is also the chief accountant, didn‚Äôt stint on sharp remarks about his colleagues and me in his ‚Äúlittle over 20‚Äù years.  There was disgust when the abuse was addressed to their own employees, where, for example, the secretary was ‚Äúbychara‚Äù due to excessive weight.  My project survey interview had a functional response: ‚ÄúSee for yourself!‚Äù.  At first, I was emotionally shocked and I was looking for ways to solve this situation.  Perhaps I searched for a long time, because negative fluids flew all over the room during our ‚Äúcommunication‚Äù, and I was removed from the project with a crash at an extended meeting as an illiterate specialist. <br></blockquote><br>  But this is all the author's opinion, that is, it is subjective and subject to doubt.  This will be the first rule that I learned for myself in the process of entering the project and getting acquainted with the company. <br><br><h4>  Do not take anyone‚Äôs word until they are confirmed by facts.  Doubt to the last </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6b2/8d4/299/6b28d429978e24034965bd2a77aff6a4.jpg" alt="podozrevat" width="750" height="501">

      We turn to more productive work on the project.  An example would be a conversation, where an employee states that the incoming information (customer order) for him is exclusively the uploading of data from the site. <br><br>  <em>- There are exceptions?</em>  <em>- sounded my question.</em> <br><br>  <em>- No ... - pause.</em>  <em>- Although, there is one special VIP-client who sends applications directly via email to Natalia Stepanovna.</em>  <em>This is our senior manager.</em> <br><br>  For you, this is an indicator of <strong>two different</strong> site architectures.  It is good if the ‚Äúpause‚Äù specified above is measured in seconds, rather than a period up to commissioning, where the lack of functionality will become clear.  We do not consider the trial on the subject of the wording of the technical task - it does not bring any of the parties closer to the goal.  Only if not <a href="http://www.forbes.ru/kompanii/potrebitelskii-rynok/251350-gnutsya-shvedy-kak-russkii-biznesmen-vybil-iz-ikea-25-mlrd-rubl">this case for 25 billion rubles</a> . <br><br>  In the process of obtaining information is required to ensure the completeness of the data.  Checklist for this event: <br><br><ol><li>  <strong>All</strong> copies of used paper documents and files were transferred. </li><li>  The testimony of witnesses.  It is better to conduct a conversation with a group of employees - process performers, because the collective mind often recalls the details in which the devil lives, according to the well-known English proverb (‚ÄúThe devil is in the detail‚Äù). </li><li>  Compiled sketches of processes and registry. </li><li>  An oral repetition of <strong>all the</strong> actions of the employee, which I marked in my notebook.  Like a waiter before placing an order. </li><li>  <strong>Important.</strong>  Signed employee (s) in the minutes of interviewing with an indication of a sketch of the business process, workflow, registry operations, etc.  Before the signature, as a rule, the interlocutor begins to re-run his eyes on the written text in an attempt to find the lost.  Signature adds responsibility. </li><li>  Intuition tells you that nothing has been hidden from you. </li></ol><br>  Why doubt?  So, among other things, it is human nature to err and not with malicious intent. <br><br><h4>  Do not be afraid to seem corrosive - this is a positive feature of any analyst (researcher) </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ca0/dff/99f/ca0dff99feae433a256d8004c98436bc.jpg" alt="microscope" width="750" height="500"><br><br>  Practical example: <br><br>  <em>- The entire issue, in addition to the program, we reflect in the magazines for production, - said the employee.</em> <br><br>  <em>- Why do I see 3 magazines?</em>  <em>- I ask a question.</em> <br><br>  <em>- Well, for registration of products A in the journal 1, products B, C, D in the journal 2, the rest of the products in the journal 3.</em> <br><br>  At this point, many analysts make a mistake and make the initial wording in the terms of reference.  Remember that a fivefold answer to the question "why" leads you to a true problematic. <br><br>  <em>- Why not use one magazine for all products?</em>  <em>- I ask, seeing that the structure of all magazines is similar.</em> <br><br>  <em>- In separate accounting it is easy for me to find the necessary order for production and other parameters.</em> <br><br>  <em>‚ÄúWhy look for them?‚Äù</em> <br><br>  <em>- If a request is received from the production director, dispatchers, masters.</em>  <em>Or made a marriage.</em> <br><br>  <em>- But you enter data into the program.</em>  <em>Can they see the required information there?</em> <br><br>  <em>- Yes.</em> <br><br>  <em>‚ÄúThen why are you doing this?‚Äù</em> <br><br>  <em>- These are the ****** rules!</em>  <em>They have all the information, but do not want ...</em> <br><br>  As mentioned above, the five-fold question ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù Helps to identify cause-effect relationships.  According to the information from Wikipedia " <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D1%258F%25D1%2582%25D1%258C_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D1%2583">Five Why</a> ", the Japanese entrepreneur <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D0%25BE%25D1%2591%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0,_%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8">Sakichi Toyoda</a> came up, although purely my opinion is from the category of psychoanalysis. <br><br><blockquote>  <em>Retreat.</em>  <em>Work through any of your fears on the described technique: "I am afraid (for example, to quit) ...".</em>  <em>Awareness of the root cause should reduce its impact on you and plan a roadmap of solutions.</em> <br></blockquote><br><h4>  At the survey stage, try to maintain a neutral relationship. </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/54d/a84/411/54da844115cfe71fb21bda9568f0e212.jpg" alt="5785443213_0c1a065264_b" width="750" height="545"><br><br>  <em>- Hello, my name is Sergey Kukanov.</em>  <em>Currently, I am conducting a survey of your company in order to further automate business processes and launch a new system.</em>  <em>I would like to talk with you about your responsibilities.</em>  <em>In the course of the conversation I will take notes, request copies of the documents that will be included in the survey report and the terms of reference.</em>  <em>Tell us a little about your work.</em> <br><br>  The reaction of the employee may be completely different.  Someone productively hold a conversation, and someone will scream that he has no time (the meeting is agreed).  Someone will be your friend, and someone to pour bile.  It is worth taking for granted that you will not have a good relationship with everyone, but this is normal for any team.  Remember that your goal is not to make friends, but to solve the task within the project and your responsibilities.  Moreover, <strong>friendly relations for a project carry more risks than neutral ones.</strong>  Examples: <br><br><ul><li>  He will offer you many features and ideas that may not fit into the concept of the project.  If you reject them, he may be hurt. </li><li>  Your friend will be looking forward to transfer all his professional experience and knowledge.  But you do not need this for the project. </li><li>  ‚ÄúSeryozh, look!  Make a green button here.  More green!  And to the left. "(This is not a design task).  If this is not the sponsor / customer of the project, then bold ignore.  If a sponsor, then you are at risk, which I described in <a href="http://ingraf.su/failure/">this publication</a> , as the wrong technology implementation. </li></ul><br>  <strong>In any respect, I</strong> recommend asking questions for your own analysis: <br><br><ul><li>  Why such a position of this employee? </li><li>  Does this make it difficult to achieve a local and global result? </li><li>  What are the risks and what are the possibilities to minimize them?  (add to your <strong>personal</strong> risk card) </li></ul><br>  In the next publication I will try to describe the observations that indicate the company's determination to change, as well as about the resistance of employees to the new. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9ed/f2e/ad2/9edf2ead29d0c01d78c3315a3b8436a1.jpg" alt="soprotivlenie-izmeneniyam" width="442" height="281"></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/314384/">https://habr.com/ru/post/314384/</a></p>
