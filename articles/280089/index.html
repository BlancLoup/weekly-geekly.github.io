When composing a program for DUMP and choosing speakers, we understood that we could not avoid such a situation.  But we really wanted to update these truths under the realities of today: with new technologies, attractive options for cooperation, a large number of start-ups and other complex projects. <br><br>  We invited speakers who will share the pain and stuffed bumps.  We hope that their experience will help to avoid some mistakes and teach you how to optimize work at no extra cost. <br><br>  To make the soap honey and fruit bast, we tried to go beyond the section and present reports in the near-interface space, because the projected interaction from UX to VR is design, and the ability to use techniques from related industries expands the capabilities of any specialist, especially a designer. <br><br>  I, as a program director of the section, art director and just a designer who loves what he does, I recommend to come and listen to reports to anyone who is at least somehow interested in technology and their development. <br><br>  And now more about what awaits us. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a45/5d9/86d/a455d986df0f6ebec71aaace119af88f.jpg" width="100" height="100" title="shuvaev.jpg" alt="shuvaev.jpg" align="left">  <b>UXD4Agile: managing user experience in flexible manufacturing</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Yaroslav Shuvaev, Alfa Mobile</b> <br>  Product Owner Alpha Mobile at Alfa Bank, curator of the UX &amp; UI intensive in the British Higher School of Design, using the example of Alfa Bank's mobile application, will tell you how to plan and implement improvements to the user experience of the product in a flexible production environment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c8f/60b/1d8/c8f60b1d884f0eb55bff1ef085dfabb3.jpg" width="100" height="100" title="ivanov.jpg" alt="ivanov.jpg" align="left">  <b>Difficulties of translation, or open eyes</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Anatoly Ivanov, Openlac.</b>  <b>Design bureau</b> <br>  Tolya will make a very topical report about working with foreign customers: how to find clients over the hill, how to adapt, how clients from different countries differ, and what is the pain in working with foreigners.

Then you are well aware that during the development process there are many bottlenecks that negatively affect the quality of the final product.  Layouts on the way lose the brilliant ideas of designers.  Designers do not think about the final content and forget about a bunch of small nuances.  The result is an oblique project that looks poor.  The customer roars, hugging his knees, and is not happy with the result.  All quarreled and fought.  Art director smacks of designers, and they say that designers are to blame.  What to do with it, and who to punish? <br><br>  Veronika and Pavel will tell you, because of what the client may not get the promise, discuss the ideal process of working on the web product, consider the problems in transferring the design to the layout and show how to solve them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d1e/625/b06/d1e625b0652c01a5aed7163afae81a74.jpg" width="100" height="100" title="shtang.jpg" alt="shtang.jpg" align="left">  <b>Text Algorithm</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Igor Shtang, author of the course "Typography and layout"</b> <br>  Igor will present his text layout algorithm to the audience and explain why the text is the starting point and source of ideas for design.
