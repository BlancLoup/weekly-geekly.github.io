      Recently, I did listen to the recommendation of one comrade and decided to try Spotify for myself.  Of course, the first problem was for me to register on the site, access to which is limited to a number of countries and Ukraine, of course, is not included in their list.  The best option is to use the appropriate proxy / anonymizing sites.  But I was limited to what I could afford only on my home computer.  Unfortunately, recently I was loaded enough and could not allocate enough time for this, so I decided to do everything in the workplace.  Difficulties arose in the process, because at work the Internet is already working through a proxy server and I could not change the external ip (which we have one for all computers) on the local machine.  The exit accidentally came to mind when I was holding the phone.  I am the proud owner of Blackberry with a connected BIS service.  Given the specifics of its work, all traffic is sent to servers in England, and from there to the network.  Thus, I was able to register an English account.  English account is less convenient than American, but more on that later. <br><br>  When I was a little unloaded and was already more free at home, I was able to enjoy music for two weeks through Spotify.  I will not describe the benefits of this particular service - there is a lot of information on the Internet.  But for me personally, it is quite suitable.  You may ask why exactly two weeks.  The fact is that the use of this service abroad (and I, after all, ‚Äúon the territory‚Äù of the WB was registered, if you believe the ip) is only possible for two weeks, if you are on your Free account and unlimited time if on Unlimited and Premium. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d0c/2fe/fe9/d0c2fefe915fb2aa88ccecd46ee3ed7a.jpg"><br><br>  This was for me the first reason to think about a premium account.  <u>Other</u> advantages include: high quality music (up to 320kbps), lack of advertising (some say that it is not so annoying, but for some reason it strained me), the ability to listen to tracks offline (namely, to synchronize favorite playlists with their devices and listening to music while traveling), the ability to use on a mobile (completely useless thing - BB supports the service, but in GSM networks (with GPRS connection speed) is not relevant, but via Wi-Fi there is no sense, since at home you can also have 5.1 acoustics, but outside i am always with love  my iPod). <br><br>  Returning to my thoughts about buying premium, I first decided to clarify how you can get around the 14-day limit for using abroad, and the answer was extremely simple - just log in under English ip and voila - the service thinks that I, a traveling frog, successfully came back home.  Now, even under Ukrainian ip, I started a report from scratch.  It seems that the problem is solved, but annoying advertising and the desire to listen to music in the highest possible quality did contribute to the final decision about buying a premium. <br><br>  <b>And now the fun part.</b> <br><br>  I thought everything would be simple - just like with LastFM.  That is, LastFM-PayPal-profit.  But it was not there ... Sly snobs, the British introduced a restriction on the territorial binding of payment systems. <br><br>  Briefly about all attempts: <br>  1) it was not possible to buy through PayPal due to the fact that the account itself was tied to the country of Ukraine (at first I didn‚Äôt quite understand what it was fraught with) and no matter which cards would be tied to it (I‚Äôll describe how I tried to circumvent the restriction); <br>  2) directly from plastic cards (Visa / MasterCard) did not work (having two Gold cards in place did not change the situation), since the Billing Address was of course Ukrainian; <br>  3) I could not buy an E-Card for the above reasons. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0fb/7ce/fd9/0fb7cefd960cc04091746729e068df54.jpg"><br><br>  After reading a lot of information on the Internet about all possible options how <u><b>to get the desired Premium</b></u> , I came to the following conclusions: <br>  - find a person in the UK / USA who could pay for the service (I need to give access to my Facebook account profile in order to log in to Spotify) or buy an E-Card; <br>  - get a British PayPal account (via a British ip and to a British address), link a card (where can I get it?) And buy a Premium; <br>  - get a payment card WB and directly with it and make a purchase. <br><br>  I discarded the first option right away - I have friends, but there was no desire to trust a profile in FB.  And buying a gift certificate was possible only as a one-time operation, since I didn‚Äôt want to strain someone every month with my requests. <br><br>  The second option was more difficult, since I am not a resident of the WB or even live in the territory, so that I could confirm my location to PayPal in case of anything.  I also understood that there will be a problem with the binding of cards for a reason: they have already appeared in a different account, it will be necessary to untie each time and bind to a new one;  they are all issued by Ukrainian banks.  If the decoupling from the account is quite possible (with repeated verification and blocking of amounts), then the problem of the billing address completely worried me.  In theory, the cards should ‚Äúplease‚Äù, but did not want the stick to even double-check any information on a British account. <br><br>  The third option was the most difficult.  It was not possible to obtain a real card of the issuing bank from the WB.  Information on the Internet about how remotely you can get it, I did not find, and I did not have to go there to arrange it (and Spotify itself is not worth it). <br><br>  As a result, I stopped at the second version, but I reflected on its variations, namely: there is enough information on the Internet, how to register a stick in another country, for this you must (!) Have the ip of the corresponding country (so as not to suspect them in frode), have the address of this country, and preferably (but personally for myself, I noted this item as mandatory) the card of the issuing bank of this country.  I also decided to find out which country is better (read: where it is easier to get all the necessary missing elements of my miraculous schemes): the USA or the United Kingdom. <br><br>  In the end, I did something like a comparative table for the components and this is what I did: <br><br>  - <b>ip</b> (found a service that allows you to get UK or USA ip. <a href="http://www.tunnelbear.com/">TunnelBear</a> - the simplest program with user interface. Pros - simple, works. Minuses - traffic limit of 500 MB / month. But in order to register / pay - enough with your head. By the way, suitable for registration in Spotify and PayPal); <br><br>  - <b>address</b> (to register with PayPal of the relevant country, you must enter the relevant information. For this, I used services that offer assistance in delivering goods from the US and WB. For the USA, this is <a href="https://shopfans.ru/">Shopfans</a> , <a href="https://qwintry.com/">Banderolka</a> (by the way, Banderolka offers registration in the tax-free state of Oregon, so having their account too, will not be superfluous and can be useful in the future) to the World Bank -. <a href="https://alfaparcel-support.com/">AlfaParsel</a> (was not quite convenient, since in order to obtain information about the address, it is necessary to prepay the virtual box, which I certainly did not plan de  amb) and <a href="http://britshop.ru/">Britshop.ru</a> . That's me and it was useful!) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7e0/e54/7b3/7e0e547b32884ffbf19d947c1b4a2b99.jpg"><br><br>  - <b>payment card</b> with the possibility of making payments via the Internet. <br>  Here, too, it is desirable to divide into two types: <b>physical cards</b> (real, which can be held in hands, used in everyday life, including at ATMs) and <b>virtual cards</b> (there may be problems with the identification of the issuing bank). <br>  1) Services for receiving <u><b>physical cards</b></u> - <a href="http://epayservices.com/epscard">ePayService MasterCard</a> (Pros - physical card, US issuing bank, Webmoney <a href="http://epayservices.com/epscard">deposit</a> / withdrawal option, free deposit (most likely if you directly debit your bank payment card). Minuses - monthly subscription of an active card 6 USD (72 USD per year)), <a href="https://www.payoneer.com/">Payoneer</a> (there is a lot of information about this service on Habr√©. I registered via Odesk. The advantages are a physical card, a US issuing bank, relatively inexpensive card maintenance (activation $ 9.95 + $ 3 monthly maintenance  with 0-2 operations / month or $ 1 with 2+ operations / month. Total - ~ $ 22- $ 46 / year. Activation of a replacement card for Ukraine is almost $ 13. Minuses - a small commission for replenishing the card (although this is a formal minus, since the commission is very small - $ 20 is about $ 0.78). <br>  2) Services for receiving <b><u>virtual cards</u></b> .  There are a lot of them.  There are even in the territory of the CIS countries.  You can <a href="">highlight Yandex Virtual Map</a> , <a href="http://qiwi.ru/private/cards/qvv/">QIWI Virtual Visa</a> .  Plus - a regular Visa / MasterCard card, ready for work on the Internet.  Minus - the issuing bank - Russian.  For our case is not suitable. <br><br>  I started searching for similar services abroad and quickly found the <a href="http://entropay.com/">EntroPay</a> site.  I will focus on it in more detail.  This is a service offering virtual payment cards, ready for work including with PayPal.  Replenished through ordinary payment cards by debiting the account.  The minimum replenishment is $ 20, the commission is $ 0.99.  To verify your account and bind the card to the stick, you need about 2-4 banking days.  During this day, the transaction for blocking funds will appear in the list of card transactions and you can enter a 4-digit verification code.  The card belongs to the British issuing bank.  That is, all we needed was. <br><br>  Summarizing all the above, I can derive the simplest algorithm for obtaining a premium account in Spotify: <br>  1. register with Spotify using TunnelBear to change ip to English; <br>  2. register with British PayPal using TunnelBear to change ip to English; <br>  3. registration in EntroPay (no matter what ip). <br><br>  In the process, I made one mistake - when I registered an English PayPal account, I forgot to change the ip to Ukrainian and entered EntroPay.  The profile was immediately blocked with a request to confirm my location in the WB.  By a brief letter to HelpDesk that it was some kind of mistake, it turned out to unblock the account, but for myself I concluded that ip registration and login should correspond to avoid such cases.  This also applies to PayPal.  If there are several accounts, it is advisable to use different browsers or regularly clean cookies. <br><br>  During the search for a solution, I received: <br>  2 US addresses in your name, one English, two accounts in PayPal, two virtual payment cards in EntroPay, one for each account (Ukrainian and English) and a Payoneer card will come soon. <br>  In EntroPay, I have not changed my account for different PayPal accounts.  Despite the fact that one of the virtual cards is attached to the Ukrainian stick, the creation of another solved the whole question. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5e7/d01/907/5e7d01907422e5a3edfc24a0d4797f47.jpg"><br><br>  I hope this little tangled manual will help someone. <br>  If anything, ready to help with advice. <br><br>  <i>PS: Regarding the difference between the WB and the US account Spotify - it is banal: ¬£ 9.99 vs $ 9.99.</i>  <i>In the near future, I plan to try to change the country through a request to the Spotifay support service in order to change the country to the USA.</i>  <i>I want to try to make a payment through a regular card (as I already wrote above - soon I will receive a card from Payoneer).</i>  <i>If it does not work out, then, most likely, I will remove the English stick and register it in the USA.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>PPS: I also didn‚Äôt describe the PyaPal verification process at all.</i>  <i>About this much information is provided on the net.</i> <br><br>  <b>update: I</b> found this service.  I think that will solve a lot of problems.  <a href="http://www.usunlocked.com/">US Unlocked</a> This is a virtual map with <u>US billing address</u> .  But as far as I understand, these are Discover maps.  <a href="http://www.u-g-h.com/2009/03/30/shopping-from-the-us-with-usunlocked/">Proof</a> <br><br>  <i><b>In the second part (which I plan to write in the near future) there will be another working scheme for obtaining a premium Spotify account for $ 9.99 instead of ¬£ 9.99.</b></i> <i><br></i> <habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/150352/">https://habr.com/ru/post/150352/</a></p>
