Let's, without further ado, according to good Friday habraraditsii, just look at the best programs created in the framework of the competition.  To be honest, there is something to see and be impressed with.  Another little step taken in tomorrow.  We will testify to success and let us move on - to new achievements and a new competition, which will certainly take place. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Recall, to begin with, that there were 2 tracks in the competition: Ambassador and Pioneer.  Permanent members of the community who participated in the last contest were invited to the Ambassador track;  Pioneer track was open to all.  Applications were divided into 5 categories: <br><ul><li>  Gaming and Play (Entertainment and Games) </li><li>  Immersive Collaboration / Creation (Multidirectional Interaction) </li><li>  Learning and Edutainment (Education and learning through entertainment) </li><li>  Interact Naturally (Natural Interaction) </li><li>  Open Innovation </li></ul><br>  Well, now directly the parade of the winners in the overall standings and by category. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Grand Prix in the Ambassador track (and the winner of the competition) - Seed</font> </h2><br>  <b>Alexandre Ribeiro da Silva, Brazil</b>

Managed seeds, of course, with the help of gestures. <br><br>  The toy is obviously designed for the smallest, its script is simple and uncomplicated.  However, her example shows where to go in order to make truly exciting games with interesting gameplay.  And the graphics - yes, the graphics are up to par.  Still worked professionals. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Grand Prix on the Pioneer - Orthosense track</font> </h2><br>  <b>David Schnare, Canada</b> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/d694XSOU4lA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhix-txMFT2KztLvpGCmnICH7u4tHQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <i>Application Category - Open Innovation.</i> <br><br>  Medical application that allows you to track the movements of the hand and fingers of a person to identify real and potential problems with bones and joints. <br><br>  Watch the demo is a bit boring, this topic is generally without the joke of humor, but behind it lies the abyss of meaning.  Before you is completely real, without imitation, an application that uses RealSense for health needs.  And, if we talk about the "software of the future", then it will look something like this.  By the way, pay attention to how carefully the interface is thought out and rendered. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">First prize in the Ambassador - Virtual 3D Video Maker track</font> </h2><br>  <b>Lee Bamber, United Kingdom</b> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dw6hfoRW5Fc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhNp8LqH6Y2LxrBbVIoE0Ex0l3S2A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <i>Application Category - Collaboration / Creation</i> <br><br>  A video editor that uses a video stream coming from a RealSense camera to generate a 3D image of a face and allows you to perform the simplest actions with this image.  The control is carried out by voice. <br><br>  It seems to me that this application is most interesting not as an editor with some functionality, but as a set of ideas for use in other applications.  The ideas are really interesting, if you intend to use RealSense in the future - I strongly advise you to study.  The developer can not refuse the acting qualities - this, I think, also played a role in the evaluation of the project. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">First prize in the Pioneer track - Mystery of Mansion Ravenous</font> </h2><br>  <b>Cyrus Lum, USA</b> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/NCLMnsRRR4M%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhj3CQk1h8AnHYhRitSvj5THUb_5ZA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <i>Application Category - Gaming and Play.</i> <br><br>  Playing in the genre of Hidden objects ("I'm looking for").  You have just died and become a ghost locked in a house with many rooms.  You need to find a way out of the house, sequentially opening the doors of the rooms and taking away the things that are in them. <br><br>  The game is interesting primarily because all the control in it is carried out by the movements of the head.  If you think that this is impossible - see the demo, I also did not immediately believe.  Everything looks beautiful and interesting.  To be honest, this application, in my opinion, is much more like a real toy than the winner. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Second prize in the Ambassador - Draco X / Dimension Fighter track</font> </h2><br>  <b>Yunfan Lin, China</b> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/JgOuho2e5hQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjgy24_RlOOKCpOGqm9i9Hqj3idKw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <i>Application Category - Open Innovation.</i> <br><br>  A toy-fighter in which the robot is controlled using RealSense technology, and the robot can be both virtual and real. <br><br>  First of all, it attracts the gorgeous quality of the demo video - I hope in reality everything is just as cool as in the video.  Well, hardware development in the RealSense competition is rarely seen, the time required to create them is decent, and deadlines are tight.  The real ‚Äúiron‚Äù robot looks quite workable, and managing it is not without originality.  True, before the stated multiplayer there is, in my opinion, a lot of work. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Second prize in the Pioneer track - Emma</font> </h2><br>  <b>Vladimir Shimanskiy, Ukraine</b> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/6cGrhN9WqDU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgxZe7xH6fjdbz1BxPJ0mBc4VSFjQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <i>Application Category - Collaboration / Creation.</i> <br><br>  Video chat in which RealSense is used to determine the emotions of the interlocutors and their gestures, which are visualized with the help of graphic images: a smile in the form of the sun, sadness in the form of a cloud, etc.  In the same way there is a reaction to certain words. <br><br>  An example of the use of technology RealSense "head on."  However, instead of blaming the developers for lack of imagination, I would personally thank them: they did a lot of rough work, the fruits of which others can use.  In principle, now RealSense support can be embedded in every video messenger.  What is a simple, but really working tool worse than an ornate idea? <br><br>  You can continue watching the winners' videos on <a href="https://software.intel.com/sites/campaigns/realsense-winners/">the contest page</a> .  We strongly recommend stocking up with inspiration and good ideas, for whatever not very funny reason: this year there were no developers from Russia among the winners of the Intel RealSense App Challenge.  This, in our opinion, is not at all correct.  Let's fix the situation! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/258999/">https://habr.com/ru/post/258999/</a></p>
