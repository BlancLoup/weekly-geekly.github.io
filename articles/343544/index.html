The fact of the matter is that my weight is transcendental and, of course, I want to seriously lose it. <br><br>  Previously, there was the experience of getting rid of 20 kg, but then, due to lack of motivation, a lot came back.  This time, for motivation to be serious, I challenged another person and got down to business. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Somehow reading Tim Ferris's book ‚ÄúThe Body in 4 Hours‚Äù I found an interesting recommendation - to make a table with a schedule so that the progress of weight change can be seen. <br><br>  I found this table and quickly made it along with the schedule in Google Docs:

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wx/b3/6j/wxb36j8cae1m13r8wxqeikfhxgg.png"><br><br>  The data is true. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3a/uf/4i/3auf4isqze4pwar6ws1chxy7dmi.png"><br><br>  While making the graph, I suddenly asked myself the question: why not try to apply a cohort analysis here? <br><br>  You have probably already seen the tables and graphs of cohort analysis.  They are triangles and a bunch of lines that are difficult for an unprepared person to understand. <br><br>  There is even an opinion that cohort analysis is too complicated and in reality it is useless. <br><br>  While communicating with my work colleague, I even heard the following phrase from him: the cohort analysis is applicable <b>ONLY</b> when you have a lot of objects.  If you measure one object, then the cohort analysis is not applicable at all. <br><br>  Such a thing could not get away with him :-) and I decided to do a cohort analysis for my case: for me, one person, who measures his own weight during the competition. <br><br><h2>  Select the cohorts </h2><br>  Cohorts are arbitrary objects that have a birth date. <br><br>  Actually, cohorts can be both users and anything else.  The main thing is that we know when it was born. <br><br>  In my case, the weight was the object, since  He clearly had a birth date - the date of measurement / reading. <br><br>  A cohort groups objects by some attribute.  In my case, as a cohort, a grouping of measurements was performed by week: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oo/j9/xc/ooj9xcsjaien6bhrvk2ihilzquq.png"><br><br>  Week is considered a function = ISOWEEKNUM (measurement date) <br><br>  Having dealt with the cohorts, the next step is to understand and what, in fact, to analyze with the help of them. <br><br><h2>  What to analyze using the cohort </h2><br>  I have been looking for an analogy for using the cohorts for a long time. <br><br>  At one time, many attempts were made to explain the essence of the cohorts, but most of them did not end very successfully, because  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/339982/">the cohorts themselves are rather artificial and it is difficult to imagine them in my head</a> . <br><br>  I think one of the best analogies for cohorts is seasonality. <br><br>  For example, seasonality of a business is when goods are sold better or worse at certain points (seasons). <br><br>  Seasonality is determined by comparing periods (usually years) between each other. <br><br>  We all know that the New Year in our country accounts for the peak of sales.  This is a seasonal peak. <br><br>  You also will not be difficult to submit an annual schedule of seasonality of sales, right?  Cohorts are similar.  To use them for the analysis of seasonality is the thing. <br><br>  Naturally, everywhere has its own characteristics.  Cohorts for users will work a little differently than for my weight case.  But the essence does not change.  In other words, the <b>cohort analysis shows the behavior of objects</b> . <br><br>  So, the behavior of what can be analyzed in case my weight is measured? <br><br>  Well, for example, the behavior of myself.  Since  the cohorts are broken down by weeks, the cohort analysis will show how I behave during the week. <br><br>  Leading = how I lose weight in a week. <br><br>  To do this, add to the table the column ‚Äúdelta‚Äù (weight change compared to the previous day) and ‚Äúday number of the week‚Äù (from 1 to 7): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mk/te/co/mktecozy9hz4dvh-agatzl_74_y.png"><br><br>  Weekday number = WEEKDAY (measurement date; 2) <br><br><h2>  We conduct cohort analysis </h2><br>  A cohort analysis is easily performed using Pivot Tables.  They are both in Excel and Google Docs (select the necessary columns, then Data / Pivot Table ..). <br><br>  Here is what we get: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qw/gr/u5/qwgru5ng5316zxnim-ogfngk2va.png"><br><br>  Columns - numbers of the days of the week.  Lines - cohorts (week numbers). <br><br>  ‚ÄúTotal Right‚Äù shows the average weight change by week.  ‚ÄúTotal Bottom‚Äù shows the average delta by days of the week. <br><br>  Each line shows how my weight has changed by weeks and allows you to compare the weeks with each other. <br><br>  Now, using this table we build a graph: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/82/3f/sm/823fsmcg6bcejn7lnf2tvo-cec4.png"><br><br>  The bold green line shows ‚ÄúTotal Bottom‚Äù - the average delta by day.  The remaining colored lines are the values ‚Äã‚Äãof each cohort (weeks). <br><br>  In fact, this graph is a typical example of a seasonality graph, only instead of years, weeks are compared with each other. <br><br>  The green line shows my typical behavior in the week - on which days I usually lose weight and which ones I gain. <br><br>  It is evident that on weekends, I specifically otzhirayus.  And indeed it is.  Saturday is my fasting day.  On Sunday, I actively dump the gained weight, but I obviously do not do it actively enough. <br><br>  My task is to make the graph as even as possible so that it becomes a horizontal line in the negative area.  This will mean that I do not break the rules and I am fine with losing weight. <br><br>  You can change the type of graph and present it in a slightly different form: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/um/zq/-m/umzq-mhn8gax_xflx-hobv2qilk.png"><br><br>  The green columns are the same as the green line in the previous graph.  It just seems to me that you can see it better. <br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  Actually, I wanted to see my behavior in the week - I saw him.  And I realized that when and how I need to change. <br><br>  This is how I applied the cohort analysis for my competition.  I‚Äôm waiting, I‚Äôm not waiting when I fill in the table with even more data and make my green line even. <br><br>  In fact, cohort analysis is not a substitute for slice or average graphs that we are used to.  This is just another look at the same object. <br><br>  A cohort is a look at the typical behavior (seasonality) of the analyzed object. <br><br>  As you can see, in the cohorts, in fact, there is nothing difficult and they can be quite independently calculated and analyzed in Excel and even Google Docs. <br><br>  You can <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11t5XivqgHJhaeiO8TWvSo2m9__9aEiKSrKOBCE_NRJQ/edit%3Fusp%3Dsharing">see for</a> yourself <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11t5XivqgHJhaeiO8TWvSo2m9__9aEiKSrKOBCE_NRJQ/edit%3Fusp%3Dsharing">the table I made in GDocs</a> . <br><br>  If the article has benefited you, I will be grateful for the like and repost. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/343544/">https://habr.com/ru/post/343544/</a></p>
