  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A small review of Zend Studio Neon Beta</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Yesterday, the Beta version, in my opinion, was one of the most functional and popular PHP code editors. <br>  Let's try to figure out what this monster is, because  call it the code editor language does not rotate, the size of 350Mb can be useful. <br><br>  The first thing I noticed is the speed of work.  Compared to the installed Zend 5.5, the increase is felt with the naked eye and approaches native Win applications.  Still, Eclipse as a basic platform for developing commercial code editors is becoming increasingly popular.  Last year we were presented with Flex Builder, this one - Zend Studio. <br><br>  We now turn to the functional. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  From immediately noticed actively used things: <br>  SVN support.  In Zend Studio 5.5, there was a bug that caused the editor to slow down when configured to work with SVN.  Here, this is not observed and SVN support is implemented in two forms: a separate perspective (‚ÄúSVN Repository Exploring‚Äù) and in PHP Explorer-e itself (speaking Russian in the file list), the latter being very convenient. <br>  Do you want to use SVN / CSV?  Local history will save the father of Russian democracy.  A very handy thing - shows all changes to the file in the project for the last week, or a year, if you tweak the settings. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Full PHPDoc support.  Moreover, the use of the studio itself actively pushes to the use thereof.  For example, if you specify <br><blockquote>  ... <br>  / ** <br>  * Description of the function <br>  * <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/return/" class="user_link">return</a> MyClass <br>  * / <br>  function getMyClass () </blockquote><br>  then codeHinting will know that our function returns an instance of MyClass. <br><br>  CodeHinting itself is implemented quite well and all found classes / functions in the project are automatically connected.  Plus are also codeTemplates, in which adding your templates is easy.  And with proper setup can help save a lot of working time. <br><br>  In Zend Studio, I really missed the FIXME and TODO tags that appear on the special Tasks tab, collected from the entire project.  Those.  if it is necessary to put a note that something needs to be done or to fix it is enough to leave a comment like <blockquote>  // fixme here you need to fix something </blockquote>  and you will not forget about it.  He himself found a dozen and a half of such notes after importing his project :) <br><br>  Debagger :) One of the most important things for the sake of which is just to put a zend.  Many people still debug with old-fashioned methods using var_dump.  In my opinion, this is like pumping a tire with a bicycle pump.  While it is small and from the bike - everything is fine.  But when this all grows into a huge tractor project - God forbid. <br>  Profiler  Next to the Run and Debug buttons was added the 3rd: Profile, after use of which you will be clearly told where the CPU time was spent during the execution of the script.  You just have to sit and optimize. <br><br>  Code analyzer  Here you need to modify the file.  First of all, he found me a bunch of invalid HTML and XML.  The first didn't bother me, I already knew about invalid XML.  Therefore, I disabled the automatic validation of these things.  The second point: Zend Studio does not know anything about what Pear is installed on your machine.  Therefore, the latter is connected via the ‚ÄúInclude paths‚Äù of the project.  Plus, when validating in 90% of cases, it highlights the wrong line in the code.  But the tab on the Problems line is correct, so keep the course on it.  By the way, finding and correcting about 300 varnings in your project - actually found a few bugs.  So I recommend that the Problems tab be empty for you, which will help to correct errors in the future.  Even in spite of the fact that it is necessary to put stubs of a type <br><blockquote>  catch (Exception $ e) <br>  { <br>  $ e-&gt; getMessage (); <br>  ... <br>  } <br></blockquote><br>  Because  if the $ e variable itself is not processed by you, Warning-a ‚ÄúVariable $ e appears only once‚Äù cannot be avoided. <br><br>  Refactoring.  Em.  After what I saw in IDEA, it‚Äôs not called refactoring.  We were given the opportunity to rename classes / functions / variables and move files.  And the studio will help us then correct the sources that refer to the selected object.  In 50% of cases does not work.  In general, questionable purchase. <br><br>  Unit tests.  I can't say anything intelligible here - I myself use SimpleTest, against the included PHPUnit.  But just snap it was pleasantly surprised by the simplicity of the creation of the test case. <br><br>  Of the minuses, I also want to note the absence of word wrapa.  Lovers of writing long lines - this is not gud for you. <br><br>  Considering things like Database Explorer, WYSYWIG editor, CVS and many more things in the standard set and the extensibility of the Eclipse itself - I think we have an editor # 1. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/14931/">https://habr.com/ru/post/14931/</a></p>
