      Having seen the inspirational materials, you have to learn the naked truth about startaparstvom. <br><br>  <b>1) Nobody needs you.</b>  This is the first bitter truth that everyone who discovers his startup should understand.  Neither Internet users, your potential prospective clients, nor government programs that are ‚Äúblowing‚Äù help to young entrepreneurs, nor the entire banking system that offers attractive start-up credits, you simply don‚Äôt need.  Let's start the "debriefing" from the end. <br><br>  To begin with, it should be noted that taking a loan in a bank, right after you had an idea or a prototype was created, the idea is rather stupid.  Money, even large enough (although who will give you their word of honor?) Run out so quickly that you do not have time to look back.  And the debt will remain.  And you have to give it.  Whether you like it or not.  Therefore, wait at least until you begin to make a profit that will not only pay off the loan, but also provide you with everything you need to exist.  Moreover, study all the banking offers for small businesses in the market, as it is sometimes more profitable to take an ordinary loan. <br><br>  Next are government programs and business support organizations.  Having visited several such organizations and their events, I came to the conclusion that they can give nothing but information, by and large.  Yes, and the information they take from the Internet.  Therefore, it is better to read popular sites about startups and young entrepreneurs.  Most of the articles, especially the articles on growth hacks, were written based on the experience of other people.  They are quite relevant and can give you ideas on how to develop your startup. <br><br>  And finally, your potential customers.  First, to convey to them the very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãyour innovative product and to win their trust will be very, very difficult.  Secondly, to make them pay money for your product will be almost not realistic in the first stages.  Thirdly, likes and repost, which you will receive in social networks, conducting advertising campaigns, will not make you a profit.  A social network user, having seen 1000 likes and 1000 reposts under the post, may just be interested in your offer and put up his 1001 like, but this does not mean that he is ready to buy your product.  Humble, huskies are not customers! <br><br>  <b>2) Time is a loose concept.</b>  When planning the creation of a project, many people, after reading smart books, begin to develop a detailed business plan and set deadlines for its implementation almost by the hour.  And so, at the very end of the work, they are absolutely sure that they will be able to realize it and ‚Äústart to get profit in 6 months‚Äù.  As if not so.  Over time, much in this regard will be refined and improved.  You will have new ideas or you will abandon old ones.  So in advance, extend the implementation period by half.  And if you do not have the skills of programming or engineering, then - 4 times. <br>  You will be happy if you can complete the creation of the project earlier and proceed to a further phase. <br><br>  <b>3) It's all about people.</b>  No matter how cloying it sounds, your team is 70% of your business success.  One person in a million will be able to create a sought-after project, working alone.  And this person is not you.  And do not expect. <br>  Without a doubt, you can start the implementation yourself, but do not stop looking for people in the team.  Look not for those who ‚Äúlick your ass‚Äù to you, praising your idea, but for those who can really help with something, as in the first case all activity will be limited to words and delay your project for an indefinite period. <br><br>  <b>4) Project cost.</b>  Well, how have you calculated how much your idea will cost you?  Well done.  Now feel free to add 20% - 30% of the costs.  There will be unforeseen expenses throughout your business journey.  Moreover, soon you will come across services that will require regular monthly expenses that you did not take into account.  The money will be spent a lot, but when you can monetize the project is not known. <br><br>  <b>5) Pre-design stage.</b>  An incredible number of people have already ‚Äúbumped up‚Äù with their start-ups and are now writing articles and recommendations that the idea should be tested before starting something serious. <br>  First of all, you need to answer the most tricky question: is your project just cool or is there really a problem that it solves.  Many people do what they think is interesting, funny or ‚Äúfor fun‚Äù.  Of course, there is some probability that he will ‚Äúshoot this‚Äù, but what are the chances? <br><br>  Open your blog, conduct a survey, create a page in the social network or landing page to get the first reviews and customers.  Communicate, ask, find out.  At the same time try to spend as little money as possible on all this.  Soon they will be useful to you. <br>  It would also do well to learn about competitors: are they there and how are they promoting their products.  Not found in Russia?  Look at foreign sites where startups gather.  With a probability of 90%, I can say that such an idea already exists and, perhaps, it has recently received major investments.  And this means that other entrepreneurs in Russia have begun the creation of similar projects, and you have less and less time to implement yours.  Do not be fooled.  As a result, spend money, time and nerves. <br><br>  <b>6) Work on the project.</b>  Despite all the "pitfalls" of entrepreneurship, you decided to start creating your own business and seriously started developing it.  After some time, one way or another, the ideas are exhausted, and you do not know what to do next.  You fall into a stupor and slowly throw development. <br><br>  To prevent this from happening, start in parallel the creation of another small project, less significant, but interesting for you.  It is difficult to explain, but by switching between two projects, you will give your brain a break from excessive concentration on one project.  Being engaged in one, you will have ideas for another, and vice versa. <br><br>  <b>7) Investors and funds.</b>  Favorite topic of all entrepreneurs.  ‚ÄúWe will make a project, we will receive investments, we will chic!‚Äù - this is what most new businessmen think.  No matter how!  You will not get anything! <br>  Think for yourself: how many start-up financing offers do they receive every day?  The chance that you will be noticed is extremely small.  And in the initial stages it is simply not there.  You can disagree, saying that there are investors who invest in startups in the early stages.  I will answer you: you will not suit them.  Stupid people are not sitting there either, who value many factors before investing their personal savings.  They look at how ‚Äústar‚Äù you have a team, where they worked before and what their experience is, do you still have a successful business, how big is the market, who are the competitors and much more. <br>  You can write to them, start a business relationship and talk about the company's achievements, but until you have an income, the chances of getting investments are almost nil.  Do not think that the "uncle" will come and make you ash.  Work! <br><br>  Do not be naive and do not start your own business without weighing all the pros and cons.  You will spend more money and time than you think.  And after everything that you go through, there are no guarantees that your business will pay off or be profitable. <br><br>  On the other hand, never listen to someone who discourages you from starting a business.  Read articles and success stories, look for ways to implement your idea, even in small steps, but move forward.  In the end, you'll only be glad you did what you wanted. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296196/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296196/</a></p>
