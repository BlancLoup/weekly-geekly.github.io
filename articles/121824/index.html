Success story</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>Despite the fact that more than a week has passed since the release of iOS 5 Beta 1, the article will be useful to those who would like to install iOS 5, but not quite up to date on the details of installing beta versions of firmware on iDevice.</i> <br><br>  Since the advent of links for downloading iOS 5 on the Internet, I had the obsession to install it on my personal iPod Touch, just for fun and pokalat for.  It was stopped by the lack of a developer account, and, as a result, unpleasant problems with the activation of the stitched device. <br><br>  In addition, the unguaranteed opportunity to roll back to the native for the device, the last stable 4.3.3 ( <i>update: as it turned out later, direct hands increase the chance to 100%</i> ) and numerous posts on the iGuides forums from the series ‚Äúadd my UDID, I fucked up and I have a brick Well, backward "enthusiasm restrained.  However, having remembered that I was afraid of bricks even at the time of the Motorola re-flashing on the P2K platform, it was decided that we would sew. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  The required minimum for iOS 5 firmware. </h4><br><ul><li>  iTunes 10.5 Beta (Google Help, free download without SMS and registration) </li><li>  IOS 5 firmware file for your device.  (Google to help. It is better to use <a href="http://rutracker.org/forum/viewtopic.php%3Ft%3D3606246">torrents</a> in order not to download the 700-meter file from buggy file sharing) </li><li>  iOS 5-compatible device.  These are: iPhone 3GS / 4, iPod Touch 3G / 4G, iPad / iPad 2. </li></ul><br>  <b>Attention!</b>  I had numerous and inexplicable problems with the firmware on PowerPC, Leopard 10.5.8.  It did not happen, it was not synchronized, it swore almost with obscenities, once even wrote that I had an iPhone connected in restore mode.  Unfortunately, I did not learn to call the iPod after that.  This is what I mean: if there are problems on PowerPC, find an Intel machine - on MSI Wind U100 from 10.6.7 everything started right the first time.

      And yet, the most interesting stage of installing iOS 5 beta is ... <br><br><h4>  Activation </h4><br>  As many already know, in order to use the beta version of the firmware, the device must be activated on Apple servers, for which its unique identifier (UDID) must be associated with the iOS Developer Account.  Otherwise we will not get further setup screen'a.  Here we have three options to choose from: <br><ul><li>  <b>First, official.</b>  Buy an iOS Developer Account <i>($ 100 per year on the Mastercard card)</i> , or find <i>someone</i> familiar with such an account <i>(a good person is priceless)</i> that will tie your device to it.  Apple allows you to bind up to 100 unique UDID for one account, and, usually, to find such a person is not a problem </li><li>  <b>The second is DIY.</b>  With a dirty hack through VoiceOver, we skip the activation and get to Springboard.  Side effects - not synchronized with iTunes and iCloud, the GSM module does not work on the iPhone.  We need it? </li><li>  <b>Third, cunning.</b>  <s>Stay on 4.3.3 and wait for the fall and final release of the 5-ki.</s> Buy the addition of one UDID to someone else's dev-account.  Smart comrades have long understood that with the release of the beta from the iOS Developer Account, you can extract a good profit by selling one by one the attachment of foreign UDIDs to it.  The cost of the service is $ 2-10 per device.  The speed of adding - from 15 minutes to days. </li></ul><br>  The first option was dropped immediately - there were no acquaintances with the dev-account, the second did not allow full use of the device, and since the goal was to install iOS 5 for everyday use, option 3 was chosen.  You can buy a device binding to a developer‚Äôs account on thematic forums, specialized one-day websites, or on the world's main flea market - ebay.  The latter provides at least some reliability of the transaction, and gives a ghostly, but still guarantees that we will not be thrown. <br><br><h4>  Go to ebay </h4><br>  Everything is simple: <br><ol><li>  Go to <a href="http://ebay.com/">Ebay.com</a> </li><li>  We are looking for lots containing <b>UDID</b> in the title </li><li>  ????? </li><li>  PROFIT !!!  (iOS 5) </li></ol>  Let us examine in more detail paragraph 3. Sorting the search results by price, you need to select an adequate seller.  We look at the rating, read feedbacks.  From the remaining 3 lots, choose the one where they promise the most rapid registration of UUIDs.  I stopped at the lot ‚ÄúINSTANT iOS 5 beta UDID registration (LESS THE 15 MINS)‚Äù (sic). <br><br>  The purchase process is as follows: at the payment confirmation stage in PayPal, you can leave a message for the seller ( <i>Add message</i> link under Order Details).  In it we write: "% yourdeviceUDID%, Thank you!".  You can view the UDID in the aytyuns by clicking on the Serial Number field in the Device Summary.  Then Edit&gt; Copy and it is in your clipboard.  After payment for the period specified in the description of the lot, I received a message from the seller with the following text: ‚ÄúDear% username%, Your UDID has been successfully added!  Thank you for your business! ‚Äù.  Now you can go to the main stage of the firmware: <br><br><h4>  Actually, firmware </h4><br>  1. Put iTunes 10.5 Beta (wow, the semaphore is horizontal again!), Connect the device, go to the Summary tab. <br>  2. Hold <i>Option</i> (Mac), or <i>Shift</i> (Win) and click Restore. <br>  3. Specify the file with the downloaded firmware and shaking hands, click Open.  The process has begun. <br><br>  In a couple of minutes we will see the very first new feature of iOS 5 - Slide to setup.  After selecting regional settings and installing a WiFi connection, the device will climb into the Internet and successfully activated.  If there is no WiFi, we connect to the aytyuns, the activation will go through it. <br><br><h4>  Jailbreak </h4><br>  In principle, it would be possible to dwell on this, but today <a href="http://twitter.com/">@musclenerd</a> widely known in narrow circles announced the release of the tied iOS 5 beta jailbreak - <a href="http://blog.iphone-dev.org/redsn0w-iOS5">RedSn0w 0.9.8b1</a> . <br>  JB works, but will almost certainly remain tied until the release of iOS 5, with all that it implies. <br><br> <a href="http://picquick.ru/image/0192f7bac09796558e665881aab2e16f"><img src="http://picquick.ru/uploads/10062011/0192f7bac09796558e665881aab2e16f.jpeg" title="picquick.ru - hosting of images and pictures" alt="picquick.ru"></a> <br><br><h4>  Is it worth bothering at all? </h4><br>  <i>- Why do you call this version of software 'beta'?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Coz it's beta than nothing.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>¬© QDB.us</i> <br><br>  The battery holds normally (maybe a little less than 4.3.3), programs and toys for the most part work as it should.  Periodically, something crashes (Settings x4, Safari x2, Fragger (such a game) x2), but this is an inevitable evil beta. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/121824/">https://habr.com/ru/post/121824/</a></p>
