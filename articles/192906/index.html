  <section class="page js-page"><h1>IFA 2013. New to Philips. Acoustics and TVs</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> This year I managed to get to the largest international exhibition IFA 2013 in Berlin.  First of all, I visited the stand of Philips, which showed a lot of interesting new products.  This is mainly acoustics for young people and cool TVs with 3D, Cloud TV, 4K and other newfangled technologies.  Was on the stand and household appliances, for example, vacuum cleaners, coffee makers, razors and other things that are useful in the economy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/406/850/6f2/4068506f263449abd6d3b1a824d60edd.jpg"><br><br>  But let's get everything in order.  Carefully, under the cut photos of gadgets and girls. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Philips held the presentation not at -1 day (like Sony and Samsung), but at 0, but this did not reduce the hype.  The company shared its ideas for the future, talked about new products, and also brought one of the most famous DJs to events.  The presentation was led by <a href="">Peter Nota</a> , CEO of Philips for LifeStyle products.

      At the very beginning it was told about concepts.  For example, a slow cooker with Wi-Fi.  You connect to it from your tablet, find the desired recipe, read what you need for cooking.  Then put the necessary products in the slow cooker, set the time on the tablet and wait.  You do not need to follow her, all information will be on the tablet.  Perhaps, there‚Äôs just a camera missing, which will show you how the food is prepared, and you will like it and upload it on Youtube. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/670/6ac/873/6706ac8738e56a626026688472053ba8.jpg"><br><br>  Philips also told about the new Wi-Fi coffee makers that can brew you coffee.  In general, Philips will now embed Wi-Fi in all of its household appliances, and in addition to Bluetooth, NFC will also be inserted into the acoustics.  But more on that later.  In addition to coffee makers and multicookers, Philips also has a room floor air purifier.  Also with Wi-Fi, as you understand.  Light can be adjusted, the power of the stream, in general, a handy thing for a "smart home", if anyone already has it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/4e9/8f8/09b/4e98f809b3fc51043900343672425db1.jpg"><br><br>  The most important novelty that we were shown, of course, was the new Philips 9000 TV (TP Vision divisions) with 4K resolution and other newfangled accessories. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/a53/1bd/dcc/a531bddcce1827d83d132c507a3a9e5c.jpg"><br><br>  The TV, of course, is equipped with an Ambilight - a system that creates lighting around the display in the colors of the screen picture.  This is convenient, since the perception is much softer and more pleasant for the eyes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/0a6/bb5/d28/0a6bb5d28ce1ad0cc85af84470432a00.jpg"><br><br>  In addition, in addition to the usual Smart TV, Philips TV will also feature Cloud TV.  This is a system that allows you to watch digital television.  Of course, not all the channels familiar to the Russian user will be there.  However, in private conversation representatives of the company promised in the coming months to fill the system with up to 60 channels.  Of course, all this will not be free, there will be channels by subscription, there will be advertising, but some will be free.  By the way, now Philips TVs will be connected with Dropbox and you can view photos on the big screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/1a9/aae/aee/1a9aaeaee828558ea9f7551835e1bc03.jpg"><br><br>  Philips TVs now allow you to transfer a picture from the screen to your tablet or smartphone.  This is convenient if you are watching a movie and here you urgently need to escape to the kitchen.  They pressed a couple of buttons, the film is now being broadcast to you on the iPad, and you calmly go to the kitchen to fry steaks and watch the show.  Reverse broadcast is also possible.  We were shown how to display an image from a phone on Android on a TV screen.  Moreover, you can not only watch photos and movies, but even play games, although not without brakes, of course. <br><br>  Perhaps one of the coolest new products is the M1X-DJ amateur DJ console (read as a DJ mix).  This is a remote control with two turntables, various switches and buttons.  In fact, they simply duplicate all the elements in the iPad application.  By the way, the owners of the old iPad will not be able to use this remote, it is only for the Lightning connector. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/335/23c/d4e/33523cd4e65c0c85663f7eba716825c5.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, it was created together with the famous DJ Armin Van Buuren, who introduced this novelty. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/6e0/bee/c9f/6e0beec9f67f398f5a48628db91e8265.jpg"><br><br>  The device itself is quite interesting.  Of course, the DJ panels on the bulk market.  But this is the first in my memory amateur gadget at an affordable price.  Oh yeah, it costs 16k rubles.  In general, instead of another iPhone, you can buy such a thing and have parties at home.  And if you buy 4 more batteries, then you can arrange raves and in nature. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/734/2b3/a65/7342b3a65a4c7f7248c41fb3feb20486.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/0eb/eed/b5a/0ebeedb5ae619c1709bd1fbf6f84f015.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to this DJ station, Philips has introduced many acoustic novelties.  Moreover, both desktop solutions and portable speakers.  By the way, now portable speakers have already outgrown the form factor of small barrels that play disgustingly.  Now it can even be a rather large box with speakers.  In general, see for yourself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/386/955/cae/386955cae635e99b531c96bde8c8e683.jpg"><br><br>  I found the BR-1X column interesting.  This is such a "brick" in which there are two dynamics.  It can be used at home with a laptop or computer (if you do not have professional acoustics 7.1, of course), and on the street with a smartphone.  Moreover, he has an interesting button that significantly increases the volume (quality loss can not be avoided) for the street.  In general, a kind of boombox for gatherings with friends in the yard or in nature. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/3ab/82f/36f/3ab82f36f10b0705790460e06d60e862.jpg"><br><br>  What is interesting, if your friends also have such a speaker, then you can connect them together and get an even louder and surround sound.  It is unlikely, of course, that will happen, but anything is possible.  Well and an important detail - the column is moisture-proof.  You can not be afraid to put it in the rain, although you should not swim with it, it can not withstand a deep dive.  As for NFC, almost all portable speakers now have this technology.  But do not expect the sound will still be transmitted via Bluetooth.  Why, then, need NFC?  It's simple: you bring a smartphone, you turn on Bluetooth, the speaker and smartphone ‚Äúmate‚Äù and music starts playing.  It's faster than hand-made, that's all. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/9b8/497/d40/9b8497d4055101ef0c72f60d010428a3.jpg"><br><br>  More prestigious novelties under the Fidelio brand were also presented.  Here and manual assembly, and a noble tree, in general, not for young people.  There were many interesting models.  But perhaps the most eye-catching one is this speaker with a speaker for high frequencies.  Its body is made by hand.  The sound, by the way, is very good: both the bass is felt and the tops slip. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/03c/86a/9ec/03c86a9ec3492d37a9ef9ee327aab437.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, the developers at Philips went for a ruse, so as not to lose customers with the iPhone.  In almost all accessories that have a wired connection to an iPhone or iPad, a switch is made between the old and the new connector.  I feel, soon we will see the same, but also with microUSB for Android. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/9cd/6ab/090/9cd6ab090fea98f53e560938fe887747.jpg"><br><br>  For users of desktop computers, Philips showed such large speakers with good bass.  They can also connect your phone via Bluetooth, if you really want. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/452/0ef/04d/4520ef04d13dad51f99330e667237659.jpg"><br><br>  As always, Philips introduced a lot of headphones.  There are wireless models, there are those made in collaboration with Ray Ban.  In general, there are a lot of headphones and we will not go deep into them.  Anyway, those who understand sound quality will choose professional ‚Äúears‚Äù, and those who are interested in design will buy what they like in the store. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/013/57f/4fd/01357f4fd9ee77ab0535a9b1de3956bb.jpg"><br><br>  Of the interesting innovations was also shown a system for conference calls.  This small box is placed on the table, turned on and up to 10 people can communicate with it and their phones.  You can not arrange the microphones (their role will be performed by personal smartphones), do not split a bunch of wires, but simply use just such a small thing.  It is personally difficult for me to appreciate the advantage because  never used a conference call, but I think it should be convenient. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/6ca/2b7/39e/6ca2b739e0c7b3203fc0f87666f62261.jpg"><br><br>  All these new products should be available in the European and Russian markets at the beginning of 2014.  I personally liked the DJ station and portable speakers.  As for TVs, it seems to me that the market is not yet ready for 4K resolution.  Yes, it's great, beautiful, but for FullHD we still have many channels that do not give out a signal, let alone UltraHD. <br><br>  Of course, Philips brought not only new products to IFA, but almost all of its equipment.  There were razors, and juicers, and toothbrushes, and headphones.  In general, everything is everything that the company only produces for the market. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/2f2/9ce/d97/2f29ced970829fe8f425146cf4c8698d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/1b5/211/2c2/1b52112c2053155343d024f7d5b23c00.jpg"><br><br>  It was interesting to look at the details of which assembled perhaps the most unusual TV.  If you remember, this is a screen that stands on a glass stand.  Moreover, it can be placed either at an angle to the wall, or hang, otherwise it can not be installed.  Strange, but very nice design, which creates the illusion that the screen is floating above the ground. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/1db/863/7a0/1db8637a07339e5988d82454e9a652a7.jpg"><br><br>  And of course, there are a lot of pretty girls at IFA, so here is a couple from the Philips stand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/155/2e9/8fa/1552e98fabaca725e9fa856c35dd4778.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/cd8/110/a4d/cd8110a4d251b01aef31edc3d3549b05.jpg"><br><br>  If it works, then in the next post I will tell and show all the new items at the IFA.  And there were a lot of them, believe me.  This is one of the largest tech shows in Europe. <br>  <b>Good luck!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/192906/">https://habr.com/ru/post/192906/</a></p>
