Part 2, positive</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We have already considered the negative and neutral (weak) influence ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/184408/">What brings us musical piracy</a> ) piracy.  Now it is the turn to consider the position that the exchange of music can have a positive impact. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1e0/642/108/1e06421087f18cc3a62cd4a306855615.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Advocates of the position, piracy - evil, use the fact that music sales fell in 2002‚Äì2003 (RIAA, 2011).  In the same years, the number of sites illegally exchanging music has increased dramatically (BBC News, 2010).  This fact clearly shows a strong negative correlation between falling sales and piracy.  ‚ÄúThe results showed that most of the studies carried out support the theory that the decline in sales can be fully explained through piracy.  Even those works that failed to prove full involvement in the fall are usually attributed to piracy a significant influence ‚Äù(Liebowitz, 2011, p.13).  Although the facts are on the surface, the study showed the opposite results. <br><br>  Robert Hammond (2012) in his work criticizes previous works.  He claims that Zentner (2005) and Liebowitz (2008) did not collect the necessary data regarding file-sharing services.  Therefore, as a result of using a proxy, the reliability of their work decreased, which could be expressed in a negative conclusion about the nature of pirated file sharing.

      Hammond in his study focused on albums that leaked to the network before the official release.  One of these leaks and became the reason for the proceedings on <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napster">Napster</a> .  ‚ÄúBefore the release period begins from the moment when the album became available for exchange.  Record industry representatives say that the pre-release period is very important for the sales cycle and argue that deterring pre-release piracy is a priority ‚Äù(Hammond, 2012, p.2). <br><br>  In his study, Hammond found out: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ That there is a positive link between music piracy and sales.  Albums, leaked to the network before the official release, may receive additional sales <br>  ‚Ä¢ Positive influence is manifested only for mainstream works, for niche music such a link is not traceable <br>  ‚Ä¢ Positive influence is twice as strong for teams that have sold at least 100,000 copies of their albums. <br>  ‚Ä¢ The effect is also stronger for teams that have released more than 3 albums. <br><br>  And this could be finished, because  There are very few works that saw piracy on the positive side.  This situation did not suit me, and therefore I decided to conduct my research on the topic of musical piracy, plus I had a chance. <br><br>  A little about yourself and the project.  I am 25 and now I study at Canadian University, Lakehead University, where I entered the Master's program in management last spring (the project direction was chosen by marketing). <br>  My project is called <b>‚ÄúDigital Music Piracy: The Examination of Music Downloading Influence on Customers' Purchase Intentions‚Äù</b> <br>  The project is based on the work of Pikas et al.  (2011), in which the authors tried to consider the future of the music industry, i.e.  against the background of the popularity of pirated sites, which can be a source of income.  I will not climb at all in the jungle, so I will give only 2 facts: <br>  - 78.66%, from among the respondents, download music from pirated sites <br>  - 52% of the respondents attend live concerts <br><br>  Those.  we can assume that there are people who download music, as well as attend concerts.  In principle, this idea lies at the heart of my work, that people who use pirated websites for downloading can also spend real money on music and related products.  Those.  To put it simply, as an example, torrent trackers become platforms for the promotion of performers. <br>  I have already launched a questionnaire (collected a little more than 350 responses).  Below is the distribution of answers to one of the questions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f8a/8f2/6a2/f8a8f26a270952ae64ebe9959b29ff32.png" alt="image"><br><br>  It is still too early to draw any conclusions about the nature of piracy, since  results analysis was not conducted, and data collection is not yet over.  But I have reason to believe that the result will be at least interesting. <br><br>  And lastly, I would like to turn to the habr-community for help.  Below is a <a href="http://survey.websurveycreator.com/s.aspx%3Fs%3Dc9f77872-1d17-45dc-956b-551d7838cfe3">link</a> to a short questionnaire that will take you no more than 3-5 minutes.  This will help to make small but clear the question of the nature of piracy and create a foothold for further research. <br><br> <a href="http://survey.websurveycreator.com/s.aspx%3Fs%3Dc9f77872-1d17-45dc-956b-551d7838cfe3"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/669/cf1/a23/669cf1a23ad68411015300a9e87c6105.png" alt="Click here to begin the survey" title="Click here to begin the survey"></a> <br><br>  Ps.  After writing the diploma, the results will be translated and published on Habr√© as an article. <br>  Pss.
