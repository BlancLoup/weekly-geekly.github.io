  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Kickstarter became available to Canadians</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/754/d5a/587/754d5a587bbfd0b9696f1b609c34a288.png" align="left">  Yesterday, September 9, 2013, the most famous crowdfunding site <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter</a> became <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/blog/kickstarter-in-canada-0">available to project creators from Canada</a> .  Projects from Canada will be displayed in Canadian dollars, but be on the general list with projects from the UK and the USA.  Thus, it is now possible to create projects on <b>Kickstarter</b> from three countries (you can support projects, as before, from all countries).  Since yesterday, several dozen Canadian projects have already been launched. <br><br>  The next step is the <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/australia">possibility of creating projects from Australia and New Zealand</a> in the near future, expanding the list of countries from which projects can be created to five. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  What does this tell us?  <b>Kickstarter</b> started as a site only for project creators from the United States, but over time began to add other countries, obviously realizing the potential revenue from projects in these countries.  Therefore, it cannot be excluded that sometime in the future it will be possible to create projects also from the CIS countries, Germany and Israel (those countries where the bulk of the Russian-speaking population of the planet is concentrated, except for the USA and Canada, where the creation of projects is already allowed).  So far, you can resort to the help of a friend, relative or business partner living in one of the allowed countries, and with each country added to the allowed list, it is a little easier to do.

      <br>
      Anticipating questions - why not create projects on <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/">IndieGoGo</a> (where the creation of projects from any country is allowed) instead of trying to find friends / relatives / partners for <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter</a> ?  Of course, this can be done, and even at <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/">IndieGoGo</a> there are projects that collect millions (the last example is <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/apps4all/blog/191966/">Ubuntu Edge</a> ), and many successful projects.  However, I personally don‚Äôt like <b>IndieGoGo</b> for several reasons: <br><ol><li>  IndieGoGo is much less known than Kickstarter.  The very word " <b><i>Kickstarter</i></b> " has become, in a way, a household name for any crowdfunding.  Kickstarter cover in the media much more than IndieGoGo (for example, on the same Habr√©).  If you ask a random person from the street in an English-speaking country, if he knows the name of a crowdfunding website, then he is likely to call you Kickstarter, and only a small percentage of people also know about IndieGoGo (and there is not a single person who would know about IndieGoGo and did not know about Kickstarter).  For well-known companies with a large advertising budget (such as <b>Ubuntu</b> ), this is most likely without a difference - they will be perfectly illuminated at IndieGoGo - but for ordinary people with a little-known project and a small amount of fees, this can mean the difference between ‚Äúcollecting the necessary amount‚Äù (Kickstarter), and ‚Äúnot collect and $ 100‚Äù (IndieGoGo). </li><li>  At IndieGoGo there is almost no pre-moderation of the projects launched.  This means that there can be any projects there.  For some, this is an advantage (after all, Kickstarter has a list of prohibited categories), but for me personally - a disadvantage, since my project will be difficult to find among projects like " <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/kupd-s-community-chest-for-megan">I have small breast <s>boobs</s> , give me money to increase them</a> " ( and such projects on IndieGoGo <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects%3Ffilter_title%3Dboobs%26pg_num%3D1%26search_submit%3DSearch">in bulk</a> ).  Therefore, the project exhibited at IndieGoGo is associated with the project of the ‚Äúsecond grade‚Äù (not good enough for Kickstarter), although this is not always the case. </li><li>  IndieGoGo works with <b>Paypal</b> , who <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/192914/">loves to freeze money for no reason at all</a> , so donations received are not always safe.  Kickstarter uses <b>Amazon Payments</b> for projects from the USA and direct transfer to the bank account of the project creator for other countries (in both cases, the chances of freezing are much lower). </li></ol><br>  Naturally, all of the above applies to projects designed for an international audience.  Projects designed for Russia and the CIS countries can be successfully launched on Russian crowdfunding sites such as <a href="http://planeta.ru/">Planet</a> , <a href="http://boomstarter.ru/">Boomstarter</a> , <a href="http://smipon.ru/">SMIPON</a> and others. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/193208/">https://habr.com/ru/post/193208/</a></p>
