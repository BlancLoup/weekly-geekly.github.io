  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Internet 2.0 Concepts</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h3>  Internet 2.0: Introduction </h3><br>  Internet 2.0 is an evolution of the existing Internet, its continuation, giving Internet users the opportunity to be free, responsible for their freedom, and independently manage their time.  In addition, Internet 2.0 allows you to actively protect your rights to freedom and time management, as well as respect the rights of other people.  One of such particulars can be called Copyright, etc.  etc., but!  do it yourself. <br><br><h3>  Goals and Objectives of Internet 2.0 </h3><br><ol><li>  Freedom and security of Internet users, protection of personal life and personal information from the encroachments of other persons, both by means of software and personal participation (for example, protection of their copyright in the circle of familiar persons) </li><li>  Managing your Time - independently: you follow your vital interests - other people do not violate them and you do not violate their vital interests.  Internet 2.0 provides assistance and support to you and all other people equally (using the appropriate software). </li><li>  Maximum universal technological freedom and accessibility for ordinary users: they do not need to know what is in their computer (PCI, HDD, DDR, USB, CPU, etc.);  they simply stick one contact into another and use it without having to buy a new fast computer - these technological improvements are made on supercomputers </li><li>  The most effective economic freedom and information security: you do not pay for potential opportunities, but really used, while you are the one who owns the situation, and not the company that provided the service.  At what you pay the cost of maintaining the service from your own pocket and the company is obliged to you and other people to transparently report on the conduct of their business and the service provided.  You have the right, by means of a vote, to determine the actions of this company according to your own needs and the needs of other people for the common good, and not in the selfish interests of these companies. </li><li>  The creation of direct relationships between the author of the service and consumers, without the participation of intermediaries, is possible, the so-called Quick Startup and the opportunity to stand on an equal footing with all software developers at once and offer their service to all people at once.  Ie, practically: a talented person places and organizes his service on the Internet 2.0, which becomes available to all Internet users, and if this service is in demand, consumers begin to pay for its services, and in case of failure, that's okay, no load for the supercomputer and no cost to startups.  It is quite possible that at the same time there will be some limit on the number of startups per month. </li><li>  Active protection of copyright and the fundamental suppression of violations, both independently and with the participation of the circles of authors (Art Councils), publicly elected by the authors themselves for a certain period of time. </li><li>  Evolutionary transition to the Internet 3.0.  Internet 2.0 serves as a means of protecting personal freedom and responsibility, as well as a tool for the manifestation of personal Creativity and its instant distribution.  Those.  is an active system of self-development of talented people, providing them with all the necessary opportunities, and those that do not - the opportunity to create them. </li></ol><br><h3>  Internet 2.0 structure and concepts </h3><br>  The basis of the structure of the Internet 2.0 in the technical part is the mobile virtual OS, located on specially made for it hardware complexes - supercomputers (not to be confused with the data center and DC). <br><br>  Supercomputers (SC) - are the same type, block-modular solution;  a set of modules in accordance with the purpose of the IC and the services provided.  SKs are designed for online load of several million people (for example, ICs of a city, region, country), but may be less, for example thematic communities: sports (football, hockey, etc.);  media (online theaters, digital TV in the house; TV author);  game (exchange of mod-s, community forums on a single IC, sites of relevant organizations coinciding with the theme of communities);  transport and passenger, tourist (system of management of motor transport of city, railway and air communications);  etc ... These and all other thematic communities and services are tools of social and economic transformation based on openness, clarity and free will of people, with the ability to actively protect their rights and freedom and promptly signal violation of their rights and freedoms to the whole thematic community .

      <br>
      Virtual OS integrates services and distributes the load on the hardware: in the event of an accident, it activates emergency modules, and in the case of idle time it disconnects unclaimed ones;  users continue to receive services online.  If necessary, the Universal Virtual OS can use the UK of another city-region, with the consent of users (for example, day-night mode: two cities of Tokyo in Japan and Marseille in France, while some sleep - others use their SC, then they changed). <br><br>  Virtual OS applications are virtualized and are contained on a single virtual repository server.  The author of the application just needs to update the version once and it will immediately be available on all ICs and all WIR.OS.  The speed of distribution (important for consumers), the availability of instant publishing throughout the Internet (important for authors), i.e.  No advertising is needed, your applications will be immediately accessible to all consumers and you will be on an equal footing with all software manufacturers.  so to speak, Internet 2.0 is the same for everyone and everyone is equal to it and to each other too.  You‚Äôll also need a copyright protection community. <br><br>  Personal data of users of virtual OS will be reliably protected and encrypted in databases in a special way.  At the same time for the user his information will be visible, and all the rest - only a set of encrypted data. <br><br>  Personal space (such as an account) - will be unique and it will contain full information about a person: passport details, where he lives, etc.  Users will determine their personal space on which IC to store;  they need to be stored in different SK.  In this case, the IC can move the user's personal space on his first request.  Their media files and large files, users can store securely and separately, as well, in encrypted form, without allowing there any prying eyes. <br><br>  In the case of immoral behavior of a person in a forum or community, you can bring him to justice and, if necessary, ‚Äúbanned‚Äù in personal space, and not in IP.  (Applicable to Copyright issues) <br><br>  Responsibility and restoring order is not the only function of personal space and interaction: <b>The highlight of the Internet 2.0 is that All links point to their author</b> , wherever he is and wherever he participates.  And this feature will easily help you find the author and contact him: for example, send him a message and it will reach the addressee.  By the way, e-mail is likely to cease to be in demand: it will become closer and easier to communicate via direct communication. <br><br>  Now, when entering the site, you will not have to create accounts - this will be resolved by the involved IC and virtual OS, the user will choose a participation pattern for such sites and determine the participation hall in his personal space.  Also in the personal space, the user will store their personal information that is not available for viewing by other persons, including  technical staff, and, accordingly, the security forces, even if they want - not to interfere in the privacy of citizens. <br><br>  In the participation hall there will be an isolated current online session of participation in the community, as soon as the UK‚Äôs RAM is released, there will be no need for anti-virus tools, although the anti-virus protection of the IC will be implemented by anti-virus protection inside and security certificates among themselves and / or actions user  Participation halls will be different: some for viewing sites about communication, some for personal creativity-work;  some to work with their media repository;  other destinations. <br><br><h3>  Means of access </h3><br>  To access the Internet, people will use both their PC and Universal Access Points (UTD).  UTD is somewhat similar to a thin client, only the possibilities are much wider.  The ATD will supply the following services: television, telephony (including videophone, cellular communication via IP), Internet access, connection of peripheral devices and storage devices, Wi-Fi;  contain a thin client and its functions.  Probably will have a modular design (the ability to expand the capabilities of the FTD of the above modules). <br><br>  The use of the FTD, in conjunction with SC (supercomputers), will allow to avoid an informational and technological blow to the minds of ordinary users (technological progress is replete with technical terms used by experts and which ordinary people who already own others do not need their special terms) and let go of technological progress SC, and not on the side of the PC or data center (including DCs, which are likely to be converted to the SC) and not ‚Äúload‚Äù people with unnecessary technological information.  It is also an opportunity not to buy a faster computer and not to dump your home computer for a long time, thereby reducing the waste of consumer society and saving on electricity (no need to build another nuclear power plant), increasing the efficiency and flexibility of using Information Technologies. <br><br>  Free Internet access 2.0, the use of the bandwidth of the infrastructure of Internet providers is 100%;  free access to cellular and landline services, BUT!  for the services provided, the fee will still be charged, BUT!  All statistics of income and expenditure of these companies should be freely available, so that a person knows that they are provided with services and independently select them in accordance with their vital interests, as well as be able to ‚Äúban‚Äù a company that violates its rights and freedom, notifying the entire thematic community and, if necessary, initiating an electronic vote on the withdrawal of a license for the right to operate this company.  Those.  it is an opportunity to regulate Internet services freely and independently - without state participation, increasing the responsiveness of the response and cutting off foreign interest, making free choice clean and fast. <br><br><h3>  Sample community topic: Internet services </h3><br>  In Internet 2.0, traffic and billing become irrelevant: anyone can connect to the Internet and view it completely free of charge, only services will be paid.  Of course, this could and should have been more appropriately called shareware Internet, but more about that. <br><br>  The fact is that by paying for the service, you still pay for the hardware and software part of the SC (supercomputer), the content of the Internet network (maintenance, electricity, business expenses of the companies providing the services).  But!  How do you do it !?  It is necessary to understand! <br><br>  You ‚Äúorder the music‚Äù, and the company ‚Äúperforms it‚Äù, while you pay the whole situation quite honestly, but!  You are not the only one, but do it together with other users of the same type of services and absolutely not necessarily the users of your city or country. <br><br>  It all starts with you: you choose the service you need, anywhere in the world, consume and pay for this service.  Further, the company that provided the service spends your funds on the maintenance of the insurance company, etc.  and reports to you on expenses incurred.  And that is not all!  The service company is obliged to pay and report on another cost item: the maintenance of the Internet network;  for this they are going to help the company-providers. <br><br>  Provider companies carry out their activities on the laying of the Internet and maintenance and uninterrupted functioning of the Internet in its specific area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility.  Provider companies summarize their costs and offer to accept their payment to service companies.  At the same time, you personally indicate to the service company what area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility they should accept for payment and pay on your behalf.  In principle, as an option, the service company can provide you with all the statistics of your Internet network usage and you will be able to pay the companies directly to the providers.  Technical capabilities to determine the amount of payment will also be. <br><br>  Payment options will be determined by users themselves by voting (always public).  For example, the rules of a ‚Äúcommon boiler‚Äù are when everyone pays the same way, or using an individual route;  or both complementing each other.  At the same time, the right of free choice is always yours and the rules are established by you, and not by any companies. <br><br>  In addition, the development of the insurance company to which ‚Äúyou assign‚Äù your participation channel (such as an account, account) also occurs with your submission: if there are more participants, a vote is initiated to add the corresponding module, and the service company simply executes your collective instructions .  In the event that the service company, for whatever reason, ignored your collective decisions (and you order the music), then you have the right to revoke the license (public vote) from this company or not to use its services at all. <br><br>  And, looking ahead, I will say that Internet companies will work without profit, i.e.  not mortgaging profits in their activities and will be maintained entirely at the expense of Internet users, actually providing Internet services. <br><br>  <b>It all starts with you and ends with you: this is how it all works.</b> <br><br><h5>  Here are the ideas that came to me: </h5><br>  online communities: <br>  - football hockey; <br>  - gaming (auto and railway simulators); <br>  - IT startup (the essence of the idea already mentioned); <br>  - protection of copyright (writers, singers, musicians) <br>  - education system (relevant for people over 30) <br><br>  Services: <br>  - urban transport; <br>  - a system of digital television and copyright broadcasting; <br>  - labor exchange;  work searches; <br>  - travel (tickets and stops); <br><br>  IT: <br>  - concepts of the structure of the Internet; <br>  - concepts of the structure of a virtual OS (use of viewing rooms, virtualized applications, etc.); <br>  - the concept of the structure of the IC (the necessary modules); <br>  - concepts of the structure of telephony, etc .; <br><br>  Does it make sense to publish them?  Are there IT specialists on this site who understand these concepts and are ready to offer some of their ideas and start building them up for implementation !? <br><br>  One day, while researching IT, I came across something new for me ‚Äî VMware virtualization and the possibility of application virtualization.  I didn‚Äôt really like the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãexploiting virtualization ideas actively developed by American companies solely for the sake of money and fame, so I decided, without knowing anything, to try to invent something on my own.  Happened.  The result was the concept of the Internet 2.0 and the trend-direction to the Internet 3.0.  But the technical Internet is not my element. <br><br>  I am familiar with the concepts of Internet 2.0;  I would like to see how they look together.  I understand that this requires (s) an <b>Architect (s) of Internet 2.0</b> , who knows (s) how to make a virtual OS, a network protocol (such as TCP IP), a hardware-electronic part (SC, FTD), databases (encrypted and open). <br><br>  <b>PS:</b> I am also a bit of an architect, but not the Internet 2.0, but in my part: evolutionary research;  therefore, public services are available to me and concepts are clear, but with the architecture of the Internet 2.0, technical, only those who are really interested can understand it and this is not in my part, but I can determine what is needed and what is unnecessary in the implementation of these services. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/136331/">https://habr.com/ru/post/136331/</a></p>
