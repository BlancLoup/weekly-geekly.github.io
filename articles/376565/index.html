In January, they experimented with the novelties of <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/mailru/blog/243897/">fantastic literature</a> and even <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/mailru/blog/244153/">board games</a> from all the same fiction.  Let's talk now about full-length fiction movies. <br><br>  Full-length fiction - a vast theme.  The number of sci-fi films made in the entire history of cinema has a great many.  Therefore, we decided to limit ourselves to certain time frames, say, the last ten years. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b><a href="http://afisha.mail.ru/cinema/movies/623088_ja_robot_i_robot/">I, the robot</a> (2004)</b>

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f8d/a77/bb2/f8da77bb2e904b9fac081eb4ee0921c5.jpg"><br><br>  Screen version of the story of Isaac Asimov.  In the future, robotics has allowed for the creation of highly sophisticated robots that caused mass unemployment.  But still people somehow adapted.  The main character is a policeman who does not have warm feelings for robots.  He has to investigate the murder in which the robot is involved, and moreover, there is a suspicion that he could violate one of the basic laws of robotics. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://afisha.mail.ru/cinema/movies/343120_ditja_chelovecheskoe/">Human Child</a> (2006)</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b71/e73/42b/b71e7342bbb3449d87ff8bfcdf150040.jpg"><br><br>  Humanity is living its last years.  For 18 years now, children have not been born on the entire planet.  Scientists can not find the cause of this curse that befell the human race.  Crime, millions of immigrants, poverty and lack of faith in the future reign around.  The ex-wife calls the main character and asks to help one person.  It turned out to be a young woman, the only pregnant woman in the whole world. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://afisha.mail.ru/cinema/movies/363509_mgla/">Haze</a> (2007)</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/acd/22f/f04/acd22ff0414b477f8c620de63658abe0.jpg"><br><br>  The film is based on the eponymous book by Stephen King.  The main characters, the father and his little son, went shopping at the supermarket.  However, they chose a very unfortunate time for shopping: after the last storm, a strange fog descended on their city, in which something is hidden, from which it is better to stay away. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://afisha.mail.ru/cinema/movies/418654_ja__legenda/">I am a legend</a> (2007)</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/303/b90/fc4/303b90fc47c240dfb8dcfe499b4cc75a.jpg"><br><br>  An unknown epidemic struck mankind, the overwhelming majority died, and a certain percentage turned into very dangerous creatures that could not tolerate the light of day (no, not vampires).  The only surviving protagonist, a military microbiologist, lives with his faithful dog in the empty metropolis and is trying to create a cure. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://afisha.mail.ru/cinema/movies/371834_monstro/">Monstro</a> (2008)</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2f5/51d/b3b/2f551db3bc744825b1d1a894e22d3385.jpg"><br><br>  The film is stylized as an amateur video.  In the evening, New York is attacked by a giant creature that has risen from the depths of the bay (hello to Godzilla).  A group of young people who gathered at a party at that moment are trying to escape from the chaos of the city. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://afisha.mail.ru/cinema/movies/498675_rajon_9/">District number 9</a> (2009)</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/62e/e14/8f7/62ee148f7b7f43519316ac506abda369.jpg"><br><br>  Cheerful and quite bogus movie.  In the recent past, an alien ship arrived on Earth and hovered over Johannesburg, the capital of South Africa.  It turned out that he was stuffed with insect-like humanoid aliens refugees.  They did not manage to drive them back; they had to allocate a plot in the suburbs for their residence.  He received the name "District number 9".  Over time, the camp turned into a slum ghetto.  One day, the authorities' patience dried up, and the aliens decided to move away from the city. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://afisha.mail.ru/cinema/movies/575267_gospodin_nikto/">Mr. Nobody</a> (2009)</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/064/351/c2f/064351c2f22a43c68016e091fc0d773e.jpg"><br><br>  This film kaleidoscope film mystery.  The biotechnologies of the future have allowed us to finally overcome the aging process, and the world is filled entirely with immortal youth.  The main character is 120 years old, and he is the last of the old survivors.  Talking about his biography to a slippery reporter, grandpa realizes that he seemed to have lived three completely different lives. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://afisha.mail.ru/cinema/movies/502367_luna_2112/">Moon 2112</a> (2009)</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8b9/d3d/e34/8b9d3de34dad4a80a701932547bbec50.jpg"><br><br>  After three years of lonely watch at the lunar gas station, Sam begins to pack up for the return flight home.  But shortly before the departure date, something inexplicable begins to happen to his memory, he begins to see very strange hallucinations.  In general, some unhealthy affairs are clearly going on at the station. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://afisha.mail.ru/cinema/movies/586450_nachalo/">Start</a> (2010)</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e6c/36f/c42/e6c36fc42c9f4862ab6089c06b8bae0c.jpg"><br><br>  The film is based on the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãpenetrating other people's dreams.  A group of talented adventurers is masterfully ‚Äúconnecting‚Äù to sleeping people in order to steal industrial and commercial secrets from them.  Once they decide on the biggest thing in their life, they need not to steal the idea, but implicitly introduce it into the consciousness of one important person.  But it turned out to be a very difficult task. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://afisha.mail.ru/cinema/movies/602520_tron_nasledie/">Tron: The Legacy</a> (2010)</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/577/48f/d16/57748fd165564a218c6c8762b385703a.jpg"><br><br>  The logical continuation of the movie "Tron" 1982.  This time, the main character was the son of programmer Kevin Flynn, who was the main character in the first film.  Kevin mysteriously disappears, and the son begins to search.  He also enters the virtual universe, finds his father there, and together they try to get out of there. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://afisha.mail.ru/cinema/movies/611162_oblasti_tmy/">Areas of Darkness</a> (2011)</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6eb/3db/27b/6eb3db27b77947deb6aaa88d874176ab.jpg"><br><br>  One New York writer has lost his inspiration and cannot write a single line.  The same thing, only allegorically, can be said about his personal life.  And here one old acquaintance who suggested miraculous tablets is turned up.  They gave unprecedented creative inspiration, gave confidence in affairs with the opposite sex and inspired them in general.  Alas, the action did not last long.  Coming for a new portion, our writer found his supplier dead.  It turned out that pills are needed by different influential people, and the miracle of pharmacy itself has serious side effects. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://afisha.mail.ru/cinema/movies/636494_petlja_vremeni/">The loop of time</a> (2012)</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c85/cb0/a79/c85cb0a793d043aa8389f1ba24715017.jpg"><br><br>  The future invented a way to travel in time.  It is not known how this opportunity began to be used with good intentions, but organized crime, with fiction, took advantage of this invention.  The victim was sent back in time, and as soon as the person appeared from the void, he was immediately killed by the killer.  The well-developed scheme failed when a young, skillful and soulless killer was sent from the future to eliminate him, only in years. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://afisha.mail.ru/cinema/movies/791310_ona">She</a> (2013)</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f93/b57/d1c/f93b57d1ceac4dde8903bd560b2eb6b1.jpg"><br><br>  In the not too distant future, artificial intelligence technology has evolved so much that it has become possible to create an incredibly realistic virtual personality.  More precisely, the virtual assistant.  The novelty went on sale under the name OS 1. The protagonist, who has not found the strength to sign divorce documents for a long time, works for a company to write personal letters to order.  Having bought a new OS for the sake of interest, he is surprised to discover this achievement of high technologies. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://afisha.mail.ru/cinema/movies/646471_zabvenie/">Oblivion</a> (2013)</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f22/b53/d4a/f22b53d4a6f847cab530353d406e8d8f.jpg"><br><br>  Great post-apocalyptic thriller.

The remnants of the population left their uninhabitable homeland and moved to Titan.  However, to maintain the life of the colony, water is needed, which is produced on Earth by giant automatic stations.  Two watchmen, whose tenure here ends soon, are kept on watch to look after them.  But one fine day an old spaceship crashes nearby, in which one survivor is discovered. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://afisha.mail.ru/cinema/movies/757474_gran_buduschego/">Edge of the Future</a> (2014)</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/121/d1e/f06/121d1ef06545431b940ef28a664d2025.jpg"><br><br>  Groundhog Day disguised as a war with aliens.

But by chance it turns out to be in the thick of battle.  In battle, he encounters a representative of a rare species of aliens, and, having killed him, dies himself.  But then "resurrected" in the past, one day before the start of the battle.  And each time dying in a new way, he again and again returns to the same moment. <br><br>  *** <br>  We deliberately did not write about some of the largest films and film versions of comics that have appeared in recent years, everyone already knows about them.  But what else would you add? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/376565/">https://habr.com/ru/post/376565/</a></p>
