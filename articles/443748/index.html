  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Presentation of Tesla Model Y - what to expect and where to look</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fz/jn/sd/fzjnsdvuldddpi30clsgnibig1c.jpeg"><br><br>  Last week, Ilon Musk <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/442540/">announced</a> that Tesla will present the new Model Y crossover on March 14th.  For us it will be early morning on the 15th, so tomorrow the details will be known.  We have so far speculated what to expect from a new model. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  There are a lot of confirmed and unconfirmed rumors about Model Y - whether it will be just an upgrade of Model 3 or a budget version of Model X. But the feeling is that the main thing this time will be not the characteristics of the electric car itself, but the details of its production.  Judging by the possible plans of the company, Model Y can greatly increase the overall volume of production. <br><br>  Last December, Business Insider gained access to Tesla's <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-internal-timeline-for-model-y-2018-11">internal documents</a> , which, among other things, said that the serial production would begin in August 2020 at the Gigafactory 1 plant in Nevada.  By December of the same year, the company plans to produce seven thousand electric vehicles of this model per week.  And in a couple of months, in February 2021, the production lines at the Gigafactory 3 plant in China will produce another five thousand electric vehicles per week.

      Tesla did not confirm all this information, saying that the documents are already outdated, and the plans have changed.  Too ambitious, if in a big way - but it's a pity, if in a smaller one.  Nevertheless, Ilon Musk eventually said that he was convinced of the importance of bringing the car to the market as quickly as possible.  Therefore, 75% of Model 3 parts will be used in Model Y, which may hint at unification and acceleration. <br><br>  As he said, with the new car Tesla will make a "revolution in production."  Perhaps the revolution is precisely to produce about half a million more cars a year to the other models.  And according to <a href="https://insideevs.com/monthly-plug-in-sales-scorecard/%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR3xFzrravqC18UpBkCVYWX-plxmz4xhndpCKFN1O0T3yBCXMQql3CB710o">insideeevs</a> , only in America Tesla sold approximately 200 thousand cars (S, X and 3 together) for 2018. <br><br>  Igor Antarov from the Moscow Tesla Club told us which specific new products to expect from the model. <br><blockquote>  This is a compact crossover, which will be smaller and cheaper than the Model X, while it will incorporate all the experience that Tesla gained by launching the recently massive compact Tesla Model 3 sedan. The car will also assemble a new battery technology on larger cells, and new efficient permanent magnet motors, and fast charging technology with Supercharger V3 support (250kW - charging up to 120 km in 5 minutes) and the latest Tesla autopilot development, including a new chip for neural networks that will be 5-20 times faster than the existing one equip  Ania Nvidia and allow the autopilot to operate reliably in the city. </blockquote><br>  To judge the appearance too early.  In the dim image of the Model Y, people try to draw conclusions about the size of the body, glasses and mirrors, but everything is still hidden by darkness.  Here the blogger tried to unscrew the brightness of the image, and came across the inscription ‚ÄúNot a bad attempt‚Äù, to which Ilon only winked. <br><br><div class="oembed"><twitter-widget class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" id="twitter-widget-0" style="position: static; visibility: visible; display: block; transform: rotate(0deg); max-width: 100%; width: 500px; min-width: 220px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" data-tweet-id="1104462447652438016"></twitter-widget><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>  <i>(I tried it too, but nothing is there. It's just a joke)</i> <br><br>  For now, one of the most talked about features is the possible three rows of seats and ‚Äúordinary‚Äù doors.  ‚ÄúMany still do not believe that the doors will be ordinary, but not falcon wings, as in Model X. We are waiting for an answer to this and other questions.  None of the presentations of Ilona Mask has yet passed without surprises, ‚Äùsays Igor. <br><br>  But again, one of the most interesting in the presentation is how much the car will be fitted to the actual mass production. <br><blockquote>  For example, Tesla stated that it plans to abandon the old 12-volt car battery in the next car, which is used when the regular battery is disconnected.  It would seem a small change, but the rejection of this last artifact of past cars will reduce the amount of wiring in the car, and thus simplify the automation of production (the task of laying cables badly given to robots), which affects the cost and delivery time.  Also 12V battery, this is another extra unit that can break and which is great to remove.  On the other hand, Tesla should not move far from the Model 3 platform, in order to unify production.  I wonder what decision the engineering team took. </blockquote><br>  The presentation will be held in Los Angeles, in the design studio of the company.  Moscow Tesla Club will be broadcast live in Russian at 6 am Moscow time on its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/DealerTeslaRU/featured">Youtube channel</a> .  They will shoot reports from the scene and promise to show test drives. <br><br>  After the presentation, we will collect all the facts in one article, and, perhaps, find out even more than they tell on the stage. <br><br>  Ilon Mask himself is hinting at meme with a hedgehog that the presentation will be S3XY. <br><br><div class="oembed"><twitter-widget class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" id="twitter-widget-1" style="position: static; visibility: visible; display: block; transform: rotate(0deg); max-width: 100%; width: 500px; min-width: 220px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" data-tweet-id="1106063248581894144"></twitter-widget><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/443748/">https://habr.com/ru/post/443748/</a></p>
