And very often you can hear <br>  that our whole mentality and standard of living is to blame.  But each of us can provide real assistance by allocating a small amount. <br><br>  <em>Transferred from the CMS section</em> <br><br>  Collected at the moment: <strong>1021 rubles and $ 5</strong> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The <a href="http://www.modx-cms.ru/">MODx-cms.ru</a> community decided to organize a collection to help their favorite <strong>MODx</strong> system, which many people know and use.  Soon we are waiting for the release of version 0.9.7, which will continue to develop a unique concept and give us <a href="http://www.modx-cms.ru/plan-rabot-roadmap.html">new opportunities</a> .  And there and to the first version close.

      <a href="http://modxcms.com/">The guys</a> are working tirelessly, confirming the title of the <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/article/modx-wins-most-promising-open-source-cms">most promising system in 2007</a> .  They work so that we can make a lot of new projects, <strong>make money on it and live better</strong> . <br><br>  Let's let the guys understand that we appreciate their efforts and are also ready to help as much as we can.  This event will certainly have an impact on the development of MODx. <br><br>  You can send your help to wallets specially organized by the community: <br><ul><li>  WMR: <strong>R416339765141</strong> </li><li>  WMZ: <strong>Z379788536355</strong> </li><li>  Yandex.Money: <strong>41001231581389</strong> </li></ul><br><br>  <strong>All funds will be transferred <a href="http://modxcms.com/">to MODx developers</a> (eng)!</strong> <br><br>  You can also send help to <a href="http://www.modxcms.com/donate.html">developers directly</a> . <br><br>  The text is taken from the <a href="http://www.modx-cms.ru/podderzhat-razrabotchikov-modx.html">permanent page of the action on the MODx-cms.ru project</a> . <br><br><h2>  About project MODx-cms.ru </h2><br><br>  The project exists for <strong>half a year</strong> and was created to resolve issues that arise with the use of MODx (lack of documentation, solutions, a platform for resolving issues, sharing experience, etc.) <br><br>  This is an unofficial community!  The official community is <a href="http://modx.ru/">modx.ru</a> <br><br><h2>  Relations with modx.ru </h2><br><br>  So, as this attitude has become the most discussed topic, then I offer a brief account of the history of events. <br><br>  The MODx-cms.ru project appeared on the basis of a conflict with the official community of modx.ru, which refused to take any initiatives to develop the Russian community, accumulate documentation, etc. <br>  Quote posts representative team modx.ru <br><br><blockquote>  Continuing the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãMetaller about popularizing the system, I will say. <br>  Most people who want to use modx do not want to understand it, opensource = freebie for them.  Good luck to them. <br>  Most people who use modx and who have dealt with it do not write on the forum about how they solved their questions.  They decided them and they do not care for others. <br>  Now give me at least one motive other than my personal interests, which are known only to me, why should I spend most of my time on solving other people's problems, so that everyone should be satisfied?  it is rather not a question, but just information for thought. <br>  And to make at least some sense in this post, I summarize: <br>  1. here is not a free help forum for creating your sites.  here is a place for people to communicate USING modx.  If you do not have time and desire to deal with the system - this system is not for you. <br>  2. here no one sets goals other than solving their problems.  therefore, it is not necessary to ‚Äúwave flags‚Äù about popularization, promotion. <br>  3. here you will be treated as you treat the rest.  and you will be judged by contribution to the community. <br></blockquote><br><br>  We went against it and organized our site, which we are gradually developing by the participants.  And for our initiative, we constantly feel pressure from ‚Äúofficial‚Äù representatives.  They also do not support this action and will not transfer money. <br><br><h2>  Summary </h2><br><br>  Everyone has the right to decide whether to entrust us money or not.  This is a personal initiative of the MODx-cms.ru project, which is organized as a mark of respect for the developers.  That's all.  If you do not believe us, but want to help, then send your help directly. <br><br>  I hope that I answered the basic questions that worried you.  And there will be more thoughts on the topic.  If you just regret the money, then just ignore the action, it is not to search for enemies. <br><br>  To help or not is <strong>your personal</strong> business.  Nobody forces you to do this, but if you still feel that the developers should be thanked, then we are not all in vain.  But mercantile spirit does not need to be justified by various philosophical reflections and the search for dirty tricks. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/24359/">https://habr.com/ru/post/24359/</a></p>
