More precisely, the vision of 20 professions, which, according to the authors, will be in great demand in the next decade. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the past, people built their careers steadily and linearly.  Everyone chose one path in life and adhered to it from college to retirement.  But in this age of exponential technology development, such a model no longer works.  Today, building your career is a complex, fragmented process, we have to specialize in a narrow area and constantly cooperate with others.  More than ever, this process requires the involvement of other people.  Often our portfolio consists of a list of <i>microcaviers</i> .
