  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Who goes to your site?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Meet this - <code><a href="http://www.netchart.ru/"></a> www.netchart.ru</code>  <code><a href="http://www.netchart.ru/"></a> www.netchart.ru</code> is a new service that gives you the opportunity to see for free a detailed portrait of the audience of any resource in Runet, simply by entering its URL.  Please love and respect. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a58/b5a/c61/a58b5ac613893387a4ac534b57e24a1b.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  On Netchar - a lot of statistics.  For example, you can rate the audience of any site on the Internet by demographic indicators. <br><br>  <b>Who needs it and why?</b> <br>  Webmasters do not need to explain why it is important to know the audience of your site.  It is difficult to imagine that the webmaster wondered what kind of visitors he has more: girls or boys - in what area they work and what their education is.  In addition to all kinds of curiosities, such statistics are an indirect tool for selling advertising on a site, as a webmaster, for example, will be able to hang a report on the advertising possibilities of his site. <br><br>  In addition, there are specific marketing objectives that our data helps to solve.  There is, for example, such a problem: in order to choose a suitable platform for displaying advertising on the Internet, the advertiser and his agency are forced to proceed from the positioning of the site, but it does not always coincide with the real picture.  I will give an example: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Cosmopolitan positions itself as a publication for successful women, but in fact it is read by mostly undergraduate students, because the materials start to repeat even before the girl graduates from college.  Conclusion: the positioning did not coincide with the actual audience, so today in the Cosmopolitan magazine and on the Cosmo.ru website you can see advertising of an expensive spa-salon less and less.  But actively advertised Student-project.ru. <br><br>  Thus, Netchart can serve as an advertiser or media planner of an advertising agency as an alternative source of information about the audience of each site. <br><br>  <b>Competitors</b> <br>  Until Netchart in RuNet was not available and complete statistics on the audience of sites.  All services have at least one of the following problems: <br>  1. Expensive.  The well-known in Russia "monsters" Internet analysts offer a solution for hundreds of thousands of rubles.  For webmasters - not an option, so we do not need to be included in the discussion about the problems of their statistics. <br>  2. Not enough.  The lack of statistics based on counters is that many webmasters prohibit the publication of their data.  For example, in the ‚ÄúMeet and Meet‚Äù category, only 6 of the top 30 sites opened their statistics for viewing.  Moreover, such services either do not consider the audience‚Äôs portrait at all, or they are considered very conditional. <br>  3. Inaccurate.  Alexa, Quantcast and other com sites provide enough data on demographics, but they have few panelists in the .ru zone, so they don‚Äôt fit us. <br><br>  <b>Alex</b> <br>  We‚Äôll dwell on Alex in more detail, since on Habr√© this resource is especially ‚Äúloved‚Äù. <br>  Alexey and I have similar methods - they and we have user-centric research.  The meaning is this: a panelist, having filled out a questionnaire about himself, installs on his computer a toolbar or a user application - i.e.  something that sends information about his transitions to our database.  Then we sort it all out, do it nicely and clearly and output it to netchart.ru. <br>  Of course, we very carefully read all Habralyud reviews about Alex before writing this post.  And they came to the following conclusions: <br>  1. The main disadvantage of Alex is that the data of this service is not about the Russian part of the Internet.  There are few Russian panelists, so for us, Alex is "crooked."  We have only Russian-speaking panelists, and therefore full-scale users of the RuNet. <br>  2. Judging by the number of links to Alex, this resource ranks third after McDonald's and condoms in the list of things that everyone hates, but still uses. <br><br>  <b>Accuracy</b> <br>  One can argue for a long time about how much the error of this research method is higher or lower than that of competitors.  But to judge the accuracy of the information in our case, you can simply: a lot of panelists - a good base, few panelists - a bad base.  We have several tens of thousands of panelists and their number is growing very quickly, so Netchart statistics are already representative of the resources visited and it becomes more accurate every day. <br><br>  <b>Bugs</b> <br>  Whatever statistics you use, do not forget to connect common sense.  If you understand the specifics of database compilation, it becomes clear, for example, why Netchart, like Alex, is not representative of sites with low traffic.  If some page is visited by 100-200 people per day, it is not surprising that only one of them can be included in the number of our panelists, which means that in Netchart statistics 100% of visitors to this site may turn out to be men of 45-54 years old who are not married.  Moreover, this resource may well be the promo site of the depilator, and the only man went there by chance at the request of "hair loss". <br><br>  <b>Feedback</b> <br>  <i>We would be very interested to hear your opinion about our project, especially if you are a webmaster or are related to the Internet advertising market.</i> <br><br>  <b>UPD: First of all, thanks to everyone for pointing out mistakes and valid criticism.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>All trifles, like autocomplex, domains with www, scientific notation of numbers, and so on, were fixed yesterday.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>According to the sotsdemu we are now conducting a survey, today most likely there will be more accurate results.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/67470/">https://habr.com/ru/post/67470/</a></p>
