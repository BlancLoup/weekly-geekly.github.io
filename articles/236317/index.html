This time, the hero of this review is Zenfone 4, the youngest member of the series.  As the name implies, we have Zenfone with a screen diagonal of 4 inches, while the recommended price of the device is 4 thousand rubles.  It‚Äôs hard to stand out among low-end devices, but you shouldn‚Äôt bypass this smartphone side, ASUS found a couple of trump cards up its sleeve, which I‚Äôll cover in this review. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e8d/a3e/ebe/e8da3eebe1a54930a10d82933e56282a.JPG"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fab/d55/26b/fabd5526be8963542dd6d085ad0f953c.png" alt="image">  Specifications </h4><br>  <b>Software:</b> Android JellyBean 4.3 and later upgrade to Android KitKat 4.4. <br>  <b>Processor:</b> Intel¬Æ Atom ‚Ñ¢ Multi-Core Z2520 1.2 GHz 2-core, support for Hyper-Threading. <br>  <b>Video:</b> PowerVR SGX544MP2. <br>  <b>RAM:</b> 1 GB LPDDR2. <br>  <b>Screen:</b> 4 "800x480, LED-backlight, TFT, up to 10 simultaneous touches. <br>  <b>Built-in memory:</b> 8 GB. <br>  <b>Connectivity:</b> 802.11b / g / n, Bluetooth 4.0, GSM / EDGE 850/900/1800/1900, WCDMA 850/900/1900/2100, DC-HSPA + (DL / UL): 42 / 5.76 Mbps. <br>  <b>Navigation:</b> GPS, A-GPS, GLONASS. <br>  <b>Sensors:</b> gyroscope, proximity sensor. <br>  <b>Interfaces:</b> 3.5 mm mini-jack for headset, micro SD up to 64 GB, 2 slots for microSIM, micro USB (OTG support). <br>  <b>Cameras:</b> front VGA F2.8, main 5 MP with autofocus. <br>  <b>Battery:</b> 1600 mAh, lithium-polymer, removable. <br>  <b>Dimensions:</b> 124.4x61.44x12.3 mm. <br>  <b>Weight:</b> 120 g <br>  <b>Colors:</b> black, white, red, yellow, turquoise <br><br><h4><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c56/979/cc0/c56979cc05889a6fe79b40bbc1659866.png" alt="image">  Equipment </h4><br>  Zenfone 4 comes in a compact box the size of the phone itself.  As you can see, the same packaging design is used for the entire Zenfone series. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3b4/05d/466/3b405d466cd64f86981fc87435f9f87a.JPG"><br><br>  On the side face there is a perforation with icons indicating the main advantages of the device.

      The phone itself lies in the film, under it is a standard set of accessories: power supply and micro USB cable. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/008/d84/122/008d84122b0041a499bb869715473ebf.JPG"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5e2/f50/2cc/5e2f502cc560434fbe44d3c2b7db9702.JPG"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/071/a1c/821/071a1c82187f436e982250be5f17b514.JPG"><br><br>  The power supply is powerful enough, 5.2 V and 1.35 A. There are no glossy parts on its case, everything is opaque, respectively, it does not collect fingerprints. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7c2/35a/9a3/7c235a9a36484a70937bbc07679326db.JPG"><br><br><h4><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/523/d0c/575/523d0c57560704cfdd653b746ef7cb56.png" alt="image">  Appearance </h4><br>  The ASUS line of smartphones called Zenfone consists of 3 devices: these are Zenfone 4, 5 and 6. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0c9/ba1/e91/0c9ba1e91d764978b5a656e836ed803b.jpg"><br><br>  The concentric circles at the bottom remind us of Zenbook laptops. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/384/546/466/38454646645d4bfe87230063866a9f5f.JPG"><br><br>  Zenfone 4 is the most compact representative of the series.  The smartphone has dimensions of 124 by 61 mm and fits perfectly in your hand.  Unlike the current trend to produce large smartphones, ASUS does not forget about other users who are not so important to the large screen diagonal.  The main advantage of small smartphones is convenience, they don‚Äôt need to get used to them, unlike 6-inch phones, and it‚Äôs convenient to work with them with one hand. <br>  The thickness of the smartphone is 12 mm, but it is not strongly felt, as the phone is thinning towards the edges.  Due to this geometry, the back of the smartphone repeats the palm of the hand, and the phone fits well in the hand. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fe2/d41/4d7/fe2d414d7575454dbde6678b5d04c36a.JPG"><br><br>  The back cover of the smartphone is made of matte, slightly rough plastic.  The coating is pleasant to the touch and does not collect fingerprints. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/df8/413/235/df8413235bb54d81ad72f3c98c50b586.JPG"><br><br>  The lid covers not only the back, but also the side faces, i.e.  The volume and lock buttons are located on the panel itself.  Such a decision creates the effect of solidity and indivisibility of the smartphone.  But the back panel is easily removed and provides access to a removable battery, microSD connector and two SIM-cards. <br>  The panel holds tightly to a large number of latches, does not creak or stagger anything. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/776/2f7/4f6/7762f74f68d740a0aebbd8e667fc2222.JPG"><br><br>  In addition to white, there are more models in other colors: black, red, yellow and turquoise. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e7d/219/04e/e7d21904ec1f4250b3440051a230f69f.jpg"><br><br><h4><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/83e/263/1fe/83e2631fe4f0568e651d869004209200.png" alt="image">  Interfaces </h4><br>  Above the screen is a speaker, covered with a metal grid.  The interlocutor is heard well, the volume is high.  To the left of the speaker indicator for alerts.  When you receive various alerts, for example, missed calls or messages, the indicator will blink green.  Also, the smartphone will inform about the low battery capacity and the process of charging the smartphone.  To the right of the front camera is a distance sensor to lock the screen during a call.  Alas, we face a budget device and a light sensor is missing, so the brightness will have to be set manually. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4f4/936/b7a/4f4936b7acc144feb823432e9ef0701c.JPG"><br><br>  Under the screen are the usual touch buttons: back, main screen and application manager.  The sensor is quite sensitive, the buttons have no backlight.  In the system, you can adjust the vibration when you press these buttons.  By the way, the vibration is very strong and feels good even while walking. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dee/453/016/dee45301625142cea8741ff1a00cd7c7.JPG"><br><br>  On the right side is the volume rocker, a little higher - the unlock button.  The location of the buttons is not the most convenient, with my grip the thumb rests just on the increase in volume and you have to get used to the fact that unlocking is higher.  The buttons themselves have a corrugated texture and are nicely pressed. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1c5/a11/753/1c5a11753d844f8580ead5effc5e0872.JPG"><br><br>  The microphone is on the bottom. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fcb/4a8/65c/fcb4a865c25f42fd87186841a44bcca4.JPG"><br><br>  Connector for charging and syncing micro USB placed on the left side. <br>  It supports OTG, i.e.  You can connect flash drives and various peripherals.  Unfortunately, the microUSB-OTG cable is not included, it will have to be bought separately. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ee1/7f3/0ec/ee17f30ec96c4a37ba361ef36e57bcbb.JPG"><br><br>  A standard 3.5 mm mini jack for the headset is located on the top. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/385/e1c/d70/385e1cd706be4212aaf070b53903a535.JPG"><br><br>  Removing the back cover, we get access to the slots for two SIM-cards of the micro-SIM form factor.  The radio module is one, when talking on one SIM-card, the second one will be unavailable. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/80c/13e/98f/80c13e98fcb848fdaa87bb721fa82cfb.JPG"><br><br>  We also have a slot for connecting a micro SD card (up to 64GB) to increase the memory capacity of the smartphone. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/604/9e7/df5/6049e7df5bee493aba635ea6e47ac836.JPG"><br><br><h4><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bb1/f60/8bc/bb1f608bc08a74f3b3980bf40ca45595.png" alt="image">  Screen </h4><br>  As already mentioned, there is a screen with a diagonal of 4 inches.  This model is the most affordable among Zenfone, and therefore received a conventional TFT-matrix with LED-backlit. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e44/838/ebf/e44838ebf4be4b1bb6327baed7b3c416.JPG"><br><br>  But technologies are not standing still, and TFT screens look better and better every year.  The screen resolution is 800 by 480 pixels, 223 dots per inch (PPI). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c9e/c1e/8b5/c9ec1e8b572948be9c8a78f7f369aa50.JPG"><br><br>  The image is poorly visible in the sun and you have to set the maximum brightness.  In general, the screen looks good, the colors are displayed correctly, the viewing angles are not too large, but we don‚Äôt expect more from such a budget phone. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9d2/cc3/f9f/9d2cc3f9fb1e41998fb302c212d0db58.JPG"><br><br>  The screen has a protective coating, during use no scratches appeared.  There is also an oleophobic coating, due to which the finger slides well and less prints remain. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b9e/565/e7e/b9e565e7ee204a378930412cd666e421.JPG"><br><br>  The screen supports up to 10 simultaneous touches. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/785/e48/4ea/785e484eaf404d4486f4343059e520ab.jpg"><br><br><h4><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/278/5d7/6d8/2785d76d8aca5b51a2a52fc69a8dd389.png" alt="image">  Camera </h4><br>  The front camera has a small resolution and is useful only for video calls.  The picture quality is satisfactory. <br>  The main camera with a 5 megapixel matrix and an F2.4 aperture gives out good photos of average quality.  On the screen, you can choose which part of the frame to focus on.  The camera application allows you to use has many interesting modes. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f38/565/f76/f38565f76b2949c7a7bb78e6cd02d4ae.JPG"><br><br>  <b>Intellectual removal.</b>  Convenient mode when you need to take a photo in a public place.  5 photos are taken and moving objects are deleted from the final image.  The function really works, even in low light. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7c7/583/87f/7c758387f14f4613aa1d31373660bee8.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Everyone is smiling.</b>  A great tool for creating group photos.  The camera takes 5 pictures, after that for each person you can select a good frame and glue everything into one photo. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/794/7f1/8ee/7947f18ee2c544caa2f87af5d334bbc8.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Your picture.</b>  Selfies are moving to a new level.  Now there is a handy tool to shoot yourself on the main camera.  To start, select the number of people (from 1 to 4), which will be in the photo.  After that, the camera goes into face search mode.  If two faces are selected, then while the camera does not recognize the second face in the frame, shooting will not occur.  The whole process is accompanied by a sound indication, for example, if the second person is not in the frame, then a signal will be given.  After the photo is taken, you can choose a good frame of the three proposed.  Then you can immediately process the photo - correct the tone, make more eyes or narrow the cheeks.  In general, the girls will be happy. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ecb/b30/283/ecbb302838d047a59234d358a701e7bf.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Depth of field</b>  Allows you to blur the background, thereby shifting the focus to the foreground objects.  The function is interesting, but it does not always work as it should. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ee8/3ab/892/ee83ab89276b41789afca78ebb5f19bd.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Time control</b>  Convenient mode for shooting children.  After shooting you will be offered 31 photos taken within 2 seconds before pressing the shutter and within 1 second after.  Twisting the slider, you can select a good frame with a little restless. <br><br>  <b>Miniature.</b>  The so-called Tilt Shift.  Objects in the photo become as miniature.  Such photos should be done from a high point of view. <br>  There are also modes that can be found in almost all modern smartphones with a camera: HDR, 360-degree panorama, night, low light, face enhancement, GIF animation. <br>  <a href="https://yadi.sk/d/0ptC7XPybMWFT">Archive of photos</a> taken on Zenfone 4. <br><br><h4><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/118/3ab/d19/1183abd19b1558a27ebb716941448e9f.png" alt="image">  Performance </h4><br>  The hardware platform of the smartphone is built on a mobile solution from Intel.  The new 2-core Atom Z2520 processor with a frequency of 1.2 GHz has support for Hyper-Threading, which adds to it two virtual cores.  The amount of RAM is 1 GB.  The graphic accelerator PowerVR SGX544MP2 copes well with its task, showing a high frame rate in games.  There are no problems with drawing the interface, everything works smoothly. <br><br>  <i>Video with the launch of games: Dead Trigger 2, Riptide GP2, Asphalt 8, Modern Combat 4.</i> <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/kkKL8CWWQp0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjVavvmM2J907wHWljgJOxvwUh4Ag" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h5>  Benchmark results. </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3d0/0e9/36b/3d00e936b511440c9af8f8a946b83d91.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/952/35b/a7f/95235ba7fdaa4667ac8653df3e0f1200.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9ef/7a6/8b7/9ef7a68b792d480281e7a36dc5a92771.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d08/308/dda/d08308ddaae3440ba0bec13ff13e0fa1.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/14a/6e3/f00/14a6e3f00a724c00b35ef8bd03b398b9.jpg"><br><br>  The speed of the mobile Internet in the MTS network, according to measurements, was about 5 Mbit.

It is easy to learn and intuitive, looks nice, icons have become simpler and follow modern trends in user interfaces.  Standard applications are also altered in favor of the overall concept.  In general, from ZenUI only good impressions. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bc8/c0d/84d/bc8c0d84d496433ab4d18b68eb228c5c.jpg"><br><br>  The device is running Android 4.3, but ASUS promises to upgrade to version 4.4 KitKat. <br>  <i>Interface screenshots.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e2c/51b/f62/e2c51bf62c0544f6808358ff771c3227.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5e7/56f/bd8/5e756fbd80b946dea2516a05ce288db9.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e24/2f4/294/e242f4294eb249ec814244179f60cace.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/99b/80a/ac7/99b80aac7ddf413a9347ecb178e07bf8.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/23b/081/d2e/23b081d2e39946e881a5f66f08ad4057.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/838/8e8/0e7/8388e80e7a134953a3306fed0fac9537.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0ee/109/004/0ee109004b9f47349b490dbe17ccf194.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9fb/7e7/03a/9fb7e703a4cd4736b6957a2f4d1ccd9c.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b67/46a/73c/b6746a73cd644dd6ab76b7e0038fb64f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c57/aab/07b/c57aab07b69e4451979fff6431ff36d1.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c4c/7c1/58d/c4c7c158d334410aa2fd43b53fff5d13.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1c3/6b1/34d/1c36b134d2444b8dae7cd9023d248b05.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d9f/4d1/274/d9f4d1274e584dcca1eee3be87f6c162.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f00/9d1/61f/f009d161f72c4307b14ffdd2fc13d62c.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9ca/52f/83c/9ca52f83c40c4dd7ad9f96e5b2ba9c3f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cce/96c/b88/cce96cb887f24b78bc27522aa1d47e94.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0e9/b91/078/0e9b910780274f47983ca82ed2534c1a.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/600/60f/042/60060f042c924bfe80e3204a521c36d3.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/302/cb2/669/302cb26690db4d37909ff038492b37a7.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/124/4ca/497/1244ca4976f145afab46ba3f12c9e97d.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/75e/222/c57/75e222c57b42453cb930b76298b33009.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/015/e23/821/015e238211bf46c095e9601ab3f7cb63.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d8f/f0a/6ad/d8ff0a6ad47f47dc99aa410ac81e3db7.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8de/b08/836/8deb088360214d598d8bf89c90ae2cdd.jpg"><br><br><h4><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/806/648/9c3/8066489c3773afb679206056553d193a.png" alt="image">  Battery and working time </h4><br>  Removable lithium-polymer battery has a modest capacity of 1600 mAh, but for a small screen and an energy-efficient processor this is enough.  In the settings, you can choose different modes of the phone, which will extend the time. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/06f/16d/569/06f16d569bfe4384a4a93d4b244812e4.JPG"><br><br>  In power saving mode, the machine will turn on the wireless connection only with the active screen.  Using the optimized mode, I did not notice any restrictions, everything works as usual.  You can flexibly configure the backlight for videos or websites, set permissions for instant messengers to use the Internet. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bd8/c4d/0bc/bd8c4d0bcdc44f3f986d19969d4e1834.jpg"><br><br>  In the evening I fully charged the phone and left it overnight without charging.  During the day, I used Wi-Fi for a little over an hour to browse sites.  Mobile Internet was also constantly turned on, messages came regularly to Viber and Gmail with auto-reception of letters, rather than checking the box at a certain time.  There were voice calls for about 25 minutes.  By 8 pm, the phone was almost completely discharged. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/346/194/1fd/3461941fd784464ba77550be9bcb3515.jpg"><br><br>  In general, the result is quite good, like most smartphones, the phone works one ‚Äúlight day‚Äù. <br><br><h4><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bee/d6b/d74/beed6bd748e33265d3657e51f5d906b5.png" alt="image">  Conclusion </h4><br>  So, in the ranks of budget smartphones appeared symbolic representative of this class.  For 3990 rubles, we get a compact and convenient smartphone with good performance.  Although the screen resolution is not so big, but for a 4-inch diagonal this is enough, the picture looks good.  It was also unusual to see the presence of protective glass.  The new shell ZenUI is beautiful and works quickly, in general, only good feelings remain from use.  Among the shortcomings, a small capacity battery can be noted, but it copes well with its task, and the phone remains in touch until the evening. <br><br>  <i>Recommended price is 3990 rubles.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/236317/">https://habr.com/ru/post/236317/</a></p>
