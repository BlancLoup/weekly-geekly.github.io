Involuntary saccades arise when it is necessary to subject the region to a more detailed examination. <br><br>  The result of the work of traps for the look are the areas of paintings that either spontaneously attract attention to themselves or on which it is absolutely impossible to concentrate without additional efforts. Geometric figures can serve as examples of traps, whose peculiarity to catch the eye is based on a visual ranking in color.

      Why is this happening?  To understand this, we need to recall the information given in the second part, and specifically about the complementary colors: the color of one brightness, surrounded by the background of the complementary color, tends to be perceived more strongly by consciousness.  Another effect of perception of color boundaries is the fact that the boundaries between colors adjacent to the color wheel tend to be perceived by the consciousness as less important, less sharp: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b3b/89b/b7f/b3b89bb7f7821c80d4915ba2bc5f87d9.jpg"><br><br>  The border between the pink and blue squares (right) is perceived more clearly than between blue and green (left).  As a result, in the left picture, the power of perception of the border between the squares is less than the force of perception of the border between the blue square and the background.  Because of this, it creates the impression that the gaze ‚Äúruns‚Äù from the center, ‚Äúattracting‚Äù to the outer contours of the blue square.  In the second case (picture on the right), the blue square enhances the perception of the inner square, which is why the center of the figure begins to subjectively attract the eye. <br><br>  But the contours given in the example are open and not able to hold attention for a long time, let's try to really catch the wandering look: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ae8/977/41f/ae897741fbb16074b748ab580dd6df89.jpg"><br><br>  The figure in the picture consists of several nested contours, the color borders of which are connected in such a way that the eye constantly ‚Äúavoids‚Äù the external border and ‚Äúattracts‚Äù to the internal ones. <br><br>  As soon as the look fixes the border of any contour (for example, a red square in the center), he immediately sees a more attractive, ‚Äúcomplex‚Äù border at the side, and, accordingly, makes a small saccade in this direction.  Then he sees what?  Right!  That side there is another attractive border. <br><br>  Because of the reflex assessments of the power of perception of boundaries, a trapped look will long be thrown between the central red square and the blue contour surrounding it. <br><br><h2>  Outlines and power of perception </h2><br><br>  Exactly the same joke can be turned using the subjective assessment of the ‚Äústrength of the borders‚Äù not of color (or not only color), but also the complexity of the contours.  The simplest example is the following image: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a15/e44/144/a15e44144ec90f07ab776b49e3ab0ee0.jpg"><br><br>  Look at the left picture.  The fixation of attention on it is transferred between the center (the red dot in the picture on the right), where the most subjectively complex contour is located (the greatest density of crowded multidirectional well-distinguishable curves), and the point below the triangle between the figure and the border (the blue dot in the picture on the right), which when fixing the gaze in the center, it has in its surroundings the following contour of study complexity. <br><br>  <b>Moreover, this set of contours as a result of the involuntary fixation of the gaze at two points will most likely be remembered as ‚Äúdamn it with the left-sided and the triangle below‚Äù!</b> <br><br>  The complexity or power of perception can also dictate emotionally-recognizable contours.  For example, it is known that the areas identified by the brain as the face, eyes, and lips ‚Äúattract the eye.‚Äù  Well-defined contours of the lips and eyes on the contour of the face can form pairs and triads of centers of gravity of attention.  It is because of this that when one remembers a photograph or a painting, one often shares the impression that "his blue eyes and sensual lips attracted the eye." <br><br>  <b>Eye traps not only dictate the trajectories of the saccades, but also determine the impression and memory of what they see!</b> <br><br>  Another type of contours that make up the trap for a look are subjective contours: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4c0/18d/8e1/4c018d8e1c76d719d0262300e0ca953a.jpg"><br><br>  The picture clearly shows a delineated circle, a triangle and a half ring, which are not actually depicted. <br><br>  <b>Subjective contours arise after the initial processing of the picture by consciousness and are stronger than the contours usual.</b> <br><br>  By the way, the <b>illusion of three-dimensionality created when viewing a two-dimensional picture has a greater subjective attraction than a picture perceived as two-dimensional</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/276/5b3/6cc/2765b36cc7c68ced4a0b31fb59b14141.jpg"><br>  <sup>The difference in the power of perception of two-dimensional and "three-dimensional" contour.</sup> <br><br><h2>  The structure of the trap for a look </h2><br><br>  <b>A gaze trap consists of a pair or a triad of equidistant spotlights.</b> <br><br>  Each center of attention is formed in one of the following ways (in order of decreasing perception power): <br><br><ol><li>  Psychologically active contour (face, image of a familiar object (shovel), recognizable contours of numbers and letters) </li><li>  Subjective contours and areas perceived as three-dimensional. </li><li>  Color contours (or rather the area around the border of the color contour) with the maximum perception power. </li><li>  Complex contours consisting of a set of well-distinguishable segments. </li></ol><br>  It should be understood that in the case of the presence of several different-type contours in the visibility zone, the eye will first be allocated the stronger of them, and upon repeated, deeper consideration, the weaker ones.  Thus, the <b>"force of attraction" of the region for the eyes is a composition of the strength of all distinguishable contours, taken in proportion to their importance</b> . <br><br>  The size of the contour of the center of attention should not exceed the optical angle of view of the eye (a contour visible by peripheral vision is perceived less strongly due to the resolution of the eye) provided that the center is in the zone of maximum visual acuity.  On the other hand, the contour must be clearly visible with lateral vision.  Thus, the <b>dimensions of the contour near the center of attention should not be less than 5 and no more than 11 degrees, while in the formation of the contour take curves with a length of at least 10 angular minutes</b> . <br><br>  <b>The centers of attention should be located in such a way that the distance between them is not less than 17 and not more than 35 degrees.</b>  In this case, when the center of attention is surveyed, a second center of attention will be captured by peripheral vision and a reflex saccade will be performed on it. <br><br><h2>  Zones of indistinguishability </h2><br><br>  As a result of the appearance of the trap phenomenon for the gaze, the <b>phenomenon of indistinguishability zones</b> also appears <b>- regions of the image that subjectively repulse the gaze</b> .  Indistinguishability zones are formed between the centers of attention at the point of their ‚Äúbalance‚Äù.  <b>Parts of the contour and objects that fall into the zone of indistinguishability are observed only by peripheral vision, which has a weak resolution and attention is not focused on them.</b> <br><br>  It is with this effect that the fact that when reading long words to the eye, it is necessary to precisely distinguish the letters of the beginning of the word, the symbols of the end and the general contours (length) of the components is connected.  A side <b>psychological effect is that objects in areas of indistinguishability are usually not remembered by consciousness</b> . <br><br>  However, not everything is so bad: it is worth destroying the eye catcher, for example, by covering one of the spotlights with your palm, as if, by magic, objects of the indistinguishable zone become more pronounced. <br><br>  <sup><a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/57679/">1 Excursion in the eye</a> - <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/57681/">2 Perception</a> - <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/57682/">3 Geometry of view</a> - <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/57683/">4 Eye tracking</a> - <b>5 How to catch the eye</b> - <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/57685/">6 Simulation of eye tracking</a></sup> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/57684/">https://habr.com/ru/post/57684/</a></p>
