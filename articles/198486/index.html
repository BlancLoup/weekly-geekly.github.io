Yes - pi $ u, which we ourselves have allowed.  We were all afraid of him, but as always he came. <br>  And control of the Internet (oh, what a surprise) is a tasty morsel for power. <br><br>  And then a bunch of comments in articles about all this, but "What to do" and "How to be" are usually limited to "VPN", "VDS + VPN", "I2P".

      In general, there is only one option - to try to anonymize. <br>  In all possible ways, for, I am afraid that they will cover the VPN and others like it unequivocally. <br><br>  But it is necessary to start something from something - I2P and MESH are not yet a way out - the resources are there - the cat is crying.  For now, anyway.  Although to get information about them and see what's there is interesting. <br><br>  Now is the time until the summer of 2014 (before the launch of SORM of the next generation with the possibility of a 12 hour cache), but it drastically decreases with each passing day. <br><br>  I have tried at the moment to understand how you can at least start to start a VPN, based on 5 Mbps speed, and a couple of torrents per month + permanent web and near-traffic traffic (by load) at the best price.  "Modestly, but anonymously and cheaply." <br><br>  Services with our gentlemen dismissed immediately.  I do not know, I do not trust - maybe I'm wrong - correct me, if so. <br><br>  Having looked Q &amp; A on Habr <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/qa/24663/">here</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/qa/4769/">here</a> , looked that who offers, decided to begin with <br>  "KEBRUM" and "StrongVPN" - they are often mentioned in the Habr√©. <br><br>  In Kebrum, they never answered me, but in StrongVPN I had a long conversation with the account manager, then with the technical specialist, for which I thank them so much.  I hope it will be you Interssen. <br><br>  The Special Offer for $ 55-85 depends on the availability of OpenVPN at the prices now - I understood that way, because in their tariffs the features of the leg are not something to break, but it will break what even the bones do not have ... <br>  For these banknotes you get a more or less stable connection and the ability to change the IP / SERVER on average every two days per month. <br><br>  Everything seems to be nothing, but there is a spoon of shit that makes a barrel of shit out of a barrel of honey + 1 spoon. <br><br>  In short, you can say this - StrongVPN is located in the United States, with all the ensuing problems. <br><br>  For banyat torrents.  Ban ak with the retention on it the entire amount.  Not always, not immediately (at first warnings on soap) but still. <br>  Because the proprietor of the gang is burning peers in torrents, watching IP, and if the IP belongs to a company in the territory of their country, then they write slander to them and to them. <br><br>  Strong in this case, you have to cancel the acc. <br>  And this is only one way of pressure.  Otherwise, everything seems more or less tolerable.  But this is more or less annoying - I don‚Äôt want to pay money for semi-anonymity (that is, to download something from my white IP). <br><br>  In general, StrongVPN for me is not an option, albeit the most powerful and largest. <br><br>  I have several other options - I will try to clarify later - my comrades checked - the situation is almost the same (EU). <br><br>  In general, I ask for help from the habr-community - the trouble is common and time is less and less - someone can do it well in this market, knows what offers are good or checked them for yourself - I beg you to comment in the comments. <br><br>  Because it is vital. <br>  Because ‚ÄúI have nothing to hide‚Äù is not an excuse, I don‚Äôt want my attendance passwords to be easily received, what I‚Äôm interested in, etc., I don‚Äôt want my letters to be read with anyone, I don‚Äôt want my big brother to follow damn me!  for my money, I am an adult, and in the end I have the right to confidentiality, as our constitution asserts. <br><br>  And in general it is not good to bury a head in the sand with a bare ass - it may be inconvenient then to be in front of friends. <br><br>  And all this would be funny if it were not so sad. <br><br>  <b>And let's do something, at least to share with each other useful information, and not to discuss the kings and their jungle.</b>  <b>What are we techies if we can not think of something and find the best solution?</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Not the first time! <br>  Let's think about real solutions to this problem. <br><br>  I‚Äôm really looking forward to a constructive comment, thanks for the time spent on my thoughts and I hope that all this is not in vain. <br><br>  PS If you answer from Kebrum - accomplish your goal in the comments. <br><br>  PPS Options like Amazon (and, I think, all other Clouds-services) - all the same + more stringent rules (for not for the purpose of these services) - I had the honor to talk with those specialists from Amazon. <br><br>  PPPS <b>NDA ... I did not expect that everything would be so inconsistent, apparently the saying about a roasted rooster is still fair - until a wave of arrests and sanctions rolls - no one will lift a finger.</b>  <b>It is a pity - then - it will be quite late already.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Those.</b>  <b>we are few + we are inactive.</b> <b><br><br></b>  <b>People like this?</b>  <b>This is YOUR freedom!</b>  <b>And instead of this, you are spreading pretentious conversations, saying that hiding is not our business, unlicensed content is not good - where is all this?</b> <b><br></b>  <b>On you start to go, and you calmly carry.</b> <br><br>  <b>The options proposed in the comments:</b> <br>  <a href="http://proxy.sh/about">proxy.sh/about</a> - proxy (thanks to MazaFakagro) <br>  <a href="https://put.io/">https://put.io</a> Service downloads a torrent to the cloud, and then the ability to carry it off via https (thanks to vitalyk) <br>  <a href="https://webcare360.com/">https://webcare360.com</a> DMCA-Free zone with server purchase there (thanks ZonD80) <br>  <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/which-vpn-providers-really-take-anonymity-seriously-111007/%3F">here</a> and <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/vpn-services-that-take-your-anonymity-seriously-2013-edition-130302/">here</a> VPN reviews from torrentsfreak (thanks to eldren) <br>  Hide My Ass (thanks birukoff) <br>  Build your intranet ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/198486/">here</a> ) - why not <br>  <a href="http://www.ibvpn.com/">http://www.ibvpn.com</a> more loyal to VPN torrents (thanks to skeeet) <br>  Sekurnye messengers <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/198486/">here</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/198486/">here</a> and <a href="http://tox.im/">here</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/198486/">https://habr.com/ru/post/198486/</a></p>
