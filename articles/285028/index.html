The most common answer is: to make money.  This is the right answer, but not complete.  To live, a person needs to eat, drink, breathe and fulfill other natural needs.  Without food, you can stretch for a while, without water - less, without air - just a little.  Companies in this regard are like people, money - their food, water and air.  Without them, they die.  But just as few people see their mission only in eating more eagerly, so few of which the company sets as its main goal to earn more.  But just as most people have to earn their own bread by sweating their heads, having forgotten about their highest purpose, so many companies concentrate on earnings, forgetting what they call the fashionable word ‚Äúmission‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To live well, the company can go two ways: earn more or spend less.  Better - both.  But with the first paragraph, many problems, respectively, the second path often becomes the only one.  What is the main cost item for any company?  The answer is known - the wage fund.  Here we will talk further about how to reduce it, preferably so that the wolves are fed and the sheep are safe.  To whom you identify yourself as a wolf or a sheep, everyone decides for himself, just not to forget that at any moment the situation may change by 180 degrees. <br><br><h1>  Team building </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/61c7c838/2e7e47d4/e04d324f/553556fa.png">

      Often called "debilingom".  Why so rude?  Because team building seems like a very simple event, and everyone thinks he is an expert.  To the contrary, his organization is often entrusted to anyone; the marketing department is not the worst option; the director‚Äôs secretary may turn up. <br><br>  But let's assume that the company conducted it correctly.  What is the benefit for the company?  Obviously, the establishment of informal relations between the management team, subordinate and various (sometimes hostile) units.  It is much harder to refuse the person with whom he shared the table, shelter and pulled the rope in one team, in a request that goes beyond direct duties and requires to stay at work for a couple of hours.  The second plus is a change of environment and, in fact, a forced rest, both from work and from a beloved wife, a dog and a canary: loyalty to the company is increasing.  Third: under the influence of alcohol or simply in a relaxed state, ingenious ideas can be born in the minds of employees, which in a sober way, they would never have voiced, and moreover they would not have agreed with other departments of the company.  It rarely happens, but it's worth it. <br><br>  Having built causal relationships, we see a direct expression in money: loyal employees - less personnel turnover, and, accordingly, lower costs for finding and training personnel;  employees start working more, both qualitatively and quantitatively, for the same salary;  business processes that have changed from the bottom can in the long run save, or even bring, companies substantial sums. <br><br>  When team building turns into debiling, everything can have the exact opposite effect. <br><br><h1>  Social package </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/03d45d1c/38278438/cbd642f9/590cf3f2.png"><br><br>  Voluntary medical insurance, fitness center, partial or full payment of travel to the place of vacation, corporate car and other benefits paid by the company. <br><br>  Here you have to do a little accounting.  On the one hand, an employee can buy all this himself, but then he needs an appropriate salary.  On the other hand, companies with the lion's share of the money required for the social package, in its absence, will have to part in various taxes.  The company can at the expense of bulk discounts to buy all of the above is much cheaper than an individual.  Accordingly, the amount spent on the social package is much less than the amount by which it would be necessary to increase the salary for the employees to buy all this themselves.  Well, for any sane manager, the answer to the question of giving money to the state in the form of taxes, or to its own employees in the form of a social package, is obvious. <br><br>  A common mistake that both companies and employees make is that companies do not talk about the market value of a social package, but employees do not consider it and focus only on the average market rate in their specialty, considering the proposals of competitors. <br><br><h1>  Mission, Vision and Corporate Values </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/efaf498a/77fd6b2e/1c88cac4/84d476db.png"><br><br>  It would seem - just fashionable, advertised by business consultants.  But not everything is so straightforward.  With the right approach, these concepts can reduce the cost of finding personnel, their loyalty and administrative costs (management costs).  All these three concepts are present in any company, but not all of them are formulated. <br><br>  Now more. <br><br>  Personnel staff will not have to screen out at interviews people inappropriate to corporate values, a much smaller number of such personnel will send a resume.  A smaller amount will be dismissed (independently or forcibly) on probation, due to inconsistencies with the company's global views. <br><br>  It is much more pleasant to work in an organization whose position corresponds to your life priorities.  I do not want to consider the proposals of competitors, even with a higher salary, but with incomprehensible views on life. <br><br>  Fewer approvals and bureaucracy slowing down processes.  Many questions to do or not do something will be resolved based on the company's mission and its values.  For example, if quality is important for a company, the manager will not need to make a decision in agony and coordination about a project where speed is important and quality cannot be ensured.  Also, many questions will not bother ordinary employees: the answers to them will be known. <br><br><h1>  And lastly </h1><br><br>  If suddenly you happen to work in a company where all of the above is successfully applied, do not forget that the management does this not out of philanthropy, but to increase profits.  If suddenly you manage a company and want to reduce costs by similar methods, do not forget that you will apply all this to specific living people and God forbid, they will suspect a falsehood in your actions. <br><br>  In general, all this is just a terrible tale. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285028/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285028/</a></p>
