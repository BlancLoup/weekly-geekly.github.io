  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Dive into the Depth: how to fit reality into a small box</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello!  This is the second article in which I would like to tell in more detail and show our view on the process of creating the game, what we are doing now.  So ... Immersion continues ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a09/110/a83/a09110a835574e5fb1db3ba2634748eb.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And I would like to start with the basics, as you know, the foundation is the most important thing in building a house.  So relax from the code while we are focusing on the drawings and plans for the future structure :) <br><br>  The foundation of the project that we are doing is to create a certain ‚ÄúDatabase of Views‚Äù, as I call it, or if it is simpler, then a database of objects and interactions between them. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      From my point of view, it is logical to begin with this, but so far, with the exception of a few projects, no one is trying to do it, as deep as we want.  And we want, roughly speaking, to transfer a database of images, objects and interactions from our reality into that very small box called a computer.  Sounds schizophrenic?  Yes, it is only at first glance!  :) <br><br>  Thoughts about the impossibility of implementing such a large-scale project, in fact lie in the limitations of our thinking, fear of starting to do something that no one else has done and a little bit in the limitations of the available computer resources at the moment, the last, fortunately, is solved. <br><br>  To those who immediately reject at the root the possibility of implementing such a project, I would suggest reading further just like a fairy tale, there everything is possible.  The rest I suggest to delve into the pictures as deeply as possible, because in our opinion, we as humans, or rather, our brain is exactly the way it is, as we are trying to do, and the reality is drawn on the basis of the constantly updated database of images, logical chains and ideas about everything around that we managed to accumulate and unpack, turning these ideas into "our own experience."  And, accordingly, if we want to make such a digitized copy of the device of our reality inside a computer (as far as possible), we need to build on how we work, and for this we will have to dig a little deeper than usual. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eb0/98f/6a4/eb098f6a4cdd48d785527efb2d263a5d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The image represents, only very approximately, a separate composite object in the database and a multitude of direct and indirect interactions formed between the objects. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b08/4ad/20a/b084ad20ad014aa69b6641413c41da04.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As the database of objects and interactions is filled, configurations that are similar by certain criteria form certain ‚Äúconglomerates,‚Äù so that fish living in water and dew drops formed during the process of condensation of water vapor form a conglomerate: Water element.  This is all just for an example, well, a little for reflection. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2d0/083/0cb/2d00830cb2854e00be1fe2800c3f6b95.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Then we will talk about why such a database of objects and their interactions is compiled, and how to work with it all. <br><br>  In general, the database itself is an ‚Äúarray of arrays in an array,‚Äù and globally, so far divided into two areas: <br><br>  1) Objects; <br>  2) Actions. <br><br>  Or you can still say - on nouns and verbs - the one who does and on the process that is being performed. <br><br>  As I said, all the subjects of the database are of a composite nature, i.e.  Despite all the complexity and illusory integrity, they can be broken down into smaller components (with the exception of some of the most fundamental manifestations, beyond which we are not going to go), and in this ‚Äúcollapsible‚Äù form, it is much easier to present and implement them.  Thus, the compound object ‚ÄúFruit Salad‚Äù can be represented as a collection consisting of an apple, a banana, an orange, cream and a plate in which the product is prepared, and then, using a certain predetermined algorithm, make a salad out of it.  Yet it is easier than trying in some way to model a salad without delving into the ingredients it contains.  Yet the global idea is that the user will be able to take a spoon and try this virtual salad, and for this you need to "describe" each object and all its possible connections with other objects of this virtual reality database ... It is difficult, long, but possible. <br><br><h3>  About birds </h3><br>  Further, for example, I randomly took the direction of the implementation algorithms for the flight of the bird, so let's talk about it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/28b/cf5/49e/28bcf549e6c44169a344ed6a183cc981.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The action differs from the compound object in that its manifestation, unlike the possibility of the manifestation of a separate object, is not possible, because, as they say, there is nothing to talk about.  Well, the flight, yes the flight and what's next ... While there is no one who flies - there is no action, there is no one to commit them.  And as soon as some ‚Äúnoun‚Äù appears, - so it immediately tries to do something, and even acquire a bunch of epithets along the way - what a beautiful flight, the sky is blue and the sun is clear ... <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fc0/346/d8b/fc0346d8bd1a4e848af5280537069033.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Finally, I left the most interesting, - this is how we will work with this constantly updated database of objects and interactions, this is what we affectionately call "4D Programming."  We want to realize that feeling when an unconscious computer begins to understand you from a half-word ... As far as its "learning", i.e.  replenish and update the database, analyzing the user's request-request, isolating objects, parts and actions between them from it, substituting and matching the right one from its base, to execute the desired algorithm by the user. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/013/1f0/fe6/0131f0fe61364f2cab3bd3ab7116781a.jpg" alt="image"><br>  In the next part I will continue the story, I plan to make an even deeper cut in the details of the project.  Thank you for your attention and everything will turn out! <br><br><hr><br>  First introductory part: <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/320168/">Immersion in Depth: how to make a quality project without millions in your pocket and why you shouldn‚Äôt be afraid of ‚Äúlong-term construction projects‚Äù</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/320564/">https://habr.com/ru/post/320564/</a></p>
