  <section class="page js-page"><h1>iDispenser and MacDispenser - distribution of promotional codes on Twitter</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good afternoon, dear readers, I present to your attention a new service <a href="https://twitter.com/iDispenser">iDispenser</a> .  It is designed for two types of clients: for <i>iOS</i> and <i>OS X</i> users, and for software developers for these operating systems.  Users will be able to get free promotional codes to download applications from the <i>App Store</i> and <s><i>Mac App Store</i></s> .  And developers will be able to get rid of the extra codes, stray in their accounts.  All you need is to subscribe to the <a href="https://twitter.com/iDispenser">iDispenser</a> bot on Twitter and wait for the promo code in a personal message.  Or vice versa, send him the promotional codes for organizing their distribution to random subscribers. <br><br>  One comment made me think of dividing the service into two: <a href="https://twitter.com/iDispenser">iDispenser</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/MacDispenser">MacDispenser</a> .  One for the <i>App Store</i> promo codes, the other for the <i>Mac App Store</i> , respectively.  Subscribe, I hope you enjoy! <br><br> <a href="https://twitter.com/iDispenser"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/825/cd8/016/825cd8016ae0fa7999dbcbc2f4434844.png"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Why do users need it? </h4><br>  Users subscribe to the <i>iDispenser</i> bot and sooner or later receive promotional codes through private messages on <i>Twitter</i> .  In addition to the code, users receive a link to the sender of the promotional code.  They can use the received code themselves or give it to one of their friends or exchange them, there are many options.  Isn't it nice to get something for free?  Do not like it - give it back in the end :)

      You can get two types of codes, here are their examples: <b>NAP44AT6F6KT</b> and <b><a href="http://tokn.co/0dhpqdzy">http://tokn.co/0dhpqdzy</a></b> <b>Promo</b> codes of the first type are called REDEEM codes, they need to be copied and entered into the App Store in the REPEAT field ( <i>REDEEM</i> ).  Codes of the second type are called tokens (eng. <i>Tokens</i> ) for their use, it is enough to follow the link, there you can also learn about the application / game before redeeming the code.  Token type codes are checked before being sent to the user and only unexpired and unused codes are <i>delivered, redeem</i> type <i>codes</i> are not checked.  In case of receiving non-working codes, complain about the authors of invalid codes - there is a button in the Twi to complain, here we are complaining. <br><br><h4>  Why do developers need it? </h4><br>  Developers subscribe to the iDispenser bot as users and when they have a desire to send promotional codes - send a personal message to <i>iDispenser</i> with the available codes.  Currently, two types of codes are supported: the original user codes and the <i>Tokens</i> application codes ( <a href="http://usetokens.com/">usetokens.com</a> ).  The original codes are not checked in any way, the <i>Tokens</i> codes are checked for expiration date and validity.  If the code has expired, or it has been used - the author of the code is notified of this by a personal message.  The validity of the usual text codes does not give in to verification - therefore I will ask the developers to monitor them more carefully.  In the case of a large number of complaints on non-working codes, you will have to abandon them in favor of <i>Tokens</i> . <br><br>  Far from all developers, codes are snapped up, often your promotional codes are not needed by anyone.  Nobody will simply promote you for nothing.  And promotional codes are dozens, and what's even worse - they burn.  For each version of the application / game is given a few dozen promotional codes.  Before updating the version, <i>merge the</i> promotional codes in <i>iDispenser</i> - they will be valid for a few more weeks, and you will already receive your new codes.  Let your promotional codes work for you!  You will get new users and their recommendations to friends and acquaintances, this is better than nothing. <br><br><h4>  Something about the work of the service </h4><br>  Every time the service gives someone a promotional code: <br><ul><li>  informs the author of the promotional codes to whom the code was given; </li><li>  informs recipients of promotional codes from whom these promotional codes were received; </li></ul><br>  <i>iDispenser</i> counts the number of its followers and: <br><ul><li>  welcomes 100 first followers in their feed; </li><li>  welcomes every 100th follower in his feed, expressing his respect; </li></ul><br>  <i>Honestly, it's not a follower number, but the number of someone iDispenser fouls in response.</i> <br><br><h4>  What do I get from this service? </h4><br>  At least I will distribute my promotional codes, but in general I was very surprised by the absence of such a service (Google a half hour and found nothing similar).  In general, I am the first and active user of the service. <br><br>  <b>PS The</b> service starts as soon as there are at least several hundred subscribers.  Habr, click on it :) Now the script runs every 15 minutes, welcomes subscribers and starts sending promotional codes when the number of readers exceeds the constant (I will change it today, maybe 100, maybe 500).  I hope a few hundred subscribers will not break my script and will not lead it to <b>Rate Limited Exceeded</b> :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/174227/">https://habr.com/ru/post/174227/</a></p>
