I really liked the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe ‚ÄúI Migrate‚Äù blog, so I decided to join in and tell about how wonderful life is in our brotherly country Belarus. <br><br>  I myself lived until 22 years in Moscow, was engaged in php-programming and seo.  A year and a half ago, I was bored with living in an overpopulated city with a fast paced life, and I left friends and relatives moved to the near abroad, but such a distant foreign country, the Republic of Belarus.  Now I live in the suburbs of Minsk, I work in a large, bright office with a view of the Svisloch River, in the company of enthusiastic enthusiastic professionals publishing web-based themed social Internet projects.  I am sure that every visitor to the Habrahabr site is dreaming about this. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><h4>  Moving </h4><br>  To cross the border with Belarus does not require a special visa or permit.  A citizen of Russia is free to live and work in Belarus, freely apply for admission to higher educational institutions, and acquire ownership of real estate.  Such preferences for the Russians were obtained as a result of the conclusion of the Union Treaty between Russia and Belarus, wisely signed by our government.

      In Belarus, at first, you will feel ill at ease, as if getting into a fairy-tale magical world, where everything is arranged perfectly.  But having survived the culture shock and having adapted, you most likely do not want to return after that to Russia, I assert this from my own experience and the experience of several of my friends. <br><br><h4>  Job </h4><img src="http://img216.imageshack.us/img216/5295/48522056.jpg" alt="image" align="right"><br>  Belarus is experiencing a boom of information technology, therefore, IT personnel is constantly needed here.  The largest employers in Belarus are EPAM, Itransition, Integral, IBA, Belhard, but there are also thousands of small companies that successfully compete with the giants in the job market. <br><br>  Finding a job is easy, for example, in Minsk, employers place their stands right at the station, inviting newly arrived Russian citizens to have an interview. <br><br>  Salaries in the field of IT in Belarus are comparable to those in Moscow, but renting housing and food is much cheaper here. <br><br><h4>  A life </h4><img src="http://img216.imageshack.us/img216/3227/16139502.jpg" alt="image" align="right"><br>  I settled in the capital of Belarus, Minsk, although there are IT vacancies everywhere, even in agro-towns, as the rural villages here are called. <br><br>  The economy of Belarus is growing rapidly, despite the crisis.  This is especially noticeable again in the state of affairs in the field of information technology.  Everywhere where people live, as a rule, one can find a free wi-fi access point, organized by the monopolist company Beletelecom.  There are other Internet providers in Belarus, but they only resell the services of Beltelecom, naturally overestimating the price and reducing the quality. <br><br>  The transport system in the republic is organized very conveniently, you can easily move between cities on high-speed shuttle buses, there are buses, trolleybuses and trams inside the cities, there is a metro in Minsk. <br><br>  Transport, utilities, medicine, food - all this is subsidized by the state, and therefore everything is very, very cheap. <br><br>  In Belarus, there is a struggle against drunkenness, as part of this case special events are being held, called ‚Äúdays of sobriety‚Äù.  On such days, the sale of alcoholic beverages is prohibited in stores; instead, each customer receives two packages of kefir for free. <br><br>  Drugs in Belarus are legally prohibited, but in practice any policeman will gladly tell you where to buy soft drugs illegally. <br><br>  Rest takes a special place in the life of the inhabitants of Belarus.  At the service of citizens and guests of the republic, casinos, ski resorts, ice arenas, variety shows are open day and night.  Particular attention is paid to sport, not without reason, most recently Belarus was chosen to host the 2014 World Hockey Championship. <br><br>  In this regard, Minsk looks like an attractive tourist center for Muscovites, besides, it can be reached by train in just one night (I got on the train in the evening and in Minsk in the morning). <br><br><h4>  Society </h4><img src="http://img218.imageshack.us/img218/5126/10619437.jpg" alt="image" align="right"><br>  Residents of Belarus are usually peaceful and friendly.  They treat foreigners with great interest and curiosity, especially from Russia, because many Belarusians still learn and understand Russian speech. <br><br>  Most residents speak Belarusian;  The Russian language, despite the status of the state, is practically driven out of use.  However, do not despair, because many citizens speak good English, at least you can easily explain it to the waiter or conductor of the trolleybus. <br><br>  President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko is revered as a deity in Belarus, which is not surprising, since his rule is linked to economic growth after years of poverty, strengthening sovereignty, the development of civil society and information technology.  At the same time, it‚Äôs not accepted to show your deepest respect to the ruler in Belarus, so if you try to make a speech about it, the interlocutor will most likely ignore your cue or embarrassedly change the subject. <br><img src="http://img216.imageshack.us/img216/9306/90068233.jpg" alt="image" align="right"><br>  In Belarus, the cult of purity is widely developed.  Leaving trash on the streets is considered the greatest crime.  There is a case when a bus ticket for a bus dropped on the street was put in jail for 15 days.  In this regard, Belarus has much in common with Singapore. <br><br>  The seemingly related kinship between Russians and Belarusians is in fact deceptive, because Belarusian culture is strongly influenced by Buddhism (it was introduced and widely spread in Belarus in the 15th century, under the auspices of the legendary Prince Vitovt).  This explains the presence of such features in the character of the Belarusians as modesty and tolerance. <br><br><h4>  Total </h4><br>  Of course, Belarus is not as exotic as Thailand or New Zealand, but there is everything you need for life.  So, the choice is yours! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/59908/">https://habr.com/ru/post/59908/</a></p>
