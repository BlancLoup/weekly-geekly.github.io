The desire to go somewhere, no matter where - a completely normal desire for a person.  Traction to the unknown, the desire to visit other lands accompanied mankind throughout history.  That is why many people want to fly to distant lands. <br><br>  Someone moves to another street, someone dares to go to another city.  Even emigrate to another country.  Travelers, scientists and trackers explored the Earth far and wide, climbed into the deepest depths and rose high into the atmosphere.  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA_%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2_%25E2%2580%2594_%25D1%2583%25D1%2587%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2_%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D1%2585_%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D1%2585_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%2591%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2">546 people from 37 countries</a> visited Earth orbit.  Where should we go next?  What to research? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Everyone is talking about a colony on Mars.  Of course, it will inevitably appear in a few decades.  But the mass resettlement of colonists to the Red Planet will happen, nevertheless, in a more distant future.  Probably, this possibility will appear in our children and grandchildren (or in the children of our friends, if we do not leave offspring).

      Where to go adventurers now?  Is there a chance for a simple guy from the backwoods to fly away from the planet Earth?  Now it is. <br><br>  Welcome to the <a href="http://asgardia.space/">space country Asgardia</a> !  This is the first nation in the world, which is going to establish an independent state in space - in Earth orbit. <br><br>  The name "Asgardia" comes from the name of the fictional <a href="http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Asgard_(City)">city ‚Äã‚Äãof Asgard</a> , the capital of one of the <a href="http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Nine_Realms">Nine Worlds</a> in Asgardian mythology.  As is known from myths, after the fall of Asgard, Tony Stark proposed to rebuild the city with the help of a new repulsor-technology based on anti-gravity.  The reborn and modernized city was called <a href="http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Asgardia">Asgardia</a> .  A real symbiosis of technology and magic existed under the wise rule of the goddess <a href="http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/All-Mother_of_Asgardia_(Earth-616)">Mother of everything</a> , in the presence of the Father of all, <a href="http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Odin_Borson_(Earth-616)">Odin</a> , in self-imposed exile. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/694/c16/25b/694c1625b3b24135809640ff03259c87.jpg"><br>  <i>Mythological Asgardia</i> <br><br>  Asgardia hovered above the Earth in the same place where Asgard was located when he was brought to our planet, but later Mother of all decided to leave Earth in order to better control the inhabitants of Asgardia.  Then the city flew into lunar orbit, and then completely moved to the orbit of Saturn. <br><br>  Hopefully, the fate of the mythical city will not befall the real Asgardy - a small colony of earthlings, which is planned to be based on a satellite in near-Earth space. <br><br>  The idea belongs to the well-known scientist, scientific director of KB-1, Chairman of the Presidium of the Independent Expert Council on the problems of aerospace defense of the Russian Federation, a member of the Academy of Military Sciences of the Russian Federation, Doctor of Technical Sciences <a href="http://www.ashurbeyli.ru/">Igor Raufovich Ashurbeyli</a> .  A talented scientist and industrialist for ten years headed the NGO "Almaz" them.  Academician A.A.  Raspletina (now the Almaz-Antey State Medical Hospital) - and helped to bring him to the leadership of the military-technical complex of Russia.  He is the general designer of the Russian ZRK S-400 Triumph and the S-500 ZRK, the founder of the <a href="http://airc.at/">International Aerospace Research Center</a> , and the chairman of the UNESCO international space commission.  Now Igor Raufovich has a new, no less interesting task. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/12b/e42/cd4/12be42cd452a48de904b7a1d851d7bd8.jpg"><br>  <i>Igor Ashurbeyli at a press conference in Paris, October 12, 2016</i> <br><br>  The first official press conference of Asgardia was held yesterday in Paris.  The launch of the inhabited satellite Asgardia was <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/asgardia-space-nation-law-2016-10">supported by scientists and experts</a> from the USA, Canada and Romania.  The project is supported by <a href="http://report.rice.edu/sir/faculty.detail%3Fp%3D3A13D9FC465BDF33">David Alexander</a> , Director of the <a href="http://rsi.rice.edu/en/">Rice Space Institute</a> , Dean of the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Rice University;  Professor <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/law/about/profs/jakhu-ram">Ram Yakhuh</a> , Director of the <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/iasl/">Center for the Study of Air and Space Law</a> at McGill University (Canada);  <a href="http://www.clarkefoundation.org/about-us/leadership/dr-joseph-n-pelton-vice-chairman/">Joseph Pelton</a> , Director of the Space and Advanced Communications Research Institute (SACRI) at George Washington University (USA) and the Romanian cosmonaut <a href="http://www.esa.int/About_Us/Welcome_to_ESA/ESA_history/50_years_of_humans_in_space/Dumitru_Dorin_Prunariu">Dumitru-Dorin Prunariu</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/511/ffe/5a7/511ffe5a70864aac886c5bd05389e4b0.jpg"><br>  <i>Joseph Pelton at the press conference of Asgardia in Paris, October 12, 2016</i> <br><br>  Behind the project are serious people, this is not some kind of visionary businessman.  Yes, and plans to establish a colony of people on the satellite look a hundred times more real than the plan for landing a million colonists on Mars.  So this project is quite able to divert public attention from SpaceX's ambitious initiatives. <br><br>  "I think settling on Asgardia would be a less risky idea than flying to Mars," <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/asgardia-space-nation-law-2016-10">said</a> Timothy West, a spokesman for the organization.  ‚ÄúAnd it will be easier for you to return to Earth if you don‚Äôt like it there.‚Äù <br><br>  The sources of funding for the organization are unknown, but the representative of Asgardia <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/asgardia-space-nation-law-2016-10">said</a> that Igor Ashurbeyli provided the initial budget, so there is no doubt about the initial task of launching the first satellite of Asgardia within 18 months. <br><br>  How much is needed for the actual construction of the station in orbit is unknown.  For comparison, the construction of the ISS has cost more than $ 100 billion. The founding fathers of the new nation have not yet disclosed the technical details of the construction of the space station.  But it is planned that Asgardia will not only be home to many earthlings, but will also protect the planet from dangerous meteorites, space debris and other threats with the help of the <a href="https://room.eu.com/community/igor-ashurbeyli-proposes-armed-space-platform-to-defend-planet-earth-urbocop">URBOCOP</a> platform (also the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãIgor Ashurbeyli).  Residents of Asgardia hope to earn money on the extraction of minerals from asteroids. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cc3/849/e7e/cc3849e7e8374770ba6424a552ec44e4.jpg"><br>  <i>Slide from the <a href="https://room.eu.com/images/community/Montreal-McGill-Presentation-Ashurbeyli.pdf">presentation of</a> Igor Ashurbayli on the platform URBOCOP</i> <br><br>  Registration in citizens of Asgardia has already begun on the official website.  By this time, 69,576 people have applied for registration - and this is just a day after the press conference.  Call for applications is available for the first 100,000 people.  Judging by the rate of registration, all places will be occupied over the next day. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/823/06c/c99/82306cc99a664dd4a922ebf18e117fab.jpg"><br><br>  The first satellite Asgardia plans to launch in 2017 or 2018 (ideally on the historic day <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BF%25D1%2583%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA-1">of October 4,</a> 2017).  First, it will be an unmanned robotic satellite, followed by a large station that will take on permanent residents.  In the future, Asgardia has ambitions to join the UN and participate in the discussion of earth policy on a par with other states. <br><br>  PS If you do not have enough space in the first batch for Asgardia, for citizenship issues, contact <i>citizens@asgardia.space</i> . <br><br><blockquote>  <a href="http://asgardia.space/contest/flag">Flag contest</a> <br>  <a href="http://asgardia.space/contest/insignia">Logo Contest</a> <br>  <a href="http://asgardia.space/contest/anthem">Anthem competition</a> </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/398241/">https://habr.com/ru/post/398241/</a></p>
