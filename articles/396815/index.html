Attendance of the same "Rutreker" after blocking almost did not decrease.  Russian right holders have complained to the government about this fact - and the state is preparing new repressive measures that should hit the pirated sites. <br><br>  The Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation has <a href="http://regulation.gov.ru/projects/List/AdvancedSearch">prepared a bill</a> to tighten anti-piracy legislation.  On the official website of regulation.gov.ru, only a <a href="http://regulation.gov.ru/projects/List/AdvancedSearch">notice</a> has been published so far, but Gazeta.ru and some media have <a href="http://www.gazeta.ru/business/2016/08/11/10119827.shtml">read the full text of the</a> proposals sent by the right holders to the Ministry of Culture. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Previously, the Ministry of Communications was engaged in the preparation of anti-piracy legislation, but now the Ministry of Culture has undertaken this work.  According to Gazety.ru, the adoption of new repressive measures against ‚Äúpirated‚Äù websites was initiated by First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov after meeting with representatives of the Russian film industry.  They complained that the industry has little money.  They need to make money on renting movies and realizing rights, but this is not possible because of the presence of illegal distribution of films and TV shows on the Internet.

      The rightholders asked for measures to be taken and increased pressure on pirated sites, because the official blockade did not work on them.  The Russians still somehow manage to go to these sites and piracy to watch movies and TV shows. <br><br>  If industry offers are accepted, it will be a more serious blow to pirated sites than a formal blocking that is easy to get around.  Rights holders offer the following measures: <br><br><ol><li>  The simplified procedure of permanent blocking for anonymous site owners, which will be faster than the 6-8 months required for a standard blocking through the court.  This measure will be applied to sites that do not contain information about the site owner and the necessary contact information. <br><br></li><li>  The requirement for search engines to remove links to pirated sites, as well as to ensure the priority presentation of links to sites with legal content. <br><br></li><li>  Bringing search engines to liability for intellectual property rights violations. <br><br></li><li>  Recognition of social networks as ‚Äúinformational intermediaries‚Äù, with responsibility for pirated content published by users. <br><br></li><li>  Bringing to administrative responsibility the operators of local communication networks (Internet providers), who offer their users access to file storages with unlicensed content and software. <br><br></li><li>  The recognition of malicious mobile apps that monetize pirated content with ads and subscription fees. <br><br></li><li>  The ban on advertising on the site, blocked by the court, <b>with the establishment of responsibility for the advertiser</b> (such a system is implemented in the UK). <br><br></li><li>  The ban on making payments in favor of individuals or legal entities associated with the distribution of unlicensed content (it is likely that government agencies will maintain an official <b>list of individual pirates</b> ).  These standards should concern the conduct of any payments: SMS, plastic cards (Visa, MasterCard), through payment systems (PayPal, Yandex.Money and others), <s>Bitcoin</s> . </li></ol><br>  In addition to the Internet Video Association, the amendments were developed by the Association of Film and Television Producers, the Producers Guild, the Internet Copyright Association, the National Federation of the Music Industry, and the Non-Profit Partnership of Software Providers. <br><br>  According to the official notification, the planned date of entry into force of amendments to the legislation is January 2017.  A public discussion of the amendments (which are not published) will last until August 18, 2016. <br><br>  Email address for sending your suggestions: aglaya.ali-khusein@mkrf.ru. <br>  Contact phone of the responsible person: 8 (495) 629-7255. <br>  Additional email address: ekaterina.demidova@mkrf.ru. <br><br>  Please send your comments to the specified addresses. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/396815/">https://habr.com/ru/post/396815/</a></p>
