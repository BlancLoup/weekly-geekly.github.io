With <a href="http://shared.menu/">virtual hosting, the</a> situation is even better: at the time of the announcement, there were 48 hosters, currently the number has increased by more than 3 times - to 160.

The project is a catalog of licenses that are associated with hosting.  In all four projects launched on the main page, the user is offered a set of filters for searching and all tariffs are presented in a common grid.  After long discussions about how a project with licenses should be, we assumed that the visitor already knows what license he needs and only helps him with choosing a place to buy (for example, by the payment method hoster accepts).  Thus, the main page of this project displays a list of licenses by which you can search.  When clicking on any of the licenses, the visitor enters the search section for a specific type of license and can find a hosting provider for its purchase.  In our opinion, this approach is more justified than the general list of licenses, since  mixing licenses, for example, server control panels and billing looks illogical.  There are not so many licenses at the moment, but the list will grow in the near future. <br><br>  We are often asked to add one or another foreign hoster and we try to fulfill them, but there was no massive addition of foreign hosters.  From the current moment, the situation is changing dramatically, the active addition of foreign hosters has begun.  Along with this, the opening of English-language projects for searching virtual servers and shared hosting - <a href="http://vds.click/">VDS.click</a> and <a href="http://shared.click/">SHARED.click</a> .  Now these sites are fully consistent with their Russian-speaking ‚Äúcolleagues‚Äù (with the exception of payment methods that are not available to English-speaking visitors), but in the future small localization deviations are planned. <br><br> <a href="http://vds.click/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/af9/fe7/a01/af9fe7a0135f4192acfae660111e16c8.png"></a> <br><br>  Since the directory now contains foreign hosters, two fields for selecting a hoster appeared in the search - the site languages ‚Äã‚Äãand support languages.  Information about languages ‚Äã‚Äãis also available when viewing the pages of all hosters or their rates.  These search options can be useful if a visitor wants to find a hosting provider whose employees speak their native language.  For example, a client from the United States who does not speak Russian can now easily put a tick in English and the offers of hosters whose employees do not speak English will not appear in search results. <br><br> <a href="http://shared.click/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2fd/2aa/37f/2fd2aa37fb114a039409bd0afac2edc9.png"></a> <br><br>  Recently, the https protocol has become more and more common.  The cost of <a href="https.menu/">SSL certificates is</a> not so high, so they are used more and more often, and search engines encourage sites to switch to a secure connection with an increase in search results.  The hoster bills store and process quite valuable information, so the use of the https protocol to connect to the hosters billing can now be considered a prerequisite for a successful hoster.  However, there are still hosters who neglect the security of customer data and do not use https, all client communication and hosting billing occurs without encryption with the risk of intercepting traffic ... In this situation, hackers can access hosting accounts, virtual and dedicated servers and cause significant damage.  Recently, we decided to check who their hosters do not use SSL and got disappointing results - out of 222 hosters of the catalog, 24 have a connection to the billing without encryption.  In our opinion, this figure (more than 10%) is very sad, so for all hosters who do not use the https protocol in billing, we show a notification.  In addition, the transition to the site of such a host will occur through confirmation, the user will be warned that the hoster does not use SSL. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e56/267/7fe/e562677fe3144bd586722b3caeeb65a4.png"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/275907/">https://habr.com/ru/post/275907/</a></p>
