      Over the past year I have been very lucky several times: the SEC &amp; MAS made statements on the ICO;  btc-e covered and tight lid, it should be noted;  the number of scam projects has increased simply exponentially;  and most importantly, people began to realize that the endless growth of assets is an interesting thing, but poorly integrated into reality. <br><br>  Lucky, of course, as a specialist in the first place.  As a p2p enthusiast, too, but this is a method from the back: in a social environment, it acts painfully. <br><br>  <b>The main thing that catches your eye:</b> <br><br><ol><li>  Centralized exchanges, from Wormwood to Kraken and back, are one of the most vulnerable places in the crypto-fiat stream.  Example btc-e - just about that.  However, you can remember <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/190634/">MtGox</a> .  But, if you look into the depths, even if not of centuries, but of years, then it is worthwhile to find an example of <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/180997/">LibertyReserve</a> , in the year of closure of which Bitcoin not for nothing showed its first significant growth, already measured in hundreds of dollars per unit. </li><li>  Not long ago, the Prosecutor's Office (and again in the Northern Capital of the Motherland) immediately blocked <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DS0OiwloLrx0">40 exchange offices</a> , including the aggregators of exchangers.  And this is despite the fact that the Central Bank wants to ‚Äúlead the blockchain of the revolution,‚Äù the Ministry of Finance refused the repressive law on criminal responsibility for spreading information about digital money and its circulation, and the President met with no one, but V. Bouterin to discuss the future and prospects.  Therefore, p2p-internet: <br>  i2p, TOR-network or any other, even deeper - something that will find its niche.  And not only for the dark side. </li><li>  <a href="https://golos.io/bitcoin/%40satoshifund/evolyuciya-satoshi-pie">Satoshi Fund</a> also literally wrote some time ago the following: ‚Äúa substantial part of users are not aware of the risks associated with investing in blockchain assets, and the increased risks of issuing tokens ‚Äî we decided to stop storing user blockchain assets and repurpose from custodian to software maker.  In this connection, having weighed the pros and cons, we decided to liquidate Satoshi Pie ‚Äù.  The main idea is that investment in the p2p format is the future.  And this is exactly the case.  Therefore, analytics services, reputation assessments, <br>  including those based on some <b>smart standards</b> - what will make the market more constructive, understandable and technologically advanced at the same time. </li></ol><br>  <b>In general, centralization is still visible everywhere:</b> <br><br><ol><li>  In outdated financing methods: there are not so many ‚Äúclean‚Äù p2p-ICOs, since a large part is the arrival of various crypto-funds relative to (the crypto-market itself) <br>  players, but not the principle of "with the world on a string"; </li><li>  In discussing the promising idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa DPoS or PoS - although all of this humanity has already passed more than once: centralization through money or through corruption.  But, of course, it is interesting to those who are doing HYIP projects, say, such as EOS or Filecoin; </li><li>  First of all (sorry for the inconsistency) that the crypto-society creates a kind of technological infrastructure based on p2p-principles, but at the same time, the economy and the social processes themselves leave the old laws at the mercy: in this way the digitized Polibius Bank appears, which in general This contradicts the very nature of virtual currencies;  or the same exchangers with commissions of 10-20% or more percent;  forex projects, casinos, etc.  All this - atavism.  But for the time being, few are destined to understand this; </li><li>  In addition, only a few projects (I will talk about them separately) develop such concepts as: ‚Äúdistributed legal entities‚Äù, ‚Äúbusiness process automation based on smart contracts‚Äù, etc.  The majority, even for ICO, are trying to make a legal entity in some ‚Äúchocolate‚Äù jurisdiction: Switzerland or, say, the same States; </li><li>  Finally, among the millions, only a handful of those who, in principle, want to develop p2p: <br>  most follow popular, easy money and impunity. </li></ol><br>  Yes, transitional forms are always inevitable after the revolution (which, of course, happened).  But the future, in my opinion, is for fundamentally different approaches. <br><br>  <b>I will list only the most obvious:</b> <br><br><ol><li>  <b>Smart contracts</b> are good and in their own right, but, first, it is outdated even before it appeared, because the basis of the future is even more <b>abstraction</b> (to understand what I am talking about, you should look at the evolution of languages programming: there is clearly seen a growing departure from the detailed to the general), for example, modeling or design, which involve the description of business and other processes.  What about coding? <br>  I think that he will get robots and AI, if we can separate these concepts, of course.  So that the residents of Habr understand that it is not said for holivar‚Äôs sake, I‚Äôll make a sketch about the fact that in Novosibirsk and Irkutsk there are two groups working under a single management that do just that: and if I approached the process from the point of view of generalization, then they purely utilitarian and at the same time - scientific position.  I hope, somehow I will tell about this interesting project.  Secondly, the emergence of <b>smart standards</b> : today the community is just approaching this.  But without standardization of large pieces of different algorithms to build a truly solid, secure and at the same time flexible system will not work. </li><li>  <b>Decentralized exchanges</b> - the <a href="https://vc.ru/p/reliable-exchange">future</a> : now, for example, you can explore nvo.io, kyber.network, as well as any dex-like ones.  In addition, in the case of modernization, there is a future for the services of the localbitcoins format.  Let's say RuDex is small, but acceptable today. </li><li>  <b>Reputational services at</b> various levels are what the p2p systems lack and what will become their future in the coming years.  In this aspect, the most interesting thing is that global reputation systems do not just not exclude, but, on the contrary, determine the appearance of local ones, since reputation as a certain set of quantitative indicators is, nevertheless, a rather limited phenomenon, while the aggregate of subjective assessments, objective criteria (in the form of etc.), coupled with a unified rating and rating algorithm, is what will give impetus to real p2p systems.  But for this to happen, people need to understand that reputation is the only important money in any social environment. </li><li>  <b>Systems linking the business sector with different blockchains</b> are conceptually different from current systems tied to one of the blockchains, since  risks of harforkov and possible dying systems (because the endless division will inevitably lead to inflation in assets, <br>  which supposedly are not subject to it), a possible ‚Äúvolitional‚Äù solution to change of mining algorithms, as in the case of Ethereum, obsolescence, etc., are inevitable with long-term planning.  In addition, today we see similar enclaves, but so far only in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãreceiving funds, for example, in the same ICO. </li><li>  From narrow niches I am most impressed by the creation of systems with quantum encryption, since  not looking at the existence of a problem since the 1980s, but considering the growth in technology (a good example is cell phones), one might say <br>  that in the next 10-15 years this problem can become very topical: besides, it is worth considering the development itself and the popularity of blockchain systems. </li></ol><br>  Of course, I would also like to consider the ‚Äúblockchain + big data + AI‚Äù bundle, but for now let's leave it to the next step. <br><br>  For those to whom my reasoning seems too abstract, I inform you that they are derived from an analysis of more than 200 white books and concepts of various projects from this sphere, as well as the result of studying a number of existing projects, such as: exchanges, exchangers, closed systems of services on blockchain (like <a href="http://kickico.com/">kickico</a> or <a href="https://golos.io/ico/%40itsynergis/itsynergis-and-icotracking-analiz-coss">COSS</a> ), media platforms (Golos, Decent, etc.) and other projects built using this technology. <br><br>  Certainly, it is difficult to select all the trends, but in my opinion, the indicated ones have all chances to become priorities and thereby generate entire areas that today do not even exist, like, say, modeling as a new stage of coding development, smart standardization as an evolutionary stage of development of smart contracts. <br><br>  For now.  Questions are welcome.  Additions - even more. <br><br>  PS Experience is systematized in the book.  Habru - exclusive.  When you exit - release with <i>additions.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/336284/">https://habr.com/ru/post/336284/</a></p>
