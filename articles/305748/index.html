What for?  Well, it's supposedly cool, sekyurno. </p><br><p>  What is this sekyurnost?  A lot of articles have already been written on this topic, including on Habr√©.  But I would like to add one more. </p><br><h1>  <font color="#9cc2ce">Why decided to write</font> </h1><br><p>  I, in general, is an Android developer by specialty, and I do not really shy about cryptography and information security protocols.  So when I had to deal with this directly, I was a little shocked by the size of the abyss in my theoretical knowledge. </p><br><p>  I began to rummage in different sources, and it turned out that this topic is not so easy to understand, and it‚Äôs not enough just to read a couple of articles on Habr√© or Wiki, and I never met an absolutely exhaustive and understandable source to refer and say, this is the Bible. "  Therefore, it took a lot of time for me to "understand a little".  So, having figured it out, I decided to share it, and write an article for newbies like me, or just for people who are wondering why there is sometimes https rather than http in the URL bar. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  <font color="#9cc2ce">What does a secure communication channel mean?</font> </h1><br><p>  In order for a data channel to be considered secure, 3 basic principles must be followed: </p><br><ul><li>  <strong>Trust (Trust)</strong> - mutual authentication of subscribers when establishing a connection. </li><li>  <strong>Encryption</strong> - protection of messages transmitted through the channel from unauthorized access.  That is, only you and your interlocutor can speak and listen during the dialogue. </li><li>  <strong>Integrity Assurance (Data Integrity)</strong> - confirmation of the integrity of incoming messages through the channel, i.e.  messages can not be subjected to full or partial replacement of information. </li></ul><br><p>  In this article I would like to talk in detail only about the mechanism of Confidence. </p><br><h1>  <font color="#9cc2ce">What does Trust mean?</font> </h1><br><p>  <strong>You can trust your interlocutor only if you know for sure that he is who he claims to be.</strong> <br>  The simplest example - you know the interlocutor personally, more complex - you know someone who personally knows your intended interlocutor and this someone guarantees that the interlocutor can be trusted. </p><br><h2>  <font color="#9cc2ce">Life example</font> </h2><br><p>  Imagine you want to buy an apartment. <br>  To do this, <em>you</em> find a <em>Realtor</em> who sells apartments. <br>  <em>The realtor</em> says that he works with a certain <em>Developer</em> , and offers an apartment from this <em>Developer</em> . <br>  <em>The developer</em> says that the housing he builds will be handed over, and those who paid him the money to the <em>Realtor</em> will receive his ownership, and the legality of the construction and ownership will be secured by the <em>State</em> . <br>  In total, we have 4 subjects <em>you</em> , <em>Realtor</em> , <em>Developer</em> , <em>State</em> . <br>  To ensure that the transaction took place successfully and no one deceived anyone, the <em>State</em> created laws defining documents that guarantee the legality of transactions, and a printing or signature mechanism that guarantees the authenticity of these documents. </p><br><p>  You have examples of these documents and seals, you can take them from the <em>State</em> . <br>  You have the right to demand from the <em>Realtor</em> original construction documents. <br>  <em>The realtor</em> takes the <em>developer's</em> documents, which are backed up with the documents of the <em>State</em> and makes sure that apartments can be sold - they are legal. <br>  <em>The developer</em> , in turn, receives documents from the <em>State</em> . <br>  Those.  now you can safely conduct a dialogue only with the <em>Realtor</em> , based on his documents sealed by the <em>Developer</em> and the <em>State</em> ! </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cbe/2bc/902/cbe2bc902d2440569d5398c858c51098.png"><br><h2>  <font color="#9cc2ce">HTTPS Trust</font> </h2><br><p>  And now we will change the names of the characters from the Life Example. <br>  <em>You</em> = <strong><em>Client (Client)</em></strong> <br>  <em>Realtor</em> = <strong><em>Server (Server)</em></strong> <br>  <em>Developer</em> = <strong><em>Intermediate Certification Authority (Intermediate CA)</em></strong> <br>  <em>State</em> = <strong><em>Main Certification Authority (Root CA)</em></strong> </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d32/fc5/499/d32fc549936c48f8a2a12f156642e32b.png"><br><p>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority"><strong>The main Certification Authority (Root Certificate Authority, CA)</strong></a> is a generally recognized well-known company, which international organizations have given authority to manage certificates and signatures, in short, this company is trusted by everyone. </p><br><p>  It may give some authority to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_certificate_authorities"><strong>Intermediate Certification Authorities (Intermediate CA)</strong></a> , and they will sign documents on behalf of the <em>Main Center</em> . </p><br><h2>  <font color="#9cc2ce">Let's go to the math</font> </h2><br><p>  The words were mentioned: signature, certificate, etc.  How to implement it?  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography"><strong>Asymmetric encryption</strong></a> comes to the rescue. </p><br><p>  In order not to go into details and not to explain discrete mathematics and cryptography, let's clarify a couple of things: </p><br><p>  1) In short, and the main thing about asymmetric encryption. <br>  There are 2 keys - <em>Public</em> and <em>Private Key</em> .  Actually, keys are just big numbers. <br>  If a message is encrypted with <em>Public</em> , then only the corresponding <em>Private Key</em> can decrypt it. <br>  And vice versa: <br>  If the message is encrypted by <em>Private</em> , then it can only be decrypted by the corresponding <em>Public Key</em> . <br>  <em>The private key is</em> not given to anyone, the <em>Public</em> <em>key</em> is actually public. </p><br><p>  2) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature"><strong>Digital Signature</strong></a> is a part of the document encrypted <em>with the</em> Subscriber‚Äôs <em>Private Key</em> .  If it can be decrypted with the Public Key of the Subscriber, then we can confidently assert that it was the Subscriber who encrypted it. </p><br><p>  3) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate"><strong>A Certificate (Digital Certificate)</strong></a> is usually a file, most often with the extension .cer or .pem. <br>  It contains: </p><br><ul><li>  Owner Information (Subject) </li><li>  Subscriber Information (Issuer) </li><li>  Signature Information (SSL Version, Algorithm) </li><li>  Certificate Fingerprints </li><li>  Public key </li><li>  Digital Signature (Signature) </li><li>  Expiration Date </li><li>  And a lot of information, depending on the version, but the rest we do not need. </li></ul><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Certificate Example</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><p>  COMODO Certification Authority <br>  Identity: COMODO Certification Authority <br>  Verified by: COMODO Certification Authority <br>  Expires: 12/31/29 </p><br><p>  <strong>Subject Name</strong> <br>  C (Country): GB <br>  ST (State): Greater Manchester <br>  L (Locality): Salford <br>  O (Organization): COMODO CA Limited <br>  CN (Common Name): COMODO Certification Authority </p><br><p>  <strong>Issuer Name</strong> <br>  C (Country): GB <br>  ST (State): Greater Manchester <br>  L (Locality): Salford <br>  O (Organization): COMODO CA Limited <br>  CN (Common Name): COMODO Certification Authority </p><br><p>  <strong>Issued Certificate</strong> <br>  Version: 3 <br>  Serial Number: 4E 81 2D 8A 82 65 E0 0B 02 EE 3E 35 02 46 E5 3D <br>  Not Valid Before: 2006-12-01 <br>  Not Valid After: 2029-12-31 </p><br><p>  <strong>Certificate Fingerprints</strong> <br>  SHA1: 66 31 BF 9E F7 4F 9E B6 C9 D5 A6 0C BA 6A BE D1 F7 BD EF 7B <br>  MD5: 5C 48 DC F7 42 72 EC 56 94 6D 1C CC 71 35 80 75 </p><br><p>  <strong>Public Key Info</strong> <br>  Key Algorithm: RSA <br>  Key Parameters: 05 00 <br>  Key Size: 2048 <br>  Key SHA1 Fingerprint: 11 E4 91 D1 C9 E4 C0 EB 9A CE CF 73 54 5D E1 F1 A8 30 3E C3 <br>  Public Key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p><br><p>  <strong>Subject Key Identifier</strong> <br>  Key Identifier: 0B 58 E5 8B C6 4C 15 37 A4 40 A9 30 A9 21 BE 47 36 5A 56 FF <br>  Critical: No </p><br><p>  <strong>Key Usage</strong> <br>  Usages: Digital signature <br>  Critical: Yes <br>  <strong>Basic Constraints</strong> <br>  Certificate Authority: Yes <br>  Max Path Length: Unlimited <br>  Critical: Yes </p><br><p>  <strong>Extension</strong> <br>  Identifier: 2.5.29.31 <br>  Value: 30 40 30 3E A0 3C A0 3A 86 38 68 74 74 70 3A 2F 2F 63 72 6C 2E 63 6F 6D 6F 64 6F 63 61 2E 63 6F 6D 2F 43 4F 4D 4F 44 4F 43 65 72 74 69 66 69 63 61 74 69 6F 6E 41 75 74 68 6F 72 69 74 79 2E 63 72 6C <br>  Critical: No </p><br><p>  <strong>Signature</strong> <br>  Signature Algorithm: SHA1 with RSA <br>  Signature Parameters: 05 00 <br>  Signature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p></div></div><br><h2>  <font color="#9cc2ce">What happens at each of the subjects</font> </h2><br><h4>  <font color="##292e5b">1) Let's start with Root CA</font> </h4><br><ul><li>  <em>Private key</em> generated </li><li>  <em>Public key</em> generated </li><li>  Information about <em>CA</em> is added, expiration date is set </li><li>  The certificate is signed with its own <em>Private Key</em> : <br><ul><li>  A message is selected for encryption.  What exactly is encrypted, determines the algorithm and the version of SSL.  For the end user, this does not matter, since all versions of encryption and hashing are also placed in the certificate, and they are used when decrypting the same versions. </li><li>  Message is encrypted and digital signature is obtained. </li><li>  Message is hashed, and it turns out FingerPrint. <br>  All this is going to a bunch and it turns out, the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-signed_certificate"><strong>Self-Signed Certificate</strong></a> . </li></ul></li></ul><br><h4>  <font color="##292e5b">2) This Self Signed Certificate is distributed to customers.</font> </h4><br><p>  An example client is a browser.  In any browser you can see a list of certificates. <br>  For example in Chrome: Settings -&gt; Manage Certificates -&gt; Authorities. <br>  Now the client knows about the existence of a CA. </p><br><h4>  <font color="##292e5b">3) Proof of Authenticity</font> </h4><br><p>  If you do not go into details, then this item is the same for the <em>Server</em> and <em>Intermediate Authentication Centers</em> </p><br><ul><li>  Private key generated </li><li>  Public key generated </li><li>  Information about CA is added, expiration date is determined </li><li>  Formed so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_signing_request"><strong>Certificate Request (CSR</strong></a> ) </li><li>  <em>The CSR is</em> signed by the <em>Private Key of the</em> nearest Certification Authority chain.  Actually, this is what the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_of_trust"><strong>Certificate Chain</strong></a> is called when the <em>Certification Centers</em> one by one sign the next certificate, right up to the final one - the Server Certificate. </li></ul><br><p>  As a result, we have a <em>Self Signed Certificate</em> on the client and a <em>Signed Server Certificate</em> on the server, i.e.  the client knows and trusts the CA and CA has guaranteed the authenticity of the server. </p><br><h4>  <font color="##292e5b">4) Directly dialogue</font> </h4><br><p>  Now let's see what happens when the client accesses the server.  To do this, use the Network dump from <a href="https://wiki.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a> . </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1c8/0e7/a89/1c80e7a89a3347f899756eeba3bfcbc4.png"><br><ul><li>  TCP 3 way handshake is the mechanism for starting a connection using the TCP protocol.  From the dump, it is clear that the client from port 33311 initiated a connection to the server running on port 8443. </li><li>  Secure Data Transmission is already the transfer, directly, of data over an encrypted channel. </li><li>  TLS handshake is what interests us.  Details on this can be found <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/ws-ssl-security/">here</a> , but we consider only the work with certificates. </li></ul><br><p>  We see messages: <br>  <strong>Client Hello, Server Hello, Change Cipher Spec, Encrypted Handshake Message</strong> </p><br><p>  The following shows what these messages carry: </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/039/50a/268/03950a2683314141883ff69b0772f953.png"><br><p>  As you can see, along with <em>Server Hello, the</em> Client receives the <em>Server Certificate</em> Chain ( <em>Server Certificate</em> ). <br>  How the client verifies the authenticity of the Certificate.  How does this happen: <br>  1) <em>The client</em> checks if he has a <em>Root CA</em> for the top certificate in the chain, <br>  if not, it goes down the chain below, and each time it checks to see if the certificate was really signed by the previous one in the chain.  (It's simple - the digital signature of the lower one must be decrypted with the public key of the upper one). <br>  If you have not found it, then the Client and Server do not have a mutual familiar CA, you cannot trust the server. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4a7/577/fcf/4a7577fcff5a4038a3b6e89f5d26e3c9.png"><br>  2) if there is - the <em>Client</em> takes the <em>Public Key of</em> his certificate and tries to decrypt the signature of the certificate that came from the Server. </p><br><ul><li>  if it fails, then the Server has changed the CA certificate and cannot be trusted. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4a7/577/fcf/4a7577fcff5a4038a3b6e89f5d26e3c9.png"></li><li>  and, finally, if everything is OK, everything was decrypted, the expiration dates of all certificates are valid, and some other conditions that are determined by the SSL version are met, then the server can be trusted. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ee7/cdb/807/ee7cdb80711f4709b485a07b605e6fdd.png"></li></ul><br><h4>  <font color="##292e5b">Note</font> </h4><br><p>  TLS also supports the Server trust mechanism to the client.  As you can see from Figure 5, in response to Server Hello, a client certificate can arrive, and the server can also verify that the CA has guaranteed its authenticity. </p><br><h2>  <font color="#9cc2ce">Conclusion</font> </h2><br><p>  So, when both parties are convinced that their interlocutors are those whom they claim to be, you can begin the dialogue.  Moreover, everything is immediately there for further message encryption - the private key on the server side, and its public key on the client, which was sent with the server certificate.  But in the future, asymmetric encryption is used only once - when the client encrypts the password with the public key of the server, and sends it to the server - <em>KlientKeyExchange</em> .  Further, this password is already used for symmetric encryption of messages, since it is much faster and easier than asymmetric.  Mechanisms for choosing the encryption protocol and ensuring the integrity of messages are a huge area of ‚Äã‚Äãmathematics and cryptography, but, fortunately for the user, it is already implemented under the hood of SSL.  All that is needed is that the client and server have compatible versions of SLL, cipher, and cryptographic providers. </p><br><p>  In the end, I would like to say that the protocols of secure communication: </p><br><ul><li>  very complicated and confusing - there are lots of versions, protocols, ciphers, and you never know when the message will come out to you - "NoSuchAlgorithmException - Some versions of something are not compatible" or "IllegalBlockSizeException - The size of something too big or small" </li><li>  non-persistent - today the browser normally enters your server, and tomorrow it will already say - that 2048 is too short for the key, saying it is unsecured and will not enter </li><li>  computing, especially with asymmetrical encryption, is very resource-intensive, and on systems just 5-7 years old, the TLS Handshake process can take 10-20 seconds </li></ul><br><p>  But the main, and perhaps sufficient, argument for - HTTPS and TLS are really as secure as possible. </p><br><p>  <strong>Useful links on the topic</strong> <br>  <a href="http://www.youdzone.com/signature.html">http://www.youdzone.com/signature.html</a> <br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/258285/">https://habrahabr.ru/post/258285/</a> <br>  <a href="https://datacenteroverlords.com/2012/03/01/creating-your-own-ssl-certificate-authority/">https://datacenteroverlords.com/2012/03/01/creating-your-own-ssl-certificate-authority/</a> <br>  <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/126121/how-to-create-my-own-certificate-chain">http://superuser.com/questions/126121/how-to-create-my-own-certificate-chain</a> </p></div>
