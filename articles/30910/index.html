  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Case: Wiki for HTC America</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>Introduction:</b> <br><br>  For ten years, HTC has been designing, manufacturing and marketing innovative, state-of-the-art smartphones and handheld PCs.  If you purchased a device that runs Windows Mobile OS, then it is likely that this phone is from HTC.  Here in the USA, they are sold under the brands of regional distributors (Sprint, T-Mobile, Cingular and Verizon), and in other places under the brand name HTC, Q-Tek, iMate and other logos of local distributors. <br><br>  Founded in 1997, High Tech Computer Corp.  (HTC) is a technology provider that specializes in the latest developments in mixed mobile devices.  During its existence, the company has powerfully developed its research and development capabilities, for the first time applied many new approaches in the design and development of innovative products, and also released very modern PDA phones and smartphones for operators and distributors of the global telecommunications industry.

      HTC has organized a completely unique collaboration with leading mobile operators, including five leading European mobile operators, four top US operators and many fast-growing operators in Asia.  In addition, the company's huge research and development capabilities attract the most advanced technology developers to work with HTC to create the best applications, as well as to present and promote mobile services throughout the world. <br><br>  <b>The essence of the business problem:</b> <br><br>  Today, one of the main business problems for HTC America is the need to take care and help people in their quest to use all the opportunities offered by the smartphone.  The main task was to train novice users how to handle their new devices and solve any difficulties that may arise during the setup process and, thus, avoid confusion and reduce the cost of the support department.  In addition, HTC had a goal to get new users to educate a wider audience regarding the advantages of using a smartphone compared to a standard mobile phone, which has limited communication capabilities. <br><br>  <b>The target audience:</b> <br><br>  To address this dilemma, HTC turned to Waggener Edstrom for help in finding creative and progressive ways to influence the root of the problem, in order to enlighten and satisfy consumers.  For the most part, the target users consisted of techno-enthusiasts, while getting exactly this audience was also beneficial for HTC partners, including cell phone distributors, developers and software vendors. <br><br>  <b>Program goals and objectives:</b> <br><br>  As mentioned above, HTC invited Waggener Edstrom to help her deal with this problem.  Then Waggener Edstrom recommended creating the HTC Community Wiki - an interactive website based on user-generated content that would help customers (and potential customers) explore the complexities of their devices, including customization, usage, useful tips, and lay out in open access user experience.  An accompanying task was to create a community of smartphone users who, in turn, would help each other solve problems and create their own support network. <br><br>  A wiki is an interactive community of like-minded enthusiasts.  Thanks to content management tools that anyone who registers on the site can use, everyone can add, comment, correct and publish content.  This can be called open-source customer support.  In general, a wiki is a full-fledged site-community, open to customers and just fans who love their smartphones and who are willing to help others expand their experience. <br><br>  <b>Decision:</b> <br><br>  To solve this problem and create a wiki, Waggener Edstrom developed a creative concept for the Wiki, including markup, design and navigation, suggested and developed the initial content and developed a comprehensive promotion strategy to announce the mainstream enthusiast of the smartphone and give the site growth impetus.  In addition, we found and attracted to participate an external hosting company that could maintain the site and the main traffic as the Wiki evolves. <br><br>  In the field of promotion, Waggener Edstrom has developed a solid strategy for informing selected media that the Wiki is opening for spontaneous self-support.  This included the notification of certain blogs related to the subject of gadgets and various devices in general, that the project was launched and was designed to receive feedback and cause excitement in this environment.  As soon as the site was completely ready, we again alerted key blogs, and Gizmodo, Smart Phone Thoughts, HTC Wizard Web, The Unwired, and other blogs related to mobile themes announced a wiki on July 25, and from now on, the number of visitors and registered users jumped sharply. <br><br>  <b>Results:</b> <br><br>  Officially, the HTC Wiki was launched at the end of July and over a month and a half the site has grown powerfully and now 13,000 unique visitors visit it per day.  In addition, the number of devices described on the wiki increased by 300%, and the registered participants by 540 profiles.  Most of the postings and comments carried a big positive and the site quickly became the main resource where you can ask a question not only about HTC devices, but about smartphones in general. <br><br>  Most of the press and analysts were very impressed with our concept and commented on it as the right move on the part of HTC, namely, to occupy its unique niche between customers and mobile operators.  One of the most influential mobile industry bloggers, Ryan Block from Engadget, gave the following comment about the wiki: <br><br><blockquote>  <i>‚ÄúI rarely say that, but the Wiki is super.</i>  <i>It doesn't matter whose idea it was, the main thing is that now their fingers are on the pulse of HTC users.</i>  <i>It will take some time until the site is fully unwound, like any wiki.</i>  <i>I personally signed up. "</i> </blockquote><br><br>  <b>Translation from English to:</b> <br>  <a href="http://blog.worldwebstudio.com/">blog.worldwebstudio.com</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/30910/">https://habr.com/ru/post/30910/</a></p>
