  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Babushkofony without warranty</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I recently thought about buying a phone for my mother.  My old Samsung C100, which, like many, was inherited by my mother, began to podglyuchivat.  Well, the letters are too small on the keyboard and screen.  People with poor eyesight are not easy to handle. <br>  A short googling led me to Just5 and Cp09 phones. <br> <a href="http://kartinkohosting/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/aff/4f1/7a2/aff4f17a21c287390e685f72d815f8e2.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The models are absolutely structurally identical with the only difference that Cp09 costs 3500r.  And it is locked to Megafon, and Just5 costs 3,930 rubles.  and not locked. <br>  After reading the reviews on them, having estimated the pros and cons, it was decided to get acquainted with Just5 personally in the ION store, one of whose branches is located 5 minutes away from my home. <br>  As soon as I appeared there, the sales consultant jumped up to me helpfully and naturally asked what was interesting for me.  I said that I was interested in this device and I would like to hold it in my hands, test usability, and in general. <br>  Further, I will not describe the incompetence of the seller, who knows everything only in words, but in practice he sits and understands with the client and not quite obvious menu items on the phone (how to send a text message without using the instructions, it was possible to figure out only 15 minutes later) because it goes beyond framework of the main topic.  Okay.  A little thought, I decided to take all the same. <br>  Further, it is better to transfer in the form of a dialogue.  I - I, P - the seller. <br>  I: - Well, I take.  Warranty card is? <br>  P: - Uhhhh ...  Well, he has a year of warranty, I will give you a cash voucher and a sales receipt, if that is the guarantee of a check. <br>  Me: - Allow, allow, cash receipt only confirms the fact, the price and time of purchase.  Nothing else. <br>  P: - Well ...  You can and check ... <br>  I: - Well, where is it then written that he has 1 year warranty? <br>  P: - ????  [puzzled face] <br>  I: - Do you have a document confirming your words?  Or, if, God forbid, it breaks down in six months, I can come to the store and refer to the words of the seller, who is probably not working here? <br>  P: - Mmmmmm ... ... Well, I'll clarify. <br>  Then the seller asked other sellers, dug in some pieces of paper, looked at the Internet, dug in the instructions for the phone, but did not find the supplier except his legal address, spread his hands and said that there was nothing. <br>  I refused to buy and left lost in thought.  There were questions in my head: <br>  1. Am I the first to ask them such questions? <br>  2. Well, maybe I'm a paranoid and really could be taken and not afraid? <br>  3. Sony, Panasonic, LG, Samsung and other reputable companies are fools or what, that they issue warranty cards, where they write warranty periods, conclude contracts with service centers and so on?  It turns out everything is so simple - he released the product, shoved it into the store, and whatever happened there.  Well, I would even agree with this circumstance if the phone cost 1000-1500 rubles.  - this is precisely its adequate price.  But almost 4000 for a Chinese phone with such poor functionality without a guarantee?  - in my opinion it is too. <br>  Yes, I know that ION has its own service centers.  Yes, there is the Law on Protection of Consumer Rights, and probably there you can find some article under which you can take the seller, but honestly, so tired of all butting.  I just want to come, buy and that there would be no problems with the guarantee. <br>  Ehhhhh ... Russia ... <br><br>  When I got home, I checked the website of the phone supplier company, OrbitTelecom.  About the guarantee - not a word.  There is generally very little of any information.  There is not even a contact phone.  As they say, write letters. <br><br>  The purpose of this post to warn against the purchase of this phone to clarify the warranty circumstances;  once again reflect on the decency of ION stores;  to be more alert. </div>
