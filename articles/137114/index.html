We are very pleased that now with you!  Believe me, this is extremely important for us - to be in touch with professionals.  We also consider ourselves professionals and your comments are evidence of that. <br>  We are dynamically developing and expanding.  We really need now iOS / Android developers, to whom we are ready to offer everything in order for them to work very interesting and super comfortable.  About this in more detail and a little later. <br>  In the meantime, a little about how to get to our team.  It's simple!  You just need to be able to break bricks! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ff4/869/1e7/ff48691e76db933ef8b8cff8d8bb74fb.png" alt="image"><br><br>  However, in order for us to know how cool you are able to do it, it is not necessary to send a photo or video of your exploits, you will declare yourself much more seriously if you write a prototype of an arcanoid game in which for you this will make a ball bouncing off the bits ...

    <a name="habracut"></a>  <b>THE TASK</b> <br>  <b>You need to make a primitive version of the game Arkanoid: there is a bit, which we control left-right (the implementation of control is yours), and a ball that flies away from this bit and the edges of the screen.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Task: to break a brick, which is in an arbitrary place.</b>  <b>If</b> <b><br></b>  <b>the ball touches the bottom of the screen, the game is considered lost.</b> <b><br><br></b>  <b>Game requirements:</b> <b><br></b>  <b>- Rendering should be implemented using OpenGL</b> <b><br></b>  <b>- The game must support any screen resolution.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>- The game should be written in Objective-C in the case of iOS, or using NDK (C ++) in the case of Android, without using any third-party libraries (such as Cocos2D).</b> <br><br>  <u><b>Question:</b></u> Why is this task (seemingly simple enough) very difficult and long time to be performed even by advanced developers?  Maybe it only seems simple at first sight?  Can it really last for a long time, and not how we calculated it - 16 hours?  Are any of you ready to do it? <br>  Everyone who implements it, we will be happy to see as a potential colleague in our team, well, or just to understand that there are such people here!  We have many interesting and diverse tasks and Cut The Rope is not our only project.  There are still many new and equally successful games ahead!  Send your solutions to the <i>job@zeptolab.com job</i> ! <br><br>  Well, now, actually, in more detail about the Company and work with us or what we are ready to offer the most. <br><br>  The fresh word "work" does not apply to us.  In ZeptoLab, one may say, they live, study, develop, communicate, generate ideas and implement them, and not just fulfill their functional duties.  In our team there are people who are passionate about their favorite business, who adore games, for which it is important to freely express themselves, to come to the office with pleasure, to actively realize their creative potential.  We have created and cultivate an atmosphere of openness, solidarity, and respect for each other.  If you are a novice developer, then we are ready to teach you and we have the resources for this.  If you have the desire and potential, we will help your professional growth in every way.  In general, we are ready to invest in employees much more than many other employers.  It is important for us that each employee understands that he earns good money, the employer takes care of his training, and the employer also takes care of health, and he also for quality and tasty food. <br><br>  Separately, I would like to talk about comfort.  The beginning of the day is not fixed and everyone comes to someone as convenient.  For many, the day starts with breakfast and delicious coffee.  Who does not like coffee, drinks tea, juice or kefir, eats yoghurts a variety of fruits or complex sandwiches.  We always have a supply of sweets, baking and, of course, branded Om-Nomovskih karamelek! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fe6/3f2/5cf/fe63f25cfee9bd744600286a7e513130.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  They all work exclusively on Macs, some on large stationary, some on mini-airs.  At lunch they bring delicious food to us, and in the evenings, twice a week - warm and flavorful pizza or pies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/292/068/e9e/292068e9e365b4406205be7b34eb641d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Since we are actively expanding and it became cramped for us in our office, we rented a new and spacious room.  Very soon we will move there.  New office is a separate conversation!  For us, a design project was developed and ordinary gray walls turned into a very cozy office space.  As soon as we move, if you are interested, we will notify you about this with a special post. <br><br>  For the convenience of ill staff, we asked our insurance company to attach us to the best clinics and hospitals in the area in which our office is located.  Also, in order for employees to strengthen their health, the Company pays 50% of the cost of a club card in one of the best fitness centers near our office.  In order to save employees from any domestic problems, the Company signed a contract with one of the companies providing personal services.  So if you need to clean the apartment, repair the home refrigerator or nail the picture, and also take something somewhere or fix your favorite jacket in the studio, you need to call this company and call the wizard / cleaner / courier to your home. <br>  In order not to bathe at all (especially our beautiful girls), we agreed with the beauty salon, which is located in our business center, that our employees (at the expense of the company, again) can put themselves in order ( haircuts, manicures, etc.) without spending a minute on the way to the hairdresser!  And absolutely so that the head does not hurt even about the upcoming vacation, the Company entered into an agreement with a travel agency through which employees can book hotels, buy tickets or package tours.  The company allocates 50,000 rubles per person per year. <br>  Of the more standard, but necessary options, there is also: payment of gasoline, mobile, various travel (from the subway to the train). <br>  And we always have in stock a few piles of various-sized T-shirts and sweatshirts with the image of Om-Nom. <br><br><img src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/5601/11554682.1/0_71fc2_32d307c1_L.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As for training, each employee independently or with the help of a mentor plans his or her training and attends educational activities in various popular training centers, participates in conferences, webinars, buys e-books and distance learning courses.  Someone needs to tighten up English, someone needs Ruby or iOS etc. <br>  Now several people have registered for participation in the Atlantic Systems Guild 2012 conference. And four more people on the Toaster.  In general, who wants to learn - learns. <br><br>  How do we celebrate the holidays?  Fun and active.  Join curling and sing karaoke, shoot paintballs or go to beautiful places near Moscow. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4d8/99b/7e0/4d899b7e03821957cd825ac069d13935.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the evenings, sometimes we are going to play some board games or not at all board games, such as Q-ZAR or bowling. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c32/7dd/103/c327dd10333b49f4bfe3f59f66150cab.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Here is such a ZeptoLab! <br>  We are looking forward to your completed test tasks, and those who perform them - in our team. <br><br>  See you! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/137114/">https://habr.com/ru/post/137114/</a></p>
