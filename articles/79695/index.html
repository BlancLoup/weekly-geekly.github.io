I was naively sure that this is the only way for us.  In fact, most of the small studios have the same features.  You may not agree with me, I do not impose my opinion on anyone.  Perhaps your experience suggests otherwise, but still. <br><br>  I realized that those are bad studios that remain small for a long time.  They should either fall apart completely or grow into solid offices.  Where is the boundary between a small and medium-sized studio?  The border is rather subjective, looking at a young carrot, it can be said with confidence that it is large, but it‚Äôs small or older, each of us defines this border for himself.

      Now I work in a large reputable company.  And to be honest, in the well-established large working mechanism, the screws feel much more comfortable than in the small unconfigured and buggy.  For the last time I had to watch several abstract individuals suitable for the subjective definition of a small studio.  And I was surprised to find in them all the features and all the problems that I had to observe for a long time where I worked.  More tears under the cut. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  ‚ÄúSmall studios are different from large studios in their size,‚Äù KO says.  and will be right.  This implies the following: the responsibility of each employee is much higher; if you freeze, then no one else will do your work for you;  everyone understands that the result of his work directly affects not only his salary, but also the salary of his comrades.  Attention!  The bad hasn't started yet.  On the contrary, in theory, in such conditions, the better and more you work, the more money you personally have at the end of the month. <br><br>  And here begins the bad.  I will not say why and who is to blame, but in the end it turns out that you have to plow 12 hours a day to get your small money with two-week delays.  There are few orders, salespeople run after each client, take something strange for ridiculous money or on some kind of partnership conditions (I remember they made an online store on 10% of the deals, for a month they bought 3 T-shirts of 10 bucks).  The boss does not know where to get money for the next month, but pretends that everything is fine.  At the same time, it breaks down on managers, which mow and press the developers, because of which they are forced to work at night.  Everything is done hastily and just to do.  The correct code, comments, frameworks, what are you talking about? <br><br>  Plus, at least 10-15 people work in the company, you feel not as part of a team, but just a cog on which nothing depends (paradox?).  Activity falls, you pull comrades (or they you).  And what if the boss really doesn‚Äôt know how to do business? <br><br>  Someone can go (and leave) where it is better, someone to the last considers himself part of a startup.  Once, the three of them started this company with the current boss, but now he somehow imperceptibly turned out to be a simple hired worker.  It is very difficult to leave even when everything seems to be bad.  What if it gets better?  And again to start all over again. <br><br>  And for some reason I am sure that the crisis has nothing to do with it.  If there were no crisis, would people and their approach to business change?  It is doubtful. <br><br>  I decided for myself - I myself raise my business in a startup or work in a large, stable company.  No cog work in a small studio.  Dismiss. <br><br>  <b>What was this all about?</b> <br><br>  I'm telling you, KO came.  and told all.  I'm shocked. <br><br>  In fact, I‚Äôm looking here, the people at Habr√©, and not only write that they say the studio is cheating, and so on.  Even in the States such garbage.  Do you think anyone is cheating?  Just the bosses of such small offices, which have nothing to pay with their own.  But they differ from freelancers in that they are in the know of the company's affairs, but freelancers do not.  So the boss is running: he received money for 1 project, paid off the debts partially, hired even more people for the promises, paid off the previous performers.  That's how we live. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/79695/">https://habr.com/ru/post/79695/</a></p>
