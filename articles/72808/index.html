I will not retell the events a year ago, anyone can familiarize themselves with <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/i_am_advertising/40634/">them</a> . <br><br>  In short, this site is a closed collective blog (I don‚Äôt like this word, the club is better, which better reflects what is happening there).  Moreover, you don‚Äôt have to have friends inside to get an invite (you can‚Äôt buy it either) - for one simple reason: we don‚Äôt have invites, anyone can send their own story inside, a story about themselves or just <i>something</i> that might interest us ( we do not know what might interest us).  People inside vote for each story (with the filing of the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/maratori/" class="user_link">maratori,</a> we call these stories playzapruvami), and every night a special customs droid looks: if more than 50% of active users voted for the story, then this person is given a link to the registration.  It's simple.  The theme of the site is not limited to anything, write what you want.  And I will continue my story ... <br><br>  Closer to winter, the project as it was, exhausted itself - many factors affected that Denis did not take into account at one time.  In short, Denis was forced to close the project, leaving a stub on the site, which, they say, will soon be a new "trent" (or "quadra", as some called it).  Time passed, but there was no movement on the site.  I, as one of the old-timers of the old Quadra (and, I must admit, I liked the site very much), often asked Denis about the future of TQ.  Denis replied that the works were, the programmer was silent like a fish on ice, this is a setra, this is a setra.  And so, at the end of this spring, I wrote a letter to Denis in the mail ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>Episode Two: Three years of hard work and ten thousand years of great happiness!</strong> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/146/10a/616/14610a616f77ddd40ae4e6ce27b93177.png" alt="image"><br>  Having yearned for Quadre, I asked Denis to contact Dmitry Stolpovsky (Dio), the programmer of the project, so that he would somehow give me the source code of the site, which I, with technical support from Nikolai Belikov, another soldier of the old guard (aka <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/cre8r/" class="user_link">cre8r</a> ), I wanted to put it at the old address, but on a new technical platform.  Denis said that the old code is probably lost forever.  After that, I hinted that you can write a new code and draw a new design (and he, of course, also did not survive, even there are no screenshots), and one of the interlocutors is clearly a programmer, and the second is a designer. <br>  So the impetus was given to the new version of Quadra, which we both were extremely happy about.

      The new site was named TrentaQuattro - Refilled, which should symbolize tons of new ideas and interesting ideas (and there are enough of them, sorry for the indiscretion).  Not in the shortest possible time (work, after all) Denis made the layout of the site and from time to time pleased me with new HTML files of different pages.  I kneaded my fingers and keys after a two-year break in programming, recalled drunken skills and, in the meantime, created Quadra.  The process was very difficult and painful, we could not remember many details of the internal organization, we had to invent something on the go.  We fantasized, invented, put up for discussion the most delusional ideas that, after polishing, became new functions, jokes and Easter eggs of the site.  On the earliest versions of the site, it was already clear that this would be not just a closed blog, but a whole organism living by its own laws, simple from the outside, complex inside and damn human in all respects.  Literally breaking the chain after a prolonged timeout in programming, I invented and introduced all the new functionality (sometimes I was surprised more than Denis, who sometimes went to the construction site), which turned the site into what all sites that position themselves must be as Web 2.0, and TQ is positioning itself that way.  Many people from the old TQ staff were invited, one of the old-timers somehow kept a whole archive of nicknames and addresses of many active users whom we successfully invited for beta testing. <br><br>  May the reader forgive me for such a long preface, but the story itself of the construction of the new Quadra is worthy of a novelization and film adaptation - indeed, the construction of the century! <br><br>  <strong>Episode Three: The Knights of the New Republic</strong> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7e3/324/337/7e33243375cef3b2fb7ae9799e9fa2d6.png" alt="image"><br>  So, on October 15 of this year, at 15:00 Kyiv time (since I live and work in the hero city of Dnepropetrovsk), the server trentaquattro.ru was, with fireworks, speeches and concerts of pop stars, the golden code of version 2.5 was solemnly flooded Œ≥.  For convenience, the first version of TQ was named 1.0, and the updated one began to begin with 2.0. <br><br>  <i>NB By the way, trenta quattro in Italian means 34.</i> <br><br>  The list of added functionality, in principle, does not make sense to even try to list, but I still try to at least outline the global changes.  First of all, this is design.  Although I have not drawn anything more complicated than a circle and a square since the third class, I have to admit that the design has become much better - restrained or something.  If earlier it was the sophomore recklessness, now it is the well-trained concierge of an expensive Swiss hotel (as stated).  Secondly, the internal organization.  If earlier the site had minimal inclusions of AJAX technology, now the site is practically built on them, which gives a very high speed of movement on it.  In addition, at the request of the user, the system can automatically load adjacent pages to speed up their loading.  Every minute this homebrew cache is updated.  To navigate through the pages of the site, our studio‚Äôs own development, Page`o`matic-9000, is used.  In normal mode, its own Telegraph works.  In addition, the site does not accept sexual prejudice, so there are already four sexes: male, female, middle, and collective minds.  Every week, on Monday evening at a random time, anyone who has time can choose a color for their own comments.  Say "yes" to color differentiation!  Lovers of HTML and javascript will find a large number of Easter eggs, and lovers of something to crack or forge an AJAX request and big surprises await at all :) And finally - every TC user can vote for posting to the outside world.  You can look at the posts outside <a href="http://trentaquattro.ru/%3Fhalloffame">here</a> . <br><br>  Such things help the website to the best of their abilities: Smarty template engine, MooTools javascript-framework and wonderful Jevix parser.  Well, there, of course, a couple more are smaller, but they will not be offended. <br>  Quadra perfectly shows in these browsers: Safari, Chrome (and the rest of the webcam, in short), Firefox, IE (above version six) and even Opera I dislike. <br><br>  So, ladies and gentlemen, the artel named after 2002 ‚ÄúOlolo Tortures‚Äù presents to you ‚ÄúTrentaQuattro - Refilled‚Äù and invites you ... Just invites. <br><br>  Stand to the end! <br><br>  <a href="http://www.trtq.ru/">www.trentaquattro.ru</a> <br><br>  PS And we do not have karma at all. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/72808/">https://habr.com/ru/post/72808/</a></p>
