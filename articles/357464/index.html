  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Klimenko: Russia is technically ready to disconnect from the global network</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In a recent <a href="http://www.ntv.ru/video/1566806/">interview, the</a> adviser to the Russian president on Internet development issues, German Klimenko, assured that Russia is technically ready to disconnect from the global network: he is confident that this will not be painless, some difficulties will inevitably arise, but ‚Äúby itself, in hardware, software, there are no contraindications that we live well and normally, effectively, even if such a war is declared against us, something like Crimean isolation. ‚Äù  "We have everything to fight." <br><br>  With a strong spirit I can advise you to watch this interview in its entirety, in order to learn about viruses that viruses have infected computers, whether South, or North Korea, and the final solution of the issue with the grandmothers.  For those who feel sorry for half an hour of listening to this fascinating conversation, I prepared a squeeze of the most interesting ideas expressed in the interview. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So, the adviser on Internet development believes that we must prepare our information space for existence outside the world.  As an argument of the need to prepare for isolation (self-isolation?), The situation with the services of commercial companies (Google, Oracle, Microsoft) that do not work in the Crimea due to the banal legal contradictions is given: ‚ÄúYes, you can just take a button and make a rogue country out of the country, it's true. ‚ÄùWhoever has this button in their hands is not reported, but it‚Äôs quite likely that we have different points of view on this issue.

      According to Klimenko, Russia, along with the United States and China, is one of the three countries with the ‚Äúfull Internet cycle‚Äù: its own search engines, social networks, advertising services.  At the same time, Russia is the world's best "security expert", "we even stood at the heart of security: Kaspersky, Doctor Web appeared with us and then <a href="https://phraseology.academic.ru/4952/%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE_%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D1%2583">went around the world</a> ."  Here I would note that the understanding of security can be quite broad, especially if you ask yourself what (or who) needs protection from ‚Äî and from whom. <br><br>  Klimenko compares the work on Internet regulation with the introduction of traffic regulations and considers it an inevitable process: ‚ÄúNobody has won the state for a long time.‚Äù  To the question about the prospects for the introduction of 5G answers evasively: it seems like 5G itself is not needed, but ‚Äúperhaps on the way to this 5G we will reach 5G‚Äù.  He admits that our state has firmly grown together with business: ‚Äúit happened historically‚Äù (and this is the most recent history, considering that the state‚Äôs share in the economy has <a href="https://www.vedomosti.ru/economics/articles/2016/09/29/658959-goskompanii-kontroliruyut-ekonomiki">grown</a> from 35% in 2005 to 70% in 2015). <br><br>  As for the anonymity of the network, Klimenko believes that at the moment anonymity is replaced by privacy, and this is a global trend.  In America, everything is drained by the state, there is no anonymity.  As, of course, both in China and in Europe.  Refusal of anonymity in the next 2-5 years is inevitable.  But in Russia now is the freest internet, if we objectively compare with other countries.  At the same time, "if a person writes something on Vkontakte, he will be brought to justice." <br><br>  Finally - a quote from German Klimenko from another interview, another couple of years before being appointed presidential adviser: <br>  ‚ÄúI am a wimp.  If in order to have black caviar in the fridge, you need to shout "Putin is great!", Then I will scream. " <br><br>  Watch out for yourself.  Be careful. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/357464/">https://habr.com/ru/post/357464/</a></p>
