  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Destructive printers for the healthcare modernization program</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I work as an admin in a municipal polyclinic; I lead the community ‚ÄúIT in medicine: Irkutsk and the Irkutsk region‚Äù (there is a <a href="http://italks%40conference.jabber.ru/">jabber-konf</a> , <a href="http://vk.com/italks">VK</a> , <a href="http://italks.livejournal.com/">blog</a> , mailing list and even a phone book).  Came here in 2010 for 2 implementations: electronic medical records and "electronic" entry to specialists.  Medicine is a very promising direction for implementation, everything works and therefore I like it very much) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8fa/a4a/8f2/8faa4a8f219ca1a728f4333449dd3ca4.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The start of work at the new site was at the beginning of the ‚ÄúProgram for the Modernization of Healthcare in the Irkutsk Region for 2011-2012‚Äù.  I was immediately interested in several points: the creation of a LAN facility, the development of an MIS (medical information system) and the purchase of equipment (personal computers, printers, servers).  We ourselves were engaged in the development and coordination of LAN projects, and the regional ministry of health took over the development of IIAs and the centralized procurement of equipment through an auction.

It is always useful to compare your understanding of the informatization of medicine with the representation of other specialists).  Only the discussion of printers was closed for participation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2b9/164/51b/2b916451bb48db20980d5d7eb886b978.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In March, it became known that the entire region will receive the Xerox Phaser 3010 and the Xerox WorkCentre 3045B at the ministerial auction.  And me too.  I was upset. <br><br>  Briefly: these 2 models are such LED home devices, a resource of 30,000 pages, buggy and not refillable.  A starting cartridge on 300-700 pages.  The cost of 1 page = 1 ruble for the entire life of the device.  In the year one such toy "eat" 25t.r.  on raskhodku, and then die and cheaper to buy a new than repair.  For the year with this money you can buy 2 HP P2055, or with some extra charge Xerox WorkCentre 5016 (we do not take into account the dimensions, but both of the ‚Äúanalogs‚Äù definitely have more uses with us) along with a set of consumables (including a drum unit for 5016B) .  For the cost of 5 years of operation of the 3010x, we could buy already 4 HP P2055, or as many as 2 Xerox WorkCentre 5016B with a set of consumables for all 5 years. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4ce/a20/99a/4cea2099a059c3253bc958b5f757f85c.png" alt="image"><br><br>  After 2 weeks of deliberation, I pulled myself together and wrote this comparative analysis, with detailed calculations and illustrations: <br>  <a href="http://narod.ru/disk/49116669001.1ec60f698cc75e3e9dc8c7493174f985/Sravn_print.zip.html">Comparative analysis and calculation of the cost of ownership for printers Xerox Phaser 3010, obtained under the program of modernization of health care, with analogues from other manufacturers</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4c9/76f/257/4c976f257063ed4ab07d61c633eaaa42.png" alt="image"><br><br>  On occasion, I tried to spread it as widely as possible: the IT community in medicine, department, ministry, TFOMS.  IMHO before the delivery of equipment was a chance to change something else.  But in May 2012 the equipment in the amount of 1310 units was delivered to all institutions of the region.  I now have 15 of these LEDs in stock.  And someone, and 150, they did not even unpack, because it makes no sense.  A month later, all the printers installed on the posts ran out of toner.  We simply put them in the closet and put the <s>Xerox</s> pyramid there against the wall. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bf0/030/6ef/bf00306efc953f893558cb7ca6f073d8.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Health care is not as impoverished as education, we have a working economic model for CHI and VHI, we can afford to buy new equipment every quarter.  We do not need ‚Äúmodernization‚Äù handouts, for 5 years we are able to update the entire fleet of vehicles on our own.  Instead of ruining the expensive toner for the 3010x, we ordered 2pcs of HP P2055, repaired part of the old equipment and optimized the arrangement of the existing fleet of printers. <br><br>  PS: a week ago I once again raised the question for the occasion of the <a href="http://www.irk.ru/expert/medicine/464/">press conference</a> that had appeared that was <a href="http://www.irk.ru/expert/medicine/464/">the Minister of Health of the</a> Irkutsk Region, and today the answer came.  The ministry suddenly saw the light, a storm of indignation arose, my cherished desire to punish those responsible for the ‚Äúcrooked‚Äù design of the technical assignment and lobbying the interests of certain suppliers, the ministry decided to fulfill, but with the reservation dismiss me) ...  True, now, "according to the most reliable rumors" there is a chance that they will give additional funding for new printers ... It's funny) <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> due to the large number of people willing to join our group ‚ÄúIT in medicine: Irkutsk and Irkutsk Region‚Äù, I created a <a href="http://vk.com/itmed">new group for communication of medIt specialists</a> across the country.  By tradition, the group is open for the first 2 weeks, all materials are connected, you can freely add and add your content.  If it is useful to many, it will grow into something more.  I carry the hottest questions from italks into it, and a consolidated archive of documents.  Add and connect colleagues to the matrix) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/149007/">https://habr.com/ru/post/149007/</a></p>
