This is a time-tested approval and business issues in terms of organizing their own activities.  It turns out that the main headache of every entrepreneur is the maintenance of various kinds of documentation and something must be done with this. <br>  Waiting for a magical time when the tax inspectorate or other agencies can offer a free tool for conducting similar operations, automatic reporting is utopian.  The need to hire an accountant, the need for which for small businesses is not constant, has forced many to attract outside specialists.  Their experience allows you to quickly solve the tasks and predict some of the pitfalls that the taxation system is famous for.  This is one of the examples when the concept of outsourcing services began to enter the business model. <br>  Similar difficulties in IT-sphere have long been noticed.  The high wages of professional system administrators and the recurring need for them have led many managers to optimize this expenditure to the maximum.  The way out was all the same outsourcing. <br>  As a result, there are already quite a few examples of outsourcing in everyday life.  Not an exception and the scope of software products.  Today, more and more programs are moving from local use to network solutions, the so-called "cloud".  Consciously or unconsciously making a choice in the direction of these proposals, many managers over time notice that they have made the right decision.  This technology has been developing for several years and has already received its attractive name in the form of the abbreviation SaaS.  What is it?  Let's figure it out. <br><br>  <b>SaaS has come</b>

    <a name="habracut"></a>  With the increase in the effectiveness of various kinds of business process automation systems, medium and small businesses increasingly began to think about their implementation.  Improving the quality of documentation, the introduction of automatic cross-checking and improving the culture of production - the main results of the introduction of such systems.  Such news from users have become a catalyst, significantly increased the interest in SaaS. <br>  In response to these trends, software companies began to create products of varying complexity, focus, functionality and scale.  Each of them, starting from energetic amateurs of different caliber, ending with major developers, began to use all available methods of PR to promote their ideas. <br>  Colorful booklets and e-mails, various levels of presentations and seminars, consultations in conference rooms and offices.  All began to offer software products in different price categories.  Everyone promises to change life for the better the next day after the introduction, but how does the abbreviation SaaS work in life? <br><br>  <b>What is SaaS and what is it eaten with?</b> <br><br>  SaaS (from English Software as a Service) is a method of organizing software rental, in which the user is provided with a convenient WEB-interface that implements the functionality described in the technical specifications of the project or in the accompanying documentation.  Thus, a new business model of the relationship between the software developer and the buyer of its services is presented. <br>  Before the beginning of the analysis of positive and negative aspects, it is worth noting the main feature of this type of software - placing the main ‚Äúcore‚Äù of the software on the server of the software provider.  Hence all the benefits of SaaS: <br>  - the user gets rid of the need to install such software in his office, as it is hosted on the provider's server; <br>  - To work, you need a minimum set of licensed software; <br>  - there is no need to keep track of software updates, the operation of anti-virus systems, the performance, reliability of physical equipment; <br>  - you can not worry about the safety of information that is used by the provided software, since the reliability of modern DATE-centers is close to 100%; <br>  - the user's workplace is not tied to a specific computer and its computing power; <br>  - As world practice shows, such offers are cheaper than similar "boxed" versions. <br>  With the main positive aspects of the new concept of providing software, the situation has become clearer, since some of them are given.  Now pay attention to the negative. <br>  Two important aspects can be attributed to the negative aspects of the software provided on the basis of the SaaS concept: the need to transfer information to a third-party server and the sharp dependence of work speed on the quality of the Internet. <br><br>  <b>Analyzing the "cons" of SaaS.</b> <br><br>  After analyzing both negative factors, one can be cut off immediately.  The likelihood of problems with the provider is many times reduced due to the reservation of the channel.  Providing a backup Internet channel is often as easy as a backup power source.  Technically, these issues are solved simply. <br>  Considering the problems of non-disclosure of information, one can speculate and countless theories about its possible leakage.  However, the likelihood of such a development is minimal. <br>  Firstly, the likelihood of litigation on the fact of disclosure of commercial information of a legal entity is very high.  To risk the reputation and future of your project, few people will agree. <br>  Secondly, individual providers of SaaS services can provide an expert opinion of third parties on the use of their data encryption algorithms.  Decryption keys may not be available to anyone, or may be specified by the end user.  Such technologies have long been working and attackers, without risking to wait for many years to decrypt the access keys, tend to alternative ways of extracting information. <br>  Thirdly, the complex of measures aimed at protecting information in small companies is clearly insufficient.  In comparison with information protection systems at high-quality DATA centers, one can say that it is completely absent.  Thus, the list of possible channels for the extraction of information, which includes bribing employees, local or remote hacking of a computer, and installing special listening equipment, is being further expanded. <br>  Comparison of the facts leads to the conclusion about the existence of some other ‚Äúdisadvantages‚Äù of the proposed SaaS services, since there are no completely perfect systems a priori.  Deficiencies may manifest themselves over time, and are likely to be philosophical, psychological, or other, but this is a topic for another article. <br><br>  <b>findings</b> <br><br>  Modern companies in Russia are already showing an active interest in SaaS products.  One of the successful examples of this type was the ‚ÄúSimple Business‚Äù workflow automation complex, combining all the advantages of current SaaS products.  This is a complete SaaS solution that ensures effective management of an organization, staff, workflow, website, internal and external contacts.  Companies can use <b>‚ÄúSimple Business‚Äù</b> now: just download an agent program from the developer‚Äôs website ( <a href="http://www.prostoy.ru/">http://www.prostoy.ru</a> ), and you can start working - the staff quickly masters the program on their own.  You do not need to purchase expensive licenses, the basic options are provided free of charge.  In addition to all the listed advantages of such SaaS systems <b>, the Simple Business complex</b> contains many additional and useful functions.  For example, the agent program can work without connecting to the Internet, while maintaining access to work files and correspondence.  In addition, ‚ÄúSimple Business‚Äù allows you to train staff and receive analysis on the projects and tasks of each employee.  In general, the complex is very functional and helps to significantly improve the efficiency of solving work tasks. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/126993/">https://habr.com/ru/post/126993/</a></p>
