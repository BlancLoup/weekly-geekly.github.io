Messengers with oral messages, messengers with dispatches, optical telegraphs on towers, information transmission systems using light signals, telegraphs, telephones, mobile communications, the Internet is a continuous process necessary to satisfy the natural need of a social being in communication. <br><br>  Social networks have become the most important tools at the moment, allowing people to talk with each other, share thoughts, images, videos, broadcasts, and advertisers - to make narrowly targeted advertising on the target groups they need. <br><br>  Today we will talk about how social networks evolved during their history from 1995 to today, why and how companies benefit from using social networks, and how Vkontakte and Instagram have grown into the lives of ordinary people.

It was predicted in the XIX century, when scientists were only trying to invent a working telegraph.  Vladimir Odoyevsky in the novel ‚Äú4338 year‚Äù described something between Live Journal and Instagram.  In his world of the future between the houses is correspondence with the help of newspapers.  The senior butler, writing down the text according to the words of the house hosts, photographs it on the camera obscura and publishes it in the necessary number of copies.  Usually they report home news, different thoughts, they invite you to dinner.  For faster communication, for emergency cases, there are magnetic telegraphs between the houses. <br><br>  The author wrote his futuristic work in 1835, when a Russian diplomat and historian Paul Schilling had already assembled an electromagnetic telegraph in St. Petersburg, but Morse had <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/278850/">not yet patented</a> his version of the telegraph and had not received a subsidy for the construction of the first line. <br><br>  The fantasy of man is limitless.  Thomas Edison in 1878 described the "Telephyscope", capable of transmitting images and sound, so that relatives far from each other could communicate.  Like Vkontakte or Periscope.  But even if fantasy strides forward, it works within the limits of available technologies - they thought then with telegraph, photographs and handwritten texts. <br><br>  In the 1920s, the idea was <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/235981/">realized</a> in the Bell telephone laboratory: then the research department tested a prototype that transmitted audio and video from Washington to AT &amp; T's New York office. <br><br>  But they didn‚Äôt dream about smartphones in their pockets at that moment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e6f/f88/647/e6ff886470394d51ba1d67702c2d0fc4.png"><br>  <em>Illustration to the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãThomas Edison</em> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2ef/d6f/aeb/2efd6faeb8ab46b98ae298bfe6db1c2c.png"><br>  <em>One-way videophone developed at Bell Lab</em> <br><br>  On October 29, 1969, for the first time, a connection was established between the computers of universities in Los Angeles and Stanford.  In 1971, they developed a program for sending emails between computers.  The ARPANET network in 1973 became international - it was connected to a transatlantic telephone cable.  It allowed the exchange of information to scientific organizations in Europe and the United States.  In 1984, scientists created the NSFNet network, which united many university networks. <br><br>  The emergence of the Internet has opened up new opportunities for quick communication.  First for the military, then for the scientists, and after - for the general public.  In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee from CERN proposed the concept of the World Wide Web, developed the HTTP protocol.  In 1991, private homes were finally connected to the Internet, and not just educational institutions and military structures. <br><br>  Since 1995, you can begin the history of social networks.  The portal Classmates.com, which still exists, has become a pioneer.  It allows you to find classmates, fellow soldiers, classmates from kindergarten, work colleagues.  Over time, the developers launched versions of the site with the same design and functionality for other countries. <br><br>  In 2008, the <a href="http://www.classmates.com/">Classmates.com</a> portal had fifty million subscribers.  Of these, 3.8 million paid for membership. <br><br>  Thanks to the great love of e-mail newsletters ( <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/275802/">just like LinkedIn</a> ), the portal has become the person involved in several trials.  For example, in 2008, he paid out users $ 9.5 million. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a9f/8ce/cfa/a9f8cecfa7d5be80bbf6b9884bc7bbcc.png"><br><br>  In 2002, the previously mentioned LinkedIn appeared on the scene - a social network for business contacts.  Here it was possible to find a colleague at work or in the field of activity, to tell about their working success.  In essence, the profile is a finished resume.  The network allows you to keep track of companies that periodically post vacancies. <br><br>  Microsoft bought this social network in the summer of 2016 for $ 26.2 billion - donated a little less than a <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/277216/">third of its own cash</a> . <br><br>  The price is due to the fact that the network is actively developing and making a profit.  LinkedIn has over two million paid subscribers who can be contacted directly.  Total community has 433 million members. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e10/d9b/20b/e10d9b20bf6b7b83e5519d15214892d9.png"><br><br>  In 2003, the MySpace blogging platform appeared.  This site was originally intended for young people who want to read, listen to music, share video content, post their photos and blog.  In June 2012, attendance was 25 million people. <br><br>  MySpace has been the most popular social network in the world for several years.  But in 2008, that changed when Facebook recorded 129 million unique users, and MySpace recorded 114.6 million users. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0ca/d27/e1f/0cad27e1f0a6b5c8097ea1aceeca3156.png"><br><br>  Thefacebook site <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/245356/">opened</a> on February 4, 2004 and was available only to students at Harvard University.  For twelve years, the social network has lost the article and reached 1.71 billion active visitors per month.  Mark Zuckerberg became the youngest billionaire of the planet at 23 due to his invention. <br><br>  Initially, the network was intended for students at Harvard University.  In 2004, the audience was expanded to Stanford, Columbia University and Yale.  In September 2006, the network became open to all users over the age of thirteen. <br><br>  Facebook allows users to create their own page with photos and information, chat with friends, leave messages on the walls, upload videos and create groups, as well as company pages.  Facebook as a tool to influence the audience is used by many large corporations and local organizations.  Businessmen and politicians for reputational purposes actively use this social network. <br><br>  In April 2016, Facebook Live was launched on the social network - that is, Periscope. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4ce/9ab/34f/4ce9ab34fbd6b92c10f4d3d989458f9b.jpg"><br>  <em>Facebook Design in 2004</em> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dea/cf9/94c/deacf994cffd737c4cc4254e97b742b1.jpg"><br>  <em>Zuckerberg's Facebook Page for 2006</em> <br><br>  A similar story with the social network Vkontakte, the most popular in Russia.  On October 10, 2006, Pavel Durov launched <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061217173736/">this site</a> as a network for students and graduates. <br><br>  As of October 2016, more than 80 000 000 users log in to the social network daily.  Of these, 65% are from Russia. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/772/de4/efc/772de4efcff7504773f1df86d29d5b70.jpg"><br>  <em>Vkontakte: the beginning</em> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d48/f79/cd5/d48f79cd5e0998ccc627ab5e7904e171.jpg"><br>  <em>Design Vkontakte in 2007</em> <br><br>  Albert Popkov launched Odnoklassniki on March 26, 2005.  Prior to this, Popkov had already participated in the creation of similar projects in Europe.  In just eight months, the number of registered users reached one and a half million people, in 2007 this figure rose to four million. <br><br>  In 2008, by analogy with Classmates, a paid subscription was introduced, only this time - not for additional functions, but at the registration stage.  The popularity of the site has fallen, users have flowed in Vkontakte, and in 2010 paid registration was canceled.  In 2010, 56% of network users are people aged 25-44. <br><br>  In 2016, the social network feature appeared money transfer and streaming broadcasts, the company released the app "OK video" for Smart TV and integrated with Instagram. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/57f/3c3/292/57f3c3292dacc584f2263a24d58ef2e2.png"><br><br>  In 2006, Twitter was launched.  It was an SMS service for communicating with a small group of people.  The question ‚ÄúWhat are you doing now?‚Äù Was the main one from the very beginning.  <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/20">The first tweet</a> appeared on March 21, 2006, and was left by Jack Dorsey: ‚Äújust tuning my twttr‚Äù.  Messages on Twitter several years ago could be published from ordinary phones by sending text to the desired number for posting. <br><br>  Initially, the number of characters was limited to 140. To accommodate the link, they began to use abbreviations.  In 2016, relaxations were made - and the service <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/275942/">no longer takes into account references in the restriction</a> . <br><br>  The whole point of Twitter is to invest in these 140 characters a thought, idea, information for your friends.  Brevity is the soul of wit. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2d5/1c3/3b0/2d51c33b04127d67e1695d6b9aeba6a2.png"><br><br>  In 2010, a social network came on the scene, the chip of which is square photos, similar to Polaroid photos, and filters.  Five years after the launch, Instagram finally gave the opportunity to add photos and videos of any form. <br><br>  In 2012, Facebook bought Instagram for $ 300 million in cash and 23 million shares.  The total amount was a billion US dollars.  The bargain was surprising to some people.  But it turned out that <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/243353/">Instagram is 49 times more expensive</a> than Facebook paid for it. <br><br>  Why <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/243969/">instagram shot</a> ?  Because photography is a universal language.  Users do not even need to read the captions, because the photos processed using filters tell stories by themselves. <br><br>  During the first day after the launch of Instagram in 2010, 25 thousand people registered in it.  Given the fact that the network initially worked only on iOS.  In 2012, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced a 200 million registered user.  In December 2014, Instagram surpassed Twitter by the number of users.  On June 21, 2016, the number of users <a href="https://www.instagram.com/press/">reached</a> 500 million. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c75/ead/2d5/c75ead2d5b0d32e2c8e066ba72d9a5f9.png"><br><br>  In social networks Vkontakte and Facebook people tell stories and share thoughts.  And the authors, that is, the creators of the original content, more on Facebook.  In the Russian analogue users prefer repost. <br><br>  On Twitter, we no longer share stories, but short remarks.  Microblogging teach conciseness, forced to put thoughts into a limited number of characters. <br><br>  Instagram involves communication at a visual level.  Sometimes it's easier to take a photo or video instead of describing something in detail.  Although it is possible to share images in other networks, the narrow focus of the content on Instagram guaranteed him success. <br><br>  Users of each of these social networks communicate with each other.  And advertisers, companies and agencies, earn money by targeting advertising relevant products to the desired target groups. <br><br><h4>  Social networks for marketing </h4><br>  From the very beginning of the history of social networks, there are two ways to monetize them: advertising and paid subscriptions.  The second option did not prove to be from the best side, so today it is difficult to find a paid registration - moreover, I will not name any social network that would offer to pay for a personal account at this stage. <br><br>  Targeted advertising is actively used.  The largest brands, small and medium business - a huge number of companies have their own pages in social networks.  It helps to communicate with the audience in their language and on those platforms that are convenient for people.  And they create advertising messages for them - both for a huge number of users at the federal level, and local messages - announcements of opening a new store, discounts on goods and services in a certain city or even on the right street. <br><br>  Around social networks there are a large number of opinions regarding audiences.  Vkontakte - for schoolchildren, on Facebook - only professionals, Odnoklassniki - for senior citizens.  These assumptions are justified, but only partly. <br><br>  It is worth saying that the audiences of social networks overlap greatly - on average, there are 2.5 social networks <s>diggers</s> for each person.  And that the audience is constantly growing up with the networks. <br><br>  Below is TNS research data.  Pay attention to the proportion of users 25-34 years.  In all social networks, it ranges from 26% to 35%, and mostly people of this age use the most popular social networks, not counting Vkontakte.  Odnoklassniki is higher than the rest, the proportion of older people, and Vkontakte has a lot of users aged 18-24. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/932/10d/86c/93210d86c5c6f86e12a34f69209a0655.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/aa0/446/379/aa04463791dfa5a04084dd5ec0b3ebc0.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/faf/c8d/303/fafc8d303b94caec5505aac428dd10d4.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f2c/573/d56/f2c573d5619baa4e5ff7aafd04d54a72.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bd3/b02/f55/bd3b02f55a030541e4c1b592b264139a.png"><br><br>  Why, in principle, go to social networks in order to promote your product?  Because this channel allows you to reach a good share of the population.  In Russia, the audience of 25-34 years Vkontakte is 72% of all residents of the country.  At the age of 12-24 years, this figure reaches 84%. <br><br>  Internal advertising tools allow you to target it by user‚Äôs geography, right down to the city, by age and sex, interests, subscription to certain communities or groups - excluding group subscribers.  In Facebook and Vkontakte advertising rooms there are ‚Äúpixels‚Äù that are embedded on your website: this allows you to target ads on people who have visited the page. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/51a/9ac/da2/51a9acda22773fdb546f02e4c1654ebe.png"><br><br>  Different ways to use social networks.  If Vkontakte with desktops sit 24% of users, but in Facebook this figure is 53%.  And vice versa - 48% of the audience use Vkontakte smartphones, and Facebook - 30%.  Facebook, it is worth noting, there is a problem with the application: it <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/270344/">strongly puts the battery</a> on Android. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/406/ddd/373/406ddd3739e23c265a78dea97f2c9230.png"><br><br>  Separately worth video advertising.  To attract more advertisers, you need to tell them about the huge number of views on the sites.  Facebook used two tricks for this: automatically turning on the video while scrolling the tape and <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/280796/">overestimating video views in your own reports</a> .  Mark Zuckerberg for the second had to apologize. <br><br>  To effectively promote the desired advertiser theme, it is necessary to clearly understand what kind of audience is the target.  It‚Äôs not enough to say ‚Äúmen 18-45‚Äù are students who eat noodles poured with boiling water and businessmen in cars for several million rubles.  You need to understand the behavior of the target audience, their wealth, hobbies, marital status. <br><br>  I will give an example from classical marketing - from the book ‚ÄúNeuromarketing in action.  In immemorial times, one American airline tried to figure out how to sell airline tickets to businessmen.  As a result of the survey, they found out that men are afraid to fly not because of the fear of heights, and not even because of the fear of dying - but because of the fear of leaving the wife and child without a breadwinner.  As a result, the advertising campaign was aimed at women: do you want your husband to fly from a business trip faster?  Want to spend more time together while on vacation?  Fly on airplanes! <br><br><h4>  Penetration </h4><br>  On the penetration of social networks above, I brought a slide, which shows what percentage of the Russian population of a certain age can be covered with the help of a particular network.  Some of the people who sit on social networks in the survey may answer that they do not use the Internet - for them Odnoklassniki, for example, are not. <br><br>  In the Internet itself, social networks are integrated into a huge number of sites.  To enter the personal office of the office, which is responsible for utilities in my house, I use Vkontakte.  Sites contain news from the company's social networks, authorization via networks is configured.  The new Vkontakte tool allows you to hang up a button on the site for communicating with a company account on this social network - for convenient communication with the Customer Care service. <br><br>  The high level of network penetration is shown in real life.  Communication takes place using messages Vkontakte instead of SMS.  Although here messengers come to the forefront - as messengers from social networks like Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp, as well as Telegram, Viber.  In studies most often show the rating of social networks and instant messengers on one slide. <br><br>  A vivid example of the importance of social networks is the inheritance of accounts.  In the state of Delaver, it was <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/234147/">legalized in 2014</a> .  ‚ÄúYou died‚Äù - this is what the phrase Megan Yip, an attorney at law, gives to every client in her office in San Francisco, forcing her to take inventory of digital assets.  The audience is not only growing up, but also dying, so in this case, Facebook and other resources <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/272626/">have drawn up a plan of action for you</a> . <br><br>  Popularity of social networks contributes to the cheapening of smartphones.  Today, you can buy a decent gadget for thousands of three rubles - it is just enough to put likes on Instagram photos. <br><br>  Consumers may not call the hotline, but instead write to the manufacturer or retailer of Vkontakte.  Customer Care will come and answer the question or file a complaint - unless, of course, the company cares about its customers. <br><br>  Journalists in search of hot topics and information on the already found question are scouring social networks, various news organizations to use some photos from the scene of an accident or another incident.  They follow the accounts of managers of various companies in order to use inaccurate statements against them and their employers, to raise a wave of indignation. <br><br>  For inaccurate statements <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/264534/">can be fired, fined, imprisoned</a> .  And the easiest thing to say is something wrong in the social network, especially in a state of intoxication. <br><br>  A high penetration rate also puts people at risk.  Skirmishes and tweets fights are no longer unusual.  You can trace the movement of many people by check-ins in Swarm and Vkontakte.  In 2011, the son of Yevgeny Kaspersky was abducted, because the criminals had his home address available on the Vkontakte page. <br><br>  Social networks perfectly complement our lives.  They help people communicate, companies sell products, and researchers identify behavioral trends based on messages.  The main thing to remember is that this is not a ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù reality, but a part of real life: you will have to answer for your actions and words.  But this is another story for a future article. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/372731/">https://habr.com/ru/post/372731/</a></p>
