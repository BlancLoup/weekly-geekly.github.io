Unthinkable, isn't it?  Our life now completely depends on the power industry and nothing can be done about it.  Yes, and do not need, actually!  The development of any civilization occurs in this way.  Maybe somewhere in a galaxy far far away something else is used as energy, but in our world it is electricity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/060/2fa/ebe/0602faebed5a49c1b87a13e544b5cea2.png"><br><br>  Computers, communications, computing power of the whole world, transportation, simple household life in the end, and many more different spheres, every corner of our life is now working exclusively with the help of electricity.  Even to read the old school book, we turn on the light bulb.  But the modern world has already begun to transform, so the light bulb we turn on is necessarily energy-saving.  And indeed, the energy consumption of mankind has increased so much over the last century, that nowadays, alternative sources and methods of energy conservation are beginning to look for natural images all over the world.  After all, no one has canceled the laws of its preservation in the Universe, therefore the more we consume energy, the less it remains somewhere.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Of course, on the scale of even the solar system ... Why, even our planet, this consumption is scanty.  After all, somewhere under the earth, in water, in the sky, in space, there is concentrated such an amount of potential energy, from which scientists have a head spin.  It is logical to assume that as conquistadors for gold, all learned minds are trying to get the Grail of energy and find a safe, environmentally friendly and, most importantly, endless source of energy.  In the meantime, some people are trying to get their shrine (and we all hope that they will someday fulfill this dream), while others are providing the society with energy at this time. <br><br>  However, as practice shows, it is becoming more and more difficult to extract energy, so people became thoughtful, and decided to increase the efficiency of this process to the maximum, squeezing everything from every possible source to the last joule.  And at the same time, we must not forget how much energy we already extract is lost to empty during the processes of its transportation, consumption, etc.  Therefore, it is necessary not only to extract it more and more efficiently, but also to learn how to accumulate and store for a long time. <br><br>  Here with this in the world of man there are problems that persist, kindly, for about two decades.  During this time, no significant discoveries have been made in the field of energy storage.  Of course, in the news every now and then, yes, there will be some kind of another sensation on the topic of increasing the work of our gadgets 40 times, and all this next year, tomorrow, in a week ... But for now this remains the news: companies need investments , and the consumer remains with his short 5-7 hours on smartphones or laptops.  But hope dies last, and we are looking at the graphene developments, which are increasingly making revolutions in recent times. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9a8/fe4/b85/9a8fe4b85ab1462dadb18295c796b1bf.png"><br><h4>  Meteoenergetik </h4><br>  <i>Specialist engaged in the optimization of operating modes of generating capacity, taking into account climatic conditions.</i>  <i>Predicts the level of energy production depending on long-term weather forecasts.</i> <br><br>  More and more people pay attention to the possibility of generating energy from renewable natural resources.  And although humanity has long invented basic methods for extracting electricity from wind, water and the sun in the form of banal wind turbines and generators on the water flow, now this technology is developing in leaps and bounds. <br><br>  People try to stick windmills wherever possible.  But the snag is that not everywhere is possible, or rather, not everywhere it is really reasonable.  After all, there are many places on earth where constant winds blow, but there are also many places where there is eternal calm.  And it also happens that the wind is, that is, no.  Or is it seasonal.  The same applies to the rivers.  In some areas of our planet, rivers flow year-round, but slowly, but somewhere quickly and only at certain times of the year.  Climatic conditions on Earth are not constant, although in general they are regular.  Our weather forecasts are still limited to only 3 days with a probability of approximately 90%.  Further, the probability of a correct forecast decreases exponentially. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f05/c92/764/f05c927646ee45bba729e074e21c8ce7.jpg"><br><br>  However, at the same time, we can predict global phenomena fairly well based on statistical information.  However, this is also not an innovation, and with a technological explosion in the development of our civilization, we only learned to better collect statistics and process it.  But this is exactly what helps to significantly increase the efficiency of electricity production from nature.  Now we can not just say that in such and such a period it will rain and be windy, but rather accurately foresee how much precipitation will fall and how strong the wind will be.  And on the basis of these readings, it is already possible to understand precisely whether the installation of a hydroelectric power plant here will be beneficial and whether the surrounding windmill will provide the surrounding houses with the necessary amount of energy. <br><br>  The volume of this work only increases with time.  And as is usually the case, they force the market to create a new profession, such as Meteenergetik, which, in fact, deals with all the miscalculations, estimates, analysis and optimization of systems that depend on the unstable climate of our planet.  This specialty is mostly based on the analysis of data already collected, and therefore is not as difficult to master as many others.  And it will require a person to master the tools of analytics and programming.  However, the profession is still a narrow specialty and, undoubtedly, there will be a need to deeply understand two branches: meteorology and energy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f53/208/8ae/f532088aee9e41e392a5c930797b5fcf.png"><br><h4>  Specialist in local energy saving systems </h4><br>  <i>It is engaged in the development, implementation and maintenance of systems of low power generation (wind, solar, bio, atomic microgenerators, etc.).</i> <br><br>  If the previous profession dealt directly with the climatic dependencies of energy extraction from meteorological conditions, here we will talk about a more global specialty.  As mentioned earlier, every single corner of the planet has its own characteristics.  And for each of them their own unique methods of obtaining energy are suitable.  Somewhere it is easier to work with windmills, and somewhere it is easier to put a nuclear power plant.  The effectiveness of each method must be calculated separately, and then compared.  There are situations when it is better to apply some kind of combined solutions.  All this should be analyzed and taken into account, and correct conclusions should be made. <br><br>  The profession "Specialist in local energy saving systems" essentially exists now.  Rather, in the form of an on-site employee, who is in place and gives his recommendations, but only about the technologies that are used in his company.  Over time, this position will grow into something more global, and such people will be able to solve this issue on a larger scale.  Such a specialist will be able to aggregate all available information on a particular site, collect the missing, analyze it and make miscalculations for all types of existing energy production technologies.  In this case, such a person should not simply rely on the numbers and give the calculated result to the client.  It will require good communication.  After all, it is possible that the customer simply does not have the opportunity to purchase and install what you offer.  Therefore, a professional should think in terms of efficiency, taking into account the capabilities of the customer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fdd/c91/6d7/fddc916d70f94b839a973cb2383ecf62.jpg"><br><br>  For example, a remote farm, which supplies electricity from a city power plant, costs a decent portion of its income, has thought about increasing the efficiency of its energy resources.  Having considered all possible methods to reduce energy consumption, such a specialist can offer a number of solutions.  You can put several inexpensive wind turbines to cover part of the electricity consumed by all the production devices.  And you can also install a bioreactor that produces gas or liquid fuel from raw materials, which in the farm just enough.  In addition, the choice of a liquid-fuel bioreactor can also cover the cost of fuel for agricultural equipment. <br><br>  So such a specialist will require an understanding of all the technologies in the field of energy generation and economy.  The need to offer a range of solutions and convince customers of the effectiveness of certain aspects of each of them will require high communication skills.  Well, the process of developing such complex systems will require a specialist and not lesser skills in the possession of specialized software tools and systems thinking. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4dd/7f0/0a5/4dd7f00a56284b8aac65814ceeab962b.png"><br><h4>  Recuperation system designer </h4><br>  <i>Specialist in technological solutions for "capturing" the excess energy of moving vehicles, especially when braking, for example, road transport, metro, city electric transport.</i> <br><br>  Energy production is definitely good.  And the more we develop it, the greater the opportunities for technological development before us are opened.  But there is such a very correct saying, which, although about money, fits very well into our coordinate system of the narrative: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not the one who earns much, but the one who spends little.‚Äù Teravatty energy can be produced every second, but if we spend we no longer, no electricity generation technology will help us.  Therefore, for about more than half a century, mankind has been working hard to increase the efficiency of all its systems in order to reduce consumption. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/258/f60/ad8/258f60ad88bb49ec91cffe2b2068416c.jpg"><br><br>  This, of course, is also good, but what about the losses that occur directly during energy consumption?  To take the same cars: to go - energy is needed, to stop - energy is also needed.  Somehow it is not logical. <br><br>  That is why recovery technologies are already emerging.  This is when we return some of the energy that we have spent on some kind of action.  And these technologies are now actively developing.  So far, mainly in the automotive industry, but it is logical to assume that soon it will find application in all transport.  In fact, recovery technology can be applied absolutely everywhere where the cyclic principle of operation is applicable.  A system that starts mechanical work by wasting energy can certainly give up part of it when it stops. <br><br>  This sphere is not yet as well studied as the others, but the direction is given.  Therefore, ‚ÄúDesigners of recovery systems‚Äù will soon appear, who will be able to develop all the new possibilities of using technologies in our life.  This is an interesting job that requires everything else to be creative. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2fc/d49/aa6/2fcd49aa6f724080b7c4d6ada8bb4931.png"><br><h4>  Power Generation System Modernization Manager </h4><br>  <i>Manages the modernization of power plants: CHP, hydro, nuclear power plants;</i>  <i>introduces modern methods of safety, environmental friendliness and resource efficiency.</i> <br><br>  In the world there are a huge number of types of power plants, which differ in both the type of fuel and the type of power plants used in them.  Most stations operate on the principle of converting chemical energy into mechanical energy.  Even permanently present at the hearing of the station for the production of clean energy (windmills, hydroelectric stations, solar stations) also mostly work on the principle of generating electricity from mechanical stress.  You can‚Äôt do anything with this, for now we are only at this level of development. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/be0/b2d/5e7/be0b2d5e78394e4382c17c019fb55d09.jpg"><br><br>  But all these types of energy production are united by one thing: equipment.  There is no eternity in our world, including for the very equipment.  And no matter how durable the generators are, they wear out over time.  Therefore, it is not surprising that there is such a profession as "Manager for the modernization of power generation systems."  Even when we may be able to curb thermonuclear energy, such a person will still fail. <br><br>  And this profession is not new!  You can even say that it is one of the oldest in this area.  Even when the water was extracted from a water mill wheel, there were people who could help you repair this structure and even improve it.  So it happens now: old equipment is replaced by new.  But nowadays there are still differences that will increasingly appear in the future.  If earlier the engineer of the general spectrum was engaged in it, now it has become a unique profession, where many of its features and difficulties. <br>  The process of modernization of power plants is not new and began long before the birth of many readers here.  Engineers have always sought to more effectively manage available resources.  And now, when many technologies have long been tested and provide stable indicators of increased efficiency, they need to be implemented. <br><br>  For example, Siemens already has a whole division that offers services for the modernization of various thermal power plants, hydroelectric power plants and any other systems where energy is generated.  And since the number of such facilities only grows with time, the need for this profession will certainly only be higher.  And in this case, a person needs a very high knowledge of the field of energy, all engineering systems and methods of working with it.  This is a very narrowly specialized profession, and mastering it means getting a good education.  And, of course, in this specialization a person will need all the qualities of an attentive and respectable engineer who will think not just about installing a new system, but also about making such a system as efficient and economical as possible for specific conditions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/315/146/15f/31514615f6d245a981ebfe74d3fc961d.png"><br><h4>  Microgeneration System Developer </h4><br>  <i>Specialist in the development and design of new technological solutions related to energy microgeneration to the user's requirements.</i> <br><br>  Along with the huge energy-generating stations that provide electricity to the city and the country, people are increasingly thinking about generating a small amount of electricity at a miniature level.  For example, one breath of a person can give about 1W of energy, and on average a person takes as many as 23 thousand breaths per day.  And if you use energy when walking, you can even power a regular incandescent lamp, which is already talking about a smartphone.  Almost all of us are already inseparable from computers, phones and other micro-electronics.  Which, in fact, does not require such huge reserves of electricity.  And, of course, more and more often engineers are thinking about how a person can provide for his small needs on his own.  This will significantly reduce the growth of the load on the power plant and in general optimizes energy consumption. <br><br>  Basically, this area applies to everything where a person acts.  Everything related to nature - we are already fully mastered.  But traditionally, a person is accustomed to seeing his own body and the sphere of life as a consumer, rather than as a source of electricity.  Therefore, now this area is completely new for the energy sector and extremely promising.  It may seem to you that the production of a couple of hundred watts of your own body per day does not have a significant value.  However, if you transfer this value to an average city of a couple of hundred thousand people, then you can save on traditional electricity consumption up to 7.5 TW per year - you will agree, the numbers are already serious. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fa0/87b/a9f/fa087ba9fbcc43c7acedfcc8cf63a4ec.jpg"><br><br>  But, as it might seem to you, it is not necessary to consider this direction as special T-shirts or underwear with USB ports.  By no means.  For example, in Tokyo for the production of energy using turnstiles in the subway.  In the year this metro carries more than 3 billion passengers, and each of them at least twice turns the turnstile at the entrance and exit.  Even if each turn of the turnstile produces only 1 MW of energy, then in sum it is already 6 MW, which is basically enough to feed partially all the stations. <br><br>  The development of this area is extremely interesting, because it opens up tremendous opportunities.  And, of course, soon enough, there will be developers who will specialize in this particular energy industry.  The demand for them will be high, as there are countless spheres of application for such technologies.  However, these people will need a high knowledge of their specifics.  This should be not just a creative imagination, but also an understanding of technology at a deep level.  The ability to approach work systematically is also not at all superfluous.  Therefore, we recommend those who wish to become such a developer, now prepare for this.  Just higher education is hardly enough, so strive to learn more. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2a3/927/2c3/2a39272c3c3c4d57b9c7dc17124bda65.png"><br><h4>  Wearable Power Designer </h4><br>  <i>Designer wearable power devices - designer of mobile / wearable generating systems, is engaged in the creation of goods for individual use (clothes, shoes, etc.) with the function of micro-generation of energy.</i> <br><br>  This profession is rather a logical continuation of the previous one in one of the industries.  After all, you can not just fasten a bunch of equipment to a person and convince them that this will save energy and generate free electricity.  A person needs attention, beauty and encouragement of the sense of beauty.  What you are going to put on a man should be a little different from the clothes for a woman.  Sneakers that add a couple of watts of energy to your smartphone should not look like miner's rubber boots, and these women's pants that collect residual body heat and charge the laptop in the bag should not be just black. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c16/beb/e4a/c16bebe4a41247109722a6005da7670f.jpg"><br><br>  Fashion in our world exists for a reason.  Someone says that it is constantly changing and it is impossible to keep track of trends.  Someone argues that everything repeats in a spiral, with only minor changes, but a common base.  However, one cannot argue with the fact that the devices that people will wear should be aesthetically pleasing and thoughtful.  If it takes half an hour to put on a special energy-generating coveralls, no one in their right mind will buy it for everyday life and this technology will fail before entering the market. <br>  That is why the profession of "Designer wearable device" is extremely important.  Any technology, no matter how excellent, should be commercially viable.  Namely, this is where designers help: to convince the buyer that he wants it.  Of course, no one has canceled ardent fanatics and "green" who buy any technology, even if it ruins their lives.  But such people are units and they cannot ensure commercial success. <br><br>  However, not every designer can just do this kind of work.  We'll have to do a good job in many industries, including directly in micro-energy technologies.  Well, in general, all the same skills that modern designers have are saved here.  By the way, some of them are already taking the first steps in this profession, inventing the appearance and ergonomics of the first wearable generating devices.  So do not miss your time, this specialization will become relevant very soon. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9b5/d58/176/9b5d58176ba04ada8f3b091dbbc56be3.png"><br><h4>  Energy Storage Designer </h4><br>  <i>Designer of energy storage systems: high-capacity batteries, heat accumulators, flywheels, etc., which allow you to save energy for redistribution in ‚Äúsmart grids‚Äù between peaks and falls.</i> <br><br>  From all that we have listed above, we only hooked the topic of the accumulation of energy.  Unfortunately, in this area, technologies are not evolving so rapidly, and you can even say that we are in a certain period of stagnation of energy storage.  And by the way this is one of the most important topics today.  Scientists from all forces are fighting over the creation of new high-capacity batteries. <br><br>  But in this area is not so simple as it might seem at first glance.  After all, there are quite a few ways to accumulate energy and all of them were already invented long before us.  It is just that the chemical elements of the accumulation of electricity are widely spread in the modern world and we practically hear nothing about mechanical, thermal and other accumulation systems. <br><br>  And right now, this industry is beginning to pay attention to the past.  With modern technology and development, many developments of already dead scientists can get a second wind.  Moreover, humanity is increasingly talking about creating a global network of energy conservation.  Today, someone has full batteries, and another person has empty ones.  Naturally, it is much more effective to redistribute opportunities between all.  In the meantime, companies like Tesla are already creating the germs of such networks through their developments.  These are also energy storage devices, but in a larger sense. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/083/53c/775/08353c775de549b58ccb72cffb37c9a4.jpg"><br><br>  All this needs to be designed.  Therefore, the profession of ‚ÄúEnergy Storage Designer‚Äù profession will appear soon.  An engineering view of the world, systems thinking and, of course, high management and programming skills.  Such a person is more like the Team-lead or the Information Systems Architect, but in this case he will also need a deep understanding of energy within networks and storage. <br><br>  Energy is a very important part of our life.  And the more we develop, the more important for our society will be the people who give us such important food for life in the form of electricity.  Most of these specialties already exist in their infancy.  But the energy sector is still developing at a pace that is not as high as the others: many significant technological breakthroughs that still work today have been made 20-30 years ago.  Therefore, the development of professions occurs at a slower pace.  But this does not mean that there will be no development in our lifetime.  Not at all.  After 15-20 years, you will not recognize the energy industry and will remember today's times as the terrible horror of ancient technologies. <br><br>  <a href="http://atlas100.ru/">Read more about the future professions on the website of the atlas of new professions</a> <a href="http://atlas100.ru/"><br></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365727/">https://habr.com/ru/post/365727/</a></p>
