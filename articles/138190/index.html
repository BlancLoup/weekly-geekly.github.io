Immediately throw it in the trash - this weekend it will not help you and your plans will be brutally disrupted!  Ask why?  And all because the event is coming, which is not to be missed! <br><br>  We are talking about the <b>World Hackathon on Android development</b> , an event covering our entire earth globe.  The event is organized by more than fifty GTUGs, here they are: <a href="http://bit.ly/androidhackathonmap">bit.ly/androidhackathonmap</a> .  These days, <b>February 18-19, 2012</b> , thousands of developers on android will gather to try to <s>catch the fish of their dreams</s> in 48 hours <s>to</s> develop the application of their dreams, with the support of the global community, Google engineers and GTUG colleagues. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Developers, the Moscow GTUG team offers you to take an active part in this global event!  The plan for the hackathon is at the very end of the announcement.  <b>The venue will be known tonight.</b>  Option two - or Google office on the street.  Baltschug, 7, or the business incubator of the Academy of National Economy on the metro station Yugo-Zapadnaya.  Keep for updates.  Meals are provided to participants (electric for laptops, informational for the Internet via Wi-Fi, pizza for coders) :) Register here: <a href="http://bit.ly/mosgtughackandroid">http://bit.ly/mosgtughackandroid</a>

    <h4>  And now the information for those who would like to, but doubts </h4><br><ul><li>  You can program, but under the android have not yet coded? </li><li>  You have no team experience? </li><li>  Do you have a project that you have long wanted to implement, but you didn‚Äôt have enough time or a team of smart guys? </li><li>  You want to learn more about the development of Android applications, but are afraid to ask? </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Ha ha!</b>  But all this is not a reason for you not to come!  And that's why: <br><ul><li>  When you participate in the hackathon, you will be able to learn the skill of development from the more experienced colleagues who came to the hackathon, realize that it is not so difficult and scary, and start programming for android. </li><li>  Where else, if not on the hackathon, can you gain experience in a team and see how others do it? </li><li>  World practice shows the extreme effectiveness of hakatons.  Many can confirm that by participating in the hackathon in one or two days they have done a huge part of the work on the project, which under normal conditions would have done a month or more.  All this is due to the high concentration of technically savvy and enthusiastic people in one place, ready to help each other. </li><li>  This is a great opportunity to assemble your own team, which will be useful outside the hackathon for your crazy ideas :) </li><li>  In support of those who are unable to come up with a project for themselves or consider that the task alone is beyond their ability, we will organize a separate GTUG team for beginners, with which we will complete the selected project.  Everyone will put their hand to create a project and at the same time absorb the knowledge of the rest! </li><li>  Come to the dark side, we have cookies.  Only our side is not dark, but light and creatively positive, and instead of cookies is pizza. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Extra </h4><br>  For those to whom the usual coding under Android seems a little, we have provided several additional options for activity: <br><ul><li>  If you know, there is such a thing as ADK.  This is a device based on Arduino, which allows you to connect to the android a bunch of various sensors, external devices, etc.  You can make at least a robot from the phone that can find its way in the maze using the light sensors / sonar / gravitational detectors.  or make a universal remote control for smart home.  Everything is limited only by your imagination.  ( <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/usb/adk.html">http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/usb/adk.html</a> ) This fall at the GDD 2011 was the final of the competition for the ADK, you could see the projects made by jitaggers based on it.  Alexey Isachenko will bring an ADK board, a set of sensors and sensors, a circuit board, etc. to the hackathon.  so that you, our technomaniacs, can experiment with them as part of your project. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/69b/8ff/efd/69b8ffefd2122bf256e0f46e213b98e9.jpg" alt="image"><br>  If we manage to coordinate the event with amperka.ru, then the best team will receive the ADK itself as a prize. </li><li>  Dreamed of creating your flying helicopter (quadcopter) in childhood?  Well, now you can buy such a device in the store and you can not bother much.  But now you have a new goal?  Do you dream to write software for Android with Augmented Reality technology (embedded reality) to control this quadcopter?  If until Thursday we can recruit 10-12 people who are interested in the hacking of Ardrone Parrot (http://ardrone.parrot.com), for which there is no official Android API yet, then Alexey Isachenko will bring this device to the hackathon. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/18e/7cc/6a6/18e7cc6a6cf417815c7f713ebc8c63c4.jpg" alt="image"></li></ul><br><br><h4>  Links for self-study </h4><br>  Here are some materials to make you more prepared for the hackathon: <br>  International hackathon website: <a href="http://android-dev-camp-2012.blogspot.com/">http://android-dev-camp-2012.blogspot.com/</a> <br>  <a href="http://developer.android.com/index.html">developer.android.com/index.html</a> <br>  CIS GTUGS: <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/101112261338293610652/">plus.google.com/u/0/b/101112261338293610652</a> <br>  MosGTUG Group: <a href="http://bit.ly/mosgtug">bit.ly/mosgtug</a> <br><br><h4>  Hackathon plan: </h4><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  <b>Time</b> </td><td>  <b>Description</b> </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>18th of Febuary</b> </td><td>  <b>Saturday</b> </td></tr><tr><td>  10:00 - 10:10 </td><td>  Opening hakaton.
