Video, MARS Chocolate and Kaspersky talked about the eternal: ‚ÄúHow to find and understand your ts.a.  and make the most effective contact with the consumer? " <br>  We have connected the main ideas and trends for you in this article. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2db/14b/0d6/2db14b0d6c824c6fa98f88472182e4b8.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  On March 16-18, 2016, the largest business forum <a href="http://marketing.dnbd.su/%3Futm_source%3Dia%26utm_medium%3Dposr%26utm_campaign%3Dp">Dive In Marketing 2016</a> was held on the campus of the Moscow School of Management SKOLKOVO, as well as online throughout Russia and the CIS. <br>  The event was held with the support of the Government of Moscow. <br>  <a href="http://cashmyvisit.com/%3Futm_source%3DmegamozgDIM%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3DCashMyVisit">We have</a> combined all the most interesting reports in 5 topics, turning them into a squeeze of the main trends of the sales and marketing market in 2016, supported by quotes from leading experts in their field. <br><br><h4>  About consumption </h4><br><blockquote>  In America, 55% (from 2010 to 2013) fell indicators on shopping trips, but sales increased by 9% (c) Yuri Berchenko, Google Russia. </blockquote><br>  This was facilitated by the Internet and the ability of a person to study several products and points of sale in a short period of time.  Here is a study confirming this hypothesis. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d12/8aa/b6d/d128aab6dd1648e98d8a4ee1a4b7be52.jpg"><br>  In 2016, in order for a person to become a client, you need to put more effort into it.  Since the consumer simply will not go for the product, if he has a high price, but there is cheaper.  This rule applies to both inexpensive products of mass consumption and expensive goods.

      Also interesting is the Google study about buying a car, in which 6 thousand residents of Russia took part.  By results, on average: <br><ul><li>  103 days spent by the buyer to find a car. </li><li>  Used 7 sources of information. </li><li>  94% use the Internet in search. </li><li>  To study the car you like, a person needs, in total: 8 h 21 m. </li><li>  During the search were used: 14 unique sites;  51 search queries. </li><li>  86% of the sites studied are search results. </li><li>  Used: 93% - laptops;  38% - tablets;  43% - smartphone;  20% - all devices. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  About buyers </h4><br><blockquote>  The buyer has many faces, lies, spoiled.  Focus polls show lies in 30% of cases, and this is the bottom bar of the indicator (c) Nicholas Caro, ‚ÄúRCB &amp; B‚Äù. </blockquote><br>  Not positive statistics.  But to know the key data is realistic, if you focus on the indicators obtained with a larger sample, after numerous tests. <br>  For example, we know for sure that, firstly, in <b>0.9</b> seconds a person understands where he needs to go and what to do.  That is, for these fractions of a second, the buyer should ‚Äúhook‚Äù on a picture or text, i.e.  Get on your ad magnet. <br><br>  Secondly, within <b>2 minutes</b> after contact with advertising, the consumer feels a state of hyper-involvement that passes 20 minutes later. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8be/258/eb4/8be258eb44794988bf0153b0a035f194.jpg"><br>  Increasing customer loyalty in this phase is especially important for high value products for consumers (the segment is above average).  On increasing loyalty in the auto business <a href="https://spark.ru/startup/cashmyvisit/blog/8597/na-chto-vliyaet-komfort-kak-callback-vidzhet-pomog-povisit-loyalnost-pokupatelej">here</a> . <br>  These facts should be taken into account in time to create a product, website and advertising. <br><br><blockquote>  Any marketer can calculate the conversion, lead cost and advertising campaign.  Questions arise after, at the moment when you need to understand what to do with this knowledge (c) Sergey Solsky, ‚ÄúIT Business Idea‚Äù. </blockquote><br>  To quickly collect and analyze data, even a small business should connect and use a CRM system.  It will help in the analysis of the business plan, or rather, to understand where the buyer came from, how long the sales path took and what is the average life cycle of the client. <br>  With the data collected, it will be easier for you to segment your audience, which will help increase profits.  Having solved the customer's way, you can put more magnets to attract him, leading to the sale. <br><br>  <b>Since Megamozg does not allow placing the full version of the article, read more about promotion, brands and partnerships <a href="https://spark.ru/startup/cashmyvisit/blog/14466/v-skolkovo-sostoyalsya-krupnejshij-forum-po-kompleksnomu-marketingu">here</a> .</b> <br><br><h5>  Promotional PS </h5><br><br>  We guarantee that we will provide high-quality feedback for your site‚Äôs customers, complete reporting on the system‚Äôs operation, we‚Äôll collect and deliver all the collected requests from the site to you 24/7. <br>  We give 7 days of free <a href="http://cashmyvisit.com/%3Futm_source%3DmegamozgDIM%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3DCashMyVisit">test</a> and 2000 rubles to the account to make sure of it! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299668/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299668/</a></p>
