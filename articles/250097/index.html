Prior to this, all servers were unavailable for two days, so the actual backup could not be made.  Yes, by the way, the backup on their site was also safely destroyed. <br><br><blockquote>  <b>Dear users, as a result of a hardware failure, all data of virtual machines, including their backups, was lost.</b>  <b>And as a result, we had to delete all the virtual machines in the cloud</b> .

      <br>
      At the moment, we found a point of failure and corrected it.  In the future, this situation will not happen again, since we found the source of the problems and took measures. <br><br>  Our project is already six months.  We have more than 22,000 registered users.  We ourselves develop the control panel and cloud infrastructure.  During this time, we have gained tremendous experience and constantly introduce new and modern solutions. <br><br>  Yes, those who are with us from the very beginning may notice that at first the uptime of the servers was low, but in recent months the situation has changed for the better and they have become available at any time. <br><br>  We apologize, and we understand that as a result of this, many of your projects did not work and many of them would take time to recover.  We are sincerely sorry and of course we understand the whole scale of the tragedy.  We made a lot of conclusions, and a lot has changed in the work of the cloud. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In other words, from today for version cloudmouse 2.0 is available, and in it all errors, bugs, data loss - fixed! <br><br>  At the moment, all the technical work has been completed, we have changed a lot in the cloud architecture to guarantee the stability and reliability of your virtual servers. <br><br>  We also increased the speed of the virtual servers, about 10-40 times compared with those that were before.  Despite the tragedy with the loss of data, we continue to work on the project. <br><br>  Believe us once again, what happened once, we won‚Äôt happen again, we fixed mistakes and got a great experience that will help us in the future to avoid any such problems. <br><br>  Create new servers, if you need help in setting up, write us a ticket. <br><br>  Once again we apologize to you, and we assure that this is a hardware-software error and we have fixed it. <br><br>  Respectfully, <br>  CloudMouse development team </blockquote><br><br>  Apparently they don‚Äôt want to return the money, because technical support on this issue is silent. <br><br>  Who thinks what?  Someone else server suffered from such updates? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/250097/">https://habr.com/ru/post/250097/</a></p>
