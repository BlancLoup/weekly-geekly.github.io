  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Haiku OS has just been released - R1 / Alpha 3</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Although with a delay, the regular test release of Haiku OS - R1 / Alpha 3 took place. <br><br> <a href="http://haiku-os.org/get-haiku"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/a7b2f007/48e20d9b/c62ba80c/1b8d8427.png" alt="image"><br></a> <br><br>  Below are the notes for the third official release of Haiku R1 Alpha 3. While working on the release, Haiku developers sought to make it more stable, to provide more options for both end users and developers, to increase the chances of successful loading on a wider range of equipment. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We tried very hard to make this release as good as possible.  However, there are a few problems and unrealized opportunities, some of which are listed below.  Please do not forget that this is still an alpha release: it is incomplete and contains known and unknown errors.  Although we are confident in the stability of this release, we can not give any guarantee against data loss.

      <br>
      Another goal that led to the release of Alpha 3 is to provide current and future Haiku developers with an updated and (overall) stable operating system to work on their programs. <br><br>  Therefore, we have included the main developer tools, along with CVS, SVN, Git, and Hg clients.  This release of Haiku allows you to build and run executable files using GCC2 and GCC4.  If the use of GCC4 is not necessary, it should be discarded, since compatibility with the API in future versions of Haiku is not guaranteed. <br><br>  <b>System requirements</b> <br><br>  At the moment, Haiku works only on x86 ‚Äì systems.  The minimum amount of RAM is 128 MiB.  For assembling Haiku from under itself, 1 GiB is recommended. <br><br>  <b>New features</b> <br><br>  Consider briefly some of the most important improvements and additions to Haiku, which appeared since the previous release of R1 Alpha 2. It should be noted that after its release, more than 950 errors have been fixed.  In addition, more than 250 subtle bugs found using Coverity have been fixed. <br><br><ul><li>  Improved reading (and write support) for various file systems, such as btrfs, exFAT, ext2, ext3, ext4, NTFS, UDF and others. </li><li>  Various hardware support enhancements: IO ‚Äì APIC, ACPI, drivers for video cards, network cards and USB. </li><li>  Use Guttenprint to provide additional support for printers. </li><li>  Partial font overlay support.  For example, some Japanese and Chinese characters are now displayed. </li><li>  Improved support for encoding and decoding in MediaKit. </li><li>  Added General MIDI SoundFont, created by Tim Brechbill, adds MIDI support to many applications. </li><li>  New IMAP implementation.  Now the letters are synchronized with the server, and not just downloaded as in POP3. </li><li>  Rewrote mail daemon replacement (MDR) and parts of Mail Kit.  Fixed MDR crashes. </li><li>  StackAndTile integration, originally developed at the University of Auckland (available through setdecor SATDecorator).  More clearly <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/HaikuB0t">on this video</a> . </li><li>  Added support for moving and resizing windows (CTRL + CMD + first mouse button and CTRL + CMD + second mouse button). </li><li>  Update the second experimental supported compiler to GCC version 4.4.4 (available via setgcc gcc4). </li><li>  Support for weak characters and interrupt characters in GCC 4. </li><li>  The graphical interface has been revised in several programs: BootManager, DiskUsage, MediaPlayer, ReadOnlyBootPrompt and ShowImage. </li><li>  Extended locale support.  Single backend for Haiku API and POSIX locale API.  The interface and stability of the Locale and Time preflets are greatly improved. </li><li>  Layout API is used in more applications, which makes their interface more responsive to changing fonts and localization.  In addition, the Layout API is approaching to become stable and public.  However, the API is not yet complete: it can change at any time.  We draw the attention of developers to this. </li><li>  Implementing support for PAE (Physical Address Extension) that makes physical memory above 4 GiB available. </li></ul><br>  <b>Missing features</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Haiku still does not support WPA encryption for wireless networks.  Only WEP encryption is supported. </li><li>  The package manager is under development and is not included in this release.  A script allowing to install a small set of software (available through the installoptionalpackage) is included as a temporary replacement. </li><li>  USB keyboards connected to an OHCI or USB 2.0 hub do not work in kernel debugging mode (KDL).  To function, they must be connected to the UHCI port.  Also note that when entering the kernel debugger due to panic, it is possible that the keyboard will not work.  To work around this problem, you can manually switch to kernel debug mode and exit.  After these actions, the USB keyboard will work. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Known Issues</b> <br><br><ul><li>  LiveCD performance and the duration of the first boot: after the initial installation of the system or boot in LiveCD mode, some background tasks are performed to complete the installation process.  This is known to lead to poor performance.  For a hard disk, this problem does not occur, because tasks are performed quickly.  In LiveCD mode, performance is noticeably reduced due to the low search speed on the CD.  Since the CD-ROM works in read-only mode, this installation happens every time the LiveCD starts.  On the recordable media, the installation will take place only once and there will be no delay on the next boot. </li><li>  Font rendering, despite the expiration of a hinting patent, is still not optimal.  Due to the uncertain situation with patents in official release, the code falling under the action of patents is disabled.  Unfortunately, this code also includes subpixel anti-aliasing used in FreeType.  As soon as the situation clears up, sub-pixel anti-aliasing will be returned to the official releases. </li><li>  ACPI support, enabled by default, can lead to problems on some hardware.  You can disable ACPI in the safe mode options in the bootloader. </li><li>  Copying large amounts of data from a faster to a slow disk (for example, a USB disk) may result in the use of a paging file. </li><li>  It is reported that the Haiku bootloader may hang on some systems. </li><li>  The work on localization / internationalization support is not yet complete.  Some applications are partially translated and have problems with long lines in languages ‚Äã‚Äãother than English. </li><li>  To install the firmware of some wireless network cards, user confirmation is required.  Such cards are Broadcom 43xx, Intel ipw2100, Intel ipw2200 and Marvell 88W8335.  As a temporary solution to the problem, a script is used (available via install-wifi ‚Äìfirmwares.sh) </li></ul><br>  <b>Source</b> <br><br>  The source code for Haiku itself, optional packages, and components required for building (with the exception of closed source projects) are available for download at: <a href="http://www.haiku-files.org/files/releases/r1alpha3/sources/">www.haiku-files.org/files/releases/r1alpha3/sources</a> <br><br>  <b>Error reports</b> <br><br>  To date, about 2,000 tickets are left open in the Haiku Error Tracker, 5,000 are closed.
