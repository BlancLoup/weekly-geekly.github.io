Unknown lighter or harder.  There are given lever scales that show that the load on one side is heavier.  For 3 weighing you need to find a fake coin. <br><br>  From experience, I advise you not to hurry, to decide in writing.  The puzzle ‚Äú12 coins, 3 weighings‚Äù appeared several times in my life.  The first time I was asked by my fellow Olympiad, I decided it after the Olympiad, and I had a couple of hours to break my head.  And after a few years it was not immediately given to me.  If you want to decide for yourself - do it on a piece of paper. <br><br>  Below will be an analysis and solution stages.  The stages will be carried out according to a universal method of solving problems, which is applicable both to programming and to life.  Thanks to the approach, solving the puzzle will be easy. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I suggest you before reading to suggest a solution.  Do you have an answer?  Tested?

      If it were the software questions would be the following: ‚ÄúHave you programmed, tested the algorithm?  Considered test cases and checked them? ". <br><br>  Experience shows that to solve it is required to draw a decision tree and check all 12 cases. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ea/6b/20/ea6b20h3z2v8we64yxscyvzfls4.png" alt="image"><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">1. Tips</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <b>In the process of solving will help:</b> <br><br>  1) Reduction of entropy (measure of uncertainty) and answers to the questions: <br><br><ul><li>  What did you learn in the previous step? </li><li>  What reduces uncertainty? </li><li>  What information do we have? </li><li>  What else do you need to know? </li></ul><br>  Questions are suitable for any task projects.  Answers to them help in reducing the risks of missed deadlines, overspending the budget and getting a ouster from the authorities. <br><br>  2) Decomposition.  Approach from simple to complex.  If you prepare a solution to the simplest cases, then use them to solve the problem (divide and conquer algorithm), it will be easier than to imagine the whole situation in your head. <br><br>  <i>The divide-and-conquer algorithms divide a task into two or more subtasks of the same type, but smaller to elementary tasks, and combine their solutions to get an answer to the original problem.</i> <br><br>  Compose questions for decomposition.  What would you suggest? <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">2. Decomposition</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <b>What questions have you formulated for decomposition?</b>  <b>Any coincidences?</b> <br><br>  1) What is the most elementary situation?  What can we do in one weighing? <br><br>  For one weighing we can determine which coin is heavier, whether the weight of the coins is equal. <br><br>  2) If we have 2 coins, and, as we know, fake is heavier or lighter.  How to determine a fake one weighing? <br><br>  It is necessary to weigh the coins, and to determine the false one, depending on the arrow of the scale. <br><br>  3) If we have 2 coins, and, it is not known, a fake is heavier or easier, how to determine a false one in one weighing? <br><br>  After weighing one of the 2 presented coins with the third coin, about which it is known that it is genuine. <br><br>  4) If we have 3 coins, and it is known that a fake is heavier or lighter.  How to determine a fake one weighing? <br><br>  It is necessary to compare any two of these coins, if they are equal, the third coin is a false one. <br><br>  5) If we have 3 coins, and, unknown, a fake is heavier or lighter.  Is it possible to determine a fake one weighing? <br><br>  Unfortunately not. <br><br>  6) If we have 4 coins, and is it unknown if a fake is heavier or lighter, can we identify a false one at the same time? <br><br>  Unfortunately not. <br><br>  7) If we have 4 coins, and, unknownly, a fake is heavier or lighter, for how many weighings can we determine a false one? <br><br>  For two weighing. <br><br>  Further from the elementary cases we will collect situations from 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 coins.  How do you see the solution? <br><br>  Below is the complete solution. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">3. Decision</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The first step: divide the coins into 3 groups of 4: 1 2 3 4, 5 6 7 8, 9 10 11 12. <br><br>  Compare the first two groups.  There are three options: <br><br><ol><li>  the first group is heavier; </li><li>  the second group is heavier; </li><li>  are equal. </li></ol><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_c/kn/42/_ckn42_1csdqnqb54orm_za_era.png" alt="image"><br><br>  1) If the groups are equal, then the counterfeit coin is in the third group.  It is necessary to find a fake coin of 4 coins for two weighings. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oo/a7/ci/ooa7ci9jzy0-61ltyptlvbrya_8.png" alt="image"></div><br><br>  Divide the third group into two: 9 10 11 12 <br><br>  Compare 9 and 10: <br><br><ul><li>  if they are equal, then a fake coin in the second group - we compare 9 and 11. If 9 and 11 are equal, then a false one - 12, if not -11 </li><li>  if they are not equal, then fake in the first group - we compare 10 and 12. If 10 and 12 are equal - fake - 9, if not - 10. </li></ul><br>  So we found a fake coin. <br><br>  2) Consider the second case.  If the first group is heavier than the second, then we assign the first character ‚Äú&gt;‚Äù, the second group ‚Äú&lt;‚Äù, the third group - ‚Äú0‚Äù. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/o8/5l/px/o85lpxxhc9114yny3vy3hhhvmou.png" alt="image"></div><br><br>  We divide the coins into groups of 1 9 10 11 and 5 2 3 4, we weigh.  There are three options: <br><br><ul><li>  Are equal.  A fake coin is among the numbers: 6 7 8. Compare 6 and 7, if equal - fake - 8, if 6 is more, then fake - 7, if 7 is more, then fake - 6, since in this case the fake coin is easier. </li><li>  The first group is heavier, then a fake coin is either 1 or 5. We compare 1 and 9, if they are equal - a fake coin - 5, if not - 1. </li><li>  The first group is easier, then fake among 2 3 4 coins, since it is known that 9, 10 and 11 are real, and the second group can only outweigh coins 2, 3 and 4. We compare 2 and 3, if equal, fake 4, if 2 is heavier, then false is 2, otherwise the 3rd is fake. </li></ul><br>  3) The case when the second group is heavier than the first is similar to the second. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ip/wm/is/ipwmissxixwkamv1i4fhvg-1bug.png" alt="image"></div><br>  The general diagram of the ‚ÄúDecision Tree‚Äù is presented below. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/z2/sn/hb/z2snhbh_jxfy70gglxflbvz5my4.png" alt="image"><br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Conclusion</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Upon receipt of the task for revision or debugging, it is good to apply the approach discussed above: <br><br><ol><li>  Decide what is given? </li><li>  Which elementary cases / tasks can be decomposed? </li><li>  What is unknown to solve the problem?  What experiments need to be carried out to reduce the entropy? </li><li>  Run. </li><li>  Problem solved?  Not?  Return to step 1. </li></ol><br>  Successful decisions. <br><br></div></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/447354/">https://habr.com/ru/post/447354/</a></p>
