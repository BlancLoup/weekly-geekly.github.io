  <section class="page js-page"><h1>We bring business to the international market in 5 minutes</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  One of the most frequent requests from our customers is to purchase a virtual number for doing business in another country or in another region.  We put it on the shelves and tell you how to increase the geography of your business with just 5 euros per month. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7d0/12b/9ea/7d012b9eaa61411581112962f4991a9b.png" alt="Zadarma"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Even to potential clients, we often have to explain why we need a virtual phone number.  Moreover, this conversation is not a monologue of a sales person, but a dialogue with a person or a business, who have many needs and for each such need we find a concrete example of using ip-telephony. <br><br>  One of the most frequent cases is the purchase of a virtual telephone number to enter a new geographic market.  An example is that you are a young and promising company, everyone in the team knows English and now you decide to enter the UK market.  What are we doing?  Of course, you can go into the marketing jungle and talk about industry analysis, market audit ... But in reality, the instruction is much simpler - you need to create a channel for communication with customers and partners:

A virtual office in the UK is created. </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6d5/414/0be/6d54140befd64bc3827a4ef8a1d25c0c.png"><br><br>  Calls are received by means of a program on a computer, applications on the phone or ip-phones installed in the office.  Let your responsible managers on a business trip, the call will still reach them (even if there is no Internet, just turn on the call forwarding to a mobile number). <br><br><h3>  <b>Who needs it?</b> </h3><br>  In fact, 90% of the business needs to enter new markets.  Many of them are thinking about going beyond the country.  And the scale of the business does not play any role.  Whether you are at least a design agency (a talented freelancer who paints without getting up from his bed in Izhevsk) or a silicone products factory in Serpukhov. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/05e/0e9/6aa/05e0e96aab9c40128ff631d82b50b868.png"><br><br>  If we talk specifically about the users of our service, who open virtual offices in the regions of Russia, Europe, the USA and even in Australia, these are most often designers, travel agencies, Internet services, logistics companies. <br>  People do not think when they call a local number where they actually call.  The most striking example is that many air carriers in order to take care of customers open such virtual offices in cities where they fly.  In fact, they simply hire a specialist who knows this or that language to the call center. <br>  But in general, hundreds of Russian brands are represented all over the world - manufacturers of footwear, clothing, and equipment - and they began their journey from such a virtual office. <br><br><h3>  <b>How much is?</b> </h3><br>  5 minutes and 5 euros per month.  These are not numbers to attract attention.  Indeed, <a href="https://zadarma.com/ru/tariffs/numbers/">buying a number</a> and <a href="https://zadarma.com/ru/support/instructions/pbx/">setting up a PBX</a> is a matter of 5 minutes.  Now about 5 euros.  In fact, such a virtual office can fit in and 1 euro per month.  After all, for incoming calls you do not pay, and pay only a monthly fee for a room.  On average, it is 1 or 2 euros per month, and the number itself is free.  We say ‚Äúon average‚Äù because everything depends on the city.  For example, renting a room in Manchester - 1 euro per month, in London - 1.6 euro per month, in New York - 1.6 euro per month, in Madrid - 2 euro per month, in Riga - 1.6 euro per a month, to Paris or Melbourne - also 2 euros per month, in Moscow - 120 rubles per month, and in St. Petersburg 190 rubles per month.  Your choice - 80 countries and nearly 100 cities in Russia.  If you want, you can even connect a toll-free number (analogue of our 8-800) in any country of the world, then you have to pay for all incoming from clients and partners, but a large number of companies opening this geography will also choose this option. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/161/1fe/620/1611fe6203924e2c8a41cfac2b2bed5c.jpg"><br><br>  5 euros per month - the average check of a small business that buys 1-2 numbers in different regions and makes outgoing calls from local numbers.  Cloud PBX for voice greetings, call recording and <a href="https://zadarma.com/ru/support/instructions/support/instructions/">integration with CRM systems is</a> completely free.  And, of course, in the PBX you still need to establish the definition (in common AON) of the purchased or confirmed number.  That is, one more privilege - you call to a foreign or regional company, and then a local number is determined and your accent will mean nothing at all - a correct conversation, a portfolio sent by mail and another successful contract. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/692/93d/20e/69293d20e2a840e38ba56d0b1f8de207.jpg"><br><br>  <b>PS</b> And we are not standing still, for example, in the last month we have expanded the coverage of virtual numbers even more, and also released a new version of the Zadarma program for iOS. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/324378/">https://habr.com/ru/post/324378/</a></p>
