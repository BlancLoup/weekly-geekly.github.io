Influence marketing helps to earn the trust of the target audience in situations where the standard approach is powerless.  How and why this happens in the article. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  Why fluencers are useful for brands </h3><br>  People are tired of obsessive sentences.  Influence marketing does not look like a pure advertisement, so it works.  This is a recommendation and friendly advice of a person whose opinion the audience trusts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c5f/db2/2f4/c5fdb22f4ff07a67c0c6b5f6e682a0af.jpg" alt="image">

      An advertising campaign with the participation of coolers is a product promotion thanks to opinion leaders.  In this case, there is no intrusive message ‚ÄúBuy it!‚Äù.  The consumer is triggered by the desire to be like, the credibility of that person, the attitude towards which is initially positive. <br><br><h3>  About the influence in marketing </h3><br>  There are three levels of influence on the audience: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Microenvironment</b> .  These are opinions of relatives, friends and acquaintances.  They have considerable weight when it comes to a large group of people.  The brand has almost no influence on them directly.  Here you need a solid reputation. </li><li>  <b>Macromedia</b> .  It's about the influence of famous people.  Just as they become influencers. </li><li>  <b>Megacad</b> .  Scope of influence of media, cinema, etc.  With the right approach, progress at this level will produce results. </li></ul><br>  Choosing the face of the brand, pay attention to the classification of applicants.  The "stars" include those who scored more than 500K subscribers.  Next come ‚ÄúOpinion Leaders‚Äù with an audience of 50K.  And ‚ÄúMicroblogger‚Äù with the number of subscribers up to 50K. <br><br>  More subscribers do not guarantee full audience involvement.  For the ‚ÄúStars‚Äù, the involvement is only 1%, for the ‚Äúmicroblogger‚Äù - up to 10%. <br><br>  If there are many subscribers, the influence dissipates and it becomes more difficult to maintain emotional contact with the audience.  For a brand, cooperation with several, less well-known bloggers may be more beneficial than with one superstar. <br><br><h3>  What produces influence marketing </h3><br>  Depending on the goals and format of the advertising campaign, the following types of products are distinguished: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>by type</b> : video content, special project placed from a blogger account or on a customer‚Äôs page, product placement, native integration, advertising, interactive; </li><li>  <b>by brand presence</b> : exclusive presence in the video or in the group of videos, integration with the transfer of rights to the material; </li><li>  <b>photo</b> : product development, special projects, reports; </li><li>  <b>text materials</b> : special project, article, report; </li><li>  <b>by the type of tasks to be solved</b> : sales, leads, image tasks, etc. </li></ul><br>  On the market of influence marketing there are production centers that produce content for sale, specialized agencies that manage advertising companies, bloggers exchanges and seeding systems that help ‚Äúdeliver‚Äù information to consumers. <br><br><h3>  What to look for when choosing an infuenser </h3><br>  When deciding who exactly will become the face of your brand, consider: <br><br><ul><li>  who subscribed to the profile.  Required information about age, gender, interests of subscribers.  Quantity also means a lot; </li><li>  how many views gaining content; </li><li>  number of likes and views; </li><li>  how active the audience is in terms of comments; </li><li>  how much are the services of a blogger. </li></ul><br>  To assess the result of cooperation, use the following indicators: <br><br><ul><li>  likes and views; </li><li>  information about the audience; </li><li>  average video viewing time; </li><li>  devices from which content is viewed; </li><li>  tone of comments; </li><li>  the number of people who committed the target action. </li></ul><br>  The choice of parameters for evaluation depends on the type of product and the goals of the campaign.  The number of views will not do anything if the purpose was to fill out a questionnaire. <br><br><h3>  Benefits of influence marketing </h3><br>  By attracting famous people to promote your brand, you get: <br><br><ol><li>  <b>Association with fame</b> .  Popular - does not mean everyone's favorite.  But a blogger or celebrity will always attract the attention of the audience.  Even if the audience after watching the video with Beckham thinks exactly how much he was paid, the product being promoted will still ‚Äúcrash into memory‚Äù. <br><br>  Brands are choosing infleuserov and "domestic production."  For example, in the profile of the blogger and presenter Nastya Ivleeva there are posts ‚Äúby request‚Äù.  But they are so harmoniously inscribed that subscribers are not annoyed <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/783/ddb/404/783ddb40413aebf91aae77b92e29b593.jpg" alt="image"></li><li>  <b>The true tone of communication</b> .  Every blogger has his own way of submitting information.  The tone is one of the reasons why a well-known person is gaining subscribers and one of the factors that help the success of an advertising campaign. <br><br>  Timati published a post on Instagram, in which he called the BORK company ‚Äúhandsome‚Äù for the production of a golden meat grinder.  And the audience appreciated it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a3b/a81/133/a3ba811338d42cd41b249e89daf491fa.jpg" alt="image"></li><li>  <b>Target audience</b> .  To find your customers, it is enough to choose the right person.  If you promote beauty and health products, look for a popular instagram account.  If your audience is gamers, find the appropriate Youtube channel.  Marketers can choose an infuenser with a close, but not exactly appropriate audience for the brand, in order to expand the influence. <br><br>  For example, Kati Clap has a female audience.  And advertising also targets the fair sex. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1de/fbd/640/1defbd6406b2211fec0e4f684f32c335.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Blogs are not only young people.  A vivid example is Valentina Ivanovna (Bab Valya). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/361/bd5/ac3/361bd5ac3259d58f4c001d1002f0502c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Wylsacom mentions in his posts not only new technologies.  Lego also finds its customers among blogger subscribers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/66e/b92/cfc/66eb92cfc27d0c8a93a5ab97fec596ee.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A variety of personalities on the Internet helps to make advertising more targeted. <br></li></ol><br>  Another advantage of influence-marketing is the duration of existence.  Unlike television advertising, the post on the Internet will ‚Äúlive by itself‚Äù as long as the account exists.  In this case, it will be viewed by all new subscribers. <br><br>  Do not chase the media face with millions of followers.  With such an audience is difficult to determine the effectiveness of advertising costs.  Collaboration with less popular people can give the best result. <br><br>  You can agree on advertising in person, or use the bloggers exchange.  View candidates and their ratings on Insense, LabelUp, EPICSTAR, GetBlogger and other exchanges. <br>  It is possible to organize an advertisement with the involvement of the coolers and without special expenses.  Agree with your customers about the discount for feedback on popular otzovikah sites.  Little-known bloggers can publish a post on a barter basis.  Provide a service or make a gift in exchange for mentioning a brand.  This method works well when you are interested in a certain territory and the blogger is known ‚Äúin a narrow circle‚Äù. <br><br>  Selecting an infuenser is not an easy task, but ‚Äúhitting the target‚Äù will provide the company with the loyalty and attention of the target audience, since Influence Marketing is a promotion without pressure.  The recommendation format from a trusted person leaves the client with a choice.  In addition, advertising in this case is a space for experimentation and new discoveries. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/428105/">https://habr.com/ru/post/428105/</a></p>
