But the problem is that there are a lot of methods for increasing personal productivity, but time is short.  Therefore, checking them all in parallel with the main activity is not productive.  But we do not need.  Chris Bailey spent dozens of experiments and the most effective, shared in the book " <a href="http://f.gdeslon.ru/f/cf3c732312432903">My productive year</a> ." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/810/6b6/907/8106b6907a014b7d91bd3285510d55d2.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Efficiency = attention + energy + time </h2><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúIf you want to achieve greater productivity, time management must give way to managing energy and attention.‚Äù </blockquote>

      <b>Here is what the author writes about time management:</b> <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúStrictly speaking, it‚Äôs impossible to manage time.  You can optimize its use if your job is to directly manipulate material objects.  But to control the course of time will not work.  Time is already 13.8 billion years ahead, and there are no signs that it will stop soon. ‚Äù </blockquote><br><br>  To work smartly, not just a lot - the dream of many people.  The topic of energy management is just about that.  Its meaning is simple - you need to plan your schedule so that the implementation of the most important and difficult tasks fell at a time when you have more strength and energy. <br><br>  Determining your energy fluctuations is not difficult.  An experiment helped me in this, during which I eliminated artificial energy stimulants such as coffee from my diet.  Due to this, I avoided sharp jumps and drops in energy and was able to concentrate on the true level of energy. <br><br>  Employment is no different from laziness, if it does not lead to the achievement of results.  Productivity is unemployment or efficiency.  Productivity is what results you achieve <br><br>  <b>It is not enough to determine the cycles of your energy, so the author cites several dozen tips that will help:</b> <br><ul><li>  adjust the energy level to your needs </li><li>  use your free time efficiently </li><li>  determine the optimal schedule of work and rest </li><li>  perform a big task quickly and efficiently </li><li>  boost energy </li><li>  use the internet efficiently </li><li>  and much more </li></ul><br>  The return on any method of productivity should be simply enormous, because for every minute that you invest in your productivity, you lose one minute that could be spent on real work. <br><br>  We are all tired of the trivial advice of mediocre business coaches, so this phrase pleased me.  The author admits that the pursuit of productivity can harm the work, because it takes a lot of time, attention and energy.  That is why Chris Bailey, conducting dozens of experiments, identified only a few key rules, the return on which is maximum. <br><br><h3>  about the author </h3><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/77c/50e/c61/77c50ec6119943889df439a25605d5b9.jpg">  I followed Chris's blog for about a year.  His experiment ‚ÄúThe Year of Productivity‚Äù interested me and I was looking forward to the book I read with pleasure during the long flights between Moscow and NY. <br><br>  The author wrote articles for well-known publications like The New York Times, The Huffington Post, The New York, Fast Company and Lifehacker.  In addition, Chris spoke at the TED conference, which called him "arguably the most productive person on the planet."  Although this can be and argue <br><br>  <a href="http://f.gdeslon.ru/f/cf3c732312432903">Buy Chris Bailey's book ‚ÄúMy productive year: How I checked the most famous methods of personal effectiveness on myself‚Äù on the publisher's website.</a> <br><br><h3>  Similar books on productivity that I really like </h3><br>  I love these books very much.
