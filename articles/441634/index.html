      Usually retro computers are assembled for retro games.  With them, as a rule, there are no special problems (well, except for those relevant for that era).  Therefore, it is not worth considering this ‚Äúlife‚Äù.  I looked at life from a more everyday point of view - to sit on the Internet, type text, listen to music, watch movies.  Although, of course, the latter depends not so much on the OS, but on the iron used.  My toilet should have enough problems on DVD and divx, but with x264 and later codecs, it already can not cope. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  About iron </h3><br>  In order not to return, let me remind you about the iron one.  I collected a computer that is current around 2001. <br>  Celeron Tualatin 1200 @ 1600 (133 over the bus), 512 megabytes of memory (the motherboard on the 815 chipset no longer sees). <br><br>  The video card has changed since the last article was published - instead of Matrox, I put the GeForce2 MX200.  The choice even for 2001 is not the best, but the GeForce3 did not find, the existing MX440 is already a little later vidyushka.  I saw the MX200 paired with pentiums4 in the configs of 2004-2005, people even tried to play them in San Andreas. <br><br>  The sound card is still SB Live! <br><br>  The rest is trivia. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/756/5f8/17c/7565f817c48ffbd7e950dbc19646454f.jpg" width="900" height="688"><br><br><h3>  operating system </h3><br>  As follows from the theme, the OS is Windows 98SE, Russian. <br><br>  In nature, there is a win98IF build with a bunch of drivers and software, but I don‚Äôt like it because of that heap.  Too much unnecessary, even the photoshop shove managed.  Simple Windows can not get there even in the minimum version.  Therefore, I preferred to install update packages from maximus on a clean OS. <br><br>  There is still a <a href="https://msfn.org/board/topic/80800-auto-patcher-for-windows-98se-english/" rel="noopener noreferrer">autometapatcher for 300 megabytes</a> with a tail in nature, which puts everything on its own, but it‚Äôs more under the English version, it‚Äôs sharpened, and I don‚Äôt want to figure out what‚Äôs in these 300 megabytes. <br><br>  Further I will give references to the used software mainly on mega.nz, where I downloaded it myself - because I‚Äôm more or less sure of their vividness. <br><br>  Well, in general, so as not to go far, let everything be in one place. <br><br>  Although the first thing put <a href="https://mega.nz/" rel="noopener noreferrer">IE6sp1</a> . <br>  Then <a href="https://mega.nz/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maximus Decim Cumulative Update 3.05</a> (updates, support for large disks, support for usb storage, etc.). <br>  Then <a href="https://mega.nz/" rel="noopener noreferrer">DirectX 9c</a> . <br>  Then <a href="https://mega.nz/" rel="noopener noreferrer">MD InternetExplorer 6.0sp1 Component Update 3.4</a> - updates for IE6 <br>  <a href="https://mega.nz/" rel="noopener noreferrer">MD Data Access Component Update</a> - all sorts of components for data access (XML, ODBC, etc.). <br><br>  Further, <a href="https://mega.nz/" rel="noopener noreferrer">KernelEx-4.5.2.exe</a> - ‚Äúwindows emulator for windows‚Äù allows you to run programs on Windows 9x, which are designed for later versions of the OS, adding settings like compatibility mode from the NT line to program properties.  Not a panacea - some programs do not run using kernelex.  But life is still somewhat easier. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d9d/573/9b7/d9d5739b751a1a8edc88ed5abad2e7c9.jpg"><br><br>  Finished everything with <a href="https://mega.nz/" rel="noopener noreferrer">.Net 1.1 and 2.0</a> installation - just to be. <br><br>  Well, purely for aesthetic reasons, added support for beautiful with 32-bit icons ( <a href="https://mega.nz/" rel="noopener noreferrer">RP9.7</a> ). <br><br>  It turned out something like this (although this is already with spoilers as part of the software :)): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4d2/f8a/5c1/4d2f8a5c13c9ba2e229a664cac3b0a87.jpg"><br><br>  Yes, for my own convenience, I mainly experimented with VirtualBox in a virtual machine.  Some of the features this brings, for example, the same Firefox in the virtual machine I have rolled out much more than on real hardware. <br><br><h3>  Internets </h3><br>  The 98SE browser initially stands, sorry for the expression, Internet Explorer 5. With it, wherever you go, you always stick to ‚Äúsomething is wrong with this site‚Äù (because of https).  But, strangely enough, Google opens normally - for ancient browsers it goes to http. <br><br>  But almost any link from the search results is already breaking off.  Although you can order a saved copy and try to read something there. <br><br>  In the end, after a lot of entertainment, it came to the conclusion that the last sensible native browser for 98 is Opera 9.64, but it is already not enough.  As a result, using KernelEx, we managed to launch <a href="https://mega.nz/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Opera 12.02</a> and <a href="https://mega.nz/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firefox 10.0.12 ESR</a> . <br><br>  Firefox opens slightly more sites, Opera is easier for the system and works more stable.  But all sorts of modern frameworks do not like both browsers. <br><br>  Habr in opera 9.64 looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/24a/e3d/6d6/24ae3d6d6a84326ff97ed05154f4d011.jpg"><br><br>  In firefox and opera 12.02 something like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7a4/99b/8db/7a499b8db821096af1d98ed642c906c5.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/034/351/a10/034351a106cc182d169fccc574b567ad.jpg"><br><br>  Only if the opera on Habr√© still moves somehow, then the firefox stops responding to commands after opening the page. <br><br>  Because the main browser is opera, and firefox is on the pickup. <br><br>  In general, the sites that I regularly use (under the names of the sites - screenshots of how the site opens).  Checked in Opera 12.02, true under Windows 10 (again for convenience). <br><br>  <a href="" rel="noopener noreferrer">google.com</a> - works <br>  <a href="" rel="noopener noreferrer">gmail</a> is a basic html version.  Although it‚Äôs usual for me, I even prefer it on modern browser computers. <br>  <a href="" rel="noopener noreferrer">google maps</a> - not working <br>  <a href="" rel="noopener noreferrer">yandex.ru</a> - works, although script errors get out <br>  <a href="" rel="noopener noreferrer">yandex.mail</a> works <br>  <a href="" rel="noopener noreferrer">maps.yandex.ru</a> - conditionally works.  Complains of the old browser, but at least it opens, unlike Google.  Problems only with hardware requirements.  On p3-1,6 / 512, everything happens sooo slowly and with frequent holes like "no data". <br>  <a href="" rel="noopener noreferrer">metro.yandex.ru</a> - the situation is about the same as with the cards.  In principle, the browser is supported and everything is rather slowly drawn on the main computer, but on P3 the eternal loading of the map goes. <br>  <a href="" rel="noopener noreferrer">ixbt.com</a> - in opera 12.02 sometimes an eternal download, sometimes opens.  And at 9.64 it opened stably.  The firefox opens. <br>  <a href="" rel="noopener noreferrer">forum.ixbt.com</a> - works, although the registration form sometimes has to be received through the reverse (not to press "Enter", but try to answer in some topic). <br>  <a href="" rel="noopener noreferrer">booking.com</a> - opens, but is not suitable for use.  In Firefox, you can use the search, but nothing can be booked.  In opera and search does not work. <br>  <a href="" rel="noopener noreferrer">skyscanner.com</a> - the design almost does not stomps, but it is impossible to use.  Google flights and <a href="" rel="noopener noreferrer">aviasales are</a> no better.  In Google Opera, the opera is generally thrown out, the firefox still survives. <br>  <a href="" rel="noopener noreferrer">flibusta.is</a> - opens, you can use <br>  <a href="" rel="noopener noreferrer">rutracker.org</a> - opens, there are some troubles with the search, but you can use <br>  <a href="" rel="noopener noreferrer">nix.ru</a> - conditionally works.  You can see the price list, but any manipulations with filters either do not work (opera) or hang up the browser (firefox). <br>  <a href="" rel="noopener noreferrer">dns-shop.ru</a> - with filters about the same story as in the nix, drop-down menus do not fall out.  But you can just watch. <br>  <a href="" rel="noopener noreferrer">ebay.com</a> - you can watch, you can not buy. <br>  <a href="" rel="noopener noreferrer">avito.ru</a> - you can watch, you can not buy. <br>  <a href="" rel="noopener noreferrer">aliexpress.com</a> - you can watch, you can not buy.  Although the design stomps least of all trading platforms. <br>  <a href="" rel="noopener noreferrer">livejournal.com</a> - opens, but slows down.  In general, it strongly depends on the style of the magazine.  But the main page in the new style is better not to look. <br>  <a href="" rel="noopener noreferrer">youtube</a> - not grown together.  Put flash11, but when you try to play videos either says "only html5" or just freezes. <br><br>  A separate type of Internet is <strong>email</strong> .  Many mail services have a simple html interface for slower channels / old browsers.  Google and Yandex are accurate, and with Google, I use this interface by default.  Because "modern" does not work well on my i5-7500 / 16GB.  Not responsive enough.  At the expense of the same desktop client - <a href="https://mega.nz/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thunderbird 2.0.0.24</a> works without questions, with Google Mail and web-based SSL and receives and sends letters. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a61/be8/f6a/a61be8f6ab9f779767ed52dc93b5fd6d.jpg"><br><br>  <strong>Torrents</strong> .  <a href="https://mega.nz/" rel="noopener noreferrer">utorrent 1.8.2 wound up</a> without problems, but newer and not necessary. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0a2/5ab/701/0a25ab7011ed21186f602586daae9fb5.jpg"><br><br><h3>  Office </h3><br>  Well, the abstract office suite, which has everything you need - MS Office XP.  The problem is only with office 2007 (docx) files.  You can somehow put <a href="https://mega.nz/" rel="noopener noreferrer">the compatibility package</a> (even if it requires windows 2000+, you can install it through kernelex - first unpack it, then run msi), but that compatibility still works. <br><br>  Even <a href="https://mega.nz/" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenOffice 3.2.1 is</a> better.  Though not a fountain either.  OpenOffice only puts version 3.2, LibreOffice refuses to install it already - changed the version of windows installer. <br><br>  This is the original test file: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e65/a68/043/e65a680431e6e70fe293a1e771d312fc.jpg"><br><br>  So it opens OO3.2 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b36/48b/35d/b3648b35d22af5484c4e211a3e1a55db.jpg"><br><br>  And this is how MSO XP is perceived with a converter: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ab0/134/963/ab01349637dfa29506c1b2740ebf7efd.jpg"><br><br>  Moreover, Russian fonts constantly float - when selecting, changing the scale, changing the typeface, they turn from letters into squares or question marks.  For the screenshot, I somehow picked up the maximum number of Russian letters, but it opens all in squares. <br><br>  Office 2003 through kernelex kicks can be put, but it does not work. <br><br>  <strong>Reading e-books</strong> - PDF, DJVU and other epub.  There are enough options, but I chose <a href="https://mega.nz/" rel="noopener noreferrer">SumatraPDF</a> .  A fairly light universal viewer that normally opens and large files of 200-300 megabytes. <br>  PDF to 200 megabytes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f29/902/003/f29902003d22bb1395312401731d886e.jpg"><br><br>  DJVU. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ffd/08e/078/ffd08e078d41cbb00f488ceb23002251.jpg"><br><br><h3>  Music </h3><br>  Here I am not in the subject and still shake, listen only to mp3.  Everyones there flakes and other aaki not about me. <br><br>  So, staying true to the retro theme, we put <a href="https://mega.nz/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Winamp</a> .  The classic deuce, triples and fives nafig. <br><br>  Llama tested, mother approved. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ec4/08f/943/ec408f943c45bb14fdf9d5162f6d68a7.jpg"><br><br>  Although like some of the fives still worked under 9x. <br><br><h3>  Video </h3><br>  Then I rested for a long time - in my virtual machine, I only played avishki normally, and even not in all players.  In the media player, for example, we managed to force it, but in vlc there was no sound. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/412/9ce/434/4129ce434be2d2fd917de853ec4af7d4.jpg"><br><br>  Long picked, then decided to postpone until launch on real hardware.  Here in the same vlc 2.0.0 and video and sound appeared.  So obviously some problems with the virtual machine.  Picture quality, however, is normal only in avishki, and MKV and MP4 are lame.  MKV (h264 / mp3) crumbles into squares, and MP4 (h264 / aac) loses frames.  But this is the second question, I achieved the playback itself, and you can take codecs and players for a long time.  At least there is a solution, and fine tuning needs to be done on a specific hardware. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/999/4ef/abd/9994efabd2e0ce5079465426a347434e.jpg" width="900" height="720"><br><br><h3>  Graphics processing </h3><br>  Viewing - I have been using the unprecedented viewer for a long time.  The good thing is that a license without reservations allows commercial use, and the majority of users have enough opportunities.  Well, <a href="https://mega.nz/" rel="noopener noreferrer">there is a version for Windows 98</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/143/6df/517/1436df517cf61238fe9b8df467ea5d48.jpg"><br><br>  Editing - Photoshop is quite enough for a family home (like the seven under 9x still worked).  Although I have been using <a href="https://mega.nz/" rel="noopener noreferrer">PixBuilder Studio for a</a> long time as a simple, nimble editor.  Under 98, it started up normally, I don‚Äôt even know if kernelex helped here or not, I didn‚Äôt have to force compatibility. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/118/ed7/fc7/118ed7fc77b992422cc9d064704ea97f.jpg"><br><br><h3>  Work with files </h3><br>  File manager.  It seems like Total Commander 8 works, but I used FAR in those days.  Because <a href="https://mega.nz/" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAR Manager 1.75</a> .  Although maybe a deuce will work, did not check. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0a4/31e/4fe/0a431e4fe35aa4318befe454bf481689.jpg"><br><br>  Archiver - <a href="https://mega.nz/" rel="noopener noreferrer">7-zip 9.20</a> .  For the most part it is quite enough, except that some recent innovations in 7z and rar does not read.  But they do not so often come across. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/302/06e/3fc/30206e3fc98fcf77251fcf0dc9078f97.jpg"><br><br><h3>  Data exchange </h3><br>  Considering the fact that now there are already a lot of problems even with windows xp (a dozen are constantly striving to disable support for smb1, etc.), for sharing files with Windows 98 I just raised an ftp server on my home server, since the protocol has nothing since has changed.  And the shared folders painfully work unstably for me - sometimes it turns out to get through, and after a few minutes the ‚Äúserver was not found‚Äù, starts asking for a password or something. <br><br>  So it is easier to raise ftp and copy files through the same FAR Manager. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f75/698/a7b/f75698a7b8665824caa0790ec16928f6.jpg"><br><br>  At the expense of printing to a network printer.  I have a classic network printer at home, connected via ezernet.  Therefore, everything is somewhat simpler with it than with a shared printer on Windows.  Well, he Hewlett Packard (HP Color LaserJet CP2025dn), which further simplifies life in terms of drivers.  I used to have samsung, but I got rid of it.  Byaka  Began to fall apart without even printing the starting cartridges. <br><br>  Driver 98, I put the standard screw HP Color LaserJet (MS).  I don't need to be beautiful, I just need to type. <br><br>  And the print itself goes with the help of the utility <a href="" rel="noopener noreferrer">ACITS LPR Client</a> .  It is installed and configured without problems.  Install the utility, then set the printer as local by installing the correct driver.  And then change the port to ACITS LPR Remote Printing, specify the printer's IP - and that's it.  Instructions with pictures in the kit goes.  Well, or you can <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/acis/ninja/winME.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">take advantage of this</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0be/ab5/7dc/0beab57dc4bb75b44dc8ab6902e4b9c3.jpg"><br><br>  Print quality is worse than through the correct driver, but for text and diagrams will do. <br>  On the left, the picture is printed with Windows 10, on the right - with 98. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ef9/429/e4d/ef9429e4d0083c8e046b5b5916032565.jpg" width="938" height="800"><br><br><h3>  Remote control </h3><br>  Normally, <a href="https://www.tightvnc.com/download-old.php" rel="noopener noreferrer">tightVNC 1.3</a> works, both client and server. <br><br>  ssh / telnet client - <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/releases/0.61.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">putty 0.61</a> , for example. <br><br>  I could not find the RDP client quickly, but today it will be of little use for use.  Only with old servers, and on new ones to connect such old clients will have to give up security. <br><br><h3>  Total </h3><br>  The messengers, social networks and other YouTube have not been covered, but do you really need it under 98? <br><br>  Actual instant messengers will not start, except that some jabber-client like the old Miranda. <br><br>  I practically don‚Äôt use social networks, but YouTube ... Download videos on a normal computer and watch them through vlc, for example. <br><br>  So, answering the question ‚ÄúIs there life under Windows 98?‚Äù I can say that ‚ÄúThere is, but is this life?‚Äù <br><br>  Formally, a lot can be done, something is not even worse than under the current OS.  But with the Internet under 98 a lot of problems.  And this is now the main purpose of the computer. <br>  Therefore, you can use 98 only for highly specific tasks or if your computer does not pull newer operating systems. <br><br>  If, however, pulls, it is better to put XP, and in 98 to return only for the sake of old toys. <br><br><h3>  What's next </h3><br>  Then I have two Voodoo 2. And slot Pentium 3 450, with which they are combined much better than with the toilet. <br><br>  Therefore, at leisure, you will need to try to build and run Voodoo2 SLI.  It is possible to add AWE32 here for complete happiness. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/181/7f5/0b5/1817f50b5222e28c33046ef34639a662.jpg" width="900" height="675"><br><br>  There is a motherboard on Socket7 and several processors for it.  True, the problem is that when I installed the cooler, I broke the mount, because the motherboard is not touching.  It is necessary to find a dead mother on socket7 and throw a socket.  Well, a cooler with a normal mount so that it no longer breaks my sockets.  And even the ATShny case is available, albeit coolly scratched. <br><br>  It would be possible to try to collect the config with the woods here, but they are too long and run into the cooler.  If one accelerator somehow gets up, the second one will already need to be improved by the file.
