Science is developing one-sidedly, for example, electrical engineering has a fundamental basis and convenient applied modeling tools, and politics is deprived of all this.  Someday, mankind will create polit-technology (first political physics) and all political processes will be as understandable and predictable as electricity. <br><br>  We will try to borrow and look at political processes with the ‚Äúeyes‚Äù and laws of electrical engineering, and then use well-known electrical circuit simulators to model political processes.  The future Ohm‚Äôs / Kirghoff's Law for the Digital Political Chain will differ from its prototypes by its own metamodel interpreting the laws of society into corresponding laws of nature that exist objectively, i.e.  regardless of the person's ideas about them. <br><br>  With politics, everything is different now: even the ancient Greek stage of the formation of the "science of politics" is not passed (the initial stage of digitization of politics).

      Polit-electrical engineering is one of the areas of policy digitalization, when circuit engineering comes to the aid of simulation modeling of sociopolitical processes, i.e.  the use of conventional visual electrical circuit simulators in the simulation of socio-political processes (events, crises, disasters). <br><br>  The approach is demonstrated on a simplified consumer society model, and falstad is used as an electronic circuit simulator. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Introduction </h2><br>  Research Plan: <br><br>  A) The chosen object of study of social and political nature <br><br>  B) The interpretation of the laws of the object of study in the laws of electrical engineering (metamodel) <br><br>  <a href="http://www.falstad.com/circuit_ru/directions.html">C</a> ) A fragment of the model of the object of study is constructed, the model is demonstrated by means of the electronic circuit simulator <a href="http://www.falstad.com/circuit_ru/directions.html">falstad</a> <br><br>  Object of study - <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259E%25D0%25B1%25D1%2589%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">consumer society</a> <br>  <a href="https://rgdn.info/obschestvo_potrebleniya_a_est_li_vyhod">Erich Fromm</a> spoke more loudly about him. <br>  If one of the residents at least half a million cities wants to look at consumer society, then it‚Äôs enough to look out the window. <br><br>  If sociopolitical processes (events) can be interpreted and presented by a metamodel obeying similar laws of electrical processes, then a policy can be described using the rules of electrical engineering (theory), starting with Ohm's law.  This version of the modeling of political and social processes will allow the use of reliable, studied and mathematically rigorous mechanisms, and most importantly, ready-made simulation tools. <br><br>  The proposed metamodel ‚ÄúPolitical Electrical Engineering.  Consumption society ‚Äùis based on empirical laws (laws that have their source of experience based on direct observations) of a consumer society and qualitatively reflects the processes occurring in this society.  More precisely: it is based on the ‚Äúdirect observations‚Äù of the author, since  failed to find a suitable known (published) mathematical model of the society in question. <br><br>  Despite the fact that the given model of a consumer society is simplified, it can be detailed and supplemented with quantitative parameters reflecting real statistics, market situation, budget parameters, taxes, changes in the national currency rate, etc. as part of the proposed tool (simulator) and metamodel. . <br><br>  To study the laws of electrical engineering there are various simulators of electronic circuits.  The examples are made in falstad (java applet), the text gives direct links to the resulting schemes (without duplicating the text), if the links do not work - check the installation of the Java machine, try another browser, etc. <br><br>  What is important is the visual process simulator, since  it allows you to visually show the "physics of the process", the general approach, the metamodel, and also to demonstrate the dynamics of a particular process.  Looking at the "bare formulas" and Kirgoff's system of equations is not the best way to quickly penetrate into the model, which allows determining the current political trends and tensions of society through current and voltage equivalents. <br><br><h2>  1 metamodel </h2><br>  The electrical quantities AMP, VOLT, OHM are interpreted by the socio-political Meta-Trinity: <br><br><ul><li>  current, current (A) = the strength of an action, for example, the volume of consumption of goods (by analogy, the level of current consumption) in a consumer society or the volume of protests against public dissatisfaction with a decrease in the level of consumption. </li><li>  tension (V) = level of social tension in society, i.e.  "Protest" movement.  Tension in society, as a potential that can transform into kinetic energy in the form of protest. </li><li>  resistance (Ohms) = resistance to the transition from some potential threat to the practical plane, activity.  Counteraction to the transition of the accumulated potential into the current (the movement of electrons as the movement of people), for example, into an open protest movement. </li></ul><br>  We will not give the laws of electrical engineering: not only are they known and objective, they are already embedded in any circuit simulator. <br><br>  Some laws of a consumer society (quite briefly, so that only a general idea): <br><br><ol><li>  Consumption requests are always growing, because  you always want ‚Äúmore and more‚Äù (today you must consume more than yesterday). </li><li>  Requests for consumption (waiting for consumption) are always greater than the ability to actually ‚Äúconsume‚Äù, primarily due to the budget constraints on purchases / services. </li><li>  The difference between the request for consumption (waiting) and the budget (reality) is transformed into a protest.  The strength of the consumer society - as the ‚Äústrength of expected consumption‚Äù means ‚Äúthe total force present in society‚Äù and consists of the ‚Äúpower of consumption‚Äù (the power to consume goods and services) and the strength of the protest movement. </li></ol><br>  The main irritant in society is the inability to consume as much as planned (expected).  An irritant creates tension and, depending on the behavior of the authorities, there are various options for lowering the tension: relieving tension by controlling protest forces or increasing the budget for consumption. <br><br><h2>  2 Basic model </h2><br>  The basic model of a consumer society includes three main contours (contour trinity). <br><br><h3>  2.1 Consumption Circuit </h3><br>  The imitative socio-political model of the Consumer Society is based on the ‚Äúconsumption contour‚Äù (sometimes it is the only one). <br><br>  Consider a simplified view of the ‚Äúconsumption process‚Äù: there is a generator (source) of desires and there is a performer (implementer) of desires. <br><br>  In its simplest form, it looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/t5/-m/-u/t5-m-uu-v68rg3q2waeuozoiknm.png"><br><br>  The main force of the consumer society is ‚Äúto consume‚Äù, therefore the source of energy will initially be ‚Äúthe power of the desire to consume‚Äù.  As a source of desires (generator of desires) use the power source. <br><br>  <b>Gelik</b> <br><br>  The power of desire to consume is shown by a simple example.  Take not a large and complex society as a whole, but a small piece of it - a family, and not all the needs of the family, but only in terms of motor transport. <br><br>  And not even real needs, but image ones - because  these are the basic needs of the consumer society, due to the fact that the consumer society is not at the foot of Maslow‚Äôs pyramid. <br><br>  For example, a family has a need to buy (have) two ‚Äúbig black jeep‚Äù (BHD).  LBH, for example, Gelik - we will use as a unit of consumption (and a symbol of a consumer society), because  there is no place to go for a family (you do not need it), and if you need it once a month, then the road is only with good asphalt. <br><br>  It is rightly called ‚Äúirrational consumer culture‚Äù, i.e.  Gelendvagen is needed not to overcome off-road (solving functional problems), but as a demonstration of social status (success, that is, to solve non-functional tasks). <br><br>  We will assume (for example) that in 2013 taxes and prices were ‚Äúsatisfactory‚Äù, i.e.  fully met our needs (expectations, aspirations) in ‚ÄúTwo Gelendwagen‚Äù.  There was also an adequate budget. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.falstad.com/circuit/circuitjs.html%3Fcct%3D%2524%2B1%2B0.000005%2B2.1831051418620846%2B29%2B5%2B46%250Aw%2B256%2B80%2B384%2B80%2B0%250Aw%2B176%2B80%2B256%2B80%2B0%250Aw%2B384%2B416%2B320%2B416%2B0%250Aw%2B256%2B416%2B208%2B416%2B0%250Aw%2B320%2B416%2B256%2B416%2B0%250Aw%2B464%2B416%2B384%2B416%2B0%250Aw%2B208%2B416%2B176%2B416%2B0%250Ai%2B176%2B192%2B176%2B80%2B0%2B2%250Aw%2B464%2B80%2B544%2B80%2B0%250Aw%2B464%2B416%2B544%2B416%2B0%250Ap%2B544%2B80%2B544%2B192%2B1%2B0%250Aw%2B176%2B192%2B176%2B416%2B0%250Aw%2B544%2B192%2B544%2B416%2B0%250A370%2B384%2B80%2B384%2B416%2B1%2B0%250Aw%2B464%2B80%2B384%2B80%2B0%250A">Scheme "Revealed - satisfied"</a> <br><br>  The scheme ‚ÄúRevealed - satisfied‚Äù with comments: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jh/sr/je/jhsrjembrpyfsl-igphveztpbts.jpeg"><br><br>  The master current generator generates a need corresponding to the value of two ‚Äúbig black jeep‚Äù, i.e.  2xDBCH or 2A.  You can also call: ‚Äúthe strength of a consumer society‚Äù, ‚Äúthe strength of needs‚Äù (by analogy with the strength of the current).  The diagram shows: I want two LBHs (the volume of desires, public inquiry), ‚Äúthe power of desire‚Äù = 2A. <br><br>  Let us denote ‚Äúsatisfactory‚Äù by the symbol ‚Äúammeter‚Äù, which reflects the current value in the consumption circuit (2A). <br><br>  Since all requests for consumption in society are satisfied, all ‚Äúconsumers are happy‚Äù and social tensions are zero.  However, this is an ideal situation (although it may be real, for example, for the elite of the High End category). <br><br>  For society as a whole and the family - there is always a limited budget, see the second law of consumption: Requests for consumption (consumption expectation) are always greater than the ability to actually ‚Äúconsume‚Äù. <br><br><h3>  2.2 Outline of protest </h3><br>  Since there are restrictions on the budget, the desires do not coincide with the possibilities (see the second and third laws of consumption). <br><br>  Suppose that instead of two ‚Äúbig and black‚Äù within the budget, they could only buy one LBH. <br><br>  The current of real consumption (budget volume) has halved, and the ‚ÄúPower to Consume Consumption Society‚Äù has not changed: ‚ÄúI want two big black jeeps‚Äù: <br><br><ul><li>  Ip (current, volume of needs) = 2  (2). </li><li>  Ib (budget volume) = 1  (1). </li></ul><br>  To simulate the situation of a limited budget, an appropriate value of the resistance of current consumption stabilization is selected (the volume of purchases within the budget, Ib). <br><br>  There was a ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù situation: the need to consume or the ‚ÄúPower to consume the consumer society‚Äù turned out to be twice as high as the opportunity (the available budget).  ‚ÄúTightening our belts more tightly‚Äù or submitting to the call ‚Äúthere is no money, but you hold on‚Äù ‚Äîfor the consumer society, this is not the way out, for it is the consumer society. <br><br>  We will model the situation of excess of desire over the budget, taking into account the third law of consumption.  We add a protest contour to the model, since  only the consumption and protest is capable of a consumer society. <br><br>  The current in the protest circuit begins to flow (the presence of a protest movement is a flow in society) ‚Äîwhen problems arise with the budget allocated for consumption, and problems always arise with the budget (unlimited desires and limited resources).  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs impossible to rebel,‚Äù the consumer puts the commas. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.falstad.com/circuit/circuitjs.html%3Fcct%3D%2524%2B1%2B0.000005%2B2.1831051418620846%2B29%2B5%2B46%250Aw%2B256%2B80%2B384%2B80%2B0%250Aw%2B176%2B80%2B256%2B80%2B0%250Aw%2B384%2B416%2B320%2B416%2B0%250Aw%2B256%2B416%2B208%2B416%2B0%250Aw%2B320%2B416%2B256%2B416%2B0%250Aw%2B464%2B416%2B384%2B416%2B0%250Aw%2B208%2B416%2B176%2B416%2B0%250Ai%2B176%2B192%2B176%2B80%2B0%2B2%250Aw%2B464%2B80%2B544%2B80%2B0%250Aw%2B464%2B416%2B544%2B416%2B0%250Ap%2B544%2B80%2B544%2B192%2B1%2B0%250Aw%2B176%2B192%2B176%2B416%2B0%250Aw%2B544%2B192%2B544%2B416%2B0%250A370%2B384%2B80%2B384%2B192%2B1%2B0%250Aw%2B464%2B80%2B384%2B80%2B0%250Ai%2B256%2B80%2B256%2B192%2B0%2B1%250Aw%2B256%2B192%2B256%2B416%2B0%250Aw%2B384%2B192%2B384%2B416%2B0%250A">Scheme "Limited Budget"</a> <br><br>  Half of the "forces" of society migrated to the contour of protest: the value of the current needs = 2 A (volume of needs = two jeeps), the value of the current of real consumption (the volume of the budget for the goods, in this case 1xBHD) = 1 A. <br><br>  A two-fold increase in LBB prices could have occurred only due to a double jump in the national currency rate, for example, in 2014 there was a budget for two LBDs (‚ÄúRevealed - satisfied‚Äù scheme), a year passed (the course jumped) and unexpectedly came to the ‚ÄúRestricted Budget‚Äù scheme. ". <br><br>  In addition to the $ rate, nothing has changed: the jeep of the same model, the salary in rubles (budget of consumption), of course, and a request for two jeep.  Social tension did not grow (remained the same), because  "Outrage unrest steam" released without through the contour of protest. <br><br>  However, for a more accurate picture of the situation, it is required to show the element ‚Äúlamp of anger‚Äù in the contour of protest.  We will limit the power consumption of the circuit.  There are limits to any elements, both electrical and socio-political. <br><br>  In the falstad simulator: Draw.  Outputs and information elements.  Add a light bulb.  The value of the lamp power, for example, 30 watts. <br><br>  Scheme ‚ÄúLimited budget.  Lamp" <br><br><br><br>  With the introduction of power limits to the circuit, the tension increases: social tension in society. <br><br>  The resistance of the lamp (resistor) reflects the resistance of the protest, for example, the protest prevention forces - in the form of state propaganda and intimidation, the protest resistance forces (protest resistance) - in the form of law enforcement agencies (forces), including the police and the guard. <br><br>  The ‚Äúprotest marketer‚Äù (anger) bulb advises the ‚ÄúNominal Power‚Äù slider.  Lamp power characterizes the potential of the protest movement.  When the value of the slider changes, one can observe a change in the level of social tension in society (a voltmeter). <br><br><h3>  2.3 Third Circuit, Revolutionary </h3><br>  The third circuit from the standpoint of electrical engineering is breakdown, and from the standpoint of politics it is revolutionary. <br>  If current increases (power source, i.e. consumer expectations) or protest resistance, if no steam release occurs in one of the circuits (through anger lamp or by increasing the budget), then the circuit shows an increase in voltage in the society (in general contour). <br><br>  We inevitably defuse the situation (defuse tension) with an element of the ‚Äúspark gap‚Äù type, which actually fixes the ‚Äúspark of revolution‚Äù - as a ‚Äúbreakdown‚Äù of the socio-political system (consumer society) under consideration. <br><br>  More precisely, the specific system of organization of society, containing the configuration of rules, laws, taxes, limits, budgets, other characteristics of monetary policy or characteristics of power and ideological (through the Ministry of "truth") control of society. <br><br>  By increasing the ‚Äúsociety‚Äôs demand for consumption‚Äù (by increasing the value of the ‚Äúconsumption expectation‚Äù current at the power source) and adding a simple spark gap (spark gap in the air) to the circuit and setting the breakdown voltage on it, two situations can be modeled. <br>  With a limited or even ‚Äúmuffled‚Äù consumption contour, for example, high taxes or vice versa - low incomes of the population, one of the following situations will occur: <br><br>  A) the power of the ‚Äúanger‚Äù lamp is sufficient and the ‚Äúrelease of steam‚Äù through the contour of the protest (more precisely, the contour of the ‚Äúprotest controlled by the authorities‚Äù) protects society from a dangerous level of social tension in which radical changes can occur. <br><br>  B) if not ‚Äústeam release‚Äù is insufficient (i.e. there is no possibility to relieve excessive pressure, stop the protest movement), then the accumulating social tension will surely ‚Äúbreak through‚Äù: both according to the laws of electrical engineering and political economy. <br><br>  In the falstad simulator: Draw.  Passive elements.  Add a spark gap, for example, with a breakdown voltage, 200V. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.falstad.com/circuit/circuitjs.html%3Fcct%3D%2524%2B1%2B0.000005%2B2.1831051418620846%2B29%2B5%2B46%250Aw%2B256%2B80%2B384%2B80%2B0%250Aw%2B176%2B80%2B256%2B80%2B0%250Aw%2B384%2B416%2B320%2B416%2B0%250Aw%2B256%2B416%2B208%2B416%2B0%250Aw%2B320%2B416%2B256%2B416%2B0%250Aw%2B464%2B416%2B384%2B416%2B0%250Aw%2B208%2B416%2B176%2B416%2B0%250Ai%2B176%2B192%2B176%2B80%2B0%2B2%250Aw%2B464%2B80%2B544%2B80%2B0%250Aw%2B464%2B416%2B544%2B416%2B0%250Ap%2B544%2B80%2B544%2B192%2B1%2B0%250Aw%2B176%2B192%2B176%2B416%2B0%250Aw%2B544%2B192%2B544%2B416%2B0%250A370%2B384%2B80%2B384%2B192%2B1%2B0%250Aw%2B464%2B80%2B384%2B80%2B0%250Ai%2B256%2B80%2B256%2B192%2B0%2B1%250Aw%2B256%2B192%2B256%2B416%2B0%250A181%2B384%2B192%2B384%2B416%2B0%2B323.9629079126011%2B30%2B100%2B0.4%2B0.4%250A187%2B464%2B80%2B464%2B192%2B0%2B1000%2B1000000000%2B200%2B0.001%250Aw%2B464%2B192%2B464%2B416%2B1%250A38%2B17%2B0%2B1%2B200%2BNominal%255CsPower%250A">Three Circuit Diagram</a> <br><br>  When the voltage increases after a while (25 ms), a spark passes through the spark.  In electrical engineering: when an overvoltage appears, the gap (discharger) must break through earlier than the insulation of the protected equipment. <br><br>  Similarly, for a model of society: a revolution ‚Äî like a radical restructuring (but at the beginning ‚Äî the demolition of the old configuration) ‚Äîis a similar spark (spark) that protects society from destruction. <br><br>  A revolution is not necessarily something large-scale and similar to the French or our February and October, it can be a radical change of course by changing the government (Armenia, 2018) or simply powerful protests (France, end of 2018). <br><br>  It does not necessarily change the scheme (new circuits and connections, additional circuits) of the modeled society, in this case - the consumer society, it is possible that the values ‚Äã‚Äãof the power of the lamps (resistance R), i.e.  there will be no reorganization of the scheme, but only its reconfiguration without changing the topology of the scheme (nature of the process). <br><br>  In this model, the model of the consumption process, the old principle ‚Äúthe more to consume, the better‚Äù will remain.  And so on until the next crisis or the final victory of a fundamentally new public paradigm. <br><br>  On this optimistic note, we could have finished, but we did not explicitly consider the ‚Äúwate-resistance‚Äù (wate-resistor).  Consider options for resistance in the contour of the protest. <br><br><h2>  3 Resistance in the contour of the protest </h2><br>  In the simplest version, we consider a fragment of the reduced consumption contour with the presence of three protest consumption chains and a spark gap.  The consumption contour is excluded. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.falstad.com/circuit/circuitjs.html%3Fcct%3D%2524%2B1%2B0.000005%2B2.1831051418620846%2B29%2B5%2B46%250Aw%2B256%2B80%2B320%2B80%2B0%250Aw%2B176%2B80%2B256%2B80%2B0%250Aw%2B384%2B416%2B320%2B416%2B0%250Aw%2B256%2B416%2B208%2B416%2B0%250Aw%2B320%2B416%2B256%2B416%2B0%250Aw%2B464%2B416%2B384%2B416%2B0%250Aw%2B208%2B416%2B176%2B416%2B0%250Ai%2B176%2B192%2B176%2B80%2B0%2B1%250Aw%2B464%2B80%2B544%2B80%2B0%250Aw%2B464%2B416%2B544%2B416%2B0%250Ap%2B544%2B80%2B544%2B192%2B1%2B0%250Aw%2B176%2B192%2B176%2B416%2B0%250Aw%2B544%2B192%2B544%2B416%2B0%250A370%2B384%2B80%2B384%2B160%2B1%2B0%250Aw%2B464%2B80%2B384%2B80%2B0%250A187%2B464%2B80%2B464%2B192%2B0%2B1000%2B1000000000%2B200%2B0.001%250Aw%2B464%2B192%2B464%2B416%2B1%250Aw%2B384%2B272%2B384%2B416%2B0%250Ar%2B256%2B416%2B256%2B160%2B0%2B500%250A370%2B256%2B80%2B256%2B160%2B1%2B0%250Ar%2B320%2B416%2B320%2B240%2B0%2B500%250A370%2B320%2B80%2B320%2B240%2B1%2B0%250Ar%2B384%2B272%2B384%2B160%2B0%2B500%250Aw%2B320%2B80%2B384%2B80%2B0%250A">Three Protest Scheme</a> <br><br>  We will assume that each resistance sets a certain level of resistance to any force. <br><br>  The left resistor is a ‚Äúpower resistor‚Äù.  He sets the level of power pressure on society, as well as the level of propaganda in terms of intimidation and disobedience of power.  The higher the resistance value (Ohms), the more stringent measures are applied to the protesters (real and potential, ie, ready to join the protest).  This branch (chain) simulates a protest against the authorities, when society is consuming its problems (little budget or a lot of tax, high prices) only the authorities blame (no one will blame themselves). <br><br>  The middle resistor sets the level of ‚Äústate propaganda‚Äù of the subject when the power is zombied by the population: a third party is to blame for everything, i.e.  not power and not a consumer.  We have it is usually "the machinations of the State Department" or "Fifth Column."  Here, the resistor rating determines how much the population (consumer society) is able to withstand state propaganda (do not believe). <br><br>  The right resistor - defines other ways to ‚Äústrain‚Äù (reset) the voltage and ‚Äúnot to sin‚Äù (revolution).  For example, these are some large-scale government projects that may temporarily distract consumers from their ‚Äúlittle consumption‚Äù problems (there are no other problems in society).  Such an example is the Olympiad with a ‚Äúmountain of gold medals‚Äù or getting involved in a regional war. <br><br>  For example, in 2014 it would be possible to consider the value of the right resistor at least two times lower than the rest (250 Ohms vs. 500 Ohms). <br><br>  <a href="http://www.falstad.com/circuit/circuitjs.html%3Fcct%3D%2524%2B1%2B0.000005%2B2.1831051418620846%2B29%2B5%2B46%250Aw%2B256%2B80%2B320%2B80%2B0%250Aw%2B176%2B80%2B256%2B80%2B0%250Aw%2B384%2B416%2B320%2B416%2B0%250Aw%2B256%2B416%2B208%2B416%2B0%250Aw%2B320%2B416%2B256%2B416%2B0%250Aw%2B464%2B416%2B384%2B416%2B0%250Aw%2B208%2B416%2B176%2B416%2B0%250Ai%2B176%2B192%2B176%2B80%2B0%2B1%250Aw%2B464%2B80%2B544%2B80%2B0%250Aw%2B464%2B416%2B544%2B416%2B0%250Ap%2B544%2B80%2B544%2B192%2B1%2B0%250Aw%2B176%2B192%2B176%2B416%2B0%250Aw%2B544%2B192%2B544%2B416%2B0%250A370%2B384%2B80%2B384%2B160%2B1%2B0%250Aw%2B464%2B80%2B384%2B80%2B0%250A187%2B464%2B80%2B464%2B192%2B0%2B1000%2B1000000000%2B200%2B0.001%250Aw%2B464%2B192%2B464%2B416%2B1%250Aw%2B384%2B272%2B384%2B416%2B0%250Ar%2B256%2B416%2B256%2B160%2B0%2B500%250A370%2B256%2B80%2B256%2B160%2B1%2B0%250Ar%2B320%2B416%2B320%2B240%2B0%2B500%250A370%2B320%2B80%2B320%2B240%2B1%2B0%250Ar%2B384%2B272%2B384%2B160%2B0%2B250%250Aw%2B320%2B80%2B384%2B80%2B0%250A">Scheme "Three protest.</a>  <a href="http://www.falstad.com/circuit/circuitjs.html%3Fcct%3D%2524%2B1%2B0.000005%2B2.1831051418620846%2B29%2B5%2B46%250Aw%2B256%2B80%2B320%2B80%2B0%250Aw%2B176%2B80%2B256%2B80%2B0%250Aw%2B384%2B416%2B320%2B416%2B0%250Aw%2B256%2B416%2B208%2B416%2B0%250Aw%2B320%2B416%2B256%2B416%2B0%250Aw%2B464%2B416%2B384%2B416%2B0%250Aw%2B208%2B416%2B176%2B416%2B0%250Ai%2B176%2B192%2B176%2B80%2B0%2B1%250Aw%2B464%2B80%2B544%2B80%2B0%250Aw%2B464%2B416%2B544%2B416%2B0%250Ap%2B544%2B80%2B544%2B192%2B1%2B0%250Aw%2B176%2B192%2B176%2B416%2B0%250Aw%2B544%2B192%2B544%2B416%2B0%250A370%2B384%2B80%2B384%2B160%2B1%2B0%250Aw%2B464%2B80%2B384%2B80%2B0%250A187%2B464%2B80%2B464%2B192%2B0%2B1000%2B1000000000%2B200%2B0.001%250Aw%2B464%2B192%2B464%2B416%2B1%250Aw%2B384%2B272%2B384%2B416%2B0%250Ar%2B256%2B416%2B256%2B160%2B0%2B500%250A370%2B256%2B80%2B256%2B160%2B1%2B0%250Ar%2B320%2B416%2B320%2B240%2B0%2B500%250A370%2B320%2B80%2B320%2B240%2B1%2B0%250Ar%2B384%2B272%2B384%2B160%2B0%2B250%250Aw%2B320%2B80%2B384%2B80%2B0%250A">2014</a> <br><br>  This made it possible to reset the social tension of the society from 166 V to 125 V, with the nominal value of ‚Äúdischarger into revolution‚Äù V BreakDown = 200 V. <br><br>  In general, each circuit determines the path that reduces social protest: if there is an increase in two, then the level of tension can be lowered only through the remaining or the growth of social tension can be expected. <br><br>  All values ‚Äã‚Äãof currents, voltages and resistances are given conditionally, only to demonstrate the possibility of political analysis: "All events are fictional, and coincidences are random." <br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  The simplest model of a consumer society constructed by means of the popular electric circuit simulator falstad is shown.  More precisely quite the simplest. <br><br>  The considered contours in the real consumer society have a more complex structure (branched political circuit topology).  In addition, the consumer society is heterogeneous, so for a more accurate model, it is advisable to build separate contours for each stratum (group, class) of this society. <br><br>  All this requires a more complex model, which, however, can also be implemented in a tool - simulator on the proposed approach (metamodel) "modeling the behavior of consumer society based on Ohm and Kirchhoff's laws". <br><br>  This may require additional elements: accumulations (capacitors), political oscillatory circuits, inductances, transformers, including those showing wireless connections with other circuits, for example, through ‚Äúsocio-political fields‚Äù - analogs of electro-magnetic. <br><br>  Other interpretations of current \ voltage \ resistance for sociopolitical processes can be proposed and the corresponding metamodel constructed, and on its basis a model of society has already been built. <br><br>  At the same time, existing staff elements in Falstad (and similar) may not fully allow the construction of an exact model of the socio-political process, therefore it may be necessary to either include elements (polit-resistors) specialized in the ‚Äúelectrical policy‚Äù or develop on the basis of circuit simulator specialized polit-simulator. <br><br>  Given that the falstad simulator is simple, and its program code is open, in the absence of elements with the required volt-ampere characteristic, adequate to the corresponding political element (process), you can add your own - with any (required) logic of work. <br><br>  If there are other illustrative practical examples of simulation modeling of sociopolitical processes, especially a simulator of a consumer society, please give a link. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/434824/">https://habr.com/ru/post/434824/</a></p>
