      This resource was markedly different from other similar ones in that they could easily be used without registration, the download speed was very high.  Also convenient was the ability to download files as when using a torrent client (without taking into account any rating), and download the file directly from the server.  Moreover, any file added long ago could also be downloaded at high speed. <br><br>  Source: <a href="http://it.siteua.org/%25D0%2598%25D0%25A2-%25D0%259D%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8/333858/EX_ua_%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2580%25D1%258B%25D1%2582_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BB%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9">it.siteua.org</a> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>UPD</b> : If you believe <a href="">indns.com</a> then there is no A record on the DNS server. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d25/e76/43b/d25e7643bf6a16618d16bcbce9165f90.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Registrar imena.ua previously wrote in his <a href="http://blog.imena.ua/ex-ua-%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2580%25D1%258B%25D1%2582/">blog</a> : <br><br>  Today, the largest Ukrainian information storage service EX.UA. stopped working.  In addition, the service and domain EX.UA.  Yesterday, some Ukrainian users could not get to the site, because there was a restriction of access to IP addresses. <br><br>  No details yet.  We are trying to contact the project owners. <br><br>  <b>UPD2</b> : thanks for the <a href="http://life.pravda.com.ua/technology/2012/01/31/94244/">link</a> .  I will post the translation here: <br><br>  This information was confirmed by the deputy head of the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Sergey Burlakov. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe police closed ex.ua as part of the investigation of the criminal case on part 2 of article 176‚Äú Violation of copyright and related rights, ‚Äùsaid Burlakov. <br><br>  According to him, the investigation lasted about six months and was initiated by international companies. <br><br>  "Today, a search was conducted, sanctioned by the court in office space, data centers.  A large number of computer and network equipment, about 200 servers, and more than 6000 terabytes of content are seized, "said Burlakov. <br><br>  ‚ÄúInvestigative actions are being carried out, witnesses and suspects are being questioned (16 people).  After carrying out these investigative actions, the status of these people will be established, ‚Äùhe added. <br><br>  <b>UPD3</b> : According <a href="http://mvs.gov.ua/mvs/control/main/ru/publish/article/722413">to</a> DVA of Ukraine: <br><br>  In November 2010, the American Recording Association RIAA added EX.UA to the list of the 25 largest pirated web resources in the world. <br><br>  Operatives found that the administration of the resource was headed by a citizen of Latvia.  Now 16 employees of the company's office are being questioned, and the seized equipment has been sent for examination.  How many people will be brought to justice in the investigation of this criminal case will become clear after the necessary investigative and procedural actions have been taken. <br><br>  Responsibility under the article of the Criminal Code of Ukraine, under which a criminal case was initiated, is provided in the form <i>of imprisonment for up to 5 years with confiscation of copies of works and equipment</i> . <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> in the comments asked about the list of "most-most", we answer: <br><br>  The American Recording Association (RIAA) has compiled a list of sites that contribute to the distribution of illegal music, reports <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/riaa-reports-torrent-sites-rapidshare-and-rlslog-to-us-government-101111/">TorrentFreak</a> . <br><br>  The RIAA blacklist, which contains 25 sites, includes 2 Ukrainian ones.

At the moment, the delegation of the domain has been suspended on the basis of the order of some investigator from the Pechersk district, ‚Äùhe said. <br><br>  In addition, Pesochny reported that the photographs on the website of the Ministry of the Interior do not depict the resource office.  ‚ÄúEX.UA has no office in Ukraine at all,‚Äù he said, reports TCH with reference to Interfax-Ukraine. <br><br>  Commenting on the message of the Ministry of Internal Affairs about the initiation of a criminal case on the appeal of the companies Adobe Systems Inc.  and Microsoft Corporation, Pesochny, assured that the resource has contracts with the rights holders of these companies. <br><br>  At the same time, the representative of "EX.UA" could not tell which providers are hosting the company's servers.  Previously, the resource placed its servers in the data center of Volya‚Äôs TV provider, however, the press service of the provider said that at the moment the cooperation of the provider and the resource have been terminated and there are no EX.UA servers in the Volia data center. <br><br>  Sandy added that the owner of "EX.UA" is a Western investor and in his plans - the legalization of the resource. <br><br>  Source: <a href="http://mignews.com.ua/ru/articles/100726.html">mignews.com.ua</a> <br><br><h5>  Summary </h5><br><br>  ‚ÄúFriends, as soon as we have verified information about the unavailability of the resource, we will immediately publish it on this page.

Please do not take any illegal actions against the state.  structures, everything must be solved by the mind.  Stay with us. <br><br><h5>  02/01/2012 - Official Answer # 2 </h5><br>  Right holders and police collect data about Ukrainians who post pirated content on the Internet, said Ex.ua spokesman Yuri Piskova.  Another reason, he said, could be business interests. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe rightholders told me that people came to them from the authorities and asked to speak out against us,‚Äù he says, ‚ÄúIn fact, Ex.ua cooperated with the rightholders and deleted the pirated information on the first appeal.‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúBut many copyright holders wanted to know who published this information.  This is the personal data of our visitors, they are protected by law.  Nevertheless, they found a way to get them, ‚Äùhe states. <br><br>  Adobe legal representative in Ukraine Pavel Mikolyuk noted that the company's cooperation with the resource ‚Äúwas not fruitful.‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe cannot follow every fact of placing our programs on their resource,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúEx.ua should have removed such information itself, but he didn‚Äôt.‚Äù <br><br>  Microsoft representatives yesterday were unavailable for comment - neither the head of the Ukrainian representative office nor the press office answered the calls. <br><br>  Partner of Egorov, Puginsky, Afanasyev and Partners law office, Alexei Reznikov, says that it is easy to open a criminal case against resource users in Ukraine: <br><br>  ‚ÄúTo do this, a statement of the right holder is sufficient,‚Äù he notes <br><br>  But it will be difficult to prove the guilt of a particular person, says Vladimir Yakubovsky, a senior partner at Astapov Lawyers. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt is difficult to prove that it was the person to whom this IP address was assigned that made this placement.  As a result, at the evidence level this case may come to a dead end, ‚Äùthe lawyer says. <br><br>  Source: <a href="http://www.kommersant.ua/doc/1862905">kommersant.ua</a> <br><br><h5>  Ex.ua will return to service </h5><br>  The large Ukrainian information storage service X.ua can resume its work in the coming days.  This was reported to the ‚ÄúObserver‚Äù by its own source in the Ministry of the Interior. <br><br>  According to him, the Ministry of Internal Affairs will return to the company servers seized in the framework of the criminal case on violation of copyright and related rights.  In the future, the question of the fate of the company will be considered in court. <br><br>  According to the ‚ÄúObserver‚Äù interlocutor, this decision was made after hackers attacked the official websites of the authorities.  In particular, the websites of the President of Ukraine, the Cabinet of Ministers, and the Ministry of the Interior have stopped working. <br><br>  Source: <a href="http://obozrevatel.com/technology/57182-ex.ua-opyat-zarabotaet.htm">obozrevatel.com</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/137367/">https://habr.com/ru/post/137367/</a></p>
