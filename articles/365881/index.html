This is not a step-by-step instruction, namely a list of methods, utilities, and links to understand where to dig and what to do.  For each specific method, there are already detailed documentation written by other people, so my goal is simply to put all this stuff together. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365881/">Quest Games (Quests)</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365881/">MS-DOS Games</a> <br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365881/">Source ports</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365881/">Dosbox</a> </li></ul></li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365881/">Games under Windows 3.1</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365881/">Games under Windows 95 and above</a> <br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365881/">Glide (Voodoo) only</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365881/">Without the need to use Glide (Voodoo)</a> <br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365881/">Source ports</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365881/">Patches from fans</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365881/">Compatibility Mode</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365881/">Dxwnd</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365881/">Patches to support widescreen modes</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365881/">Virtual machines</a> </li></ul></li></ul></li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365881/">Windows xp</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365881/">Console games and games with IBM-PC-incompatible computers</a> </li></ul><br><br><a name="quest"></a><h2>  Quest Games (Quests) </h2><br>  If you like old quests from <b>Sierra</b> , <b>LucasArts</b> and not only - I recommend to go first and see if there is a game you need in the list of supported <a href="http://scummvm.org/compatibility/">ScummVM</a> or <a href="http://www.residualvm.org/compatibility/">ResidualVM</a> . <br><br>  If there is a mark ‚Äú <b>Good</b> ‚Äù or ‚Äú <b>Excellent</b> ‚Äù - then download without problems, but note that the pirated russifications of the game are not always supported (for fans of licensed purity I will explain - there are no official localizations for many old games, and pirated ones were sometimes at their best).

      These programs are such alternative interpreters of game quest engines. <br><br>  ScummVM was originally sharpened for quests from <b>LucasArts</b> , but later it added support for other quests, like <b>The Neverhood</b> , <b>Toonstruck,</b> and many others.  <b>ResidualVM</b> was originally written to launch Grim Fandango. <br><br>  The implementation of both ports is under different operating systems, including Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, Android and others.  Source code is open. <br><br>  <a href="http://scummvm.org/">ScummVM website</a> . <br>  <a href="http://www.residualvm.org/">ResidualVM site</a> . <br><br><a name="dos"></a><h2>  MS-DOS Games </h2><br><a name="sourceport"></a><h3>  Source ports </h3><br>  First of all, I recommend looking for a <b>source-port</b> for your chosen game.  These include projects of two types: <br><br><ol><li>  The author of the game opened the source code of the game, and fans ported it to other operating systems, often improving it along the way, for example, adding support for high resolutions, polygonal models, more convenient controls, etc.  Example - ports Doom, Quake, Duke Nukem 3D, etc. </li><li>  Programmers-fans of the game independently disassembled the executable file and game resources, recreating the game engine from scratch, no one gave them anything.  Such products cannot formally be called a source port, since  the actual ‚Äúsource‚Äù (source code) of the original does not appear in them.  But practice is still called them that way, for it is simpler.  Example: <a href="http://openxcom.org/">OpenXcom</a> . </li></ol><br>  Where to find them?  I would recommend two ways. <br><br><ol><li>  <a href="http://www.gamesrevival.ru/">Games Revival</a> website hasn't been updated for a long time, but two hundred ports for 84 games are laid out on it.  Plus links to developer sites where you can find the latest versions of ports. </li><li>  In any search engine, type ‚Äú[game name] source port‚Äù and hope for a positive outcome. </li></ol><br><a name="dosbox"></a><h3>  Dosbox </h3><br>  The most versatile option is a <b>DOS</b> 'emulator called <b>DosBox</b> .  It is better than just a virtual machine, because, as a rule, it works faster and is sharpened specifically for game emulation.  But I do not recommend taking the <a href="http://www.dosbox.com/">official version 0.74</a> - it was last updated in 2010. <br><br>  Better use <a href="http://ykhwong.x-y.net/">DOSBox SVN Daum</a> - the freshest build with the latest patches.  It works more stable, much faster (you want to run shooters of 1995 and older - you will feel a huge difference), it‚Äôs better with compatibility, you can control emulation through menus, there is support for emulating a Voodoo three-dimensional accelerator (emulation of a Glide API), emulation of a network card, MIDI Roland MT-32 synthesizer ... In short, this version is the right choice. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.old-games.ru/wiki/DOSBox_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BB%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9">Instructions for configuring DosBox.</a> <br><br><a name="win31"></a><h2>  Games under Windows 3.1 </h2><br>  If the game is 16-bit, it will not run under the 64-bit version of the OS.  But after all, you can run <b>Windows 3.1</b> in <b>DosBox</b> !  There are ready-made assemblies of this stuff, for example, <a href="http://www.old-games.ru/utils/dosbox/">from the old-games team</a> .  Surely there are others, but I have not met. <br><br><a name="win"></a><h2>  Games under Windows 95 and above </h2><br>  Here I believe that you have <b>Windows 7</b> or higher installed on your computer.  If you are the proud owner of <b>Mac OS X</b> or <b>Linux</b> , then the following tips are unlikely to help you.  But still I recommend to look, you never know. <br><br><a name="glide"></a><h3>  Glide (Voodoo) only </h3><br>  The biggest situation in terms of problematic is to meet a game that either runs only on a <b>Voodoo / Voodoo 2</b> video card, or only shows a normal picture with them.  There are two options here: <br><br><ol><li>  Use <b>Glide-wrapper</b> - translator <b>Glide</b> instructions for video cards in <b>OpenGL / Direct3D</b> .  Support is far from 100% of games, it can affect performance.  And yet, far from the worst option.  <a href="http://www.old-games.ru/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D1%2583%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE_Glide-%25D1%258D%25D0%25BC%25D1%2583%25D0%25BB%25D1%258F%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC">Instructions for Glide emulators.</a> <br></li><li>  Buy <b>Voodoo / Voodoo 2</b> !  Today it is possible to buy these cards, and not only at auctions - they can be found in specialized stores at a price of <a href="http://www.pc-1.ru/i_shop/video/pci/A029492">300-500 rubles</a> .  Of course, you need a computer with a PCI slot (or even two if you want to use two Voodoo 2 in SLI mode), but it's worth it.  There are fan drivers for Windows XP, which are suitable for Windows 7 (maybe 8, did not check).  <a href="http://www.3dfxzone.it/dir/3dfx/voodoo2/drivers/">Site with drivers.</a> <br></li></ol><br><a name="noglide"></a><h3>  Without the need to use Glide (Voodoo) </h3><br>  Here there is a hope that the game will simply start, which happens quite often.  If not ... <br><br><h3>  Source ports </h3><br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365881/">See above.</a> <br><br><a name="winfans"></a><h3>  Patches from fans </h3><br>  The most remarkable situation is that one of the fans was able to make a patch for the game with closed source.  First of all, I recommend searching on the site <a href="http://old-games.ru/">old-games.ru</a> , then - favorite search engine. <br><br><a name="wincomp"></a><h3>  Compatibility Mode </h3><br>  Right click on the shortcut to the program -&gt; properties -&gt; tab ‚Äú <b>compatibility</b> ‚Äù.  Next, select the old OS and / or try to play around with checkboxes like ‚Äúdisable desktop composition‚Äù.  Many people ignore this opportunity, and yet a number of games can be fully launched.  The same <b>Drakan: Order of the Flame</b> in compatibility mode under Windows 7 works more stable for me than under Windows XP. <br><br><a name="dxwnd"></a><h3>  Dxwnd </h3><br>  A utility that solves many problems by replacing DirectX calls with your own.  Can help toys written under Direct X version 1 through 7.  It can work as a moderator, solves a problem with games running in 256-color mode (for example, StarCraft or Diablo 2), allows you to run games in the window that only work in full-screen mode, etc.  But it may be a good idea to squander performance, so it's worth experimenting with settings.  There are open source. <br><br>  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/dxwnd/">Original version.</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.old-games.ru/utils/soft/">Version with patches from old-games</a> - for some games it may be better, for some worse, so try both versions. <br><br><a name="winwide"></a><h3>  Patches to support widescreen modes </h3><br>  A number of old games work on modern PCs without problems, but do not support screen modes with aspect ratios other than 4: 3 - either simply do not allow them to be set, or distort the proportions of pictures in these modes (for example, characters turn into plump dwarfs).  As a rule, this problem can be solved by digging in the executable file of the game, even without having the source code.  I recommend the <a href="http://www.wsgf.org/">Widescreen Gaming Forum</a> site here, he never let me down once when I was looking for similar patches. <br><br><a name="virtualmachine"></a><h3>  Virtual machines </h3><br>  The most versatile and at the same time problematic (IMHO!) Way is to use a full-fledged virtual machine, for example, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx%3Fid%3D3243">Microsoft Virtual PC 2004</a> .  Install the virtual machine, install the necessary OS on the virtual hard disk ... a theoretical idyll.  Main problems: <br><ol><li>  Serious loss of performance. </li><li>  Lack of normal three-dimensional acceleration when installing the OS below Windows XP </li></ol><br>  You can also recall that in Windows 7 and above (but not in all editions) there is already a built-in ‚Äúvirtual Windows XP‚Äù mode, in fact, the same Virtual PC with the already installed image.  But usually problems arise with games that aren‚Äôt normally launched in XP, and Windows 95 or 98 emulation is required. That‚Äôs why I gave the above link to the 2004 edition - later versions of the version are getting worse support for older OSes.  But as an extreme option for a certain number of games, it will go. <br><br><a name="winxp"></a><h2>  Windows xp </h2><br>  If you are a happy owner of this OS - then, firstly, you will not get problems with old games using 256-mode, and a number of old games under Windows will start without problems. <br><br>  And secondly, you can directly run DOS games (if you have a 32-bit version of the OS).  In this case, I recommend installing the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/vdmsound/">VDMSound Project</a> utility.  It improves sound card emulation and in general is a very useful alternative for DosBox.  But for later OS is not suitable. <br><br><a name="console"></a><h2>  Console games and games with IBM-PC-incompatible computers </h2><br>  Everything is usually simple and pleasant: download the emulator, the image of the cartridge / floppy with the game, run the first one and load the second one into it.  Sometimes you also have to download the BIOS (bypassing copyright restrictions on the part of developers) and plug-ins (when the emulator is the kernel, and for video / audio / IO subsystems the code is written separately). <br><br>  Most consoles are up to the 4th generation inclusively (up to the <b>Sega Mega Drive</b> inclusively) And early 8/16 bit PCs are almost perfectly emulated.  So if you're a <b>Famicom</b> fan, <b>Atari 2600</b> or <b>ZX Spectrum</b> , everything will go just fine. <br><br>  Consoles of the 5th generation (for example, <b>Sony PlayStation</b> or <b>Nintendo 64</b> ) are usually emulated well, but not without exceptions. <br><br>  Emulation of consoles 6 and subsequent generates an exception rather than a rule ( <b>Sony PlayStation 2</b> , for example, is emulated more or less decently, only a computer is needed powerful; the <b>Xbox</b> is <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cxbx">almost nothing</a> ). <br><br>  Most emulators and plugins <a href="http://www.emu-land.net/">can be found here</a> . <br>  Separately, it is worth noting the all-in-one emulator <a href="http://www.libretro.com/">RetroArch</a> , which contains a pack of emulators under one shell.  True, for my taste, it is configured more difficult than other, highly specialized emulators.  But at the moment it is the fastest and most compatible PS1 emulator for Android. <br><br>  Found a mistake in the tips or instructions?  Do you know any other way?  Write in a personal or in the comments, the post will be added. <br><br>  PS Dear UFO!  If you consider any of the advertising links (although I did not set such goals), delete only it, have pity on the post. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365881/">https://habr.com/ru/post/365881/</a></p>
