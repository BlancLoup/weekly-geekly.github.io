A story about how NOT to start your own business.  The tragic story of the collapse of plans and relationships.  A story with quite an ordinary beginning and a rather funny ending. <br><br>  It was a <s>rainy fall</s> a year and a half ago.  It was the eighth year of study at the university.  For eight years of study, I studied and safely forgot: mate.  analysis, basic pedagogy, features of social work with drug addicts and much more ... <br><br>  Fortunately, knowledge remained in the baggage of knowledge: Photoshop proficiency, quite good knowledge of PHP and JS, HTML-layout skills (both block and tabular - after 8 years, things change a lot).  There was a good experience in freelancing, in dubious desks, in large advertising agencies ... and even Chaldeans in off-site banquets.  So ... what am I talking about? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Oh yes!  It was the 8th year of study at the university.  Classes ended, I began to write a diploma.  Along with the diploma came the understanding that I want some kind of financial stability.  I decided to get a job.  Yes, it is Work with a capital letter.  So that everything pleases me there so that they pay enough so that there is a good friendly team.  Well, a lot more to.  I am well aware that it is rather difficult to find such a Job, I got involved in one company, engaged in the development and promotion of websites.  The company was part of a large holding and did not look like a dubious desk.  They took me to the position of designer-maker-programmer, etc.  In short, all in one.  They did not promise to pay much, but the work was close to home ‚Äî not bad savings on lunch and transport.  Contrary to my fears, everything was going quite well.  For six months, my salary has increased by 2 times.  I had my own ‚Äúdepartment‚Äù - I, the designer and coder.  In the workbook appeared proud entry "The head of the department of web-design."  No signs of trouble‚Ä¶

      And then one day the company changed management.  Premiums and salary increases are over.  Working conditions have deteriorated.  Relations with the leadership left much to be desired.  I began to think.  I thought a lot.  About life.  About money.  About future.  Ha!  Invented!  I WILL CREATE MY OWN COMPANY!  No, well, not good?  Understanding perfectly well that it will be hard for one person, I decided to stir up the whole story with my companions.  The first one was found the next day - it was a designer from my department.  Three more "passengers" came from the managers of the company in which I worked.  We all clearly thought out.  Managers will search for customers.  My friend and I will do the work.  Profit (minus managerial interest and the cost of our work) were going to honestly divide into 5 parts.  What's next? <br><br>  And then we decided to make LLC.  Nooooo ... it's not a three-eyed kavai smile.  This is a limited liability company.  Register it was not difficult.  Through the company all the pleasure cost 10 tr.  We honestly chipped in 2000 tugriks (well, not funny, eh?), I shook my head a bit.  And lo and behold!  We had our mega-super corporation.  No matter how surprising the founder (the only one) was me.  What then of course I regretted.  And off we go ... <br><br>  In the first week one of the managers fell off.  Just scored on everything.  Then in the second week.  Do you think it made me think about something?  Well no.  I spat on them! <br><br>  Incidentally, I also worked at work with my designer.  There was no time for any organizational and bureaucratic moments.  There was no one to search for customers.  And we decided to quit the ‚Äúfriend‚Äù.  I quickly made a statement.  He was signed.  Not without persuasion, of course, but signed.  The designer said that he quit at the end of the month.  Turned out.  Trips to banks, notaries, accounting firms, etc.  ate my time as longolier.  A week later, I find out the most unpleasant news: <s>the</s> dude's <s>inspector is going to visit us,</s> which is not easy.  He stupidly sat in my place.  About any dismissal, he did not even think.  I am left alone.  One on one with the cost of accounting, taxes, banking services, etc., etc., etc. <br><br>  For three months, a couple of customers happened.  It turned out a little money, which for the most part went to expenses.  So what?  It is necessary to live on something ... I got a job again.  To a small website company.  Well, I can not do anything else!  I do not know how!  He worked there as a developer for several months.  I learned a lot - thanks to the company ****** for that.  After that I was called to work at the holding, from whose company this story began.  Serious salary, prospects, etc.  etc. <br><br>  During the following months, some orders from friends, acquaintances, relatives appeared periodically.  My "Firmochka" paid for itself.  But in reality, I was already more strained than pleased.  Inquiring how much it costs to close an LLC, I was really upset.  And here‚Ä¶ <br><br>  And then there was a funny ending, promised at the beginning of the story.  The holding began to absorb small market players by acquiring them.  Tadam!  I sold my company to my management.  Shovel.  Well, really not funny?  Actually, that's the whole story.  I do not know why you all read it.  I do not know why I wrote all this.  I just wanted to share my experience. <br><br>  In fact, everything is not so simple, and the story does not end there ... but this is already my little secret.  Maybe later ... after the n-th number of months (years, decades), you will learn the continuation ... <br><br>  <b>Moral from <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/iamzet/" class="user_link">Iamzet</a></b> : <br>  And the moral of this story, in my opinion, is this: in order to seriously start your own business, at least two things are necessary: <br><br>  A reliable team, at least three or four people with sufficient qualifications, ready to deal with the business seriously, and not ‚Äúoptional‚Äù, in their spare time.  One is not a warrior in the field, any serious work will not pull, the team is a pledge that the commitments made can be fulfilled.  The ‚Äúbad‚Äù team of random people will fall apart at the very first setbacks or successes.  Or even just as in the described case. <br><br>  We need a kind of "business plan".  Understanding where and how to earn enough money for life.  Not in the distant bright future, but right here and now, at least 2-3 months in advance.  Then there may be ups and downs, but the beginning must be predictable.  This can be a ‚Äúportfolio of projects‚Äù that can really be obtained, or some kind of innovation, under which to really get financing, again, it should be clear where and how. <br><br>  Both conditions must be met together.  A team without a job, waiting for something to settle down, is doomed to decomposition.  And vice versa, the situation when a project begins the search for at least someone who does it is likely to end with a one-time job. <br><br>  To develop a business started, you will need many more things.  The company should have some kind of zest (dumping price is not considered such), distinguishing it from others, you need to build and nurture good relations with existing and potential customers and so on and so forth.  But this is a separate issue.  In addition, we must understand that a lot of money on the development of an order to make money is very difficult, one might say, impossible. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> Reread.  Some points decided to clarify. <br>  1. There was no investment.  There was some free money in the region of 5-6 thousand rubles, which could be spent without damage to life. <br>  2. Now I have nothing to do with the sold business. <br>  3. Almost half a year did not communicate with the guy.  Now again, best friends.  Understand everything.  Understand each other. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/41549/">https://habr.com/ru/post/41549/</a></p>
