  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to make a good box for software</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Despite the massive development of the Internet in our country, more than 90% of software sales in Russia for home users are sold offline - in the form of boxes, CDs and DVDs, etc.  For example, sales of boxed versions of ESET NOD32 Antivirus - make up somewhere between 95-97% of the total.  And although online sales are gaining momentum, in absolute terms it is still insignificant volumes.  A similar situation is observed in some other countries.  For example, in Italy, Poland, Africa, people also prefer to buy boxes with antivirus.  But, let's say, in the USA, Hungary, England, France, more than 60% of anti-virus software sales go through the Internet. <br><br> <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/lilit-saint/view/298726/"><img height="300" width="399" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2aa/cdb/8f9/2aacdb8f9569b703b08eeb52de405cc4.jpg"></a> <br>  <i>Now 5 boxes NOD32 withstand the load in the 1st CEO (100 kg with shoes)</i> <br><br>  Selling online faster, often cheaper, because there are no costs for transportation and storage of products, and safer, so there is less risk of theft or damage to property.  In general, a huge amount of advantages, if not for one big ‚Äúbut!‚Äù - In Russia, they prefer to buy boxes (only ESET sold more than 500,000 boxes and ‚Äústretch cards‚Äù last year).  At the same time, almost 80% of Internet users in Russia say that it is more convenient to buy on the Internet, but ... still go to ION, Eldorado and other stores.

      <b>That is why packaging requires great attention!</b> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  For different countries, ESET produces different box formats.  This is due to the traditions, the size of commercial equipment and so on.  NOD32 boxes in Poland are about 1.5 times more than in Russia, and in India - 2 times less (as an average book).  The ‚Äúnative‚Äù Slovak box is generally made in the form of a cardboard folding bed for a disk.  By the way, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/eset/blog/63174/">we were the first</a> in Russia to start printing and selling scratch cards for extending the antivirus for a second year or more.  This was suggested by our partner, <a href="http://www.key.ru/">the Computer-Center KEY</a> St. Petersburg company.  Following us, the initiative was picked up by other manufacturers of antivirus software.  In principle, the buyer does not need a box - the file can be downloaded online, the instructions too.  Only a key is needed, so the scratch card is perfect, but this format is just beginning to take root.  The user wants to buy something real, not virtual. <br><br>  <b>Design, general recommendations</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Your 20-30% box will not be placed facing the customer, but sideways, the back side, etc. Therefore, the product name must be on ALL 6 faces.  You also need to specify what kind of product it is - a game, an antivirus, etc.  If you think that your software is known to everyone, then it is not.  For example, we sell many times more boxes than Dr.WEB or Symantec, but the awareness of these brands is still higher, as they are longer on the Russian market </li><li>  In most stores there are no consultants, the buyer either takes what he knows (a well-known product) or reads the packaging.  Therefore, let the box be the maximum useful information about the product - awards, advantages, differences from competitors, etc. These data will also be useful to sellers. </li><li>  Do not forget to place the barcode and other required information (address, telephone, etc.) </li><li>  For sale in the CIS countries it is better to translate some of the information into other languages.  Usually - in Kazakh and Ukrainian, as there is at least some kind of software market. </li><li>  As long as the box reaches Irkutsk (it‚Äôs like Portugal), it will be thrown 5 times and kicked.  Therefore, it is necessary to ensure the strength of the structure - insert frame - corrugated insert. </li><li>  The box must withstand both frontal and vertical load, because in stock other goods are piled on it </li><li>  Use free disk space.  We are recording a customization video on it (15-20% less activation requests), wallpapers, instructions.  Also there you can place another software. </li><li>  Place the activation key so that the user can easily notice it, and not throw it away with the package. </li><li>  Carefully consider the size of the box.  Every centimeter is money: storage, transportation, manufacture of boxes, promotional racks, etc. </li><li>  Buy ALL boxes of competitors and colleagues, open and see what you liked and what did not.  Wash them, leave, pour water.  In general, test the strength and draw conclusions </li><li>  If possible, the color of your box should be different from the color of competitors.  True, if you have already patented a logo, etc., then problems may arise.  For example, in the Russian Federation there are a lot of green boxes of antiviruses; therefore, ESET has made white packaging for its new product. </li><li>  Carefully read what competitors are writing and think about what information about the product and the company you also need to specify.  For example, for which versions of Windows your software is suitable (new or that will be released soon).  You can also indicate the presence of round-the-clock technical support, etc. </li><li>  Make the first print run small ‚Äî it's better to overpay than to find mistakes and re-stick stickers or destroy all boxes altogether.  Errors will be 100% verified! </li><li>  It is necessary to provide for the construction of the liner in such a way that the disc does not dangle inside the box. </li></ul><br><br> <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/lilit-saint/view/298725/"><img height="300" width="400" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1c3/f88/56a/1c3f8856a0b2277fed4198946023f80d.jpg"></a> <br>  <i>Branded boxes for boxes ESET</i> <br><br>  <b>Data protection</b> <br><br>  Licenses steal, alas, it is.  More often than not, shop personnel ‚Äî shopkeepers, warehouse workers, and others ‚Äî commit thefts.  The box is opened, the username / password is rewritten and put back.  Then the buyer can not register the product, because he is already activated by someone else. <br>  What to do? <br><br><ul><li>  Stickers can be used, just make sure that they cannot be stuck again.  The sticker should be torn and leave traces on the box. </li><li>  It is more expensive, but it is more efficient to use cellophane on top, as on cigarettes - with a tear line.  And the box is not dirty and protection is.  Plus the packaging is not afraid of moisture </li></ul><br>  ESET prints packaging for DVDs that are almost impossible to fake.  Cardboard is glued to the box under pressure.  We understand that it is very expensive, but reliable.  Plus, such a disk is convenient and pleasant to store. <br><br>  <b>How to save</b> <br><br>  If you save 1 ruble on the box, then for the year you can get 500,000 rubles of profit (for example, we took our sales)!  And if 5 or 7 ... <br><br><ul><li>  The entire contents of the box can be made black and white.  The savings are not very big, but there are </li><li>  Instead of a box for a disc, you can take a simple paper envelope. </li><li>  The instruction can not be printed or short, and placed on a full disk. </li><li>  You can use the cheapest cardboard (dark) paper.  But do not overdo it! </li><li>  You can reduce the thickness of the box.  However, the "face" is better not to reduce, so as not to be less than that of competitors. </li><li>  You can not print a corrugated liner, but instead develop a more durable construction and take a more dense cardboard </li><li>  It is important to remember - the less ‚Äúparts‚Äù, the cheaper the assembly </li><li>  You can not pack the box in cellophane, but then you need to come up with another way to protect against theft and keep the appearance </li><li>  Ask the box suppliers what else can be done. </li><li>  Do not order the boxes in Moscow - very expensive, and the quality, to put it mildly, is lame.  For a regional supplier, you will become a large customer, he will be able to give you a loan, help with storage and logistics. </li></ul><br>  However, ESET does not use much of this list, since we are ready to invest in the packaging for our product to be at its best.  In addition, all materials used in the creation of our packaging are as environmentally friendly as possible and are recyclable, including plastic.  We do not use foil. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/66515/">https://habr.com/ru/post/66515/</a></p>
