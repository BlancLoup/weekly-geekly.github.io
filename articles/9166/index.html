      <b>Q:</b> When you changed your name to Apple Inc.  people wondered if you were leaving the personal computer market.  Is it so? <br>  <b>A:</b> No, says Jobs, and focuses on the commitment to the computer market and praises Apple's upcoming OS - Leopard. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  <b>12:25</b> <br><br>  Jobs says Apple plans to launch an iPhone in late June. <br><br>  <b>Q:</b> Like on the last day of the month? <br>  <b>O:</b> (laughing) Yes, it is possible. <br><br>  <b>Q:</b> Why did Cingular decide on an iPhone deal? <br>  <b>A:</b> There were two reasons for this: music playback was not yet properly implemented on phones, with iPods (perhaps iPhone was meant) users will be able to.  The second reason: companies have invested a huge amount of money in the development of 3G class networks, but they do not have devices that users could really use.  The current phones represent the ‚Äúchildish possibilities‚Äù of Internet access.  Probably, the iPhone will provide "non-children's opportunities." <br><br>  <b>Q:</b> Are there any undeclared iPhone features you would like to share with us today? <br>  <b>O:</b> (smiles) Nooo! <br><br>  Editor's Note (not me): Damn! <br><br>  <b>12:35</b> <br><br>  <b>Q:</b> Was the record industry open letter about DRM a ‚Äúrun in front of train‚Äù type of maneuver to take the lead in opposition to DRM that was already lining up? <br>  <b>A:</b> Jobs declined to answer, saying that people already downloaded a huge amount of unprotected music they listened to from other resources. <br><br>  Jobs: The iPhone is the best iPod we made. <br><br>  <b>Q:</b> Why is there no keyboard on the iPhone, while RIM and Palm have shown that they are needed?  In Cupertino, there was no one who would question this idea? <br>  <b>A:</b> No ... Once you learn to trust the keyboard, it will become your best friend.  I put dinner on the fact that you love it. <br><br>  <b>12:40</b> <br><br>  <b>Q:</b> Why did Apple succeed in the portable player market? <br>  <b>A:</b> Because Japanese consumers can produces great software.  That is why Apple is enjoying the success of the iPod.  If you look at the phones, you will see that the situation is the same.  Manufacturers have hardware, but they cannot choose the right software.  The iPhone is this great software wrapped in great hardware, and its software has gone five years ahead, compared to everything else that is available now. <br><br>  Wow.  Jobs says that the iPhone uses a real version of OS X, a real Safari, and a real mail client. <br><br>  <b>Q:</b> If, as you say, it uses real OS X, will other applications written for it work? <br>  <b>A:</b> No.  They are not intended for this. <br><br>  <b>12:45 pm</b> <br><br>  Oh, a little announcement regarding Apple TV.  Interestingly, considering that Jobs said that this is just a hobby. <br><br>  5 dollars, says a man in a sweater with a collared collar, and you can use it over the Internet. <br><br>  Now Jobs shows an animated cartoon trailer Ratatouille on stage using Apple TV. <br><br>  Here it is.  ‚ÄúYou can also buy TV shows,‚Äù Jobs says and selects a segment from the Office series.  He says that the main thing in this product is not that you can transfer anything from your computer.  ‚ÄúWouldn't it be great if you can watch YouTube right on your TV?‚Äù <br><br>  Apple will provide a free software update, which will be released in June, and will allow Apple TV users to watch YouTube videos on their TVs. <br><br>  <b>12:55</b> <br><br>  <b>Q:</b> Have you ever thought about using this kind of material under the Apple brand? <br><br>  Great: Darwin Award for Best Attempt.  (Note: Jobs ignored this question) <br><br>  <b>Q:</b> Walt asked what permission we are talking about.  Does Apple TV use anything that would improve the quality of the transmitted image?  Apparently - no. <br>  <b>A:</b> You have what you have. <br><br>  Jobs says that Apple TV is not a desktop device and is not a substitute for it.  This is something like a DVD player for the Internet generation. <br><br>  <b>1:05</b> <br><br>  <b>Q:</b> How many copies of iTunes have been downloaded? <br>  A <b>:</b> A lot.  More than iPods sold. <br><br>  <b>Q:</b> Walt notes that this makes him the most common product in the world, and he dominates Windows machines.  This makes Apple the largest software developer for Windows. <br><br>  Walt is watching the reaction. <br><br>  <b>A:</b> Yes, that's right ... It's about how to offer a glass of ice water to people who are in hell.  (comment strong statement) <br><br>  <b>Q:</b> Is the video successful on portable devices? <br>  <b>A:</b> Jobs once said that consumers don't need portable video.  He says he was skeptical about this, but consumers have proven to him that he is wrong.  Video for iPod sells very well.  ‚ÄúPeople watched a huge amount of videos on iPods,‚Äù notes Jobs.  "The video has come to stay on portable devices." <br><br>  <b>Q:</b> Will the iPhone allow video downloads? <br>  <b>A:</b> No.  It makes no sense to download videos in this way.  Delivery of material in this way is very expensive. <br><br>  <b>1:10</b> <br><br>  Go to the blitz poll. <br><br>  <b>Q:</b> Why does the iPhone use 2.5G technology at the time when 3G is already in use? <br>  <b>A:</b> Jobs replies that it seems to him that using 3G is not advisable.  He praises the iPhone's WiFi detection feature, which alerts the user to a nearby access point.  He says that WiFi is profiling, and its speed is faster than 3G. <br><br>  <b>1:15</b> <br><br>  <b>Q:</b> Is the iPhone platform unopened?  Will it be open to software developers in the future? <br>  <b>A:</b> This is a security issue, but Apple is looking for a way to give developers the ability to create an application for it.  Jobs says that he does not want the iPhone to become one of those phones that hang several times a day.  He adds: "We would really like to solve this problem, and if you wait a bit, we will do it." <br><br>  <b>1:20</b> <br><br>  <b>Q:</b> Jobs got stuck on reading the blog of the ‚Äúleft‚Äù Steve Jobs. <br>  <b>A:</b> "I do not write it ... Maybe it's Walt?" <br><br>  Photos from Steve Jobs interview on D5: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/d5e/469/92b/d5e46992b310099f0d92fe9672285c8d.jpg" width="300" height="450" vspace="10"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/d25/5c4/bdb/d255c4bdb89056a874173858455b6585.jpg" width="450" height="300" vspace="10"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/f90/f7e/39a/f90f7e39a4872526e5e5eb7b45f4228d.jpg" width="450" height="300" vspace="10"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/9c7/59e/a4a/9c759ea4a39ff12702081bb0f5908f34.jpg" width="300" height="450" vspace="10"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/d05/2f4/812/d052f481229dc6ebf6bb43307cf7a48a.jpg" width="450" height="300" vspace="10"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/d1b/e20/bbd/d1be20bbd2c7e6e7075e62f81eb1a31f.jpg" width="450" height="300" vspace="10"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/031/1ea/831/0311ea831432d313b72a21b6d7176415.jpg" width="450" height="300" vspace="10"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/10c/39c/88b/10c39c88b9cd45e0fda69b285583c8ba.jpg" width="450" height="300" vspace="10"><br><br>  <a href="http://d5.allthingsd.com/20070530/steve-jobs-ceo-of-apple/">original interview on D5 website</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/9166/">https://habr.com/ru/post/9166/</a></p>
