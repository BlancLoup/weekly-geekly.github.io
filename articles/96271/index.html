  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Confidentiality in communication networks</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A landline phone entered my life as a means of communication somewhere in 1994 (before that I simply did not have it), and now I (and many others) cannot imagine my life without communicating on a mobile phone and via the Internet.  It is very convenient to be always in touch, you can always contact a person, get his opinion on a certain issue, coordinate actions, share impressions.  But not everything is as beautiful as it seems at first glance. <br><br>  So there were circumstances that I witnessed a situation in which a person suffered from a breach of the confidentiality of his personal communication through communications.  In particular, via SMS and the Internet (mail, IM).  If everything is clear with the Internet, hackers are ‚Äúunmeasured‚Äù there, you need to worry about your protection yourself, then I‚Äôve encountered the violation of the confidentiality of personal communication via SMS for the first time.  My topic is about the protection of subscriber rights of communication operators on the confidentiality of communication. <br><br><img src="http://mobile-fan.org.ru/wara.jpg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a>

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      <br>
      In a situation that I encountered, the object of attention of attackers is far from IT, IB and is not even an ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù PC user.  But understanding that everyone can be in such a situation, I understand that I can somehow protect my communication via the Internet (VPN, SSL, PGP, etc), what about the mobile connection?  The subscriber, however advanced it may be, is extremely limited in remedies, and the use of many of them ( <a href="http://www2.rohde-schwarz.com/en/products/secure_communications/voice_and_data_encryption/TopSec_Mobile.html">audio encoders</a> , for example) is prohibited by law and, according to experts, is monitored by the relevant services. <br><br>  I can only speculate on how the confidentiality of conversations is violated - monitoring the broadcast or unauthorized use of <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%259E%25D0%25A0%25D0%259C">SORM</a> systems.  In this situation, it is known that the interest of the ill-wisher is not related to legal issues or commercial activities (its manifestations clearly indicate this).  The situation I‚Äôm talking about was most likely a consequence of a lot of circumstances, but if someone can easily intercept personal conversations, then making it a tool of fraud or blackmail is easier than ever.  And it would be fine if the security departments would violate the confidentiality of conversations (they have such a job), but private individuals do it. <br><br>  The question that remains open to me is how to protect my privacy rights of communication through communication networks?  How to find an attacker in case of violation of these rights?  What are the legal aspects of this question?  What is the responsibility of the operator, for violation of confidentiality?  How to prove to the operator or the relevant authority that such a fact takes place?  I have big doubts that, for example, an SMS received from an ill-wisher will be real (?) Evidence of a breach of confidentiality. <br><br>  And the most interesting.  If now things are in this way, then what should we expect in 5 years? <br><br>  Bomb: If it is rude, then the facts of breach of confidentiality were of this nature - there are people of one social circle: Alice, Bob, Charlie.  Alice sends SMS to Bob, then Charlie receives this SMS with comments from the unknown Dave (priayd).  Such action is not in the interests of any of the first three persons, which precludes their participation. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/96271/">https://habr.com/ru/post/96271/</a></p>
