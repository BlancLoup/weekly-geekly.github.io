The play is written in the form of a dialogue between father and son and is devoted to what people can create with each other under the guise of scientific and technological progress.  The collection, from which the play was taken, was printed in a ridiculous circulation of two hundred copies, did not lay out on the Internet, so it is unlikely that any of the residents of Habrovsk had met my beloved "Grandma ..." before.  We assume that for the first time I present a relative to the general public. <br>  At the end of the play - a sociological survey on a given topic: to what extent are scientists responsible for what happens to their inventions afterwards?  Is it fair enough to do your job without thinking about anything, or is it sometimes necessary to think, especially if you are a scientist and inventor?  and, in general, how does a scientific activity relate to morality? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  The grandmother did not die - she was disabled livelihoods </h4><br>  - Daddy, and I die? <br>  - What are you, son!  Of course, you will not die ... <br>  - Never ever? <br>  - Never ever.  Since people have conquered death, none of the people have died. <br>  - Why did grandmother die? <br>  - The grandmother did not die - her vital activity was turned off.  If people had not disconnected vital activity from time to time, the earth would have been overpopulated.  People would not have enough drinking water and ice cream, stocks of chips and canned peas dried out, and the biotoilets were completely clogged.  Awful unsanitary conditions would be created on our planet.  In order for subsequent generations to live actively and hygienically, our grandmothers have disabled livelihoods.  So it goes, son. <br>  - What is it - disable livelihoods? <br>  - How would you better explain ... Open the "Service" option in the upper corner of your eyeball.  Click on the "Life Support" item - a pop-up window will appear. <br>  - Yes I see. <br>  - What does it show? <br>  - Life support is normal. <br>  - And when your life activity is turned off, it will be written there: life activity has ceased.  But you will not feel it.  The window just goes out and that's it. <br>  - Will it break? <br>  - No, it will not break.  He is extinguished by angels <br>  - Angels? <br>  - Yes, angels, didn‚Äôt they tell you in kindergarten?  When a little man comes out of the light from his mom's tummy, eye communicators with angelic interface are implanted into the retina of his right eye.  Since that time, the angels have become a part of the human body, its most reliable friend and helper, responsible for life support and communication with the outside world.  Angels wake you up in the morning and put you to bed in the evening, remind you of unlearned lessons and shoes not cleaned, make sure that you do not use coarse expressions.  Thanks to the angelic communicator, you can turn on beautiful music in your ear, send a message to parents, contact a school friend through a thought conference. <br>  ‚ÄúWell, I know that ...‚Äù <br>  - And when a person grows old, the angels will try again: they will disable human life activity, they will call the recycling team ... <br>  - Dad, I'm scared.  And what if the angels turn off my livelihoods now? <br>  - What are you, son, do not be afraid of angels ... They are good. <br>  - Good? <br>  - Of course, good. <br>  - Why did my grandmother turn down livelihoods, if they are kind? <br>  - The grandmother was old.  She was fifty-five years old, that's how old she was.  In addition, our grandmother was in the third labor category.  And among the workers of the third labor category, life activity is supposed to be turned off at fifty-five years.  So the angels did the right thing, in full compliance with the Labor Code. <br>  - Dad, do angels in all people live off? <br>  - Absolutely everyone.  Even the president. <br>  - President? !!! <br>  - Even with him. <br>  ‚ÄúIs our president as old as grandma?‚Äù <br>  - That you are much older ... Now he is three hundred and sixty-five years old, if I'm not mistaken. <br>  - So old ?! <br>  - Is it old ?!  Very, God give him all health, toned and youthful president.  Every morning, it is wrung out twenty-five times from the floor and eleven times is pulled up on the horizontal bar.  And how much are you pulling up? <br>  - One and a half. <br>  - See!  You have someone to follow. <br>  - Daddy, when will the angels of our president turn off the livelihoods? <br>  - Shh, son ... No one knows for sure.  The statesmen of the highest labor category pass, this line is classified in the Labor Code.  I do not think in the next two hundred and fifty years.  Presidents rarely turn off their livelihoods, only in exceptional cases: if it turns out that he illegally holds the presidency or turns out to be a bad person ... And please, son, don't ask such questions in the future - they may not like it. <br>  - Who are they? <br>  - Angels. <br>  ‚ÄúDo angels hear us?‚Äù <br>  - Every word.  They not only hear, but thanks to the eye communicator and write it down.  Think three times before you say something rash.  If you annoy angels, they can send a weak electrical discharge to your eyeball.  It hurts a lot, you can believe me. <br>  - How do you know that?  Have you sent an electric discharge to the eyeball? <br>  - Well ... to be honest, then once, in his youth.  For the fact that I uttered one inadmissible phrase.  Sorry, I do not like to remember this. <br>  - And what will happen if a person is not afraid of a weak electrical discharge and will specifically begin to anger angels with impermissible words.  Well then what? <br>  ‚ÄúThen the angels will shut him off.‚Äù <br>  - How to turn off?  Even if he has a fifth labor category, how is yours? <br>  - Anyway, turn off, regardless of the employment category.  No need to get into trouble, you understand. <br>  - Dad ... <br>  - What, son? <br>  - And who are left-handed? <br>  - Who ??? <br>  - Well, lefties.  I am Andryukha in kindergarten in secret ... <br>  - Come on without names, son! <br>  - ... In kindergarten, he boasted in secret that there are such left-handers.  As if they have no options in the eye.  Even Tetris can not be set, even the alarm clock start. <br>  - Well, son ... You are already a big boy, I have to tell you.  Some people do not like it when angels turn off their livelihoods, so they pull out their right eye along with the communicator implanted in it.  In such people, angels can not disable livelihoods, and these sneaky little people with the left eye left - left-handers - continue to function. <br>  - Without an eye ??? <br>  - Yes, without the right eye.  They breathe air destined for future generations and eat food destined for future generations. <br>  - Dad, I do not understand how to eat without a communicator.  How do they order? <br>  - No, of course, because it is impossible to get food without a communicator, without a communicator you cannot even enter a public mall.  Therefore, left-handers rummage through the dustbins or go to the forests where they lead a primitive lifestyle.  In fact, they are no longer people, but beasts, primitive cowardly beasts with empty right eye sockets.  On the part of the angels, they are being systematically hunted.  Unfortunately, it is not possible to kill all left-handers, because they are very careful and secretive creatures.  Despite the fact that the one-eyed.  The renegades!  Scum!  Crafty distraught animals!  To think of this: snatch his right eye, if only they had not disabled livelihoods. <br>  - Dad, how many left-handers live? <br>  - I do not care how much they live, son.  No matter how long they live, they have no right to exist.  Damn them, once and forever! <br>  - But left-handers die? <br>  - Yes, definitely.  Death is conquered by humans, but not animals.  Having refused from planned shutdown of vital activity, left-handed people also refused from immortality, put themselves outside of human society.  Therefore, they die of hunger and fatal diseases, like ordinary animals.  Unless, of course, the angels can not catch them and send them to recycling. <br>  - And how many angels live? <br>  - Angels?  How many angels live?  What a funny question.  I have never heard of angels being shut down.  I do not know how many angels live - these data are classified.  They probably live forever. <br>  - Dad! <br>  - Sonny? <br>  - I decided now.  I also want to be an angel!  I want to hunt for left-handers, to monitor the disabling life of other people and be immortal. <br>  - It is difficult, because angels take the most worthy.  Basically, of course, children of angelic origin, but sometimes ordinary mortals.  In order for an ordinary mortal to turn into an angel, one must in no case utter impermissible phrases, be an exemplary boy and brush his teeth in the morning.  Be sure to brush your teeth in the morning!  And when you grow up, go to the Academy of your own angelic security.  Only at the end of it does an ordinary angel qualify for angelic qualification ... Wait, son, where are you going? <br>  - Brush your teeth! <br><br>  <b><i>A curtain</i></b> </div>
