  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Lithuanian DC Teo Group and its cooling system KyotoWheel</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  The company Teo Group, which is the leader of telecommunications and IT services in the Lithuanian market, has introduced a new data center.  It is located in the capital of Vilnius, the district of irm≈´nai.  New DC - energy efficient and located in the most populated area.  The server farm was assigned a Tier III reliability level, in the hope that the site would be used continuously. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b6c/4af/833/b6c4af833f7d4243acc3dc3c2cef5bc0.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a></p><br><p>  The uniqueness of this site is that it has <a href="http://www.kyotocooling.com/">KyotoCooling</a> .  With the help of this system, it was possible to achieve savings in operating costs, by means of reducing the cost of power consumption of the server cooling system compared to another data center. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/346/d61/6c2/346d616c26cd4a3a8a8b7de34927ac32.jpg"></p><br><p>  "This DC was created for the development of the Teo Group. When designing it, emphasis was placed on the reserve capacity and reliability of the infrastructure for the coming years, while taking into account the real needs. Today, a significant increase in the use and storage of data has been identified, which contributes to the rapid response centers around the world for consumer demand. At the same time, the high level of security and reliability of this DC allows us to provide services abroad. "  - Technical Director Teo Group, Andrews Symeskevius. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/329/919/3d8/3299193d8c064b9c9cc1c7099f1398fa.jpg"><br><p>  The Teo Group company is at the initial stage of its existence.  Previously, she was a state company Lietuvos Telekomas.  However, in 2008, the Scandinavian telecommunications operator <a href="http://www.teliacompany.com/">TeliaSonera</a> owns 88% of the shares. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/90a/9da/341/90a9da3417054666be2dec935b31225f.jpg"><br><p>  The data center Teo Group in Vilnius is already the eighth in a row.  About 3 million euros were spent on its creation, a local engineering firm, <a href="http://www.fima.lt/ru/">Fima,</a> worked on the construction.  At the moment, in the car.  halls to be more than a hundred server racks.  Also, DC has been awarded the Uptime Institute certificate, which is consistent with the principles of Tier III Design and Tier III Facility.  The data center has a total capacity of 500 kW, which is produced from renewable energy sources - hydropower, hydropower plants of Kaunas.  The average annual PUE ratio is 1.25 units. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1c1/923/cae/1c1923cae82d4dda83529b354c4d5c33.jpg"><br><p>  One of the main features is the use of the KyotoWheel modular free cooling system, developed by the Netherlands innovative indirect cooling system for KyotoCooling server equipment.  The uniqueness of this solution lies in the "heat wheel", which serves as a gateway and will separate the flow of outside air from the inside.  Savings on this solution is that you do not need to expend water and it all depends on the outside air temperature. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aad/ec5/320/aadec532060845d2b1029ad851e56080.jpg"><br><p>  The Teo Group company became the first client of KyotoCooling, having previously tested its system in another DC in Vilnius.  At the same time, this solution worked only in three data centers around the world.  The Dutch company KyotoCooling is currently actively promoting its products based on proprietary technologies.  This solution helps to achieve the most efficient use of air for cooling the server equipment in the computer halls of data centers.  The principle of operation of the KyotoWheel system is a large rotating horizontal heat exchanger, inside of which there are separate channels for air, which are removed from the server racks and the air entering from the outside. </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/oql1-5i9wFE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjMCwYFW3q3hfxf4J4NkSZEWz9geA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  This technology is already successfully operating in many data centers around the world, such as HP and the data center of the airline United Airlines (a suburb of Chicago, USA). </p></div>
