      If you want to know the secret of prosperity and happiness, here it is.  Tony Robbins put it in three words: <br><br>  <b>Raise your standards!</b> <br><br>  Everything.  Sounds simple enough, right?  The way it is. <br><br>  Tony says that there are 4 standards by which people live.  The first of these is the POVERTY standard.  If you do some work mediocre, what reward do you get?  Usually, you do not get anything.  No rewards. <br><br>  The next level is the standard DELIVERY.  Most people, having worked hard on something, think that they will get a good reward, right?  NOT.  If you work well, you are worthy of only a BAD promotion.  Sometimes people say: ‚ÄúI'm a good person, why did my wife leave me?‚Äù Or ‚ÄúI'm a good parent, why do my children use drugs?‚Äù Or ‚ÄúI'm a good worker, why did I get fired?‚Äù.  The problem is that you are GOOD.  This, unfortunately, is not enough, especially in our days. <br><br>  Next comes the standard of excellence, on which most of these <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/zabudte-o-postanovke-tseley/">motivated people</a> like you and me act, right?  Such people are serious about learning, growth, excellent job performance, diligence, discipline, etc. ... But the thing is: if you do a great job with your job, then you think you can count on an excellent reward ... And again, NO.  You only get a good award.  It annoys people like you and me, because we put a lot of strength and skill into something and hate getting only the good. <br><br>  The majority is sure: the level of excellence is all that they have, and there is nowhere else to strive for.  But it is not so!  There is always another level to climb.  And this standard is called CANCEL.  By following it, you stand out from the crowd.  This is a transition to your other side, where you give yourself completely.  It is at this level that the Olympic champions play.  This is the difference between the gold medalist and the participant who took the 4th place. <br><br>  What awards does an outstanding person receive?  EVERYTHING.  He gets respect, admiration, all prizes, success, and so on ... The one who got the gold gets everything, while the player who showed the 4th result in the world remains Nothing With it, only the experience of participation is in his piggy bank in the Olympics. <br><br>  We need to constantly raise our standards in all areas of life.  This is what allows us to grow and develop continuously, while experiencing a long-term feeling of happiness and satisfaction.  It is important to bypass others playing at higher standards than we do. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Devilish procedure: How to change your limiting beliefs</font> </h2><br>  The devilish procedure was invented by Tony Robbins to change any of the restrictive beliefs stopping us.  This is undoubtedly the most powerful episode of ‚ÄúUnleash The Power Within‚Äù. It changes life more than anything I have come across before.  This is what makes me come back to ‚ÄúFree your inner strength‚Äù time after time.  Thanks to the Devilish procedure, this day is called ‚Äútransforming‚Äù. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">1. Highlight a limiting belief or algorithm.</font> </h3><br>  First we need to choose 3 limiting beliefs that inhibit us right now.  Here are examples of such statements. <br><ul><li>  "I'm too young." </li><li>  "I'm too old." </li><li>  "I'm not good enough." </li><li>  "I have no time". </li><li>  "I have no education." </li><li>  "I have no money". </li><li>  "XXX People ..." </li><li>  "I am XXX ..." </li><li>  "Life XXX ..." </li></ul><br>  It is important to understand that it is our BELIEFS that control and determine every decision and deed in our lives.  The fact that you are reading this blog is based on <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/5-glavnykh-oshibok-ili-pochemu-vashi-ratsionalnye-resheniya-ne-rabotayut/">your beliefs</a> .  What you decide to wear right now is again based on your beliefs.  And any other decision you will ever make, too. <br><br>  The problem is that most beliefs are not our conscious choice.  We had some experience that made us misinterpret things and form a conviction.  Or we have adopted the beliefs of our parents in the process of growing up.  Everyone has limiting, deterrent beliefs, and the Devilish procedure was created to help everyone change them. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">2. Load yourself</font> </h3><br>  When you choose your limiting beliefs, you must ask yourself: ‚ÄúWhat negative consequences of these beliefs have I already encountered?‚Äù <br><br>  The ONLY way to change your life is to LOAD yourself.  To replace a limiting belief, you need to be associated with great, endless, unbearable pain.  You need to literally take on so much pain that the refusal of change is impossible.  During the Devilish procedure, Tony Robbins laps up the implications of these limiting beliefs from the previous 5, 10, 20 years ..., and makes us observe how they affect every area of ‚Äã‚Äãour lives.  Very powerful method. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">3. Create a new inspirational belief or alternative</font> </h3><br>  After associating a restrictive persuasion with pain, the next step is creating an inspiring opposition.  This can be done easily by finding the antithesis.  What should you believe in return?  What is the truth that will set you free? <br><br>  If the old conviction was ‚ÄúI am too young‚Äù, then the new statement should be like this: ‚ÄúYouth is passion and energy!‚Äù And if the old phrase was ‚ÄúI have no money‚Äù, the new inspirational concept could be ‚ÄúI have money for everything , what I need!" <br><br>  The key is to choose a new story or alternative so that it FACILITIES <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/8-privychek-lyuboznatelnykh-lyudey/">move forward</a> . <br><br>  Having created a new inspiring statement, we took up an exercise that helps us interrupt the old limiting belief or algorithm, and then determine a new concept or alternative.  This process, as I said, changes life more than anything I've ever experienced. <br><br>  We completed the Devilish procedure by chanting the text titled "Now I Am the Voice." <br><ul><li>  Now I have a voice. </li><li>  I will lead after myself, not follow someone. </li><li>  I will believe, not doubt. </li><li>  I will create, not destroy. </li><li>  I am fighting for Good. </li><li>  I am a leader. </li><li>  Challenge fate! </li><li>  Set a new standard! </li><li>  Get up! </li></ul><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">3 steps to mastery</font> </h2><br>  We finished the third day of the seminar ‚ÄúFree your inner strength‚Äù by talking about three steps to mastery, largely based on George Leonard's ‚ÄúMastery‚Äù. <br><br>  The road to gaining mastery in anything ‚Äî in doing work, creating relationships, maintaining family happiness, or sharing finances ‚Äî begins with the use of 3 tools.  Performing these three steps will help you achieve phenomenal results in any area of ‚Äã‚Äãlife. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">1. Copy the person who has already achieved what you need</font> </h3><br>  As mentioned earlier, the shortest way to mastering something is to search for a role model, a mentor or a coach, on which you can equal yourself.  You need to find the best, the one who has already received the desired results.  So you can turn decades into days. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">2. Full immersion</font> </h3><br>  If you want, for example, to learn Spanish, which will help you to cope with this more quickly: attend classes once a week or a week spent in Spain?  Of course, the second, because you will be immersed in the culture.  That is why seminars and events are so useful, because you immerse yourself in them, go beyond your environment and process all your beliefs and attitudes in a matter of days. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">3. Repetition at intervals</font> </h3><br>  After total immersion, you need to extend its effect by repeating at intervals.  An excellent example of this is UnleashThePowerWithin or any other seminar.  You have been imitating the best for 4 days in a row - for example, Tony Robbins - and you are in a state of complete immersion.  After ‚ÄúFree your inner strength‚Äù or some other similar event, you definitely need to get a coach or attend courses or something else on a regular basis to consolidate and absorb the material.  That is what will help you achieve mastery. <br><br>  The review of the third day of the seminar ‚ÄúUnleash The Power Within‚Äù is almost complete.  As you can guess, there was still a lot at the event that is impossible to describe in words.  I have 2 more final videos of Tony Robbins that I would like to share with you. <br><br>  I hope you enjoyed this detailed report. <br><br>  Ahead is ONE ONE day of the seminar ‚ÄúFree your inner strength‚Äù.  The fourth day is one of the most important.  Joseph McClendon III will be on the stage again and tell us about the Power of Clean Energy. <br><br>  PS We recommend another article on the topic - <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/kak-stat-vynoslivym-8-shagov-k-uspekhu-naperekor-slozhnostyam/">How to become hardy: 8 steps to success in defiance of difficulties</a> . <br><br>  The author of the translation is Vyacheslav Davidenko, founder of <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/">MBA Consult</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/303192/">https://habr.com/ru/post/303192/</a></p>
