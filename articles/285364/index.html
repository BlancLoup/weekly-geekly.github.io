"Generation P" <br><br>  Please consider this text as a Friday message with a positive connotation. <br>  Each company, faced with rapid growth, feels the need for new employees.  It's one thing when they are programmers and, in principle, people of technical specialties. <br>  It is quite another thing if a company needs a copywriter, designer or any other person with a dislocated human brain. <br>  We all came across HR work.  Including on Habr√© there was a set of polar opinions.  But as long as you do not plunge into the recruitment, you will never be able to feel all the juice and drive to find the right specialist in the current market.  The post is to some extent inspired by a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hr/115855/">different approach to employment</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Publish a vacancy </h2><br>  The theater begins with a hanger, and the search for an employee with a job description. <br>  This is like the statement of TZ designer.  It seems clear what you want at the exit, but in the TK it turns out only: ‚ÄúWe need an outrageous creative and half the sky was filled with a rainbow with the logo of our company!‚Äù <br><br>  How to describe the requirements for a person who, on the one hand, has to write a lot, beautifully, competently and well, and on the other hand is learning something new (taking into account the specifics of the company)? <br>  It turns out only in the style of Captain Obvious and Major Yasen-Khren (rare double surname, yes).

    <h2>  Looking at candidates </h2><br>  Well, half the work has been done, the vacancy has been written and published on the job site.  We start filtering incoming applications. <br>  And here such positive charge happens that just some endless Friday in the middle of the week. <br><br>  We write and directors, and employees of gambling, and people in uniform.  Everyone, absolutely everyone can write texts (well, obviously, I wrote a resume, it's already good!).  Everyone, you know, director, can creatively create and write day and night on any topics needed by the government and parties! <br><br>  It also receives a lot of feedback from applicants who have not decided who they want to be in this life.  I admit, I dreamed to be an astronaut until I was 12 (but then I fell ill with pneumonia and the cruel doctor disappointed me terribly), thought about it in time and decided on priorities. <br>  People in search of work try their best.  The vacancy of the copywriter respond (it is naturally written in the summary, it is clear that the crisis has broken many): <br><ul><li>  Manager </li><li>  Art Director </li><li>  Credit Spitsialist </li><li>  Individual entrepreneur </li><li>  Internet Project Managers </li><li>  Sales managers </li><li>  Socionics Expert </li><li>  Account Manager </li><li>  Web designers </li><li>  Deputy Assistant </li><li>  Webmaster </li><li>  Senior District Tax Specialist </li></ul><br>  There is also a significant proportion of, to put it mildly, inadequate applicants.  Touched the resume written entirely "caps".  The letters themselves are also wonderful.  With your permission, a few anonymous examples: <br><br><blockquote>  Hello! <br>  I look forward to the invitation to work! <br>  Respectfully, *** </blockquote><br><blockquote>  ... not a day without a line, not a minute without an idea, not a second without a positive !!!!! </blockquote><br><blockquote>  Hello. <br>  I was very interested in the vacancy of a copywriter in your company and I would like to try myself at the position of designer. <br>  I graduated from the International Institute of Advertising (International Institute of Advertising), the faculty of creativity and production technology in advertising, the MIR College, as well as art.  the school. <br>  Fluent English, basic German. <br>  I have good creative skills (art school) and knowledge of basic graphics programs, such as ... </blockquote><br><blockquote>  ... graduated from the faculty of journalism of the RUDN University. <br>  At the moment I am looking for a place for a stable and interesting job. I am excellent <br>  I understand cinema, fashion, literature and much more.  In this <br>  moment I am the winner of the project "*** 2010".  My dream is to become a war correspondent ... </blockquote><br><br><h2>  We invite you to join us </h2><br>  Okay, okay, having defined the candidates, sent out invitations.  Here are the mini stats: <br><ul><li>  81 responded to the vacancy </li><li>  18 invitations for an interview </li><li>  6 confirmations (the applicant called and agreed with him a convenient meeting time) </li><li>  3 visits for interview </li></ul><br>  At the same time, after the invitation and coordination of time, 1 applicant wrote and warned that he had found work. <br>  The rest just did not come. <br><br><h2>  Total </h2><br>  What I wanted to express this article. <br>  Want to find your dream job?  Follow the simple rules: <br><ul><li>  If the vacancy is a ‚Äúprogrammer‚Äù, it is not necessary to send a resume for the programmer‚Äôs job, which is sharpened for a team.  This at least makes you think about what you want in life (remember the "astronaut"). </li><li>  Write out your experience in the summary (figures, facts, links to the portfolio and examples of work).  We all know the price of beautiful words, save them for creativity. </li><li>  Write cover letters.  Often, one cover letter can express everything that will interest the employer (is it worth saying that when there are many candidates and the selection criterion is very vague - the cover letter is a good way to isolate from the crowd). </li></ul><br>  What is most interesting, this approach works wonderfully on freelancing, where the customer is the same employer, and the performer is the same applicant. <br><br>  No offense.  All matches are anonymous, but not accidental. <br>  Your K.O.  and M.YA-X </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285364/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285364/</a></p>
