The collapse of the Union coincided with the global technological breakthrough.  Computers and Network.  The information blockade of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union collapsed and in the 90s FIDOshnye ekhi, the first sites and forums, the first startups, which at that time had not yet been called this wonderful overseas word, began to appear.  Technological miracle, which caused almost a culture shock to people who grew up behind the Iron Curtain.  ‚ÄúWhat is this?‚Äù - ‚ÄúIs this a site in Eastern California?‚Äù - ‚ÄúYes?  Is it in America? ‚Äù-‚Äú Yeah. ‚Äù  Long pause. <br><br>  Throughout the rest of the world, the revolution is gaining momentum and William Gibson‚Äôs fantastic ‚Äúcyberspace‚Äù is beginning to take on tangible contours. <br><br>  However, even then it was clear that ‚Äúnot everything is in order in the Danish kingdom‚Äù.  The virtually uncontrolled growth of the Internet, the relative cheapness of organizing your own website and access to the network, the lack of censorship - all these factors indicated that informational chaos is not far off.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Umberto Eco, Italian semiotics and part-time author of popular culturological detectives (Dan Brown smokes nervously on the sidelines) <a href="http://carbon.cudenver.edu/~mryder/itc_data/eco/eco.html">in one of his interviews</a> made a prediction that people should soon appear performing the functions of searching and filtering information in network chaos for those who are less experienced. in this case.  He called them gatekeepers.  I liked this term, and in the 98th year a story was written in which I tried to give a forecast for the near future.  In the further cycle of stories, I continued the <a href="http://plazdarm.org/archives/179">‚Äúgatekeeper‚Äù theme</a> .  It was thought that in ten years from now ‚Äúinformational taxi drivers‚Äù would become a reality. <br><br>  Did not work out.  Gatekeepers did not happen.  There were bloggers with a cube cloud of terabytes of information noise.  Lytdybr, the song of akyn Mamayev, ‚Äúwhat I see, I write.‚Äù  Network diaries that have emerged at the beginning of the XXI century continue to be fruitful as ... well, there are a lot of them.  And every day more and more.  In the same Runet, there are already more than nine million of them, and yet in September of last year there were about five.  <a href="http://plazdarm.org/archives/170">The growth of the blogosphere is</a> impressive and no crises interfere with the human need for self-expression. <br><br>  However, there is still hope.  The blogospheric chaos gradually crystallizes.  Individual comrades who have gone through primary school blogging on mass services and are well-versed in this business create their own autonomous blogs on which they publish unique and in-demand content.  Yes, of course, it does not do without such chronic blogospheric sores as copy-and-piling and cheating ratings, but, nevertheless, ‚Äúfree-standing‚Äù create information that finds its consumer. <br><br>  Will freestanding gatekeepers?  Maybe not in such a format as it seemed ten years ago, but it is quite possible.  At the very least, the emergence of companies such as Weblogs, Inc give hope for a better future for the Web. <br><br>  We will live, work, we will see. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/59457/">https://habr.com/ru/post/59457/</a></p>
