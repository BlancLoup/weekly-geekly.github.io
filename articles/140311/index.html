Judge for yourself: the routes are the same, the practical control of the fuel is implemented very simply.  The whole market consisted of installing gps trackers and post-factum drawing tracks.  Over the past few years, the situation has changed radically and there is a need not only to control the movement of vehicles, cutting off left triggers, but also to introduce automatic observance of traffic schedules, count lags, etc. Read how to tackle how it was implemented and implemented. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Government money </h4><br>  Conversations in city halls that urban transport must be put in control hear everything and the process is more "sawing".  But lately, city transport authorities have begun to move from words to deeds.  Often, for carriers, this turns out to be just a nightmare: additional costs, control by the city administration and ... still the conviction that there is no benefit from such innovations.  Good intentions of city administrations are obvious - minibuses must go on schedule, they will not be crowded, they will not exceed the speed limit and you can expect your bus even if it is not economically profitable for the carrier to send it on a flight.  How and whether it will all work, time will tell, because it is impossible to take into account the interests of only one side. <br><br>  Some carriers began to contact us in order to win in the current situation: agreements were established with the executive committees that the carrier would be able to select the dispatching complex suitable for him and the city government (in terms of control and reporting) of the dispatch complex - software and equipment.

      As already mentioned in the last article, the first company that applied was the KP Kherson Municipal Transport Service.  After getting acquainted with our system, the management of the enterprise came to the conclusion that it makes sense to use a non-turnkey solution (and none of the proposals considered did not suit them fully), and together with us to create a passenger traffic management system based on the daily work of such a fleet.  That part of our service, which was focused on working with routes, was already finalized according to technical specifications drawn up by dispatchers, ATP management and regulatory authorities.  Each innovation was tested in real conditions on an already equipped vehicle and, while the next task was carried out according to plan, the employees had the opportunity to master the elements of the service and make comments on its work. <br>  This teamwork helped helped us and the customer achieve the maximum effect.  Since the service <a href="http://gps-tracker.com.ua/">gps-tracker.com.ua</a> works with equipment from various manufacturers, there were no extra costs for those whose fleets have already been equipped with third-party equipment. <br>  Such a policy provided not only savings, but also made it possible to increase profits by debugging software for the specifics of the customers. <br><br><h4>  Opportunities </h4><br>  Thanks to the new M2M-City module, our web tracker has new features: <br><br><ul><li>  automatic laying and setting of routes taking into account the geometry of roads (it‚Äôs clear here: I moved the stop - recalculated the route); </li><li>  different colors of the routes and automatic change of the color of the transport tied to them (the car on the pink route is pink); <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b1a/0a8/1dc/b1a0a81dce0ca2d70d2d23d25435f775.jpg"></li><li>  alarm speeding and timers at stops (if, for example, the bus is longer than expected); <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e7b/542/26f/e7b54226ffbc42e676718c7224acfb87.png"></li><li>  reports with reference to routes - the number of flights, the mileage on the route only, the duration of its passage without stopping, etc .; <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b69/c30/aed/b69c30aed67e0bed8a3a8b206b93abc1.png"><br></li><li>  summary and detailed reports on violations (speeding, disembarking passengers in the wrong place, travel) </li><li>  facilitation of accounting in cases of equipment malfunction; <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/be0/86a/82c/be086a82cb14f4d1b29643d0ab0d8264.jpg"><br></li><li>  the possibility of formation and rapid re-planning of schedules for both urban and intercity transport (distributed by day, week, decade, etc.); </li><li>  event planner for a long period of time for reports: assignment of transport to different routes, days off, changes in the norms of flights, schedules; </li><li>  portal for passengers with the ability to play information on electronic (smart scoreboards) scoreboards (mini web version where timetables and nearest bus routes will be available, a la m.gps-tracker.com.ua). </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Our money </h4><br>  The economic component of the module is also simple: anyone can connect three route objects to the system for free during testing.  There are no special requirements for the equipment - all that is supported by us at the moment can and will work. <br>  The subscription fee for the device, if there are more than three, is $ 2 per month.  The possibility of selling the server with this module is not planned yet, but we openly treat all offers.  We are also considering any options for cooperation with the manufacturers of both equipment and software (recently we talked with the guys who have a very promising development in the field of NFC payment acceptance). <br><br>  Stay tuned! <br>  <a href="http://www.gps-tracker.com.ua/">www.gps-tracker.com.ua</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/140311/">https://habr.com/ru/post/140311/</a></p>
