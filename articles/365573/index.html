  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Notebook Lenovo Z70-80: all tasks on the shoulder</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Residents of small apartments know how difficult it is to allocate a place for a full-fledged computer in a very limited area.  A powerful system unit, a monitor of about 27-30 inches, a full-sized keyboard is absolutely perfect, but not everyone is ready for this and, of course, not everyone needs it.  Well, there, where even a small candy bar does not fit, there will always be a place for a laptop.  Today we want to talk about our solution specifically for such cases: the Lenovo Z70-80 17-inch multimedia laptop.  Its sales in Russia began quite recently, and we took one copy from the first batch for acquaintance. <br><br> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/lenovo/blog/251010/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/84b/615/873/84b6158731c540398cc11704ed158810.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Appearance and convenience</font> </h2><br>  Any multimedia notebook with a large screen (and our Z70-80 is no exception) is a story not about records, but about the right balance.  In all.  And above all, it concerns the size of the computer.  Probably there are few lovers to wear a 17-inch laptop every day to work, but if necessary with transportation difficulties should arise.  So it is here: exactly 3 kilograms of weight and 28.3 mm of thickness is not the biggest obstacle to the desire to work behind the usual machine in an unusual situation.  The power supply is not included in the previously indicated weight, but it is very compact: the main part actually fits into a fist. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9fd/593/603/9fd5936036a54378a51dd327e34fdf00.JPG">

      But the main purpose of the Z70-80 is, of course, the role of the main home computer for everything: sit on the Internet, watch movies, play games and work.  Therefore, the laptop is firmly on any solid surfaces.  In the latter, four solid rubber feet are especially helpful. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/650/318/1e3/6503181e3f474f568f50b334d080a72c.jpg"><br><br>  The design is neutral: it doesn‚Äôt catch the eye and doesn‚Äôt evoke thoughts about space flights.  At the same time, the lid on the outside is metal, the working surface is made of the same material.  Fingerprints remain, we will not prevaricate, but, unlike soft-touch plastic, are erased easily.  Therefore, we anticipate perhaps that the questions to the glossy plastic frame around the screen.  But there's nothing to be done: what is, that is. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6a8/006/174/6a800617493b4ebdb270839776a936e0.jpg"><br><br>  The hinge mechanism is reliable, the screen part holds firmly.  Also, the computer does not fall down, if you completely flip the cover back.  And in general, using Lenovo Y70-80 as a home or office PC turned out to be very comfortable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b49/169/f1f/b49169f1f6804a81805484c083635a9f.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Connectors</font> </h2><br>  A set of connectors for a standard 17-inch laptop.  On the left side are the interface for the power adapter, VGA, RJ-45, HDMI, USB 2.0 and USB 3.0. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8af/8d8/661/8af8d86616af496ca0b298cba38fdcd2.jpg"><br><br>  On the right side are the optical drive, a combined audio jack, a card reader for SDXC / MMC and another USB 2.0.  Well, if we talk about wireless connections, Bluetooth 4.0 and Wi-Fi 802.11 a / b / g / n at 2.4 GHz are supported. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fff/0f0/460/fff0f0460faa4d929353216d6d3b04ce.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Screen</font> </h2><br>  Image quality in a multimedia laptop is one of the fundamental things.  The screen diagonal in the Lenovo Z70-80 is 17.3 inches, and the resolution is 1920x1080 pixels.  It is based on an IPS panel with wide viewing angles and a color gamut close to sRGB.  If necessary, you can work with graphics at a level above the amateur.  Another important point - the complete lack of gloss, a matte laptop screen, there is an anti-reflective coating.  The stock of brightness is not the highest in the class, but it is hardly necessary to complain about its lack. <br><br>  And the most important thing, of course, is the complete lack of desire to constantly flip the cover away or sit higher or lower so that the image looks better.  And in general, you don‚Äôt think much about the screen - it just does an excellent job with its task and produces a good image. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Input Devices</font> </h2><br>  This text, of course, is printed on Lenovo Z70-80.  The laptop keyboard is full-sized, good dimensions allow integrate it into it.  To the left and right of the touchpad there is a lot of space so that you can comfortably place your wrists.  The keyboard panel is very durable and does not flex during printing.  But when it came to general testing in a text editor, the opinions in our office were a little divided.  Everyone liked the matte keys, but not everyone was pleased with the long button stroke, although, of course, this is a matter of taste.  In addition, you should know that they are not concave here, as on the keyboard of the ThinkPad line of laptops. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e84/b25/013/e84b250132e24b4aae7a91a96f5d6bfe.jpg"><br><br>  The touchpad is also matte, and it perfectly recognizes all the actual gestures for Windows 8.1.  And, more importantly, the positioning accuracy is excellent: the experts suggest that with a very big desire, you can work with this even in Photoshop, that is, it is really good.  Below the touchpad are two buttons that replace the left and right mouse buttons.  Their move is also quite short.  Practice has shown that you can get used to this feature very quickly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/164/882/8c1/1648828c1dfd46009c70b13354f2314c.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Iron</font> </h2><br>  The configurations of the Lenovo Z70-80 are few, and they sent us from the warehouse not the weakest: with an Intel Core i5-5200U processor with a base frequency of 2.2 GHz, two cores and an integrated HD5500 graphics.  This CPU of the Broadwell family in terms of performance exceeds the Haswell processors of the previous generation by about 10-15%.  Basically, he, of course, is focused on more compact machines, but in the Z70-80 he feels rather well.  Well, if you compare the integrated graphics Intel HD 5500 with the previous generation, the performance gain in some tasks can reach 25%. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/33b/ebe/dc8/33bebedc823748458a8de4f982d6c7a8.jpg"><br><br>  But the discrete graphics adapter, of course, as always, is more interesting.  In this case, this is a mid-range solution - NVIDIA GeForce 840M based on the Maxwell architecture with two gigabytes of memory.  The configuration in the end is not a game, but even with such an iron, playing good games with a decent level of quality is a reality.  We launched on the Z70-80 Wolfenstein: The New Order and Total War: Attila.  In the first case, even in Full HD at medium settings it was quite pleasant to play (25-32 fps), although many people say that this project is not very well optimized.  If you reduce the resolution to HD, then the spread of fps will be from 30 to 60 frames per second.  The strategy from SEGA is "heavier", so in Full HD at medium settings delays occurred more often (21-25 fps). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/16b/4b3/0b8/16b4b30b8af04a579bb424589e0d67a7.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/454/65e/805/45465e8053524467895d2c168127565b.jpg"><br><br>  For clarity, we compare in the table the performance of our Z70-80 modification with the gaming Lenovo Y50-70: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b18/631/558/b18631558da6488db193dac772264214.png"><br><br>  It is easy to see that the lag in the first two tests is significant.  But this is exactly for comparison, after all, the models of the Y line are initially focused on games.  In addition, the gap can be greatly reduced by choosing the Z70-80 in a configuration with a quad-core i7 processor and video memory capacity increased to 4 GB.  But in performance tests when solving common problems, the differences are almost insignificant. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/182/420/3d5/1824203d5aba4bdcbef0919ea08bbbe6.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/78d/fee/78a/78dfee78a06a45a6a9fccb149555725d.jpg"><br><br>  For RAM, the notebook has two slots.  In the described configuration, they have two DDR3L strips with a frequency of 1600 MHz, 4 GB each, i.e.  only 8 GB.  If you suddenly want to increase this volume, then you will need to remove the plastic protective panel from the bottom of the laptop.  This process takes a maximum of a minute: unscrew the two screws, and you're done.  The maximum supported RAM is 16 GB.  That is exactly what is installed in the top configurations of the Z70-80. <br><br>  The drive bay is also in the direct access area: if you want to change the 2.5-inch hybrid HDD to SSD, then there will be no problems.  But this is all, of course, at your own peril and risk, remember the warranty.  Well, the hybrid disk also has its advantages: even if the speed of writing and copying files, application work is not in priority, fast system loading is always nice. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bad/901/d7b/bad901d7b3d648eba59222c8c9b823e5.JPG"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Autonomy</font> </h2><br>  It remains only to tell about autonomy, but this item of the program for 17-inch "home" laptops is traditionally not the most important.  However, its honest 4 hours in typewriter mode or web surfing battery withstands without problems.  But in games, when installing on the results is higher than in 1-1.5 hours you should not hope.  Miracles do not happen - the display and discrete graphics consume a lot of energy, despite the fact that the processor can be called economical. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Instead of conclusion</font> </h2><br>  We conclude with a small confession: we really liked the Lenovo Z70-80 at the Moscow office.  And, more importantly, even with the current dollar rate (already around 50, but not yet 33, like the good old ones), the price for configurations similar to those tested turned out to be interesting in Russia: it starts at forty-fifty thousand rubles.  And the choice is simple.  Of course, models with an Intel Core i7 processor are more interesting, but if you don‚Äôt take a great interest in games, you can only consider them in the context of perspective.  A more powerful computer will want to be replaced later, but this is no secret to anyone. <br><br>  Our previous posts: <br><br>  <b><font color="#d8291e">¬ª</font></b> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/246788/">Lenovo S90: S - means selfie</a> <br>  <b><font color="#d8291e">¬ª</font></b> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/245396/">Lenovo Yoga 3 Pro Transformer Ultrabook: Intel Core M in Good Environment</a> <br>  <b><font color="#d8291e">"</font></b> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/244522/">10" chips "Lenovo Vibe UI 2.0 and a little insider</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365573/">https://habr.com/ru/post/365573/</a></p>
