Recently we launched a <a href="http://lessons.umi-cms.ru/">large educational special project about sales and marketing</a> for studios and agencies.  Within its framework, I prepared a text about the preparation of a commercial proposal on a military example - and wanted to share it with the audience Habr. <br><br>  We write a lot of different theoretical materials, and they often ask me, " <i>Andrew, theory is good, but show</i> me <i>how a particular sentence should look like which you think is good?</i> ".  This text is my detailed, almost 20 pages, answer to this question. <br><br>  I chose a case as close as possible to reality - and in the form of a semi-artistic narration I led my lyric hero Bublikoff through all the stages of preparing a command post and participating in a tender.  Let's start: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

      <br>
      <strong>So, in the framework of the case, we represent the fictional company Studio Bublikova</strong> , we work in Moscow, were founded in 2008, we have 17 people in our staff, we specialize in production services, we work on UMI, for a couple of long-time clients we have a context and some SMM, we work at an average rate of 1700 rubles per hour, we have good support (with aligned processes and allocated resources).  We are in some ratings of web studios in the middle of the list, a couple of times a year we give reports at medium-sized conferences, positioning ourselves as a good second-tier production with strong support.  Our clients are services, ecommerce, several mining companies, a couple of real estate agencies.  We mainly make corporate websites, shops, and sometimes promotional websites.  Complex large services and portals are not particularly able. <br><br>  I am the very Bublik, whose name is named our studio. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  Introductory </h3><br><ul><li>  I highly recommend reading our two materials on the theoretical part of the organization of participation in the tender for the development of the site: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/112549/">habrahabr.ru/post/112549/</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/112550/">habrahabr.ru/post/112550/</a> .  They were published a few years ago, but have remained quite relevant to date. <br><br></li><li>  Design and decoration.  This is a completely individual thing for each studio / agency, so in this material we do not focus on the appearance of documents and content, but give the information itself: squeeze in fact, not form. <br><br></li><li>  Of course, I do not pretend to create the only true version of the KP, there is no silver bullet.  The document and process can be broken down in hundreds of different ways, use a different style, approaches, change the composition, presentation, etc. But I am sure that the material presented below will be useful and practically applicable to 90% of the players in our agency market. </li></ul><br><h3>  Customer request, first contact and briefing </h3><br>  Sunny autumn morning, on Monday, I come to my office with funny pictures on the walls, pour coffee, open a laptop, start to look at the mail.  In the mailbox there are a couple of letters from current customers, one from a partner with cats, a link to the models for the current project from a freelancer.  Layouts nothing like that, I write a couple of comments in the basecamp and shake a list of letters further.  About - here it is, the request for the development of a new site from a potential client.  They drove. <br><br>  I open the letter and see the following text there: <br><br><blockquote>  Good day. <br><br>  I represent Accounting Without Care, and we invite you to take part in a tender to develop our new corporate website instead of the current <a href="http://www.buh-buh-buh.ru/">www.buh-buh-buh.ru</a> . <br><br>  The site should be implemented on one of the popular commercial CMS, contain information about our main services, online order forms, look good on mobile devices.  We have already prepared most of the texts and information for the new site.  We also need integration of applications from the site with our internal CRM system. <br><br>  We would like to receive from you a commercial proposal for the development of such a project, to understand the timing and possible budget for implementation. <br><br>  Sincerely, Mikhail Sergeev, <br>  Head of Marketing Communications <br>  ‚ÄúAccounting without worries‚Äù <br><br>  sergeev@buh-buh-buh.ru </blockquote><br>  It seems everything is clear.  I go to the current site.  The company is engaged in remote accounting services, personnel records management, focuses on small business and entrepreneurs who can not or do not want to hire a dear person in the state.  According to the information on the site, a rather large company, in the state of 90 people, was founded in 1992 and is in the top 5 in this market. <br><br>  The site was made in 2009 by a third-tier studio.  Then looked at 4-, now at 3-.  Several text sections on areas of services, online order form, section about the company, contacts.  On the iPhone, everything is leaving, on a high resolution it looks too shallow. <br><br>  Okay.  Need to communicate.  Let's start with a call, <strong>but before that let's google the guide</strong> : <br><br><ul><li>  The founder and director, 52 years old, was not found in social networks, several interviews in the ‚ÄúChief Accountant‚Äù, one interview in ‚ÄúThe Secret of the Firm‚Äù, talks about the market, about personnel, about western experience, about social responsibility of business. <br><br></li><li>  Our counterpart Mikhail Sergeev.  42 years, found a profile in Linkedin, in the company for 6 years, before that he was in charge of PR in a medium-sized law firm, higher economic education, Russian MBA.  The interview was not found, but there were a couple of quotes that he did not see the threat from developing SaaS services for accounting, that different CA, needs, market, etc. Okay, at least knows what SaaS is, not bad. </li></ul><br>  <strong>Call customer.</strong>  Mikhail himself answers the phone, as part of a meek five-minute conversation, we find out that yes, the task is relevant, the new site must be published within three and a half months.  When asked about the budget plug, Mikhail responds vaguely that he generally understands the price range in the market, that he knows that we have a fairly high level of work.  When asked about the number and composition of bidders, he says that these are 4 companies, he does not specify the name.  In a conversation, Mikhail manages to tell you that they have big plans for the Internet, that they are actively growing, he says confidently, he does not abuse terminology, he doesn‚Äôt dive deep into detail. <br>  We do not insist on exact answers, we offer to meet in their office for acquaintance, questions to the customer and discuss details.  After a second hitch Michael agrees, and set the date and time of the briefing. <br><br>  Then we go to the briefing and hold the first meeting with Michael.  I will not separately dwell on the process itself, we will go straight to the results obtained after the meeting. <br><br>  <strong>According to the results of the briefing, we find out:</strong> <br><br><ol><li>  <strong>Tasks of the customer, the current situation.</strong>  Michael considers the current site obsolete, but at the same time more than 30% of all orders come through it.  He understands that the site should be redone and increase conversion.  The main task is a leadgen.  The second in importance is image support, branding.  Social networks - he is not sure. <br><br></li><li>  <strong>Functional.</strong>  With the functionality, everything is clear, UMI as a customer platform suits, the only time about integration with CRM.  We ask what and how to integrate.  Apparently, we came first from the competitors to the meeting, because Michael does not answer the question very confidently.  It turns out that CRM is still being implemented, and it is not very clear what is there and how.  To the direct question - whether to include work in the budget, Mikhail says that for now, probably not, but the platform should be ready for the subsequent development of this functionality.  Okay, that was important.  Competitors may not ask this question - and re-pledge the budget and deadlines. <br><br></li><li>  <strong>An agency that drives context and SEO.</strong>  With the current site developer, Michael almost does not communicate.  But he is actively working with the agency ‚ÄúMayContext‚Äù, which conducts SEO and contextual advertising, the level of budgets is about 150 thousand per month.  Good guys, says Mikhail, we have been working with them for 6 years. <br><br>  6 years.  Something was about 6 years just recently ... Right at the meeting, I open the website "MayContext" on the tablet.  They specialize in context and SEO, there‚Äôs nothing about production.  I open my portfolio.  So, building, brokers, nedvizhka, windows ... So ... Lawyers.  Hmm ... I've seen these lawyers somewhere.  In the next tab I open the pre-loaded Michael profile on linkedin.  Exactly, this is where I saw these lawyers - this is his previous place of work.  And just 6 years old, as he has been working in Accounting Without Cares.  <strong>Alarm-alarm-alarm!</strong>  It seems that it was he who dragged the agency to a new client almost immediately after switching to another job.  He has been working with them for a long time in close good relations.  Phew, it's good that they have no production, otherwise our chances would be quite slim.  We ask Michael if these guys are aware that the site will be remade.  Yes, in the know - and after the launch, he is ready to increase their budget.  So let's write, this is one of the most important facts that we learned at the meeting. <br><br></li><li>  <strong>The agency that made the current site.</strong>  Mikhail is reluctant to talk about them, support problems, the site is outdated, they haven‚Äôt even been called in to a new tender.  We ask if they are aware of the tender.  Yes, in the know.  Okay. <br><br></li><li>  <strong>The composition of the bidders.</strong>  In contrast to a telephone conversation at a meeting, I manage to pull out the list of participants, arguing that this is a common transparent practice for our market and serious customers (at the same time he flung light flattery). <br><br><ul><li>  "Major Digital".  First echelon, top agency, serious guys.  Much more and more expensive than us, FDS, all things.  But one can‚Äôt say that production would be a lot stronger than us, and they give a lot to subcontracting. </li><li>  The guys from the "Traffic Graph".  We know them well.  About our level, but they focus not only on production, but also on context - one of their flagship services.  But support is clearly weaker than ours. </li><li>  "Homa Studio".  A small Moscow studio of 6 people, the third echelon, the average price tag of 100-150 thousand per site.  It's not clear how they worked here, but oh well. </li></ul><br></li></ol><br><h3>  Competitive intelligence and preliminary training </h3><br>  So, we clarified the tasks of the customer, learned more about his business, found out the composition of competitors and what other agencies we can intersect in further work on the client account. <br><br>  Now we need to carry out a number of preparatory works - before we begin the formation of the main commercial proposal for the development of the site. <br><br>  Make a number of calls <br><br><ul><li>  <strong>The agency that made the current site.</strong>  As long as we know quite general things, we need to clarify how adequate the client is.  The first 5 minutes of the agency director do not really understand what I want from him.  Then he reluctantly says that he is generally a normal client, but they expected to take them to the context and SEO, and there the other guys are already very tight.  Great, the client seems to be nothing, but our hypothesis about the ‚Äúhome agency‚Äù only confirms this. <br><br></li><li>  <strong>The context-driven agency and SEO is MayContext.</strong>  Wake-acquaintance.  If you can not cut them - you need to make friends.  I say that we are participating in the tender, that I understand that I will have to work with them on promotion, and that I have heard good reviews from my friends.  I say that we specialize only in production and support 0151 to reduce the level of potential threat.  I ask if they are aware that in the tender with us Traffic Graph, and Major Digital (I don‚Äôt ask about Khomu, we will eat them ourselves).  They know about the ‚ÄúMajor‚Äù, and the ‚ÄúTraffic-Graph‚Äù - a surprise, and quite unpleasant, given their competence in context - they definitely won't want to let them into their field.  Well, with one call I got an advantage in the fight against the most difficult equal competitor.  A couple of times I declare assurances of eternal friendship and hope for cooperation - and say goodbye. <br><br></li><li>  <strong>The most relevant case from current customers.</strong>  We also have lawyers in the portfolio, whom Mikhail should know from the previous place of work - but they were larger, therefore they hardly competed.  I call the manager who gave us feedback and ask for permission to give an electronic quote on his behalf that ‚ÄúWe recommend Accounting Without Cares to cooperate on developing a website with Studio Bublikov as a reliable and competent partner‚Äù.  A trifle, but such personalization is very important. <br><br></li><li>  <strong>We write on FB to three familiar startups.</strong>  This is our client's ca.  Of course, it doesn‚Äôt pull into research, but I ask 2-3 questions about their opinion from the point of view of remote accounting services.  Two answer something tolerable, one silent.  All right, we will insert citations in KP. </li></ul><br>  We are thinking about a competitive strategy for this tender. <br><br><ul><li>  <strong>‚ÄúHoma Studio‚Äù</strong> is a template discounter.  KP they will make a typical, put up a low price.  In this regard, we are not doing anything, but when we live through the budget with the client, we make a remark about the profitability of the agency business, the ‚Äúoverhead‚Äù ratio, and that if they put them on a corporate website for 100-150 thousand, then they will work on it low skilled people.  Or spend much less work hours than you need to implement a quality project. <br><br></li><li>  <strong>"Traffic Graph".</strong>  The most difficult thing is, but we will try to remove them with the help of ‚ÄúMayContext‚Äù + we will try to work out KP at the level of licking and fine detail better. <br><br></li><li>  <strong>"Major Digital".</strong>  Full Digital Service.  Expose the price tag and a half or two more than us.  The client is not too important for them, they will send ordinary managers with a standard presentation.  Will sell the company, not the project.  Here we need to convince Michael that our production level is not worse, and we will make the focus on the client much higher than the Major (and any large agency).  In face-to-face communication, it will be necessary to screw very carefully that we have experience working on a subcontract with other large FDS agencies.  By this, we will, firstly, show that the final quality of our work is the same as that of the tops, and secondly, we will cast into his mind the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe prevalence of subcontracting for such agencies (and therefore, an extra overpayment). </li></ul><br>  We conduct brainstorming with the project team <br><br>  I will call my partner, a couple of managers and an art director into the negotiations.  The project is quite simple, the industry is competitive, you need to cling to something.  We write on the blackboard a cloud of "synonyms" associated with the customer's business and industry.  We are trying to think about the ‚Äúaccounting agency of the future‚Äù in 50 years.  We print models of the main pages and landings on 10 competitors.  Spend an hour of time, ideas - by zeros.  Artdir proposes making the main one in the form of a parallax of an advertising leaflet drawn in the style of Mayakovsky‚Äôs poems.  We take away the grass from him, we think further - we need clues. <br><br>  After an hour and a half, it‚Äôs still zeros.  Sucks.  Okay, you do not know what to offer - talk about the crisis.  We come up with a special section of the site for companies that, in a crisis, are considering the possibility of reducing the accountant (which is unlikely) and HR (which is closer).  Let's make a landing with the text "10 facts you need to know when reducing your HR".  A little tin, of course, but bezrybe ... <br><br>  While we are discussing this, we come up with another mini-call with infographics, which will reflect all three types of accounting approach - SaaS on our own, outsourcing and staff.  Norms, no matter how they talk about SaaS, it must be dangerous for them, and it is necessary to properly position the advantages and the customer‚Äôs TSS. <br><br>  Not much, but it should be enough, since nothing else was thought up.  Now, finally, you can proceed to the formation of the commercial offer itself. <br><br><h3>  KP formation </h3><br>  We proceed to the formation of the commercial offer itself.  And, of course, we take into account all the information that we collected in the previous stages. <br><br><h4>  0. General moments </h4><br><ul><li>  <strong>General style and presentation.</strong>  As we found out at the preparatory stages, Mikhail and his leadership are more likely to have a global temperament, they are prone to strategic things, and not immersed in details.  The ‚Äútech economist‚Äù axis is clearly economists.  In this regard, it is necessary to correct the general style of information presentation and try to mention less technical technical things that I, Bublikov, really like. <br><br></li><li>  <strong>Saw mentions about the context.</strong>  Since there is a possibility that our KP will be sent to MaiContext for evaluation, we cut out all references to our competencies in contextual advertising - in order not to irritate them once again. <br><br></li><li>  <strong>We focus on support.</strong>  Since this is our strength, and the previous contractor has merged precisely on support - we try to mention more often how well we are with this. <br><br></li></ul><br>  We now turn to the eight main sections of our KP.  We will give in this material only actual pressing, without mentioning all sorts of binding paragraphs, marketing water and other gluing - this is individual for each company. <br><br><h4>  1. Brief description of project goals and objectives </h4><br>  At the very beginning, we need to convince the customer that we will solve exactly the task that stands before him - briefly and succinctly.  Insert the following paragraph: <br><br><blockquote>  The key goal of the project is to create an effective channel for attracting new clients for Accounting Without Care in two key areas of services - remote accounting services and personnel records management. <br><br>  The following main points of effort in the creation of a new site can be highlighted: <br><br><ol><li>  Development of a resource showing high conversion to new requests for company services in all groups of Central Asia and all types of services provided. <br><br></li><li>  Creating a presentation platform containing comprehensive information about the company, its benefits, services and mission. </li><li>  Development of an effective emotional image of the company through the use of a creative project concept focused on key groups of Central Asia.  Support and increase brand awareness of the company in the Internet. <br><br></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> In the future - reducing internal costs due to the integration with the CRM-system and the automation of related business processes. </font></font></li></ol></blockquote><br><h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 2. Central Asia and competitive environment, core expertise </font></font></h4><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the previous paragraph, we convinced the client that we would do what he needed. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now we need to show that we can do this not in isolation from reality - but with due consideration for the understanding of the specifics of his business and competitive environment. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We insert a small sign on its main competitors, the list of which we prepared for brainstorming:</font></font><br><br><blockquote>               ¬´  ¬ª.

Description of the production process of the project (in stages) and interaction with the client, the risks </font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Now that we have described what we plan to do in the project, we must explain to the customer exactly how we will do it, what will be required of it and what risks exist: </font></font><br><br><blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> The main stages of the project and customer participation: </font></font><br><table><tbody><tr><th>  Stage </th><th><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Studio Bublikova </font></font></th><th><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ‚ÄúAccounting without worries‚Äù </font></font></th></tr><tr><td><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Development of technical specifications </font></font></td><td>  x </td><td><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> List of edits, acceptance of the document within 2 days </font></font></td></tr><tr><td><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Designing page layouts </font></font></td><td>  x </td><td><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Revision list, acceptance within 2 days </font></font></td></tr><tr><td><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Visual concept development </font></font></td><td>  x </td><td><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Meeting presentation, revision list for 2 days </font></font></td></tr><tr><td>  Design </td><td>  x </td><td><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Prompt acceptance of developed layouts </font></font></td></tr><tr><td><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Functional assembly </font></font></td><td>  x </td><td><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Perhaps - providing information about the API of the CRM system </font></font></td></tr><tr><td><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Processing and content filling </font></font></td><td>  x </td><td><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Discussion on the missing content, operational improvements </font></font></td></tr><tr><td><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Testing and implementation </font></font></td><td>  x </td><td><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Final testing of the project before launch, a list of corrections within 2 days. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Domain and Hosting Access</font></font></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Since the project is simple, very briefly indicate the possible risks: </font></font><br><br><blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We do not see critical risks in the process of project implementation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The important points include:</font></font><br><br><ul><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Providing all available content on the customer‚Äôs side prior to the start of the project. </font></font><br><br></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Prompt acceptance of intermediate results of work and the signing of relevant acts. </font></font><br><br></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Macro-factor, possible edits to the Tax Code of the Russian Federation in the process of developing the site, with a subsequent change in the composition of the services of the Customer. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the event of an offensive, it will require a delay of 10 working days and an additional budget of 90,000 rubles.</font></font></li></ul></blockquote><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Shifts of terms in the case of delays on the customer side are prescribed at the level of X * 2 days, but not in KP, but in the application for the development of the site. </font></font><br><br><h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 5. Squeezing ideas (with reference to the presentation) </font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Everything is quite simple here - we briefly describe our ideas developed within the framework of the brainstorm (crisis page, infographics on different three approaches), we give a reference to an extended presentation, where they are described in more detail. </font></font><br><br><h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 6. Estimate + plan (Gantt chart) of project implementation </font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The main sections, structure, process and ideas are described - you can move on to the estimate and work plan. Best of all, this estimate will show, combined with the Gantt chart. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This section should be placed on one sheet, and it should be ‚Äúautonomous‚Äù - contain all the necessary information in case the entire page is printed out and put on the table for the director: </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ef0/d21/a3f/ef0d21a3fbfb26bdbd0bf23f7c043eea.jpg" alt="2"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Let's pay special attention to the fact that we added the creation and implementation of landing pages in total estimate of works - with the launch already on the 5th week. First, it will give us room for maneuver in case of a demand to lower the budget. Secondly, it will be credited to us as a plus by MaiContext, which can start attracting new traffic already on the 5th week, and not after the completion of the entire project.</font></font><br><br><h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 7. Description of further cooperation, project support format and possible points of interaction </font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The bets are made, now you need to tell the customer what will happen after the publication of the site in public and the signing of acts. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Especially considering his problems in this area with a previous contractor:</font></font><br><br><blockquote>    <strong>     </strong>     ¬´¬ª.           ,       (  ,    ),      . <br><br>           ,      .         ,     ,           . <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Department of Support and Development is a dedicated structural subdivision of Studio Bublikov with a staff of 6 people. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We work on SLA (basic response time to treatment is 30 minutes). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the moment, there are 18 sites in the service department, which generate more than 12,000 calls from new customers to our customers. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The cost of the basic service package after the first month will be 40,000 rubles per month, the volume of the included work hours is 30.</font></font></blockquote><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">+ a short list of services included in the basic subscription. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of course, if we make a call with a free month of service, it was necessary to smudge it before it according to estimates - in order not to work for free. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As you can see, they threw another hook about working together in the direction of MayContext.</font></font><br><br><h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 8. Conclusion </font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In this block, we must sum up a certain result on our proposal, assure the customer of success and give some positive emotional message. Notice, before that, we did not operate on current conversion rates, which we learned at the briefing, and did not give any predictions as to how we can increase it. Let's do it now with the last convincing argument:</font></font><br><br><blockquote> ¬´ ¬ª    ,           ¬´  ¬ª. <br><br> <strong>  (     )        1%  1,5%.</strong> <br><br>                       ,       1,75%. <br><br>           ¬´  ¬ª     ,         . <br></blockquote><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is important - we are talking about cooperation in the development of the site as an already accomplished thing. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is important - we immediately increase the value of the transition to our support not only in terms of ‚Äúsupport‚Äù, but also an increase in targeted KPIs. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is important - we make a reservation about ‚Äúpreserving the current quality of traffic‚Äù - otherwise we can get pretty.</font></font><br><br><h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> We pass the checklist and make adjustments </font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">KP is ready. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I look at the clock, 21-00. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can, in principle, send it to the client now. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But, first, it is better to present in person. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Secondly, it is necessary to look still once again on a fresh head. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Going home, returning to the proposal in the morning. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">First, we will go through a typical checklist, which has long been implemented for both himself and sales managers. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Look at the points.</font></font><br><br><ol><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Have you formulated the goals and objectives of the project? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Have the expected result been described?</font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Have you described the structure and scope of project work?

</li><li>         /? </li></ol><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Everything seems to be ok, nothing is forgotten - except for a couple of moments. </font></font><br><br> <strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Knowledge of customer terminology and industry. </font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Here it would be possible to make the accents more feasible - we have shown knowledge of the industry, but with terms it can be better. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Google </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Add the phrase:</font></font><br><br><blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Considering the initiative of the State Duma of the Russian Federation on the possible introduction of an additional tax on real estate for companies operating in the simplified taxation system, we recommend developing an additional section on the website, which would contain complete and up-to-date information about future changes in the Tax Code of the Russian Federation - both for current and for potential customers of the company. </font></font><br></blockquote><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It, by the way, pulls on full-fledged idea. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well, that googled. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We do not insert it into the presentation and the manual, it will be a separate trump card in the sleeve for an in-person presentation. </font></font><br><br> <strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It turned out somehow dry. </font></font></strong> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The overall impression is a bit dry. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well, there is a long-standing reception - we take pictures, mine and a partner, and insert their document with a couple of quotes of direct speech:</font></font><br><br><blockquote><ol><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Andrei Bublikov: ‚ÄúStudio Bublikova perfectly understands the specifics of the market for remote accounting services and personnel administration. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In our work, we use both full-time specialists and SaaS solutions to automate relevant business processes. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, we know exactly how to competently show the advantages of ‚ÄúAccounting without worries‚Äù in this competitive market. ‚Äù</font></font><br><br></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Vasily Adzhaylov: ‚ÄúThe situation in terms of tax legislation, as well as the accounting services market itself, is changing very quickly in Russia. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">One of the main strengths of our Studio is the perfectly structured development and support processes for projects. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, we guarantee the regular development of possible improvements, changes and adjustments on the project - promptly and without reminders from the customer - as part of the basic subscription service package. ‚Äù</font></font></li></ol></blockquote><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now, along with the quotes of those startups we interviewed during the preparatory stage, and the quote recommendation of our customer from the law firm is already quite normal. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Everything, the document is ready, we exhale.</font></font><br><br><h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Other documents in the shared pool </font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the meeting, the presentation of the proposal we will go not only with KP. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We will need some more documents that may come in handy.</font></font><br><br><ol><li> <strong> .</strong>     ,   .

Important news - the CEO plans to drop in at the meeting. We recall the information that we could dig up on it. Apparently, he has a global economic mindset, like Michael. To me, a techie by nature, it‚Äôs going to be difficult for the two of them - I take to meet my partner who just likes to talk about the market, trends and other visionary skills. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Since the director actively talks about the western market in his interviews, before the meeting we quickly make a couple of dozen screenshots of the websites of large western companies of the necessary industry sector - we will show our knowledge of the market and talk in the like / dislike mode.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We carefully print all documents on a color printer and good paper; we take electronic copies for the projector - it is always better to combine electronic and solid media. We are going, going. </font></font><br><br> <strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Accents on the presentation of the</font></font></strong> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> surprise number of times. Director at the meeting will not, flew on a business trip. The presentation on Western sites is not useful, I do not even get it out of the bag. Well, it happens.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Surprise number two. At the meeting, two young girls from the department of Michael. One is a marketer, the second is a PR manager. Not too good at first glance. But let's see what and how they will talk. Yes, it is, in the very first few sentences said: ‚ÄúEngegment, gamification, instagram, brand platform‚Äù. Fak, ponabrali students on production. This is not good - the vigorous guys from the major cycle agency Major Digital will surely make a greater impression on them than I did with my dismal tech-nary approach and production. But it‚Äôs not for nothing that I took Vasily to a meeting - he quickly recalls a couple of some irrelevant commercials from Cannes, then tells a couple of tales from his experience working with large advertisers, gives several quotes from "99 francs" and "Mad Men" - and that's it, they are ours.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We start to go through the essence of the proposal. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Carefully talk about the ideas. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The idea about the crisis seems to be like Mikhail, the infographic references are girls.</font></font> Good.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But it is not enough for them, they, apparently, expect creativity. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They say that I would like more. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Okay, we get an idea from the sleeve about fast problems in the market with the simplified taxation system - and a separate section about it - and by profile, and it seems to be normal. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And they pretended to come up right at the meeting. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Great, the questions are removed. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We reach the estimates and work plan. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We go through the stages and overlaps of works on the Gantt chart in detail. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is a question about a separate line with the development of a landing page - we explain that this is a good way to test the concept, start introducing changes early, etc. It seems to be accepted.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Next is the standard question from Michael. As a new major customer, surprise surprise, they want a discount. Then I make a speech for 5 minutes about the very ‚Äúoverhead‚Äù ratio, the profit rate of 15-20% in the agency market, quickly spread out by expenditure and labor costs (who can understand this, if not an accounting firm), and at the same time tell the case about the fact that the site can not cost 100 thousand - a stone in the garden "Homa Studio". Everything is clear, but they still want a discount.</font></font> It happens. <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">All right, we say, you can delete a landing page from the work pool, and also eliminate one or two additional ideas voiced - this will reduce the cost of interest by 15. But they already liked the ideas. With the landing, they realized that it was possible to exclude an option - they received their space for maneuver (perhaps for the CEO), the question is closed. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Separately, we mention that one of our strengths is support and development, remembering that it was in this that the previous contractor broke through. We say the final words, smile, shake hands, find out that they are planning to make a decision within a week, we are going back to the office. </font></font><br><br> <strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Waiting for results</font></font></strong> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The next day after the meeting we will send a letter to Michael with answers to a couple of questions that surfaced at the meeting - we are not turned off from work. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We ask how are you - everything seems to be ok. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It takes 8 days, no information yet. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Anxious.</font></font><br><br><ul><li> <strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Make a call to Michael. </font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We ask how things are going and when we can expect results. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He says everything is fine, is about to begin. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We try to do his work for him - and ask if we need help, for example, in preparing some kind of certificate for his leadership, pressing, something else. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It does not roll - but it was worth trying, it often works.</font></font><br><br></li><li> <strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Make a call to the agency "MaiContext." </font></font></strong><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We ask how things are going, we remind you that there should be just about the results of the tender. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They know.</font></font> Fine.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We are entering with a trump card - we say that we included in the design work the development of the landing page at an early stage, which will have to be tested on the context, which means that they will be able to get an increased budget not after launching the site, but earlier. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They say a good idea (well, still). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Everything, on them fulfilled everything that they could.</font></font> We wait. </li></ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> As a result, after two more days of waiting, we receive a letter: </font></font><br><br><blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Andrei, good afternoon. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We have chosen you as a contractor to create our new site. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Send the contract, applications and invoice for payment of the first stage of work. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I propose to hold a trilateral meeting on Tuesday with the agency MaiContext to discuss plans, project and cooperation. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sincerely, Mikhail Sergeev, </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Head of Marketing Communications Department </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúAccounting Without Concerns‚Äù </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">sergeev@buh-buh-buh.ru</font></font><br><br></blockquote><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Hooray, we are great, we won invented competitors in a virtual tender =) </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, it is possible that with ‚ÄúMayContext‚Äù we will spend more time on this client account - although so far nothing portends.</font></font><br><br><h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Afterparty </font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We won the tender, but it is important now not to relax - and correctly enter the work on the project. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Practice shows that up to 30% of ‚Äúwon‚Äù tenders never reach the start of work - due to problems with documents, jambs in the early stages and other trifles. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Remember that keeping the current client is easier than getting a new one. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Be sure to conduct a debriefing with the team that participated in the tender: praise for the victory, tell you what the customer liked and what was past. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Everything, now it is necessary to begin work. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After all, all this was, in fact, only preparation.</font></font><br><br><h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Some comments </font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of course, this is just a fictional case, albeit as close as possible to combat conditions. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is clear that within the framework of the artistic genre of the narrative, my lyric hero, Bublikova, ideas, clues, and all sorts of coincidences fell like a cornucopia. And the concentration of various kinds of receptions and visits goes off scale, usually less. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On the other hand, if Bublikov had not done his homework in preparing for the tender, was not attentive to details and did not connect the brain, he could easily have passed all these clues - and eventually lost the tender. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We will be happy to discuss your thoughts and questions in the comments =) And we also recall that we have prepared a lot of other good free content about marketing and sales issues in our free " </font></font><a href="http://lessons.umi-cms.ru/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Digital-series"</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"- join! </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">* After the division of Habr, a number of hubs about business and management / marketing studios were nailed, so we write in two of the most relevant remaining -" web development "and" project management.
