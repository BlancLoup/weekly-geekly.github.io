This equipment will help to easily remove all data from any Apple devices, as well as smartphones and tablets running the Android platform.  The complex will also help the Sverdlovsk security officials to find out literally everything - points of movement, calls made and received, correspondence in social networks and instant messengers, photo and video materials.  <b>At the same time, even deleted data and data from such secure repositories as iCloud, Dropbox and Android backups can be cracked and retrieved, reports the newspaper Izvestia.</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the near future, the office of Mikhail Borodin will purchase an analytical complex with licenses for ten software products worth almost 2 million rubles.  It will include devices for data recovery from flash drives, hard drives of computers running OS X, iOS, Windows, Android.  According to the technical regulations, the data extraction module will allow you to read information via a wired connection from any device.  And for the program it will not matter whether the device is blocked or not.  Such a complex is necessary for the police to solve crimes and collect the necessary evidence.

      ‚ÄúThis technique is necessary for use in forensic laboratories,‚Äù the federal media told reporters at the press center of the Main Directorate of the MOI of Russia for the Sverdlovsk Region.  - In the case of using Apple products for criminal purposes, this complex will allow an object to be examined for the presence of data relevant to the case. <br><br>  According to technical documentation, the complex should be able to open blocked devices, including those protected by a fingerprint scanner, which are used in smartphones and tablets by Apple and other manufacturers.  The complex will be able to receive complete information that is stored or previously located in a computer or mobile device: contacts, photos, calls, information from the organizer about meetings, reminders, and read all messages.  The system will have to be able to analyze photo and video materials, including skin tones, and also stitch them into a single clip.  ‚ÄúThe presence of a built-in interpreter of GPS coordinates, systems for detecting images containing skin tones, and analyzing key frames of proprietary video images,‚Äù the document contains technical requirements.  <b>In addition, using the complex, police will be able to see a list of visited addresses on the Internet, receive passwords from identifiers from the iCloud cloud storage (in the case of Apple), or accounts from an Android device.</b>  <b>In addition, data from more than 400 applications such as Apple Maps, Facebook, Google+, PayPal, Viber, WhatsApp, etc. can be accessed</b> .  Thus, theoretically, investigators and investigators will be able to track the financial operations of a criminal, his correspondence or his location in the required period of time. <br><br>  ‚ÄúComplexes are mobile and stationary,‚Äù Nikolai Golubev, the official representative of the Oxygen Software company, said.  - In the first case, the complex has the form of a case with a display and a set of wires: this allows the employee to get all the data on the phone right at the scene of the crime or search.  In a stationary version, the software is simply installed on a computer in a crime lab. <br><br>  At the same time, according to the expert, the extraction of remote and hidden content from the memory of the phone and computer is only one of the aspects of the operation of such a system. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIn investigating crimes, the chronology of the actions and movements of the owner is usually much more interesting,‚Äù Golubev notes to Izvestia.  - It can be traced through the restoration of photos, geo-coordinates and Wi-Fi points to which the device was connected.  A technician is many, there are many data sources, and such programs allow collecting all this data in one place. <br><br>  According to investigators, the criminals are well aware that most of the crimes are now revealed precisely because of the analysis of data on the activity of mobile phones, so they are trying to protect themselves. <br><br>  - Some people try to secure an alibi before the crime - they leave the mobile phone to relatives or their friends to use it.  We call it ‚Äúwalking the phone,‚Äù one of the TFR investigators told reporters.  - Therefore, data on the activity of a mobile phone are always subject to verification and only after that they can become evidence in court. </blockquote><br><br>  The office that is mentioned in the article <a href="http://www.oxygen-forensic.com/ru/">really exists</a> . <br>  I wonder, are similar analytical complexes being developed in conjunction with smartphone manufacturers? <br>  Or just Sverdlovsk Interior Ministry dissolved) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/364021/">https://habr.com/ru/post/364021/</a></p>
