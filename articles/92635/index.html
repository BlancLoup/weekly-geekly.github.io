Unlimited 3G from Ukrtelecom</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h3>  Hidden threat </h3><br>  For Utel, April was marked by two events: a rebranding, due to which the Utel brand ceased to exist, and the service names were renamed to the corresponding services of Ukrtelecom, and the introduction of unlimited <a href="http://www.ukrtelecom.ua/services/customers/mobile/tariff/internet">data plans</a> on 3G wireless Internet. <br>  If the first event left me almost indifferent, then the second made me have double feelings - on the one hand, the new tariffs seemed very appetizing, on the other hand they doubted whether the Ukrtelecom networks would withstand the influx of subscribers and the increased traffic?  As it turned out, the suspicions were very reasonable.  But by that time I was already Utel's contract subscriber, so I had nothing to lose ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  Ukrtelecom delivers a sudden strike </h3><br>  The problems began even before the official entry of "unlimited", in the last days of March.  In the evening, the speed dropped to 100 kbps and less, pings became simply monstrous, packet loss exceeded 30%.  In the community Utela in LJ fell complaints of subscribers.  The answer to the calls to the support was one - ‚Äúsorry for temporary inconveniences, the specialists of Ukrtelecom are working to improve the quality of services‚Äù. <br>  It should be noted that shortly before these events in Donetsk, the average speed was 1.5 Mbit / s, occasionally reaching 2 Mbit / s.  In early April, the results of speed measurements showed the following: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/25/ca/25cae42313934beb952a2961e58028a2.png" alt="image">

There was a suspicion that the channel "cut" intentionally.  However, a week later the 0.5 Mbit / c plan was taken, but in the evenings everything was just as sad as before. <br><br><h3>  New Hope </h3><br><br>  On April 27, the thing that subscribers least expected happened - Ukrtelecom made an official <a href="http://www.ukrtelecom.ua/presscenter/news/official%3Fid%3D99987">statement</a> in which it acknowledged the problem and promised to eliminate it as soon as possible: <br><blockquote>  Shanovn—ñ koristuvach—ñ poslugi "CSO!  Mobilnyy "! <br><br>  Shiro vdyachn—ñ you for obranny itself Ukrtelekom yak provider access to less Internet. <br><br>  Ukrtelecom earns unprecedented krok for Ukraine, clicked on people across any other country using the mobile Internet for a reasonable price with tariffs that are at the expense of high rates, but without the use of your application, using the same tariffs, at the head of high rates without using your application, using the same tariffs, at the head of high rates without using your application, using the same tariffs, at the head of high rates without using your application, using the same tariffs, at the head of high rates without using your application, using the same tariffs, at the head of high rates without using your application.

Suma rahunka before you put it on yourself, yak vi ocucute that plan. <br><br>  Planuuchi launch of the service ‚ÄúCSO!  Mobilnyy ‚Äùthat forecasters, I spent a great job on expanding mobility for all components.  Prote, yak tilki posluga "CSO!  Mobilnyy ‚Äùbecame available to the deputy, mi zrozum—ñli, scho our forecasts predicted in the actions of the nedoskonalimi.  We didn‚Äôt want to do it, scool the first two years of CSO!  Mobile "will be so active at the end of the traffic, a yak, scho" give "give by wire."  The link is predictive, inaccurate, predicated, elemental less, just like you have for the Internet on the Internet (Gateway GPRS Support Node), has been overhauling from one year ago. <br><br>  Letting go on launching the ‚ÄúCSO!  Mobile ¬ªUnlimited spammers of Ukrtelecom held a great robot with a thermal expansion of a capacity of mobile communication services that could be completed, and until 30, the complex of the robot would be completed, and the program will be satisfied with the program.  Mobny "will be significantly half. <br><br>  Mi in Ukrtelekom—ñ is peaceful and all is able to, so that you can help yourself with the message ‚ÄúCSO!

Thank you for using our services! <br><br>  I, either because of my naivety, or because I had experience with UT (I used ‚ÄúCSO‚Äù for more than 2 years, the impressions were only positive), I believed that from May 1 everything would change for the better.  And in vain. <br><br>  It was April 30, May 1, but things are still there.  Reviews in the community have shown that there is no improvement in different regions of Ukraine, in some places it has become even worse.  However, on the evening of April 30, a positive shift was noted in Kiev, but the regions still suffer from low speed. <br><br>  By my post I do not want to dissuade potential subscribers in any way, but I consider it my duty to inform them of the situation. <br><br>  <b>upd2</b> In the comments, they accuse me that I snicker and do not appreciate what UT does for subscribers: <br><blockquote>  Disconnect nafig, just do not like.  We would be better without you. <br>  I'm sitting on the CSO 20 Mbit!  Ultra and happy, UKRTELECOM Rulit! <br>  because it is the only provider giving a REAL 20 Mbps for 200 UAH ($ 25) in our city, and throughout the country. <br></blockquote><br>  I understand, fed the hungry is not a friend.  But, dear friend, when you leave a comment and a notification arrives in the mail, I spend about 5 minutes on opening the mail, simultaneously updating the page several times, even more to go to this topic and reply.  And it's not over yet.  This was not the case in Ukrtelecomkov Dilap, let alone ADSL.  It turns out that I am ungrateful and do not appreciate? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/92635/">https://habr.com/ru/post/92635/</a></p>
