Victor Milligan, director of marketing for Nexage, analyzed the development of mobile advertising in the past year and spoke about how he sees the near future of this direction. <br><br>  <b>In 2014, the</b> most discussed issues of the industry were: algorithmic purchases (gaining momentum), cookies (with which we seem to be saying goodbye) and branding (investments in which are actively increasing). <br><br>  <b>In 2015, the</b> development of these three areas will continue at an accelerated pace.  We will be able to combine the accumulated media experience with new technological advances, and Mobile will finally cease to be just a convenient marketing term and will turn into a full-fledged strategic channel.

Sites and buyers will more actively use private auctions, such as Direct Deal and Programmatic Guaranteed, and agencies will start purchasing mobile advertising through trading desks. <br>  <b>We will adapt to effective work without cookies.</b> <b><br></b> <br>  The reality of not having cookie tracking scares online marketers, but mobile advertising experts already have experience developing a new data model from scratch.  RTB allows you to integrate internal and third-party data, which gives customers / agencies the ability to create their own cross-channel targeting solutions. <br><br>  <b>Advertising auctions will be the main driving force for premium sites</b> <br><br>  Premium class sites can and will strive to use private auctions for the sale of mobile advertising.  For many, this model is already familiar from working with regular web advertising.  It provides high brand protection and price control, and sites can easily conduct complementary cross-channel digital advertising auctions. <br>  <b>Intelligent advertising strategies as a means of increasing LTV</b> <br><br>  LTV is a key indicator of a healthy business (Life Time Value).  Its importance is emphasized by the fact that about 95% of consumers do not take into account advertising in applications, and large inactive databases also have a negative impact on the results of campaigns.  Focusing on the customer's life cycle will lead to the emergence of smart advertising strategies that ensure brand safety, high quality impressions, reactivation advertising, rich media content and other essential elements of digital marketing for a new era. <br><br>  <b>Closer focus on mobile creativity</b> <br><br>  Many hoped that investments in the development of digital advertising will also be reflected in the mobile channel.  This did not happen, but as noted by all the leading market analysts, a shift is expected in this area.  Investments in mobile will become more focused and effective, so the quality of creative, landing pages and other elements of mobile advertising will increase significantly. <br><br>  <b>Improving attribution methods will open up new opportunities.</b> <br><br>  It is important for brands to understand the value of their mobile campaigns, so much is already being done to arrive at a logical and convenient model for determining the source of traffic. <br>  <b>Cross-channeling will become a necessity;</b>  <b>investments in Mobile - a separate mandatory item of expenditure</b> <br><br>  The client-oriented approach inevitably involves the use of cross-channel strategies.  The question is how these strategies will be applied to different means of communication (TV, online, Mobile, etc.).  General strategic decisions and management methods will be cross-channel, and creative, targeting and campaign implementation methods will depend on the characteristics of the transmission channel. <br><br>  <b>2016: Full speed ahead</b> <br><br>  Next year, the important question will not be ‚Äúwhat?‚Äù (What is algorithmic advertising procurement), but ‚Äúhow?‚Äù (How to bring programmatic to the fore).  This is an important and positive step forward, which promises success for companies and the market as a whole. <br><br> <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/register/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dcontent_marketing"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/041/3c5/29a/0413c529a1424210a02b160e54a40e80.png"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg">BYYD ‚Ä¢ Mobile Advertising Platform</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297382/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297382/</a></p>
