      <b>Father: onboarding</b> <b><br></b> <br>  This is the first and most important story.  Onboarding is the foundation of product growth.  In this story, you will learn what vision we came to, thinking about what is onboarding, why it is needed and what purpose it carries in itself. <br><br>  <b>Son: feedback</b> <br><br>  This is a story about how we came to an interesting way to measure the effectiveness of onboarding, collecting high-quality feedback. <br><br><h3>  Holy Spirit: positioning <br></h3><br>  This is a story about how we made one of the most successful solutions in terms of hacking a conversion, using positioning, communication, and product packaging. <br><br>  <b>Onboarding - why is it needed</b> <br><br>  Many people ask the right question, but what is it really? <br><br>  Maybe this is about the fact that you need to educate the user how to use the product, help him with the development of the product or tell him about the features. <br><br>  And what if the product is really complicated?  For example, in Wrike it is more than hundred features.  Without human intervention to explain about the product is almost impossible.  Maybe onboarding is something else? <br><br>  To understand this, I‚Äôll tell the story of the fictional character Jared, who is the typical product manager. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kw/1z/nh/kw1znh3tduhtouj6bzfplno2pkm.png"><br><br>  Suppose he occupies a responsible position in a large company and he has several distributed teams.  He has typical problems: many projects simultaneously running, lack of transparency in these projects, problems with processes. <br><br>  His team constantly makes mistakes and works inefficiently.  Accordingly, they cannot increase product growth rates.  Suddenly, Jared finds out about the existence of a Jira tool that can help solve his problems. <br><br>  Let's imagine what Jared may encounter when he begins to understand an unfamiliar product, if his interface does not imply onboarding. <br><br>  What does Jared see?  He sees the project, boards, sprints, backlog, roadmap.  And he is perplexed.  But he is perplexed because he does not understand how his problems can be solved with the help of this set of actions that the tool offers. <br><br>  Tools by definition do not solve user problems.  There are solutions for this.  Tools must be configured in detail, only after that they can solve the problem. <br><br>  The user first of all wants to decide for himself whether this tool is suitable for his case, whether the tool can solve his problems.  And the main purpose of onboarding is to help him answer these questions and evaluate the proposed solution for him. <br><br>  Onboarding is not about learning how to use a product.  Your user is well aware that he will not solve his problems in two hours and does not try to do it. <br><br><h4>  Onboarding is about selling faith </h4><br>  Selling the belief that a product is capable of solving a particular user's problem.  If we sold the faith and the buyer believes, he will invest time and money in our product.  Most likely, it will even postpone all other decisions that were considered before. <br><br><h4>  Onboarding is about positioning, repackaging the product for different verticals. <br></h4><br>  What does it mean?  Some products have a lot of features.  For example, in Wrike there are more than 100‚Äì150.  And for different segments of users - for example, for marketers, HR, product managers, and so on - different functions are needed, as each has its own cases and pains.  Depending on the specifics of each segment - you need to build your positioning, communication and packaging of the product. <br><br><h4>  Onboarding is a demonstration of solutions or cases right out of the box. <br></h4><br>  The human brain operates on images.  This is the structure of the neural structure.  When a user comes to a product, we need to make him believe in him as soon as possible.  For this we provide him with an image, a familiar pattern that reminds him of his problem.  Then he begins to notice things similar to his experience and realizes the value of the product much faster. <br><br><h4>  Onboarding is to keep and accompany the buyer on the way to making a purchase. <br></h4><br>  Onboarding should increase the likelihood of conversion.  Suppose a hundred people come into the product.  According to statistics, on average there are two or three, maybe even ten users.  Few.  At the same time, on average in the industry 60% of users leave after the first session and never return.  Why?  Because faith in the product was not sold. <br><br>  Onboarding is the very first impression of the product, which further shapes the attitude to the product and influences the decision to purchase.  The task of onboarding is that the user is positioned towards the product and understands its values.  And only at the very least - this is the basic grocery guiding.  And the harder your product is, the smaller this component is. <br><br>  <b>The classic scheme of any b2b business:</b> <b><br></b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wj/qv/vx/wjqvvxlbafzqpv2s2g2g_pmta9s.png"><br><br>  Marketing is the initial stage of selling faith, where we show sexy pictures on the landing page with successful people who have already solved their problems with the help of a tool.  Then there is onboarding - this is the first stage of selling faith, a deeper one, where you can already exploit the product. <br><br>  Next comes the sales department.  This is the second and final stage of the sale of faith, where there are already specially trained people who know how to sell.  And only then we do the training and detailed customization of the product, its customization.  This function is usually performed by various professional services. <br><br>  And only at the end, after all these steps, we have a happy user, who got his benefit. <br><br><blockquote>  Onboarding sells the belief that the product will solve a specific problem, fully accompanying it on the way to purchase, demonstrating to the user a solution and specific cases. <br></blockquote><br><h3>  Son: about the significance of feedback </h3><br>  ‚ÄúYou cannot improve what you cannot measure,‚Äù Edwards Deming, Peter Drucker. <br><br>  Obvious things follow from this quote that can be applied to onboarding.  We cannot improve onboarding if we cannot measure it correctly. <br><br>  The correct metric and its constant measurements are very important.  Otherwise, you will just guess or measure something wrong, say, the number of clicks in the first session, which speaks of absolutely nothing. <br><br>  And we at Wrike for a very long time tried to find the right metric.  We tried different things: activity at the first session, duration of the first session, retention, and so on. <br><br>  We faced problems, like many, where the conversion depends on the sales and marketing department.  To get results, you need to run A / B tests for conversions.  If you have a b2b business, then you can wait for significance for years.  And early conversion rates are poorly interpreted. <br><br>  Based on this, we came to the conclusion that it is necessary to collect feedback from users. <br><br>  Three ways to do this: <br><br>  - Step one - determine the purpose of onboarding. <br>  - Step two - ask the user directly about this in the first session. <br>  - Step three - profit. <br><br>  In fact, this is a NPS-like question.  We asked the user two questions.  One closed with the answer option, the other open. <br><br>  The first one sounded like this: ‚ÄúHow much do you think‚Äú Revolut for business ‚Äùwould solve your problem?‚Äù And they provided a scale from one to ten.  If the boarding did not work, the user responds: "One."  When the user has selected a digit, in the same window we ask him: ‚ÄúExplain the reason for his answer‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/aq/sd/l-/aqsdl-vzujdxof2rqtrejhhozqs.png"><br><br><h3>  What did it give us? <br></h3><br>  1) Correlation with business metrics.  If the metric grows, obviously, we fulfill our goal correctly and make the onboarding process more qualitative. <br><br>  2) Flexibility.  The metric can be considered differently.  For example, using NPS, with a focus on increasing attractors, with a focus on reducing detractors.  You can use the classic balanced version.  You can watch the average median and apply other statistics. <br><br>  3) Priceless feedback.  He will help us learn why users left the product after the first session. <br><br><h3>  Holy Spirit: positioning <br></h3><br>  And the last story is a case from Wrike.  We found that positioning and packaging is the most important factor affecting conversion growth. <br><br>  So, we decided to try launching the vertical product Wrike for Marketers.  In general, this is the same Wrike, only we positioned it exclusively to marketers.  We made a separate landing page, a separate advertising campaign, another pricing. <br><br>  But we did not change anything, except for three things: <br><br>  <b>Customer boarding flow.</b>  When the user entered the product interface, promotional materials for a specific vertical appeared during onboarding and registration, which ‚Äúspoke the same language with him‚Äù and solved his problems. <br><br>  <b>Default pre-configuration.</b>  Further, when the user got into the product, he came in and saw something similar to what he should receive in the end.  That is, it is just a pre-installed product.  It already had projects, tasks and reports by default.  All things fit the work situations that he is very familiar with.  This allowed to deepen the understanding of the product. <br><br>  <b>Repackaging.</b>  We took the usual ‚ÄúWrike‚Äù product and included paid add-on integration in its cost, which were relevant to marketers.  And they liked it. <br><br>  *** <br>  More product marketing reports available at the <a href="https://tgclick.ru/epicgrowth/159">@epicgrowth</a> Telegram Channel. <br><br>  Epic Growth Conference (www.egconf.ru) is a product marketing conference organized by Mobio and Getloyal with the support of myTracker, Minimob and AppMetrica. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/452994/">https://habr.com/ru/post/452994/</a></p>
