Someone for the weekend goes to the neighboring regions, and someone, with more wealth, flies off to unplanned vacation.  There are no tickets, airports are overcrowded, flights are delayed and the only source of news for people stuck and exhausted at the airport is the Internet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7b1/fb6/abe/7b1fb6abe6d21ca573a99c14d82e9d6f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We decided to see how telecom operators work in such a heat at airports. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, we conducted our first research at the airports that surround the capital - Vnukovo, Domodedovo and Sheremetyevo.  All airports can be reached by Aeroexpress for 300 rubles one way, which we used.

      At a low start, operator coverage maps were examined to give an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwho offers what at airports. <br>  <a href="http://moscow.megafon.ru/coverage/current/">MegaFon</a> and <a href="http://www.mts.ru/coverage/mts/moscow/">MTS</a> coverage cards let us know that we will get 3G at all three airports.  Yota says the Internet only in Sheremetyevo, and, judging by the map, very little did not reach Vnukovo. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b24/528/015/b245280156856cdffb4754b972ad393f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The Moscow coverage of Comstar is limited to the Moscow Ring Road. <br><br>  Beeline was most surprised by the fact that they already have two ( <a href="">1</a> , <a href="">2</a> ) coverage maps on their website at the same time.  And, even more surprisingly, Moscow is not on any of them.  The list of cities with maps is quite large, but there is no capital - apparently, they are hiding something. <br><br><h2>  Testing method </h2><br>  <a href="http://gtoday.ru/blog/99.html">We had enough manure with modems</a> , we were able to bring them all into working condition.  In addition to modems, we got a completely ‚Äúclean‚Äù netbook (without a built-in WiMax module), which was not equipped with any additional software, except for applications that came with the modems.  All devices are connected via the same USB port.  In the case of Wi-Fi, we used exclusively open access points. <br>  At all airports, we climbed into one of the waiting rooms, choosing a place as close as possible to the window, trying to get closer to the behavior of an ordinary user.  To measure the speed of data transmission, our ‚Äú <a href="http://gtoday.ru/map/">dissenting opinion</a> ‚Äù service was used. <br><br><h2><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b24/e51/b76/b24e51b769aa6ce1083e95c3fd78156d.png" alt="image">  Vnukovo </h2><br>  We left Vnukovo from the Kiev railway station.  The cars are hot, there is no air conditioning, but quickly - the travel time was 37 minutes.  A pleasant surprise was the final station, in my opinion, the most spectacular among all airports.  But, unfortunately, on this pleasantness ended.  Vnukovo is a huge construction site and a small building of the old airport, in which there is nothing to breathe and rather dirty. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/151/e27/8c5/151e278c5a4186ca607031304afeaf61.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the second tier of the building, we found a waiting room with the most uncomfortable seats among all airports.  Having settled in 2 seats from the window, we armed ourselves with modems. <br><br>  The results are as follows: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/94a/2c3/d2a/94a2c3d2ac2b63ff3160f39700d5d652.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The first thing that catches the eye in this table is the lack of results from Yota and Comstar - indeed, WiMax is not represented at the airport.  But Megaphone perfectly covers the airport with its 3G, demonstrating a stable 5-6 megabits.  MTS is doing pretty well too - we were able to comfortably surf.  Beeline is all bad - we even had to get up from our familiar place in the waiting room and go to the dense window, but even so the connection was constantly torn.  Perhaps this is due to the heavy load on the base stations in this zone, but this does not change the essence of the matter - it is impossible to use such Internet. <br>  Just need to say that there is paid Wi-Fi, but it is paid, the prices are not stated anywhere, how to use it, too.  Because of the large queues, we did not dare to make the feat, but apparently, nobody uses them there, except for the employees themselves) <br><br><h2><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b24/e51/b76/b24e51b769aa6ce1083e95c3fd78156d.png" alt="image">  Domodedovo </h2><br>  In Domodedovo, we went by aeroexpress for all the same 300 rubles - the difference is that there are already working ticket sales terminals at the Paveletsky railway station, so it‚Äôs not necessary to stand in line at the ticket office.  It was not so hot in the cars - either because of the half-empty car, or because of the air conditioning system.  I had to go a little longer - 47 minutes. <br>  At the airport, I immediately went to the waiting room - it is located above the passenger check-in desks, on the second tier.  Rising, I found this picture above. <br>  MTS has branded a passenger collection point in the center of the airport, distributing around free Wi-Fi.  Another advantage is the ‚Äústand‚Äù with chargers for more phones.  Of course, we decided not to pass by - it's a sin not to use such a freebie. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d25/0bb/58d/d250bb58daebe771e4067adf54a37d54.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the waiting room on the second tier, behind one of the caffeine, there was a row of chairs standing right in front of the window.  Convenient in all senses and "sit" and "measure". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a3/348/6ca/3a33486caeab8ab79cdbbd73e2cee128.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Of the GSM operators, Megafon alone provides a more or less tolerable speed at EDGE.  Although the site stated that the airport is in 3G coverage. <br>  Beeline ... once again everything is bad, although not as bad as in Vnukovo.  The speed was low, but stable - enough only for urgent checking of mail, twitter or ICQ. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1e8/56a/d25/1e856ad252bb51f3cafb047196e680d1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  MTS showed the worst result - the speed was the lowest.  But I believe that this deficiency is more than offset by the distribution of free Wi-Fi.  It may not be too fast, but it‚Äôs free.  And how many people she serves ... Russia! <br>  WiMax-ohm again did not even smell. <br><br><h2><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b24/e51/b76/b24e51b769aa6ce1083e95c3fd78156d.png" alt="image">  Sheremetyevo </h2><br>  At the Belorussky railway station, from which Aeroexpress to Sheremetyevo goes, there are also ticket terminals.  But a ticket for the ‚Äúbusiness class‚Äù can only be bought at the box office - it was there that promised (for 500 rubles) Wi-Fi, increased comfort, guaranteed seating and cold water - it was only for the last point that it was decided to fork out. <br>  The trip took 35 minutes.  Wi-Fi turned out to be the usual Yota, the connection was interrupted twice for 5-6 minutes (15-20 and 25-30 minutes on the way).  Water, condo and comfort were really available. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e00/956/152/e00956152b6e513301c7c8b9d46c8891.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  You can write for a long time about the journey between the terminals and attempts to understand the new numbering.  Perhaps I will tell it in the comments, if someone is interested.  But before we get back to the point, let me tell you how the numbering has changed: <br><br>  Sheremetyevo 1 - Sheremetyevo B <br><br>  New terminal Sheremetyevo 1 - Sheremetyevo S <br><br>  Sheremetyevo 2 - Sheremetyevo F <br><br>  New terminal Sheremetyevo 2 - Sheremetyevo E <br><br>  Sheremetyevo 3 - Sheremetyevo D <br><br>  Terminal Aeroexpress - Railway station where trains arrive from Moscow. <br><br>  So, below are comparative tables with a breakdown by terminal.  In terminals F and B there was again free Wi-Fi from MTS - even if not everywhere, but it is in the waiting rooms, and it is quite possible to use it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/008/69e/e99/00869ee998a9d37edf00706772932f0a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5ab/ff5/297/5abff5297e24f693b5e9f44adeeeb174.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3da/e93/f7a/3dae93f7ac78825853d20226dd115d46.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Draw your own conclusions :) <br><br><h2>  The end </h2><br>  In general, we were pleased with the study - it was interesting to ride with an unusual goal.  As for the Internet - if you really want to, then you can go to the network at any airport, however, hardly anyone wants to carry with them a whole set of modems.  Let the wireless access operators still cannot provide a sufficiently high level of service, but they are trying in every way to close this gap.  All airports have Wi-Fi in one form or another - free of charge from MTS, paid Beeline Wi-Fi and Green Zone from Megaphone (at crazy prices), as well as paid access points from airports. <br><br>  Perhaps we just arrived unsuccessfully and, perhaps, on other days, operators show much more optimistic results.  So our research in no way pretend to be complete.  But I really do not want to spend the best years of my life driving around the airports - it will be great if someone confirms or denies our numbers on our <a href="http://gtoday.ru/map/">special map</a> , thereby making a contribution to the socially useful business.  Indeed, the more accurate the statistics, the more measurements will be taken.  After some time, we plan to repeat the measurements, including Skylink.  We also call for measurements of all owners of wireless modems from mobile operators. <br><br>  On the way, the results of measurements from the waiting rooms of stations and something else - who are interested, do not switch;) <br><br>  First image: Press Center of <a href="http://svo.aero/">Sheremetyevo International Airport</a> OJSC <br>  <b>Successes!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/101313/">https://habr.com/ru/post/101313/</a></p>
