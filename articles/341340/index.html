  <section class="page js-page"><h1>SAP HANA Support: New Features</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In-memory SAP HANA DBMS and applications using it are becoming increasingly popular with companies.  And this growth encourages developers of infrastructure solutions for SAP HANA to offer the most convenient and beneficial solutions for customers.  Today we will talk about the options offered by Fujitsu. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ct/ko/gk/ctkogkrek-vm3e9zcj1m2tizujm.jpeg"><br>  <i>Fujitsu PRIMEQUEST 3800B</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Not only appliance </h3><br>  Fujitsu, as a global technology partner of SAP, offers customers three options for building infrastructure.  In addition to the classic pre-configured and tested hardware and software systems (appliance), these are solutions based on the Tailored Datacenter Integration (TDI) approach, which implies customer self-assembly of such a solution from SAP-certified components, and an integrated solution FlexFrame for SAP Landscapes, better known as FlexFrame Orchestrator. <br><br><h3>  New servers and storage </h3><br>  In recent months, changes have been implemented regarding, first of all, support for server hardware.  As you know, on July 11, Intel introduced a new processor platform for servers called Skylake.  Simultaneously with this event, Fujitsu announced the release of the eight-processor rack server PRIMEQUEST 3800B, which received certification for working with SAP HANA.  Accordingly, the use of a new server allows customers to deploy an S4 / HANA or SAP Business Suite platform with scaling up to 12 TB, or scaling up to 6 TB with SAP Business Warehouse on HANA within a single server.  Compared with the capabilities of the previous generation servers, the numbers have increased by one and a half times, since SAP allows using more RAM on the server where a more powerful processor is installed.  The standard benchmark applications SAP Sales and Distribution (SD), performed in the Windows Server operating system, Fujitsu PRIMEQUEST 3800B showed a record response time - only 0.78 seconds, and also demonstrated the processing of 11,242,000 transactions per hour, while 101,000 simultaneous work users. <br><br>  Fujitsu's second Intel-based Skylake, a four-processor PRIMERGY RX4770 M4 server, also received similar certification in late October.  The customer can use these products not only as a ready-made appliance, but also as a platform for building your own hardware system according to the TDI model.  As for dual-processor servers on the Intel Skylake platform, they have not yet received support from SAP, so Fujitsu plans to continue to offer customers the previous generation dvuhsoketnye machines.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fn/6_/dx/fn6_dxysnffhwptoeam8bqmw-ja.jpeg"><br>  <i>Fujitsu PRIMERGY RX4770 M4</i> <br><br>  There have been changes in the segment of data storage systems used in TDI-projects.  They touched certification.  Thus, the entire line of All-Flash storage arrays, including the ETERNUS AF250 and ETERNUS AF650, as well as the new storage system for small and medium businesses ETERNUS DX200 S4, received certification.  Thus, the Fujitsu portfolio already has a full range of storage arrays for working with SAP HANA. <br><br><h3>  Options for co-locating SAP HANA systems on a single server </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/co/pf/fq/copffqf0kmijeg8gpsb3ec4y99g.jpeg"><br><br>  As more and more SAP applications start using SAP HANA as the main DBMS, the customer has more and more instances of the SAP HANA DBMS in the landscape and, as a result, there is a desire to combine several instances on the same physical server. <br><br>  There are a number of options for hosting several systems based on SAP HANA on a single server.  The first version of MCOS provides for the placement of several versions of HANA in one instance of the operating system.  Moreover, it can be both productive and unproductive systems.  The next version of MDC provides for the placement in the same HANA instance of several isolated containers for various SAP systems.  The third placement option involves the use of virtual machines.  Of the hypervisors available on the market, SAP supports only VMware.  Unfortunately, the deployment of virtual machines with SAP HANA to servers running Intel Skylake processors is not yet supported.  But in the case of the previous generation of servers, support for VMware from SAP will be available without restrictions.  In addition, restrictions on the number of installed virtual machines on a single server are reduced ‚Äî up to 8 machines for productive systems and an unlimited number of machines for unproductive systems.  All this opens up a number of new opportunities for the customer, and allows you to build fairly complex solutions. <br><br>  Separately, Fujitsu offers customers a special option to support HANA systems.  We are talking about the allocation of physical partitions on the servers PRIMEQUEST 2800E3 and PRIMEQUEST 3800E (the release of which is scheduled for November of this year).  On an 8-processor server, you can select up to four isolated partitions (partitions).  In fact, this means that there are four hardware independent servers in one machine.  This placement option is also supported by SAP. <br><br><h3>  Extended FlexFrame Orchestrator Features </h3><br>  Updates touched and FlexFrame for SAP Landscapes (FlexFrame Orchestrator).  They are associated primarily with the release of new hardware solutions.  In addition, the release of new software packages will also expand the capabilities of this product.  Four new packages have been released so far. <br><br>  One of these packages, called Automatic Fast High Availability for HANA System Replication, automates the process of switching from a primary server to a backup server in the case of using HANA System Replication.  The second package Holistic Monitoring for the SAP Basis Team allows you to provide advanced monitoring of not only the hardware, but also the software part of SAP systems.  It provides customer IT professionals with a detailed picture of the state of the infrastructure and applications.  The third package, Connector for SAP, LaMa Integration automates the integration of the infrastructure built and managed by FlexFrame Orchestrator with SAP Landscape Management (LaMa).  Thus, all the necessary settings in SAP LaMa are not made manually, but in an automated mode.  Finally, the fourth package, Integrated and Automated Backup &amp; Recovery, is designed to integrate backup and recovery processes between SAP and the storage system itself.  It allows you to automate the backup process at the level of snapshots, checking the integrity of copies, as well as the cloning of SAP systems. <br><br>  A few years ago, pre-configured hardware solutions (appliance) were the only support option that third-party developers could offer for customers introducing new products based on SAP HANA or migrating to a new platform from systems of previous generations.  Today this spectrum has expanded significantly.  At the same time, working with HANA requires a high level of expertise from either the customer or the vendor or system integrator leading the project. <br><br>  Fujitsu has both global and local competencies in choosing the most optimal equipment and deployment options for systems based on HANA.  In more detail about all the updates of Fujitsu products for working with SAP HANA can be found out during the new webinar, which is scheduled for November 2017 (follow the announcements on our blog). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/341340/">https://habr.com/ru/post/341340/</a></p>
